09-02-2021||New Delhi||Massage centre at Singhu to keep protesters going||The growing complaints of sore feet, stiff back or pain around the kneecap among the protesting farmers—especially the older ones—have led to opening of a makeshift massage centre at Singhu border.Six plastic chairs, rugs and mats on the floor and a “home-made” pain relief oil from Punjab are being used to help the visibly-tired protesters unwind and reduce their muscle tension.They have been camping at the border for over 70 days now in protest against the three contentious agri-laws, with no immediate end in sight for the agitation.Harpreet Singh, who already has his hands full with multiple services at the protest site, said he had heard enough people complaining about body aches and fatigue and not doing anything for them was just not an option.“Staying out for this long, without any homely comfort, in trolleys or tents takes a toll on your body. It is that much difficult if you are old, and here a large majority of people are in their 50s and 60s. The massage centre is to strengthen the muscles worn-out during the ongoing protest,” said the 22-year-old from Punjab’s Gurdaspur district.The massage centre, started three days back, opens as early as five in the morning and works till five in the evening.Singh, who has been camping here for the past two months, is joined by a couple of volunteers for this noble service.“It is a sewa. We don’t keep a count of people coming. But since you have asked, the numbers are increasing by the day,” said Singh as he gently rubs the foot of an elderly person with the herbal oil.Singh, who says he gets to sleep only “five hours a day”, is juggling other responsibilities too like helping the old get hot water in the morning for bathing, opening a makeshift reading room well-stocked with books—on farmers revolution, biography of freedom fighters—and volunteering at a nearby milk langar in the wee hours.The young and old benefitting from the services of the massage centre are all praises for Singh and his dedication towards the movement and its people.“My knee was giving me trouble for several days now. Yesterday, my friend told me about Singh and how effective the massage has proven for his joint pain.“I went to him and he massaged my knee also. I felt a lot better. Today, I have come for another round. May god bless him and other volunteers for helping us,” said Satwinder Singh (55), a farmer from Ludhiana.Earlier, NGO Khalsa Aid India had installed 25 foot-massagers for the elderly protesters.While routine everyday activities—like preparation and distribution of langar food, farmers making motivational speeches from stages, and tractors blaring protest songs—went on as usual; the Delhi-Haryana Highway, the epicentre of the ongoing farmers’ agitation, witnessed a rather slow day on Tuesday with both—the crowd and security forces—thinning out.Additional deployment of Delhi Police personnel at the three main farmers protest sites of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur was withdrawn from Monday evening.According to an order issued by Special Commissioner of Police (Operation and Licensing) Muktesh Chander the entire staff will go back to their respective districts or units with effect from Tuesday.Thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November at the Delhi borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/massage-centre-at-singhu-to-keep-protesters-going-210088

09-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||Harsimrat Badal attacks Modi govt, alleges intelligence failure on January 26||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 9Launching a fierce attack against the Narendra Modi Government of which she was a part of when it passed the three contentious farm Ordinances, Akali leader Harsimrat Badal on Tuesday said she constantly requested her Cabinet colleagues for wider consultations before bringing the laws, apprising them of growing unrest among the farming community.“But you did not listen to us, your oldest ally since times when you had just two MPs in the Parliament,” she told members of the Treasury Benches speaking on the motion of thanks on the President’s address in the Lok Sabha today.“It is a fact that Working Group on Consumer Affairs headed by then Gujarat CM (Prime Minister Modi) recommended protection of farmer interest by ensuring there was no farmer-trader transaction below MSP. What has changed since then,” she questioned.Demanding a probe, she also accused the Modi government of “intelligence failure” ahead of January 26. “Violence should not have happened. But when you (the Modi government) could lock down the country in four hours, announce demonetisation in a few hours, when you knew a day before (January 26) about what had been announced from a (farmers) stage why you could not block roads on the day,” she questioned.She also slammed the BJP leadership for “vilifying” the “Kesri Nishan”, questioning “why those who sacrificed most for national flag are being targeted”. Amid objections from BJP MPs, she said “those who called the farmers first ‘bicholia’ (middlemen), then Maoists, then naxalites, then ‘atankwadi’ (extremists), then Khalistanis are all sitting here. Tell me which farmer does AK-47 ki kheti”.Regarding the hoisting of ‘Kesri” flag at the Red Fort on January 26, Harsimrat said a lot has been said about “insult” of Tricolour to protect which “70 per cent of blood that has been shed has been from the (Sikh) community”. “This is the same ‘kesri’ PM Modi wears. For us (Sikh community) the Red Fort is a seat of oppression and tyranny, it is from here martyrdom of our ninth Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur was announced. He chose martyrdom to save your ‘janaeu’ and ‘tilak’,” she said.She also slammed PM Modi for giving names like “andolajeevi” and “parjeevi” to the agitators.Meanwhile, RLP’s Hanuman Beniwal from Rajasthan warned saying that the BJP should not be under any misconception that the agitation is limited to Punjab and Haryana. “You may have to sit in the Opposition next time,” he warned, claiming that “many BJP MPs have expressed fears to him in confidence that if laws are not taken back they may have to face problems in next elections”.“If the laws are so good why have you agreed to amend them…You should leave your ‘zid’ (stubbornness) because you have to go back to people. If you think that farmers will forget, you are wrong, they will not forget. When they see the (EVM) machine and see your button (Lotus symbol), they will remember,” Beniwal said demanding a law on MSP and repeal of the three farm laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/harsimrat-badal-attacks-modi-govt-alleges-intelligence-failure-on-january-26-210086
09-02-2021||New Delhi||FSSAI notifies regulations to limit trans fat in food items||Food regulator FSSAI on Tuesday said regulations to limit the content of trans fat in all food items have been notified.“With gazette of recent regulation to limit the content of trans fats in all food items, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) joins the league of several other nations globally having best practice policies for trans fat elimination,” the regulator said in a statement.India joins the club of around 40 countries globally that have already enacted the best practice policies to eliminate trans fats and would be among the first countries in Asia after Thailand in achieving the best-practice policies in trans fat elimination, it said.Under the regulation notified on December 29 last year, FSSAI said it has limited industrial TFA (trans fatty acids) to not more than 3 per cent in all fats and oils by January 2021 and not more than 2 per cent by January 2022.The Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restrictions on Sales) Second Amendment Regulations, 2021, has been notified earlier this month.This regulation states that all food products in which edible oils and fats are used as an ingredient should not contain industrial trans fatty acids more than 2 per cent by mass of the total oils/fats present in the product, on and from January 1, 2022.It also defines industrial trans fatty acids as: “All the geometrical isomers of mono-unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids having non-conjugated, interrupted by at least one methylene group, carbon-carbon double bonds in the trans configuration. It excludes trans-fatty acids from dairy, meat, fish and their products.”      Industrial trans fats are produced by adding hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them solid, which increases their stability at room temperature and extends shelf life. Trans fats are largely present in partially hydrogenated vegetable fats/oils, vanaspati, margarine and bakery shortenings. They are found in baked and fried foods.“Research has shown that higher intakes of industrially produced trans fatty acids (more than 1 per cent of total energy intake) are associated with increased risk of high cholesterol and heart diseases,” FSSAI said.According to 2017 estimates, every year more than 1.5 million deaths in India is attributed to coronary heart disease, of which nearly 5 per cent (71,000) are due to trans fats intake.Elimination of industrial TFA has been recognized as one the modifiable risk factors to prevent heart diseaes.“This is especially important in the present scenario, when COVID -19 is adding risk to people suffering from comorbidities like hypertension, heart diseases, diabetes etc,” it added.In 2018, the WHO called for elimination of industrially-produced trans fat from the food supply by 2023 and released an action package ‘REPLACE’ for the same. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fssai-notifies-regulations-to-limit-trans-fat-in-food-items-210085

09-02-2021||Hyderabad||Andhra CM Jagan’s sister hints at floating new political outfit in Telangana||Y S Sharmila, sister of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, on Tuesday held talks with her late father’s sympathisers here, triggering speculations of her possible political entry in Telangana.Responding to the development, the ruling YSRC in Andhra Pradesh said while Reddy and Sharmila do not have differences, the siblings only have “differences of opinion” over her political foray in this state.Sharmila’s father and late Y S Rajasekhara Reddy, widely known as YSR, was the Chief Minister of united Andhra Pradesh from 2004 to 2009.The Congress leader died in a chopper crash in September 2009.There have been rumours doing the rounds on social media over the past few days that Sharmila plans to start a political party in Telangana without her brother’s intervention.She is believed to be in touch with some prominent political leaders, who were closely associated with late Rajasekhara Reddy, eliciting their suggestions and opinion on bringing “Rajanna Rajyam” (a state envisaged by the late Reddy) in Telangana.“I want to understand the ground realities and to take their suggestions and the information they have...I called people from Nalgonda district. This is just a connection (with them).”“The meetings will be held with people from every district,” she told the media after the meeting.Asked if she would launch a political party, Sharmila said “there is no Rajanna Rajyam now. Why should it not come?My objective is to establish Rajanna Rajyam,” she said.To a query, she said, “Jagan Mohan Reddy is doing his job in AP and I will do mine in Telangana.” Sharmila and her mother Vijayamma had vigorously campaigned for the YSR Congress during the general elections in 2019.However, after the party clinched a landslide victory and Jagan took over the reins, Sharmila was not seen much in public.Responding to Sharmila’s possible political entry in Telangana, YSRC senior leader and Adviser to the AP Government, Sajjala Ramakrishna, said Jagan and Sharmila do not have differences, but only “differences of opinion” on her venturing into Telangana politics. “As a daughter of Rajasekhar Reddy she has leadership qualities,” Reddy said, addressing a press conference near Vijayawada. “People at various levels tried to convince her not to get into Telangana politics, but she took a decision...she has to face the political consequences,” he said.He opined that since YSRC decided not to be active in other states, including Telangana, she may have independently decided to fill the gap by going there.The K Chandrasekhar Rao-led Telangana Rashtria Samiti (TRS), has been ruling the state, which came into existence in 2014, winning two back to back assembly elections.Sharmila met sympathisers of Rajasekhara Reddy from the united Nalgonda district at the family’s residence at Lotus Pond here.Konda Ragava Reddy, a senior YSRC leader of the Telangana unit, told reporters that Sharmila will float a political party and take the ideology to the masses.According to him, the announcement will be made at a public meeting at Chevella in Rangareddy District in Telangana in the coming days.Several banners with portraits of Sharmila and Rajasekhar Reddy were erected at the residence.Jagan’s image was conspicuously missing in the banners and flex boards.Hundreds of people gathered at the residence and cheered as she came out.They burst crackers and shouted slogans like “YSR johar” in memory of the deceased leader.A YSR Congress worker from Utnoor in Adilabad said he strongly wants Sharmila to float a party in order to bring “Rajanna Rajyam” (Rajasekhar Reddy’s regime) in Telangana also.Though the YSRC has a presence in Telangana, it did not contest in the last general elections.Sharmila undertook a ‘Padayatra’ when Jagan was imprisoned in connection with a quid pro quo case in 2012.

09-02-2021||Jodhpur (Rajasthan)||Court to pronounce order on February 11 on plea against Salman Khan for ‘false’ affidavit in Arms Act case||A District and Sessions court is likely to pronounce on Thursday its order on a plea against actor Salman Khan for alleged submission of a false affidavit related to his arms licence in the court in 2003.Arguments on the applications were completed on Tuesday and the Judge Raghvendra Kachhwala reserved the order for February 11.The trial court had in June 2019 absolved Khan of the allegation of filing a false affidavit. But the state government had filed an appeal against this order in the District and Sessions court.Khan had filed the affidavit in the court in 2003 in the case against him under Arms Act stating that he had lost his arms licence.The prosecution had argued that he had submitted a false affidavit as his licence was not lost but submitted for renewal.“We argued that it was not intentional to submit this affidavit as Khan was a busy actor and had no exact idea about his licence at that time,” said Khan’s counsel HM Saraswat said.He argued that if the accused has submitted a false affidavit by mistake and he has no advantage of such an act, he should be forgiven and absolved from the allegations.The prosecution had already completed its arguments in the matter while the defence concluded on Tuesday.The matter is linked to a case against Khan under the Arms Act, in which the actor had been accused of keeping arms with an expired licence and using them for poaching. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/court-to-pronounce-order-on-february-11-on-plea-against-salman-khan-for-false-affidavit-in-arms-act-case-210068

This means Covishield and COVAXIN are superbly safe. The fact that over 6.3 million people have accepted the vaccines shows we have overcome the challenge of vaccine hesitancy,” Member Health, NITI Aayog, VK Paul said today noting that India was on course to cross one crore vaccinations in a couple of days.6-7 vaccines in pipeline, says VK PaulThe government has asked every state to schedule every healthcare worker and frontline worker once for vaccination before February 20 and March 1, respectively, and cover them through mop up rounds by February 24 and March 6 respectively. “Those who miss the mop up rounds would then only be covered later through age appropriate listing,” Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.Also, the National AEFI Committee met this week to discuss 8 AEFIs (two of them deaths and three hospitalisations). Those hospitalised were treated and sent home. Two deaths were found unrelated to the COVID jabs.India has also emerged the fastest country to reach six million vaccinations in 24 days as against US which took 26 days and the UK which took 46.While 12 states, including Himachal Pradesh (68.7 pc coverage), have covered over 65 pc healthcare and frontline beneficiaries, 11 states continue to lag at coverage rates below 40 pc coverage.The laggards include Chandigarh 28.7 pc; Punjab 34.1 pc; JK 37.5 pc; Delhi 38.9 pc and Ladakh 35.8 pc.Overall pandemic situation remains satisfactory with 15 states including Delhi reporting zero new deaths in 24 hours and seven states and UTs reporting nil deaths in the last three weeks.India’s total COVID cases are 1.08 crore with only 1.32 pc of these (1.43 lakh) active cases. Total deaths are 1.55 lakh and are consistently declining.“Trends of daily deaths under 100 are consistent for many days now,” said Paul with 96 average daily deaths last week and 5.35 pc cumulative positivity rate.Kerala with 65, 670 active cases and Maharashtra with 35991 are contributing 71 pc of India’s active case load.The good news is 33 states have less than 5,000 active cases and there has been 55 pc decline in average daily deaths in the last five weeks. New deaths per million in India in the last 7 days have been 0.5 as against UK’s 96.

09-02-2021||New Delhi||SC dismisses plea challenging colonial era provision of sedition, says no cause of action||The Supreme Court Tuesday dismissed a plea which challenged the Constitutional validity of colonial era provision of sedition under the Indian Penal Code, on the ground that it is being used to stifle freedom of speech and expression of citizens.A bench of Chief Justice Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian dismissed the plea saying that there was no cause of action and the petitioners are not the affected parties.During the brief hearing, senior advocate Anoop George Chaudhary, appearing for the petitioners who are advocates, said this is a public interest matter and people are being charged under the provision.The bench observed that a law cannot be challenged without appropriate cause of action.“You are not facing any prosecution under the Section. What is the cause of the action? We don’t have any case before us right now. We don’t have any case in front of us where somebody is rotting in jail. If someone is in jail then we will consider. Dismissed,” the bench told Chaudhary.The plea filed by three advocates Aditya Ranjan, Varun Thakur, V Elanchezhiyan said section 124-A of IPC (sedition), the provision which was used by the British against Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak is still stifling the freedom of speech and expression in the country if they choose to express dissent against policies of the Governments in power.“It is submitted that under the continuously expanding scope of the fundamental rights, a colonial provision like section 124-A which was intended to subjugate the subjects of British crown should not be permitted to continue in a democratic republic,” the plea said.It said a constitution bench of the top court had in 1962 upheld the validity of section 124-A of IPC in Kedar Nath Singh versus State of Bihar by reading down the provision and preferring a narrow interpretation of ‘sedition’ to save the provision from unconstitutionality.“However, after six decades of experience with the sedition law, it is clear that the said judgment requires reconsideration especially in the light of spate of sedition charges imposed against various persons speaking out against the governments of the day and their policies. Section 124-A has a chilling effect on any dissenting free speech and/or criticism of the government which is an essence of democracy,” it said.The plea sought declaring of section 124-A as ultra-vires of the constitution and alternatively direction to DGPs to ensure that top court’s 1962 verdict is strictly followed.The lawyers in their plea submitted that the continuance of a draconian colonial provision like section 124-A in the penal code without corresponding safeguards as provided under the UAPA is “unreasonable and unwarranted”.“Neither there is any institutional responsibility on the Police in case of misuse of section 124-A of IPC nor are any procedural safeguards provided in code of Criminal Procedure unlike UAPA. Therefore, now section 124-A needs to be examined under the changed facts and circumstances and also on the anvil of ever evolving tests of necessity, proportionality and arbitrariness,” the plea said.They said that despite the interpretation of law of sedition to save it from unconstitutionality, the provision of sedition is being “grossly abused” across the geographical spectrum of this country.“Section 124-A of the Indian Penal Code instils a certain chilling effect on the general public at large inasmuch as it recognises ‘sedition’ as a criminal offence and the consequence of committing ‘sedition’ are excessive damages and penalties which are substantial punishments,” the plea said.The plea said that mere slapping of charge of sedition against a citizen endangers the right to live with dignity of the person and his family members forever.It said the media portrays the person charged as “Deshdrohi” (anti-national) whereas the seditious activities are imputed against the Government and in Hindi it may translate into “Raj Droh” (anti-government) which is not the same as “Deshdroh” and cannot be equated.“It causes chilling effect on other citizens and prevents them from exercising their fundamental right to criticize the Government and its policies through legitimate means. Our freedom fighters were charged by the Britishers under section 124-A but they were not “anti-national”. The social and political stigma attached to a person charged under section 124-A is irreparable,” the plea said.It referred to the decision of top court in decriminalising section 377 of IPC in 2018 and scrapping of section 66A of IT Act in 2015, where constitutional provisions were given a re-look.“It is, therefore, imperative and the need of the hour that a colonial provision like section 124-A which is very severe and actually being misused frequently in contravention of the law laid down by this court may be tested on the anvil of the expanding scope of fundamental rights in the twenty first century,” the plea said.

09-02-2021||Hyderabad||Telangana CLP leader starts 13-day statewide farmers interaction tour||Continuing his protest against the farm bills passed by the Union Government and demanding the continuation of agriculture produce purchase canters in the state, the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhatti Vikramarka Mallu and other party MLAs and MLCs on Tuesday started a 13-day statewide tour “Raithulato Mukhamukhi” (direct interaction with farmers). Mallu said the awareness and protest march started from Adilabad and will cover several districts before finally culminating in Khammam District on the 21st February.   During this march, Mallu and other party leaders will interact with farmers and spread awareness of the “hidden agenda” in the farm laws.As part of the tour program, the delegation of the Congress leaders will be visiting markets and agricultural fields.  He lashed out at the state government for its sheer negligence, and incapacity to come to the rescue of farmers and for its utter failure in all the fronts.He said CM KCR had taken a U-turn on the draconian farm Laws being brought in by the NDA government soon after KCR’s Delhi trip.The CLP leader said people in Telangana are not slaves like KCR and them, especially, farmers would fight tooth and nail till the farm laws, which were enacted to help the big corporates, are withdrawn unconditionally. This tour program is also aimed to rebuild confidence among the farmers who are under distress due to the pro-corporate policies adopted by the Union Government and the State Government.  CLP leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka has been in the forefront vehemently protesting against the Union Farm Bills.Mallu organised relay fast at Indira Park in Hyderabad in January, in November 2020, and he had organised a 60-kilometre tractor rally in Khammam district besides a human chain protest and Raitu Kavatu (farmers march). Listing out the exploitation of farmers under the KCR rule, the CLP leader said under the Fasal Bhima Yojana, though farmers have paid their share, the state government did not put in its share resulting in stoppage of Rs 960 Crore funds.This is directly harming the farmers, he concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-clp-leader-starts-13-day-statewide-farmers-interaction-tour-210061
09-02-2021||New Delhi||Union Panchayati Raj Ministry proposes Finance Ministry to implement Centre’s 'SWAMITVA' scheme across India||The Union Panchayati Raj Ministry has proposed to the Finance Ministry’s Department of Expenditure for extension of Centre’s “SWAMITVA” scheme across India.It is being presently implemented in nine states, including Haryana and Punjab, on pilot basis.Panchayti Raj Ministry’s Secretary Sunil Kumar informed that the proposal for the extension of scheme’s implementation is with an outlay of over Rs 566 crore to cover nearly 5.41 lakh villages. The Union Budget 2021-22 provides allocations of Rs 200 crores for the scheme’s implementation in 16 states targeting 2.30 lakh villages.The scheme was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 24, 2020 — the National Panchayati Raj Day. Distribution of property cards was rolled out by him on October 1.SVAMITVA — Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas — is to provide ‘record of rights’ to village household owners possessing houses in inhabited villages and issuance of “property cards” to the property owners following survey of village areas with help of drone technology by Survey of India.The overarching plan is to prepare GIS based maps for each village which would help in effective village level planning.The scheme covers multifarious aspects including facilitating monetisation of properties and enabling bank loan and reducing property related disputes.The pilot phase of the scheme had been approved with a budget outlay of Rs 79.65 crore.The other states where scheme is being implemented are Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh.Till January 31, “Drone Survey” has been completed in about 23,300 villages. Property Cards have been prepared and distributed under distribution to about 2.30 lakh property holders of about 1,432 villages.Kumar said a total of Rs 913.43 crore has been provided to Panchayat Raj Ministry in the Budget 2021-22 which marks 32 per cent increase over the revised estimate of 2020-21.The major part of it of Rs 593 crores is provided under the Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) — a centrally sponsored scheme that aims to strengthen Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) with main focus on convergence with “Mission Antyodya”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-panchayati-raj-ministry-proposes-finance-ministry-to-implement-centres-swamitva-scheme-across-india-210054
09-02-2021||Mumbai||Aadhaar-driving licence linking to reduce RTO crowds: Official||The Centre’s decision to link Aadhaar card with driving licence and vehicle registration certificate (RC) will considerably reduce crowds at Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) and make them free of agents and touts, a top Maharashtra government official has said.Transport Commissioner Avinash Dhakane, talking to reporters at his office here on Monday, said the Union government has issued a draft notification about linking driving licence and RC with Aadhaar, a unique 12-digit identity number assigned to residents of India.“The Government of India has already issued a draft notification for Aadhaar linkage. Once that happens and Vahan and Sarathi systems get linked with Aadhaar, crowds at RTOs will reduce to 20 per cent (from current level),” he said.Post-these changes, only a few people will have to visit RTOs for work related to driving licence and vehicle fitness, among others, the transport commissioner said.The Aadhaar linkage will eliminate the need for visiting RTOs and submitting documents, he said.Officials said the move will also curb forgery and end the menace of duplicate driving licences.According to Dhakane, at present the 50 RTOs spread across the state have footfalls of about 1.50 lakh daily.This number will go down below 40,000 or even more once Aadhaar card is linked with driving licence and RC, he said, adding the move will also make RTOs free of agents and touts.Many people prefer to get their work done through RTO agents and touts, who charge hefty amounts, leading to corruption and depriving citizens of better services, according to activists.In 2014-15, the then transport commissioner, Mahesh Zagade, had announced a ban on the entry of agents and touts inside RTO premises, but the change did not materialise on ground due to various reasons.Maharashtra has a vehicle population of nearly 3.5 crores and over 20 lakh new vehicles get registered annually.Also, the state has already issued over 3.5 crore permanent driving licences and around 10-15 lakh new ones are issued annually.According to transport department officials, recently they launched a provision of digital signature for obtaining learning licence, which has a validity of six months.People can authenticate their documents by digitally signing them.A senior official said the department has already received over 700 learning licence forms signed digitally since the start of this month. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aadhaar-driving-licence-linking-to-reduce-rto-crowds-official-210053

It led to a sudden rise in the water level of Rishiganga. Of the 197 persons reported missing, 139 are from the under-construction NTPC project, 46 were working on Rishiganga project and 12 were villagers.He said in the current financial year, Rs 1,041 crore has been allocated to Uttarakhand under the State Disaster Risk Management Fund and the first installment has been released.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/downstream-flooding-risk-recedes-amit-shah-on-chamoli-disaster-210052
09-02-2021||Mumbai||On Shah’s ‘openness’ jibe, Sena reminds of Fadnavis’s early morning swearing-in||Days after Union Home Minister Amit Shah said he does not make promises behind closed doors, the Shiv Sena on Tuesday said it too does things openly and does not resort to stealth.An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ asked whether BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis’s early morning swearing-in as chief minister after the 2019 state polls was an example of openness that Shah spoke about.On Sunday, Shah said he had not promised (as later claimed by the Uddhav Thackeray-led party) that the BJP will share the chief minister’s post if the Sena-BJP alliance won the 2019 polls. The two parties parted ways over this issue.During the event at Kankavali in Konkan region, Shah also said “whatever I do, I do it openly”.“The Shiv Sena too does what it does openly. It would not have formed a government with the Congress and NCP had that not been the case,” the Saamana said.BJP leaders were making such statements due to the “frustration” over the failure to retain power in Maharashtra, it added.It further asked how Fadnavis taking oath as CM at dawn with NCP’s Ajit Pawar as his deputy at Raj Bhavan in 2019 could be described as ‘doing things openly’.In an unexpected development, Fadnavis had taken oath as CM after alliance talks with the Sena broke down. But he had to resign as Pawar could not muster enough MLAs from the NCP.The Sena mouthpiece also said the country was facing serious problems including farmers’ protest on Delhi borders, and the Union home minister should pay attention to these issues.Displaced Kashmiri Pandits have not yet returned to Kashmir despite the abrogation of Article 370, the editorial said.On Shah’s statement that the Shiv Sena would have ceased to exist had the BJP taken on it, the editorial retorted that it was the Sena which finished off those who tried to finish it.The BJP would not have seen its present-day success if the Sena had taken on it, it said.Thanks to the BJP ‘not keeping its word’ about sharing the CM’s post, the Sena is now seeing “achche din” (good days), it said in another dig at the former ally.“And for that, the people of Maharashtra will forever be indebted to Amit Shah,” it quipped.Efforts were made and are being made to destabilize the Sena-NCP-Congress government in Maharashtra but those efforts will fail, it said.The editorial also took swipes at Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari without naming him. The state government in November recommended 12 names for appointment to the Legislative Council from the governor’s quota but the decision on them was pending, it said.Those who think that not taking a decision will rattle the government are living under illusion, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-shahs-openness-jibe-sena-reminds-of-fadnaviss-early-morning-swearing-in-210049
09-02-2021||Mumbai||HC to hear plea for Kangana Ranaut's Twitter account suspension on March 9||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday said it would hear a plea seeking either suspension or termination of the Twitter account of Kangana Ranaut on March 9 through the petitioner sought an urgent hearing claiming the actor recently posted a tweet calling the protesting farmers as "terrorists".The petitioner Ali Kashif Khan Deshmukh, who is an advocate, on Tuesday moved an application before a division bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale seeking urgent hearing on his petition, filed in December last year, seeking termination of Ranaut's Twitter account.In his application, Deshmukh cited certain tweets posted by Ranaut on Twitter in which she allegedly called the farmers, who are protesting at Delhi's borders against the three new farm laws, as "terrorists".The bench said it would be able to hear the plea only on March 9.In his petition, Deshmukh had claimed that Ranaut's posts on Twitter were spreading hatred among different religious communities.The Maharashtra government had, however, opposed the plea, saying it was vague.Last week, Twitter India had removed two of the tweets by Ranaut, citing a violation of the platform's rules.The actor has been criticising protesting farmers over their agitations against the Centre's three farm laws.Ranaut has been actively posting on Twitter since last Tuesday when international pop star Rihanna came out in support of the farmers' agitations.On February 5, a magistrate's court in Mumbai directed the police to submit a progress report on the inquiry it had ordered into a complaint filed by Deshmukh against Ranaut and her sister for posting alleged hateful messages on social media. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-to-hear-plea-for-kangana-ranauts-twitter-account-suspension-on-march-9-210048
09-02-2021||New Delhi||Farm laws: SC-appointed panel holds consultations with agro-processing industries||The Supreme Court-appointed committee on farms laws issue on Tuesday said it held consultations with agro-processing industries, including ITC and Amul on the legislations.This is the sixth meeting the panel has held so far. The three-member committee is holding consultations with stakeholders both through the online mode and in person.In a statement, the committee said it held interactions with various agro-processing industries, associations and procurement agencies on Tuesday.Amid the agitation by farmers who are camping on Delhi’s borders since November end, the Supreme Court had on January 12 stayed the implementation of the three contentious farm laws for two months and asked the committee to submit a report after consulting the stakeholders during this period.In total, 18 different stakeholder organisations participated through video conference in the detailed deliberation with the committee members, the panel said.These stakeholders included Amul, ITC, Suguna Foods, Venkateshwara Hatcheries, industry bodies CII and FICCI, as well as state-run Food Corporation of India, Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA).Among sector-specific associations, Horticulture Produce Exporters Association, Seafood Exporters Association, All India Rice Miller Association, All India Rice Exporters Association, Tractor Manufacture Association, Cotton Association of India, Fertiliser Association of India, India Pulses and Grain Association and All India Poultry Feed Manufacturer Association participated in the deliberations.Representatives of the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) participated in the meeting in person.“All the stakeholder participants gave their detailed views and valuable suggestions on the three farm laws,” the committee said in the statement.Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders for over two months now seeking the repeal of the new laws introduced by the Centre last year, claiming they were pro-corporate and could weaken the mandi system.The 11 rounds of the talks between the Centre and 41 protesting farmer unions have failed to end the deadlock even though the former has offered concessions including suspension of the legislations for 18 months which the unions have rejected.

They are also advised to carry enough personal provisions and funds to cater to any emergent requirements.”            Saudi Arabia suspended entry to the Kingdom for non-citizens from 20 specific countries, including India and Pakistan, as it stepped up efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic, the official Saudi Press Agency reported last Tuesday, citing an official source at the Interior Ministry.Indians, who are already in the UAE en route to Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, have been advised to consider returning to India and to make their further travel plan only after the restrictions in the final destinations countries are lifted.It may be noted that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have recorded more coronavirus-related deaths than the UAE, at 6,406 and 969 deaths respectively, according to Johns Hopkins University. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indians-advised-against-travelling-to-saudi-arabia-kuwait-via-uae-amidst-growing-coronavirus-cases-210043
09-02-2021||New Delhi||Pioneering paws: Indian Army using dogs to detect COVID-19 to cut time delay||In a first for the country, the Indian Army is using its dogs for quick detection of COVID-19 to cut down time delays associated with regular diagnostic techniques.The canine members of the armed force are known for their pronounced olfactory capability and have earlier helped in explosive and narcotics detection, search and rescue operations, and other challenging tasks. Now, they have another job.Two dogs – two-year-old cocker spaniel Casper and one-year-old Jaya, a ‘chippiparai’, which is an indigenous breed from Tamil Nadu – have been trained to detect COVID-19 by sniffing samples of sweat and urine, senior Army officials said.A demonstration of their skills using real samples was held on Tuesday on the premises of the 48 Military Veterinary Hospital at Delhi Cantonment. Their handlers were wearing full PPE kits.Lt Col Surinder Saini, instructor at the Dog Training Facility of the Remount Veterinary Corps (RVC) Centre in Meerut, said these dogs are “pioneering canines” of not just the Army, but of entire India.“Countries like the UK, Finland, France, Russia, Germany, Lebanon, the UAE and the US have already trained dogs for detection of COVID-19. Dogs have been previously used abroad to detect malaria, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease, but this is the first time canines have been used for medical detection in India,” he told reporters.To a question on where the dogs are being deployed, Saini said that after their training in September, the dogs were deployed at the Army’s transit camp in Delhi in November. From December, they are being deployed at the transit camp in Chandigarh from where troops move to large areas, including the Ladakh region, under the North Command.“Army dogs were successfully trained on specific biomarkers emanating from urine and sweat samples of positive patients. These samples do not contain living virus, but only volatile metabolic biomarkers, which the dogs have been trained to detect. Prior to bringing in front of them, to avoid any surface contact transmission to people handling the dogs, the samples are first exposed to UV rays,” Saini said.“This is the first time in India that the olfactory capability of canines are being used to detect tissues infected with pathogens releasing volatile metabolic biomarkers,” he added.The Indian Army has around 1,200 dogs, out of which nearly 700 are deployed, a senior official said.“Besides these two dogs, eight other dogs, including four labradors, are also undergoing training,” Saini said.One-year-old Mani, another chippiparai dog undergoing training, also showed his skills during the demonstration. Mani is the elder brother of Jaya.“The use of such canines in detection of COVID-19 can assist in quick and real time detection of the disease, and help in cutting down scale of RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests, both of which take time. And, in Army, time is of the essence. Besides, these dogs can be used at live events to screen people,” the instructor said.Saini said the dogs have sniffed out 22 positive cases of COVID-19 from 800 samples at the Delhi transit camp and nearly 3,000 samples at the Chandigarh transit camp.“Their response time after detection is one second or even less, and accuracy rate is over 90 per cent,” he said.The dogs have been trained to sit next to a sample kept in a container if it is positive for the disease and move forward after sniffing if it is negative, he added.Positive and suspected samples were obtained from the Military Hospital, Meerut Cantonment, and the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Subharti Medical College, Meerut, for the purpose of the training, officials said.“The sensitivity and specificity of both the dogs obtained from screening of 279 urine and 267 sweat samples during the initial trial procedure was found to be very high,” a senior official said.Scientifically, it is evident that infected body tissues release “unique volatile metabolic biomarkers”, which are used as disease signatures for detection of disease by medical detection dogs, he said.A concerted effort has been made to train an indigenous breed of dog under the prime minister’s initiative of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ besides a cocker spaniel to detect the “volatilome of COVID-19 disease from urine and sweat samples of positive cases by comparatory method”, the official said.These dogs are constantly monitored by their handlers, and their body temperature is recorded in the morning and the evening, the officials said.

Rs 3,000 crore) Shatoot Dam project has been pending for over two years following objections from Pakistan as it fears impediment to the regular flow of water.The dam is set to be built on Maidan River, a tributary of Kabul River which flows into Pakistan from Afghanistan.Last November, Jaishankar had announced an agreement with Afghanistan for building the Shatoot Dam was close at hand, while speaking at an international conference on Afghanistan.In tandem, India would launch the fourth phase of the High Impact Community Development Projects in Afghanistan involving over 100 projects worth $80 million (approx. Rs. 600 crore).This is the second major dam being built by India in Afghanistan, after the India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam (Salma Dam).India had earlier built the 202-km Phul-e-Khumri transmission line which provides electricity to large parts of Kabul city.India’s development portfolio in Afghanistan has to-date amounted to over $3 billion with no part of the country untouched by the 400 plus projects that India has undertaken in its 34 provinces. More than 65,000 Afghan students have also studied in India.Now, India is making efforts to reduce Afghanistan’s over-dependence on Pakistan for access to the sea.It is providing an alternate route by Chabahar port in Iran and has also opened a dedicated air freight corridor to Afghanistan.Speaking on the occasion, PM Modi said India had invested heavily in peace and development in Afghanistan and would want the gains of the past two decades to be preserved.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-inks-mou-to-build-second-dam-in-afghanistan-210035
09-02-2021||New Delhi||Protein behind less spread of coronavirus variant in Asia than Europe, North America: Study||Deficiency of a lung-protecting protein in the Caucasian population may have made Europe and North America more susceptible to the spread of a coronavirus variant as compared to Asia, suggests a study by Indian scientists which also reveals how mutant forms of the virus may find new ways to infect people.The study, published in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution, assessed the global spread of the coronavirus variant with the D614G mutation, which is the predominant lineage infecting North America and European populations.This variant spread so rapidly that in just 10 weeks between February and March 2020 over 64.11 per cent of globally infected individuals were identified to carry the mutant virus starting from only 1.95 per cent in January.However, the researchers, including those from the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG) in Kalyani, West Bengal, said this subtype took a significantly longer time to reach a 50 per cent relative frequency in East Asia—5.5 months—compared to the 2.15 months it took in Europe, and the 2.83 months it took in North-America.According to the scientists, a deficiency of the protein Alpha-anti-trypsin (AAT) across the populations of Europe and North-America is one of the main factors that explain the rapid spread of this variant in the two continents compared to its transmission in Asia.“For the coronavirus to enter cells, its spike protein binds with the ACE2 receptor in human cells, and the human enzyme TMPRSS2 cleaves at the junction of two subunits S1 and S2 of the protein, enabling the virus to fuse with the cell,” said study corresponding author Nidhan K Biswas from NIBMG.“But due to the D614G mutation in the spike protein, the virus gained an additional cleavage site which enables it to fuse better with cells,” Biswas told PTI.In lineages of the coronavirus carrying the D614G mutation, the 614th molecule of the virus spike protein—aspartic acid—denoted by D is replaced by the molecule glycine, noted as G.“Instead of one cleavage site, the mutated virus has two such sites, and it can take dual advantage of this and enter cells more easily,” Biswas explained.Based on the current study, he said this site in the virus is cleaved by the host protein neutrophil elastase which is normally involved in clearing up bacterial infections in the lungs.The levels of the elastase molecules in the body are naturally kept in check by AAT whose main function is to protect the lungs from inflammation and tissue damage, the study noted.“The issue is that if we have high neutrophil elastase then it also creates more damage to the lung cells. So there is a balance mechanism via the AAT enzyme that already exists by nature in everyone’s lungs,” Biswas explained.According to the study, AAT deficiency is highly prevalent in European and North-American populations, but much less in East Asia.Specifically, Biswas said AAT deficiency in the general population is very high in Italy and Spain.He explained that the lack of this protein makes it much easier for the neutrophil elastase molecule to act on the virus spike subunits, resulting in a significantly faster spread of this mutant.“The issue is that individuals with AAT deficiencies have high neutrophil levels and if they are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus with the D614G mutation, their cells can quickly take the virus up and into the whole system,” the NIGMB scientist explained.The researchers believe this finding, along with other social factors may explain the differential geographical/ethnic spread of 614G.While the findings offer clues about the transmission of the virus variant, Biswas cautioned against any interpretations of the study on disease severity and mortality caused by the strain.He said the research also provides some clues on the spread of other variants of the coronavirus such as the ones first reported in the UK and South Africa which are “built on the backbone of the D614G mutation.”      “The UK and South African variants also have this mutation backbone, so they may have a similar transmissibility pattern, and probably they may have additional capabilities that scientists need to find out,” Biswas added.However, he said further experimental studies on lab-cultured cells are needed to validate these conclusions.The scientists believe the findings open up the possibility for considerations of AAT supplements in the prevention of infection with the D614G subtype SARS-CoV-2 virus. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/protein-behind-less-spread-of-coronavirus-variant-in-asia-than-europe-north-america-study-210033
09-02-2021||New Delhi||UPSC civil service: Not in favour of granting relaxation in age limit, Centre tells SC||The Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that it is against granting one-time relaxation on age limit to UPSC civil service aspirants, including those who had exhausted their last attempt in 2020 exam amid the COVID-19 pandemic and would get one more chance this year provided they are not age barred, as it would be discriminatory to other candidates.The Centre told this to a Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar which reserved its verdict on a plea which had sought one more chance in the UPSC’s civil services exam to those aspirants who could not appear in their last attempt in 2020 due to the pandemic.Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, appearing for the Centre, said that initially the government was not willing to concede the extra chance and it was later done at the suggestion of the Bench.“This is not the exam where you prepare at the last minute. People prepare for years together,” Raju told the Bench, adding, “My first offer remains”.The Centre had on February 5 told the apex court that it was agreeable to give an extra chance as a one-time relaxation to those civil service aspirants, who had appeared in their last attempt in the 2020 exam and are otherwise not age-barred.It, however, had said that no relaxation shall be granted for 2021 exam to those candidates who have not exhausted their permissible number of attempts or to those who are otherwise age-barred from appearing in 2021 exam as per the prescribed age limits of different categories, or to any other candidate for any other reason whatsoever.The counsel appearing for the petitioners had on Monday argued that there should be one-time relaxation on age limit for the aspirants.On February 5, the Centre had filed a note in the apex court which said, “Relaxation, only to the extent of providing one extra attempt for Civil Service Examination (CSE), specifically limited to CSE-2021, may be granted to only those candidates who appeared for CSE-2020 as their last permissible attempt and are otherwise not age-barred from appearing in CSE-2021.” “This relaxation for the candidates and to the extent as prescribed above, shall be a one-time relaxation only and shall apply only for appearing in CSE-2021 and shall not be treated as a precedent,” it had said.“As per the suggestion of this court, the Union of India is agreeable for the following ex-gratia, one-time, restricted relaxation to be granted to the prospective candidates, subject to the same being part of a consent order, disposing off the petition,” the note had said.On February 1, the Centre had told the top court that it cannot grant an extra chance to civil services aspirants who could not appear or prepare well for their last attempt in the UPSC civil service exam in 2020 due to the pandemic, while reiterating that it would amount to extending “differential treatment” to similarly placed candidates.The Centre had earlier furnished a chart in the apex court giving details of relaxation given by Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) in civil services exams since its inception and had said that in 1979, 1992 and 2015 relaxations were given to the candidates due to change in patterns of examination.The top court on September 30 last year had refused to postpone the UPSC civil services preliminary exam because of the COVID-19 pandemic and floods in several parts of the country.However, it had directed the Central government and the UPSC to consider granting an extra chance to candidates who have their last attempt in 2020, with corresponding extension of the upper age-limit. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/upsc-civil-service-not-in-favour-of-granting-relaxation-in-age-limit-centre-tells-sc-210031

09-02-2021||New Delhi||India to overtake European Union as world’s third largest energy consumer by 2030: IEA||India will overtake the European Union as the world’s third-largest energy consumer by 2030, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday as it forecast India accounting for the biggest share of energy demand growth over the next two decades.In its India Energy Outlook 2021, IEA saw primary energy consumption almost doubling to 1,123 million tonnes of oil equivalent as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expands to USD 8.6 trillion by 2040.India at present is the fourth-largest global energy consumer behind China, the United States and the European Union.Underpinned by “a rate of GDP growth that adds the equivalent of another Japan to the world economy by 2040”, India will overtake the European Union by 2030 to move up to the third position, it said in the report.India accounts for nearly one-quarter of global energy demand growth from 2019-40—the largest for any country. Its share in the growth in renewable energy is the second-largest in the world, after China, IEA said.“By 2040, India’s power system is bigger than that of the European Union, and is the world’s third-largest in terms of electricity generation; it also has 30 per cent more installed renewables capacity than the United States,” it said.A five-fold increase in per capita car ownership will result in India leading the oil demand growth in the world. Also, it will become the fastest-growing market for natural gas, with demand more than tripling by 2040.“India’s continued industrialisation becomes a major driving force for the global energy economy. Over the last three decades, India accounted for about 10 per cent of world growth in industrial value-added (in PPP terms),” the report said.By 2040, India is set to account for almost 20 per cent of global growth in industrial value-added, and to lead global growth in industrial final energy consumption, especially in steelmaking. The nation accounts for nearly one-third of global industrial energy demand growth to 2040.India’s oil demand is seen rising by rise by 74 per cent to 8.7 million barrels per day by 2040 under the existing policies scenario. The natural gas requirement is projected to more than triple to 201 billion cubic meters and coal demand is seen rising to 772 million tonnes in 2040 from the current 590.To meet its energy needs, India will be more reliant on fossil fuel imports as its domestic oil and gas production stagnates.Its net dependence on oil imports—taking into account both the import of crude oil and the export of oil products—increases to more than 90 per cent by 2040 from the current 75 per cent as domestic consumption rises much more than production, the report said.Natural gas import dependency increased from 20 per cent in 2010 to almost 50 per cent in 2019 and is set to grow further to more than 60 per cent in 2040.“The dynamics look quite different for coal, where India’s demand for imported coal barely gets back to pre-crisis levels over the next decade,” IEA said.India currently accounts for 16 per cent of the global coal trade and many global coal suppliers were counting on growth in India to underpin planned export-oriented mining investments.“These expectations are now running up against India’s determination to boost domestic production, leaving relative certainty only over India’s requirement to import coking coal for its rising steel production, together with steam coal for those coastal power generation plants that have been designed to receive imported grades,” it said.IEA has forecast the combined import bill for fossil fuels tripling over the next two decades.“Energy use (in India) has doubled since 2000, with 80 per cent of demand still being met by coal, oil and solid biomass,” it said.On a per-capita basis, India’s energy use and emissions are less than half the world average, as are other key indicators such as vehicle ownership, steel and cement output.“As India recovers from a COVID-induced slump in 2020, it is re-entering a very dynamic period in its energy development. Over the coming years, millions of Indian households are set to buy new appliances, air conditioning units and vehicles,” it said.India will soon become the world’s most populous country, adding the equivalent of a city the size of Los Angeles to its urban population each year.“To meet growth in electricity demand over the next twenty years, India will need to add a power system the size of the European Union to what it has now,” it said.Prior to the global pandemic, India’s energy demand was projected to increase by almost 50 per cent between 2019 and 2030, but growth over this period is now closer to 35 per cent.“An expanding economy, population, urbanisation and industrialisation mean that India sees the largest increase in energy demand of any country,” IEA said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-overtake-european-union-as-worlds-third-largest-energy-consumer-by-2030-iea-210008
09-02-2021||Mandsaur||2 booked under MP’s new anti-conversion law, 1 nabbed from Uttar Pradesh||Madhya Pradesh Police have registered a case against two men under the state’s new law which penalises religious conversions through fraudulent means, an official said on Tuesday.The accused allegedly used fake names to lure two minor girls from Mandsaur in MP on the pretext of marriage, raped them and asked them to convert their religion, he said.One of the accused was arrested last week from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, the police said.A 16-year-old girl initially became friends with one of the accused after she received a call from an unknown number on her mobile phone, Suwasra police station’s sub- inspector Ritesh Damor said.Later, she persuaded her 15-year-old friend living in the neighbourhood to run away from home with her.Both the girls left their homes on February 1 following which their parents filed a missing complaint at Suwasra police station, the official said.While searching for them, a team from Suwasra police station reached Delhi and got some clues about the location of the girls.The police team subsequently traced the girls to a room at Chandpur village in UP’s Bijnor district last week, the official said.During questioning, the 16-year-old girl said she befriended a man, who had identified himself as Akash, after receiving a call from him about months back, Damor said.Later, theman called the girl and her friend to come to Bijnor on the pretext of marriage.The girls were allegedly raped and detained by the man and his friend, he said.The official said the girls also alleged that they were told to convert their religion for marriage.The girls also said they later found that Akash’s real name was Irfan, he said.During the police raid in Bijnor last week, Irfan fled while his friend and co-accused Sahil (19) was arrested, the official said.A case has been registered against both the accused under sections for rape and abduction and provisions of the new anti-conversion law, he said.The Madhya Pradesh government last month promulgated the Freedom of Religion- 2020 ordinance which penalises religious conversions by use of misrepresentation, allurement, use of threat of force, undue influence, coercion or marriage or by any other fraudulent means.It provides for 10 years in jail in some cases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-booked-under-mps-new-anti-conversion-law-1-nabbed-from-uttar-pradesh-210006
09-02-2021||Satya Prakash||SC issues notice to Centre on PIL seeking transfer of cases on definition of ‘minority’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 9The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued a notice to the Centre on a PIL seeking transfer of all petitions pending in various high courts challenging the validity of Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992, to avoid multiplicity of litigation and conflicting interpretations.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde asked the Centre and petitioners before various high courts to respond to the transfer petition filed by Delhi BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay.He wanted the top court to hear all cases on the issue to avoid the multiplicity of litigation and conflicting views on the interpretation of Articles 29 and 30 of the Constitution that deal with the protection of interests of minorities, and the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions.Currently, various high courts, including Delhi, Guwahati and Meghalaya, were seized of petitions challenging the validity of Section 2(c) of the NCM Act, 1992.Section 2(c) simply says “minority”, for the purposes of this Act, means a community notified as such by the Central Government.The Centre issued a notification on October 23, 1993, declaring Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis and Buddhists as minorities. Jains were added to the list in 2014 based on their demographic numbers.However, the Act doesn’t lay down any guidelines for determination of claim of any religious or linguistic group to be declared as “minority” under the NCM Act, and the Centre has identified “minorities” on the national basis and not on the basis of a community’s number in a particular state. It has led to an anomalous situation as in many states a community having a higher population has been declared as “minority”, he said.Upadhyay said: “The minority rights of the Hindus are being siphoned off illegally and arbitrarily to the majority population because neither the Centre nor respective states have notified them as ‘minority’ under Section 2(c) of the NCM Act. Hence, Hindus are being deprived of their basic rights and protections guaranteed under Articles 29-30.”Describing the Supreme Court as custodian of the Constitution and protector of Fundamental Rights, Upadhyay urged it to direct the Ministry of Home Affairs to identify and notify religious and linguistic minorities at the state level in the spirit of the Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-pil-seeking-transfer-of-cases-on-definition-of-minority-210005
09-02-2021||New Delhi||Himalayan glaciers sensitive to climate change, rapidly shrinking||Himalayan glaciers are highly sensitive to climate change and are rapidly shrinking, posing a big threat to the populations that rely on them, according to scientific explanations.Besides the ecosystem services that the glaciers provide, their melting increases the risk of runoffs and floods as recently seen with the Uttarakhand glacier disaster that claimed 26 lives and 197 persons still reported missing with rescue operations underway.The science behind what is currently happening in the Himalayas was forecasted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its 2019 report that say glaciers would retreat in the upcoming years, causing landslides and floods.Himalayan glaciers play an important role in South Asia, providing drinking water and water resources for agriculture, hydropower and biodiversity.Glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region are a crucial water supply for the 240 million people who live in the region, including 86 million Indians, roughly the equivalent of the country's five biggest cities combined.Another comprehensive report two years ago, the Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment, coordinated by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) notes that eastern Himalaya glaciers have tended to shrink faster than those in central and western Himalaya."While there is still some confusion as to what exactly caused the flood in Uttarakhand, we are working closely with our partners on the ground to understand what happened in this particular instance," ICIMOD Director General Pema Gyamtsho said.ICIMOD develops and shares research, information and innovations to empower people in the eight regional member countries of the Hindu Kush Himalaya region -- Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan.Sounding an alarm, a 2019 discussion paper by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) notes the warming rate over the Himalayan region is projected to increase in the range of 0.5 degree to one degree Celsius by 2020s and one to three degrees by mid-century.However, the warming rate is not uniform either spatially or temporally, it says.However, a 2017 study published in 'Nature' warns that even if global temperature is kept below 1.5 degrees, around 35 per cent of the ice mass stored in the high mountains of Asia will be lost.It says that number could increase up to 65 per cent in a scenario of high greenhouse gas emissions.Describing the Himalayas a water tower, Jawaharlal Nehru University's School of Environmental Science Professor A P Dimri said with increasing global warming, the upper reaches of the Himalayas are warming faster, leading to more rapid melting of the glaciers."This has resulted in an increasing number of glacier lakes, which are formed by water melting from the ice caps and accumulating at the mouth or snout of the glacier. These lakes also become reservoirs of ice and moraine debris. With an increase in this phenomenon, the breach of glacier lakes poses a severe threat to the communities living downstream." With the Himalayan states prone to flash floods and landslides, this disaster prompted calls by scientists and experts for a review of hydropower projects in the ecologically sensitive mountains.This deadly flood hit two hydroelectric dams, claiming most of the victims were workers on the power projects.Centre for Policy Research Senior Fellow Manju Menon said: "One of the most unfortunate outcomes of the climate policy discourses globally has been a reacceptance of large dams by governments as a viable non-fossil fuel source of energy."In India we had reached a point when massive social and environmental mobilisations on large dams underlined how these structures waste water instead of conserving it and offering false developmental solutions. This reacceptance is ironic because climate change has also made hydrological flows in the Himalayas erratic and unpredictable, in terms of the impacts on glaciers and monsoon patterns."Therefore, planning and implementing large engineering projects on Himalayan rivers is fraught with great risks. Most scholars of Himalayan rivers have been warning about these risks for decades, but the environment impact assessment for these projects withhold or underplay this information so that projects get approved."An analysis by the UN University (UNU) said by 2050 most people on earth will live downstream of tens of thousands of large dams built in the 20th century, many of them already operating at or beyond their design life, putting lives and property at risk.The report, "Ageing water infrastructure: An emerging global risk", by the UNU's Canadian-based Institute for Water, Environment and Health, released last month said most of the 58,700 large dams worldwide were constructed between 1930 and 1970 with a design life of 50 to 100 years, adding that at 50 years, a large concrete dam "would most probably begin to express signs of ageing".It says the climate change will accelerate the dam ageing process.

Rescuers had deployed sniffer dogs to reach out to the trapped persons."Our initial target was to clear debris from 180 metres from the tunnel's mouth, from where there is a bend to the right side where over 30 persons are feared stuck. These people were riding a vehicle when flash flood hit the project," ITBP Spokesperson Vivek Pandey told IANS.Earlier, report had quoted police as saying that a 140-metre stretch had been cleared of debris.More than 200 ITBP personnel had reached the spot soon after a glacial mudflow on Sunday morning triggered a massive flash flood at Joshimath in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district, hitting NTPC's Tapovan and Rishiganga hydro projects."Around 170 persons are still feared missing. There is information about recovery of 30 bodies from different locations. Three bodies were recovered from Reni village on Tuesday morning," Pandey said.Earlier, state authorities were quoted as saying on Monday evening that 197 persons were still missing whereas 26 bodies had been recovered.The NDRF, ITBP and state authorities are involved in search and rescue operation along with the Army. The Centre is monitoring the situation.One column of Engineering Task Force (ETF) of the Army along with rescue equipment were deployed in the area. The Army men along with ETF personnel opened the tunnel mouth at Tapovan. Besides, a team of scientists flown to Dehradun on Sunday night also visited the spot.Rough terrain, low temperature and debris in the tunnel are posing a major challenge for rescuers.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rough-terrain-low-temperature-debris-in-tunnel-major-challenge-for-rescuers-209999

It is implemented along with states.The JJM seeks to provide every rural household in the country high-quality and regular piped water on a sustainable basis by 2024.NJJM's Mission Director Bharat Lal, who is also Additional Secretary, Jal Shakti, gave a broad indication that the putative devices should be available sometime in the coming fiscal year.He said the Ministry will be just a facilitator concerning the devices. It would be upon the state and local authorities to procure them and carry forward the matter.Also, the Ministry will encourage the Gram Panchayats, local authorities and the States concerned to levy user charge/service charge on the consumers concerning the tap water provided under JJM.Lal said the administrative decision on levying the user charge would be purely that of the local authorities and their States concerned.Water is a State subject.Briefing about the allocation of funds for Jal Shakti Ministry in the Union Budget 2021-22, Kumar along with top officers exuded optimism.The budget outlay for the Department of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation has been increased to Rs 9,022 crore from Rs 7,262 crore (RE) in 2020-21. Also, Rs 5,130 crore to be provided through EBR route for critical irrigation projects. The total allocation is Rs 14,152 crore.The Micro Irrigation corpus has been doubled to Rs 10,000 crore.The allocations include Rs 330 crore for Atal Bhujal Yojana. The scheme is being implemented in seven states, including Haryana, and involving a total of 78 districts and 8,350 Gram Panchayats.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jal-shakti-ministry-to-provide-portable-water-devices-to-ensure-quality-of-drinking-water-209996
09-02-2021||Chennai||Sasikala reaches Chennai after 23 hour road trip from Bengaluru||Expelled AIADMK leader VK Sasikala on Tuesday arrived here, 23 hours after her departure from Bengaluru, where she had served a four-year jail term in a corruption case and also underwent treatment for COVID-19.The 65-year-old former confidante of late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa arrived at T Nagar around 7 am on Tuesday.Her nephew and Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) leader TTV Dhinakaran, who indicated Sasikala might contest elections, said his efforts to “retrieve” the AIADMK will continue and asserted that the aim was to ensure that DMK did not come to power in the coming Assembly polls in the state.Top actor Rajinikanth had enquired about Sasikala’s health with him on Monday, he told reporters here.Earlier, Sasikala had left the Karnataka capital by car on Monday morning and was accorded a grand reception by her supporters all along the way, till she reached the city this morning.Before reaching home, she visited the residence of AIADMK founder and late Chief Minister M G Ramachandran at Ramapuram here and paid floral tributes to his portrait and garlanded a statue of the popular leader installed there.She was accompanied by Dhinakaran.Sasikala earlier underwent her sentence in the Rs 66.65 crore disproportionate assets case at the Parapana Agrahara central prison in Bengaluru since February 2017 and was set free on January 27.However, she remained at the Government Victoria hospital, where she had been admitted after testing positive for COVID-19 while under judicial custody.She was discharged from the hospital on January 31 after which she stayed at a resort, about 35 km from Bengaluru.Meanwhile, Dhinakaran told reporters that all efforts to ‘retrieve’ the AIADMK will continue.Further, “we are strong (determined) that DMK should not come to power and will take all efforts in this direction,” he said.Asked if AMMK and AIADMK would join hands to keep the DMK at bay, Dhinakaran said, “as far as I am concerned, AMMK was started in March 2018 to retrieve AIADMK and give Amma’s rule.”“I have been saying this ever since. Our aim is to retrieve the AIADMK and when that will happen is in people’s hands. I am confident that will happen,” he added.He also questioned DMK chief M K Stalin’s assertion that a fresh probe by an enquiry commission will be launched into the death of Jayalalithaa if the party comes to power, and quoted a Tamil saying to suggest it was not a genuine concern.He also charged the DMK with making baseless allegations against Sasikala on this issue.The AMMK leader said Stalin had raked up the matter during the 2017 RK Nagar by-poll, which Dhinakaran won, following the death of Jayalalithaa who then represented the city segment in the Assembly.To a question, he said his aunt Sasikala may contest elections, though she may have served a prison term in a corruption case.“There is time. She may not be able to contest under the present conditions but there are options available in the law... can approach court successfully,” he added.He was a “positive thinker” and therefore he believes Sasikala could face the polls, Dhinakaran said.He also declined to respond to a question if the BJP was involved in a possible AIADMK and AMMK tie-up, saying it was ‘speculation.’Pointing out at Sasikala’s court case against her expulsion by the AIADMK led by O Panneerselvam and K Palaniswami, he said she will continue with her “legal struggle.”He recalled when Jayalalithaa was the party General Secretary, she had all the authority in the top post to summon General Council and make appointments and claimed nobody else could do so.After Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, Sasikala was elected interim general secretary of the AIADMK and also its Legislature Party Leader later, paving the way for her elevation as chief minister, but she had to serve the jail term after the Supreme Court restored the lower court award.The AIADMK suffered a split with Panneerselvam, now deputy chief minister, and chief minister Palaniswami heading two factions, but they later merged the groups and the general counsel of the combined party expelled Sasikala in September 2017 along with Dhinakaran and others.Asked if his aunt would ‘summon’ the General Council of the AIADMK now, Dhinakaran said only she can answer that.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sasikala-reaches-chennai-after-23-hour-road-trip-from-bengaluru-209991
09-02-2021||New Delhi||SC grants protection to AAP leader Sanjay Singh in 'hate speech' cases in UP||The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted protection from coercive action to Aam Aadmi Party leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh in alleged hate speech cases lodged against him in Uttar Pradesh.However, the court said that UP Police are not precluded from seeking sanction to prosecute him from Rajya Sabha Chairperson in the cases.              The top court also issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government and sought its response on two pleas of Singh seeking clubbing and quashing of FIRs lodged against him after his press conference on August 12 last year at which he alleged that the state government was favouring a certain class of society.During the hearing, a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R S Reddy told the counsels for Singh that he cannot divide the society on lines of castes and religion.Senior advocate Vivek Tankha and advocate Sumeer Sodhi, appearing for Singh, said that no procedures were followed by the police in lodging the case and sanction to prosecute the Rajya Sabha MP was not taken. The bench said that it will not get into the sanction aspect at this moment but it does not mean that no offence has been made out against Singh. It told Tankha that the court understands that sanction to prosecute under section 197 CrPC ought to have been taken from chairperson of Rajya Sabha.On February 2, the top court had refused to grant protection to Singh against whom a non-bailable warrant (NBW) has been issued on an FIR lodged in Lucknow. The AAP leader has moved the apex court seeking quashing of multiple FIRs lodged against him in various districts of Uttar Pradesh after the press conference, saying they have been “maliciously instituted to unleash political vendetta”.In a separate petition, Singh has also challenged the January 21 order of the Allahabad High Court which refused to quash the FIR in Lucknow.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-grants-protection-to-aap-leader-sanjay-singh-in-hate-speech-cases-in-up-209985

It's a loss for all of us at Twitter, but after more than five years in the role we respect her desire to focus on the most important people and relationships in her personal life,” Twitter Vice President Public Policy Monique Meche said.Meche said Kaul would continue in her role till the end of March and would support the transition.In an emailed response, a Twitter spokesperson said the company reviews every report it receives from the government as expeditiously as possible.It will “take appropriate action regarding such reports while making sure we hold firm to our fundamental values and commitment to protecting the public conversation. An update is shared through our established channels of communication with the Government,” the spokesperson said.The spokesperson emphasised that the company strongly believes that the open and free exchange of information has a positive global impact, and that the tweets must continue to flow.

09-02-2021||New Delhi||Himalayan glaciers sensitive to climate change, rapidly shrinking: Explained||Himalayan glaciers are highly sensitive to climate change and are rapidly shrinking, posing a big threat to the populations that rely on them, according to scientific explanations.Besides the ecosystem services that the glaciers provide, their melting increases the risk of runoffs and floods as recently seen with the Uttarakhand glacier disaster that claimed 26 lives and 197 people still reported missing with rescue operations underway.The science behind what is currently happening in the Himalayas was forecasted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its 2019 report that say glaciers would retreat in the upcoming years, causing landslides and floods.Himalayan glaciers play an important role in South Asia, providing drinking water and water resources for agriculture, hydropower and biodiversity.Glaciers in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region are a crucial water supply for the 240 million people who live in the region, including 86 million Indians, roughly the equivalent of the country's five biggest cities combined.Another comprehensive report two years ago, the Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment, coordinated by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) notes that eastern Himalaya glaciers have tended to shrink faster than those in central and western Himalaya."While there is still some confusion as to what exactly caused the flood in Uttarakhand, we are working closely with our partners on the ground to understand what happened in this particular instance," ICIMOD Director General Pema Gyamtsho said on Monday.ICIMOD develops and shares research, information and innovations to empower people in the eight regional member countries of the Hindu Kush Himalaya region -- Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan.Sounding an alarm, a 2019 discussion paper by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) notes the warming rate over the Himalayan region is projected to increase in the range of 0.5 degree to one degree Celsius by 2020s and one to three degrees by mid-century.However, the warming rate is not uniform either spatially or temporally, it says.However, a 2017 study published in Nature warns that even if global temperature is kept below 1.5 degrees, around 35 per cent of the ice mass stored in the high mountains of Asia will be lost.It says that number could increase up to 65 per cent in a scenario of high greenhouse gas emissions.Describing the Himalayas a water tower, Jawaharlal Nehru University's School of Environmental Science Professor A.P. Dimri said with increasing global warming, the upper reaches of the Himalayas are warming faster, leading to more rapid melting of the glaciers."This has resulted in an increasing number of glacier lakes, which are formed by water melting from the ice caps and accumulating at the mouth or snout of the glacier. These lakes also become reservoirs of ice and moraine debris. With an increase in this phenomenon, the breach of glacier lakes poses a severe threat to the communities living downstream." With the Himalayan states prone to flash floods and landslides, this disaster prompted calls by scientists and experts for a review of hydropower projects in the ecologically sensitive mountains.This deadly flood hit two hydroelectric dams, claiming most of the victims were workers on the power projects.Centre for Policy Research Senior Fellow Manju Menon said: "One of the most unfortunate outcomes of the climate policy discourses globally has been a reacceptance of large dams by governments as a viable non-fossil fuel source of energy."In India we had reached a point when massive social and environmental mobilisations on large dams underlined how these structures waste water instead of conserving it and offering false developmental solutions. This reacceptance is ironic because climate change has also made hydrological flows in the Himalayas erratic and unpredictable, in terms of the impacts on glaciers and monsoon patterns."Therefore, planning and implementing large engineering projects on Himalayan rivers is fraught with great risks. Most scholars of Himalayan rivers have been warning about these risks for decades, but the environment impact assessment for these projects withhold or underplay this information so that projects get approved." An analysis by the UN University (UNU) said by 2050 most people on earth will live downstream of tens of thousands of large dams built in the 20th century, many of them already operating at or beyond their design life, putting lives and property at risk.The report, "Ageing water infrastructure: An emerging global risk", by the UNU's Canadian-based Institute for Water, Environment and Health, released last month said most  of the 58,700 large dams worldwide were constructed between 1930 and 1970 with a design life of 50 to 100 years, adding that at 50 years, a large concrete dam "would most probably begin to express signs of ageing".It says the climate change will accelerate the dam ageing process.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/himalayan-glaciers-sensitive-to-climate-change-rapidly-shrinking-explained-209980

He used to make videos and send it to her, and she used to upload them on his Facebook account,” a police source said.Sidhu kept changing his locations to evade arrest, sources said, adding that several teams are working to arrest other persons who were involved in the violence.Sidhu was sent to seven-day police custody by Metropolitan Magistrate Prigya Gupta.However, Sidhu’s counsel claimed that he had nothing to do with the violence and was at the wrong place at the wrong time.The violence took place when tens of thousands of farmers broke barriers to storm the national capital on January 26 during their tractor parade to highlight their demand for repealing the new agri laws.However, their parade dissolved into unprecedented scenes of anarchy as they fought with police, overturned vehicles and delivered a national insult hoisting a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort, a privilege reserved for India’s tricolour.Thousands of protesting farmers who reached ITO from the Ghazipur border clashed with police. Many of them driving tractors reached the Red Fort and entered the monument, where the religious flag was also hoisted. Over 500 police personnel were injured and one protesters died.At the Red Fort on January 26, several police personnel had fell or jumped tens of feet down a wall after being pushed to the edge by a marauding mob.In the FIR registered in connection with the Red Fort violence, police said two magazines with 20 live cartridges were snatched from two constables by protesters who also damaged vehicles and robbed anti-riot gear.“The mob later hoisted different flags there. They also started creating nuisance on the rampart. The unruly mob was asked to come downstairs. They went to Meena Bazar area to enter the into Red Fort. When the police tried to take them out of Lahore Gate, the mob became violent and attacked personnel. The mob thrashed the police personnel and threw them in the wells,” police had said in the FIR.“They damaged a bus, a government gypsy and other vehicles. The mob robbed the anti-riots gears—cane stick, shields, body protectors, helmets etc from the police personnel,” it had also said.

Language used by some for them and bid to mislead them will never benefit the nation,” PM Modi said.Amendments rejectedCong’s Deepender Hooda moved two amendments to the motion thanking President’s Address —repeal of farm laws & obituary reference to farmers who have died during the stir. Both were rejected.Tikait: He is trying to confuse the peopleWe never said anything about MSP getting withdrawn. It is an attempt to confuse people. Our demand is that the govt brings a law on MSP with a guarantee on procurement. — Rakesh Tikait, BKU“If there is any drawback in the laws, it will be corrected. If there is a loose end, it will be tightened. Our doors are open for suggestions,” the PM said. Replying to a discussion in the Rajya Sabha on a motion thanking the President for his address to Parliament at the start of the Budget session, Modi asserted that the system of minimum support price (MSP) for crops would continue. “The MSP was there, is there and is going to be there in future,” Modi said, adding that mandis would be modernised and there was also no question of abolition of distribution of ration through the PDS. Modi appealed to the farmers protesting on the outskirts of Delhi to return home. “It does not feel right… there are old people too in the gathering.”He also urged the MPs to request the agitating farmers to leave. “If the laws produce an adverse impact, pass the blame to me. If the laws work, take all the credit,” the PM told the Opposition, seeking its cooperation.Modi said the idea of a “one large common market” for agricultural produce was also envisaged by former PM Manmohan Singh, “who had said the existing marketing regime prevented farmers from getting the highest rate of return”.“It is our endeavour to remove all those handicaps that are in the way of India realising its vast potential as one large common market,” Modi said, quoting Manmohan Singh.In an apparent reference to tweets by pop star Rihanna and Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg favouring the agitating farmers, Modi played on the term FDI to warn against damaging influences from abroad.“We have to protect the nation from this new FDI —- foreign destructive ideology,” he said.He also hit out at “a new crop of agitators”. “There is a new crop of ‘andolan-jivi’. They look for ways to start a new movement. The country needs to be wary of these andolan-jivi,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/give-agri-laws-a-chance-modi-209819
09-02-2021||Mukesh Ranjan||26 bodies recovered, 171 still missing in Uttarakhand||Tribune News ServiceJoshimath, February 8Twentysix bodies have been recovered while 171 persons were still missing as a multi-agency rescue operation was underway at the NTPC hydel project site in Chamoli that was ravaged by a flashflood in the Rishi Ganga, possibly after a portion of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off on Sunday.Edit: Himalayan tragedyReady to help in relief operation: United NationThe United Nations stands ready to contribute to the ongoing rescue and assistance efforts in Uttarakhand, if necessary, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said as the global organisation expressed sadness over the loss of life and damage due to the glacier burst and flooding. PTIRockfall likely trigger: ExpertKalachand Sain, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, says rockfall on accumulated snow in the higher Himalayan reaches of Chamoli may have caused a glacial breach. He pointed out that of the 1,000 glaciers in U’khand, scientists are able to monitor only 7. The glacier burst appeared to have triggered an avalanche and a deluge that ripped through the Alaknanda river system — the Rishi Ganga is its part.The 171 reported missing, mostly from Uttarakhand, UP and Bihar, include those working at hydel power project sites and villagers whose homes nearby were washed away with the force of the raging waters, officials said. Two power projects — NTPC’s 480-MW Tapovan-Vishnugad project and the 13.2-MW Rishiganga hydel project —were extensively damaged with scores of labourers caught in tunnels as the waters came gushing in. Thirteen villages are cut off.The disaster management teams were working to rescue 30 to 35 workers learnt to be stuck inside the Tapovan tunnel, said officials. Sniffer dogs and heavy mechanical equipment, including bulldozers and JCBs, were deployed.Officials said 27 persons were rescued alive. Of them, 12 were saved from the smaller of the two tunnels at the Tapovan-Vishnugad project site and 15 from the Rishi Ganga site.Facing criticism for allowing hydel projects in an ecologically fragile landscape, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat cautioned against falling for anti-development agenda in the wake of the flashflood.The CM, who arrived in Joshimath, was briefed by ITBP Additional Director General (Western Command) MS Rawat about the rescue work.The ITBP ADG, who met an ISRO team at the site, said the cause of the flashflood was being investigated, though it appeared lakhs of metric tonnes of snow had slid off a hill into the feeding points of the rivers.Trivendra Singh said once the probe report was out, they would draft a plan to ward off potential disasters.The residents of the 13 villages that have been cut off have been demanding rehabilitation elsewhere, saying they were scared to live here anymore. There’s apprehension that the flashflood swept away the supervisors of the projects in the Chamoli region.The agencies involved in the rescue efforts include ITBP, Army, National Disaster Response Force and the State Disaster Response Force.NDRF chief SN Pradhan tweeted today that more teams had been flown in to Joshimath. An official said the operation to rescue the labourers feared trapped inside the tunnel remained slow due to structural challenges posed.ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey said special equipment had been arranged for the rescue. “There is a huge amount of debris inside the 250-metre tunnel. A 100-metre portion has been cleared,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/26-bodies-recovered-171-still-missing-in-uttarakhand-209820

In shock, the rescued workers recount their brush with death and how they held on to life trapped in a slush-filled tunnel for over five hours on Sunday until ITBP teams arrived and pulled them out using ropes. “I was working in the tunnel when alarm bells suddenly went off.Within seconds, there was frenzied commotion. All were shouting ‘bhago paani ka sailaab aa raha hai’ (save yourself from the deluge). I felt numb for a second, but mustered courage to run—albeit in the direction of water.“The last thing I remember was getting stuck in slush until I was pulled out. Those six hours were the darkest in my life,” says Himachal Pradesh’s Satish Kumar, 31, among the first few to be rescued.Andhra Pradesh’s KS Reddy, an electrician, says it’s surreal to be alive. “I normally don’t work in the tunnel but yesterday around 9.30 am, I went in to fix some lights. Around 10.15 am, water gushed inside, sweeping along several workers. The electrical wire I was carrying proved my saviour as I used it to anchor myself along the tunnel wall,” the 50-year-old recounts.Among the survivors are Nepali nationals Chitra, Kiran, Basant and Sant Bahadur, all in shock, speechless, barely able to fold hands in gratitude when asked, “Are you fine?”Uttar Pradesh’s Virendra Kumar, pulled out with ropes as machines could not work inside the tunnels, recalls, “I fell unconscious as the wall of water hit us. Don’t remember what happened next and regained consciousness only after reaching the hospital.”Four Chamoli residents—Lal Bahadur, Rakesh Bhatt, Suraj and Vinod Singh—too survived, courtesy ITBP personnel who proved to be a godsend amid the catastrophe.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-flashflood-survivors-recount-horror-209821

No praise is enough for the actions taken by the Army, BSF and other security forces in containing Pak-sponsored terrorist activities. — Rajnath Singh, Defence MinisterIn ’20, 46 killed in 5,133 ceasefire violations“The first five Rafale aircraft were formally inducted into the IAF on September 10. The arrangements for this event were made mostly through local resources of the IAF. The total expenditure on the event was Rs 41.32 lakh, including Rs 9.18 lakh of GST,” he added.The Defence Minister said traditionally all-new variant of aircraft were inducted into the IAF through a grand ceremony. The Rafale induction ceremony was attended by the French Defence Minister and top executives of the French aerospace major Dassault Aviation, the manufacturer of Rafale.The second batch of three Rafale jets arrived in India on November 3, while the third batch of three more jets joined the IAF on January 27. The Rafale are India’s first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 years after the Sukhoi jets were purchased from Russia.The first squadron of the Rafale jets is stationed at the Ambala airbase, while the second one will be based at the Hasimara IAF station in West Bengal. India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in 2016 to procure 36 Rafale fighters at a cost of Rs 59,000 crore.“India will have 17 Rafale jets by March this year and the entire fleet of the fighter aircraft bought by the country will reach by April 2022,” the Defence Minister added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rafale-induction-event-cost-govt-over-rs41-lakh-rajnath-209824

Out of 1,000 glaciers in Uttarakhand, scientists are able to physically monitor only sevenKalachand Sain, Director, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, a department of science facility, probing the cause behind the flood, said, “Satellite imagery has thrown early signs of a rockfall in the upper reaches, which may have caused the glacier to break and the water to come gushing downstream.”“We are yet to reach a conclusion on the exact cause behind the flooding. But based on observations from satellite images of the area, it appears that a rockfall, on snow-capped reaches, broke a glacier. The images reveal a massive scar – around half a kilometre in diameter — on the snow cover. Our teams have left for the site to match satellite evidence with field data. Unless that happens, nothing can be said definitively,” Sain told The Tribune today.The expert also said preliminary findings didn’t point to glacier lake outburst flood and appeared more consistent with an avalanche caused by rockfall on snow.“It had snowed in the region in the past weeks and accumulation of snow has happened,” Sain said, noting that conclusive findings will take over a week to emerge.Asked if such disasters could be predicted, Sain said yes. “Current capacities to monitor glaciers are very limited. Out of 1,000 glaciers in Uttarakhand, we are able to physically monitor only seven. We need automatic weather stations along upper reaches to improve data generation and a dedicated national institute to process that data for disaster forecast,” he added.Five scientists of Wadia institute today reached Joshi Math to investigate the flood but are yet to climb up the source of the disaster. “It is a very steep and hard to access region. We may need choppers to get aerial views,” Sain said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rockfall-triggered-breach-probe-on-209826

There were extraordinary circumstances,” a Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar told Additional Solicitor General SV Raju. The court’s comments came after senior counsel Shyam Divan submitted on behalf of the petitioner candidates that extra chance and age-bar relaxation were inter-twined and such last chance candidates should be treated as a “homogenous class”.Divan and other senior counsel representing the petitioners pointed out that such relaxation had been given in the past as well.“You can always argue it is a policy decision. But is there a way out? We are also of the view that age should not be changed. But if it is done in the past, is it possible as a one-time measure?” the Bench asked, noting that policies were made based on ground realities.The Bench deferred the hearing to Tuesday after ASG Raju said he would like to seek instructions. It said if the issue was not resolved tomorrow, it would proceed to decide the case on merits.The Centre and UPSC had on February 5 agreed to grant an extra chance to candidates who are not age-barred and exhausted their last attempt for the Civil Services Examination (CSE) in 2020 during the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-consider-extra-chance-to-age-barred-upsc-aspirants-too-209827
09-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||Glacier burst or an avalanche? Experts debate||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 8The Uttarakhand tragedy has put a question mark on what actually led to the disaster. While some environmentalists are questioning claims of “a glacier burst”, others are pointing to long-standing struggle of locals against massive construction activities, including highways and hydropower projects such as Rishi Ganga, in eco-sensitive zones “without proper clearance”.“Was it a glacial burst or an avalanche?” questioned Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People amid the revival of debate around infrastructure projects by those upset with the Centre and state clearances for massive infrastructure activities in fragile, eco-sensitive regions of the Himalayas.A former member of the Narendra Modi Cabinet, Uma Bharti adds it’s something she had warned against as a minister and that the tragedy is both a matter of concern and warning. “When I was the minister, my ministry, in its affidavit about dams in Uttarakhand, had requested that it is a sensitive region. Therefore, power projects should not be built on the Ganga and its main tributaries,” she said. While Bharti said electricity shortfall could have been met by the national grid, Thakkar added that wind and solar were better ways to generate power in mountains.There are around 98 dams in Uttarakhand. Besides, rapid infrastructure development of roads, highways, hotels is taking place in the state, leading to “virtual shake-up” of the “young” mountains. Activists have been cautioning about “weakening” of “young mountains” due to dynamite blasts and “manmade fires”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/glacier-burst-or-an-avalanche-experts-debate-209828

09-02-2021||Washington||Biden, Modi committed to working towards greater Indo-US ties||US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are committed to defeating the Covid, rebuilding the global economy, jointly combating the scourge of global terrorism and promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific, setting up an ambitious agenda to take the strategic bilateral ties to the next level.The two leaders, during their first phone call on Monday after Biden was sworn in as the US President, agreed to continue close cooperation to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, including support for freedom of navigation, territorial integrity and a stronger regional architecture through the Quad, the White House said.Biden and Modi committed that the US and India would work closely together to win the fight against the Covid pandemic, renew their partnership on climate change, rebuild the global economy in a way that benefits the people of both countries, and stand together against the scourge of global terrorism, the White House said in a readout of the call.Spoke to @POTUS @JoeBiden and conveyed my best wishes for his success. We discussed regional issues and our shared priorities. We also agreed to further our co-operation against climate change.  After being sworn in as President on January 20, Biden has so far had phone calls with nine foreign leaders. Traditionally, the new American President makes first phone calls to the leaders of two neighbouring countries — Canada and Mexico.Thereafter, Biden called leaders of close US allies, including Britain, France, Germany, South Korea and Australia. In between, he called Russian President Vladimir Putin, which was necessitated due to the extension of the New Start Treaty for another five years.Modi is the first foreign leader whom Biden has spoken with beyond neighbours and key NATO allies, reflecting the significance his administration attaches to ties with India.President @JoeBiden and I are committed to a rules-based international order. We look forward to consolidating our strategic partnership to further peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. @POTUS  “The President underscored his desire to defend democratic institutions and norms around the world and noted that a shared commitment to democratic values is the bedrock for the US-India relationship,” the White House said, adding the two leaders resolved that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld in Myanmar.Myanmar’s military last week toppled the government and seized power for one year, detaining top political figures, including de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi.The reference to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, including support for freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, is a clear reference to China’s aggressive actions in the region.China claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. It has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.China has impeded commercial activity such as fishing or mineral exploration by countries namely Vietnam and the Philippines.Biden and Modi agreed to stay in close touch on a range of global challenges and look forward to what the United States and India would achieve together for their people and for their nations, the White House said.In a tweet, Modi said he conveyed his best wishes to the US President and they discussed regional issues, as well as shared priorities.“We also agreed to further our cooperation against climate change,” he said.“President Biden & I are committed to a rules-based order. We look forward to consolidating our strategic partnership to further peace & security in Indo-Pacific region and beyond,” Modi said in another tweet.The two leaders had a very warm and wide-ranging conversation, India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, told PTI after the phone call between the two leaders.“We have an ambitious agenda for cooperation and you will see active engagement in the days ahead. Based on our shared values and common strategic interests, we are committed to advancing India-US Strategic Partnership and closely working together with like-minded countries in meeting regional and global challenges — COVID-19 pandemic, economic recovery, clean energy and climate change, fight against terrorism, cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and beyond,” Sandhu said.This was the second phone call between Biden and Modi after the November 3 presidential elections and the first one since Biden assumed office on January 20.The first one was on November 17 when they reiterated their firm commitment to bilateral strategic partnership and discussed shared priorities such as COVID-19, energy and climate change, and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, Sandhu said in an earlier interview last week.In recent days, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval have spoken to their US counterparts — Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and NSA Jake Sullivan, respectively.These conversations have been very warm and forward looking, according to the Indian envoy.Biden is known to be a strong proponent of closer India-US ties since his days as a senator in the 1970s and played a key role in getting the approval of the Senate for the bilateral civil nuclear deal in 2008.The strategic and defence ties between India and the US witnessed major expansion during Barack Obama’s presidency and Biden, as the vice president, had played a key role in it.

09-02-2021||New Delhi||Pro-Centre traders' body CAIT calls for Bharat Bandh on February 26||The staunchly pro-Modi government Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has called for a Bharat Trade Bandh on February 26 against the goods and services tax (GST), “one of the most complex taxation system which has resulted in misery to traders”.The CAIT has also claimed the support of All India Transport Welfare Association (AITWA) which will carry out a ‘chakka jam’ on the same day.“Repeated statements of CAIT were never responded by the GST Council, which has generated a feeling among the traders across the country that the council has its own agenda and it is not interested in obtaining cooperation of traders. We highly regret such dismal picture of GST and which has compelled the trade leaders attending the conference to call for a Bharat Trade Bandh,” said a statement.Besides the complicated tax structure, the traders’ ire is directed at the absence of a consultative mechanism both at centre and states which is “against the declared policy of PM Modi for taking stakeholders into confidence while framing a policy or the rules and minimum government-maximum governance”, it said in a statement.CAIT national president BC Bhartia and secretary general Praveen Khandelwal and AITWA chairman Pradeep Singhal jointly announced the stir plan on the opening day of a three day national trade conference at Nagpur.“The GST Council has not only pampered various anomalies and distortions in ‘one nation-one tax’ principle of GST but has not taken any step to simplify the GST taxation system. The only aim of the GST Council so far is how to get more revenue and how to load the traders with more compliance burden without considering the ground realties of trade in India,” it said.The traders concede that GST is a progressive taxation system but want it to be free from glitches, anomalies, disparities and distortions.“Time and again, CAIT has expressed its view that the tax net of GST should be widened resulting into more revenue to the government but it is possible only when the GST is simplified to the extent that even a small trader operating his business activities at remote area could also be able to comply with GST without any external help,” said the statement.The current state of increased administrative tax compliance burden on traders and a locking-up of working capital due to slow tax refund processing, has led to high compliance costs because the prevalence of multiple tax rates implies a need to classify inputs and outputs based on the applicable tax rate, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pro-centre-traders-body-cait-calls-for-bharat-bandh-on-february-26-209661

09-02-2021||Mumbai/New Delhi||Maha govt to probe celebs tweets on farmer protest; BJP fumes||The Maharashtra government’s intelligence department will conduct a probe into allegations some celebrities were pressurised to post tweets with regard to the farmers’ protest, said Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Monday, drawing an angry response from the BJP.Deshmukh made the remarks on an online platform after the Congress, a ruling coalition ally in Maharashtra, sought an investigation into the BJP’s alleged connection with recent tweets of some celebrities on the ongoing farm protest and to find out whether the saffron party “arm-twisted” them in posting those statements which were deemed pro-Centre.In New Delhi, BJP president J P Nadda took a swipe at the Maharashtra government over the probe move, saying it has a unique model of governance that hails “noises of anarchy” from overseas but “harasses” patriotic Indians who stand for the nation.“MVA in Maharashtra has a unique model of governance - hail noises of anarchy from overseas who show India in poor light but harass patriotic Indians who stand for the nation.It is difficult to decide what is more flawed: their priorities or their mindset?” Nadda tweeted.Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant and some other party leaders on Monday raised the demand for a probe into tweets before Deshmukh in a meeting via video conference.Deshmukh, an NCP leader, is currently in isolation after testing positive for COVID-19 recently.A number of prominent personalities, including cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar and legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar, recently rallied around the central government on social media using hashtags #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda.This came after tweets by American pop star Rihanna and climate activist Greta Thunberg backing farmers who are protesting near Delhi’s border points against the Centre’s three new farm laws.After the virtual meeting with Deshmukh, Sawant in a tweet said, “Demanded investigation of BJP connection into the tweets of celebrities & security to be provided to our national heroes if needed & find out whether these celebrities were arm-twisted by BJP.”Responding to the demand, Deshmukh said the objection of the Congress leaders is in connection with the timing of the tweets and whether they were issued under pressure.Deshmukh noted the tweets posted by badminton star Saina Nehwal and Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar were similar.The Congress’s question is whether they (celebrities) were forced to issue tweets of the same kind simultaneously, the home minister said.“You may have seen what kind of pressure is there on the media, how a politician is threatened with ED or CBI probe if he/she speaks against the BJP. We have all seen this.“As far as your objection (about celebrities’ tweets) is concerned, we will definitely probe into those. Our intelligence agency will probe it,” Deshmukh said.Deshmukh said during the video conference, Sawant discussed this “serious issue” with him.“Despite being infected by COVID-19, I gave him time because this issue is related to farmers. I heard him out and assured to take action as per rules in this connection,” the minister said.Meanwhile, addressing reporters in Mumbai, Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole accused the central government of pressurising celebrities, “like the underworld” once used to do.He asked celebrities to not fall prey to such alleged pressure tactics because they are youth icons.The Narendra Modi government is using celebrities to divert attention from the issues concerning farmers, the poor, unemployed and small industrialists, Patole alleged.“The BJP government is doing what the underworld once used to do,” Patole said.Meanwhile, in a stinging attack, senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis termed the move to investigate tweets by celebrities as “disgusting and highly deplorable” and said the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) should feel ashamed while using the word “probe” for Bharat Ratna awardees.The leader of opposition in the Maharashtra assembly said it seems necessary to probe the “mental state” of those who demanded the investigation and those who ordered it.“Has this MVA Govt lost all its senses? MVA should feel ashamed while using the word ‘probe’ for BharatRatnas! Actually, now it seems necessary to probe the mental state & stability of the ones who made such demand & of people who ordered probe against our BharatRatnas!” Fadnavis tweeted.Hitting back at Fadnavis, Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sawant accused the BJP of deliberately trying to twist the issue.Sawant said the Congress demanded the “probe of the BJP (connection to the tweets)”, and not of celebrities.“Why BJP is keeping mum on why tweets of Akshay Kumar and Saina Nehwal are matching with each other? Why (Bollywood actor) Suniel Shetty tags his tweet to a BJP office-bearer?Why BJP is scared of probe?” Sawant tweeted.

The one-time relaxation will benefit over 3,300 students without even increasing the age-limit, it said.The Centre had initially opposed the idea, saying allowing an extra attempt to civil services aspirants who could not appear in their last chance in the 2020 examination due to the COVID-19 situation would create a “cascading effect”, detrimental to the overall functioning and level playing field necessary for a public examination system.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-sc-wants-centre-to-consider-extending-benefit-of-extra-chance-to-age-barred-candidates-209647
09-02-2021||New Delhi||Uttarakhand tragedy:  Environmentalists flag massive development projects in eco-sensitive Himalayas||The Uttarakhand tragedy on Sunday has generated a debate about what lead to the disaster, with some environmentalists questioning the official version of a “glacier burst”.“Are you sure it was a glacier burst or an avalanche,” questions Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People.Environmentalists have also questioned the central and state governments for clearing massive projects in eco-sensitive areas such as the Himalayas saying that the flood tragedy at Kedarnath in 2013 seems to have “taught no lessons”.Uma Bharati, a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party and a former member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet, claims she’d warned the central government about such a possibility when she was still a minister.“When I was the minister, my ministry in its affidavit about dams in Uttarakhand in the Himalayas had said that it is a very sensitive region and power projects should not be built on the Ganga and its main tributaries,” she said.Bharati says any shortfall in electricity should be covered by the national grid. Thakar however says that the central government must now consider wind and solar energy for mountainous areas.Uttarakhand currently has 98 big, medium, and small dams, and has been seeing a rapid increase in infrastructure development projects such as roads, highways, and hotels. The projects, environmentalists say, are shaking up the “younger” mountains of Himalayas, and that using dynamites on these younger mountains and deliberate man-made fires in eco-sensitive areas could further exacerbate the situation.“The Rishi Ganga project was neither ecologically nor socially acceptable and locals had raised voice against the project. Now there should be a disaster potential assessment of the project, Thakkar said. There has also been local opposition for another project—the NTPC-owned Vishnughad Tapovan power plant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-tragedy-%C2%A0environmentalists-flag-massive-development-projects-in-eco-sensitive-himalayas-209645

We are ready for talks with them (government),” Kakka told PTI.Centre complicating issue, says Rakesh Tikait on PM Modi's statement on MSPEleven rounds of talks have been held over the contentious farm laws but the impasse continues as the farmer unions remain firm on their demands—the repeal of the three laws and legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP).In the last round of talks, the government had offered to suspend the laws for 12-18 months, but the farmer unions rejected it.Thousands of agitating farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points --- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur --- for over 70 days.Read also: Modi appeals to agitators to give farm laws a chanceCentre complicating issue, says Rakesh Tikait on PM Modi's statement on MSPTo weed out right-wingers, volunteers screen farmers living in Ghazipur tentsWhile replying in Rajya Sabha on Monday to a debate on the President’s address, PM Modi assured the farmers that Mandis will be modernised, saying “Not just this, MSP was there, it is there and will remain.”“We urge those sitting on the agitation that even though it is their right to agitate, the way the old people are sitting there, is not right.“They (agitators) should be taken back. They should end the agitation and we will together find a solution as all doors are open for dialogue. From this House, I again invite them for dialogue,” Modi said while appealing to farmers to end their agitation.Farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar, who is also a member of Samkyukta Kisan Morcha, said the government has already said “hundreds of times” that the MSP will not go anywhere and it will remain in place.“If the government is claiming that MSP will remain, why doesn’t it provide a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for our crops,” Kohar told PTI.He said the farmer unions are ready to resume talks with the government, but there should be a formal invitation.“Any issue can be resolved through proper dialogue. We are ready in-principle to resume talks,” the farmer leader.In his speech, Modi slammed the mushrooming of a new breed of ‘andolan-jivi’—professional protestors—who are seen at every agitation. These “parasites feast on every agitation,” he said.“Agitation has an important role in democracy. People have a right to oppose the government’s wrong policies,” Kakka said, referring to the remarks by the prime minister.Sukhdev Singh, Punjab general secretary of BKU Ekta-Ugrahan, sought to know why the government is not ensuring a legal guarantee on MSP for crops and alleged that it is trying to divert the issue.Farmer leader Baldev Singh also said government should repeal these farm laws and provide a legal guarantee on MSP for farmers’ crops.Earlier in the day, farmer leader Rakesh Tikait said business over hunger will not be allowed in the country.To press their demands, protesting unions held a nationwide ‘chakka jam’ last week, during which national and state highways were blocked in Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country.

Modi has appealed to the farmers to end the agitation.The Prime Minister told the Rajya Sabha that the MSP is not going to end and there is an emphasis to modernise the mandi system.After PM’s invite, farmer leaders say ready for talks, ask govt to choose dateSpeaking on the farmers' agitation, Modi said many things were discussed about the farmers' movement, but everyone is silent on the main issue of it.The PM said, "I assure the Upper House that the mandis would be modernised. The MSP was, is and will always be in place. More than 80 crore people will continue to get ration at cheap rates. Our Union Agriculture Minister (Narendra Singh Tomar) has discussed it very well." Responding to PM Modi's statement, Tikait said, "We never said that the MSP is going to end rather we want a law on it. The law on MSP will only benefit the farmers. Due to the lack of law on MSP, the traders purchase the produce at half the rate."Give farm laws a chance: PMThe BKU spokesperson said, "Initially, the protest was tagged as a protest of Punjab then it was tagged as Jat and Sikh protest. This is a farmers' protest and all the farmers of the country are united and same. None of them are big or small." "The price of produce can't be fixed as per the demand. We won't let people trade on the interests of the farmers," he added.On Modi's appeal to end the agitation, Tikait said, "If the government wants to hold a discussion, we are ready for it.

As the political situation in his home state continues to be fluid and hence, if he seeks to return to the Rajya Sabha, Kerala is the state where the Congress-led UDF can send him as one of their candidates to the Upper House.Of the three outgoing members, one is veteran Congress leader Vayalar Ravi and the other is Abdul Wahab, who represents the Indian Union Muslim League -- the second biggest ally in the opposition UDF. The third member to retire is young CPI(M) leader K.K. Ragesh.The ruling Left Front government in Kerala will be able to send two nominees to the Upper House and the Congress will get the other seat.But the last word in the Congress party is its High Command and last year, Congress leader from Kerala K.C. Venugopal was brought into the Upper House from Rajasthan and hence it wouldn't be a surprise, if Azad gets in from Kerala.However, the Congress leaders in Kerala are tight-lipped and appear not too pleased with the news. None of them wants to displease the High Command at this juncture, which can possibly play spoilsport to their chances of securing an Assembly seat.Kerala is all set to go for Assembly elections in April/May. The Congress expects that with Azad being a Muslim, it could well prove to be a plus point with the community, which in Kerala has a share of 22 per cent in the population and is presently the second biggest community after the Hindus. Christians account for around 19 per cent. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ghulam-nabi-azad-may-seek-re-election-to-rajya-sabha-from-kerala-209590
09-02-2021||Dehradun/New Delhi||Uttarakhand disaster: 26 bodies recovered, 171 missing; experts study cause||Twenty-six bodies have been recovered and 171 people still missing after the Uttarakhand disaster apparently caused by a glacier burst, officials said on Monday, as multiple agencies worked at rescuing over 30 workers feared trapped in a tunnel at a power project site.Officials said 171 people are still missing, a day after a portion of the Nanda Devi glacier possibly burst through its banks in Chamoli district.It appeared to have triggered an avalanche and a deluge that ripped through the Alaknanda river system in the upper reaches of the ecologically fragile Himalayas.Experts, however, are still trying to determine the exact cause of the disaster in Joshimath.“It was due to lakhs of metric tonnes of snow sliding down abruptly from a trigger point on top of a naked hill,” Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat told reporters after meeting ISRO scientists.After a comprehensive analysis is undertaken to find out the reasons, “we will build an elaborate plan to avert any potential tragedy going forward”, he said in an interview to PTI.Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured a delegation of Uttarakhand MPs of his government’s support to the people of the state and said it is working to strengthen infrastructure there to deal with any natural disaster in future.The 171 reported missing include those working at hydel power project sites and villagers whose homes nearby were washed away with the force of the raging waters, officials said.Two power projects — NTPC’s 480 MW Tapovan-Vishnugad project and the 13.2 MW Rishiganga Hydel Project — were extensively damaged with scores of labourers caught in tunnels as the waters came rushing in.Thirteen villages are cut off.Rescue efforts in the affected areas near Joshimath, about 295 km from here, gained momentum with teams of the Army, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) coordinating to rescue 30-35 people feared trapped in a tunnel at the Tapovan-Vishnugad project.More teams have been sent to the site on Mi-17 helicopters that landed at the helipad in Joshimath, NDRF chief SN Pradhan said in a Twitter post.Some teams from the Army, including from the Medical Corps, also reached the disaster spot, an official supervising the operation said.Sniffer dogs and heavy mechanical equipment, including bulldozers and JCBs, were deployed.Officials said 27 people were rescued alive. Of these, 12 were saved from the smaller of the two tunnels at the Tapovan-Vishnugad project site and 15 from the Rishiganga site.Uttarakhand Director General of Police Ashok Kumar added that efforts were focused on rescuing 30-35 labourers trapped in a 250-metre tunnel at Tapovan.The work was complicated as the tunnel is slightly curved, making it difficult to clear the debris and silt blocking it.The entire landscape was coloured a sandy grey, many structures swept away and buried under piles of silt.“Our teams worked overnight to rescue about 30 workers who are trapped in the tunnel. Specialised equipment for such operations has been deployed. We are hopeful we will able to rescue everyone,” ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey told PTI in Delhi.“There is a huge amount of debris inside the tunnel. About 80 metres inside the tunnel is cleared and accessible, and it looks like about 100 more metres of debris will have to be cleared,” he added.Pandey said nearly 300 ITBP personnel are deployed at the site.Also read: UN ready to contribute to ongoing rescue efforts in Uttarakhand: GuterresWith no rain or melting of snow, floods in Chamoli peculiar: ExpertsA tranquil morning turns into tragedy for Uttarakhand villagersPlan afoot to develop multi-hazard early warning system, says govtIn a video provided by the ITBP, a team of senior officials was seen analysing the tunnel’s map to find the best way of approach.The tunnel has only one entry, an official said.Global warming or maybe a western disturbance bringing fresh snow that melted could have triggered the deluge, experts said.The Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) of the Defence Research and Development Organisation is among those investigating the disaster.It is not clear whether the flood was a typical Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) or some temporary damming due to a landslide and avalanche that might have blocked the mainstream to form a temporary lake which burst, said Ranjit Rath, director general of the Geological Survey of India (GSI).Union ministers Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and RK Singh as well as Pauri MP Tirath Singh Rawat, Uttarakhand minister Dhan Singh Rawat met the affected families in disaster-hit Tapovan and Raini.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also expressed solidarity.ITBP deploys sniffer dogs at the #TapovanTunnel for rescue operations.

They are stable now.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the United Nations stands ready to contribute to the rescue and assistance efforts if necessary.“The Secretary-General is deeply saddened by the reported loss of life and dozens missing following the glacier burst and subsequent flooding in Uttarakhand state, India, on Sunday,” his spokesperson said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-disaster-26-bodies-recovered-171-missing-experts-study-cause-209562
09-02-2021||New Delhi||Modi appeals to agitators to give farm laws a chance||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday appealed to agitating farmers to give the new farm laws a chance and see if these laws bring a positive change to their lives.“If there is any drawback in the laws, these would be corrected. If there is a loose end somewhere, it will be tightened. Our doors are open for suggestions," the Prime Minister said.Centre complicating issue, says Rakesh Tikait on PM Modi's statement on MSPModi, while giving his reply at the Rajya Sabha to the debate following the President’s address on the inaugural day of the Budget Session on January 29, asserted that the system of Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops would continue to remain in practice.“MSP was there, it is there and it is going to be there in future”, Modi said. He also assured that there was no question of the abolition of distribution of ration through the PDS. He said 82 crore people availed ration from the PDS.After PM’s invite, farmer leaders say ready for talks, ask govt to choose dateMandis would be modernized, the Prime Minister said and added that a provision had been made in the current budget for this purpose.The Prime Minister implored the farmers camping at the outskirts of Delhi demanding the repeal of the three farm laws to return home. “It does not feel nice. There are also old people in the gathering,” the Prime Minister said.Modi also appealed to the MPs to request the agitating farmers to leave. “If the laws produce an adverse impact, pass the blame to me–if the laws work, take all the credit,” the Prime Minister told the opposition MPs and sought their cooperation.“We should not spread misinformation. We have been entrusted with serious responsibility by people,” Modi said.Stating he was happy that Manmohan Singh was present in the House, Modi said the idea of a “one large common market” for agricultural produce was also envisaged by the former Prime Minister.To substantiate his claim, Modi quoted Manmohan Singh as having said that the existing marketing regime prevented farmers from selling their produce where they could get the highest rate of return.“It is our endeavour to remove all those handicaps that came in the way of India realizing its vast potential as one large common market,” Modi quoted Manmohan Singh as having said.Modi said former prime minister Charan Singh, was concerned about small farmers (having less than one-hectare land). From being 51 per cent of the peasantry in Charan Singh’s time, small farmers now constituted 68 per cent of the peasantry, Modi said.A whopping 12 crore people fall in this category of farmers.Modi added that these farmers, who are not given a loan by banks and so do not benefit from loan waiver schemes introduced by state governments as a political sop, will benefit from the new farm laws.Modi claimed that while a lot of words had been said in the House regarding the agitation against the farm laws, not much was said to challenge the laws itself.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-appeals-to-agitators-to-give-farm-laws-a-chance-209552
