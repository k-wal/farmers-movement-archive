Results will be declared on May 2 along with the three other poll- bound states and the union territory of Puducherry.West Bengal has a 294-member assembly.

So it’s unique,” Maru, who is organising the auction, said.According to a statement on Marudhar Arts’ portal, Kam Bakhsh took active part in the wars.In 1707, he seized the control of the Bijapur fort and declared himself the king.Gradually, Kam Bakhsh’s sway extended across much of Deccan winning control over Hyderabad, erstwhile Gulbarga (now Kalaburagi), Shahpur and Wakinkhera.His inefficiency in handling administration led to the collapse of his kingdom, they said.The older son of Aurangzeb, Shah Alam Bahadur after taking reins of the Mughal empire took a serious note of Kam Bakhsh striking coins in his name.In a pitched battle that ensued between the two armies on 13 January 1709, Kam Bakhsh was captured and the next day he died of wounds.This coin is unusual and important, Marudhar Arts said explaining that coins of Kam Bakhsh are known from a number of mints  Bijapur, Ahsanabad, Nusratabad, Haidarabad, Torgal, Gokak, Imtiyazgarh  but this combination is not yet recorded for any of these issues.“We do not know when Kam Bakhsh declared himself the emperor but it must have been sometime in March 1707, soon after the fort of Bijapur came under his control, but we don’t know the exact date for this event,” the statement said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rare-coin-of-the-fifth-son-of-mughal-emperor-aurangazeb-goes-under-the-hammer-fetches-rs-56-lakh-218312

No one is talking about him. He is innocent. He was severely beaten up by the police, his bones are broken. I request people to raise voice for his bail as well,” said Kaur during a press conference at Singhu border.A medical examination of Kumar conducted by a Chandigarh-based hospital has found two fractures on his hand and foot along with some broken nail beds on his toe.Kaur’s arrest received global attention after Meena Harris, niece of American Vice President Kamala Harris, tweeted saying the activist was “arrested, tortured & sexually assaulted in police custody”.Kaur, who rejoined the farmers protest at Singhu border on Saturday, said the ongoing movement has space for everyone to contribute, whether it is farmers or workers.Talking about her case, Kaur claimed she has done nothing wrong and that police have no evidence against her.She also accused the police of beating her up in the custody.“They abused me, pulled my hair, slapped me and made me sign papers forcefully. I couldn’t even walk,” she alleged.In her bail plea also, the 23-year-old activist had claimed to have been severely beaten up at a police station after she was arrested by the Sonipat Police on January 12.However, police have denied the charge as “baseless”.

27-02-2021||New Delhi||Ravidas remembered on birth anniversary; Mayawati accuses BJP, Congress of ‘neglecting’ Dalit, Adivasi saints||The contribution of saint-poet Ravidas to the society was recalled on his birth anniversary on Friday with several leaders urging people to take inspiration from his teachings even as BSP president Mayawati accused the BJP and the Congress of “always neglecting saints and great men born in Dalit, Adivasi and OBC” families.Paying rich tributes, President Ram Nath Kovind said, through his teachings, Ravidas delivered the message of equality, justice, peace and harmony to mankind.Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi also recalled the saint’s messages of unity while Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav offered prayers at a temple dedicated to the seer at his birthplace in Varanasi. “My humble tributes to great poet-saint Guru Ravidas Ji on his Jayanti today. Ravidas Ji believed in universal brotherhood and spread the message of unity through his writings & teachings. As we remember him, let us emulate his teachings & resolve to follow the path shown by him,” Naidu said on Twitter.Modi said the messages given by Ravidas centuries ago on equality, goodwill and compassion will inspire the people of the country for ages.“My humble tributes to him (Saint Ravidas) on his birth anniversary),” he tweeted.Paying tributes, BSP president Mayawati asked the BJP-led Central and the Uttar Pradesh governments to follow the path shown by Ravidas in serving the society and country.In tweets in Hindi, she recalled the works done by the governments led by her to realise the dreams of Ravidas.“Under the BSP governments formed in the state four times, a lot of effort was made to realise the dreams of Santguru Ravidasji, and the work done in public interest and public welfare in his honour is not hidden from anyone. It will be appropriate if the central and state governments do good for the society and country by following the path shown by him,” she said.In a press release issued later, Mayawati said that the message given by Ravidas was not for fulfilling political motives but for serving the society, which has been completely forgotten in the present times, leading to tension and violence.Recalling the works done in his honour, she said that her government had named Bhadohi district after him but it was changed by the previous Samajwadi Party government due to “casteist mentality”. She promised that once her party comes to power, Bhadohi will be renamed as Sant Ravidas Nagar.Noting that governments led by other political parties, including the Congress and BJP, had always neglected saints and great men born in Dalit, Adivasi and OBC sections of the society, she said that instead of giving them respect, they had shown contempt for such great men.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said Ravidas’ birth in Kashi 645 years ago gave a new dimension to the tradition of Sanatan dharma in India. Addressing an event organised at the Sant Ravidas temple in Lucknow, he said the spiritual practice is the result of a pure mind and Guru Ravidas is the biggest example of this.“Guru Ravidasji perfectly demonstrated how a person achieves greatness through his deeds and how one should be revered,” he said.Adityanath also said his government has started working on the beautification of the seer’s birthplace in Varanasi and requested members of the Sant Ravidas Seva Samiti to prepare an action plan for this drive.After offering prayers at Seer Govardhan temple, Gandhi Vadra said Ravidas taught people a true religion which is easy and has no politics or discrimination. She hoped that the aspiration of Ravidas that people should be served and there should be harmony are maintained in politics.Yadav visited the Govardhan temple and paid floral tributes.“Sant Ravidas was a social reformer, revolutionary and independent thinker and strongly opposed wrong practices. His entire life was dedicated towards unity, brotherhood and equality in the society. According to him, serving mankind is the real dharma,” a statement quoting Yadav said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ravidas-remembered-on-birth-anniversary-mayawati-accuses-bjp-congress-of-neglecting-dalit-adivasi-saints-218286

27-02-2021||New Delhi||Rare Disease Day: Health advocacy groups press for govt policy, say India’s numbers unknown||Only 450 of the 8,000 known rare diseases in the world are recognised in India, an anomaly that underscores a mounting health crisis in which many patients go without being diagnosed accurately or treated on time, say experts while stressing the urgent need for a comprehensive policy.Rare diseases, including genetic disorders such as Hunter syndrome, Gaucher disease and Fabry’s disease, are expensive to treat, difficult to identify and extract a huge toll, mostly on the young, the experts said ahead of Rare Disease Day on Sunday.The lack of a government policy also means the disease burden is unknown, said health advocacy groups.“We are literally sitting on a ticking time bomb,” said Prasanna Shirol, executive director and co-founder of the Organisation of Rare Diseases in India (ORDI).According to ORDI, there are 8,000 known rare diseases globally but only 450 are recognised in India.“There is no official list of identified rare diseases issued by the government. The 450 diseases identified are reported by the patients. Fifty per cent of the rare diseases are by birth and the rest are late onset. Only seven of the 450 are treatable diseases, the rest need to be managed,” Shirol told PTI.Lack of awareness is the biggest challenge in diagnosing rare diseases, he said, explaining that the average time to identify a rare disease in a patient is seven years.While the government has earmarked special funds for diseases such as haemophilia (Rs 1,400 crore per year) and thalassaemia (Rs 700 crore), it has completely ignored the more serious ones, he said.“What the government believes is utterly contradictory. They ask why should they initiate anything massive for a group which does not have a massive patient burden unlike non-communicable diseases like cancers, but what I say is that to know the real burden it has to make newborn screening mandatory,” Shirol told PTI.Shirol, who has a daughter with a genetic disorder, said a policy from the government can bring some order to the lives of people with such conditions in the country.“It appears hope is the only medicine government is trying to give us for our genuine demands,” he said.While there is no formal definition for a rare disease, global health bodies say it is characterised by three factors—the total number of people having the disease, its prevalence and the non-availability of treatment.According to the website rarediseaseday.org, 72 per cent of rare diseases are genetic whilst others are the result of infections (bacterial or viral), allergies and environmental causes, or are degenerative and proliferative. An estimated 70 percent of genetic rare diseases start in childhood.Health groups in India have also urged the government to make newborn screening mandatory to be able to identify genetical problems at an early stage. The monthly treatment cost of such diseases can be anywhere between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 50 lakh, they said.Rare diseases are also not covered by insurance policies. It is imperative the government steps in to help these patients so they can lead a near normal life, they said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rare-disease-day-health-advocacy-groups-press-for-govt-policy-say-indias-numbers-unknown-218271

27-02-2021||Lucknow||Want alliance with BJP for upcoming polls, as well for 2022 UP elections: RPI chief Athawale||Union minister Ramdas Athawale on Saturday said his Republican Party of India (RPI) wants an alliance with the BJP for the upcoming polls in four states and the Union Territory of Puducherry, as also for the 2022 Uttar Pradesh elections.He said talks will be held with Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath this evening over an alliance in the state, and also with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president JP Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah in due course.“If the BJP leaves 8-10 seats, the RPI can be used to give a jolt to the BSP,” he said talking about Uttar Pradesh, claiming that people in the state are getting disenchanted with Mayawati’s party and are shifting towards the RPI.On alliance in the poll-bound Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry, the RPI president said his party wants to contest these elections together with the BJP.However, if it was not given seats by the BJP, the RPI would field its candidates on some seats and extend support to saffron party on the others, he said.He pointed out the Dalit constitutes 36 per cent population of West Bengal, and the BJP would benefit if RPI fights the election with it.Athawale, whose RPI is a BJP ally at the Centre, also praised the works done by Prime Minister Modi and Chief Minister Adityanath.Asked about any political understanding with Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, Athawale said Azad is an “independent person, but if he joins my party he will be given an important post”.The Dalit leader extended Azad and BSP president Mayawati invitations to join his party.“If Mayawati comes, she would be given the post of the president of RPI and I will myself opt for the post of vice president as this is the party of Babasaheb (Bhimrao Ambedkar),” Athawale said.When pointed out that the BJP was not inclined to give his party any seat, he said, “As of now, our organisation is not very strong but we are strengthening it at the district-level.”       He also claimed that the BJP would be getting more than 200 seats in West Bengal. “There is a resentment against the government in the state.”    The NDA will form its government in four states and in Kerala too, it can succeed since people there are intending to hand over power to the BJP, he said.On the ongoing farmers agitation against the Centre’s three agricultural reforms laws, he said, “Our government is not against farmers but if one law is repealed, there would be pressure to withdraw all laws. The government is ready for amendment in the farm law.”                 On the issue of Maharashtra Congress unit president Nana Patole’s announcement to oppose film actors Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar on the issue of inflation, the RPI president said that his party has decided to support the Bollywood stars.When questioned about his silence over inflation and why he does not criticise the BJP over the issue, Athawale said, “I do not raise my voice against the BJP as our two voices are the same.”To a question on Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s visit to Varanasi on the occasion of Sant Ravidas Jayanti, Athawale said she can visit whichever temple she wants but there is no future for the Congress till there is Rahul Gandhi.The RPI president demanded the landless people of Uttar Pradesh be given 5 acre land by the Adityanath government.The union minister also said that Marathas in Maharashtra, Jaats in Haryana and Rajputs in Uttar Pradesh are demanding reservation and so they should also get 10-12% quota.He also said that the 2021 census be caste-based so as to find out the actual caste data on the country. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/want-alliance-with-bjp-for-upcoming-polls-as-well-for-2022-up-elections-rpi-chief-athawale-218256

All three officials will have to reside in India.They will have to publish a monthly compliance report and details of the contents removed proactively.At present, the country has 53 crore WhatsApp users, 44.8 crore YouTube users, 41 crore Facebook subscribers, 21 crore Instagram clients, while 1.75 crore account holders are on microblogging platform Twitter."...the Central Government hereby specifies fifty lakh registered users in India as the threshold for a social media intermediary to be considered a significant social media intermediary," the notification said.Earlier on Thursday, the government announced the tightening of the rules governing social media and streaming companies, requiring them to take down contentious content quicker, appoint grievance redressal officers and assist investigations.The move aims to make social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and Instagram - which have seen a phenomenal surge in usage over the past few years in India - more accountable and responsible for the content hosted on their platform.Social media companies will have to remove contentious content flagged by the government or court orders within 36 hours and take down posts depicting nudity or morphed photos within 24 hours of receiving a complaint, as per the latest intermediary rules.Also, social media platforms on being asked by the court or government will be required to disclose the first originator of the mischievous information that undermines the sovereignty of India, security of the state, or public order.The new guidelines followed the government's spat with Twitter over allegedly inflammatory tweets and hashtags supporting farmer protests, with the microblogging service initially refusing to comply with orders to take down about 1,500 such posts and accounts. Twitter complied after it was threatened with penal action.

It is obvious that all that has been said was good for the institution and will not in any manner scandalise the court or lower its authority in the eyes of law," Venugopal said in his letter to the activist, denying consent for initiating the proceedings.Venugopal said though the ex-CJI's statements were strong, they reflected his views on the ills of the judiciary.The plea, seeking consent to initiate contempt proceedings against the nominated Rajya Sabha MP, had specifically referred to the statements of Justice Gogoi, who had said, “You want a 5 trillion dollar economy but you have a ramshackled judiciary...if you were to go to court, you would only be washing your dirty linen in court. You won't get a verdict. I have no hesitation in saying it.”Under the Contempt of Courts Act and the rules, the consent of attorney general or the solicitor general is required for filing a criminal contempt case by a private individual.

27-02-2021||Mumbai||Centre’s social media rules are dictatorial, says Maharashtra minister||A Maharashtra minister on Saturday opposed the Centre’s regulations for social media platforms and over-the-top (OTT) players, terming them as “dictatorial” and a “threat” to democracy.Minister of State for IT Satej Patil said these regulations needed to be opposed strongly as they infringed the privacy of individuals and free speech given by the Constitution.“This move by the Centre needs to be fought tooth and nail. Such dictatorial regulations will not be accepted by the people of this democratic country,” he said.Some bureaucrats deciding on what needs to be published and what not on any media platform is nothing but an attack on the freedom of press in India, Patil added.“Such orders will not have any standing in the court of law,” he said.Talking about the arrest of activist Disha Ravi for her alleged involvement in sharing a “toolkit” on social media related to the farmers’ protest, the senior Congress leader from Kolhapur said the entire episode was an act to suppress the voice of those who are exercising their freedom to speech.A Delhi court recently granted bail to the activist.The Centre on February 25 announced sweeping regulations for social media firms, such as Facebook and Twitter as well as OTT players like Netflix, requiring them to remove any content flagged by authorities within 36 hours and setting up a complaint redressal mechanism with an officer being based in the country.The regulations also make it mandatory for platforms such as Twitter and WhatsApp to identify the originator of a message that authorities consider to be anti-national and against security and sovereignty of the country.

The recent developments in Myanmar are, therefore, being closely monitored by India. We remain concerned that the gains made by Myanmar over the last decades on the path towards democracy should not get undermined,” he said.Tirumurti said India believed the rule of law and democratic process must be upheld, those detained be released and that calm prevailed."We call on the Myanmar leadership to work together to resolve their differences in a peaceful and constructive manner,” he said.On February 1, the military seized power in Myanmar and detained de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, President U Win Myint and other top political leaders in the bloodless coup.Tirumurti said India, as the largest democracy, has always been steadfast in its support to the process of democratic transition in Myanmar for it to emerge as a stable democratic federal union and a significant area of New Delhi's focus has been capacity building, including in the areas of constitution and federalism for political leaders and elected representatives.“India as a close friend and neighbour of Myanmar and its people, will continue to closely monitor the situation and will remain in discussion with like-minded countries so that the hopes and aspirations of the people are respected."Restoring democratic order should be the priority of all stakeholders in Myanmar,” he said, adding that the international community must lend its constructive support to the people of Myanmar at this critical juncture.

That is even more debt owed per citizen. There is a lot of misinformation about where the debt is going. The top two countries we owe the debt to are China and Japan, not actually our friends,” Congressman Alex Mooney said.“We are at global competition with China all the time. They are holding a lot of the debt. We owe China over USD 1 trillion, and we owe Japan over USD 1 trillion,” the Republican Senator from West Virginia said on the floor of the US House of Representatives as he and others opposed the latest stimulus package of USD 2 trillion.In January, US President Joe Biden announced a USD 1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package to tackle the economic fallout from the pandemic, including direct financial aid to average Americans, support to businesses and to provide a boost to the national vaccination programme.“The people who are loaning us the money we have to pay back are not necessarily people who have our best interest at heart. In Brazil, we owe USD 258 billion. In India, we owe USD 216 billion. And the list goes on the debt that is owed to foreign countries,” Congressman Mooney said.America’s national debt was USD5.6 trillion in 2000. During the Obama administration, it actually doubled.“Since the eight years Obama was President, we doubled our national debt. And we are adding another—projected here—a completely out of control debt-to-GDP ratio,” he said urging his Congressional colleagues to consider this national debt issue before approving the stimulus package.“So I urge my colleagues to consider the future. Don’t buy into the—the government has no money it doesn’t take from you that you are going to have to pay back. We need to be judicious with these dollars, and most of this is not going to coronavirus relief anyway,” he said.Congressmen Mooney said that things have gone completely out of control. The Congressional Budget Office estimates an additional USD 104 trillion will be added by 2050. The Congressional Budget Office forecasted debt would rise 200 per cent.“Today, as I stand here right now, we have USD 27.9 trillion in national debt...That is actually a little more than USD 84,000 of debt to every American citizen right here today,” Mooney said.“We have actually borrowed USD 10,000 per person in one year. I mean, that is out of control,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-owes-india-usd-216-billion-as-american-debt-soars-to-usd-29-trillion-lawmaker-218216

A win in Kerala would be crucial for Rahul’s leadership of the Congress where dissenters have been questioning his inability to get votes. Although the Congress has declared it would win 100 segments in 126-member Assam Assembly, it faces incumbent BJP.last-minute schemes announced||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/high-stake-elections-ahead-all-eyes-on-bengal-tamil-nadu-218138

West Bengal will have maximum eight phases, Assam three while Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry will go for single-phase voting.The elections are expected to witness a determined attempt by the BJP to put up a strong show, including in Assam where it is already in power, as well as in West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry where the party has been pushing hard in recent years.At a media briefing to announce the poll dates, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said two special observers would be appointed for West Bengal while a third could also be sent if required. He was responding to queries on whether enough arrangements were in place in the state where questions were being raised about political violence. The elections in Assam will be conducted in three phases on March 27, April 1 and April 6, while polling in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry will take place in a single phase on April 6. The elections in West Bengal will be held in eight phases, up from seven last time, beginning with polling for 30 seats on March 27.Responding to questions on the increased number of phases in West Bengal, the CEC said, “The elections to West Bengal (Assembly) in 2016 were in seven phases. The Lok Sabha was in seven phases. So, seven to eight phases is not such a big deal because we also have to see the movement of forces, we also have to see the current charges and counter-charges (by political parties).” To keep a watch on the use of money power in Tamil Nadu, the EC has appointed two special expenditure observers. In Assam, Kerala and Puducherry, there will be single observer.Arora said arrangements would be put in place for candidates to file their nominations online. Also, webcasting arrangements will be in place at polling stations in critical and vulnerable areas, while adequate paramilitary deployment would be ensured, he said. All critical and vulnerable areas had been identified and advance teams had already been deployed across the four states and the UT, he said.Arora said the nationwide vaccination drive had made the situation more conducive for conducting elections and the Health Ministry had declared everyone on poll duty as frontline workers for vaccination purposes.5 cars for roadshowDoor-to-door campaigning will be restricted to five persons, including the candidate, while roadshows will be allowed with a maximum of five vehicles.Online nominationThere will be a provision to file nominations online.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry said both sides had agreed to set up a communication hotline to exchange opinions in a “timely” manner.Releasing details of the 75-minute telephonic talk between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, the MEA said the two “discussed the situation along the LAC in eastern Ladakh and issues related to overall India-China tiess”.Jaishankar was upfront about China’s “provocative behaviour and unilateral attempts to alter the status quo. “It is necessary to disengage at all friction points to contemplate de-escalation of forces in this sector. That alone will lead to restoration of peace and provide conditions for progress of bilateral relationship,” he said.Wang’s observations released by the Foreign Office quoted him as saying that the “border issue is not the whole story of China-India ties, and should be placed in a proper position in their relationship”. Wang also said India had “vacillated and even moved backward over its policy on China, affecting pragmatic cooperation”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-agree-to-set-up-hotline-for-sorting-out-issues-218002

The move is seen as a step towards making flying more affordable and accessible to passengers. According to the current rules, passengers are permitted to carry up to 7-kg cabin baggage and 15-kg check-in baggage.The DGCA has said if a passenger with a discount ticket turns up with baggage, “he/she will be charged as applicable”.“Scheduled airlines will be allowed to offer free baggage allowance as well as ‘zero baggage/no check-in baggage’ fares,” it said. This would be subject to “the condition that the passenger booking ticket under such fare scheme is made aware of the charges that shall be applicable if he turns up with the baggage at the time of check-in,” it added.The DGCA has also allowed unbundling of other services, including preferential seating, meal-snack-drink, sports equipment and musical instrument charge etc.“Considering the fact that unbundling of services has the potential to make basic fare more affordable, it has been decided to allow these services to be charged separately on opt-in basis,” the aviation regulator said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/now-lower-airfare-if-no-check-in-luggage-218054

It is ordered accordingly,” it said.The apex court was hearing a plea filed by the Army officer seeking divorce alleging mental cruelty by his wife who is holding a faculty position in a government PG College.They got married in 2006 and lived together for a few months, but differences cropped up and they have lived apart since 2007.The wife also filed a petition against the husband for restitution of conjugal rights and for resumption of matrimonial life.The Bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Hrishikesh Roy, said: “The degree of tolerance will vary from one couple to another and the court will have to bear in mind the background, the level of education and also the status of the parties, in order to determine whether the cruelty alleged is sufficient to justify dissolution of marriage, at the instance of the wronged party.”“For considering dissolution of marriage at the instance of a spouse who alleges mental cruelty, the result of such mental cruelty must be such that it is not possible to continue with the matrimonial relationship,” the Bench addedThe court said the allegations were levelled by a highly educated spouse and they do have the propensity to irreparably damage the character and reputation of the appellant.The apex court noted that materials in the present case reveal that the wife had made several defamatory complaints to the appellant’s superiors in the Army for which, a Court of Inquiry was conducted by the Army. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/damaging-reputation-of-spouse-amounts-to-mental-cruelty-supreme-court-218062

However, GFCE has played a critical role since April 2020 as apart from supporting lives and livelihoods it provided the initial stimulus to the economy.The recovery in manufacturing and construction augurs well for the support these sectors are expected to provide to growth in FY 2021-22.Real GVA in manufacturing has improved from a contraction of 35.9 per cent in Q1 to a positive growth of 1.6 % in Q3 while in construction the recovery has been from a contraction of 49.4 per cent in Q1 to a positive growth of 6.2 % in Q3.These sectors are vital to the economy to achieve a growth of 11 % or more in 2021-22 as they will be impacted most by the counter cyclical fiscal policy that budgets fiscal deficit at 6.8 % of GDP.Real GVA in Services has also improved from a contraction of 21.4 % in Q1 to a negligible contraction of 1 % in Q3 of 2020-21.This is a welcome as activity levels in contact-based services appear to have risen with a decline in the pandemic curve.The government also cautioned that the estimates are likely to undergo a sharp revision, and have asked users to take this into consideration when interpreting the figures.The next release of quarterly GDP estimates for Q4 (January-March) will be on May 31.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gdp-back-in-positive-territory-but-barely-217830

Your commitment to #COVAX and sharing #COVID19 vaccine doses is helping 60+ countries start vaccinating their #healthworkers and other priority groups. I hope other countries will follow your example," he said in the tweet on Thursday.India on Wednesday dispatched the first batch of six lakh Covid vaccine doses to the African country of Ghana under the COVAX facility in collaboration with UNICEF, which aims to cover 92 countries under the initiative.The doses are a part of the first batch of Covid vaccine the country is acquiring through the Covid Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX), which Ghana among nearly 92 countries have signed into.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on February 12 said that India had provided over 229 lakh doses of coronavirus vaccines to various countries out of which 64 lakh doses had been supplied as grant assistance and 165 lakh on commercial basis.MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said India would continue to take forward the global vaccine supply initiative and cover more countries in a phased manner.Consignments of coronavirus vaccine doses were supplied as gifts to Bangladesh (20 lakh), Myanmar (17 lakh), Nepal (10 lakh), Bhutan (1.5 lakh), the Maldives (1 lakh), Mauritius (1 lakh), Seychelles (50,000), Sri Lanka (5 lakh), Bahrain (1 lakh), Oman (1 lakh), Afghanistan (5 lakh), Barbados (1 lakh) and Dominica (70,000), he said.Thank you @DrTedros.

27-02-2021||London||‘Astonishing, inappropriate’: UK court on ex-SC judge Katju’s testimony in Nirav Modi case||The UK judge who handed down his judgment on Thursday in favour of the extradition of Nirav Modi to face charges of fraud and money laundering in India said he had found no evidence of adverse political influence in the case, as claimed by the diamond merchant’s legal team.In support of their claims, Modi’s lawyers had deposed retired Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju – of whom District Judge Samuel Goozee was highly critical and dubbed the evidence as “less than objective and reliable”.Also read: Arthur Road jail keeps special cell ready to lodge Nirav Modi“Albeit, some political commentary could be described as ill-advised, there is nothing in the volumes of media, broadcasting or social media links that have been referred to me in the voluminous defence bundles that gives any indication that politicians are trying to influence the outcome of any trial, let alone NDM’s (Nirav Deepak Modi) trial or that the trial process itself would be susceptible to such influence,” Justice Goozee notes.“I reject any submission that the GOI (government of India) have deliberately engineered a media onslaught. I attach little weight to Justice Katju’s expert opinion,” he said.With reference to Katju’s testimony via videolink last year, Justice Goozee felt it appeared tinged with resentment towards former senior judicial colleagues and described parts of it as “astonishing, inappropriate and grossly insensitive comparisons”.Also read: UK court allows fugitive Nirav Modi’s extradition“It had hallmarks of an outspoken critic with his own personal agenda. I found his evidence and behaviour in engaging the media the day before giving evidence to be questionable for someone who served the Indian judiciary at such a high level appointed to guard and protect the rule of law,” Goozee notes in his ruling.Despite being critical of the “trial by media” and its impact on the Modi case, the Westminster Magistrates’ Court judge expressed surprise that Katju, who was a Supreme Court judge from 2006 to 2011, took the “astonishing decision” to brief journalists concerning the evidence he was giving in the UK proceedings, “creating his own media storm and adding to the heightened media interest to date”.Goozee was also critical of former High Court judge Abhay Thipsay’s evidence, another defence witness who had been deposed as an expert on how the case would play out in the Indian courts.The UK judge noted that Thipsay had aligned himself with a political party (Congress) on his retirement and received adverse commentary in the media as a result, but that he also engaged with and courted the media himself.“Overall, these factors have the effect, in my assessment, of nullifying any weight I would have attached to his evidence,” the ruling notes.The UK judge, who found a prima facie case of fraud and money laundering against Modi in the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, further declared that there was no evidence which allowed him to find that if extradited the jeweller would be at “real risk of suffering a flagrant denial of justice” as pleaded by his lawyers.He accepted that the accused being a high-profile businessman who made a huge success of the Nirav Modi brand in India and worldwide was the target of “sensationalised” media reporting, but pointed out that such reporting is not unfamiliar to the courts even in the UK.“India is governed by its written constitution which has at its core the fundamental principle of the independence of the judiciary by virtue of the separation of powers between judiciary, the executive and the legislature. There is no cogent or reliable evidence that the judiciary in India are no longer independent, or capable of managing a fair trial even where it is a high-profile fraud with significant media interest,” the ruling says.The judge also highlighted how he had received 16 volumes of evidence from the Government of India, 16 bundles of expert reports and defence evidence and a total of 32 lever-arch folders of documents, all of which he has considered in his ruling.He was, however, extremely critical of the “poorly presented” documentation by the Indian authorities and stressed: “I hope the GOI take these observations on board in relation to future requests.”The judgment will now go to UK Home Secretary Priti Patel, who has two months to order extradition on the basis of the court’s findings.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/astonishing-inappropriate-uk-court-on-ex-sc-judge-katjus-testimony-in-nirav-modi-case-217766

The military hotline has been accepted by both sides and could replicate the arrangement on the western border with Pakistan.The Chinese Foreign Ministry said both sides had agreed to set up a communication hotline to exchange opinions in a “timely” manner.Releasing details of the 75-minute telephonic conversation on Thursday between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, the MEA said the two “discussed the situation along the LAC in eastern Ladakh and also issues related to overall India-China relations”.Jaishankar was upfront about China’s “provocative behaviour and unilateral attempts of the Chinese side to alter the status quo”.“The disturbance of peace and tranquillity, including by violence, will inevitably have a damaging impact on the relationship,” he told Wang, said an MEA read-out of the conversation.Jaishankar also sought disengagement and de-escalation as the first step towards restoring normalcy. “It was necessary to disengage at all friction points in order to contemplate de-escalation of forces in this sector. That alone will lead to restoration of peace and tranquillity and provide conditions for progress of our bilateral relationship.”The minister’s emphasis on normalcy as the basis for restoring bilateral ties appeared to counter Wang’s observations released by the Chinese Foreign Office which quoted him as saying that the “border issue is not the whole story of China-India relations, and should be placed in a proper position in their relationship”.Wang also said India had “vacillated and even moved backwards over its policy on China, which has affected and disrupted bilateral pragmatic cooperation”. The experience over the past few decades has repeatedly demonstrated that “acts of highlighting differences will not help resolve the issue, but erode the foundation of mutual trust”, he said.The two Foreign Offices had different takes on the disengagement process. Beijing suggested that the crisis had blown over with Wang stating that “both sides must cherish the current hard-won situation” but the MEA on Thursday described the disengagement around Pangong Lake last week as only “a significant first step”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-links-ties-to-normalcy-at-border-china-says-lac-issue-not-the-whole-story-217760
