The party rubbished speculations of Kumar possibly joining the ruling JD(U) in the state.Kanhaiya Kumar, also a former JNUSU president, had met the Minister Ashok Chaudhary who is a senior JD(U) leader, at the latter's residence in Patna, on Sunday.CPI head D Raja said the speculations in Kumar joining the JD(U) are unfounded."Even, we in the national Capital meet Union Ministers," Raja said, adding that leaders cutting across party lines do meet Ministers regarding people's problems."Kanhaiya Kumar is far too much wedded to Communist ideology to even think of joining any other political outfit," Raja told Tribune.Subsequently, the CPI stated that Kumar along with a CPI MLA Suryakant Paswan had met Chaudhary to discuss some people’s issues and development works in his assembly constituency."CPI condemns the mala fide and mischievous intentions of some sections of the media to malign the CPI and Kanhaiya Kumar," the party stated.Kumar had raised eyebrows in political circles by meeting the JD(U) leader.He was reportedly miffed after the CPI National Council in its meeting, held in Hyderabad last months, censured him for misbehaving with party's Bihar office secretary.Reports suggest he was also unhappy with his party for having aligned with the RJD in the last Assembly elections in Bihar.Kumar had unsuccessfully contested from Begusarai constituency in Bihar against Union Minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh in the 2019 General Election. He is credited with the view that the RJD put up a nominee which led to his defeat in the election.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cpi-defends-kanhaiya-kumars-meeting-with-nitish-aide-213275
16-02-2021||---||Contemplating measures to regulate OTT platforms, Centre tells SC||New Delhi, February 16The Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that it was contemplating certain measures to regulate Over the Top (OTT) platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.Acting on a PIL seeking OTT regulation by an autonomous body, a Bench led by Chief Justice SA Bobde asked the government to spell out its stand in six weeks even as Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj said the government was contemplating measures on the issue.The top court had on October 15 last issued notice to the Centre on a PIL seeking setting up of an autonomous body to regulate OTT platforms which provide paid film and television content to consumers via a high-speed Internet connection.It had asked the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and Internet and Mobile Association of India to respond to the PIL filed by advocate Shashank Shekhar Jha.The government had earlier told the court in the Sudarshan News case that there was a need to regulate digital media in India.Jha wanted the top court to direct the Government to set up a body for monitoring of content on different OTT/streaming and digital media platforms.“With cinemas theatres unlikely to open anytime soon in the country, OTT/Streaming and different digital media platforms have surely given a way out for filmmakers and artists to release their content without being worried about getting clearance certificates for their films and series from the censor board,” Jha submitted.He pointed out that there was no law or autonomous body governing the digital content to monitor and manage the content available to the public at large without any filter.None of the OTT/Streaming platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime, Zee5, and Hotstar have signed the self-regulation provided by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting since February 2020, the petitioner contended.“The government is facing heat to fill this lacuna with regulations from the public and the Judiciary; still the relevant government departments have not done anything significant to regularise these OTT/Streaming Platforms,” the petition read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/contemplating-measures-to-regulate-ott-platforms-centre-tells-sc-213273
16-02-2021||United Nations||UN peacekeeping missions should not operate in perpetuity: India||The UN peacekeeping missions should not operate in perpetuity and there is urgent need for time-bound exit strategies to ensure they do not become instruments for “furthering political interests”, India, one of the largest troop-contributing countries, has said.India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti said the current peacekeeping operations are multi-dimensional and are called upon to not only maintain peace and security but also to facilitate the political processes, protect civilians, disarm combatants, support elections, protect and promote human rights and restore the rule of law.“Peacekeeping missions are meant to be transitional measures and not operate in perpetuity. There is an urgent need for time-bound exit strategies to ensure that peacekeeping missions do not become instruments for furthering political interests,” he said at the General Debate on Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations on Monday.Highlighting India’s perspective on priority issues in UN peacekeeping, he said performance of peacekeeping operations should be measured in relation to political and operational realities, priorities set for implementing mandate, and adequacy and appropriateness of resources.Tirumurti said India has always voiced its support for the adoption of “No National Caveats Policy” at UN peacekeeping deployments.“India believes that a caveat, whether declared or undeclared, places additional burden on those who do not have any caveats besides having an impact on performance of peacekeepers in fulfilling their mandate and safety and security,” he said.India has always called for matching mandates with adequate resources, Tirumurti said, underlining that “an under-resourced, under-equipped mission, will not only result in underperformance in mandate implementation, but will impact the credibility of UN peacekeeping as a whole”.President of the UN General Assembly Volkan Bozkir said the COVID-19 pandemic has put additional challenges to the already complex peacekeeping operations. Peace operations are also supporting government-led efforts to both prevent and prepare for COVID-19 outbreaks at the country level.“Amidst these daunting challenges, it is essential that we provide peacekeeping operations with clearly defined mandates and realisable objectives, adequate resources based on a realistic assessment of the situation on the ground, as well as secure financing,” he said.Bozkir said it was crucial that the UN’s approach keeps pace with, and responds to, evolving challenges and new threats and opportunities.In this ever more complex and interconnected world, UN peace operations require constant refinement, drawing on analytical and operational capabilities, while leveraging new technology to increase their impact, he said.Tirumurti said that in the context of COVID-19, India was happy to respond to the request of UN Secretary-General and swiftly dispatch two medical teams and upgrade India’s peacekeeping hospitals in MONUSCO in Goma, DRC and in UNMISS in Juba, South Sudan.“We are working closely with our partners on the vaccine front also and make available our facilities for all humanity,” he said.India stressed that honest assessment and feedback for peacekeeping performance was essential to have an effective accountability system.“Assessing performance without determining accountability will leave us open to repeating errors,” Tirumurti said, adding that India supports the effective implementation of Integrated Performance Policy Framework, which covers all stakeholders and all phases of peacekeeping operations, and not just those on the ground.India strongly supports the SG’s Action for Peacekeeping (A4P) initiative, which requires sustained and effective follow-up and implementation and appreciates the Secretary-General’s attention to improving safety and security of UN peacekeeping personnel.“With rising incidents of attacks, including from terrorists, and rising casualties, we need to do more to ‘protect the protectors’,” he said.India, however, voiced concern over the non-payment of cost of service rendered by the Troop and Police Contributing Countries to the “closed” peacekeeping missions, saying this “unresolved” issue requires resolution and considered attention.According to a UN statement, Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix said the current session sends a powerful message in support of peacekeeping personnel facing complex challenges in the field amid the pandemic.Tirumurti asserted that India will push for the presence of more women in peacekeeping.With more than one million men and women having served under the UN flag in more than 70 peacekeeping operations over the past seven decades, Tirumurti recalled the “pioneering” efforts of India, especially the first all-women UN police peacekeeping contingent in Liberia – in the backdrop of “our own history of forming the first all-women Rani of Jhansi regiment of the Indian National Army of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose during India’s fight for independence.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/un-peacekeeping-missions-should-not-operate-in-perpetuity-india-213271
16-02-2021||New Delhi||ED attaches over Rs 17-cr assets of Amnesty International on money laundering charges||The Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday said it has attached over Rs 17 crore bank deposits in connection with its money laundering case against two entities of Amnesty International (India), the global human rights watchdog.The agency said in a statement that a provisional order has been issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) “attaching bank accounts of Amnesty International India Pvt Ltd (AIIPL) and Indians for Amnesty International Trust (IAIT)”.It said “both the entities have acquired the proceeds of crime and layered the same in the form of various movable properties. The order involves attachment of movable properties worth of Rs 17.66 crore being proceeds of crime”.This money laundering case of the ED is based on a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) FIR filed against AIIPL, IAIT, Amnesty International India Foundation Trust (AIIFT) and Amnesty International South Asia Foundation (AISAF) that was filed under various sections of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) and the Indian Penal Code (120-B which denotes criminal conspiracy).“Amnesty International India Foundation Trust (AIIFT) had been granted permission under the FCRA during 2011-12 for receiving foreign contribution from the Amnesty International UK,” it said.However, the statement said the same was cancelled on the basis of the “adverse” inputs received. “Since permission/registration has been denied to the said entity on the basis of adverse inputs received from security agencies during the year 2011-12, AIIPL and IAIT were formed in the year 2013-14 and 2012-13, respectively to escape the FCRA route and carried out NGO activities in the guise of service export and FDI,” the agency alleged.A probe found, the ED said, that upon cancellation of the FCRA licence by the Union government, Amnesty International India Foundation Trust and Amnesty entities adopted “new method” to receive money from abroad.The agency said Amnesty International, UK sent Rs 51.72 crore to AIIPL in the guise of export of services and the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).“For export proceeds/advances to Amnesty International UK there was no documentary proof, such as invoices and copies of agreement between AIIPL and Amnesty International UK, has been furnished by AIIPL to the authorised dealer (AD) banks.”“It is prima facie found that Amnesty International India Pvt Ltd and others have obtained foreign remittances to the tune of Rs 51.72 crore in the guise export of services and the FDI from Amnesty International (UK) whose source is the donations from individual donors,” the ED alleged.The agency has earlier attached some properties in this case and the total attachment value now stands at Rs 19.54 crore.

It also provides information on what one needs to do to address the issue. This might include information about petitions, details about protests and mass movements.Earlier, the Delhi Police had asked Google and some social media giants to provide information about email id, URLs and certain social media accounts related to the creators of the “toolkit” shared by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and others on Twitter in connection with the farmers’ protest.The Cyber Cell had lodged an FIR against “pro-Khalistan” creators of the “toolkit” for waging a “social, cultural and economic war against the government of India”.The case against unnamed persons was registered on charges of criminal conspiracy, sedition and various other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The “toolkit” was aimed at spreading disaffection and ill-will against the government of India and creating disharmony among various social, religious and cultural groups, the police had claimed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/toolkit-case-court-asks-delhi-police-to-give-fir-copy-to-disha-ravi-allows-her-to-talk-to-family-213251
16-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||Defying trends of La Nina year, day temperatures in Northwest soar above normal in February||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 16Defying expected trends of a La Nina year, day temperatures in Northwest India are recording way above the normal in February this year quite unlike the “severe and extended winter” predicted by meteorologists at the beginning of the season last year.As on date, the day temperatures are “markedly above normal (5.1°C or more)” at many places over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan and Muzaffarabad and West Rajasthan and “appreciably above normal (3.1°C to 5.0°C)” over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and East Rajasthan and also some parts of Haryana, Chandigarh, and Delhi.Minimum or night temperatures too are ruling “markedly above normal (5.1°C or more)” in parts of Punjab and West Rajasthan while many regions of the Northwest (including Hill States) and the Central India are “appreciably and above normal (3.1°C to 5.0°C)”. Though in plains yesterday the lowest minimum temperature of 6.6°C was recorded from Karnal.Mahesh Palawat of Skymet attributes the “increase in maximum temperatures since the beginning of February” to “lesser and feeble Western Disturbances”.“Usually in the Delhi-NCR the mercury touches the 30°C mark in the latter part of February. However, this year it has happened in the first half. There is no specific reason apart from the fact that the season has seen fewer and reduced intensity WDs, which mostly caused lighter and moderate snow and rains. Only when there is a high intensity WD that icy cold winds are generated. One can only blame climate change”.    Meanwhile, a fresh WD is likely to affect the Western Himalayan Region from night of February 19. Under its influence “isolated to scattered light rainfall/snowfall is likely over WHR,” according to the IMD.“However, the temperatures are not expected to drop drastically, that is certain. The February 19/20 WD will not be severe, so the winters are on the way out. A harsher and extended winter was expected this season due to various reasons, including the prevailing La Nina,” he said.Normally, La Nina conditions coincide with colder and extended winter. Around November IMD Director-General Mrityunjaya Mohapatra had also said “generally, during a La Nina year temperatures remain low but a lot depends upon regional factors, winds, etc”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defying-trends-of-la-nina-year-day-temperatures-in-northwest-soar-above-normal-in-february-213247

Delhi remains their focal point. The riots and illegal protests that took place in February 2020 were a part of this scheme.”Reddy further said: “On January 26, we witnessed how anti-India powers used farmers’ protest to disrupt the law and order situation in the National Capital.”The Minister, while appreciating the efforts of the Delhi Police, said: “The way you handled the riots and illegal protests are examples for other police forces.”He further said: “You also handled the January 26 violence with quite an appreciable restraint and tackled the situation very responsibly despite their anti-national active behaviour.”The northeast Delhi violence took place in February 2020, in which at least 53 people were killed and several others were injured. So far, over 250 charge sheets have been filed in the violence-related cases.On Republic Day, during the tractor march by farmers to protest against the three farm laws, protestors violated the agreement about the route to be taken and entered central Delhi after forcibly removing barricades.Several policemen were injured in the violence and vehicles were damaged.

16-02-2021||New Delhi||Women participation in Covid vaccination records up to 78%||The national data on the countrywide Covid immunisation programme has revealed that women have outnumbered men in availing the vaccine shots.The data extracted from the CoWIN application shows that the number of females inoculated with the vaccines so far is greater than the men in many states and union territories (UT)s.A gender-wise beneficiaries break-up sourced from the CoWIN dashboard showed that the trend of women getting more vaccinated went as high as 78 per cent in 28 out of 36 states and UTs. Besides, in many parts of the country, more than two-third of the vaccine beneficiaries remained female.In Lakshadweep, of the total vaccination accounted, 78.2 per cent was contributed by women alone. Similarly, it was calculated 75 per cent in Himachal pradesh, followed by Chhattisgarh (74.3), Kerala (74), Assam (73.8), Andaman and Nicobar islands (70), Ladakh (70), Sikkim, Mizoram (70), Bihar(69.5), Arunachal pradesh (69.5) and Meghalaya (68.15).As per the data, women seem to be more open to vaccination in these states and UTs since they constitute more than 2/3rd of the vaccine coverage here.Dr. Nand Kumar, professor, department of psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, said that at a first glance, it appears that the dominance of the female gender is driving the high ratio of being them the most beneficiaries of the vaccines."One immediate conclusion that could be drawn is that we have more female grassroots health workers than male workers. ASHAs, ANMs, Anganwadi workers are all women. Nurses, health professionals and paramedics are also predominantly women. So, if we look at the current priority of the government for vaccination, which is the healthcare workers, the numbers are bound to remain higher at the women's side," he said.However, Kumar added that if looked deeper, one can find the psyche of women which could also be driving their high participation in the immunization drive, i.e, their tendency to remain more secure in their lives."The women tend to remain more secure in life. All over the world, women prefer safety and security in all walks of life. Psychologically, they don't indulge in or adopt risk-taking behaviours. Being more health-conscious, less intake of alcohol or smoking, are few of the virtues to remain low at risk. This psyche drives them to be more open to the vaccination. Besides, they are quick in taking decisions as well and given a chance to build immunity against the Covid-19, they won't take much time to decide.However, could it be possible that the males are more unwilling to get the vaccination? Responding to it, Dr. Amulya K. Seth, psychologist, Columbia Asia Hospital, said that the gender imbalance in Covid-19 vaccination has more to do with women's psyche than the possibility of willingness and unwillingness for vaccination.He said that by nature, women are more careful about their own health as well as of the family, and this phenomenon could be resulting in better outcomes in women."Covid-19 as a disease has shown us the importance of being considerate about oneself as well as people around them. By nature, women fit this criteria more since traditionally they are the ones who take care of children and family, and are more careful about their own health for the sake of people they care for," Seth explained.He also said that the message that the Covid-19 vaccines provide protection to oneself as well as those around them has penetrated more among the women than men and should be probed so that a parity is maintained when the vaccines are rolled for the general public.So far, more than 8.5 million (87,20,822) doses of corona vaccine have been administered in India since the drive began on January 16 after approval for 'Covishield' and 'Covaxin'.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/women-participation-in-covid-vaccination-records-up-to-78-213197

Karajol, on behalf of the Canine Research and Information Centre (CRIC) in Bagalkot district of Karnataka.A senior IAF official said bird-hits are a big problem at several airbases. These hounds will be trained by experts to scare away the birds.“To address the problem of ground-dwelling birds such as lapwings and larks, IAF planned dog walking module. IAF chose to use a domestic breed as part of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat. Taking a cue from PM’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’ in which he had praised this breed, we decided to try the Mudhol hound. The qualities and temperament of this native breed were found suitable for bird scaring. The Air Force station here was selected as a pilot project. Depending on the success of the project, it will be extended to other stations,” the official said.Experts say that the breed is best known for its stamina, sharpness and agility. Mudhol Hounds are also known to be fiercely loyal to their owners and are excellent hunting dogs.These agile all-weather dogs that enjoy good health and require minimum grooming, have already been recruited by the Indian Army, CRPF, CISF, BSF, SSB, ITBP and the police departments of a few states.A few weeks ago, IAF officials placed an order for seven puppies. After completing all the formalities, four Mudhol hounds, and aged around three months have been handed to the IAF officials of Agra Air Force station. Another three puppies will be handed over after six months as per an agreement.The training of these Karnataka-origin hunting hounds first started in 2016 by the Army’s Remount and Veterinary Corps (RVC) centre in Meerut.The Mudhol hounds were bred by Ghorpade kings of Mudhol (now in Bagalkot in North Karnataka) in the 1920s, by crossing Persian and Turkish breeds with local dogs.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iaf-gets-desi-dogs-to-scare-away-birds-from-runways-213169

Thousands of people are cooking food, but the help of the workers and labourers is also being taken on a payment basis.The scene is similar at the Ghazipur border, where farmers themselves are preparing langars, but some tasks are being outsourced to others who are paid on a daily wages basis."I've been present in the farmers agitation for the last one month, earning Rs 300 every day by cutting vegetables and washing dishes," says Ashok a resident of Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh.

A gentleman who suddenly emerged from the crowd presented a cheque for Rs 50,000.The response from Ram bhakts is overwhelming," A T Elangovan, Hindu Munnani's Chennai president, said.According to K E Srinivasan, Chennai organiser of Dharma Jagran Manch  a wing of RSS  not only the affluent in the society but also the poor contributed."At Perambur, for instance, cobblers and other sections came forward to donate Rs 10," he said.At Kodungaiyur when the members solicited funds for the temple construction, shop keepers contributed their mite.An enthusiastic seller of vermilion (kumkum) near a temple, who happened to be a Muslim, gave Rs 200 for the cause.The Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam has already appealed to the devotees to donate liberally.Janakalyan, a spiritual and cultural service organisation, is utilising its office with several prominent personalities to contribute towards the initiative, its city secretary V Subramanian said.The Supreme Court in November 2019 settled the decades-old dispute and paved the way for the construction of a Ram Temple by a Trust at the disputed site at Ayodhya.It had then directed the Centre to allot an alternative 5-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a "prominent" place in the holy town in UP.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on August 5, 2020 laid the foundation stone for the construction of a grand temple at Ayodhya.

This tweet was widely covered by media houses across the country,” said the complaint.Also read: Delhi Police write to Zoom, seek details of those who attended toolkit meeting ahead of R-Dayदेश विरोध का बीज जिसके भी दिमाग में हो उसका समूल नाश कर देना चाहिए फिर चाहे वह #दिशा_रवि हो यां कोई और ।  Campaign Against Hate Speech said Vij’s tweet, which literally translates to “Whosoever has the seed of anti-nationalism in their minds should be completely exterminated, whether it’s Disha Ravi or someone else”, is an “open call for extermination and encounter of all people who he thinks are “anti-national” and especially Disha Ravi who is an accused in an ongoing investigation.”Also read: Disha Ravi’s arrest made in accordance with law, says Delhi Police chiefThe complaint said that by asking for such extermination of people who Vij thinks have “seeds of anti-nationalism in their minds”, the Minister is directly attacking the constitutional provisions of Right to life and dignity under Article 21 and Right to liberty under Article 19 of the Constitution.“By calling for the extermination of the so-called “anti-nationals”, he is inciting violence against individuals that could lead to bodily harm or even loss of life. He is promoting enmity and inciting actions prejudicial to the peace and harmony of the nation. His open call for the extermination of people is intended to provoke breach of peace and intentionally insult Disha Ravi,” it added.The complaint added that the Minister is duty-bound to respect and abide by the Constitution which he has “conveniently forgotten” in his criminal intimidation of a 22-year-old activist and others.“The minister has wilfully ignored the concept of due process of law by calling for the extermination of an “accused” who is yet to undergo a trial. The tweet has been widely shared and continues to be shared even as this complaint is being drafted. In this regard, we seek that FIR under Section 153A, 503, 504, 505, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 be registered against Anil Vij for unconstitutional, criminally intimidating, hateful statements calling for open encounters on the social media platform Twitter,” it added. —ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-based-group-files-complaint-against-anil-vij-for-hateful-tweet-against-disha-ravi-213159

The SKM also showed anger over the ‘misuse’ of police power by the government in its efforts to weaken the farmers’ agitation.Farmer leaders held formal discussions at the ‘kisan andolan office’ in Kundli to intensify the farmers’ protest and mobilise more people in their support.The SKM said India’s young environmentalists understood and appreciated that unviable farming led to unsustainable farming.It was not surprising that farmers ended up adopting desperate and unsustainable practices to make ends meet when farming got riskier due to increasingly adverse markets, which was compounded by climate change, said farmer leader Darshan Pal.He said legal guarantee of MSP for all crops would help farmers diversify and pave the way for a lasting solution to straw burning, which was linked to soil degradation, air pollution and health risks.Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana protested against the three farm laws. Some farmer leaders went from trolley to trolley for the second consecutive day to mobilise the protesting farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/samyukt-kisan-morcha-condemns-arrest-of-environmentalist-disha-ravi-213038

Both accused are reportedly absconding.Edit: The arrest of Disha RaviLaptops seized; Nikita moves High CourtWhat cops claimThe NBW against the duo came a day after Delhi cops took Bengaluru-based climate activist Disha Ravi (22) into custody, triggering a social media storm. After Thunberg shared the toolkit professing support for the agitating farmers, the Delhi Police lodged an FIR for sedition and criminal conspiracy against “creators of the toolkit”. The police have all along alleged that the toolkit was created in collaboration with Khalistani groups.Nikita Jacob, who has absconded, according to the police, approached the Bombay High Court, seeking protection against her impending arrest. The HC will hear her plea tomorrow even as her lawyers said she had been cooperating and there was no reason for the NBW.The Delhi Police, however, says all three accused, including Disha, were acting at the behest of pro-Khalistani group Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF), headed by one MO Dhaliwal.Delhi Police Joint Commissioner (cyber cell) Prem Nath today said a Canada-based woman named Puneet connected Nikita, Disha and Shantanu with the PJF and they held a zoom meeting on January 11.Nath said Google document “Global Farmer Strike” and “Global Day of Action, January 26” was created after the meeting.“On February 4, we came across a Google document toolkit. We found it was created by PJF,” Nath said, adding that one portion of the document mentioned action points and prior actions — digital strike through hashtags on January 26, tweet storm from January 23 onwards and physical action on January 26, the day Indian farmers were to hold a tractor rally in the Capital.Shantanu, through his email account, was the owner of the toolkit, Nath said.Delhi cops said a search was conducted at Nikita’s Mumbai residence in her absence and two laptops and a phone were seized. “Incriminating evidence has been retrieved,” cops said.“Nikita, Shantanu and Disha collaborated to draft the toolkit. Based on the evidence gathered from Nikita’s devices, teams were sent to Maharashtra’s Beed district and Bengaluru,” Nath said. He rejected allegations that due process was not followed in Disha’s arrest.The Delhi Police clarified that Disha Ravi was arrested in the presence of her mother and local police, and her lawyer was informed about the arrest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/toolkit-warrant-against-two-activists-212968

Priyanka tweeted, “Those with guns are afraid of a girl who has no weapons. A girl without arms has spawned courage all around.”The AAP and RJD also demanded the release of Disha.US Vice-President Kamala Harris’ niece Meena Harris also tweeted in support of Disha, saying: “I feel very sad.

It is a massive step in our vision for Aatmanirbhar Bharat. — Narendra Modi, PMThe government today deregulated the sector, ending its own 250-year-old colonial era monopoly in the area with Prime Minister Narendra Modi describing the move as a massive push to the national goal of self-reliance.The Guidelines for Acquiring and Producing Geospatial Data and Geospatial Data Services, including maps, acknowledge that maps and other accurate geospatial data are crucial for national infrastructure projects like linkages of rivers, creation of industrial corridors and deploying smart power systems. “From creation of maps to their dissemination, Indian firms were hitherto required to seek licences and follow cumbersome procedures of permissions,” Science Minister Harsh Vardhan said.The government said emerging vibrant technologies like e-commerce, autonomous drones, delivery and urban transport require a massive leap in mapping with greater depths, resolution and precision for which deregulation was necessary.The guidelines place some restrictions on the marking of sensitive attributes (such as strategic locations) on maps, but there is no restriction on surveying or mapping any area as long as it is physically accessible. High-spatial accuracy geospatial data finer than 1 metre horizontally and 3 metres vertically can, however, only be acquired and owned by Indian entities and stored in India.“Data of accuracy coarser than that is globally available through satellites and has hence not been regulated. Also finer data such as data needed to predict disasters can be licensed for foreign entities also but these entities cannot own that data,” the guidelines say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/now-easy-access-to-geospatial-data-maps-212970

Kanhaiya met Choudhary on Sunday.During his failed bid for the Lok Sabha in 2019, the former student leader had avoided attacking Nitish who had come out in support of Kanhaiya amid the JNU controversy in 2016. The JD(U) was then not a part of the BJP-led NDA.Choudhary’s meeting with Kanhaiya, a staunch communist, comes at a time when the charismatic young politician is said to have been left mortified by a censure motion against him by the CPI recently. There has been tension between the aspiring leader and his party during the Lok Sabha elections when the CPI reportedly insisted that he shared part of funds raised through crowd-funding.Kanhaiya fought from his home constituency Begusarai, where he lost to Union Minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh with a massive margin.Sources close to Kanhaiya and Choudhary insisted that it was a “non-political” meeting. Subhash Singh (BJP), a state minister, called the former JNUSU president a “lunatic” and said his meeting with a seniorJD (U) leader was “not appropriate”.

As per the authorities, 149 persons are yet to be traced. Officials said the rescue work at the Tapovan tunnel and Raini village area was hit following light showers and snowfall.Last-ditch effortA senior ITBP official said: “We are waiting for the weather to improve to resume the search operation.” He said the rescue teams had so far managed to clear sludge up to 150 metres of the 180-metre-long tunnel.Officials said the other approach to reach the trapped workers — by widening a hole drilled into the tunnel system — did not appear to be working. A camera or tube could not be inserted as the hole was choked with sludge, they said. Rescuing the trapped people was now possible only with the help of excavators, Chamoli District Magistrate Swati S Bhadauria said.The body of Satypal Singh Bartwal from Masoli village in Chamoli district was among those found in the tunnel on Monday. “We had hoped Satyapal would return alive. But now we will have to return home with his body. It is unbearable,” said his elder brother.Officials said connectivity had been restored in all affected regions of the Tapovan and Raini areas. The last rites of those pulled out dead are being carried out after samples are taken for DNA tests to help establish their identity. Kits with foodgrain and other essentials have been distributed among residents of over a dozen villages that were cut off from the district headquarters after the disaster, possibly triggered by an avalanche.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hope-fades-as-rain-snow-hit-rescue-149-still-missing-212977

Now we have to go to Sri Lanka and Nepal." The Chief Minister said the BJP would form government in West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and the party would remain in power in Tripura for 30 years as the CPI-M would be finished in the next assembly elections in 2023."The BJP is the largest party in India now. It has maximum numbers of MPs, MLAs and other elected members," Deb said. The BJP, however, also supported the Chief Minister's views. Party spokesman Nabendu Bhattacharjee said that not only Sri Lanka and Nepal, the BJP's philosophy is being extended in many Asian and African countries."Our targets and plans are not to form governments in those states. Our "Pracharaks" (functionaries) are broadening BJP's philosophy and belief in those states. If the people of those countries accept our principles and viewpoints then the future course of action would be shaped," Bhattacharjee told the media on Monday.Sharply criticising the Chief Minister's announcement, Communist Party of India-Marxist central committee member Jitendra Chowdhury said that Deb's speech is a combination of arrogance and ignorance.Chowdhury, a former Tripura Minister, said that Deb's speech in a public forum portrayed the approach and method of governance that was prevailing in Tripura after the BJP-IPFT (Indigenous People's Front of Tripura) alliance came to power three years ago."The BJP-led governments both at the Centre and the states have forcefully muted all kinds of civil liberties, freedom of speech and all pillars of democracy while a total lawlessness has been prevailing in Tripura."It has been revealed further from Deb's speech that the top brass in BJP is engaged in the internal affairs of our neighbouring countries, which is contrary to our long cherished foreign policy since independence," the veteran tribal leader and former Lok Sabha member said.He alleged that it is extremely unfortunate that this same BJP and their governments have brought sedition charges against the innocent citizens to silence the dissent voices, and octogenarian Varavara Rao, Gautam Navlakha and teen ager Disha Ravi like people are not spared.Tripura Congress Vice-President Tapas Dey said that Deb's comments with reference to Sri Lanka and Nepal are against the foreign policies of India.

16-02-2021||Patna||Kanhaiya meets Nitish aide, sets tongues wagging in NDA||Many eyebrows were raised in Bihar on Monday as news broke of a meeting between CPI’s rising star Kanhaiya Kumar and Ashok Choudhary, a minister and key aide of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.A fiery former JNU student leader, who has of late is being seen as veering towards Nitish Kumar despite their parties rarely getting on the same page on most issues, Kanhaiya met Choudhary on Sunday.Choudhary had headed the state unit of the JD(U) during the assembly elections and played an instrumental role recently in enlisting the support of the sole BSP MLA Zama Khan and independent legislator Sumit Singh, both of whom were inducted into the cabinet last week.He had also caused jitters in the LJP, an ally turned adversary, by inviting its sole MLA Raj Kumar Singh to his residence for a book launch function a few weeks back.Choudhary’s meeting with Kanhaiya, a staunch communist, came at a time when the charismatic young politician is said to have been left mortified by a censure motion that the CPI recently passed against him.The party action had followed alleged manhandling of a key CPI official attached to the state headquarters here.Earlier, there had been tensions between the aspiring leader and his party during the Lok Sabha elections when the CPI reportedly insisted that he share a part of money he had raised through crowd-funding.Kanhaiya had fought from his home constituency Begusarai, where he lost to Union minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh by a massive margin.Nonetheless, the contest had created a lot of buzz and brought many celebrities from far-off places to the dusty town in support of the young leader who has been slapped with a sedition case for allegedly raising anti-national slogans at JNU.Sources close to Kanhaiya as well as Choudhary insisted that it was a “non-political” meeting and that both have known each other for long.It has, nonetheless, evoked reactions from those holding strong views on nationalism and against the so-called “tukde tukde gang”.Subhash Singh, a state minister from the BJP quota, called the former JNUSU president a “lunatic” (paagal) and said his meeting with a senior leader of an alliance partner was “not appropriate” (theek nahin hai).Ajay Alok, a JD(U) spokesman, reacted “Kahaiya shall be welcome into our party if he chooses to give up his perverse (vikrit) ideology.”Kanhaiya is also understood to have been disappointed with his party’s decision to side with the RJD, which had queered the pitch for him in the Lok Sabha polls by fielding its candidate, and acknowledge Tejashwi Yadav as undisputed leader of the five-party Grand Alliance.Yadav, who has for all practical purposes inherited the legacy of his father and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, is said to be wary of the former student leader who is of the same age but exhibits superior oratorical skills and grasp of issues.Some in the ruling alliance said on condition of anonymity that the meeting could have been yet another attempt by the JD(U) to raise its stock after its unsatisfactory performance in the assembly elections.A few hours after Kanhaiya’s meeting with Choudhary, Chandan Kumar Singh, an LJP MP, called on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.JD(U) spokesman Rajiv Ranjan Prasad latched on the development to berate the LJP, saying “Chirag Paswan has been alleging that his constituency of Jamui has been neglected and there has been no progress in Bihar at all. The meeting between his party MP and the chief minister is a rebuff to his brand of politics”.The LJP sought to downplay the significance of the meeting.“Our respected MP must have met the chief minister with regard to development works in his constituency. We wonder what is there to be so excited about,” LJP spokesman Ashraf Ansari said in a video statement.Paswan had pulled out of the NDA ahead of the assembly polls, vowing to decimate the JD(U) and help the BJP seize power.He fielded candidates against all JD(U) nominees, many of them rebels from the saffron party, a strategy that cost Nitish Kumar’s party dear and reduced it to the status of a junior partner to the BJP in the state for the first time.

16-02-2021||New Delhi||Disha, Nikita, Shantanu created ‘toolkit’; Greta was coaxed to act on it: Delhi Police||Climate activist Disha Ravi along with Mumbai lawyer Nikita Jacob and Pune engineer Shantanu created the “toolkit” related to the farmers’ agitation and shared it with others to tarnish India’s image, the Delhi Police said on Monday.The police claimed that Disha Ravi, who was arrested on Saturday from Bengaluru, sent the “toolkit” to teen climate activist Greta Thunberg through the Telegram app, and also “coaxed her to act on it”.The data was also deleted, police said, adding that Disha’s Telegram account shows many links related to the “toolkit” were removed.Non-bailable warrants have been issued against Nikita and Shantanu for allegedly creating the “toolkit”, the Delhi Police said.Addressing a press conference, Joint Commissioner of Police (Cyber) Prem Nath said 22-year-old Disha also deleted a WhatsApp group she created to spread the “toolkit” which was a dynamic document with hyperlinks to Google docs, a lot of which are ‘pro-Khalistani”.“The toolkit was aimed at tarnishing the image of India,” he said.Shantanu is a resident of Maharashtra’s Beed district and did his engineering from Pune, police said.Thunberg had shared the “toolkit” to lend her support to the farmers’ agitation against the three farm reform laws. In the document, various urgent actions, including creating a Twitter storm and protesting outside Indian embassies, were listed which were needed to be taken to support the farmers’ protest.The “toolkit” has been cited by some critics as a “proof” of her conspiracy to fuel protests in India.Earlier this month, the Cyber Cell had lodged an FIR against “pro-Khalistani” creators of the “toolkit” for waging a “social, cultural and economic war against the Government of India”.The case was registered on charges of criminal conspiracy, sedition and various other sections of the Indian Penal Code.“The email account created by Shantanu is the owner of this Google document,” Nath said, adding that “pro-Khalistani group Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) founder Mo Dhaliwal had contacted them through a Canada-based woman named Punit.”Before the Republic Day violence, that left 500 police personnel injured and a protestor dead, Nikita and Shantanu had on January 11 attended a Zoom meeting organized by PFJ in which modalities were decided to create the “toolkit” titled “Global Farmer Strike” and “Global Day of Action, 26 January”, Nath said.“Nikita, Shantanu, Disha and others collaborated towards the draft of the toolkit. Based on information gathered from Nikita and her device, several teams were sent to Maharashtra’s Beed district and to Bengaluru. Shantanu wasn’t found at his house in Beed and we are still searching for him,” he said.Police said Disha, Shantanu and Nikita created and edited the “toolkit”. Disha, who is also associated with the environmental movement called ‘Fridays for Future’, “sent the toolkit to Greta Thunberg through the Telegram app and also coaxed her to act on it.”      Disha Ravi was arrested in the presence of her mother, area station house officer (SHO) in Bengaluru. All due procedures were followed, he said.During a search of Nikita’s house on February 11, two laptops and an iPhone were found along with several “incriminating documents”, police said.“Keeping in mind that the person whose premises was being searched as per court order was a woman, the investigating team wound up the day’s search and requested Nikita to make herself available at her house on the next morning. She gave a written undertaking to be present at her house,” Nath said.Nikita is still absconding, he said.Police said they are also probing the role of a man named Peter Friedrich in connection with the “toolkit” case.Police said Friedrich has been on the radar of the Indian security establishments since late 2006 when he was noticed in the company of Bhajan Singh Bhinder alias Iqbal Chaudhary.“He (Bhinder) has been a very leading proponent of the K2 desk of ISI. Friedrich was associated with him,” police said.“Why his (Friedrich) name is there on the document or why should he (Friedrich) be followed will be answered by Disha and her associates. Did they contact Friedrich through Mo Dhaliwal or directly contact him is a matter of investigation,” a senior police officer said.Thousands of farmers protesting the Centre”s new agri laws had clashed with the police during their tractor parade on January 26.Their parade had dissolved into unprecedented scenes of anarchy as protesters fought with police, overturned vehicles and delivered a national insult hoisting a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort, a privilege reserved for India”s tricolour. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disha-nikita-shantanu-created-toolkit-greta-was-coaxed-to-act-on-it-delhi-police-212782
16-02-2021||Dehradun||Hopes dashed, kin of Uttarakhand victims cling to prayer, miracles||As rescuers started recovering bodies from a tunnel of the disaster-hit Tapovan project in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, all hopes of any survivors have been virtually dashed.But for many people, there is still a ray of hope. They are relying on miracles and prayers thinking their loved ones might come back alive from the debris and sludge inside the packed tunnel."We will not leave hope till we see something. Miracles do happen," said Hari Singh of Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh, whose nephew Tripan Singh is missing. Singh, who is camping in Tapovan area, says he is holding prayers regularly.Gloomy scenes were witnessed when family members started identifying the corpses."With a very heavy heart, we ask the family members to identify these bodies," said Yashwant Chauhan, Superintendent of Police (SP) Chamoli, who is closely monitoring the rescue operations.Family members of Alam Singh Pundir had been regularly praying at Loyal village in Tehri district since Feb 7 when the deluge struck. The moment the phone call came from Tapovan informing about the recovery of the body of Pundir, a pall of gloom gripped his family members with his old mother Manjhi Devi fainting and wife Sarojani Devi becoming inconsolable. Pundir has left behind four daughters. DGP Ashok Kumar said the post-mortem reports of most of the bodies have indicated that the floods did not give much time to the people inside. "They may have died immediately after the floods hit the tunnel," said Kumar.Nearly 200 people went missing after the Feb 7 morning deluge. This is the first time since the Feb 7 floods that the rescuers have been able to find bodies inside the tunnel. "We are expecting more bodies as there is little hope for survivors," admitted a top official. There is still no contact with the remaining people trapped inside.The rescuers are working on two places: one inside the tunnel and other at the remains of the Rishiganga project in Reni village. They have stopped the drilling process inside the tunnel, said Superintendent of Police (SP) Chamoli.As the bodies started recovering from the debris inside the tunnel, rescuers are slowly digging the tunnel so that bodies should not get hammered and are dug out intact.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hopes-dashed-kin-of-uttarakhand-victims-cling-to-prayer-miracles-212775
16-02-2021||New Delhi||India deregulates map-making, huge push to self-reliance plan, says PM||India on Monday deregulated the map-making and geospatial data generation, distribution and storage sector in a bid to provide a fillip to the self-reliant nation initiative.The plan is to allow the Indian private sector to make and publish maps with geospatial features and help in the application of the space technology in improving outcomes in a range of sectors from farming and infrastructure to disaster mapping.Maps and accurate geospatial data are crucial for national infrastructure projects such as linkages of rivers, creation of industrial corridors and deploying smart power systems.Emerging vibrant technologies like Digital India, Smart Cities, eCommerce, autonomous drones, delivery, logistics and urban transport require a leap forward in mapping with greater depth, resolution and precision. In every economic endeavour, spanning agriculture, finance, construction, mining and local enterprise, India’s farmers, small businesses and corporations alike stand to gain tremendously from the application of innovative technologies based on modern geospatial data technologies and mapping services.The reforms will unlock tremendous opportunities for our country’s start-ups, private sector, public sector and research institutions to drive innovations and build scalable solutions. This will also generate employment and accelerate economic growth. #Freedom2MapIndia pic.twitter.com/OoN1rDTwoW  The existing regime, however, imposed significant restrictions on the mapping industry - from creation to dissemination of maps, requiring Indian companies to seek licenses, follow a cumbersome system of pre-approvals and permissions. Compliance with these regulatory restrictions has subjected startups in India to unnecessary red tape, hindering Indian innovation in map technologies for decades, Science minister Harsh Vardhan said announcing the liberalisation of the sector today.The government said the move would help India realise the vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ and the goal of a 5 trillion-dollar economy.Our government has taken a decision that will provide a huge impetus to Digital India. Liberalising policies governing the acquisition and production of geospatial data is a massive step in our vision for an Aatmanirbhar Bharat. #mapmakingsimplified https://t.co/ssbPhAeSp1“For this to happen the regulations that apply to geospatial data and maps henceforth stand radically liberalised. The Department of Science and Technology is announcing sweeping changes to India’s mapping policy, specifically for Indian companies. What is readily available globally does not need to be restricted in India and therefore geospatial data that used to be restricted will now be freely available in India. Furthermore, Indian corporations and innovators are no longer subject to restrictions nor do they require prior approvals before they collect, generate, prepare, disseminate, store, publish, update digital Geospatial Data and Maps within the territory of India,” the geospatial data guidelines say.Indian startups and mapping innovators will be trusted to self-certify, apply good judgement and be relied upon to demonstrate adherence to guidelines. Also, measures to promote the development of Indian geospatial innovations that take advantage of the latest map-making technologies are proposed. With the next generation of mapping technology just about coming into its own around the world, this policy will enable Indian innovators to create substantial advances in mapping ultimately making our lives easier and empowering small businesses. Geospatial data sector is estimated to be a one lakh crore industry by 2030.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-deregulates-map-making-huge-push-to-self-reliance-plan-says-pm-212756
16-02-2021||Mumbai||Toolkit case: Lawyer, green activist move HC for transit bail||An advocate and an environmental activist on Monday moved the Bombay High Court seeking transit anticipatory bail after they were named as suspects in a case filed by the Delhi police with regard to the “toolkit” shared by climate activist Greta Thunberg over the farmers’ protest.Advocate Nikita Jacob and environmental activist Shantanu Muluk, both Maharashtra residents, filed separate pleas in the HC, which will hear them on Tuesday, after a Delhi court issued non-bailable warrants against them in the case.According to the Delhi police, the duo was allegedly involved in preparing the document and was in direct touch with “pro-Khalistani elements”.While Jacobs plea was filed in the principal HC seat in Mumbai, Muluk, a resident of Beed district in central Maharashtra, submitted his application in the Aurangabad bench of the High Court.Jacob’s plea seeking urgent hearing was mentioned before the Bombay HC’s single bench of Justice P D Naik on Monday. The HC said it would hear her plea on Tuesday.Muluk’s plea was mentioned before Justice Vibha Kankanvadi of the Aurangabad bench and his application would also be heard on Tuesday.Both the pleas sought transit anticipatory bail for a period of four weeks so that the applicants (Jacob and Muluk) can approach the court concerned in Delhi to apply for pre-arrest bail.Jacob and Muluk, in their pleas, have claimed they are targets of political vendetta.Jacob, in her plea, said she is unaware whether she has been named as an accused or a witness in the case.“However, the applicant (Jacob) fears that she may be arrested due to political vendetta and media trial,” her application said.Muluk, in his plea filed through advocate Satej Jadhav, said he and others are not actual dissenters but have only come out in support of farmers agitating on Delhi borders for more than two months now against the Centre’s new agri-marketing laws.Vendetta has tricked down from politics to the house of a common man making a mockery of the rights and principles enshrined in the Constitution of India, the application said.Jacob, in her plea, said the FIR registered in the case was “false and baseless” and that she has already cooperated with the cyber cell of the Delhi police and recorded her statement.“Some entity named Legal Rights Observatory appears to have filed a false and baseless complaint with the Delhi police and seeks to pin the blame for violence on January 26, 2021 (during tractor rally in Delhi) upon the applicant as well,” the plea said.As per the application, on February 11, a team of Delhi police came to Jacob’s house in Goregaon area of Mumbai with a search warrant and seized documents and electronic gadgets.“The applicant has no religious, political or financial motive or agenda for researching, discussing, editing and circulating communication packs/toolkits for raising awareness, let alone to incite violence, riots and/or cause any other physical harm,” the application said.It said Jacob was a practising advocate in the Bombay High Court who volunteers for environmental causes.“The applicant was deeply concerned about the recent farm laws and villainising of farmers,” the application said.It said Jacob’s personal information and details are being circulated on social media.The application further said “absolute lies” are being spread to incite hate and violence against Jacob by claiming she has ties with political parties like the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).Muluk, in his application, said he and his colleagues are innocent and at the most have been kept in the dark by one notorious stake holder, but that cannot take away the bonafide intentions of the applicant.The Delhi police on Saturday arrested 21-year-old environmental activist Disha Ravi from Bengaluru in connection with the case.She was on Sunday produced before a Delhi court which remanded her in police custody for five days.The Delhi case stems from the “toolkit” shared by Thunberg, the Swedish teenage climate activist, to lend her support to the protesting farmers.Thousands of farmers protesting the new agriculture laws clashed with the police during their tractor parade on January 26.Earlier, the Delhi police had asked Google and some social media giants to provide information about e-mail ID, URLs and certain social media accounts related to creators of the “toolkit” shared by Thunberg and others on Twitter in connection with the farmers’ protest. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/toolkit-case-lawyer-green-activist-move-hc-for-transit-bail-212738

Swara Bhaskar tweeted in support of Ravi.#ReleaseDishaRavi https://t.co/AtynglMLxr  Kavita Krishnan, the secretary of All India Progressive Women’s Association, said people like Ravi are India’s best hope because they are concerned about not just themselves, but the future generations.“We are not behaving like a democracy right now. If we are going to equate protest with conspiracy and organising protests as conspiracy, then you are not a democracy anymore,” she said.“They should immediately drop this case based upon absolutely flimsy, ridiculous and evil pretext. A toolkit is not sedition, it is not conspiracy, toolkit is for protest,” she added.Rights activist Shabnam Hashmi also questioned the basis of Ravi’s arrest, saying anybody even doing a local campaign prepares a toolkit.“We should look at the prime minister’s campaign toolkit. We are crossing the limits of absurdity. We will become a laughing stock internationally,” she said.              Sunita Narain, head of the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, also extended her support to the arrested activist.“We know #climatechange is an existential threat.

But this will not stop us from fighting for our planet and future,” Kangujam tweeted.In a joint statement, more than 50 academics, artists and activists voiced support for Ravi and called her arrest “disturbing,” “illegal in nature” and an “over-reaction of the State”.        The statement issued under the banner of ‘Coalition for Environmental Justice in India’ also called it an attempt to distract the public.“It is also becoming increasingly clear that the current actions of the central government are diversionary tactics to distract people from real issues like the ever-rising cost of fuel and essential items, widespread unemployment and distress caused due to the lockdown without a plan, and the alarming state of the environment,” it said.An online petition has also been started by the group  demanding the immediate release of the climate activist.Environmentalist Vikrant Tongad said the incident will be demotivational for climate activists.“We cannot go on the merit of the case as the probe is ongoing, but the incident will be demotivational for climate activists...,” he said.       Greta Thunberg, a teen climate activist, had shared the “toolkit” to lend her support to the farmers agitation against the three farm reform laws.
