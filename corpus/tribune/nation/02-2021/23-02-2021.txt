In a series of tweets, the Prime Minister thanked Gujarat for “clearly showing the unwavering faith of the people towards politics of development and good governance”.“Thank you Gujarat! results of municipal elections across the state clearly show the unwavering faith people have towards politics of development and good governance.“Grateful to the people of the state for trusting BJP yet again. Always an honour to serve Gujarat. I would like to appreciate the efforts of each and every Karyakarta of BJP Gujarat.“Today’s win across Gujarat is very special. For a party that is serving in a state for over two decades to record such a phenomenal win is noteworthy. It is heartening to see widespread support from all sections of society, particularly the youth of Gujarat towards BJP who reached out to people and elaborated on our Party’s vision for the state. The Gujarat government’s pro-people policies have positively impacted the entire state,” the PM said in a series of tweets.Coming amid the ongoing farmers’ agitation against, the BJP is viewing the results as an endorsement of the three controversial laws, especially after the drubbing it received in Punjab’ local bodies polls. The BJP retained power in the six municipal corporations, winning 489 of the total 576 seats (as per figures posted by Nadda),Nadda attributed the “historic win” to the “complete faith, belief and devotion” of all sections, including villages, poor, farmers, traders, women, and youth” in Prime Minister Modi. Nadda and Shah also thanked the people, the party' cadres and the State leadership, CM Vijay Rupani, Deputy CM Nitinbhai Patel and state president CR Patil.  All these bodies are currently governed by the BJP.  While the BJP has an upper hand in elections to urban local bodies, this time, several senior and multiple term corporators were denied tickets, leading to disquiet in the party. Sources say Shah monitored the elections closely. While Congress won some seats, in these elections the surprise package appeared to be the Aam Adami Party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mc-polls-pm-modi-shah-nadda-thank-cadres-people-of-gujarat-216553

23-02-2021||New Delhi||‘Pagdi Sambhal Diwas’ celebrated at Delhi borders||Farmers organised “Pagdi Sambhal Diwas” on Tuesday at the Delhi borders to register their opposition to the government’s three agricultural laws.Wearing colourful turbans, the agitating farmers at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders, celebrated the day following a call by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha. The move is to assert the self-respect of farmers in memory of ‘Chacha’ Ajit Singh, the uncle of iconic revolutionary Bhagat Singh and founder of the “Pagdi Sambhal” movement.  The song “Pagdi Sambhal”, written by Banke Dayal, was a precursor to the peasant movement against agricultural laws by the colonial British government, in 1906. The reflections of the movement that Chacha Ajit Singh had started at that time can be observed in this farmers’ movement as well.  Reinforcing their demands, the farmer leaders said, “The government will have to withdraw these laws and remove the misconception that the farmers will go back.” Farmers’ organisations have decided to observe different days with varying themes to boost and strengthen their agitation. On Wednesday, ‘Anti-Suppression Day’ will be observed in which “repression” on the farmers’ movement will be opposed. On this day, memorandums will be submitted to the President at all tehsils and district headquarters.On the completion of three months on February 26, the contribution of the youth will be celebrated as “Yuva Kisan Diwas”. On this day all the forums will be run by the youth. Youths from different states have been told to reach the Delhi borders.Also, “Mazdoor Kisan Ekta Divas” will be celebrated on February 27 on the martyrdom day of Guru Ravidas and Chandrashekhar Azad.

23-02-2021||Baghpat (UP)||Business rivalry led to ‘chaat’ brawl in Baghpat||A man, affectionately called ‘uncle’ who is the one behind the ‘chaat’ rivalry in Baraut town in Baghpat on Monday that left 12 injured and eight in police custody, has said that he was ‘undeniably peeved’ because a rival ‘chaat’  seller was telling people that he sold stale food items.Uncle, whose real name is Harvinder, told reporters on Tuesday, that his rivals — most of them new entrants in the business — kept telling people not to visit Harvinder’s shop because Harvinder sold stale stuff.“I will tolerate anything but not if one casts aspersions on the business. I have been here for years and people travel long distance for ‘Uncle ji ki chaat’,” he said.The video clips of the brawl in Baraut that went viral on the social media show a frizzy red-haired portly man who is seen in the brawl giving it as much as he got it — a kick for a kick and a hit for a hit.The ‘chaat’ brawl ended in the police station where the warring groups were seated alongside without showing any signs of hostility that was evident earlier.Harvinder said, “These new chaat sellers always try to steal my customers instead of building up their own loyal customers. My other friends, who are local vendors, joined me in the fight.” The two groups, armed with iron rods and sticks, had brutally beaten up each other on the road.The bizarre fight continued for about 20 minutes before it was stopped.

23-02-2021||New Delhi||Agitating farmer unions object to Delhi Police posters at Tikri protest site||Agitating farmer union on Tuesday objected to Delhi Police putting posters that allegedly warned off protesters at the Tikri border site, even as the force claimed these were not new and only informed the protesters that they would not be allowed to enter the national capital.In a statement, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmer unions that is spearheading the ongoing agitation against the three agri laws, said it is opposed to the police’s move as the protesters were exercising their constitutional right and appealed to the farmers to continue their sit-in peacefully.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points --- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur --- for nearly 90 days, demanding a complete repeal of the three agri laws and a legal guarantee on Minimum Support Price for crops.“The Delhi Police has placed some posters at the Tikri border protest site where farmers have been warned that they will have to vacate the area. Such posters are irrelevant as farmers have been staging a peaceful protest by exercising their constitutional rights....“We will oppose the conspiracy to end the protest with these kinds of threats and warnings,” the SKM said in the statement.In the posters, the police have not given any deadline to the protesting farmers to vacate the area.On its part, the Delhi Police said it is a “routine” process.“The posters were pasted at the border area after the protest started. It is a routine exercise. Police have conveyed to them through posters that they are sitting in the jurisdiction of Haryana and they are not allowed to enter the national capital unlawfully,” a senior police officer said.Thousands of protesters had clashed with the police during a tractor parade called by the agitating farmer unions on January 26.After police permitted the rally, many protesters deviated from the agreed route and reached the Red Fort on tractors. They entered the monument and some of them even hoisted religious flags at the ramparts.The government has projected the three farm laws as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehensions that these laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and scrap the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre has maintained that the MSP and mandi systems will continue and will also be strengthened.

23-02-2021||Vijay Mohan||Scientists develop lead-free material to convert waste heat to electricity||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, February 23Indian scientists have found a new lead-free material which can efficiently convert waste heat to power small home appliances and automobiles.So far, most of the efficient thermoelectric materials developed by scientists use lead as a major constituent element, thereby restricting their use for mass-market applications.Scientists from Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bengaluru, have identified a lead-free material called ‘Cadmium doped Silver Antimony Telluride’ which can efficiently allow recovery of electricity from ‘waste heat’, marking a paradigm shift in the thermoelectric puzzle, the Ministry of Science and Technology announced on Tuesday.Thermoelectric energy conversion allows generation of electrical voltage when one end of a material is heated while keeping the other side cold. Finding an efficient material to realise this scientific principle has been a daunting task for scientists. It entails fitting in three seemingly different properties — high electrical conductivity of metals, high thermoelectric sensitivity of semiconductors and low thermal conductivity of glasses — into a single material.The team, led by Prof Kanishka Biswas, doped (meaning internally introduced) Silver Antimony Telluride with Cadmium and used an advanced electron microscopy technique to visualise the resultant ordering of atoms in nanometre scale. The nanometre-scale atomic ordering scatters phonons that carries heat in a solid material and enhances electrical transport by delocalizing the electronic state in the material.Previously reported state-of-the-art material is exhibiting thermoelectric figure of merit in the range 1.5-2 at the mid-temperature range of 400-700 degree Kelvin. The Indian team has reported a record increase in thermoelectric figure of merit of 2.6 at 573 degree Kelvin. This can provide heat for electrical energy conversion with an efficiency of 14 per cent.The findings have been published in international peer-reviewed journal “Science”. Efforts are on to commercialise the high-performance thermoelectric materials and devices; in collaboration with the industry where lots of waste heat is generated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scientists-develop-lead-free-material-to-convert-waste-heat-to-electricity-216514

23-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay High Court upholds bail to man accused of having links with ISIS||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday upheld a special court’s order granting bail to 27-year-old Areeb Majeed, accused of having links with the Islamic State (ISIS) terror network.A division bench of Justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale disposed of an appeal filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), challenging the special court’s order granting bail to alleged ISIS member Majeed.In March last year, Majeed was granted bail by a special NIA court, which noted the pace of the trial was slow, and also on the ground that the prosecution had not succeeded in proving its prima facie case against the accused.The HC said while it was upholding the lower court’s order granting bail to Majeed on the ground of pendency of trial, it was quashing the observations made by it (lower court) on merits of the case.The order said while Majeed’s case on slow trial appears to be on a “firm footing”, the special NIA courts observation with regard to no prima facie case established at this stage was “flawed”.The HC noted that the right to fair and speedy trial was a constitutional right and if after a long and lengthy trial the accused is found to be not guilty, then the number of years spent by him or her as undertrial can never be given back to them.It said in cases where a person was booked for serious and heinous offences, courts are required to perform a balancing act, so as to ensure that a “golden mean” is reached between the rights of the individual and those of the society at large.The HC bench in its order said Majeed had been charged under provisions of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and was accused of having returned to India with an intention to carry out terrorist activities here.“However, no death was caused by the alleged plans hatched by the respondent (Majeed), since he was arrested the moment he landed in India,” the court said.Majeed has been in custody for more than six years now, the high court said, adding the process of examining around 50 witnesses had taken more than five years and admittedly, there are 107 more witnesses to be examined.“Therefore, there is no likelihood of the trial being completed within a reasonable time in the near future,” the court said.The bench, while quashing and setting aside the lower court’s observations on no prima facie case being established, said it was strange the NIA court held that at this stage the prosecution had not succeeded to prove prima facie case on the basis of examination 49 witnesses.“The findings rendered in favour of the respondent (Majeed) in the impugned judgment (lower court order) appear to be flawed,” the HC said in its order.“We are of the opinion that considering evidence of 49 witnesses already examined, when 107 witnesses remained to be examined, was an irrelevant consideration taken into account by the NIA court,” the bench said.It noted that Majeed was an educated person and also comes from an educated family, hence his release on bail with stringent conditions imposed shall not be harmful to the society at large and it would not adversely affect the trial.The bench directed Majeed to furnish Rs 1 lakh as surety and also directed him to stay with his family at Kalyan in neighbouring Thane district.Majeed has to appear before the police in Kalyan twice every day for the first two months and once a day for the next two months.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh argued that there were over 100 witnesses yet to be examined in the trial against Majeed and hence, the NIA court ought not to have jumped to the conclusion that prima facie case was not established by the prosecution.The NIA’s case was that Majeed, along with three others, had travelled to Syria ostensibly for pilgrimage but never visited the pilgrimage sites and instead, joined the ISIS with an intention to indulge in jihadi activities.The probing agency had also claimed that Majeed returned to India with an intention of carrying out terrorist activities, including an attack on the headquarters of the Mumbai police.Majeed was arrested in November 2014 under provisions of the UAPA and the Indian Penal Code for allegedly waging a war against the nation and other charges.He was granted bail in March last year by a special NIA court.The NIA later approached the HC, challenging the lower court’s order.The HC had then in an interim order stayed operation of the bail granted, pending hearing of the NIA’s appeal.Hence, Majeed continued to remain in jail.While opposing the NIA’s appeal, Majeed argued that he had gone to Syria only to help people and denied all charges levelled against him.He had told the HC that it was his father who contacted the NIA and other government agencies to bring him back to India.He had also argued that the trial in the case was progressing slowly and there was no possibility of it being completed in the near future.

India drew the attention of the world to the issue of disaster management. You can see what happened recently in Uttarakhand. We should focus on improving disaster-resilient infrastructure that can withstand natural disasters," he said.The CDRI envisages partnership of national governments, UN agencies and programmes, multilateral development banks, financing mechanisms, private sector, and knowledge institutions to promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems to climate and disaster risks to ensure sustainable development.He hailed the role played by the IITs in developing technology to battle Covid, saying the hallowed institutes should now work fast on finding futuristic solutions to other health care problems."You represent the aspirations of 130 crore people of India," he said while addressing the convocation virtually.Noting that the needs and aspirations of the 21st century India had changed, Modi said IITs also needed to transform from being just Indian Institutes of Technology to Institutes of Indigenous Technologies."You have to become startups to bring about a change in the lives of people. You have to work on Self 3 - self-awareness, self-confidence and selflessness. You should recognise your potential and move forward, move ahead with full confidence, move ahead with selflessness," he told the students.

23-02-2021||New Delhi||Study suggests habitat loss is leading to inbreeding of Indian tigers||While Indian tigers have the highest genetic variation compared to other subspecies of the feline across the world, their populations continue to be fragmented by loss of habitat, leading to inbreeding and potential loss of this diversity says a new study that may inform conservation strategies.“As the human population started expanding, so also their signatures on the land. We know that some of these signatures would result in disrupting the ability of tigers to move,” Uma Ramakrishnan, co-author of the research, published in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution, told PTI.According to Ramakrishnan, molecular ecologist and assistant professor at the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, this habitat loss from human activities leads to tigers being “hemmed into their own protected area.”       “Now, they can only mate with the other tigers in their own population. Over time, this will result in inbreeding, they will end up mating with their relatives,” she explained.“Whether this inbreeding compromises their fitness, their ability to survive, we do not yet know,” the molecular ecologist added.While genetic diversity across a population improves their chances of survival in the future, the study said population fragmentation of tigers can decrease this variation, and endanger them further.Although tigers have received significant conservation attention, the scientists said very little is known about their evolutionary history and genomic variation, especially for Indian tigers.With 70 per cent of the world’s tigers living in India, the researchers said understanding the genetic diversity of tigers in the country is critical to feline’s conservation worldwide.The results of their three-year-long study offer insights into genomic variation in tigers and the processes that have sculpted it.Based on the results, the scientists believe there have been relatively recent divergences between subspecies, and intense population bottlenecks that may have contributed to inbred individuals.According to the NCBS scientist, maintaining structural connectivity, enabling tigers to move between protected areas can help overcome these bottlenecks.“This would require the right types of habitat between protected areas, for example having densely populated human settlements would not work. Further, there also needs to be functional connectivity, that tigers do actually move,” Ramakrishnan added.In the study, the scientists sequenced whole genomes from 65 individual tigers from four subspecies of the feline and conducted a variety of population genomic analyses that quantify genetic variability.They investigated the partitioning of genetic variation, possible impacts of inbreeding, and demographic history, and possible signatures of local adaptation.While the total genomic variation in Indian tigers was higher than in other subspecies, the study found that several individual tigers in the country had a low variation, suggesting possible inbreeding.According to the research, tigers from northeast India were the most different from other populations in India       “Given our results, it is important to understand why some Bengal tigers appear inbred and what the consequences of this are,” said Anubhab Khan, co-first author of the research.The study showed recent divergences between tiger subspecies, within the last 20,000 years, which the scientists believe is concordant with increasing human impacts across Asia and a transition from glacial to interglacial climate change in the continent.However, scientists believe this finding needs to be investigated further with expanded data and analyses of more tiger genomes.“Most studies focusing on species of conservation concern use limited numbers of specimens to try to gain understanding into how genomic variation is partitioned,” said Ellie Armstrong, co-first and co-corresponding author of the study from Stanford University in the US. “It is clear from our work here, and a growing number of other studies, that it is crucial to increase our sampling efforts and use caution when interpreting results from limited sample sizes,” Armstrong added.According to Ramakrishnan, the genomic variation of Indian tigers continues to be shaped by the ongoing loss of connectivity.“Population management and conservation action must incorporate information on genetic variation. I hope doing so will help India maintain the gains in tiger conservation achieved so far,” Ramakrishnan added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/study-suggests-habitat-loss-is-leading-to-inbreeding-of-indian-tigers-216499

Thus, it is clear that the operative muck disposal sites were not being maintained as per the Ministry of Environment and Forests laid down norms,” the bench said.“In view of the above, there is no merit in the appeal as ‘Polluter Pays’ principle has been rightly invoked for damage to the environment. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. The amount of compensation which may be recovered by the state pollution control board may be utilised for the restoration of the environment,” the tribunal said.The NGT noted that NTPC is operating Tapovan Vishnugad hydropower project and has set up 5 muck disposal dumping sites out of which three were completed 3-5 years back while two are still active and operational and the state PCB found deficiencies in respect of the same.The state PCB had passed an order under Section 33 A of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 (Water Act) requiring the appellant NTPC to pay compensation of Rs 57,96,000 on the polluter pays principle for the restoration of the environment. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ngt-directs-ntpc-to-pay-rs-58-lakh-for-damaging-environment-in-uttarakhand-216492
23-02-2021||New Delhi||How students and teachers can stay safe amid schools reopening ?||With the commencement of nationwide vaccination drive and the falling numbers of active Covid-19 cases, the government has decided to slowly allow schools to reopen. Starting in phases, the schools are first reopening for the students of the classes X and XII and later for the junior classes. Subsequently, it is essential that precautions for prevention of further spread are taken as seriously as before.The numbers might be dipping but the virus is still lingering and we have to take all possible measures to curb its spread. With children being one of the most vulnerable category, extra precautions need to be taken by the school authorities, teachers, parents of the students and the students themselves. Basic facts like social distancing, wearing masks, practicing hand hygiene need to be taught and demonstrated to them as the new norms of living.While calling students back to schools has been allowed by the government, in interest of the safety and health of children the schools must practise — Hybrid school model — this is a combination of distance/virtual learning and in-person/traditional form of schooling. This involves limiting the number of students that will come to school in one go so that social distancing can be practiced effectively.Hybrid school model(Inputs from MS Kanwar, Senior Consultant, Department of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi)School authorities should make sure that the building is clean and hygienic. Surfaces and objects (desks and tables) need to be wiped with disinfectant regularly. Promote regular and thorough handwashing and put sanitising hand-rub dispensers at prominent places around the workplace. Teach children the essence of practising respiratory hygiene and using a mask to cover the face and the nose. Restrict social events, assemblies and gathering at student canteens as well as practice of sharing food. Mandatory thermal screening, no person with slightest of symptoms of fever and cough should be allowed on the premises and recommended immediate self-isolation.

23-02-2021||---||WHO setting up its first global centre for traditional medicine in India: Modi||New Delhi, February 23A day after Indian Medical Association questioned the government for promoting ayurvedic tablet Coronil as a treatment for Covid, Prime Minister Narendra Modi backed the Indian traditional medicine sector saying it had gained prominence on the world stage and needed to focus harder on global demands of research and quality.The PM also cited how the WHO is in the process of establishing its first global centre for traditional medicine in India after “watching the strength of the sector”.Indian traditional medicines are herbal based and not harmful at all; rest assured on safety, the PM said amid a controversy after Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan attended the launch of Patanjali’s ‘Coronil’ which the producers touted as the first evidence-based medicine for Covid. Patanjali’s Ramdev even claimed WHO approval for the herbal drug but the WHO later tweeted to dissociate itself from any such move saying it had neither reviewed nor certified any traditional medicine for Covid.“Our Ayush network has performed incredibly well in Covid times, not just to boost immunity but also for scientific research. Ayush infrastructure has helped the country a lot. Along with Indian drugs and vaccines our spices and ‘kadas’ have contributed immensely and the world is experiencing their benefits. Our traditional medicine has made a place on the world stage,” the PM said on Tuesday as he interacted with stakeholders on health budget provisions which he described as unprecedented.The PM said people involved in production of traditional medicine and those engaged in ayurveda must focus globally.“Like the world is accepting yoga, it is also moving towards holistic health and wants a side-effect-free health system. Indian traditional medicine is herbal based and its attraction can rise rapidly. These medicines are not harmful. Rest assured. Watching the strength of our traditional medicine the WHO is setting up its global centre of traditional medicine in India. They have even announced it and the government is working on it. It is now our responsibility to take this reputation to the world,” said the PM.The PM said his government unlike the previous ones was looking at health as a holistic sector.“The health budget allocation is unprecedented and shows our commitment to ensuring accessible and affordable health treatment to all,” the PM said adding that the world was watching the Indian health sector.He said Indian medicines and devices had gained global trust and reputation during Covid times. He asked the industry whether India could become the hub of cost-effective production of medical devices the world wanted.“Our doctors, nurses and paramedics are set to be in huge demand and, therefore, the possibilities of foreigners wanting to study medicine in India are bound to increase. We should promote that,” the PM said, mentioning four schemes the government has launched to reduce India’s import dependence on raw materials for drugs and devices.“We have to aim self-reliance in raw materials for drug and medical device development. We have experienced the negative results of depending on foreign devices in the past,” he said, adding that the government seeks to take health accessibility to the last mile just as it ensures the last person in the country exercises his adult franchise.The PM said the new PM Atma Nirbhar Swastha Bharat Scheme seeks to strengthen Indian health sector to respond to future pandemics. He said the Covid experiences would be tweaked to eradicate TB by 2025.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-setting-up-its-first-global-centre-for-traditional-medicine-in-india-modi-216463

Condolences to the bereaved families. Praying that the injured recover quickly."     Expressing shock over the incident, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said he has ordered a thorough investigation into the case and directed the officials to take stringent action against the guilty."A high-level investigation into the incident is underway and stringent action will be taken against the guilty," he added.According to police, the incident took place at Hirenagavalli near Peresandra.Quarrying was stopped by the police on February 7 following complaints from the locals against rampant use of gelatin sticks.Yet, it continued clandestinely following which another raid was carried out a few days ago and the contractor was warned not to use gelatin anymore.The men working there went to dispose of the explosives in the wee hours of Tuesday when it went off accidentally.The driver of the vehicle who escaped with severe injuries in the legs and hand told police that the victims took him along carrying a bag with them."They were holding a bag and asked me to drive the vehicle to the forest. I remained seated in the vehicle but the door was open. They went to a secluded place and suddenly the blast occurred," said the driver.Karnataka Mines and Geology Murugesh Minister R Nirani said in a series of tweets that the government has been taking stringent measures against illegal mining activities, transportation and storage of explosives used for mining."It's rather very unfortunate that the blast occurred in Chikkaballapur before the wounds of the Shivamogga blast have healed," Nirani said.The government will leave no stone unturned in ensuring the safety of people in the mining areas, he said adding a thorough probe will be conducted to ascertain the cause of the explosion and the culprits responsible for this will be punished.Nirani further said the government will provide all necessary assistance to the kin of the deceased and injured persons.Praying for the speedy recovery of the injured, he said the senior officials were already on the spot and assessing the situation.Meanwhile, the Congress came down heavily on the state government, alleging the BJP leaders were behind the illegalities just as they were involved in Shivamogga."Instead of waking up from slumber after the Shivamogga blast and putting an end to illegal quarrying and use of explosives, the government stood in support of such activities leading to another explosion caused by gelatin.Just as Shivamogga, here too the BJP people are involved.Health Minister Dr K Sudhakar is directly responsible for this incident," the party tweeted.

23-02-2021||Washington||2 Indians plead guilty in multi-million-dollar robocall scam targeting Americans||Two Indian nationals have pleaded guilty to conspiracy and identity theft in connection with an overseas multi-million dollar robocall scam that defrauded thousands in the US, mostly elderly, the Department of Justice has said.Pradipsinh Parmar, 41, and Sumer Patel, 37, face a maximum sentence of 20 years each in prison for the conspiracy count. Parmar faces an additional mandatory minimum sentence of two years on the aggravated identity theft count, the justice department said in a press statement on Monday.Shehzadkhan Pathan, 39, leader of the conspiracy, operated a call centre in Gujarat's Ahmedabad from which automated robocalls were made to victims in the US. Pathan pleaded guilty in the case on January 15.After establishing contact with victims through these automated calls, Pathan and other “closers” at his call centre would coerce, cajole and trick victims to send bulk cash through physical shipments and electronic money transfers.According to court documents, Parmar collected money on behalf of the robocall conspiracy that victims had sent either by a parcel delivery carrier or through a wire service. Upon receiving the victims’ money, Parmar deposited these funds into bank accounts as directed by Pathan.Pathan and his conspirators used a variety of schemes to convince victims to send money, including impersonating law enforcement officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and representatives of other government agencies, such as the Social Security Administration, to threaten victims with severe legal and financial consequences.Conspirators also convinced victims to send money via wire transfer as initial instalments for falsely promised loans. A significant number of victims who were tricked or coerced into sending bulk cash were elderly, the statement said.Patel, on the other hand, retrieved over 250 individual wire transfers from 230 individual victims from October 2018 to March 2019 on behalf of Pathan, according to court documents.These wires totalled USD 219,520.98. Patel deposited the funds as instructed by Pathan. While living in Virginia Chesterfield County, Patel also received eight packages of cash sent by victims. Four of the eight packages are known to have contained a total of USD 56,200 in cash, it said.Parmar crisscrossed the US to collect nearly USD 6 million "that was stolen from more than 4,000 victims" in the international robocall scam, said Raj Parekh, Acting US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.As part of his guilty plea, Parmar admitted that over a two-year period from March 2017 to April 2019, he travelled to 30 states and collected at least 4,358 wire transfers sent by victims, with losses totalling at least USD 4,312,585.Additionally, Parmar received and attempted to receive at least 91 packages of bulk cash sent by victims from several states, totalling at least USD 1,593,591.Parmar also received at least 549 counterfeit identification documents sent to him by Pathan for his use in retrieving these packages and wires sent by victims, federal prosecutors alleged.Parmar and Patel are scheduled to be sentenced on June 18.

Upon enquiring, I came to know that he was arrested by police and shifted to Delhi,” the farmer leader's wife told reporters.She claimed that her husband was at the Delhi border and not at Red Fort when the violence broke out.         “He went alone to see the SSP because he was not afraid as he had done nothing wrong,” she said.

23-02-2021||New Delhi||IMA slams Vardhan over promoting Patanjali’s Coronil||The Indian Medical Association on Monday questioned Health Minister Harsh Vardhan about promoting Patanjali’s “unscientific” ayurvedic tablet Coronil as the first evidence-based medicine for Covid-19 and sought a public explanation from him.“Being the Health Minister of the country and a modern medicine doctor, how ethical is it to promote an unscientific product before the country? How justified it is to release a false, fabricated and unscientific product? If Coronil is so effective, why spend Rs 35,000 crore on vaccinations?” IMA asked Vardhan in a letter.The apex body of doctors accused the minister of violating the Medical Council of India’s Code of Ethics by promoting a drug with unsubstantiated claims of treatment. IMA chief JA Jayalal and Secretary General Jayesh Lele said they would write to the National Medical Commission about the “blatant disrespect” for the MCI code.“It was claimed by Baba Ramdev that Coronil had World Health Organisation’s certification. The WHO denied it. The false projection of an unscientific medicine by the Health Minister and its rejection by the WHO is an insult to the citizens,” the IMA said.The body said it was shocked to note the blatant lie of WHO certification for Ramdev’s medicine in the presence of Vardhan.The WHO yesterday said it did not review or certify any traditional medicine for Covid-19. This was after Ramdev had claimed to have the world health body’s approval for Coronil in the presence of ministers Vardhan and Nitin Gadkari. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ima-slams-vardhan-over-promoting-patanjalis-coronil-216255

Even as Speaker VP Sivakolundhu declared the confidence motion defeated today, the CM said the motion was not put to vote and the Speaker’s declaration was “invalid”.The Congress and the DMK slammed the BJP for “murdering democracy” saying they would seek legal opinion on whether nominated MLAs could vote on a trust vote. Narayanasamy and his Cabinet walked out of the Assembly before the confidence motion was taken up demanding that Speaker bar the three nominated BJP MLAs from voting.Earlier, the CM accused the BJP and former L-G Kiran Bedi of thwarting development plans for Puducherry and causing the current crisis.In the 33-member Assembly, the Congress had won 15 seats in 2016 and came to power with the support of three DMK and one Independent member. The seven vacancies (five Congress MLAs and one of DMK resigned while one Congress MLA was disqualified) brought the effective strength of the House to 26. The ruling combine was left with 12 MLAs while the Opposition had 14 (AIADMK 4; All India NR Congress 7 and BJP’s 3 nominated MLAs). The Opposition said it had no plans of staking claim to government formation yet. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cm-quits-as-congress-government-falls-in-puducherry-216272
23-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||BJP runs into resistance in western UP too||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 22After BJP leaders faced resistance in Punjab over the new farm laws, such scenes are being seen at the party’s western Uttar Pradesh bastion while its leaders are attempting to reach out to their support base, especially Jats, in rural areas. BKU’s Dharmendra Malik claimed that head of ‘Jawla khap’ Sachin Chaudhary refused to meet Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan, “who had been sent by Home Minister Amit Shah”. In a video posted by Malik, Chaudhary can be heard saying that “no one from the ruling BJP should try to meet him individually. They should meet the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha and its decision will be final (regarding the agitation against the three farm laws)”.Caste lines blurProf Sudhir Panwar, a Samajwadi Party leader from Bhainswal (Shamli), whose residents “resisted” the entry of Balyan, UP Cabinet minister Bhupendra Chaudhary and Shamli MLA Tejinder Nirwal yesterday said: “Farmers of western UP were upset due to the BJP’s attempts to divide the agitation on the basis of caste.”During Balyan’s visit today, Shoram village in Muzaffarnagar witnessed clashes between villagers and BJP supporters. “What we were fearing has started happening,” Panwar said.The headquarters of 32 village khaps, Bhainswal organised a mahapanchayat on February 5 against the farm laws. The event saw the participation of Jats, non-Jats, Dalits and Muslims. The support to farmers’ agitation from “non-Jats and Muslims” is threatening the saffron party’s carefully crafted caste equations in the state. After the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, the western UP region witnessed deep polarisation with Hindu Jats, non-Jats and Dalits gravitating towards the BJP.BKU leader Rakesh Tikait and the RLD’s Jayant Chaudhary are both Jats and most of the mahapanchayats have been in and around Jat-dominated districts. “The BJP’s Jat leaders have been asked to use their influence in dousing the agitation through “khaps’ informal social leadership”.The BJP strategy is two-pronged. First, to reduce and brand farmers’ agitation as Jat agitation so that other rural castes feel isolated, as seen during the reservation agitation in Haryana. Second, to divide Jats along party lines. However, the strategy is unlikely to succeed as agitation is not limited to Jats, observed Panwar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-runs-into-resistance-in-western-up-too-216273

He said immediately after coming to power, the BJP government would initiate systematic steps toward regeneration of the state’s industrial sector.The PM said the jute industry in Hoogly district, once a thriving sector, was now suffering under government neglect. Noting that Hoogly is famous for potato and paddy, Modi said growers would benefit immensely if food processing units came up in the area.

DAV School Gopalapuram please clarify,” Tharoor said after Carnatic vocalist TM Krishna questioned the move.Krishna also posted on Twitter a letter by some school alumni expressing disappointment at the question. The controversial question offers a background to R-Day violence before asking students to write a letter to the editor about it.The school alumni in a letter to the principal said, “We express our disappointment at such an inappropriate question being included in a Class X paper and call upon you to ponder the 10 principles of Arya Samaj etched in stone on the school campus. Unfortunately, the letter writing exercise turned out to be a highly editorialised polemic against one group of individuals, exhorting the students to take on a specific stance with no actual room for any individual thought.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chennai-school-question-paper-terms-r-day-vandals-maniacs-triggers-row-216327

23-02-2021||Chuchura (WB)||Modi attacks Mamata over ‘cut money’, insulting Bengali pride||Launching a frontal attack on the Mamata Banerjee government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleged on Monday it has perpetuated “syndicate raj” in all spheres of life in West Bengal where no work gets done without common people having to pay “cut money”.He accused the TMC government of pursuing “appeasement politics” to protect its vote bank while neglecting its cultural heritage and icons.“The state government’s cut money culture has vitiated the atmosphere to such an extent that you cannot even take a house on rent without paying it....you cannot rent a house without the syndicate’s permission,” he said.He attacked the Banerjee government for not allowing central schemes like the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi and Ayushman Bharat, depriving farmers and the poor of its benefits.“I have been told the house where Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay conceived and wrote ‘Vande Mataram’ is in an abysmal condition. The man who injected new life into the freedom struggle amid pervasive gloom of slavery...his house is a victim of neglect. It’s an insult to Bengali pride,” Modi said addressing a public rally here in Hooghly district.He also accused the TMC government of neglecting industrial development, including the state’s once thriving jute industry.“The people of West Bengal have made up their mind to usher in ‘asol poribartan’ (real change). The BJP will give Bengal a government that will ensure development of all but appeasement of none,” he asserted.Repeatedly attacking the state government, Modi said, “Development of Bengal is not possible as long as cut money culture, tolabaji persists.“Development of Bengal is not possible as long as the state administration patronises goondas, development of Bengal is not possible as long as the rule of law is not established.”Modi said once the BJP forms its government in Bengal, people will be able to preserve and protect their culture and nobody will be able to scare or suppress them.He said there was no dearth of potential investors but the threat of the syndicate and cut money dissuaded them from investing in the state. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-attacks-mamata-over-cut-money-insulting-bengali-pride-216089
23-02-2021||New Delhi||IMA 'shocked' over Patanjali's claim on Coronil, demands explanation from Health Minister Harsh Vardhan||The IMA on Monday expressed shock over the "blatant lie of WHO certification" for Patanjali's Coronil tablet, which the company claims is an evidence-based medicine to fight COVID-19, and demanded an explanation from Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in whose presence the medicine was launched.This comes in the wake of global health body, WHO, clarifying that it has not reviewed or certified the effectiveness of any traditional medicine for the treatment of COVID-19.Yoga guru Ramdev's Patanjali Ayurved had on February 19 said that the Coronil tablet had received certification from the Ayush Ministry as a medicine supporting COVID-19 treatment as per the World Health Organization's certification scheme.However, Patanjali's managing director Acharya Balkrishna later made a clarification about the certification through a tweet saying, "We want to clarify to avoid confusion that our WHO GMP compliant COPP certificate to Coronil is issued by DCGI, Government of India. It is clear that WHO do not approve or disapprove any drugs. WHO works for building a better, healthier future for people all over the world (sic).".@WHO has not reviewed or certified the effectiveness of any traditional medicine for the treatment #COVID19.  In a statement issued on Monday, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said, “Being Health Minister of the country, how justified is it to release such falsely fabricated unscientific product to people of the whole country...can you clarify the time frame, time line for the so-called clinical trial of this said anti-corona product?""The country needs an explanation from the minister. The Indian Medical Association will also write to National Medical Commission for seeking suo moto explanation for his blatant disrespect to the code of conduct of Medical Council of India,” the IMA said."Indian Medical Association is shocked to note the blatant lie of WHO certification...," it said.Haridwar-based Patanjali Ayurved had also released what it claimed was research work supporting Coronil's efficacy in COVID-19 treatment.The announcement regarding the Ayush certification for Coronil and release of a research paper calling it the "first evidence-based medicine for COVID-19 by Patanjali" was done at an event here attended by Vardhan.In a statement, Patanjali had said: "Coronil has received the Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CoPP) from the Ayush section of Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation as per the WHO certification scheme."     However, WHO South-East Asia in a tweet said: "@WHO has not reviewed or certified the effectiveness of any traditional medicine for the treatment #COVID19."Patanjali had introduced ayurveda-based Coronil on June 23 last year, when the pandemic was at its peak. It had to face severe criticism as it lacked scientific evidence regarding its efficacy.

23-02-2021||New Delhi||BJP leaders face resistance in western UP villages||While Punjab has been a witness to such scenes, in the BJP’s bastion of western Uttar Pradesh also saffron leaders are facing resistance in their attempts to “reach-out” to their support base, especially Jats in rural areas.The historic Sauram or Shoram village in Muzaffarnagar today witnessed clashes between villagers and leaders/supporters of BJP during a visit of Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan.According to Prof Sudhir Panwar several farmers suffered injuries during the clash.“What we were suspecting has started happening,” said Panwar, a Samajwadi Party leader from Bhainswal (Shamli).According to BKU’s Dharmendra Malik, the head of ‘Jawla khap’ Sachin Chaudhary “refused” to meet Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan “who was trying to get in touch with him at the behest of Home Minister Amit Shah”.In a video posted by Malik, Chaudhary can be heard saying that “no one from the ruling BJP should try to meet him individually. They should meet the Samyukta Kisan Morcha and their decision will be final (regarding the agitation against the three farm laws)”.Panwar, a Samajwadi Party leader from Bhainswal (Shamli) which “resisted/banned” the entry of Balyan, UP Cabinet minister Bhupendra Chaudhary and Shamli MLA Tejinder Nirwal yesterday, says farmers of western UP are upset due to “BJP’s attempts to divide the agitation on the basis of caste and Jats”.Bhainswal is headquarter of 32 villages khaps. The February 5 ‘mahapanchayat’ there in opposition of farm laws saw the participation of members of non-Jat, Dalits and Muslims along with Jats.“In a democracy every person has the right to expression, therefore ban on entry of leaders of a particular party is not the democratic way but people are angry,” says Panwar.  The support to farmers’ agitation from “non-Jats and Muslims” is threatening to upset the saffron party’s carefully crafted caste equations on the back of which it had been winning elections in the state.After the 2013 Muzzafarnagar riots, western UP region witnessed a deep polarisation with Hindu Jats, non-Jats, and Dalits gravitating towards the BJP.Speaking as an independent observer, Prof Panwar explains that BKU leader Rakesh Tikait and RLD’s Jayant Chaudhary are both Jats and most of ‘mahapanchayats’ have been in and around Jat-dominated districts.“BJP’s Jat leaders have been asked to use their influence in dousing the agitation through the “Khaps’ informal social leadership”.The BJP’s strategy is two pronged — reduce and brand farmers’ agitation as Jat agitation so that other rural castes associated with it because of economic reasons feel isolated as seen during the reservation agitation in Haryana. The second is to divide Jats along party line in the backdrop of RLD and Congress’ ‘mahapanchayats’.However, people in villages are angry and this strategy is unlikely to succeed as agitation is not limited to Jats,” says Panwar.The central leadership has asked Jat leaders from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan to reach out to the community at the ‘khap’ levels and ensure that “they do not feel alienated from the BJP”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-leaders-face-resistance-in-western-up-villages-216082

23-02-2021||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case accused Varavara Rao gets 6-month bail on medical grounds||The Bombay High Court on Monday granted interim bail for six months on medical grounds to ailing poet and activist Varavara Rao, an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case.The court said it could not be a “mute spectator” and permit 82-year-old Rao’s health condition to deteriorate in custody.A bench of Justices S S Shinde and Manish Pitale said there existed no doubt that given his current medical condition, Rao would face “acceleration and intensification of ailments” if he continued to remain in custody.It noted that medical facilities at the Taloja prison’s hospital in neighbouring Navi Mumbai were inadequate.Rao is currently admitted to Nanavati Hospital, a private medical facility in Mumbai.He has been in custody since August 28, 2018, awaiting trial in the case, which is being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).The bench granted bail to Rao for six months, while directing him to stay within the jurisdiction of the NIA court in the city during this period.Rao will be discharged from the hospital depending on his health condition and then released on bail, as per the HC.While granting Rao bail on medical grounds, the HC dismissed NIA’s argument that he was not entitled to relief on humanitarian grounds.However, the court imposed a host of stringent conditions on his bail, including prohibiting him from establishing contact with his co-accused in the case.It also dismissed the Maharashtra government’s submission that after discharge from the Nanavati Hospital, Rao would be shifted to the prison ward of the state-run J J Hospital in Mumbai.“We are of the opinion that this court, as a constitutional court, cannot be a mute spectator to the undertrial (Rao) being sent to prison and then togovernment hospitals where his health deteriorates further.“To be ultimately shifted to private superspeciality hospitals, upon intervention of courts...,” the HC said in its 92-page judgment.The bench said given the material on record, it had concluded that sending Rao back to the Taloja central prison where he was lodged as an undertrial, before he was shifted to the Nanavati Hospital, would “certainly endanger his life” and breach his fundamental right to health and life.The HC noted that in the past, Rao’s family had to approach court to get information on his health condition while in prison.It also observed that while Rao continued to suffer from multiple ailments in the prison and even contracted the COVID-19 infection, he was shifted to the Nanavati Hospital only after the HC’s intervention.“The undertrial’s (Rao’s) repeated admissions to government facilities which have proved to be inadequate (in the past), would lead to the undertrial or his relatives repeatedly approaching courts for appropriate directions for dealing with deterioration of his health if he is put back in custody,” the bench said.“In the said process, possibility of casualty cannot beruled out,” the court observed.It said Rao’s medical reports in the past pointed out that he suffered from several serious and age-related ailments. Some of the reports had also mentioned symptoms of dementia.Therefore, his family will be able to provide the best care for him, the court said.In its judgment, the HC also referred to the submission of Rao’s counsel, senior advocate Indira Jaising, on how long Rao was likely to live and what wouldcontinued incarceration mean for someone who was 82 years’ old.“How much life of the undertrial now remains also assumes some significance,” the high court said.“Admittedly, the undertrial is about 82 years old, suffering from health ailments noted above, requiring support from his immediate relatives in order to have some semblance of normalcy during whatever period of life now remains,” it said.The bench, however, also took note of the NIA’s apprehension that letting Rao go back home to Hyderabad on bail might result in his or his associates resuming “nefarious activities”.Thus, the HC directed him to stay in Mumbai while on bail, make fortnightly WhatsApp video calls to the nearest Mumbai police station, and prohibited large gatherings or large group of visitors from meeting Rao while he is out in bail.“Sending the undertrial back to where he belongs, is fraught with the risk of his presence being used by those allegedly associated with him to seek to revive the aforesaid nefarious activities,” the court said while imposing various conditions in his bail.The HC also prohibited Rao from indulging in activities similar to those that led to the FIR against him, and from making any national or international calls to his co-accused or to those engaged in “similar activities”.It also prohibited Rao from making any statements related to the case before print or electronic media.“With all humility at our command, keeping in view human consideration, the well recognised fundamental rights of theundertrial to have quality medical aid for serious ailments suffered by him, advanced age, inadequate facilities in the hospital attached to the Taloja Central Prison, we are of the opinion that this is a genuine and fit case to grant relief,” the court said.“Or else, we will be abdicating our constitutional duty and function as a protector of human rights and right to health covered under ghe right to life guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” it said.The court also directed Rao to either surrender before the NIA court or to apply to the HC for extension of bail once the six-month period is over.It also dismissed the NIA counsel Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh’s request for a stay on the bail order for three weeks.The HC said once the Nanavati Hospital had declared Rao fit to be discharged, and once the court had granted him bail, it could not send him back to the Taloja prison.The court also directed Rao to furnish a personal bond of Rs 50,000 and two sureties of the like amount.On February 1, the HC closed all arguments in the case and reserved its verdict on Rao’s medical bail plea and his wife Hemlatha’s writ petition that alleged a breach of his fundamental rights due to inadequate medical care and his continued incarceration.The case pertains to alleged inflammatory speeches made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which, the police claimed, triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial located on the outskirts of the western Maharashtra city.The police have also claimed that the conclave was organised by people with alleged Maoist links.

The Centre has told states that the Co-WIN application has been updated to enable self-registration by the elderly and the process would commence soon.Meanwhile, India has covered only around 60 per cent of the eligible health and frontline workers in the COVID inoculation drive with the centre repeatedly nudging states to buck up.Punjab, Chandigarh and Ladakh are among the states with less than 40 per cent coverage of the three crore priority group.As of Sunday 1,10,85,173 vaccine doses have been given.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccination-of-50-plus-people-from-march-centre-writes-to-states-216041
