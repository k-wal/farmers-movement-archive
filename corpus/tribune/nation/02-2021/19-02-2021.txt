The matter is a fallout of a one-side love affair. The accused gave some pesticide with water to the three girls,” Lucknow Range IG Laxmi Singh told reporters here.Both accused are residents of Pathakpur village in the Ashoha area and were held on a tip-off, the IG said.During interrogation, Vinay told police that he was involved in agriculture and owned a piece of land at Baburaha village, near the spot where girls were found on Wednesday night.According to police, Vinay told them that the girls used to go to the fields for fodder and they became friends during the coronavirus lockdown.He had a one-sided love affair with one of the girls.“We used to play and eat together in the field. I had a one-sided love affair with her. When I proposed her, she rejected. When I asked her this month to give me her phone number, she did not give due to which I was angry and decided to kill her,” Vinay told police.“On Wednesday, I mixed pesticide in a water bottle and asked my friend to bring snacks. The three had it and when they asked for water, I gave them the water bottle in which pesticide was mixed and they drank it. I had left their bodies in the field,” the IG said quoting Vinay’s confession.Apart from Section 302 (murder) of the IPC, police have slapped Section 201 against the accused for causing disappearance of evidence.Earlier in the day, the last rites of the two teenage girls were performed amid tight security arrangements, officials said.Komal (15) and Kajal (14) were buried in their agriculture fields in the presence of senior officials and police personnel.The district officials had made elaborate arrangements with heavy deployment of security personnel and barricades installed.The security personnel covered about one kilometre on the four paths reaching the village with a magistrate-level official posted at every barricade to check people.Personnel from six police stations were deployed.The bodies were brought to their village after a post-mortem was done on Thursday but the last rites could not be performed on the day, police said.Unnao District Magistrate Ravindra Kumar said talks were held on Thursday with the dead girls’ family, who were not willing to take it up immediately as they were waiting for their son to arrive from another city and had cited that the funeral cannot be done as it was already sunset.The DM refuted reports of any pressure being exerted on the family and said the last rites were performed as per their wishes.When asked if the family has made any demand, the DM said officials, including the ADM, were present on the spot but they did not give any “demand letter”.The DM claimed despite the presence of some outsiders, there was peace in the village.The district unit president of BJP, Raj Kishore Rawat, and local MLA Anil Singh were present during the funeral.On Friday, BSP legislators walked out from the Uttar Pradesh Assembly over the incident, alleging that police did not take prompt action in the case.The party moved an adjournment notice with BSP Legislature Party leader Lalji Verma alleging that police did not take any action on the day of the incident and accused the government of adopting a lax attitude. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-held-in-unnao-deaths-case-girls-cremated-amid-tight-security-214756
19-02-2021||New Delhi||Love Jihad: SC refuses to entertain PIL against MP law on religious conversions||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a PIL challenging a Madhya Pradesh ordinance regulating conversions due to inter-faith marriages.“Approach the Madhya Pradesh High Court. We would like to have the views of the high court. We have sent similar matters back to the high court,” a Bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told petitioner Vishal Thakre – an advocate.Thakre alleged that the ordinance infringed a person’s right to privacy and freedom of choice and violated his/her fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (right to equality), 19(1)(a) (right to free speech) and 21 (right to life and personal liberty) of the Constitution.The top court — which had on January 6 issued notice to Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand government on PILs against similar laws on religious conversions — had earlier refused to entertain certain other petitions on the issue as well.However, it had refused to stay provisions of an Uttar Pradesh Ordinance and an Uttarakhand law aimed at checking unlawful religious conversion for inter-faith marriages.On Wednesday, it had allowed Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind – an organisation espousing Islamic causes in India—to become a party to petitions challenging laws passed by some BJP-ruled states to check unlawful religious conversion for inter-faith marriages.Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind alleged that a large number of Muslims are being harassed under these laws across India.It had also allowed governments of Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to be made parties to the petitions challenging the controversial laws after it was pointed out that the two states have laws similar to those in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand which are already under challenge.The Uttar Pradesh Vidhi Virudh Dharma Samparivartan Pratishedh Adhyadhesh, 2020 (Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020) – which was promulgated in November last– prescribes imprisonment from one year to 5 years, or Rs 15,000 fine (in normal cases) minimum three years and maximum 10 years, and fine of Rs 25,000, if the girl is a minor or from the SC/ST community. It prescribes a jail term of minimum three years up to 10 years, and Rs 50,000 fine in cases involving mass religious conversion. The offence is cognizable and non-bailable.According to the Ordinance, no person shall convert or attempt to convert either directly or otherwise any other person from one religion to another by use of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage nor shall any person abet, convince or conspire such conversion.The petitioners contended that the laws violated right to life and personal liberty and right to religion guaranteed under Articles 21 and 25 of the constitution respectively, as they authorised the state to suppress personal liberty and the freedom to practice religion of one’s choice.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/love-jihad-sc-refuses-to-entertain-pil-against-mp-law-on-religious-conversions-214753
19-02-2021||New Delhi||Samyukta Kisan Morcha demands ‘fair investigation’ into Unnao case||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmer unions, on Friday demanded a “high-level fair investigation” into the death of two minor girls in Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao.The farmers’ body said proper medical treatment should be given to the third victim, who is battling for life, and called for “strict punishment to the culprits”.“Samyukta Kisan Morcha expresses deep condolences to the victim’s family after the mysterious death of two of the three Dalit sisters in Unnao of UP. The governance and administration system of Uttar Pradesh is once again under suspicion where there is no safe space for women. We demand proper medical treatment of injured women, a high-level fair investigation into this incident and strict punishment to the culprits,” it said in a statement.Three girls, aged 16, 15 and 14, were found in an agricultural field in Babuhara village under the Asoha police station area of Unnao on Wednesday night.Villagers had rushed the teenagers, who are related, to a hospital, where two of them were declared brought dead. The third girl, who is on ventilator support at a Kanpur hospital, is being treated for suspected poisoning, the police said on Thursday, adding they have registered a murder case in connection with the deaths.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha also announced it would celebrate “Pagdi Sambhal Day” on February 23 in the memory of Sardar Ajit Singh, the uncle of Shaheed Bhagat Singh and founder of the “Pagdi Sambhal” movement.             The song “Pagdi Sambhal”, written by Banke Dayal, editor of weekly Jhang Sial, had become the anthem for the peasant movement against three agricultural laws by the British government in 1906.    “The reflections of the movement that Chacha Ajit Singh had started at that time can be observed in this farmers’ movement as well. It is an appeal to all farmers to participate in this program by placing poster-banner of Chacha Ajit Singh on tractors and other vehicles and by wearing green turban,” the statement read. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/samyukta-kisan-morcha-demands-fair-investigation-into-unnao-case-214747

The earlier engagements include Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla’s visit in November 2020, a virtual meeting between the two Foreign Ministers in August 2020 during which several key projects and initiatives were announced and a telephone conversation between PM Modi and President Solih in April 2020.Solih, ever since he assumed office in November 2018, has taken concerted initiatives to move his country away from the close alignment with China by his predecessor.India has reciprocated in full measure by rapid and comprehensive assistance during the pandemic, including making Maldives the first destination to receive Covid vaccines.This was preceded by 5.5 tons of essential medicines, airlifting of 6.2 tons of medicines by the IAF from various India cities through Operation Sanjeevani, supply of 580 tons of food aid by naval ships and the deployment of Rapid Response Medical Team to assist in pandemic prevention.India also undertook a series of economic and financial initiatives at the peak of the pandemic to revive Maldivian economy and provide budgetary cushion to its dwindling revenues primarily driven by tourism. These were announced by Jaishankar during his video conference meeting with his Maldivian counterpart in August 2020.These included the extension of soft loan of $ 250 million as budgetary support, supporting the implementation of Greater Male Connectivity Project -- the largest civilian infrastructure project in Maldives, connecting Male with three neighbouring islands by construction of a bridge-and-causeway link spanning 6.7 km, through a financial package consisting of a grant of $ 100 million and a new Line of Credit of $ 400 million.The DPR for this project has been prepared and the tendering process is on. The creation of an Air Travel Bubble has boosted tourist inflow in Maldives and India became the largest tourist sending country in 2020. This trend has continued in 2021 with 30,000 Indians visiting Maldives till mid February out of 1,38,000 foreign tourists.Both countries are part of India's security grid including Coastal Surveillance Radar (CSR) station of Indian Navy's National Command Control Communication Intelligence network.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/external-affairs-minister-jaishankars-visit-to-firm-up-ties-with-maldives-214741
19-02-2021||New Delhi||SC directs RBI to lay down regulations in 6 months for locker facility management in banks||Holding that banks cannot wash off their hands towards their customers for the operation of lockers, the Supreme Court Friday directed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to lay down regulations within six months mandating the steps to be taken by banks with respect to locker facility management.A Bench comprising Justices M M Shantanagoudar and Vineet Saran said with the advent of globalisation, banking institutions have acquired a very significant role in the life of the common man as both domestic and international economic transactions within the country have increased multiple folds.The top court said people are hesitant to keep their liquid assets at home as “we are steadily moving towards a cashless economy.”“Thus, as is evident from the rising demand for such services, lockers have become an essential service provided by every banking institution. Such services may be availed of by citizens as well as by foreign nationals,” the bench said.Moreover, due to rapid gains in technology, “we are now transitioning from dual key­operated lockers to electronically operated lockers,” the top court said.In the electronically operated lockers, though the customer may have partial access to the locker through passwords or ATM pin, etc., they are unlikely to possess the technological know­how to control the operation of such lockers, the Bench said.“On the other hand, there is the possibility that miscreants may manipulate the technologies used in these systems to gain access to the lockers without the customers’ knowledge or consent,” it said.The apex court said that a customer is completely at the mercy of the bank, which is the more resourceful party, for the protection of their assets.“In such a situation, the banks cannot wash off their hands and claim that they bear no liability towards their customers for the operation of the locker,” it said.The Bench said that very purpose for which the customer avails of the locker hiring facility is so that they may rest assured that their assets are being properly taken care of.“Such actions of the banks would not only violate the relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, but also damage investor confidence and harm our reputation as an emerging economy.“Thus it is necessary that the RBI lays down comprehensive directions mandating the steps to be taken by banks with respect to locker facility/safe deposit facility management,” the court said adding that banks should not have the liberty to impose unilateral and unfair terms on the consumers.“In view of the same, we direct the RBI to issue suitable rules or regulations as aforesaid within six months from the date of this judgment,” it said.The bench also held that it is also left open to the RBI to issue suitable rules with respect to the responsibility owed by banks for any loss or damage to the contents of the lockers, so that the controversy on this issue is clarified as well.The judgment came on an appeal filed by Kolkata native Amitabha Dasgupta against a order of National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.Dasgupta filed a complaint before the District Consumer Forum seeking a direction to United Bank of India to return the seven ornaments that were in the locker; or alternatively pay Rs. 3 lakh towards the cost of jewelry, and compensation for damages. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission accepted the State Commission’s finding that the Consumer Forum has limited jurisdiction to adjudicate on the recovery of the contents of the locker.

19-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||No further ‘exemption’, Centre tells Punjab, Haryana to ensure online payment to farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 19The Centre has asked Punjab and Haryana to ensure online payment to farmers from the coming procurement season and stated that “no further relaxation on this account will be accorded”.Both the state governments have been seeking time for implementation of direct online payment initiative.“The government is regularly pursuing with state governments of Punjab and Haryana for ensuring direct online payment into farmers’ accounts since 2015-16.“However, both the state governments have been routinely approaching the Centre for granting exemption/seeking time for implementation of direct online payment initiative,” said the Ministry of Food and Public Distribution and Consumer Affairs.“The Centre has therefore, directed the State Governments of Punjab and Haryana to ensure online payment to farmers through e-mode from upcoming season and that no further relaxation on this account will be accorded,” said the Ministry.With the decision coming amid the ongoing farmer agitation against the three farm laws, officials said the e-mode predates the legislations and that “the government has no intention to eliminate arthiyas in Punjab and Haryana and no directions have been issued to eliminate arthiyas from the mandi system”.The e-mode of payment will ensure that all value chain participants, including farmers, arhityas, mandis, etc, get their payments directly instead of getting paid through another value chain participant like arhitya paying the farmer. This ensures transparency and benefits all. This is not a replacement of the current APMC system, it said.According to officials, “In Punjab, MSP was paid to the farmers through arthiyas, and in Haryana, FCI made the payment directly to farmer’s bank account through online mode, whereas state agencies made payment of MSP to the farmers partly through arthiya and partly directly to farmer’s account through online mode as per the option given by the farmers in e-Kharid portal.”“Digital mode of financial benefit transfers or payments by government agencies to beneficiaries has been highly successful and appreciated tool of transparency which has been instrumental in eliminating leakages in delivery of benefits. E-mode of payment has already been adopted partially by Haryana and Punjab. For example, a part of payment for this paddy procurement was done through e-mode,” it saidThe Centre has released a record Rs 1,25,217.62 crore so far this year and Rs 2,97,196.52 crore more will be released during this financial year towards food subsidy of which Rs 1,16,653.96 crore has been reflected in the PFMS towards Punjab. In respect of Haryana, the sum amounts to approximately Rs 24,841.56.This apart, procurement through bio-authentication of farmers has also been introduced in Uttar Pradesh, the Ministry said, adding that Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh are also keen to adopt bio-authenticated procurement which will ensure transparency and help in tracking the end-use beneficiary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-further-exemption-centre-tells-punjab-haryana-to-ensure-online-payment-to-farmers-214728
19-02-2021||Kolkata||IED might have been used in attack on Bengal minister: Official||An improvised explosive device (IED) might have been used in the attack on West Bengal minister Jakir Hossain, a senior official of the Criminal Investigation Department said on Friday.Hossain, the minister of state for labour, was injured in the bomb blast on Wednesday night at Nimtita railway station in Murshidabad district.CID sleuths along with special task force personnel and forensic team members visited the explosion site this morning and collected samples from there, he said.“According to our findings from the blast site at the Nimtita station, it seems that an advanced IED was used.Samples have been collected from the spot,” the official of the investigating agency told PTI.The sleuths have recovered parts of an iron bar and a battery used in two-wheelers and an electrical circuit from a spot, around 100-metre away from the explosion site, he said.“We have also got CCTV footage that will help us in our investigation,” the officer said.According to him, a video clip that captured the moment of the blast and showed an associate of the minister trying to remove something was also sent for forensic examinations.“We are examining CCTV footage of the platform and have spoken to some people who were there when the explosion occurred.“They claimed bombs that were kept in a bag exploded when someone was trying to remove it. We have recovered some materials which could be parts of a bag. Forensic tests are being conducted,” the officer said.Meanwhile, the state government has decided to provide ‘Z’ category security to the minister, another official said.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had on Thursday alleged that the bomb attack on Hossain was part of a conspiracy as certain people were “pressuring” him to switch over to another party.Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had also called for an NIA probe into the blast.Hossain, the Trinamool Congress MLA of Jangipur, suffered multiple injuries and was brought to SSKM Hospital here on Thursday.He underwent surgeries at the state-run hospital and was stable, an official of the medical facility said.The health condition of 13 others, who were also injured in the bomb blast and admitted to the hospital, was also “stable”, he added.

19-02-2021||Jaipur||56 kg gold given to weigh then PM Shastri in 1965 to go to govt||Gold weighing 56.86 kg, given to the District Collector in Rajasthan’s Chittogarh for weighing then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri in wake of the 1965 India-Pakistan war, will be passed on to the government, a court has ordered.The gold, valued at Rs 4.76 lakh at that time, is now valued at Rs 27.29 crore.The District and Sessions Court in Chittorgarh on Wednesday directed the officials concerned to hand over the gold to the Assistant Commissioner of Central Goods and Service Tax.The controversy over ownership of the gold dates back to late 1965 when the precious metal was given to Chittorgarh District Collector for weighing Shastri. The case has been heard five times earlier in different courts since then, and each time, the decision went in the government’s favour.At present, this gold is lying in a cupboard in the Udaipur District Collector’s office.On December 9, 1965, a person named Gunwant filed a case against Ganpat and two others, alleging that the accused did not return 56.86 kg gold to him.On December 16, 1965, Ganpat handed over the gold to Chittorgarh Collector for weighing Prime Minister Shastri, who had a scheduled visit in Udaipur. However, Shastri passed in Tashkent in January 1966 following talks with Pakistan organised by the then Soviet Union. Thereafter, police seized the gold but its custody was given to the Chittorgarh Collector.In 1969, a challan was presented in the Assistant District Session Court in Udaipur and gold was then brought to Udaipur.On January 11, 1975, the court sentenced Ganpat and Hiralal to two years imprisonment and rights over the gold were given to the Gold Controller.Ganpat and Hiralal challenged the judgment in the sessions’ court and were freed, but they did not regain the right to possession of the gold.A petition was again filed by Gunwant against the verdict in the High Court, which, on September 14, 2007, upheld the order of acquittal, but rejected the appeal for transferring them rights over the gold.In 2012, Ganpat’s heir Govardhan filed a writ in court, saying that the gold belonged to his father and police had recovered it from him. However, this writ is still pending.On July 17, 2020, the Assistant Commissioner, CGST, Chittorgarh submitted an application in the Chief Judicial Magistrate’s court for delivery of the gold, and on  August 5, 2020, the court said that the High Court has issued directions for the delivery of gold to the CGST official.Govardhan then appealed to the session court, which also decided in favour of the gold be transferred to the official. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/56-kg-gold-given-to-weigh-then-pm-shastri-in-1965-to-go-to-govt-214717

We will straightway expunge. Observations made against members of the tribunal stands expunged from the record,” a Bench headed by Justice Rohinton F Nariman said at the very outset.NCLAT members Justice (retd) JK Jain, Bavinder Singh and Vijay Pratap Singh had on September 25 last year referred a case relating to entry of book of accounts and acknowledgement of debt by a company to a five-member bench headed by NCLAT acting chairperson Justice Bansi Lal Bhat.Later, the five-member Bench had remarked that the referral judgment adopted “cut-paste methodology” and embarked on a “painful misadventure” to refer the matter to the five-member Bench.Taking exception to these remarks made in the five-member Bench, the three NCLAT members—Justice (retd) JK Jain, Bavinder Singh and Vijay Pratap Singh, had moved the top court.“We are with you,” the top court told the petitioners while expunging the impugned remarks.The petitioners contended that they had only acknowledged the position in law that the larger Bench was competent enough to consider the earlier verdict on the issue.It was a well-settled law that the larger Bench must not venture into making personal comments against members of the referral Bench only because it finds the reference order was not maintainable or not in accordance with the law, they had submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-expunges-remarks-by-nclat-five-judge-bench-against-three-of-its-sitting-members-214715

19-02-2021||Santiniketan (WB)||Modi invokes Tagore’s world view, asks Visva-Bharati students to help farmers, artisans access global market||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday praised the world view of poet-philosopher Rabindranath Tagore and asked Visva-Bharati students to help farmers and artisans of nearby villages find global markets.He said Guru Rabindranath Tagore had not envisioned the university as a typical educational institution but one that will help Indian culture realise its full potential globally.Addressing online the convocation of Visva-Bharati university that was launched by Nobel laureate Tagore in 1921 and designated the first central university in 1951, Modi said knowledge was not a “still and static but a dynamic concept”.He asked the institution’s students to prepare a 25- point vision document for the next 25 years that will lead all education establishments in the country to emulate it and enhance India’s image globally.“A starting point could be that the students under mentorship of teachers of this inspirational institution begin helping farmers, artisans living in villages nearby to find global markets for their products. That will be a step towards building an ‘Aatmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) Bharat,” he said.He said West Bengal can become an example of how unity can boost national growth and progress.“Bengal is an inspiration for Ek Bharat-Shreshth Bharat campaign. Visva-Bharati will play a big role in the 21st-century knowledge economy, taking Indian knowledge and identity to every corner of the world. Students should prepare a vision document for the next 25 years about the 25 biggest goals of Visva-Bharati in 2047,” he said.He told the gathering that with knowledge comes responsibility and the knowledge attained by the students was not theirs alone but a legacy for future generations.“Your knowledge is not only yours but society’s... it is the heritage of the country. Your knowledge and skill can make a nation proud or push society into the darkness of slander and ruin,” he said.Modi said some highly educated and skilled people were spreading terror and violence in the world, while others were toiling day and night to free people from a global epidemic like COVID-19.“It is not about ideology but the mindset, whether it is positive or negative,” he said.Modi said it was for the students to decide whether they wanted to be part of the problem or solution, and asked them not to be afraid of taking risks.“If your intentions are clear and your loyalty is to ‘Ma Bharati’ (Mother India) every decision of yours will take you towards finding a solution. It’s for you to decide whether you want to be a part of the problem or solution.“You may not get the results you thought you will after you had taken a decision, but you should not be afraid of making a decision,” he said.The prime minister said the new National Education Policy (NEP) was a major step towards building a self-reliant India as it gave impetus to research and innovation.He said the NEP broke the old restrictions and allowed students to realise their potential, promoted entrepreneurship and self-employment, research and innovation.“This new national education policy is a major milestone in the making of an Aatmnirbhar Bharat,” he said.In his speech peppered with references to Tagore, a native of Bengal but idolised by all Indians, Modi said, “Gurudev believed that we have to discover ourselves among the varied ideologies and differences.” —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-invokes-tagores-world-view-asks-visva-bharati-students-to-help-farmers-artisans-access-global-market-214707

19-02-2021||New Delhi||Conveyed to Indian govt our commitment to protect privacy of personal conversations: WhatsApp||Hours after announcing the decision to go ahead with its controversial privacy policy update, WhatsApp on Friday said it has conveyed to the Indian government that it remains committed to protection of privacy of personal conversations across the country.Last month, the messaging app had faced a volley of questions from the Indian government after it informed users that it was updating its privacy policy under which it could share limited user data with Facebook and its group firms.The backlash and users opting for rival apps Telegram and Signal, prompted WhatsApp to delay the rollout to May but on Friday, the company said the policy will be rolled out, but the platform will allow users to read it at “their own pace”.WhatsApp will also provide a banner offering additional information on the update.“Due to misinformation and based on feedback from our users, we have pushed back the timeline of acceptance of WhatsApp’s terms of service and privacy policy to the 15th of May. In the meantime, we continue to engage with the government and are grateful for the opportunity to answer questions that we received from them,” WhatsApp said in an e-mailed statement to PTI.It added that the company has conveyed that it continues to protect the privacy of personal conversations across India and ensure that the platform remains safe and secure for everyone to engage on.In a blogpost on Friday, WhatsApp said it will display a banner in the app in the coming weeks “providing more information that people can read at their own pace”.“We’ve also included more information to try and address concerns we’re hearing. Eventually, we’ll start reminding people to review and accept these updates to keep using WhatsApp,” the Facebook-owned company said.WhatsApp also said the new in-app notification looks different from the one users saw in January and that has been redesigned based on feedback from users.“...but the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy remain the same. As a reminder, this update does not change the privacy of people’s personal conversations and does not expand our ability to share data with Facebook,” WhatsApp said.Amid concerns raised by users on the issue, the Indian government had in January asked WhatsApp to withdraw the changes, saying unilateral changes are unfair and unacceptable.The government had contended that not giving users an option to opt out raised “grave concerns regarding the implications for the choice and autonomy of Indian citizens”. It had also questioned why Indian users are being subjected to differential treatment when compared to their European counterparts where the changes do not apply.WhatsApp has clarified that people who haven’t accepted the privacy policy after May 15 can still receive calls and get notifications, but they’ll need to agree to the update to send messages.It added that in accordance with its policies, user accounts will remain active to allow people to accept the new terms of service and updates.Issues ranging from provocative and inflammatory content to misinformation to data breaches have placed social media companies including Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter on the line of fire over the past many months.The Indian government has confronted these companies on multiple occasions and asserted that they need to comply with the rules of the land and crackdown on misuse of their platforms.Intermediary guidelines, which applies to digital platforms like Facebook and Twitter, are in the final stages and are expected to be announced soon. The proposed rules aim to curb misuse of social media by possibly tightening the timelines for taking action on malicious content, and raise the accountability of digital platforms to users and Indian law.WhatsApp has about 2 billion users globally, with India – as its largest market – having over 400 million users.In its blogpost on Friday, WhatsApp said it will do much more to make its “voice clear going forward” and added that it had previously used the ‘Status’ feature to share information around the update.“As a reminder, we’re building new ways to chat or shop with a business on WhatsApp that are entirely optional. Personal messages will always be end-to-end encrypted, so WhatsApp can’t read or listen to them,” it noted.WhatsApp also highlighted that services to users on the platform remain free and it charges businesses to provide customer service on its platform.It said some shopping features involve Facebook, so that businesses can manage their inventory across apps and that it will display more information directly in WhatsApp so people can choose if they want to engage with businesses or not.Concerned about the privacy of their data, many users are flocking to rival messaging platforms such as Signal and Telegram — pushing downloads of these apps into millions.WhatsApp sought to play down the trend. “During this time, we understand some people may check out other apps to see what they have to offer. We’ve seen some of our competitors try to get away with claiming they can’t see people’s messages — if an app doesn’t offer end-to-end encryption by default that means they can read your messages,” it said.Without naming any rival, WhatsApp said “people are looking for apps to be both reliable and safe, even if that requires WhatsApp having some limited data”.“We strive to be thoughtful on the decisions we make, and we’ll continue to develop new ways of meeting these responsibilities with less information, not more,” it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/conveyed-to-indian-govt-our-commitment-to-protect-privacy-of-personal-conversations-whatsapp-214702

19-02-2021||New Delhi||Ready for Kerala chief ministership if BJP wins: 'Metroman' Sreedharan||Set to enter the political fray by joining the BJP next week, technocrat E Sreedharan on Friday said his main aim is to help the party come to power in Kerala and that he will be open to chief ministership.He also said that the focus will be on developing infrastructure in a big way and bring the state out of the debt trap if the BJP wins the assembly polls that are likely to be held in April-May this year.Known as ‘Metroman’ as well as for the efficiency in completing big infrastructure projects, Sreedharan told PTI that he will contest the assembly elections if the party wants and will also be open to chief ministership if the party asks.The 88-year-old technocrat also made it clear that he will not be interested in governorship, saying that it is purely a “constitutional position and no powers at all” and that he won’t be able to make any positive contribution to the state in such a position.“My main idea is to bring BJP to power in Kerala. If BJP comes to power in Kerala, there will be three to four major areas we want to focus. One is infrastructure development in a big way and another is to bring industry to the state,” he said.Speaking over phone from Ponnani in Kerala where he is based now, Sreedharan said that a finance commission could also be formed for the purpose of improving the finances of the state, which is in a “debt trap today”.“The state is in a debt trap today, so much of borrowings. And debt burden on each Malayalee is Rs 1.2 lakh today.... That means we are heading for bankruptcy and the government still continues to borrow. The state finances need to be propped up and for that, we need to find a solution,” he said.His entry into the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is being seen as a major boost for the party in election-bound Kerala. The state is being ruled by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) alternately for the past many years.“If BJP wants, I will contest (the assembly elections),” he said during an interview over phone.Sreedharan said that he is “certainly” ready to be the chief minister if the party wants him to be after coming to power.When asked about whether he will be open to chief ministership, he said, “If they (BJP) want, certainly. To tell you very frankly, unless I am the chief minister these (priorities) cannot be achieved.”     He is likely to formally join the BJP on February 25 and said that he was entering the “political fray”.On the reasons for deciding to join the BJP which is in power at the Centre, Sreedharan said that he wanted to do things for the benefit of Kerala as the UDF and the LDF have not been able to bring any tangible progress to the state.“Why I chose BJP is for a different reason. The two others in Kerala—UDF and LDF—have been ruling Kerala alternately.... They have not been able to bring any tangible progress to the state, not even one industry has come to the state in the last 20 years...“They were having tussles with the (central) government all the time. The two governments are not able to see eye to eye on many matters. The development of the state is suffering. If the BJP comes to power here, they will have a good rapport with the Government of India,” he said.He was referring to apparent differences between the Centre and the ruling LDF in Kerala.On what it means to enter the political fray, Sreedharan said it only means that all his professional responsibilities are coming to an end by the end of this month.“All the responsibilities taken up by me are coming to an end. I thought I will give time for the benefit of Kerala state. That is possibly only if we enter politics. Do something for the state,” he noted.Currently, he is working on a project to rebuild a bridge in Kerala and the professional commitment will come to an end this month. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ready-for-kerala-chief-ministership-if-bjp-wins-metroman-sreedharan-214688

His legacy of courage, patriotism, sacrifice and selfless service to the nation will continue to inspire generations to come,” he told a gathering at the National Library.Recalling how Bose, as a brilliant student cracked the ICS, Shah said, the legendary freedom fighter left the job and plunged into the freedom struggle just to drive home the message that the nation was more important to him than a comfortable life under the British yoke.Shah said Bose’s popularity was evident when he twice became president of the Congress, once after defeating the candidate of Mahatma Gandhi.“Netaji is still loved and respected by people like he was many, many years ago. His indomitable spirit still inspires people,” he said.It was Netaji’s undaunted spirit and enthusiasm that led to the formation of the Indian National Army (INA), the journey for which began from the soil of Bengal, Shah said.“Sacrifice is the only means to take a nation forward even if that means sacrificing one’s career. Had Netaji thought of his career, the INA would not have been formed,” he added.The Home Minister asked the youth of the country to read about the life of Bose and his struggles. “Only a young generation that knows history can build a strong nation,” he said.He also inaugurated the ‘Biplabi Bangla’ exhibition on the life of freedom fighters from Bengal like Khudiram Bose and Rash Behari Bose, and flagged off a cycle rally.Divided into three teams named after Netaji, Khudiram Bose and Rash Behari Bose, the cyclists will collectively traverse 900 km to spread the message of the illustrious freedom fighters.

19-02-2021||New Delhi||SC refuses to entertain plea against MP law on religious conversions||The Supreme Court Friday refused to entertain a plea challenging the validity of controversial Madhya Pradesh ordinance regulating conversions due to inter-faith marriages.A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde asked petitioner lawyer Vishal Thakre to go to the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the proceedings conducted through video conferencing."Approach the Madhya Pradesh High Court. We would like to have the views of the high court. We have sent similar matters back to the high court," said the bench which also comprised Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.The plea said the Madhya Pradesh law, which followed a similar ordinance made by the Uttar Pradesh in the name of 'Love Jihad', infringed a person's right to privacy and freedom of choice leading to the violations of fundamental rights under Articles 14, 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution.The top court had also refused to hear some other pleas on the issue in past.      However, the court, on January 6, had issued notice to Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand government on the pleas of NGO 'Citizens for Justice and Peace' and others against their laws on religious conversions.Then on February 17, the top permitted the NGO to also implead Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh as parties to its petition challenging the controversial laws.It has also allowed Muslim body Jamiat Ulama-I-Hind to become a party to the petition on the ground that a large number of Muslims are being harassed under these laws across the country.Laws under challenging included the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020 and the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018 which regulate religious conversions of interfaith marriages.

19-02-2021||Betul (Madhya Pradesh)||Former Madhya Pradesh minister 'calls Kangana Ranaut naachney gaane wali'||Former Madhya Pradesh minister Sukhdev Panse has allegedly called actor Kangana Ranaut a ‘naachney gaane waali’.Panse said Ranaut, who had insulted the farmers protesting at the Delhi borders, had to face a Congress-led protest during the shooting of her film 'Dhaakad', leading to police action on the party workers.When some Congress leaders opposed her, the state police allegedly assaulted the Congress workers.Kangana was at Sarni in Betul district where the Congress protest took place last week. Police used force on the Congress leaders and also registered cases against them.On Thursday, Congress workers took out a rally under Panse and submitted a memorandum to the district collector.Panse said the police action was against democracy.The Congress has been supporting the farmers' agitation against the farm laws.“The police should not act as a puppet of Kangana's as governments keep changing. There should be a fair investigation into the police action against the Congress workers and no action should be taken against our party workers till the probe is completed,” Panse added.More than 250 Congress workers on February 12 protested at Sarni, where Ranaut was shooting. They had demanded that she apologise for her tweets against farmers.In response, Kangana had tweeted: “Police protection has been increased around me as Congress workers in MP held a protest to stop my shoot. Congress MLAs are saying they are protesting on behalf of farmers. Which farmer gave them such power of attorney? Why can’t they protest for themselves?” IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-madhya-pradesh-minister-calls-kangana-ranaut-naachney-gaane-wali-214682

19-02-2021||United Nations||State-sponsored terrorism leads to increase in discrimination against minorities: India||State-sponsored terrorism targeted against specific communities leads to increase in discrimination against minorities and their further marginalisation, India has said, calling on UN member states and agencies to not give an opportunity to justify terrorism on any ground.“The scourge of terrorism has emerged as a major source of discrimination in our societies today. State-sponsored terrorism targeted against specific communities lead to increase in discrimination against minorities and their further marginalisation in society,” India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti said.He said this while addressing the ECOSOC Meeting on ‘Eliminating Racism, Xenophobia and Discrimination for All in the Decade of Action for the SDGs’ on Thursday.India calls on countries to desist from such terrorist acts and also calls on member states and the UN bodies to not give an opportunity to justify terrorism on any ground, he said.As the world becomes interconnected, new media, especially social media had emerged as a platform for amplifying racial hatred and discriminatory ideas, Tirumurti said.“We need to tackle infodemic with all our might to ensure social cohesion. United Nations has the responsibility to ensure that countering racism and discrimination should not be limited to a select few but should encompass all those affected,” the UN ambassador added.Addressing the session, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres gave a clarion call to reject racism.“Racism plagues our world. It is abhorrent. It is ugly. And it is everywhere. We must condemn it without reservation, without hesitation, without qualification,” he said.The UN chief said as societies become ever more multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-cultural, there was a need for greater political, cultural and economic investments in inclusivity and cohesion, to harness the benefits of diversity rather than perceiving it as a threat.Tirumurti noted that India was firmly committed to social, economic and political equality through legislations and well-designed multi-sectoral interventions.He told the meeting that in the wake of COVID pandemic, India had adopted a variety of interventions, particularly targeted at vulnerable sections, to ensure that there was no discrimination in the society.“The role of the State in the last one year has been crucial in ensuring that we are able to recover with minimal damage and at the same time contribute to the welfare of all countries,” he concluded.

Editorial teams should ensure that such broadcasts have verified content. Channel editors to ensure proper editorial control so that investigation is not hampered,” Justice Singh said while posting the matter for further hearing in March.The high court also asked the 22-year-old climate activist—who was sent to three-day judicial custody by a Delhi court on expiry of her five-day police remand—to ensure that people connected to her didn’t indulge in unnecessary or scandalising messages and the parties didn’t go on a maligning course during the investigation.On behalf of Ravi, senior advocate Akhil Sibal wanted the court to order certain TV channels to take down reports having reference to the “so-called WhatsApp conversations” from their online platforms and restrain them from disseminating any information of the probe which was not part of public record.However, the court refused to order removal of any such content at this stage with regard to the probe into the FIR against Ravi for her alleged involvement in sharing a toolkit backing farmers” protest.“There is no doubt that regulation of content has been a very contested issue across the world and India is no exception to it,” the high court noted.The high court asked media houses to ensure that no leaked investigation material was broadcast as it could affect the probe.

At the same time, there are also those young and educated persons who are fighting coronavirus. This is not just about ideology but mindset. What you do depends upon what is your mindset, whether positive or negative. It also depends upon whether you want to become a part of solution,” the Prime Minister said addressing the convocation at Visva Bharati University.“If you become a part of the nation first, you will see solutions in the worst situations. If your intentions are pure, dedicated towards ‘Maa Bharti’, your step will be towards the direction,” he said.“We should never forget the feelings that unite the country,” he added.The Prime Minister is also the Chancellor of the University.“There was a reason why Gurudev named it Vishva Bharati. It is not just a place to study but attempt to reach the highest echelons of Indian culture,” the Prime Minister said.As many as 2,535 students received their degrees during the ceremony.Visva Bharati was founded by Rabindranath Tagore in 1921. It is the oldest central university in the country.In May 1951, Visva Bharati was declared to be a Central University and “an institution of national importance” by an Act of Parliament. The University followed the pedagogy devised by Tagore, though gradually it evolved in the format in which modern universities developed elsewhere.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rise-above-self-interest-pm-tells-youth-asking-them-to-put-nation-first-214665

19-02-2021||Etawah (Uttar Pradesh)||13 turtles found dead in Sarsai Nawar lake in Uttar Pradesh||Around 13 turtles, belonging to an endangered species, have been found dead in the Sarsai Nawar lake of Etawah district, which was declared a Ramsar site last year.The dead turtles were identified as Indian flap shell turtles.A forest department team that visited the spot, has sent the dead turtles to a veterinary hospital for autopsy.District forest officer, Etawah, Rajesh Verma, said, “Recently, nearly 1,324 turtles seized in Kanpur were released in the Sarsai Nawar lake of the district. It appears that the majority of the turtles that died, could be from the same lot.“But this aspect is a matter of investigation. Also, we have to wait for the autopsy report to get the actual cause of death of turtles. Sample of water from the lake have also been collected and sent to the laboratory for forensic examination.“As per the rescue team, the death toll is likely to increase as counting of dead turtles is still on and further investigation is underway in this regard,” he added.The death of turtles was first reported on Tuesday and the number kept increasing thereafter.Experts are of the view that such a large number of turtles has not been found dead in the lake in recent years.“A detailed protocol on rehabilitation and release of seized turtles is required. It is quite possible that most of these turtles have died of shock due to their poor handling by the poachers. In the absence of a standard protocol, high mortality among seized turtles is quite possible,” said an official of the Society for Conservation of Nature.“They need proper medication first and should be kept at rehabilitation centres, which should be equipped with adequate infrastructure to follow approved standard operating procedures for quarantine, captive management and healthcare of aquatic animals,” he added.The Union government gave the Ramsar site tag to Sarsai Nawar wetland in Etawah in 2020.The aim of the Ramsar list is to develop and maintain an international network of wetlands which are important for the conservation of global biological diversity and for sustaining human life through the maintenance of their ecosystem components, processes and benefits. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/13-turtles-found-dead-in-sarsai-nawar-lake-in-uttar-pradesh-214660

After so many years, it was during the last four years under the present government that total literacy campaign was given due importance,” a KSLMA official told PTI.As per the state Planning Board figures 2011, there were 18 lakh illiterate people in Kerala, he said.KSLMA director PS Sreekala said the achievement in the literacy and education sector was the result of special drives implemented by the agency focusing on the marginalised areas including tribal colonies and fishing hamlets.Listing out various projects by the Literacy Mission, she said as many as 12,968 people became literate through the special tribal literacy drive implemented in Wayanad and Attappady in Palakkad district, one of the largest and most backward tribal settlements in the southern state.A total of 11,941 people achieved literacy through the “Aksharasagaram” project, a literacy-cum-equivalency project implemented in coastal areas of the state, she said.“Changathi” drive helped over 5,400 migrant workers to learn Malayalam while 3188 people turned literate through the “Navachethana”, an initiative envisaged to eradicate illiteracy in scheduled caste (SC) colonies, the official added.

The death toll increased to 1,56,111 with 97 daily new fatalities, the data updated by the Health ministry at 8 am showed.The number of people who have recuperated from the disease surged to 1,06,67,741, which translates to a national Covid recovery rate of 97.3 per cent and the case fatality rate stands at 1.42 per cent.The total active cases remained below 1.5 lakh.There are 1,39,542 active cases of coronavirus infection in the country, which comprises 1.27 per cent of the total caseload, the data stated.The 97 new fatalities include 38 from Maharashtra, 14 from Kerala and 10 from Punjab.A total of 1,56,111 deaths have been reported so far in the country, including 51,669 from Maharashtra, followed by 12,444 from Tamil Nadu, 12,282 from Karnataka, 10,896 from Delhi, 10,239 from West Bengal, 8,709 from Uttar Pradesh and 7,166 from Andhra Pradesh.Dr Samiran Panda, head, Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases division, ICMR, said it is always a cause of concern if the number of cases go up."If the number of reported cases goes up, it is always a cause of concern for any state. These cases will not only happen in young adults but also in elderly population with co-morbidities, which is a reason for worry. The reason (for rise) is the same that when a susceptible population comes close to the infected people the infection transmits from the infected person to the susceptible person," he told PTI.He urged people to maintain preventive measures."This is the time we should have our preventive measures maintained. We have a vaccine but it is one of the prevention measures. So maintaining physical distancing, limiting social interaction should be followed. If people go out for marriage ceremonies, parties, it leads to transmission," Panda said.Noted virologist Shahid Jameel said the easy explanation for rise in cases is increased activity and complacency."A majority of people have stopped wearing masks thinking it's over. This at a time of increased economic activity and person-to-person contacts. There could also be unique local factors like local trains in Mumbai, cold weather and indoor activity in J-K, etc. But a more worrisome thought is if variants might be responsible? Our genomic sequencing density is not high enough to pick this early," he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nation-sees-13-193-new-covid-cases-97-more-deaths-214646
19-02-2021||Washington||Indian IT professionals to benefit as  immigration bill introduced in US Congress||In a major move that will benefit thousands of Indian IT professionals in America, the Biden administration has introduced an ambitious immigration bill in Congress which among other things proposes to eliminate the per-country cap for employment-based green cards.The US Citizenship Act of 2021 proposes a pathway to citizenship to 11 million undocumented workers, elimination of per country quota for employment-based green cards and work authorisation for dependents of H-1B foreign workers.The bicameral immigration bill, if passed by both the chambers of the Congress – House of Representatives and the Senate – and signed into law by President Joe Biden, would bring citizenship to millions of foreign nationals, including undocumented workers and those who came to the country legally.The legislation would also benefit thousands of Indian IT professionals and their families.Those waiting for a Green Card for more than 10 years would get the legal permanent residency immediately as they would be exempted from the visa cap.Indian IT professionals, waiting for more than a decade now, and whose number runs into thousands, are likely to be the biggest beneficiary of this provision of the bill.Authors of the bill – Senator Bob Menendez and Congresswoman Linda Sanchez – told reporters that the US Citizenship Act of 2021 establishes a moral and economic imperative and a vision of immigration reform that is expansive and inclusive.It grows the economy by making changes to the employment-based immigration system, eliminating per-country caps, making it easier for STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) advanced degree holders from US universities to stay in the US and improving access to green cards for workers in lower-wage industries.It would also give dependents of H-1B holders work authorisation, and prevent children of H-1B holders from "ageing out" of the system.

Kerala state party president K Surendran said Sreedharan (88), who is credited with changing the face of public transport system in the country, will officially join during the “Vijaya Yatra”, which the saffron party is launching with the aim to expand footprint in the southern state.

Sreedharan also expressed willingness to contest the polls “if the BJP asked him to”. “It is for them to decide the constituency. A lot of development works can be done and I hope to do it by joining the BJP,” he added. He also criticised other political parties for showing India in a bad light and “failing to do any good to Kerala”. Speculations are rife that Sreedharan, who is currently overseeing the rebuilding of the Palarivattom flyover, could be the BJP’s Chief Ministerial candidate in the Assembly elections.

But we all met this challenge with a coordinated response. — Narendra Modi, Prime Minister.Addressing a workshop on “Covid-19 management, experience and the way forward” with 10 neighbouring countries, including Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked experts to consider a special visa scheme for doctors and nurses so that they could travel quickly within the region during health emergencies on the request of the receiving country. The Pakistan representative at the meeting is learnt to have supported India’s stand on collaboration and stated “hyper-nationalist mentality won’t help”. Pakistan said it would be part of any regional cooperation on the issue.The PM earlier posed several searching questions to the delegates asking them if the civil aviation ministries of the 10 countries could coordinate a regional air ambulance agreement for medical contingencies and a regional platform for collating, compiling and studying data about the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines. “Can we similarly create a regional network for promoting technology-assisted epidemiology for preventing future pandemics?” the PM asked the delegates of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Mauritius, Nepal, Pakistan, Seychelles, Sri Lanka and India.Modi hailed the Asian region’s collaborative response to the pandemic, recalling the March 2020 meeting of SAARC leaders where a Covid-19 Emergency Response Fund was established with India’s initial contribution of $10 million.“If the 21st century is to be the Asian century, it cannot be without greater integration among the countries of South Asia and the Indian Ocean island countries. The spirit of regional solidarity you have shown during the pandemic has proven that such integration is possible… Many experts had voiced special concerns about the densely populated Asian region and the pandemic’s impact on its population. But we all met this challenge with a coordinated response,” he said.The Prime Minister said collaboration was a valuable take-away from the pandemic. “Through our openness and determination, we have managed to achieve one of the lowest fatality rates in the world. This deserves to be applauded. Today, the hopes of our region and the world are focused on rapid deployment of vaccines. In this too, we must maintain the same cooperative and collaborative spirit,” he said.Barring Pakistan that has procured Covid vaccine from China, other attending countries have received Indian support. The PM also suggested today that countries of the region share successful public health policies and flagged Ayushman Bharat and Jan Arogya schemes as success stories from India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prime-minister-for-saarc-medical-visa-214346

While France is active in the region, Germany and the UK intend to deploy naval assets in the region.“It was important for the international community that the direction of changes remains positive and beneficial to all,” noted an Indian read-out of the virtual meeting that was attended by Foreign Ministers S Jaishankar, Marise Payne (Australia), Toshimitsu Motegi (Japan) and Antony Blinken (US).The discussions on regional issues included a reiteration of their common vision for a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region, with clear support for ASEAN cohesion and centrality. “It was noted that the Indo-Pacific concept had gathered growing international support, including in Europe,” added the read-out.The ministers exchanged views on combating the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, maritime security, HADR, supply chain resilience and counter-terrorism.In discussion pertaining to Myanmar, India reiterated the need to uphold the rule of law and democratic transition. “Noting that regular Quad consultations hold value, the ministers agreed to continue these useful discussions,” said the MEA.Meanwhile, Jaishankar will visit Maldives and Mauritius next week. In Maldives, he will review bilateral ties and progress of ongoing bilateral projects, besides holding discussions on the pandemic situation.In Mauritius, he will call on the President Pritivirajsing Roopun and PM Pravind Jagnauth.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/committed-to-ensuring-free-indo-pacific-region-quad-fms-214335
19-02-2021||Satya Prakash||SC issues notice to Centre, EC on PIL seeking e-voting, postal ballots for voters away from constituency||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 18The Supreme Court on Thursday issued notices to the Centre and the Election Commission on a PIL seeking exercise of franchise through a system of postal ballots or e-voting for people stationed outside their constituency.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde asked the Ministry of Law and Justice, and the EC to respond to the PIL filed by K Sathyan, after his counsel Kaleeswaram Raj submitted that the electoral laws needed to catch up with modern technology.“What kind of plea is this? Sitting in England, you will vote here... If you can’t care enough to go to your constituency, why should the law help you,” the Bench commented even as it agreed to examine the issue.The petitioner has demanded introduction of e-voting by means of a secured remote electronic voting system which would allow citizens to cast their vote virtually. He has sought voting rights for students, NRIs and other people stationed outside their constituency at the time of elections.An OTP-based system should be evolved for fault-free identification of voters and CCTVs should be installed in all polling booths across India, he submitted.“Several sections of voters — including internal migrant labourers, employees, students and business professionals stationed outside the constituency, as well as NRIs and overseas migrant labourers on account of their profession, occupation, education, trade, business, marriage etc have been alienated from the electoral process for very long,” the petition read.Sathyan urged the top court to issue necessary directions to ensure a fair election process by providing double databases for transactions at the central local levels to reduce the chances of data and EVM manipulation.Maintaining that logistic concerns could not curtail voting rights, he submitted that insistence on physical presence violated the right to equality. Exclusion of a significant part of the population stationed outside their constituencies amounted to deprivation of the right to practice democratic process, he contended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-ec-on-pil-seeking-e-voting-postal-ballots-for-voters-away-from-constituency-214301
