But, our electoral laws do not permit overseas political parties to work here,” Punchihewa told reporters.Punchihewa’s comments came after media reports quoted Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb as saying that the BJP was planning to extend its footprint in Sri Lanka and Nepal.On Saturday, Deb said Amit Shah, when serving as BJP president, had told party leaders that the BJP would establish rule in other regional countries as part of ‘Atmanirbhar South Asia’ initiative. Deb said the BJP deeply valued the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) partnership.Interestingly, last year, President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa’s brother, Basil, had said he envisioned modelling the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna either on the lines of the BJP or the Communist Party of China.

As the great drama unfolds many anarchists rallying behind Disha Ravi, the 21-year-old, sole bread winner, daughter of single mother, climate change activists will run for cover. WhatsApp groups, editing option and conversations will unravel many a characters,” he said in a series of tweets. “Not one anarchist ready to answer the question...How 21-year-old student got access to edit Toolkit,” he also questioned.Party spokespersons Sambit Patra and Gaurav Bhatia maintained that a criminal is a criminal and gender and his or her age is immaterial if the person is not a juvenile. “Besides, she should have known the antecedents of a man like Mo Dhaliwal,” BJP leaders added.“Kasab was 21 when he attacked Mumbai,” said Bhatia, adding that “supporting farmers is not a crime but conspiring against India and inciting others is”.Sambit Patra also said today's press conference by the police on Disha Ravi’s arrest "has totally exposed the nefarious conspiracies of the break India forces to demean the integrity of India"."These people not only created a toolkit which perpetrated the January 26 disruption, but also collided with a banned organisation 'Poetic Justice Foundation' to promulgate the Khalistani design to belittle India."As far as the Opposition particularly the Congress is concerned, in an attempt to attack PM Narendra Modi they have always stood with anti-India forces."Astonishingly for the Opposition Bharat Ratnas like Lata Mangeshkar and Sachin Tendulkar can be investigated but 'break India forces' should receive protection under the garb of 'freedom of expression'," he said."These parties were crying arrest the perpetrators on January 26, but today when they are arrested the same Congress cries foul," Patra said.Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat also said age has nothing to do with the crime. “If age is the criteria then Param Veer Chakra Second Lt Arun Khetarpal, martyred at 21 is who I am proud of. Not some toolkit propagandists,” he said. “While India was making PPE kit for the world, these people were making toolkit against Indians,” he added.Meanwhile, BJP's IT cell in-charge Amit Malviya accused the Left for “using young impressionable minds as cannon fodder for their deranged politics for a long time”. From “JNU to Jamia, AMU to Nadwa and now Disha Ravi, are all part of their sinister plot,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disha-ravis-arrest-bjp-defends-police-action-212837

15-02-2021||New Delhi||Govt to set up digital intelligence unit to tackle pesky calls, financial frauds||The telecom ministry will set up an intelligence unit and a consumer protection system as part of continuing efforts to tackle the menace of pesky calls as well as to take strict action against financial frauds perpetrated using telecom resources.The move follows a direction from telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who chaired a high-level meeting to look at ways to address rising concerns of consumers over unsolicited messages on mobile phones, repeated harassment through SMSes promising loan transactions through fraudulent ways. It is also aimed at making digital transactions more safe and secure.“In the meeting, the Minister of Communication directed officials to take strict action against erring telemarketers and individuals involved in harassment of telecom subscribers. Further, the minister observed that telecom resources are also being used to carry out financial frauds and dupe the common man of his hard-earned money.“Clear directions were issued to the officials to take strict and tangible action to stop such activities immediately,” a statement said on Monday.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) already has regulations in place to check pesky calls. However, several unregistered telemarketers still make calls to people which often also leads to fraudulent incidents.On February 3, the Delhi High Court directed Trai to ensure “complete and strict” implementation of the regulation issued by it in 2018 for curbing Unsolicited Commercial Communications (UCC).“The officials apprised the minister that for UCC and financial fraud-related complaints, time is of utmost essence and a quick time-bound action will help in reducing such menaces.“Accordingly, a nodal agency named as Digital Intelligence Unit (DIU) will be set up. The main function of the DIU will be to coordinate with various LEAs (Law Enforcement Agencies), financial institutions and telecom service providers in investigating any fraudulent activity involving telecom resources,” the statement said.At the licence service area level, Telecom Analytics for Fraud Management and Consumer Protection (TAFCOP) system will also be created.“The above system will strengthen the trust of people in the digital ecosystem and will make financial digital transactions primarily through mobile more secure and reliable, which will result in promotion of Digital India,” the statement said.Prasad has directed the officials of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to conduct a meeting with telecom operators and telemarketers to apprise them of the seriousness of the issue and to ensure compliance with laid down rules and procedures in this regard.In case of any violation, imposing financial penalty on telemarketers and disconnecting resources in case of repetitive violations have also been proposed, as per the statement.“The minister also directed to devise special strategies, including blocking of telecom operations due to rising concern in Jamtara (Jharkhand) and Mewat (Haryana) regions for curbing fraudulent activities involving usage of telecom resources,” the statement said.

15-02-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC dismisses plea of Chandigarh dentist for criminal prosecution of NCB chief||The Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed the plea by a dentist seeking directions to the Centre, Central Vigilance Commission and CBI to investigate and launch criminal prosecution on his complaint against Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) chief Rakesh Asthana.Justice Suresh Kait also imposed a cost of Rs 20,000 on the petitioner - Dr Mohit Dhawan.Advocate Sushil Tekriwal, who appeared for the dentist, said the amount has to be deposited in the high court within two weeks.He said the detailed order containing all the reasons was not yet available, but one of the grounds of dismissal was that the plea was without any merits.On February 12 the matter was listed before Justice Yogesh Khanna who had recused himself from hearing the matter and directed that it be listed before another bench.The Chandigarh-based dentist had first moved the Supreme Court for criminal prosecution of Asthana based on his allegations that the NCB was indulging in extortion in connivance with other police officers.However, he had on February 8 withdrawn the plea from the apex court and said he would approach the Punjab and Haryana High Court to pursue the remedy.Dhawan, in his petition, has contended that he had filed a complaint against Asthana, who also heads the BSF, before the CBI Director in 2019 but there has been no action or adjudication so far.The plea in the top court had alleged that Central Vigilance Commission and the CBI were sitting over the complaint for more than 16 months and not updating the petitioner on the status of the action taken and hence criminal prosecution be initiated against all such erring persons.

15-02-2021||New Delhi||Your protest has brought new ray of hope: Maulana Sajjad Nomani to farmers||The ongoing farmers’ protest against the three farm laws has brought a new ray of hope against injustice in the country, Maulana Sajjad Nomani said on Monday.The spokesperson of All India Muslim Personal Law Board was speaking at the Singhu border, one of the major sites of the farmers’ agitation.“So many organisations have been, for years, trying to create awareness about the injustices in the country, and this movement has brought a new ray of hope from Kashmir to Kanyakumari.“Thanks to you and your leadership, who realised that ‘enough is enough’ and decided to raise your voices, we have been reassured that the era of darkness in the country is ending and that justice is not very far away,” Nomani said.Ever since the farmers’ agitation started in November last year, the Islamic scholar has regularly been extending his support to the movement through his YouTube channel.On Monday, he said the Muslims of the country were standing behind the farmers in their fight.“On behalf of the Muslim society, I assure you that we are all standing behind you and support you, and request you to not lose hope and continue this fight.“It is because of your strength that God has chosen you to lead this movement,” he said.Criticising the government’s decision to introduce the laws during the difficult period of the pandemic, Nomani said the farmers’ movement was not just a protest against the three laws, but also a “freedom struggle”.“The three laws ensure that the produce generated out of the blood and sweat of lakhs of Indian farmers gets locked up in the hands of private businessmen.“The protest is not just a fight against the three laws, but a fight for freedom. The country that became independent after so much struggle, is being made a slave again, but India is not meant to be a slave,” he said.“The government has constantly been saying that the MSP (Minimum Support Price) was, is and will be there, but why isn’t it making it a written law?” he added.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points—Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur—for nearly 80 days, demanding a repeal of the three agri laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP).In the absence of the MSP, the farmers fear they will be left at the mercy of private corporations.Nomani also warned the protesting farmers against attempts to divide their movement.“There is a conspiracy to divide this movement, but we should all remain united, because India is a country of love and brotherhood,” Nomani said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/your-protest-has-brought-new-ray-of-hope-maulana-sajjad-nomani-to-farmers-212804
15-02-2021||Mumbai||Sedition case: None of my tweets incited violence, Kangana to HC||Actor Kangana Ranaut told the Bombay High Court, through her lawyer, on Monday that none of her tweets had ever incited violence or caused any criminal acts, and sought quashing of the FIR registered against her for sedition by Mumbai Police.The high court will continue hearing the arguments on February 26 and the interim protection from arrest granted to Ranaut and her sister Rangoli will continue till then.Ranaut’s counsel Rizwan Siddique told a bench of Justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale that the actor had not committed any wrong through her tweets.He said the magistrate’s court in suburban Bandra had erred in allowing registration of a First Information Report (FIR) against Ranaut on charges including sedition.Siddique urged the High Court to quash the lower court’s order as well as the FIR.“There is absolute non-application of mind in the (Bandra) court’s order. Even the sections invoked against me do not constitute any offence. None of my tweets has invoked any reactions from the public. They will not attract punishment as they were not followed by violence. What happened after the tweet? Was there any criminal act after my tweets?” Siddique told the high court on the behalf of Ranaut.The actor and her sister Rangoli had challenged the order of the magistrate’s court to initiate criminal proceedings against them and the subsequent summons issued by the Mumbai Police.The FIR was registered against Ranaut and Rangoli in October last year on the directions of the magistrate’s court after Munawwar Ali Sayyad, a casting director and fitness trainer, filed a complaint citing some tweets and statements made allegedly by Ranaut and her sister.In an affidavit filed in the HC earlier this month, Sayyad had said that among other things, Ranaut and Rangoli promoted “hatred and contempt, and incited disaffection towards the Maharashtra government,” through their tweets.He said in the affidavit that the magistrate’s court was therefore, justified in directing the police to initiate proceedings and invoke the offence of sedition under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code against them.In his complaint to the magistrate court, Sayyed had alleged that Ranaut, through her tweets and television interviews, had continuously defamed Hindi film industry by portraying Bollywood as a hub of nepotism, favouritism, drug addicts, communally-biased people and murderers, etc.He said Ranaut and Rangoli had also repeatedly promoted enmity between communities through their remarks.However, Ranaut’s counsel Siddique on Monday denied these allegations.He told the high court that the Bandra court had failed to follow due procedure and didn’t apply its mind in permitting the police to initiate action against Ranaut and her sister.Earlier last month, Sayyad had also filed an application seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against Ranaut for allegedly breaching a previous undertaking she had given to the high court.He said in his plea that on November 24, Ranaut had given an undertaking that she will not make statements pertaining to the Mumbai Police’s investigation into the sedition case filed against her.However, on January 8, just before she went to the police station, Ranaut tweeted a video in which she spoke to her fans about the investigation, Sayyad had said.The HC is hearing Ranaut’s plea against the Bandra court and Sayyad’s contempt application together. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sedition-case-none-of-my-tweets-incited-violence-kangana-to-hc-212803

The three-member committee is holding consultations with stakeholders both online and in person.In a statement, the committee said it held a detailed discussion with academicians and professionals on Monday through video conferencing.“In total, 7 eminent academicians and professionals in the field participated through video conferencing for detailed deliberations with the committee members,” it said.The committee members requested the participants to give their views on the three farm laws. “All the participating professionals and academicians gave their detailed views and suggestions...,” the statement said.The Supreme Court had on January 12 stayed the implementation of the three contentious farm laws for two months and asked the committee to submit a report within two months after consulting the concerned stakeholders.Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders for over two months now seeking repeal of the new legislations, introduced by the Centre last year, saying they are pro-corporate and could weaken the mandi system.The 11 rounds of the talks between the Centre and 41 protesting farmer unions has so far remained deadlocked even though the former has offered concessions including suspension of the legislations for 18 months, which the unions have rejected.

He then dumped their bodies in a sewer,” Desai said.While the minor girl’s body was recovered on Sunday, that of her mother was found on Monday from the sewer line near Gandhidham city, he said.“We took help from the municipality to fish out the bodies from the sewer line,” the police officer said.Primary investigation revealed Singh is a native of Bikaner and came in contact with the woman, who used to reside near his house in the Rajasthan town, more than 10 years ago, he said.Following marital discord, the woman left her husband’s home and started living with the accused, Desai said.The woman left her husband’s house along with two daughters and came to Gandhidham in 2009 to live with Singh, he said.“The couple was living together without marriage,” said Desai.In her complaint, the woman’s elder daughter (20) has said that recently her mother learnt about Singh’s affair with another woman.As per the FIR, Singh used to fight with his live-in partner almost daily over petty issues, said Desai.On February 12, Singh asked the woman and her younger daughter to come with him to a nearby village for some work, said Desai.He then took the mother-daughter duo to the forest and killed them, the police officer added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-man-kills-live-in-partner-daughter-dumps-bodies-in-sewer-212795
15-02-2021||New Delhi||Union Jal Shakti Ministry makes push for conservation of Ganga wetlands||The Union Jal Shakti Ministry has made a push for revival and conservation of the wetlands in the Ganga River basin to further shore up its clean-Ganga Mission-a flagship programme of the Centre.The Ministry has asked the Deputy Commissioners of the districts concerned in the basin states through its National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) to identify the wetlands which are in various stages of disintegration.“A road map to protect the wetlands has been jointly prepared along  World Wide Fund for Nature-India,” NMCG Director-General Rajiv Ranjan Mishra said. The roadmap includes an engagement programme to support and empower the District Ganga Committees (DGCs) with an aim to promote rejuvenation and conservation of urban and rural wetlands at the district level. “This engagement is expected to result in a long-term partnership with the DGCs, which will help achieve the objectives of 'aviral dhara' as envisaged by the Namami Gange programme.”The wetlands play a crucial role in the overall hydrology of a river’s basin region, and contribute to water flows underground and in rivers.Since this inter-linkage between wetland and river health is not well understood by stakeholders, wetland conservation is not integrated in river basin managementWetlands are among the most crucial sources of freshwater. They are also among the most productive ecosystems on the planet and render many ecosystem services, including improvement in the quality and quantity of surface and groundwater, protection against floods and droughts, nutrient recycling. Also, they are important biodiversity habitat.India is extremely rich with regard to its wetland diversity, spanning from alpine wetlands in the Himalayas to mangroves in the coastal regions and corals in the sea and near the shore.As per the Ganga River Management Plan 2015, there are many lakes, tanks and marshes in the National River Ganga Basin. An integral part of the Central Asian Flyway, the Ganga basin has sixteen Ramsar sites. Nearly 50 of the 170 nationally important wetlands are located in the Ganga basin, along with around 116 High Altitude Wetlands of Uttarakhand, and numerous rural and urban wetlands.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-jal-shakti-ministry-makes-push-for-conservation-of-ganga-wetlands-212794

15-02-2021||Lucknow||Government insulted farmers, ministers called them traitors: Priyanka Gandhi||Accusing the Narendra Modi-led Union government of insulting farmers, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday said the men who protect the country’s borders are sons of farmers.Addressing a “kisan panchayat” in UP’s Bijnore, the Congress leader said farmers were ridiculed in Parliament and dubbed as traitors by ministers.“The farmer who is standing on your door, his son is standing at the border of the country. The farmer whom you are insulting, his son is safeguarding the country’s border,” she said referring to the protest against the farm laws at the Delhi borders.“They were given a new name ‘aandolanjivi’ and ‘parijivi’. All of you know the meaning of ‘parijivi’. Your ministers called the farmers traitors,” she said.Priyanka also criticised Haryana minister J P Dalal, who had stoked a controversy on Saturday saying the farmers who died during the course of the agitation would have passed away even if they had stayed back home.Stressing that “martyrdom” is a significant thing, she said, “No one has the right to raise a finger on a person who has attained martyrdom while protesting for his rights, be it the prime minister or any other minister”.   Attacking the prime minister, the Congress leader alleged that the central laws are not for farmers but for his capitalist friends.“The country is not blind and every citizen is watching as to what is happening in the country for the past seven years. His capitalist friends are running the entire media, his capitalist friends run his elections,” she said.“All big industries set up in the past 75 years have been sold and plans are afoot to sell the unsold ones. What will such a government do for you,” Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asked.Further lashing out at the PM, she said, “The prime minister can go to the US, hold a gathering for Trump (ex-US president), visit China and Pakistan, and there is no country which he has not visited. And you could not go two-three kilometres from your house and meet the farmers who are saying please come and talk to us”. “There are two types of leaders. There are some leaders who have a lot of arrogance and they forget as to who gave them power. In the history of the country, whenever a leader has become arrogant, the people of the country have taught him a lesson, and he feels ashamed.Then he understands what his religion is. His religion is not to divide people but to work for their development. Top priority should be given to the public and you (leader) should be behind them,” she said.After the Congress leader ended her speech, a two-minute silence was observed for the farmers who died during the course of the protest.The farmer unions protesting against the centre’s farm laws have claimed that over 200 farmers have died during the course of the agitation that started in November last year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-insulted-farmers-ministers-called-them-traitors-priyanka-gandhi-212785

Manvinder got multiple bank accounts opened for Kapil and Sajid using fake documents, for which he received a commission. The cheated amount was transferred to Waris’ account,” the officer said.According to the police, the victim had put up a sofa for sale on an e-commerce platform.She was approached by a man who showed interest in making the purchase.To check if the account details shared by her were correct, he initially transferred a minimal amount of money into her account.Subsequently, the man sent a QR code to the seller and asked her to scan it so that the amount fixed under the deal could be transferred to her account but instead, Rs 20,000 got deducted from her account when she followed the instructions of the buyer, a senior police officer said.When she enquired about it, the man claimed that he had sent a wrong QR code by mistake and sent another link to her, asking her to follow the same procedure.But again an amount of Rs 14,000 got deducted from the seller’s account when she scanned the QR code, the officer said.An FIR under the relevant sections of the IPC was registered on February 7.During scrutiny of bank account details and transactions, it emerged that the money was withdrawn from an account registered in the name of Kapil at Agra, the officer said.Police said the gang had duped several others.

No amount of praise can be enough for your act of selflessness. The virtues of sacrifice and compassion have always been central to our culture and traditions," he replied to her.Noting that organ donation is the biggest donation as the person receiving it gets a new lease of life, he said in our country where lakhs of people are in such a need, there can be no greater donation than this."Your act of generosity is inspirational. It will motivate many to come forward and strengthen the humanitarian cause of organ donation," the prime minister wrote to Halder.       Our collective effort towards spreading more awareness and making organ donation a people's movement will surely help the needful receive the best of help in true sense, he said.       Halder said both she and the person who she donated her kidney have been doing fine.

15-02-2021||New Delhi||SC grants 5-day bail to Siddique Kappan to visit ailing mother in Kerala||The Supreme Court on Monday granted five-day interim bail to journalist Siddique Kappan, arrested on his way to Hathras where a young Dalit woman had died after being allegedly gang-raped, to visit his ailing mother.A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde, however, said during his visit he would not give any interview to the media, including social media.The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said Kappan would not meet members of the public except his relatives and doctors concerned.It said he would be escorted by a team of Uttar Pradesh police officers and police in Kerala would cooperate with them.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ), stated that Kappan’s mother could not talk on video conference and the doctors have said she might live only for two or three more days.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Uttar Pradesh government, however, said the condition of Kappan’s mother was not as serious as was being projected and no medical certificates were provided.“There are posters in Kerala and the wife of Kappan is collecting money in his name as if he is a martyr... When he goes to Kerala to visit his mother political opinions would be formed,” Mehta said.The bench said it was taking Sibal’s statements on face value and “we will not allow him (Kappan) to be paraded and he will go to his house under protection of armed guards”.On November 16 last year, the top court had sought a response from the Uttar Pradesh government on the plea challenging the arrest of the journalist on his way to Hathras.Sibal had sought bail for the journalist saying that there was nothing against him in the FIR lodged at Mathura by UP Police.The FIR has been filed under various provisions of the IPC and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against four people having alleged links with the Popular Front of India (PFI).The PFI had been accused in the past of funding protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act across the country earlier this year.Kappan was arrested on October 5 while he was on his way to Hathras, home to the young Dalit woman who died after being gang-raped, allegedly by four upper-caste men.The KUWJ had filed a habeas corpus petition in the top court against the arrest of the journalist and it also sought his immediate production and release from “illegal detention”.The police, however, had said it had arrested four people having links with the Popular Front of India in Mathura, and identified the arrested persons as Siddique from Malappuram, Atiq-ur Rehman from Muzaffarnagar, Masood Ahmed from Bahraich and Alam from Rampur.Hours after the arrest, the prominent journalist body of Kerala identified Malappuram native Siddique by his full name as Siddique Kappan, saying he is a senior Delhi-based journalist.The plea stated that the arrest was made in violation of the mandatory guidelines laid down by the apex court and with the sole intention of obstructing the discharge of duty by a journalist.The petition alleged that family members or colleagues have not been informed of his arrest.Hathras has been in the news following the death of a 19-year-old Dalit woman who was allegedly gang-raped on September 14, 2020, in a village in the district.

Venugopal, Govind Singh Dotasara and Rahul Gandhi.Pilot was very much present on the stage when the announcement was made.As Rahul Gandhi started speaking, Pilot and Maken spoke to each other and both of them stepped down from the stage. This incident has been linked with the move to get Sachin Pilot off the stage.Pramod Krishnam recently triggered speculation by showering blessings on former Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot to become the Chief Minister of Rajasthan in the future."Mukhyamantri Bhavah" (May you become the CM): Acharya Pramod Krishnam tweeted while replying to Pilot's tweet which had a photo-video of a farmers' rally taken out in Bayana on February 9. The video showed a mammoth crowd listening to Pilot during the Kisan Mahapanchayat.Pilot, along with his supporting MLAs, has been organising Kisan Mahapanchayats in Rajasthan which are receiving a huge response. The initiative has been taken to stand in solidarity with farmers protesting against the three contentious Central farm laws.Pramod Krishnam, in fact, also asked Gehlot, who tweeted asking "young generation to come forward in the #JoinCongressSocialMedia campaign". The spiritual guru asked Gehlot whether he was referring to Sachin Pilot via the tweet.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priyankas-close-aide-flags-pilots-removal-from-dais-at-rahuls-rally-212762

A surge of water in Dhauliganga and Rishiganga rivers had ripped through two hydel projects.Asked about the chances of survival of those missing or trapped, the district magistrate said, "We must always try to be hopeful when the circumstances are adverse." Around 30 people, who were at work inside the tunnel when the flashflood occurred, are believed to be trapped inside the SFT at Tapovan.The last rites of those pulled out dead after DNA sampling and other formalities have also been going on and compensation cheques are also being distributed among the next of kin of the deceased.Families of those from outside Chamoli district killed in the tragedy are being paid compensation of Rs 4 lakh each through bankers’ cheques by the district administration concerned.Over 500 ration kits carrying foodgrains and essentials have already been distributed among residents of over a dozen villages that were cut off from the district headquarters following the disaster that struck a week ago.Electricity supply has been restored in all affected villages except Pang where solar lanterns have been provided to residents for the time being, she said.The agencies involved in the Tapovan rescue work include the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, the National Disaster Response Force and the State Disaster Response Force.

In vegetables and potatoes, it was (-) 20.82 per cent and 22.04 per cent respectively.Core inflation rose to a 27-month high of 5.1 per cent in January 2021.In non-food articles, inflation was higher at 4.16 per cent, while in the fuel and power basket it was (-) 4.78 per cent, during the month under review.ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said a deeper disinflation in primary food articles helped to cushion the impact of the sharp rise in core inflation.Rising demand and strengthening pricing power will make core inflation rise further to as much as 7-7.5 per cent during April-June quarter, according to ICRA.“... the headline WPI inflation is set to record large upticks over the course of the next few months. We now expect the WPI inflation to average 5-5.5 per cent in FY2022, unless the available vaccines turn out to be ineffective against new COVID-19 variants, causing commodity prices, consumer confidence and business sentiment to plunge,” Nayar added.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its monetary policy decision on February 5, kept interest rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive meeting and said that the outlook for core inflation is influenced by the escalation in cost-push pressures seen in recent months.Petroleum product prices have reached historic highs as international crude prices surged in recent months and the high indirect taxes remain, both in the Centre and States. These, along with the sharp increase in industrial raw material prices have resulted in a broad-based increase in prices of services and manufacturing products in recent months.“Going forward, concerted policy action by both Centre and States, is critical to ensure that the ongoing cost build-up does not escalate further,” the RBI had said.Data released last week showed retail inflation, based on the consumer price index, was at 4.06 per cent in January.“We expect the CPI inflation to have bottomed out in January 2021, with large upticks expected in the next two prints. This, combined with the anticipated hardening in the core-WPI inflation, reaffirms our view that there is no room for further rate cuts in this cycle,” Nayar added.

15-02-2021||New Delhi||Indian-origin UK minister in India for climate talks||Alok Sharma, an Indian-origin Minister in the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Cabinet, on Monday arrived here for two days of climate discussions with Indian leaders.Sharma, the COP26 President-Designate to lead the crucial UN climate talks, will meet senior Indian Ministers, as well as leaders from business and civil society, to  discuss strengthening the UK-India climate partnership and preparing for a successful COP26 summit later this year.In his first visit to Asia as COP (Conference of the Parties) President, Sharma is expected to welcome India's significant progress on climate action and clean energy transition, an official statement by New Delhi-based British High Commission said.He will highlight Prime Minister Narendra Modi's global leadership in setting up the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), the latter of which the UK is proud to co-chair.India's expertise is expected to be of great value to global discussions on a clean energy transition as part of COP preparations, it said.In his meetings with business, Sharma will highlight the huge opportunities in the low carbon economy, celebrate existing commitments to achieve net zero emissions and encourage influential businesses to promote the growing movement of corporate climate action throughout their sector and supply chain.Sharma will also meet with civil society, including experts and young thinkers, to discuss challenges and possible solutions to climate change, and to hear how they are trying to mobilise younger generations in support of climate action.After a year of virtual meetings, the in-person visit signals a step-change in momentum to COP26 or UN climate change conference preparations, and reinforces Sharma's ambition to run an inclusive negotiating process that incorporates the views of all countries.Sharma said: "When it comes to climate action, India is a key partner and a global leader. Together we can make change happen -- delivering real progress on reducing emissions and building global commitments."The UK and India are already a joint force for good against climate change, and we look forward to strengthening this partnership in the run up to COP26 and beyond." High Commissioner to India, Alex Ellis CMG said: "Alok Sharma's visit is the latest step in protecting our planet by making COP26 a success and will further develop the UK-India climate partnership on clean and resilient development."Hearing from the Indian government first hand, as well as civil society and business will be essential in informing the approach of the UK Presidency as we work towards a comprehensive, ambitious and balanced outcome at COP26."Sharma's visit follows those of the UK Foreign Secretary and International Trade Secretary, and paves the way for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's visit later this year, during which climate cooperation will be a focus.As host of COP26, the UK is setting a strong example on climate action, with a legally binding target to cut emissions to net zero by 2050.Between 1990 and 2018, the UK nearly halved emissions whilst growing the economy by 75 per cent, and will cut coal use in the power sector entirely by 2025.The UK has committed to double its International Climate Finance to at least £11.6bn over the next five years, to help developing countries to take action.The UK's Presidency of COP26 in 2021 and India's Presidency of the G20 in 2023 provide important platforms for driving global action and implementing the Paris Agreement.India and the UK share many common priorities on climate action and are working closely together to ensure action in the run-up to COP26 and beyond.Priority themes at COP26 with great potential for collaboration include: adaptation and resilience; corporate action; green finance; clean growth and technology; and nature-based solutions.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-origin-uk-minister-in-india-for-climate-talks-212740

15-02-2021||Bhawanipatna||Another elephant found dead in Karlapat sanctuary, 6 jumbos die in 14 days||Another female elephant was found dead near a waterbody at Karlapat Wildlife sanctuary in Odisha’s Kalahandi district, a Forest official said.With the latest jumbo death, six elephants five female and a calf - have died at Karlapat Wildlife sanctuary within 14 days of this month, the official said.According to the 2018 census the sanctuary had 17 elephants.Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Kalahandi South Division Ashok Kumar and his team and veterinary doctors are camping in the area undertaking surveillance. “The death of elephants is due to Haemorrhage Septicemia (HS),” the DFO said.However, the DFO said that there was no such report about the death of other animals in the sanctuary and also the cattle entering the forest from nearby villages.Coordinator from Centre for Wildlife Health, OUAT (Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology), Bhubaneswar, Niranjan Sahu after visiting Karlapat sanctuary said: “The death of elephants is believed to be by HS. The postmortem report and laboratory report of one dead elephant is hinting at HS (Haemorrhage Septicemia).Cattle do get infected by HS if not vaccinated, Sahu said, adding that this is perhaps the first incident where elephants are also infected with HS.He said vaccination of domesticated cattle in the villages located inside the sanctuary and sanitization is in progress by veterinary staff supported by forest staff.Chief District Veterinary Officer (CDVO) Dr Chaitanya Sethi said that as of now there is no reported death of domesticated cattle in the area due to HS. During October there was vaccination but given the present scenario, further vaccination cover is in progress by veterinary staff now.Local people and wildlife lovers, however, do not take the incident lightly. Pramod Kumar Singhdeo, a local from Karlapat belonging to the erstwhile Zamindar family of Karlapat and having in-depth knowledge on the flora fauna of the locality, said: “The forest department has dug salt ponds in different places to provide salted drinking water to the wild animals.”The possibility of poachers poisoning some ponds to kill wild animals cannot be ruled out, he said demanding an investigation into the matter.“The water from the salt ponds should be sent for laboratory analysis to ascertain the fact. It may also happen that the cattle infected with HS might have transmitted infection in the salt pond which affected the elephants also,” he said.However, forest department officials rejected the second argument saying that no domestic cattle are found to have the HS infection.Another local person claimed that though the forest department had earlier installed CCTV Cameras in several spots to monitor the movement of wild animals, those were removed for unknown reasons.Karlapat Wildlife Sanctuary is spread over 175 square kilometre area and is famous for the lush green dry deciduous forest, varieties of flora and fauna and animals like elephant, leopard, Gaur, Sambar, barking deer, Indian wolf, wild dog, wild pig, sloth bear, Malabar giant squirrel and Pangolin.This apart a variety of birds like peafowl, peacock, hornbill, Red jungle fowl, partridges, Spurfawl, Hill Myna, Brahminy kite and reptilian fauna includes Mugger, crocodile, monitor lizard, snakes both poisonous and non-poisonous are found in the sanctuary.The forest consists of flora like Sal, Bija, Asan, Harida, Amala, Bahada and Bamboo and varieties of medicinal plants.This sanctuary was first notified in 1969 by the conservator of Forest and was formally notified under the Wild Life Protection Act of 1972 in 1992. The undulated topography of the sanctuary, with hills, valleys and perennial streams including Sagada river and its tributaries with deep water pools in places gives it a unique charm, officials said.There are several small and big waterfalls inside the sanctuary like Phurlijharan, Ghusrigudi, Dumnijhola, Kamalajharan, Koyirupa, Kuang and Raja Rani. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/another-elephant-found-dead-in-karlapat-sanctuary-6-jumbos-die-in-14-days-212717

His role and links with the realty group are being investigated, they said.Joshi is expected to be produced before a local court here on Monday where the ED would seek his remand for custodial interrogation, they said.The central probe agency last month had arrested Omkar Relators and Developers chairman Kamal Kishore Gupta and managing director Babulal Varma after raids were carried out against them and the group.The PMLA case pertains to alleged irregularities in the execution of the SRA (slum rehabilitation authority) scheme in development of a housing society in Mumbai.The company and the two executives are also facing allegations of “diverting” over Rs 400 crore loan from Yes Bank.The ED case has been filed after studying an FIR of Aurangabad (Maharashtra) district police that was registered under various sections of the IPC like cheating and criminal breach of trust, the agency had said earlier.The ED had quoted the police FIR to say that “Omkar Realtors and Developers Private Limited and its directors bought a firm ‘Surana Construction’ which had SRA rights for re-development of Anand Nagar SRA Cooperative Housing Society in Mumbai's Wadala area”.“However, Omkar and its promoters did not pay back the amount due to the seller and also mortgaged future FSI (floor space index) of the said SRA project and took huge amounts of loans,” it said.The ED also claimed that its probe found that “loans of Rs 410 crore were diverted and not used for intended purposes”.“No work of SRA building was undertaken. The requisite rules and procedures under SRA were ignored by the accused and documents relating to names of slum dwellers were forged to claim more FSI for mortgaging the same with banks for taking the loans,” the ED had alleged.Reacting to the arrests of its top executives last month, the company had said that it was “emphatic that Omkar Group is not in violation of any lending norms and slum approvals”.

Addressing a public rally at Sivasagar district, he said his party would protect every principle of the Assam Accord and would never implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act if voted to power in the state. He added that the state needed its “own chief minister” who would listen to the voice of the people and not the one who listens only to Nagpur (RSS headquarters) and Delhi. He alleged that natural resources and PSUs in the state were being “sold off” to the two leading businessmen of the country. “The Assam Accord has brought peace and it is the protector of the state. I and my party workers will protect each principle of the accord. There will not be a single deviation from it,” he said. Gandhi said illegal immigration was an issue in Assam, but exuded confidence that the people of the state had the capability to resolve the issue through dialogue. He also alleged that the BJP and RSS were trying to divide the state on Assam Accord. He, however, said, “No power in the world can break Assam.” All party leaders, including Gandhi, were seen wearing “gamocha” (Assamese scarf), where symbolically the CAA word was crossed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-not-allow-divisive-caa-in-assam-rahul-at-poll-rally-212511

It also cited challenges in negotiating new projects with foreign cooperation.Apart from the six PHWRs, the government has sanctioned 10 more to be set up in fleet mode. Pre-project activities are in progress in respect of these 10 PHWRs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nuclear-power-capacity-to-treble-by-2031-govt-212513
15-02-2021||---||Bihar poll: SC notice to CEC, politicians on contempt plea||New Delhi, February 14 The Supreme Court has issued notices to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora and leaders of various political parties on a contempt petition highlighting their alleged failure to publish criminal antecedents of candidates, as ordered by the court, during the November 2020 Bihar Assembly elections. A Bench headed by Justice Rohinton F Nariman asked the CEC, Bihar, Chief Electoral Officer (HR) Srinivas, BJP organising secretary BL Santosh, JDU general secretary KC Tyagi, Bihar RJD president, Jagdanand Singh, LJP’s Abdul Khalik and Congress leader RS Surjewala. The top court, however, dispensed with the personal appearance of the contemnors. It posted the matter for further hearing on March 9. Taking note of alarming rise in the number of tainted lawmakers, the SC, on February 13 last year, ordered political parties to upload details of pending criminal cases against their candidates and the reasons for their selection. These details were required to be published within 48 hours of the selection of the candidate or at least two weeks before the commencement of filing of nominations, whichever is earlier. Petitioner Brajesh Singh alleged the top court’s order was not followed as criminal antecedents of candidates were not published by political parties. In its February 13, 2020, order, a Bench led by Justice Nariman had directed parties to publish such details on their official social media platforms and one local vernacular and one national newspaper. It had also asked political parties to give reasons for selecting candidates having pending criminal cases with reference to their qualification, achievements and not merely on “winnability”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-poll-sc-notice-to-cec-politicians-on-contempt-plea-212518

15-02-2021||Washington||Senate acquits Trump||The US Senate has acquitted a defiant Donald Trump in his second impeachment trial in just over a year after the Democrats failed once again to muster enough votes to convict the former president on a charge of inciting the deadly insurrection at the Capitol on January 6.Democracy is fragileJoe Biden, US PresidentThe Senate voted 57-43 on Saturday to convict Trump on a single impeachment count – incitement of insurrection. But that majority of all 50 Democrats in the upper chamber of the US Congress, joined by seven Republicans, fell 10 votes short of the 67 needed for a conviction, two-thirds of the 100-member Senate.The Senate acquitted the 74-year-old Republican leader of inciting insurrection at the US Capitol last month after he urged hundreds of his supporters to confront lawmakers as they were certifying that he had lost the November 3 presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden.He was accused of inciting riots in the Capitol which left five people, including a police officer, dead.Trump is the first president in US history to be impeached by the House of Representatives twice, and the first to be tried for impeachment after leaving office.He was first acquitted by the Senate on February 5, 2020, on charges of abuse of power and on obstruction of Congress. The Democrats had charged Trump in December 2019 with pressuring Ukraine to smear Biden, his rival in the November election.On Saturday, seven Republican senators voted in favour of impeaching Trump. If he had been convicted, the Senate could have voted to bar Trump, who has not yet conceded defeat to Biden, from running for office ever again.Minutes after the verdict was announced, Trump released a statement, saying “no president has ever gone through anything like it”. Based in his resort in Florida, he denounced the trial as “the greatest witch hunt in history”.In his first reaction to the development, President Biden said that the Senate's acquittal of his predecessor was a reminder that democracy was “fragile” and every American had a duty to defend the truth.“This sad chapter in our history has reminded us that democracy is fragile. That it must always be defended. That we must be ever vigilant. That violence and extremism have no place in America. And that each of us has a duty and responsibility as Americans, and especially as leaders, to defend the truth and to defeat the lies,” Biden said in a statement.While the final vote did not lead to the conviction of Trump, the substance of the charge was not in dispute, he said.“Even those opposed to the conviction, like Senate Minority Leader McConnell, believe Donald Trump was guilty of a “disgraceful dereliction of duty” and “practically and morally responsible for provoking” the violence unleashed on the Capitol,” Biden said.The Democratic Party criticised the Republican senators for acquitting Trump, saying their vote to clear him “will live as a vote of infamy in the history of the US Senate”. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/senate-acquits-trump-212524
15-02-2021||---||It’s sheer surrender: Antony on LAC disengagement||New Delhi, February 14Former Defence Minister AK Antony today alleged that the terms of disengagement in both Galwan valley and Pangong Tso areas and the creation of a buffer zone was a “surrender” of India’s interests. He accused the Centre of appeasing China by “agreeing to dis-engagment on China’s terms”.Addressing a press conference, he said, “Please understand the gravity of the situation, disengagement is good but it cannot be at the cost of national security.” He asked the government to disclose its plan to restore status quo ante as on April 2020 along the LAC.“The government is not realising the danger of creating such buffer zones,” he said. The Army had occupied Kailash range in south of Pangong Tso. “In negotiations, we have agreed to withdraw from there. It could have been a bargaining chip,” he said.“The area between Finger 4 and Finger 8 was disputed and both armies used to patrol it. There had been incidents of jostling among troops of both countries, but India always maintained it claim up to Finger 8,” he said.Quoting Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s statement in Parliament, he said, “Now, we have agreed to come back to Finger 3.”“Our Army has a post at Finger 4, why has that been vacated and why has the right to patrol up to Finger 8 been surrendered,” he said.“Galwan was never a point of dispute. It was always a part and parcel of India. For the first time, a buffer zone has been created there,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/its-sheer-surrender-antony-on-lac-disengagement-212514

The National Conference leader also asked under which law he had been "detained"."This is the 'naya/new J&K' after August 2019. We get locked up in our homes with no explanation.

But assuming it is, please tell me under which law you have detained me in my home today? You can advise me not to leave my house but you can't force me to stay in using security as an excuse," the former CM tweeted."Please share the written communication addressed to me and acknowledged by me (or my office), informing us in advance of these restrictions.

15-02-2021||Tapovan/Dehradun||Rescuers pull out 6 bodies from Tapovan tunnel, 7 from other locations; toll rises to 51||Rescue teams on Sunday recovered 13 more bodies, including the first ones to be pulled out from the sludge-choked Tapovan tunnel where a massive operation to reach about 30 people trapped inside began after a flash flood in Chamoli district a week ago.Six bodies were recovered from the Tapovan power project tunnel, six from Raini upstream and one from the riverbank in Rudraprayag, taking the confirmed death toll in the Uttarakhand disaster to 51.Officials said over 150 people still remain missing after the February 7 devastation, possibly triggered by an avalanche in the upper reaches of the Alaknanda river system. A surge of water in Dhauliganga and Rishiganga rivers had ripped through two hydel projects.Bodies of victims were being found at different locations by the river over the past week, but rescuers had so far failed to reach anyone – dead or alive – in the tunnel network at the National Thermal Power Corporation’s 520 MW Tapovan-Vishnugad project.Chamoli District Magistrate Swati S Bhadauria and Superintendent of Police Yashwant Singh Chauhan rushed to the tunnel when the first two bodies were brought out in the early hours of Sunday.Three more bodies were recovered later from the tunnel, which is packed with debris brought by the flash flood.Officials said a helicopter has been kept on standby at the Tapovan rescue site to quickly fly out survivors, if there are any, for medical treatment.Rescuers are also continuing with an alternative approach—trying to widen a hole they have drilled into another interconnected tunnel from where the trapped men could perhaps be reached.The men found dead Sunday were identified as Alam Singh from Tehri, Anil (Dehradun district) Jitendra Kumar (Jammu), Shesh Nath (Faridabad), JItendra Dhanai (Tehri), Suraj Thakur (Kushinagar) Jugal Kishore (Punjab), Rakesh Kapur (Himachal Pradesh), Harpal Singh (Chamoli), Ved Prakash (Gorakhpur), Dhanurdhari (Gorakhpur).The bodies were kept at a temporary mortuary at Tapovan, officials said.The Chamoli DM said about 445 people stranded after the flash flood have so far been sent to their villages using helicopters. Over 500 ration kits have been distributed in the affected areas.Medical camps put up in the affected villages have so far treated 998 patients.The process of cremating the victims after taking their DNA samples continued in Chamoli district. Two bodies and four severed limbs were cremated on Sunday.The agencies involved in the Tapovan rescue work include the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, the National Disaster Response Force and the State Disaster Response Force. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rescuers-pull-out-6-bodies-from-tapovan-tunnel-7-from-other-locations-toll-rises-to-51-212289
