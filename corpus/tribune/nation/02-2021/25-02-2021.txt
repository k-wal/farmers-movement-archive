Later, he was sent to seven-day police custody.Currently, he is undergoing judicial custody in the matter.Delhi Police had earlier told the Court that Deep Sidhu was the main instigator. He allegedly instigated the mob not to follow the permitted route of the Kisan parade and to breach barricades with tractors on January 26.Farmers have been protesting at the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. — ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/deep-sidhu-moves-delhi-court-seeking-fair-probe-against-him-in-r-day-violence-case-217462
25-02-2021||New Delhi||Ignoring merit in public job selection violation of Constitution: SC||Selections to public employment should be on the basis of merit and appointing people with lesser merit ignoring those who have secured more marks would be in violation of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has said.A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Indira Banerjee made the observation while upholding an order of Jharkhand High Court which allowed appointment of 43 persons for post of Police Sub-Inspectors on the basis of their merit after authorities prepared a revised select list correcting the irregularities.An advertisement was issued for the appointment to the posts of Police Sub-Inspectors, Attendants (Sergeant) and Company Commanders by the Home Department of the Government of Jharkhand in 2008.The final result was published and 382 candidates were selected but later a High Level Committee was constituted by the state government to examine the irregularities in the selection process.Unsuccessful candidates filed petitions in the High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi.During the pendency of the petitions in the high court, the appointments of 42 candidates made on the basis of the original select list were cancelled.As many as 43 people were appointed on the basis of the revised select list that was prepared in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee headed by the Director General of Police, Jharkhand.The high court had observed that 43 petitioners cannot be held responsible for the irregularities committed by the authorities in the matter of their selection and there is no allegation of fraud or misrepresentation on their part.The top court rejected the plea filed by some intervenors saying that they have no right for appointment to posts beyond those advertised.“There is no doubt that selections to public employment should be on the basis of merit. Appointment of persons with lesser merit ignoring those who have secured more marks would be in violation of the Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution of India,” the bench said in last week's judgment.It said relief granted to 43 petitioners is mainly on the ground that they have already been appointed and have served the State for some time and they cannot be punished for no fault of theirs.“The intervenors are not similarly situated to them and they cannot seek the same relief. The other ground taken by the intervenors in the petitions before us is that relief was denied to them only on the basis of a wrong statement made on behalf of the State Government that there were no vacancies,” the bench said.“No doubt, the intervenors have placed on record material to show that there was no shortage of vacancies for their appointment. One of the reasons given by the High Court for not granting relief to the intervenors is lack of vacancies. However, we are not inclined to direct appointment of the intervenors as selections pertain to an advertisement issued in 2008,” the bench said.

25-02-2021||New Delhi||Quality of evidence relevant in criminal trial, not quantity: SC||It is the quality of evidence which is relevant in a criminal trial, not the quantity, the Supreme Court said on Thursday while dismissing an appeal filed by a man accused of murder about 30 years ago.A three-judge bench headed by Justice RF Nariman said merely because a prosecution witness was not believed in respect of another accused, his testimony could not be disregarded.The top court said a part of the statement of a witness could be believed even though some part of the statement may not be relied upon by the court.Also read: After spending 20 years in jail, UP man found ‘wrongly convicted’The maxim, ‘Falsus in Uno, Falsus in Omnibus’, (false in one thing, false in everything) was not the rule applied by the courts in India, it said.“It is not necessary for the prosecution to examine all witnesses who might have witnessed the occurrence. It is the quality of evidence which is relevant in criminal trial and not the quantity,” said the bench, also comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and BR Gavai.The observations came on an appeal filed by UP resident Ram Vijay Singh against the order passed by the Allahabad High Court convicting him for an offence under Section 302 (murder) read with Section 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code in the 1982 case.The apex court also rejected his claim of juvenility in the absence of any reliable trustworthy medical evidence to find out age of the appellant.It said the ossification test conducted in 2020 when the appellant was 55 years old could not be conclusive to declare him as a juvenile on the date of the incident.The court also rejected his submission that Girendra Singh, the brother of the deceased, was not examined by prosecution though as per Ram Naresh Singh (Prosecution Witness-1), he was walking few steps behind the deceased.

The conversation will also be live streamed on Facebook for viewers around the world,” the statement said.According to the university, Gandhi and Basu will compare notes on the Indian economy and the outlook for democracy in India and around the world.Basu is the Carl Marks Professor of International Studies, professor of economics in the College of Arts and Sciences, and former senior vice president and chief economist of the World Bank.“India and the world are at a turning point with the pandemic, pollution and polarised politics. I am excited about this conversation because while as an economist, I observe what is happening from outside, Rahul Gandhi has the insider’s advantage,” Basu said.The discussion, the university said, is part of the Einaudi Center’s research focus on global democratic resilience.“The Einaudi Center is thrilled to host this important conversation,” said Rachel Beatty Riedl, Einaudi’s director and John S Knight Professor of International Studies and professor in the Department of Government in the College of Arts and Sciences.“It highlights critical questions, such as who benefits from growth and how an inclusive political community that prioritises social services for all can be forged,” Riedl said.

25-02-2021||New Delhi||INS asks Google to compensate Indian newspapers for using their content||The Indian Newspaper Society (INS) on Thursday asked Google to compensate Indian newspapers for using their content and insisted that the global search giant increase the publisher share of advertising revenue to 85 per cent.In a letter to Google, INS president L Adimoolam said publishers are also facing a very opaque advertising system, as they are unable to get details of Google’s advertising value chain.“The Society insisted that Google should increase the publisher share of advertising revenue to 85 per cent, and also ensure more transparency in the revenue reports provided to publishers by Google,” the INS said in a statement.It noted that, over the past year publishers across the world have been raising the issue of fair payment for content and of proper sharing of advertising revenue with Google.It is also noted that Google has recently agreed to better compensate and pay publishers in France, the European Union and notably in Australia.In a letter addressed to Google India’s country manager Sanjay Gupta, the INS president demanded that Google should pay for news generated by the newspapers which employ thousands of journalists on the ground, at considerable expense, for gathering and verifying information.“Since, the content which is generated and published by newspapers at considerable expense is proprietary, the Society pointed out that it is this credible content which has given Google the authenticity in India ever since its inception,” the INS said.It pointed out that publishers have been providing complete access to “quality journalism with credible news, current affairs, analysis, information and entertainment”, and “there is a huge distinction between the editorial content from quality publications and fake news that is spreading on other information platforms”.Further, it was also pointed out that advertising has been the financial backbone of the news industry. However, newspaper publishers are seeing their share of the advertising pie shrinking in the digital space, even as Google is taking a “giant share of advertising spends”, leaving publishers with a small share, it said.The INS also raised the issue of giving greater prominence to editorial content from Registered News Publishers to tackle fake news, as Google picks up content from several sites that are not credible, thus “amplifying misinformation and propagation of fake news”.Pointing out that the Society is engaged in discussions with Google on these vital issues, the letter also reiterated that “Indian print media is the most credible source of news and information in the country, and newspapers play a vital role in nation building. However, the pandemic and the current digital business model have been unfair to publishers, making it unviable for the print media industry. We invest heavily on journalism, the core of our news operations, because newspapers play a vital role in society.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ins-asks-google-to-compensate-indian-newspapers-for-using-their-content-217449
25-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||Modi continues with spree of infraprojects in poll-bound Puducherry, Tamil Nadu||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 25With infrastructure development as the centerpiece of his politics in the upcoming Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi continued with the spree of inaugurations and announcements of infrastructure projects in poll-bound Puducherry and Tamil Nadu.Addressing public meetings in Puducherry and Coimbatore, he also accused the Congress of “lying” and slammed the DMK for the way it treated “Amma” Jayalalithaa.“The entire Tamil Nadu knows how the DMK treated ‘Amma’ Jayalalithaa. Those who troubled Jayalalithaa were rewarded (by the Congress),” he said.He also took a jibe at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for questioning the Centre for not having an exclusive ministry for fishermen.“Congress leaders would win gold, silver and bronze medals for telling lies,” he said in Puducherry.“Our colonial rulers had the policy of divide and rule. Congress has a policy of divide, lie, and rule. Sometimes, their leaders put region against region and community against community,” he said in an apparent reference to Gandhi’s recent ‘north-south’ remarks.In Coimbatore, he talked of a “paradigm shift” in the agriculture sector through the three farm laws brought by his government. The Prime Minister said the three farm laws gave farmers “freedom” and “independence from middlemen”, and also talked of increase in the MSP, including copra, during the NDA’ regime.He called the meetings of the DMK and the Congress “corruption hackathons”. “The NDA’s approach is governance with compassion,” he said, assuring voters of the poll-bound Tamil Nadu — which his party is contesting with the AIADMK.“The aim of the NDA is the welfare of Tamil Nadu, the welfare of Tamil people,” he said, making infrastructure development and welfare schemes the core of his reach-out to voters there.While politically, the Prime Minister is tackling the Opposition in his characteristic manner, in these elections, he is also sending another message through these infrastructure projects — whether it is Kerala, Tamil Nadu or Puducherry in the South, or Assam and West Bengal in the East.The slew of projects that he inaugurated or announced on Thursday included four-laning of NH 45-A, a blood centre at Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER), a minor port under Sagarmala Scheme, a synthetic athletic track at the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex and a 100-bed girls’ hostel at Lawspet for female athletes at Puducherry.Inaugurating the re-built Mairie Building, the Prime Minister said the building would add to the beauty of Beach Promenade and attract more tourists.In Tamil Nadu, he dedicated to the nation the 1000-MW Neyveli New Thermal Power Project and the 709-MW Solar Power Project of NLCIL; laid the foundation stone of a 5-MW grid-connected ground-based solar power plant; the Integrated Command and Control Centers (ICCC) in nine Smart Cities — Coimbatore, Madurai, Salem, Thanjavur, Vellore, Tiruchirappalli, Tiruppur, Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi; and eight-laning of Korampallam Bridge and Rail Over Bridge (ROB) at VO Chidambaranar Port.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-continues-with-spree-of-infraprojects-in-poll-bound-puducherry-tamil-nadu-217447
25-02-2021||Naveen S Garewal||Girl killed by a male friend for talking to other classmates||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, February 25A 19-year-old second-year degree student was killed by her classmate for talking to other boys, in the Narsaraopeta area of Guntur district.  The boy allegedly took the girl to a secluded place on the pretext of “hanging out” and strangled her to death.The accused has confessed to his involvement in the murder and taken into custody, said the police.The incident came to light on Wednesday with the recovery of the girl’s body from near the Palapadu Canal.According to police, the victim and the accused were classmates and the latter was resentful of the girl talking to other boys in the class.Police said the accused picked up the victim from the college on the pretext of hanging out.They went to the Palapadu canal where the boy confronted the girl and objected to her talking to other boys. This led to a heated argument following which the accused choked the girl to death with his foot, said the police.Inspector Y Atchaiah, Narsaraopeta Rural, said, “Preliminary investigation reveals that the accused and the deceased were in a relationship. Suspecting her behaviour, he wanted to confront her and took her to a remote area in Palapadu and killed her by choking her to death with his foot.”The victim’s classmates carried her body to the Narsaraopeta main road and sought justice for the girl. They said they would not cremate the body until justice is delivered.This incident resulted in some tension in and around Narsaraopeta. The students and activists also blocked the main roads.Deputy Superintendent of Police, Narsaraopeta, assured the protesters of filing a case under all relevant sections, including Nirbhaya Act, against the accused.   Telugu Desam Party general secretary Nara Lokesh asked Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to give up his “publicity drama” and take steps to protect women.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/girl-killed-by-a-male-friend-for-talking-to-other-classmates-217441
25-02-2021||New Delhi||Govt will liaise with UK authorities for Nirav Modi’s early extradition: MEA||The government will liaise with the UK authorities for early extradition of Nirav Modi, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Thursday, hours after a British court rejected the fugitive businessman’s plea against being extradited to India.The diamantaire, wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, lost his legal battle against extradition on all grounds as District Judge Samuel Goozee also concluded that there are no human rights concerns that his medical needs would not be addressed as per several Indian government assurances.Read also | PNB scam case: UK judge orders Nirav Modi to be extradited to IndiaReplying to a query during an online media briefing, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said since the Westminster Magistrate’s Court has recommended to the UK Home Secretary for Nirav Modi’s extradition, “the Government of India would liaise with the UK authorities for his early extradition to India.”On the request of the CBI and the ED, Modi’s extradition from the UK was sought in August 2018. He was arrested and produced before the Senior District Judge at Westminster Magistrate’s court on March 20, 2019.Since then he is facing extradition proceedings while in judicial custody.The final hearing in this case was held on January 7-8, 2021, while the Westminster Magistrate’s Court in London earlier in the day pronounced that he be extradited to India to stand trial.“Dismissing the mental health concerns raised by Nirav Modi, the judge observed that Nirav Modi conspired to destroy evidence and intimidate witnesses,” Srivastava said.

25-02-2021||New Delhi||No territory conceded under disengagement pact with China: MEA||India on Thursday said it has not conceded any territory as part of the disengagement agreement with China, and asserted that it has rather enforced observance of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) to prevent any unilateral change in the status quo.At an online media briefing here, Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said there had not been any change in India’s position on the LAC and the mutual redeployment as a result of the disengagement process should not be misrepresented.Asked about the recent agreement on the de-escalation process in Ladakh’s Pangong Lake area, he said the factual position had been very well conveyed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and in a Defence Ministry statement, which he said was aimed at setting the record straight in view of certain misleading and misinformed comments that appeared in the media.“... India has not conceded any territory as a result of this agreement. On the contrary, it has enforced observance and respect for LAC and it has prevented any unilateral change in the status quo,” Srivastava said.Last week, armies of the two countries, which have been locked in a standoff in eastern Ladakh, concluded withdrawal of troops and weapons from north and south banks of Pangong Tso in the high-altitude region.However, issues still remain. During the talks, India is learnt to have insisted on a faster disengagement process in areas like Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang to bring down tension in the region.To a question on a court ruling in the UK on fugitive businessman Nirav Modi’s extradition, Srivastava said the government would liaise with the British authorities for his early extradition.

25-02-2021||New Delhi||Centre ready to resume talks but farmer unions should first respond to govt proposal: Tomar||Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday reiterated that the government is ready to resume talks with protesting farmers but first the unions should respond to its offer to put the three contentious farm laws on hold for one-and-a-half years and set up a joint committee to find solutions.The government and unions have held 11 rounds of talks, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock and end the farmers’ protest. Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders for about three months in protest against the three laws that they say will end state procurement of crops at MSP.“The government is fully sensitive towards farmers. We have held several rounds of talks (with unions). We proposed many amendments as well as keeping the farm reform Acts on hold for 1.5 years and setting up a joint panel to find solutions. But, they have not responded to our proposals,” Tomar said on the sidelines of an event here.Asked whether the government plans to improve its proposal, the minister said, “Farmers should first express their opinion, what they want.”On ‘mahapanchayats’ being held in some states, Tomar said anyone can organise such an event in a democratic country.The minister said the Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the three laws till further orders and set up a committee to find solutions. “We have full faith in the apex court.”Tomar said the three-member panel is meeting various stakeholders and will submit its recommendation after broad consultations.At the same time, the minister said, the government has been trying to resolve the issue and is ready to talk with the protesting unions and find solutions to end the stalemate.Asked about Bharatiya Kisan Union President Naresh Tikait’s comment calling Defence Minister Rajnath Singh a “caged parrot”, Tomar said these types of remarks should not be made by anyone against senior political leaders.Tikait had on Wednesday called Rajnath Singh a “caged parrot” and said the farmers’ issues could be resolved if he is given the freedom to talk with them.Inaugurating a three-day Kisan Mela at IARI campus in the national capital, Tomar highlighted the benefits of the three laws.He said farmers are being given freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country at their price.Tomar also said there will be no central or state tax if farmers sell their produce outside APMC mandis.“What is wrong in these legislations?” he asked.The minister wondered why some farm unions are protesting against the government which has ended the tax system and not against those who impose taxes.Tomar said these three agri reform laws, along with other initiatives like setting up of FPOs, Rs 1 lakh crore farm infrastructure fund and PM-Kisan scheme, will boost farmers’ income and spur growth of the agriculture sector.The minister emphasised on the need for reduction in the cost of production and better price realisation to make agriculture profitable.Minister of State for Agriculture Kailash Choudhary said, “India achieved independence in 1947, but farmers got freedom in 2020.” He asserted that farmers’ land will not be snatched under the contract farming law and said these legislations will be beneficial for the farming community.Choudhary said the Modi government has been taking various initiatives in the farmers’ interest.Three union ministers, including Tomar and Food Minister Piyush Goyal, have so far held 11 rounds of talks with the protesting farmer unions.In the last meeting on January 22, the government’s negotiations with 41 farmer groups hit a roadblock as the unions squarely rejected the Centre’s proposal of putting the laws on suspension.During the 10th round of talks held on January 20, the Centre had offered to suspend the laws for 1-1.5 years and form a joint committee to find solutions, in return for protesting farmers going back to their respective homes from Delhi’s borders.Farmer groups have alleged that these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.On January 11, the Supreme Court had stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse. Bhartiya Kisan Union President Bhupinder Singh Mann had recused himself from the committee appointed by the apex court.Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra) President Anil Ghanwat and agriculture economists Pramod Kumar Joshi and Ashok Gulati, the other members on the panel, have started the consultation process with stakeholders.

25-02-2021||Mathura||Petro products in India getting costlier as crude-producing nations raising prices: Pradhan||Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Thursday said petroleum products in the country are getting costlier due to rising prices of crude by oil-producing nations.“In order to earn more profit in the interest of their countries, crude-supplying countries are increasing the prices of crude,” said Pradhan while speaking to reporters here on the rise in the prices of petroleum products like petrol and diesel in India.He said crude-supplying countries have been requested to desist from the hike in crude prices as it directly affects consumers.They have created an artificial increase in the interest of their own country, he added.“Arbitrarily, you cannot hike the prices as it affects consuming countries,” Pradhan said in reference to oil-producing countries.Owing to bad weather, the production in the US has slowed in the past two-three weeks, Pradhan said.The minister said he expects an improvement in the situation in some time.Now, the basic problem before the government is to provide relief, employment, save the jobs of the employed, make efforts so that people get money as well as improve health services, the minister said.He added that the government has planned to provide free vaccine to poor senior citizens by investing Rs 35,000 crore.Pradhan said finances are required to develop rail, roads and ports, among others. The taxes collected by Union and state governments at present are spent on the development of people, he added.Earlier, the minister laid the foundation stone of a building in Vatsalya Gram here run by Sadhvi Ritambhara, being constructed for the physically challenged, funded by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation under its CSR programme.

25-02-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||India, Pak poised to make more peace gestures||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 25After the understanding between the two armies to hold peace along the line of control (LoC), reopening of trade at Wagah could be the next step to restore civility in Indo-Pak diplomatic ties, said sources here.India and Pakistan had started holding back-channel talks ever since it became clear that Joe Biden would be the next US President. While trade and ceasefire along the LoC are low hanging fruits, the sources said Islamabad is looking at a gesture from India on Kashmir.Read also: India, Pakistan agree to follow all ceasefire pactsResponding to questions, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said on Thursday that India is always ready for talks to address issues, if any. On key issues, the Indian position remains unchanged, he said on being asked if New Delhi was still maintaining its position that terror and talks cannot go together.In back-channel talks, Pakistan is understood to have conveyed that it expects some kind of a statement from India about not changing the demographics in Kashmir to make substantial progress on their mutual differences.Sources said Islamabad has claimed that there is no state-sponsored indulgence of cross-border militancy though a sure giveaway of its involvement has been the tell-tale cover firing on Indian posts to facilitate infiltration.They expect Pakistan to take some more hard action on cross-border terrorism since Biden’s consistent stand ever since he was a Senator two decades back was that this kind of activity was inconsistent with the desire to settle the Kashmir dispute by bilateral talks.A Pakistani gesture, they said, could be along the line of ensuring permanent incarceration of some terrorist masterminds who have consistently wreaked havoc in Kashmir by sending lethal weapons and men across the border.At the same time, sources pointed to the fragility of the ceasefire arrangement, arguing that a similar concurrence in 2018 did not last long because of the absence of gestures that would act as the scaffolding for peace on the border.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) of Pakistan had earlier this month broadcast a brief portion of Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa’s speech in which he had spoken of extending “a hand of peace in all directions”. This was followed by a fall in the volume of fire from across the LoC.Further, Pakistan did not raise Kashmir during the SAARC virtual meeting on the pandemic unlike on previous occasions when it had inserted the bilateral dispute at multilateral fora such as the SCO meet of National Security Advisers which compelled Indian NSA Ajit Doval to stage a symbolic walkout.India has also reciprocated by allowing overflight to Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s special aircraft to use the Indian airspace. This is despite the fact that the last overflight permission by Pakistan to Indian VIPs was given in mid-2019 for then Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj’s special flight. The changes in Kashmir in August 2019 had hardened Pakistani positions and there were no subsequent permissions for special flights by PM Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-pak-poised-to-make-more-peace-gestures-217429
25-02-2021||New Delhi||Social media platforms have to abide by Indian laws: Amit Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said the government is committed to providing a level-playing field to all digital media and OTT platforms but they will have to abide by Indian laws.Shah’s comments came hours after the government announced sweeping regulations for social media firms like Facebook and Twitter as well as OTT platforms such as Netflix, requiring them to remove any content flagged by authorities within 36 hours and set up a complaint redressal mechanism with an officer based in the country.“All social media platforms have to abide by Indian laws. The new rules, announced today, will further empower social media users by institutionalising redressal mechanism and ensuring resolution of their grievances. I applaud @narendramodi ji and @rsprasad ji,” the Home Minister said in a tweet.He said the Narendra Modi government was committed to providing a level-playing field to all digital media and OTT platforms.“The Code of Ethics and 3 tier self regulation for digital media is welcome. I congratulate @narendramodi ji and @PrakashJavdekar ji for these much needed rules,” Shah said in another tweet, using the hashtag #ResponsibleFreedom.The government guidelines also make it mandatory for platforms such as Twitter and WhatsApp to identify the originator of a message that authorities consider to be anti-national and against the country’s security and sovereignty.The rules for digital media and OTT platforms focus more on an in-house self-regulatory mechanism, whereby a robust grievance redressal mechanism is provided while upholding journalistic and creative freedom.

He spent around 10 minutes in the sea water. He is an expert swimmer,” the functionary told PTI.Gandhi, who was wearing a blue T-shirt and khaki trousers, did not remove them before jumping, a source said.He changed his dress after returning to the Thangassery beach.There were 23 fishermen in the boat.Gandhi was also accompanied by four Congress leaders including AICC general secretary K C Venugopal and T N Prathapan.The fishermen served Gandhi bread and fresh fish curry they prepared on the boat.Gandhi, who spent around two-and-a-half hours in the sea, enjoyed the curry cooked by the fishermen.

25-02-2021||New Delhi||Fisherfolk need independent ministry, not just a department: Rahul after PM jibe||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said fisherfolk need an independent fisheries ministry and not just a department within a ministry, responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swipe at him.At a public meeting in Puducherry, the prime minister expressed shock over Gandhi’s statement last week that there was no “dedicated” fisheries ministry. At the time, BJP leaders, including Union ministers, had also taken a swipe at Gandhi.Responding to the prime minister’s swipe, Gandhi tweeted, “Dear PM, Fisherfolk need an independent and dedicated ministry of fisheries, not just a department within a ministry.” “PS- ‘Hum do Humare do’ obviously hurt bad,” he said referring to the jibe he had used against the government recently to allege that it is being run by Modi and his “corporate friends”.Modi, in his remarks in Puducherry, said, “Congress leaders say we will make a fisheries ministry. I was shocked. The truth is, it is the current NDA government that had made a ministry for fisheries in 2019.”In 2019, the Modi government had formed a Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying.In a separate tweet, Gandhi also attacked the government over a media report claiming that the government has started clearing foreign direct investment proposals from China on a case-by-case basis. Gandhi said, “China has understood that Mr Modi buckles under their pressure. They now know they can get whatever they want from him.”  In another tweet, Gandhi also attacked the government over the issue of employment and asked the government to create jobs for the youth.

25-02-2021||Coimbatore||Modi underlines support for farmers; says NDA aims to ensure their dignity||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday sought to underline his government’s commitment for the farmers, saying it has strived to ensure their prosperity and dignity without any dependence on middlemen.In a statement that comes amid the sustained protests by farmers outside Delhi for nearly four months opposing the new Central farm laws, he said the NDA also wanted to bring a paradigm shift in the agricultural sector.For years, small businessmen and small farmers were ignored but the “NDA government has given topmost priority to these two sections,” he said in his address at a public meeting in this western town of poll-bound Tamil Nadu.“It has been our honour to work for the small farmer of India. In the past seven years our efforts for small farmers are aimed at giving them a life of prosperity and dignity,” he said.With the launch of initiatives, including soil health cards, the government wanted to bring a paradigm shift in the agriculture sector, he said.Taking a swipe at the DMK-Congress combine in Tamil Nadu, Modi said their “meetings are like corruption hackathons” where “their leaders sit and discuss on how to loot.”The NDA’s governance was one with compassion while the opposition’s was “misgovernance with corruption,” he alleged. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-underlines-support-for-farmers-says-nda-aims-to-ensure-their-dignity-217412
25-02-2021||Hyderabad||RSS chief advocates ‘Akhand Bharat’, says Pakistan in distress ever since partitioned from India||Advocating the need for ‘Akhand Bharat’ (undivided India), RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday said countries such as Pakistan which broke away from India are now in distress.Speaking at a book launch here, Bhagwat said ‘Akhand Bharat’ is possible through “Hindu Dharm”, but not by force.“There is a need to make glorious Akhand Bharat for the welfare of the universe. That’s why there is a need to awaken patriotism for the country,” Bhagwat said.More than the present India, the separated parts of erstwhile India, which shed their relevance with the country, have more necessity for the reunification to come out of their “miseries”, he further said.Stressing that the concept of ‘Akhand Bharat’ is possible, Bhagwat said some people had expressed serious doubts before the partition of the country in 1947 whether Pakistan would be formed, but it happened.India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, when asked before partition of the country in 1947, had said the possibility of formation of Pakistan was “dream of fools” though it happened.According to Bhagwat, Lord Wavell (during British rule) also said in British Parliament that God has made India one and so who would divide it.“But ultimately it (partition of India) happened.What seemed to be impossible had happened, so it cannot be ruled out that ‘Akhand Bharat’ which may seem to be impossible, will not happen,” he said.Alleging that there is unhappiness in the separated regions of ‘Akhand Bharat’ which now do not call themselves as ‘Bharat’, the RSS chief said the remedy to come out their miseries is reunification with India.“They (separated countries) did all they could, but did not find any remedy. And remedy is reunification (with Bharat) only and all their problems will get resolved,” he said.He, however, said the reunification should be done through “humanitys dharm” which according to him is called “Hindu dharm”.“Gandhar became Afghanistan. Is there peace and tranquility in Afghanistan since then? Pakistan was formed.From that date till now, is there peace and tranquility?” he asked.He said India has the endurance to overcome several challenges and the world looks towards it to overcome difficulties.With “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (world is one family) belief, India can again offer happiness and peace to the world, he added.

25-02-2021||London||From flashy diamantaire to fugitive: Nirav Modi’s long road to extradition||Nirav Modi’s story up until the UK court verdict on Thursday, just two days before his 50th birthday, is one of stark contrasts. From someone flush with diamonds, quite literally, as a member of a Gujarati family of gem traders who grew up in the European jewellery hub of Antwerp in Belgium, to ending up holed up in a jail cell in one Europe’s most overcrowded prisons.The diamond merchant wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated $ 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, lost his legal battle against extradition as a UK judge ruled that he does have a case to answer before the Indian courts.He has been lodged at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest on an extradition warrant in March 2019 at a central London bank branch, where he was trying to set up a new account.He had been staying nearby at a plush penthouse in Centrepoint in the heart of the UK capital, regularly walking his dog to an apparently new jewellery business nearby.It later emerged during the remand hearings at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London that he had hired Boutique Law LLP in anticipation of the extradition proceedings on charges of fraud and money laundering by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED), trying to strike a voluntary surrender and bail deal.However, as the CBI and the ED evidence was presented in the court by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, his offer of up to GBP 4 million as security to be allowed to be bailed under strict house arrest conditions was repeatedly rejected.His detention in a shared cell with one other inmate is a far cry from his past billionaire lifestyle, which involved hobnobbing with high-profile celebrities and his diamond designs finding red carpet favour with stars.“I was totally impressed with the craftsmanship at the workshop [in India]. It was the best quality I could see anywhere in the world,” Thierry Fritsch, a high-end French jewellery expert, told the UK court during the course of the extradition hearing last year.As someone who had served on the Advisory Board of Nirav Modi’s company for three years since 2015, Fritsch was deposed by the defence team to vouch for Nirav’s “integrity” and skills as an entrepreneur and creative person, who was passionate about establishing the first international brand of luxury jewellery out of India.A gems expert, Dr Richard Taylor, was also fielded to go into the nitty-gritty of the diamond trade and how the Nirav Modi brand had succeeded in making a mark around the world.“The industry relies on sending out high-value product to companies and to do that they require trust and confidence,” said Taylor, in an attempt to establish Modi’s credibility in the business.“India is the largest and most important centre of diamond cutting… it was a very significant trend that he [Modi] was part of,” he added.The picture painted in court was one of a talented jewellery designer who was only driven by one mission — to make the Nirav Modi brand worthy of competition with the likes of global luxury jewellery brands such as Tiffany or Cartier. And, the accusations associated with the extradition case were painted as nothing more than a commercial dispute.The CPS, in turn, presented documents and video evidence in an effort to establish a complex web of misuse of a bank credit facility called letters of undertaking (LoUs) and threats issued to so-called “dummy directors” of front companies to keep them out of the reach of Indian investigative authorities.Throughout the extradition case in London, Nirav Modi’s depression and mental health condition remained at the heart of arguments — with his extended incarceration said to have worsened his condition.“Coupled with a severe condition of depression, in my view, he presents a high risk of suicide albeit not immediately,” Dr Andrew Forrester, a forensic psychiatrist who examined him, told the court in September last year.At the time, Forrester said Nirav’s mental health condition was on a deterioration trajectory and met the criteria for hospital treatment in the absence of a multi-professional plan, involving antidepressants and psychotherapy.Except for a few initial remand hearings in 2019, Nirav has been appearing only via video link from a room in Wandsworth Prison as the case was conducted in a part-remote setting due to the coronavirus lockdown.During the hearings last year, he seemed alert and constantly referred to files related to the case made available to him. More recently, he has appeared via video link sporting a thick beard and at times more dishevelled than his appearance in a formal shirt and suit over the past year.

We will not tolerate this act of kidnapping of Hindu girls,” Rupani said.“Women are being lured and converted. This new law is aimed at stopping such activities,” he said.He was campaigning for February 28 elections to municipalities, taluka and district panchayats in the state.Rupani had announced on February 15 for the first time that the BJP government in the state will bring in such a law.BJP MLA Shailesh Mehta and the party’s Vadodara MP Ranjanben Bhatt had earlier called for a law on the lines of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-stop-conversion-of-hindu-girls-with-a-strict-law-gujarat-cm-217391
25-02-2021||Bengaluru||ISRO gears up to launch its new-generation mini rocket on maiden flight||The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is getting ready to launch a new- generation compact rocket on its maiden orbital test flight, the space agency said.Bengaluru-headquartered ISRO has over the years realised five generation of launch vehicles—SLV-3, ASLV, PSLV, GSLV and GSLV-MkIII.It had taken up development of the mini rocket—Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV)—to cater to the emerging global small satellite launch service market.Multiple sources in ISRO said on Thursday SSLV-D1 is targeted to be launched towards the end of March or early April—most likely in the first month of the financial year—though no firm date has been set so far.“We are flying an earth observation satellite (EOS-02) on board the first development flight of SSLV”, ISRO Chairman and Secretary in the Department of Space, K Sivan told PTI.SSLV has been designed to meet “launch on demand” requirements in a cost-effective manner for small satellites in a dedicated and rideshare mode.It is a three-stage all solid vehicle with a capability to launch up to 500 kg satellite mass into 500 km low earth orbit (LEO) and 300 kg to Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO).By comparison, PSLV—the workhorse of ISRO—can take up to 1,750 kg payload into SSO of 600 km altitude, according to ISRO officials.With lower per kg launch cost, the mini launcher will have multiple satellite mounting options for nano, micro and small satellites.Sivan had earlier termed the SSLV an innovative vehicle which can be assembled in just 72 hours.“Instead of 60 days (for building a PSLV), it (SSLV) will be assembled in three days; instead of 600 people (needed to build a PSLV), it (SSLV) will be done by six people”, he had said.Chairman and Managing Director of ISRO’s commercial arm, NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), G Narayanan said: “world over there is a big boom for small launch vehicles and that’s why we are focusing on that”.“As soon as SSLV-D1flight is over successfully, further roadmap (for SSLV) will be charted out”, Narayanan told PTI.In fact, Seattle, US-based satellite rideshare and mission management provider, Spaceflight Inc., has already purchased the first commercial launch of the SSLV (SSLV-D2) from NSIL for launch from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota.Spaceflight had said at the time that it has already sold-out the entire manifest (launch) for this secured SSLV-D2 launch, with spacecraft from an undisclosed US-based satellite constellation customer.This undisclosed customer is reportedly Seattle-based BlackSky Global which will launch four earth observation satellites on board SSLV-D2 in the rideshare mission arranged Spaceflight.“We’re taking advantage of the growth in the small satellite market to deliver more launch options with the mini-launcher”, a senior NSIL official said.“The SSLV is the much-needed solution to fill the gap in the portfolio of small launch vehicles,” CEO and President of Spaceflight, Curt Blake, had said.“SSLV is designed for the launch-on-demand concept with very quick turn-around capability in between launches. SSLV is perfectly suited for launching multiple microsatellites at a time and supports multiple orbital drop-offs”, Blake had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isro-gears-up-to-launch-its-new-generation-mini-rocket-on-maiden-flight-217388
25-02-2021||New Delhi||Another plea in HC for recognition of same-sex marriages||Four more people belonging to the gay and lesbian community urged the Delhi High Court on Thursday to declare that marriages between any two persons irrespective of their sex be solemnised under the Special Marriage Act (SMA).The Delhi government in response to a similar petition filed earlier has said that there is no provision in the SMA under which two women can be married, and it would be willing to abide by the court’s direction.The latest petition is in addition to three pleas already before the high court seeking recognition of same-sex marriages under the SMA, Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) and Foreign Marriage Act (FMA).A bench of Justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Amit Bansal sought response of the Centre on the joint plea by three men and a woman, who have urged the court to also declare that the SMA applies, regardless of sex, to any two persons who wish to marry by reading down any gender or sexuality-based restrictions contained in the Act.In their plea, filed through advocates Meghna Mishra and Tahira from Karanjawala and Co law firm, the petitioners have also sought that the provisions in the SMA which require a ‘male’ and a ‘female’ for solemnisation of marriage be declared as unconstitutional unless they are read as “neutral to gender identity and sexual orientation”.During the hearing, the central government assured the bench that it would file a reply to the earlier petitions during the day and the court listed all the four petitions, including the latest one, on April 20.Meanwhile, the Delhi government has filed its response to one of the petitions moved by two women seeking to get married under the SMA and challenging provisions of the statute to the extent it does not provide for same-sex marriages.It has said that there was no provision in the SMA under which the two women can be married and their marriage is registered.The Delhi government also said that it was “ready and willing to abide by the directions” of the court.The latest petition has said that three of the petitioners have gone abroad as Indian laws do not recognize same-sex couples or marriages and such relationships do not enjoy the same benefits as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples.The fourth petitioner is also contemplating going abroad to be with his partner as laws here do not recognize same-sex relationships, the petition has said.In the first petition on the issue before the high court, Abhijit Iyer Mitra and three others have contended that marriages between same-sex couples are not possible despite the Supreme Court decriminalising consensual homosexual acts and sought a declaration to recognise same-sex marriages under the HMA and SMA.The two other pleas are—one filed by two women seeking to get married under the SMA and challenging provisions of the statute to the extent it does not provide for same-sex marriages, and the other by two men who got married in the US but were denied registration of their marriage under the Foreign Marriage Act (FMA).              The two women and the two men, who got married abroad, have been represented by senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy and advocates Arundhati Katju, Govind Manoharan and Surabhi Dhar.The plea by equal rights activists Mitra, Gopi Shankar M, Giti Thadani and G Oorvasi was filed through advocates Raghav Awasthi with Mukesh Sharma.Mitra and others, in their petition, have contended that homosexuality has been decriminalised by the apex court but same-sex marriages are still not being allowed under the HMA provisions.“This is despite the fact that the said Act does not distinguish between heterosexual and homosexual marriage if one were to go by how it has been worded. It very clearly states that marriage can indeed be solemnised between any two Hindus.”“In this view of the matter, it can be stated that it is against the constitutional mandate of non-arbitrariness if the said right is not extended to homosexual apart from heterosexual couples,” the petition has said.The denial of this right to homosexual couples is also against the mandate of various international conventions that India is a signatory to, the plea said.The Centre had earlier told the high court that marriage between same-sex couples was “not permissible” as it was not recognised by “our laws, legal system, society and our values”.The petition by Mitra has said the case for extending the same right of marriage to ‘lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)’ persons as those enjoyed by everyone else is neither radical nor complicated and rests on two fundamental principles that underpin International Human Rights Law—equality and non-discrimination.The two women petitioners, aged 47 and 36, have contended that not being allowed to get married has denied them several rights—like owning a house, opening a bank account, family life insurance—which opposite-sex couples take for granted.The two men, who got married in the US, have said that their marriage was not registered under the FMA by the Indian consulate as they were the same-sex couple.      “The Indian consulate would have registered the marriage of any similarly placed opposite-sex couple,” they have contended.The couple, in a relationship since 2012 and got married in 2017, have also claimed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, non-recognition of their marriage by the laws here continues to disentitle them to travel as a married couple to India and spend time with their families. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/another-plea-in-hc-for-recognition-of-same-sex-marriages-217383

25-02-2021||Puducherry||Modi targets Rahul over his ‘north-south’ remarks, lashes out at Narayanasamy||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday attacked the Congress and its erstwhile government in Puducherry, saying the V Narayanasamy led dispensation had ‘different priorities’ than public welfare and flayed party leader Rahul Gandhi over his recent ‘north-south’ remarks.Hitting out at the “Congress culture” at a public meeting in the poll-bound union territory, he said people were witness to it in the last five years.“Our colonial rulers had the policy of divide and rule. Congress has a policy of divide, lie and rule. Sometimes their leaders put region against region... community against community,” he said in an apparent reference to Gandhi’s recent ‘north-south’ remarks which the BJP opposed strongly.During his Kerala visit on Tuesday, Gandhi had said he was used to a “different type of politics” in north India and coming to the southern state was “very refreshing” as people are interested in “issues”.Modi also expressed ‘shock’ over Gandhi’s statement that there was no ‘dedicated’ fisheries ministry at the Centre, adding the NDA government had set it up in 2019 and that its budgetary allocation has substantially gone up ever since.Averring that the people of Puducherry did not deserve a “high command” government that would serve a few Congress leaders, Modi assured that the NDA government, if voted in the coming elections, would treat people as its high command.Modi inaugurated a slew of completed projects here and laid the foundation stone for others, including in the ports and highways sectors.The Prime Minister inaugurated a Blood Centre at state-run JIPMER, a Sports Authority of India (SAI) girls hostel at Lawspet and a reconstructed Heritage Mairie Building.Modi laid the foundation stone for the four-laning of Sattanathapuram-Nagapattinam National Highway section, Medical College Building at Karaikal New Campus of JIPMER-Phase I and the development of Minor Port at Puducherry under Sagarmala scheme.He also laid the foundation stone of Synthetic Athletic Track, Indira Gandhi Sports Complex in the Union Territory.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-targets-rahul-over-his-north-south-remarks-lashes-out-at-narayanasamy-217370

25-02-2021||Kolkata||Mamata rides pillion on electric scooter to protest fuel price hike||In a unique protest against fuel price hike, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday rode pillion on an electric scooter to state secretariat Nabanna.Banerjee was seen sitting behind state minister Firhad Hakim, who rode the battery-powered electric scooter.With a placard protesting against the petrol price hike hanging around her neck, helmet-clad Banerjee waved at people on both sides of the road during the seven-km-long journey from Hazra More to the state secretariat.After reaching Nabanna following a 45-minute ride, Banerjee slammed the BJP-led government at the Centre saying, "We are protesting against the fuel price hike. The Modi government only makes false promises. They have done nothing to bring down fuel prices. You can see the difference in petrol prices when the Modi government came to power and now." She said the TMC will launch a stir against fuel price rise from Friday."The BJP had promised free LPG connections to the people before coming to power and now they are hiking its price," Banerjee said."Modi and Shah are selling the country. They are selling the profit-making PSUs. This is an anti-people, anti- woman, anti-youth, anti-farmer government," she said.The feisty TMC chief also criticised the BJP government for renaming the Sardar Patel Stadium, popularly known as the Motera stadium, in Ahmedabad after Prime Minister Narendra Modi."The way they are changing the names of stadiums, who knows they might change the name of the country in the coming days," she quipped.Speaking on her unique protest, Banerjee said, "I rode on an e-scooter to protest the manner in which petrol, diesel and LPG prices are rising."A middle-class household needs two LPG cylinders a month which they can't afford now. Over 1 crore people in our state also depend on kerosene which they are not getting now," she said.Banerjee said she will return home in the evening on the e-scooter.The chief minister was trailed by security personnel on other two-wheelers as other vehicles followed her a little distance away.There was tight security along the Hazra-Exide-AJC Bose Road-Vidyasagar Setu route.The opposition parties, however, called her protest an "election stunt"."The CM is resorting to novel theatrics ahead of the elections, but the state government is not doing its bit to reduce fuel prices," BJP leader Jai Prakash Majumder said.Congress Legislature Party leader Abdul Mannan said, "This is nothing but an election stunt. Why is the state government not substantially withdrawing cess to blunt the effect of the fuel price hike to help the common man?" Left Front leader Sujan Chakraborty compared her fuel hike protest with her earlier riding pillion on a motorcycle ridden by former PCAPA leader Chhatradhar Mahato during the Lalgarh agitation."Banerjee had ridden pillion on Chhatradhar Mahato's motorcycle in the Jangalmahal region before coming to power in the state but later people of that region witnessed the TMC's intimidation and terror," he said.The TMC supremo had earlier several times ridden pillion on two-wheelers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-rides-pillion-on-electric-scooter-to-protest-fuel-price-hike-217347

Coupled with these imbalances in the equation, is the imbalance of expectation and subjugation," Justice Mohite Dere said.Social conditions of women also make them handover themselves to their spouses, she said."Thus, men, in such cases, consider themselves as primary partners and their wives, chattel," the judge said.She said it is unfortunate that such a "medieval notion" of a wife being the husband's property still exists, and the wife is expected to do what her husband wished her to do."Thus, the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that the deceased by refusing to make tea for the appellant offered grave and sudden provocation, is ludicrous, clearly untenable and unsustainable and as such deserves to be rejected," the HC said while dismissing the man's appeal against his conviction and sentence.The defence also raised questions on the testimony of the couple's daughter, saying it was recorded after a delay of some days and it could not be believed.But, the high court rejected the argument and said, "Her testimony inspires confidence and cannot be disbelieved.There is nothing in the cross-examination of this witness to disbelieve her presence in the house at the relevant time."She (the daughter) is a natural witness, who woke up on hearing the quarrel between her parents and witnessed the assault on her mother by her father, and saw her father clean the spot soon thereafter, the court added.

25-02-2021||Lucknow||After spending 20 years in jail, UP man found ‘wrongly convicted’||A 43-year-old man from Lalitpur, ‘wrongly convicted’ in a rape case, has finally been acquitted by the Allahabad High Court after spending 20 years in jail.The man has been lodged in the Agra jail for the past two decades after being convicted of rape under IPC and the SC/ST Act.During this period, his parents and two brothers died but he was not allowed even to attend their last rites.A Division Bench of the high court finally announced his acquittal on Wednesday.According to reports, a Dalit woman of Lalitpur district, in September 2000, had accused Vishnu Tiwari, then 23, of raping her.Police had booked Vishnu Tiwari under sections 376, 506 of IPC and section 3 (1) (xii), 3 (2) (v) of the SC/ST (Prevention) of Atrocities Act.The case was investigated by the then Narhat Circle Officer, Akhilesh Narayan Singh, who submitted his report against Vishnu.The accused was sentenced to life imprisonment by the sessions court. He was later shifted to Agra jail where he is currently lodged.Vishnu appealed against the sessions court’s judgment in the high court in 2005 but somehow the case remained ‘defective’ for 16 years and could not be heard.Later, the state legal service authority appointed advocate Shweta Singh Rana as his defence counsel.The Division Bench of the high court, comprising Justices Kaushal Jayendra Thaker and Gautam Chaudhary, on January 28, stated in its order: “In view of the facts and evidence on record, we are convinced that the accused had been convicted wrongly, hence, the trial court’s judgment and the impugned order has been reversed and the accused is acquitted. The accused-appellant, if not warranted in any other case, be set free forthwith.” Rana said, “Vishnu has been set free by the high court. The local administration has to complete the legal formalities before he walks free.”Vishnu’s nephew Satyendra told reporters, “My uncle’s wrong conviction has shattered our whole family, both financially and socially. I lost my father, uncle and grandparents who died due to shock and social stigma.“A major portion of our family land had to be sold to contest the case. As far as my uncle Vishnu is concerned, his entire life has been destroyed as he spent the best years of his life in jail and that too, for doing no wrong.”—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-spending-20-years-in-jail-up-man-found-wrongly-convicted-217340
25-02-2021||United Nations||Right of self-defence applies also to attacks by non-state actors, India tells UN meeting||Exercising self-defence is a nation's primary right when a situation demands "immediate and proportionate action" and applies also to attacks by non-state actors, India told a UN meeting, highlighting several proxy cross-border and state-supported terrorist attacks like the 26/11 Mumbai assault the country was subjected to from its neighbour.India's Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador K Nagaraj Naidu said at an Arria Formula meeting organised by Mexico that a 1974 UN General Assembly declaration requires that a member state should not allow territory under its control to be used for terrorism against another state.The Arria Formula meetings are informal meetings on ‘Upholding the collective security system of the UN Charter: the use of force in international law, non-state actors and legitimate self-defence'.The Security Council also mandates all states to refrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts, Naidu said on Wednesday.“Despite this, some states are resorting to proxy war by supporting non-state actors such as terrorist groups to evade international censure. Such support to non-state actors has ranged from providing and equipping the terrorist groups with training, financing, intelligence and weapons to logistics and recruitment facilitation,” he said.India for decades has been subject to such proxy cross-border and relentless state-supported terrorist attacks from our neighbourhood, he said."Whether it is was the 1993 Mumbai bombings, or the random and indiscriminate firings of 26/11 which witnessed the launch of the phenomenon of lone-wolves or more recently, the cowardly attacks in Pathankot and Pulwama, the world has been witness to the fact that India has repeatedly been targeted by such non-state actors with the active complicity of another host state,” Naidu said.Naidu told the meeting that exercising self-defence is a primary right of states to be exercised when the situation is imminent and “demands necessary, immediate, and proportionate action” and that customary international law has long recognised the principles governing the use of force in self-defence.

25-02-2021||Palghar||Kidnapping claim of Navy man who was ‘burnt alive’ seems to be fiction: Police||A Navy seaman from Jharkhand who died in Maharashtra's Palghar district after allegedly being set on fire by his kidnappers had apparently concocted the whole story of abduction, police said on Wednesday.Leading Seaman Surajkumar Mitilesh Dube (27), who was posted at a naval base at Coimbatore, was indebted heavily due to losses in the stock market and was depressed, police said.Probe is still underway to ascertain whether he had been really kidnapped and burnt alive or it was suicide, said Palghar Superintendent of Police Dattatreya Shinde at a press conference.Dube, who was found with burn injuries in Palghar district near Mumbai on the early morning of February 5, had told police before dying the same day that three men kidnapped him at gun point outside Chennai airport on  the night on January 30.They brought him to Palghar in an SUV and set him on fire when they realized they would not get money, he said.However, probe found holes in the story, SP Shinde said.Dube had incurred heavy losses in the stock market and had run up huge debts but he concealed this from his family, the SP said.He had been moving around freely in Chennai after January 30, had withdrawn money from ATM and even traveled to Vellore, police found.From CCTV footage, police also found that around 5.30 on the morning of February 5, Dube had bought two cans of diesel from a petrol pump in Talasari in Palghar.All this gave rise to suspicion that he set himself on fire in a suicide bid, the SP said, adding that the police had not reached any definitive conclusions yet.Dube had got engaged on January 15 and he was to get married on May 22, police said.

25-02-2021||Dhaka||India searching for Rohingya adrift without food, water: UN||The UN refugee agency said the Indian coast guard had answered its plea to look for a boat carrying Rohingya refugees believed to be adrift in the Andaman Sea without food and water for several days.The boat was believed to have left Bangladesh two weeks ago and then broken down at sea, with the UN and rights groups reporting many of the about 90 refugees on board now suffering acute dehydration. Their families are worried many may have already died.The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said on Wednesday it does not know the boat's exact current location. The agency on Monday had alerted nearby nations to look for the boat and said it was prepared to offer humanitarian assistance if it was found.The mother of a 25-year-old man on the boat said she was worried about his fate.“Oh God, save all of the people that are stuck in the boat, including my son, with your divine magic. Put them somewhere on the coast of the river. Please fulfil the wishes of my son to go there,” said Nasima Khatun.“Is my son alive? Has anything happened to him because of hunger? I do not know anything about what my son is doing, how he is surviving. He only took four litres of water,” she said.Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project that monitors the Rohingya crisis, said they had heard at least eight people had died on the boat.Lewa said they boarded the boat on February 11 to reach Southeast Asia but its engine broke down.She said the Arakan Project had been unable to contact the refugees for several days.“We had talked to them. But now they are traceless. They have no water or food, they are drinking sea water and dying,” Lewa said by phone.The UN refugee agency appreciated the Indian coast guard’s deployment of their search and rescue team, said Catherine Stubberfield, spokesperson for the UNHCR Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific.“Given that the refugees are still adrift at sea, immediate disembarkation is absolutely critical to meeting their most basic human needs and ensuring that their safety is no longer threatened,” she said in an email.PN Anup, a spokesman for the Indian coast guard, said he had “nothing to say as of now”.Authorities in Bangladesh said they had no information about any boat that recently carried Rohingya out of Bangladesh’s waters.

25-02-2021||Washington||Biden revokes Trump ban on many green card applicants||US President Joe Biden on Wednesday revoked a proclamation from his predecessor that blocked many green card applicants from entering the United States.Former President Donald Trump issued the ban last year, saying it was needed to protect U.S. workers amid high unemployment due to the coronavirus pandemic.Biden rejected that reasoning in a proclamation on Wednesday rescinding the visa ban. The Democratic president said it had prevented families from reuniting in the United States and harmed U.S. businesses.Biden, a Democrat, has pledged to reverse many of Trump's hardline immigration policies. Immigrant advocates had pressed in recent weeks for him to lift the visa ban, which was set to expire on March 31.Biden left in place another ban on most foreign temporary workers.In October, a federal judge in California blocked Trump's ban on those foreign guest workers as it affected hundreds of thousands of U.S. businesses that fought the policy in court.Curtis Morrison, a California-based immigration attorney, who represents people subject to the ban said Biden will now have to tackle a growing backlog of applications that have been held up for months as the pandemic shut down most visa processing by the State Department. The process could potentially take years, he said."It's a backlog that Trump created," Morrison said. "He broke the immigration system."The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biden-revokes-trump-ban-on-many-green-card-applicants-217327

Narendra Modi is the biggest ‘dangabaaz’ (rioter), the biggest ‘dhandabaaz’ (opportunist). You are selling the entire country for crores, what is that for? Cat money or rat money,” Banerjee said, referring to the BJP’s repeated allegations of “cut money” (commission) against the Trinamool Congress. The TMC boss exuded confidence that her party will come back to power after the Assembly elections.“It will be game on (‘khela hobe’) in the Assembly polls... I will be the goalkeeper and you (BJP) will not be able to score a single goal. All shots will fly above the goal post,” Banerjee said, invoking the Bengali sentiment for football, the state’s most popular sport. Attacking the BJP, Banerjee said nothing could be gained from violence that is practised by the party.“He (Modi) had gone to win the elections for Donald Trump. Everyone knows what happened with him. Modi will meet an even worse fate,” she said.

I will submit that they (Delhi assembly) are wrong on both,” the senior lawyer said.During the proceedings held through video-conferencing, Salve said these kind of “expansion of power through backdoor” should not be allowed and “in the noisy times of the present, right to silence is a virtue. And leave it to me to decide, whether or not I want to go”.

25-02-2021||Chandigarh||Waste heat for powering home appliances, automobiles||Indian scientists have found a new lead-free material which can efficiently convert waste heat to power small home appliances and automobiles.So far, most of the efficient thermoelectric materials developed by scientists use lead as a major constituent element, thereby restricting their use for mass-market applications.Scientists from the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research have identified a lead-free material called Cadmium doped Silver Antimony Telluride which can efficiently allow recovery of electricity from “waste heat”, marking a paradigm shift in the thermoelectric puzzle, the Ministry of Science and Technology announced today.Thermoelectric energy conversion allows generation of electrical voltage when one end of a material is heated while keeping the other side cold.Finding an efficient material to realise this scientific principle has been a daunting task for scientists. It entails fitting in three seemingly different properties — high electrical conductivity of metals, high thermoelectric sensitivity of semiconductors and low thermal conductivity of glasses — into a single material.The team used an advanced electron microscopy technique to visualise the resultant ordering of atoms in nanometer scale.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/waste-heat-for-powering-home-appliances-automobiles-217148

India is also looking at giving substance to a trilateral with Russia and Japan for forays in the Russian Far East and the Northern Sea Route in the Arctic, again with the implicit purpose of reducing China’s salience. Ironically, the first trilateral India has been involved in has China as its member besides Russia.A French read-out of the trilateral of Secretaries was explicit about the purpose — to underscore the goal of guaranteeing peace, security and adherence to international law in the Indo-Pacific by drawing on the excellence of bilateral relations between France, India and Australia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-plans-joint-forays-into-indo-pacific-with-france-oz-217088

She also made noteworthy efforts to empower our Nari Shakti.”The message comes as the politically dramatic state gears up for the Assembly elections, the first in the absence of two political giants — Jayalalithaa and late DMK supremo M Karunanidhi.The BJP has an alliance with the AIADMK in the state. The PM will be visiting the state tomorrow to inaugurate and lay the foundation stone of various development initiatives.While the AIADMK has said Sasikala won’t be taken back, the BJP appears divided over “Chinnamma”. According to some BJP leaders, if the NDA wants to defeat rival DMK, then Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dinakaran should be brought on board.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-tn-poll-sasikala-signals-truce-with-aiadmk-217102

Indians are not superficial, you are Mr Rahul,” Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said today.Gandhi had at a Thiruvananthapuram rally yesterday said, “For the first 15 years I was an MP in the north and I had got used to a different kind of politics. Coming to Kerala was refreshing for me as I suddenly realised people are interested in issues at a deeper level and not just superficially.”The Congress defended Gandhi today with party media chief Randeep Surjewala saying the North-South divide is a “toolkit” being adopted and sold by the BJP to the news channels and to the public.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-cong-trade-barbs-over-rahuls-north-south-remark-217115
25-02-2021||New Delhi||Mistrust hits pullback, troops not yet back at home bases||Even as there has been visible disengagement of Indian and Chinese troops along a section of the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh, the de-escalation and deinduction — which means pulling back troops and war equipment to the pre-April 2020 home bases — have not yet begun in the area.At the commander-level meet on Saturday, the two sides did discuss phased de-escalation and deinduction, but there has been no forward movement on the two issues, sources told The Tribune, adding that “it could take more talks as a lack of trust exists for now”.Catering for redeploymentThe two sides don’t want to pull back to locations from where redeployment, in case of an exigency, could take time, say sources.The first phase of the disengagement process commenced on February 10 with simultaneous withdrawal by both sides from both banks of the Pangong Tso, a 135-km-wide glacial lake. The matters of disengagement at Depsang, Gogra or Hot Springs are likely to come up in subsequent talks.Army Chief Gen MM Naravane, speaking at an event of a think tank in New Delhi on Wednesday, sounded a word of caution: “We still have a long way to go. We now have to go on to the stage of de-escalation, then deinduction of troops. We have to be wary and cautious.”A senior functionary explained that it was a clear case of lack of trust, hence the two militaries didn’t want to pull back to locations from where redeployment, in case of an exigency, could take time.The present positions of troops, tanks or guns are not face to face but they are within striking range of artillery fire and from where rapid redeployment is possible.General Naravane too spoke about the lack of trust, saying that “there is trust deficit with China and we will be watching Chinese moves closely”.Some of mistrust stems from statements of the Chinese Ministry of Defence as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing, which tried to wrongly blame India for the Galwan clash on June 15 last year. The statements had come on February 19, indicating that China was under pressure from its domestic audience, which has no access to international media or opinion.China is in the habit of creeping and making very small incremental changes along the LAC where each change by itself doesn’t appear to be very big or worthy of a strong reaction, said the Army Chief.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mistrust-hits-pullback-troops-not-yet-back-at-home-bases-217032

The Health Ministry will soon clarify which comorbidities will be covered for those aged 45 and above. If vaccines are taken at the 20,000 private facilities, people will have to pay.”The Health Ministry is working out the vaccine cost and will announce it soon, said the government, which had borne the cost of vaccination for health and frontline workers covered in the first phase. India has so far administered 1,23,66,633 doses with an overall coverage of eligible beneficiaries hovering at 60 per cent.The government further clarified that the efficacy of Indian vaccines Covaxin and Covishield had been firmly established worldwide and several countries had received these vaccines.The government is aiming to speed up vaccinations to ensure early herd immunity and minimise any adverse impact of a second wave with infections rising in some states.The Centre has sent teams to 10 states, including Punjab, Maharashtra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, MP and J&K, to detect the reason behind the surge and guide local governments in containment.Punjab, Maharashtra, Haryana and J&K are among the states that reported an increase in active cases over yesterday while Kerala reported a drop. The Centre has also written to high-burden states to escalate inoculation in districts reporting a rise in cases and the positivity rate.Punjab’s SBS Nagar, Kapurthala and Muktsar as well as J&K’s Pulwama are among districts of worry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/phase-2-free-jab-for-60-in-govt-centres-217033

25-02-2021||Barabanki (UP)||‘Caged parrot’ Rajnath Singh could resolve impasse if allowed to talk to farmers: Naresh Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union president Naresh Tikait on Wednesday called Defence Minister Rajnath Singh a “caged parrot” and said the farmers’ issues could be resolved if he is given the freedom to talk with them.He accused the BJP-led central government of being “stubborn” over the three new laws, which farmer unions want repealed. The protesting farmers too are not ready to go back on their demands, he said.“The government has made Defence Minister Rajnath Singh a caged parrot (‘pinjre ka tota’). If he is given the freedom to talk to farmers, I can guarantee that there would be a decision and the BJP’s prestige will also remain intact,” he said.He said farmers respect the Defence Minister, but he is not given a chance by the government to deal with the farmers’ issue.Tikait addressed a farmers’ “mahapanchyat” here and also spoke to reporters, claiming that the Centre was not paying heed to the farmers protesting against the laws.“The government is stubborn and is not ready to hear out farmers. It should change its attitude,” the BKU leader said.“If the PM is not ready to repeal the laws, we are also not going to backtrack. The farmers are ruined and not getting the right price for their produce. The rise in prices of power, petrol and diesel has affected them also,” he said.“If this government continues for long, farmers will have to abandon agriculture,” added.The BKU leader said the way to Uttar Pradesh’s Purvanchal is through Barabanki and if farmers here are made aware of the impact of the new laws, they will be able to tell farmers in that region about it.“This government is defaming farmers, labelling them as terrorists and Khalistanis and we will not remain silent on this,” he said.Tikait indicated that he had no quarrel with Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan, whose supporters and those of the Rashtriya Lok Dal clashed recently over the farmers’ protests.He indirectly referred to the riots in western Uttar Pradesh in 2013, over which Balyan too had faced charges.“Earlier Hindus and Muslims lived in amity. But from 2013, BJP spread misconceptions among them and divided society. But now people have understood their tricks,” the BKU leader said.Thousands of farmers have been camping at the border of Delhi since November-end, demanding the repeal of the new agri-marketing laws. They claim that the laws will weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system, an argument that the government rejects.

With the half front, he was referring to the internal security.He said right from the beginning of the standoff, all sides on the Indian side worked together.Be it at the political level, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar spoke to their Chinese counterparts, he said.“We were all in it together. We had our plan chalked out which we had discussed on what should be the way forward. Whatever has panned out, has happened as a result of that. What we have achieved so far is very good,” Naravane said at a webinar organised by Vivekanada International Foundation.The advice which was given by National Security Adviser also came in extremely handy and his insight into strategic level affairs definitely helped us chalking out the response, the Army chief said.“As a result of this whole approach, this disengagement has taken place. I think it is a very good end result. It is a win-win situation. For any agreement to last, both sides should feel that they have achieved something. I think a good outcome that has resulted out of the 10 rounds of talks which have taken place so far,” he said.Last week, armies of the two countries concluded withdrawal of troops and weapons from north and south banks of Pangong Tso in the high-altitude region. Naravane said there are some issues which remain in the area of Depsang, in the area of eastern Ladakh and in other areas along northern border.“...But we have our strategies in place for that. Do we have anything to negotiate in future? Yes, definitely we have. But I would not, of course, for obvious reasons, what those strategies would be to further and progress our negotiations and come out with a favourable outcome.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disengagement-win-win-situation-for-both-sides-army-chief-216975
25-02-2021||London||PNB scam case: UK judge to rule on Nirav Modi extradition case on Thursday||Wanted diamond merchant Nirav Modi, who remains behind bars in a London prison as he contests his extradition to India on charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, will find out the UK court’s ruling in the nearly two-year-long legal battle on Thursday.The 49-year-old is expected to appear via videolink from Wandsworth Prison in south-west London at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, where District Judge Samuel Goozee is set to hand down his judgment on whether the jeweller has a case to answer before the Indian courts.The magistrates’ court ruling will then be sent back to UK Home Secretary Priti Patel for a sign-off, with the possibility of appeals in the High Court on either side depending on the outcome.Modi was arrested on an extradition warrant on March 19, 2019, and has appeared via videolink from Wandsworth Prison for a series of court hearings in the extradition case.His multiple attempts at seeking bail have been repeatedly turned down, both at the Magistrates’ and High Court level, as he was deemed a flight risk.He is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of letters of undertaking (LoUs) or loan agreements, and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.He also faces two additional charges of “causing the disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death”, which were added on to the CBI case.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian government, has sought to establish a prima facie case against him and also to establish that there are no human rights issues blocking his extradition to India. CPS barrister Helen Malcolm has argued that the jeweller presided over a “ponzi-like scheme where new LoUs were used to repay old ones”.A ponzi scheme typically refers to an investment scam which generates funds for earlier investors with money taken from later investors and the CPS has claimed that Modi used his firms – Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds – to make fraudulent use of PNB’s LoUs in a conspiracy with banking officials.They have also played videos in court as proof of Modi’s involvement in intimidating dummy officers of his companies to remain out of the reach of Indian investigating authorities.Modi’s defence team, led by barrister Clare Montgomery, has claimed that the entire issue is a commercial dispute involving “authorised though ill-advised lending” that took place in “broad daylight”. It is also claimed that none of his actions meet the legal threshold of perverting the course of justice or amounted to fraud.Besides, the defence has also relied on arguments around Modi’s precarious mental health condition, as someone who has a family history of depression and suicide.During a series of hearings in the course of the extradition case last year and early this year, Westminster Magistrates Court has also heard detailed arguments from both sides about why Modi’s “deteriorating” mental health condition does or does not meet the Section 91 threshold of the Extradition Act 2003 – which was most recently been used in the UK to block the extradition of Wikileaks Founder Julian Assange on the grounds of it being “unjust and oppressive” as he is a high suicide risk.The CPS has challenged the defence stance and had called for an independent evaluation of medical records by a consultant psychiatrist for appropriate assurances to be acquired by the authorities in terms of his care in India.Prison conditions at Barrack 12 in Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai, where Modi is to be held, have also been in focus as the Indian government submitted an updated video recording of the cell to highlight that it meets all human rights requirements of natural light and ventilation.Modi’s legal battle marks one of a number of high-profile extradition cases involving accused Indian economic offenders in the UK. While former Kingfisher Airlines boss Vijay Mallya remains on bail as a “confidential” matter related to his extradition to India is resolved, accused arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari’s extradition case is scheduled for its next hearing in April.In February 2020, wanted cricket bookie Sanjeev Chawla was extradited to face charges in India and became the first extradition of its kind under the India-UK Extradition Treaty, signed in 1992.A previous extradition of Samirbhai Vinubhai Patel, wanted in connection with the Godhra riots in Gujarat, from the UK to India in October 2016 had been uncontested and therefore did not have to go through various levels of appeals in the UK courts. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pnb-scam-case-uk-judge-to-rule-on-nirav-modi-extradition-case-on-thursday-216969
