26-02-2021||New Delhi/ Mumbai||Domestic air traffic may be back to full pre-COVID-19 level by summer: Puri||The domestic air traffic is expected to be back to the full pre-COVID-19 level by the summer schedule with the traffic seeing a sharp recovery from the July quarter onwards after the resumption of the services post Unlock 1.0, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri said on Friday.Speaking at the ‘India Aircraft Leasing Summit’ at New Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan, Puri also said the government is not averse to tweaking the system to make India a centre for aircraft leasing for both domestic and international markets.“Contrary to prophets of doom and gloom, we have not only been able to navigate the pandemic turbulence, (but) today in terms of domestic civil aviation, we are almost at the pre-COVID-19 level.“If a mutation or variant of the virus comes in, by the time we open our summer schedule by April we will have our full pre-COVID-19 level of domestic traffic or even higher,” said Puri.Stating that civil aviation is the critical driver of economic growth, he said that between 2013-14 and 2019-20, the country’s domestic traffic growth has been 14 per cent.“The best year we had with just 7 per cent penetration, we had a growth rate of 17 per cent. But, on average, it comes at 14 per cent,” he said.The minister said that barring the first quarter of 2020 (April-June), there has been a sharp recovery in passenger traffic from July onwards.Commensurate with the growth potential of the Indian aviation sector in the next 20 years, India will need something like 1,700 to 2,100 aircraft, valued roughly at USD 290 billion with an estimated delivery of 100 aircraft each year or about USD 5 billion of financing each year, he said.“We are looking at operating 2,000 aircraft in domestic and international (going ahead),” Puri said.The paradigmatic shift that is happening in the Indian aviation today is on account of a large number of factors. But, the two developments that resonated in the last 2-3 Budgets, those related to establishment of MROs and financial services particularly aircraft leasing, are going to provide the transformative change, said the minister.“We are today the third-largest domestic civil aviation market and within a very short period of time, we will be the world’s third-largest civil aviation market in overall terms,” he said.Commercial aircraft are a mobile asset that can be rapidly redeployed to serve the strongest market. The share of these aircraft on lease has escalated from 2 per cent in 1980 to over 41 per cent in 2018, and it is estimated to have reached 50 per cent in 2020.“We are perhaps comparable (with other major aviation markets) in some respects. Maybe we have gone a little further, but we are not averse to learning and to tweaking the system further to attract,” he said while echoing the opinion of IFSCA Chairperson Injeti Srinivas that India needs to move from a consumer of aviation products to a producer.The aircraft leasing business in India also caters to the international market, he added.Once the Jewar International Airport becomes functional by 2024, the combined traffic of the Delhi airport will be around 140 million, which will be more than the combined traffic of London Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports, among others, the minister said.“We are developing hubs in India. Delhi and Jewar will be a big hub, Mumbai and Navi Mumbai will be a big hub. Bengaluru and Hyderabad will be hub in the South. So, once you are developing this type of scenario, you do not have to go to Europe or some other place,” he said.Puri added that the ecosystem that the government has put in place and with IFSC in Gujarat, India will be at par with other countries of the world to serve a sector that is a critical driver of economic growth. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/domestic-air-traffic-may-be-back-to-full-pre-covid-19-level-by-summer-puri-217847

26-02-2021||New Delhi||UN human rights chief for ‘meaningful’ Govt-farmer talks||UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet has highlighted the continued protests by hundreds of thousands of farmers and called for meaningful consultations with those concerned.Speaking at the 46th session of the Human Rights Council which was also addressed by Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, Bachelet said charges of sedition against journalists and activists for reporting or commenting on the protests, and attempts to curb freedom of expression on social media were “disturbing departures from essential human rights principles’’.A former two-time President of Chile she hoped the ongoing dialogue efforts between the government and the farmers will lead to an equitable solution to this crisis that respects the rights of all.,With regard to inclusion and participation, she was encouraged by the recent experience of a pilot programme in Kerala where civil society organisations and community leaders have used innovative technology to ensure that the voices of marginalised and poor people are heard, and their needs addressed, in the pandemic response.Bachelet was delivering the ‘Global Update’ speech to the 47-member-state Human Rights Council in Geneva. India was not the only country criticised; Bachelet spoke in varying degrees of detail about human rights issues in about 50 specific countries.The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said her office continued to monitor the situation in Kashmir, where restrictions on communications, and clampdowns on civil society activists, remain of concern.Despite the recent restoration of 4G access for mobile phones, the communications blockade has seriously hampered civic participation, as well as business and livelihoods.Raids against human rights defenders in October and November exemplify the continued restrictions on civil society, and resulting impact on the rights of the people of Kashmir.At the same time, she said Internet access in Pakistan-Administered Kashmir also remains a serious problem, prompting student protests in the past year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/un-human-rights-chief-for-meaningful-govt-farmer-talks-217841

Terminal-1 caters to domestic passengers and Terminal-2 has international services besides domestic operations of some of the Indian airlines. Prior to the pandemic, some airlines were carrying out their domestic operations from T1.However, after the resumption of domestic commercial passenger services in late last year, following a nearly two-month shutdown in the wake of the pandemic, the flight services were being operated only from T2.The CSMIA is re-opening its Terminal 1 for domestic flight operations with effect from March 10, a release said.From midnight, March 10, GoAir, Star Air, Air Asia and Trujet will resume all its domestic operations from Terminal 1, the airport operator said.In case of IndiGo, while most of its flight operations will be managed from Terminal 2, the base flights will operate through Terminal 1, it added.Since the advent of the nationwide lockdown in March 2020, operations at T1 were suspended temporarily and was consolidated through Terminal 2 for the convenience of the passengers and stakeholders, it said.Upholding the safety of the passengers, the resumption of services via T1 is a step further in ensuring that social distancing is strictly followed, it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-airport-to-resume-domestic-flight-operations-from-terminal-1-from-march-10-217839

We will ride two-wheelers, walk on foot because West Bengal is on the march towards change," Irani said.Enthused by the minister's spontaneity, scores of BJP workers followed Irani on two-wheelers, chanting "Jai Shri Ram" and "Khela Hobey", meaning 'game on'---a slogan first raised by the Trinamool Congress, which has now become the catchphrase of this election season.Irani, the minister of textile, led the rally on the scooter for a few kilometres, often stopping as fervent supporters gathered, choking the road.The minister interacted with the party's young supporters in fluent Bengali, besides reaching out to the people."I want to thank everybody. We are out today to take your blessings. You have already given an opportunity to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and during the elections in West Bengal, bless the BJP and the 'Lotus'," she said as a cordless mic was handed to her to speak.The minister got on to the rath again a few kilometres later till Bhojerhat, around 20 km away from where she started the journey.Irani's bike rally comes a day after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee took to the streets, riding an e-scooter to protest against the steep price rise of petrol and diesel. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-mamata-smriti-irani-takes-a-scooter-ride-as-race-for-bengal-heats-up-217838
26-02-2021||New Delhi||Balakot air strikes displayed forces’ capability to strike deep in adversary’s territory: Experts||The Balakot air strikes displayed the armed forces’ capability to retaliate deep in the adversary’s territory and also accelerated the process of acquisition of defence assets, experts said on Friday.India’s warplanes hit a Jaish-e-Mohammed camp in Balakot on February 26, 2019 to avenge the killing of 40 CRPF personnel in the Pulwama terror attack.Pakistan retaliated the next day but the IAF foiled their plans. The attack by India and subsequent retaliation by Pakistan triggered fears of a war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Air Marshal (retd) Anil Khosla, who was the Vice Chief of the Indian Air Force (IAF) during the Balakot strikes, said capacity building is a continuous process in the armed forces.“But incidents like Balakot fastened the process of capacity building,” he said.He added that assets like Rafale fighter jets, the Chinook heavy lift choppers and Apache multi-role combat helicopters were introduced in the IAF’s fleet post the Balakot strikes.“The integration of weapons systems with the aircraft was also fastened,” he said.The newly inducted Rafale, Chinooks and Apache are being deployed in eastern Ladakh where troops from both India and China remained heavily deployed after a border standoff between the Indian and Chinese armies erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong Lake area.Subsequently, 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a fierce hand-to-hand combat on June 15 in the Galwan Valley, an incident that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in over four decades. Eight months after the confrontation, China admitted that its four soldiers were killed in the fight.Lt. Gen. (retd) Satish Dua, who was the Corps Commander of the Srinagar based XV Corps when the Indian Army undertook surgical strikes post the Uri attack in 2016, said these two strikes show India’s capacity and resolve to carry out an action.“Before Uri happened, we were only defensive in our approach because they would send in terrorists and they would create violence. They would carry out the BAT (Border Action Team consisting of Pakistani special forces and terrorists) action and we would only be defensive. The Uri attack was the last straw. We did an action of going deep inside and Balakot was much deeper inside...so we have given them a clear signal that no longer we will only take defensive action.“That is the paradigm shift the country and the leadership has taken,” Dua said.Lt. Gen. (retd) D S Hooda, who was the Army’s Northern Commander during the surgical strikes post the Uri attack in 2016, said the Balakot strike displayed India’s response to terrorism.“It was a much stronger response. The ability to strike deep also gave greater to the armed forces in its military capability,” Hooda said.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the success of the Balakot air strikes displayed India’s strong will to act against terrorism.“On the anniversary of Balakot Air Strikes, I salute the exceptional courage and diligence of the Indian Air Force. The success of Balakot strikes has shown India’s strong will to act against terrorism. We are proud of our Armed Forces who keep India safe and secure,” Singh tweeted.Home Minister Amit Shah said with the Balakot strike, the IAF made clear the “New India’s” policy against terrorism by giving response to the Pulwama terror attack.“On this day in 2019, @IAF_MCC had made it clear the New India’s policy against terrorism by giving response to the Pulwama terror attack,” Shah tweeted.“I remember the brave martyrs of Pulwama and salute the valour of the Air Force. Under the leadership of @narendramodi ji, security of the country and our soldiers is paramount,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/balakot-air-strikes-displayed-forces-capability-to-strike-deep-in-adversarys-territory-experts-217837

If EC doesn’t provide justice to the people, where will the people go,” she said.Banerjee said that despite “all these tricks”, she will win the elections.“I have information from my sources that the poll dates are similar to the ones BJP wanted. Have the dates been announced as per the suggestions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah? The PM and the home minister cannot misuse their power for the state elections,” she added.Banerjee said she is the daughter of the state and knows Bengal better than the BJP, exuding confidence about her party Trinamool Congress winning the elections. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-questions-eight-phases-of-west-bengal-elections-217832
26-02-2021||New Delhi||Five Assemblies: BJP has little to lose but a whole lot to gain||Apart from Assam where it is running a government, the five Assembly elections announced by the Election Commission on Friday are those where the BJP has very little to lose but a whole lot to gain. In fact, in two out of the five election-bound assemblies in the South (Tamil Nadu and Puducherry) the BJP has “zero” number of seats. In Kerala, it has one seat—Nemom. Overall in the three southern states where it is hoping to make real big gains this time, it is defending just one seat that it holds in Kerala. Therefore, wins will all be gains, especially in Tamil Nadu, where its current ally, the AIADMK, is defending the government it had formed after sweeping the 2016-elections under late J Jayalaithaa. The five assemblies are going to polls at a critical time, amid Covid pandemic and resulting unemployment, the agitation against the three Central three farm laws and rising fuel prices. The results are bound to be read as a people’s verdict on these issues.      Currently, the major chunk of BJP’s sitting seats (as many as 60) are in Assam, which the saffron leadership is absolutely confident of retaining. It had won just three seats in West Bengal in 2016 (the rest were added later from defections), Therefore West Bengal is the real fortress to watch out for. A prestige issue for the BJP, especially Home Minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda, the leadership has made it their mission to wrest it from Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress. In both Kerala and West Bengal, the saffron party is engaged in bitter battle with two strong regional opponents. It is here that the saffron party is hoping to make a major dent armed with the double dose of Hindu-Muslim polarisation and a slew of infrastructure projects that Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, West Bengal and Assam, making development the centerpiece in the run-up to the elections.The BJP is confident of winning at least four out of the five assemblies. Recently, general secretary Bhupendra Yadav said the party will win “at least 200 seats in West Bengal and return to power in Assam, comfortably”. He said “the NDA will form the government in Puducherry and likewise in Tamil Nadu with the AIADMK”. Regarding Kerala, Yadav said the party will “increase its support base” and “emerge as the third pillar” in the deeply polarised political scenario of the southern state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/five-assemblies-bjp-has-little-to-lose-but-a-whole-lot-to-gain-217829

26-02-2021||Raipur||141 farmers committed suicide in Chhattisgarh in 10 months: Govt||As many as 141 farmers have committed suicide in Chhattisgarh in the last 10 months, the state government informed the legislative assembly on Friday.The issue of farmer suicides rocked the Assembly, with the opposition BJP demanding a probe into these cases and seeking compensation for the kin of deceased farmers.The issue was raised by Leader of Opposition Dharamlal Kaushik during the Question Hour, when he sought to know how many farmers had committed suicide between April 2020 and February 1, 2021 in the state and the reasons for these deaths.He also enquired about the action taken in these cases and compensation given to families of the deceased.In response, state Agriculture Minister Ravindra Choubey said 141 farmers had committed suicide during the period.In one such case in Kondagaon district, a lower-level revenue officer was suspended for allegedly making a mistake in crop girdawari and (land) record documentation, Choubey said.Hitting out at the government, Kaushik said an investigation should be conducted in all such cases of suicides and compensation should be given to kin of the deceased farmers after probe.To this, the minister said this was not a matter of politics, but unfortunately, the BJP was trying to politicise farmer suicides.Suicides had taken place earlier (during the BJP rule) as well, but did they consider giving compensation at the time, Choubey said.Congress MLAs then pointed out incidents of farmer suicides during the previous government’s rule and claimed that no compensation was given to the kin of deceased farmers.This led to a pandemonium in the House, and BJP MLAs staged a walkout from the Assembly, expressing dissatisfaction over the government’s reply. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/141-farmers-committed-suicide-in-chhattisgarh-in-10-months-govt-217811
26-02-2021||London||Indians rank high on positivity about finances in new Global Student Survey||As many as eight in 10 or 80 per cent Indian undergraduate students feel hopeful about their finances in the future, the second-highest of 21 countries surveyed for a new “Global Student Survey” released on Friday, with only China and Kenya jointly ahead at 84 per cent.The findings, published by Chegg.org – the non-profit arm of education technology company Chegg, also reveal that after the COVID-19 pandemic, 54 per cent of Indian students would like their university course to incorporate more online learning, the fourth highest of any other country surveyed – equal to Canada (54 per cent) and behind Saudi Arabia (78 per cent), China (77 per cent) and South Korea and Australia (both 57 per cent).The survey’s worldwide results show that Indian students agree with their peers across all 21 countries when it comes to how higher education should embrace online learning. Around two-thirds (65 per cent) of students across the surveyed countries say they would rather want their university offered the choice of more online learning if it meant paying lower tuition fees.“One thing that unites students around the globe is that they have experienced first-hand the greatest disruption to education the world has ever known. This survey shows the COVID pandemic has laid bare for students that the higher education model needs to be reimagined, shorter, on-demand, personalised and provide scalable support,” said Dan Rosensweig, President and CEO of Chegg.“Technology and online learning are a permanent part of modern education and should dramatically reduce the cost of learning and make it more skills based. When approximately two-thirds of students across the countries surveyed say they would like their university to offer the choice of more online learning if it means paying lower tuition fees, and when over half of students say they would prefer their university course to be shorter, if it was more affordable, we know something has to change,” he said.The survey also finds that over two-thirds (68 per cent) of Indian students think the country is a better place to live in than it was five years ago, the third highest of any country polled after China (92 per cent) and Saudi Arabia (77 per cent). By comparison, only 8 per cent of Argentinian students think their country is a better place to live, the lowest of any country polled.And, as many as 84 per cent  of Indian students believe they will own their own home before they are 35, the third highest of all the countries polled after Kenya (92 per cent) and Indonesia (86 per cent). By comparison, only 31 per cent of Japanese students believe they will see home ownership by the age of 35, the lowest of all the countries surveyed.Among some of the other key global findings, 56 per cent of students across all 21 surveyed countries say their mental health has suffered during the period of COVID-19 and over half (53 per cent) of all surveyed students have struggled with their living costs in the last year. Also, around 54 per cent of students say if it was cheaper, they would prefer their university degree take a shorter amount of time to complete, with jobs found to be the main motivation for students going to university.“Across the world, students have told us loud and clear that the biggest issues facing their generation are access to good quality jobs and growing inequality. Addressing these challenges is more important than ever in the wake of the economic devastation wrought by COVID, and education is the key,” said Lila Thomas, Chegg’s Director of Social Impact and Head of Chegg.org.The survey is based on in-depth opinion polling by Yonder, formerly known as Populus, of nearly 17,000 undergraduate students aged 18-21 years across 21 countries around the world, including 1,000 students in India.The Chegg.org “Global Student Survey” has been dubbed the most “comprehensive up-to-date survey” of the lives, hopes, and fears of undergraduate students throughout the world in the age of COVID and beyond. It is intended to provide authoritative national and global data that will help answer crucial questions impacting the youth, with its findings aimed at helping education professionals, policymakers, and leaders. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indians-rank-high-on-positivity-about-finances-in-new-global-student-survey-217810
26-02-2021||---||Committee set up to examine if payment gateway can be reporting entity under PMLA: Centre to HC||New Delhi, February 26The Centre told the Delhi High Court on Friday that it has set up a committee, as directed by it, on whether a company like PayPal can be considered a payment system operator as well as a reporting entity under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The submission was made before Justice Prathiba M Singh by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma who said the committee held a meeting on February 23 and another is scheduled on March 4 after which it would submit its final report.The court directed that the report be placed on record before the next date of hearing on May 20.It was hearing American online payment gateway PayPal’s plea challenging a Rs 96 lakh penalty imposed on it for alleged violation of anti-money laundering law.Justice Singh had on January 12 stayed the December 17, 2020 order of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) India imposing the penalty on PayPal, subject to the payment gateway maintaining records of all its transactions in a secure server and depositing within two weeks in the high court a bank guarantee of Rs 96 lakh.PayPal deposited the bank guarantee in the high court.On Friday, Justice Singh said the interim order in favour of PayPal shall continue till the next date of hearing.The FIU on December 17, 2020 had directed the company to pay the fine within 45 days and also register itself as a reporting entity with the FIU, appoint a principal officer and director for communication within a fortnight of the receipt of the order.      Under the law, a reporting entity is one which has to report to the authorities any foreign exchange financial transaction which occurs on its system.PayPal has contended that only a bank or an authorised dealer of foreign exchange will be a reporting entity and it is only a facilitator of financial transactions between registered banks and only charges a small amount as a “facilitator fee”.The FIU had told the high court that there is a provision for appeal against the December 17, 2020 order by approaching the appellate tribunal within one-and-a-half month.It had also contended that the plea ought to have been filed in the Bombay High Court which would be the appropriate forum.The FIU in its order had accused PayPal of contravening the PMLA and “concealing” suspect financial transactions and abetting “disintegration” of India’s financial system.Terming the contravention as “deliberate and wilful”, FIU held the company guilty on three broad counts, the fundamental being its failure to register itself as a “reporting entity” with the federal agency as mandated under the PMLA.As per the order, the legal tussle between the FIU and PayPal began in March, 2018 when the latter asked the company to register as a reporting entity for keeping “record” of all transactions, reporting suspicious transactions and cross-border wire transfers to the FIU and for identifying beneficiaries of these funds.The FIU analyses and shares these reports with various intelligence and investigative agencies for further action.As per the order issued under section 13 of the PMLA, PayPal refused the FIU’s directive and hence a show cause notice was issued to it in September 2019.PayPal defended its action and cited Reserve Bank of India guidelines to state that it only operates as an Online Payment Gateway Service Provider (OPGSP) or a payment intermediary in India and is “not covered within the definition of a payment system operator or financial institution and in turn, not covered under the definition of a reporting entity under the PMLA”.“Therefore, at this time, payment intermediaries, such as PayPal, are not required to register as such with the FIU-India,” it had said in its reply to the agency.The FIU, however, had rejected its claims and said PayPal was very much involved in handling funds in India, is a “financial institution” and hence qualifies to be a reporting entity under the PMLA.The FIU order had also said while the company “defies” the process in India, its parent company in the US — PayPal Inc — reports suspicious transactions to the American FIU and also to similar agencies in Australia and the UK. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/committee-set-up-to-examine-if-payment-gateway-can-be-reporting-entity-under-pmla-centre-to-hc-217809
26-02-2021||New Delhi||Farmer who died in Republic Day violence had no gunshot wounds: UP and Delhi police to HC||The 25-year-old farmer, who died after his tractor overturned during the protesting farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day, did not suffer any gunshot wounds, the police of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh have told the Delhi High Court.The police of the two states have made the submission relying upon the post-mortem and x-ray reports, given by the District Hospital at Rampur in UP, which prima facie state that “there was no gunshot injury in the body of the deceased”.       Delhi Police has said that according to the post-mortem report the young farmer died due to a head injury as a result of the accident and all his injuries were possible in a road accident.The submissions have been made in response to a plea by the deceased’s grandfather—Hardeep Singh—claiming that the victim suffered gunshot injuries to his head.The petition, filed through advocates Vrinda Grover and Soutik Banerjee, has sought a court-monitored SIT probe into the death of the young farmer.The high court on Friday listed the matter for further hearing on March 4.The Delhi Police, represented by Delhi government standing counsel  Rahul Mehra and advocate Chaitanya Gosain, has also relied upon the footage collected from CCTV cameras located at the site—Deen Dayal Upadhyay marg—where the young farmer died and said that he was driving the tractor at high speed and the vehicle overturned after hitting the barricades.It said that the footage also shows that the police personnel were running away for safety from the speeding tractor and that none of them fired upon the vehicle or the driver.                  The Delhi Police has also said that CCTV footage further indicates that the protestors did not take the injured Navreet Singh to any nearby hospital and instead they attacked the ambulances that reached the site after hearing about the accident.It said that the protestors instead of taking him to the hospital immediately, kept his body on the road for five hours and then spread rumours that he was killed in police firing.The UP police, in its status report, has stated that no FIR has been registered by it in connection with the death as claimed by the petitioner.“It is further submitted that there is no provision of giving the videography of the post-mortem or original X-ray plates which are medico-legal documents to the family of the deceased by the medical department,” it has said in its report.Grover, on the last date of hearing, had told the court that the way Delhi Police has conducted itself in the matter “does not inspire a shred of confidence”.She had said that the police abandoned all procedures, like carrying out inquest proceedings, conducting a post-mortem and lodging of an FIR, as required under the law, even if it was a case of accidental death.To this, the Delhi Police has said that once the cause of death was ascertained by the post-mortem report, there was no need for an inquest proceeding.Grover had also told the court that according to a UK-based pathologist, who saw the video of the incident and also perused the post-mortem report, the injuries on the victim were consistent with at least one or two gunshot wounds.She argued that this indicated that the victim lost control of the tractor, and it overturned as he was shot by the police personnel. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmer-who-died-in-republic-day-violence-had-no-gunshot-wounds-up-and-delhi-police-to-hc-217807
26-02-2021||New Delhi||Republic Day violence: Media house denies in HC any offensive reporting against Sikh community||A media house has denied before the Delhi High Court the allegations of indulging in “offensive and potentially fatal” attack on the Sikh community by airing on its channel unverified videos regarding the Republic Day protest by farmers against the new agri laws.In an affidavit filed in the high court, it has claimed that “not even a single assertion was made in relation to the Sikh community”.The affidavit has been filed in response to one of two PILs which have alleged that the media house “concocted”, “offensive and potentially fatal” attack on the Sikh community by circulating unverified videos regarding the Republic Day protest by farmers on its news platform.The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has also filed its response to one of the two PILs, saying it is the responsibility of the channel owner to ensure that a programme telecast on TV does not violate the Programme Code prescribed under the Cable Television Networks (CTN) Rules.“Whenever a violation of the Programme Code is brought to the notice of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, appropriate action is taken as per the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act,” said the affidavit, filed through Central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul.The ministry said it has also set up an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) to look into specific complaints regarding violation of the code.The affidavits of the ministry and the media house have been filed in response to the plea moved by Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa claiming that the “vicious campaign directed against a particular community at a time when public sentiments are flared up could result in disastrous consequences, including endangering the lives, property and liberty of members of that community”.A similar plea was moved by Delhi resident Manjit Singh GK contending that “allegations as made out in the said videos are absolutely untrue, baseless and a concoction of phantom imagination which bears no nexus to facts, whatsoever”.Denying the allegations against it, the media house has claimed that the plea by Dhindsa was an attempt to “impose fetters or stifle the reporting of the press”.It has also alleged that the petition was a “political gimmick to gain political mileage”.Referring to the CTN Act and Rules, the media house said, “There is a complete mechanism in relation to the regulation of the content of news broadcast in India. There is no further requirement of any additional legal structure or legislation in this regard.”   It has also contended that the petitioner has not approached the appropriate body, News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA), with any grievance before coming to the court. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/republic-day-violence-media-house-denies-in-hc-any-offensive-reporting-against-sikh-community-217798

26-02-2021||Kabul||Attack targets Afghan reporter’s family, kills 3: Officials||Three family members of an assassinated journalist in western Afghanistan have been killed by gunmen, local officials said Friday, amid a rising wave of attacks targeting journalists and civil society actors.Ghor provincial council member Hamidullah Mutahid said that at least five others were wounded in the attack late Thursday.The gunmen stormed the family home of Afghan journalist and activist Bismillah Adil Aimaq, who was shot dead in an unclaimed attack nearby Ghor on Jan. 1.No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack Aimaq’s family. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid quickly rejected the involvement of the militant group in the gun assault.The Islamic State group, blamed for a series of attacks on a range of targets in Afghanistan in recent months, claimed it had killed another Afghan journalist earlier in December. Two assailants opened fire and killed TV anchorwoman Malala Maiwand as she left her house in eastern Nangarhar province. Her driver was also killed.The deadly campaign against journalists and civil society activists comes as the Afghan government and Taliban representatives are struggling to hash out a peace deal in Doha. The majority of the attacks remain unclaimed and have pushed Afghan journalists toward self-censorship, immigration, or quitting their jobs.Earlier this week unknown gunmen shot and killed Khalil Narmgo, former head of a journalists association in the northern Baghlan province.A United Nations report released last week says that at least 11 human rights defenders and media workers were killed in targeted attacks in Afghanistan between September and the end of January 2021.An official in the Afghanistan Interior Ministry, speaking on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the media, said the five wounded in Thursday’s attack in Ghor were all children.Ghor provincial governor Noor Ahmad Kohnaward, while not providing any details to back up his claim, blamed the Taliban for the gun attack.The Afghan media advocacy organisation Nai said in a statement Friday that the government should investigate the wave of attacks on journalists. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/attack-targets-afghan-reporters-family-kills-3-officials-217794

26-02-2021||Surat||AAP sets eyes on 2022 Gujarat Assembly polls after strong show in Surat||Buyoed by the Aam Aadmi Party's   good performance in the recently-held Surat civic polls, party chief Arvind Kejriwal has now set his eyes on the 2022 Gujarat Assembly polls.Kejriwal, who arrived in Surat on Friday, said that AAP would seek votes from the people of the state in the next Assembly polls based on the performance of the party's 27 newly-elected corporators in the city.Polls to six civic bodies in Gujarat, including in Surat, were held on Sunday.While the BJP retained power in the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) by winning 93 seats, the AAP bagged the remaining 27 seats. The Congress failed to win even a single seat.During his address to the party corporators here, Kejriwal said, "The people of Gujarat are watching you with great hope. In our first attempt, AAP won 28 Assembly seats in Delhi and came to power. People trusted us because they knew that we are true patriots, as we were associated with Anna Hazare's agitation.""In the 49 days of our rule, we did a lot of pro- people work. As a result, the people of Delhi gave us 67 seats in the second election. Now, six crore people of Gujarat will observe the work of 27 AAP corporators. If you perform well, I am sure there will be a huge revolution in 2022," the Delhi chief minister added.Fearing a "poaching attempt", Kejriwal warned the elected representatives to inform the party leaders if "anyone from the BJP" contacts them over phone and gives an offer to switch sides."I am sure that BJP people will call you. But remember, our true wealth is people's trust. If anyone of you switches side, it will break the trust of six crore people.Even if one person switches side, the BJP and others will get a chance to say that AAP is no different from others," he said.The AAP convenor urged the newly-elected corporators to be ready to help the people of their respective wards, and also asked them to share their phone numbers in their areas so that citizens can contact them easily."Even if you are not able to do someone's work, never insult those who approach you for help. Always show respect to the people. We will seek votes from the people of Gujarat on the basis of your performance here," he added.Kejriwal is scheduled to conduct a road show in the city on Friday.

However, petitioner's counsel asked the court to allow him to withdraw the petition with the liberty to participate in the inquiry.On February 16, the Supreme Court made sharp observations on the conduct of a district judge from Madhya Pradesh, who sent offensive and inappropriate messages to a junior officer and justified this conduct as mere "flirting".Senior advocate Ravindra Shrivastava along with advocate Arjun Garg, representing Madhya Pradesh High Court, read out several WhatsApp messages sent by the District Judge to junior lady officer. Shrivastava said he is a senior judicial officer; hence his conduct should have been more appropriate with the lady officer.The top court had noted: "WhatsApp messages are quite offensive and improper. For a judge this conduct with junior officer-not acceptable."  The bench queried that if they have some understanding with each other is it good to go ahead? However, the bench added that the petitioner has already learnt a lesson and pointed at a settlement between the parties.Shrivastava replied that the woman officer wanted a settlement, but the High Court Committee probing this matter did not accept it.He added the petitioner has admitted that he was flirting with the lady. "What kind of judicial officer is this? We don't understand," added Shrivastava. At this stage, the Chief Justice said it agrees with Shrivastava's submissions.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-cant-allow-sexual-harassment-cases-to-be-swept-under-carpet-217779

Accused Kumbhar is a resident of Mundra district at West Kachchh in Gujarat, they added.“Accused Kumbhar was arrested on September 30, 2020, and further investigation revealed that he had visited Pakistan twice on legal documents. During his return in the course of second visit, Kumbhar had come in contact with Pakistani ISI operatives Hamid @Asim and he had joined the conspiracy with the co-accused.

This position is at variance with India’s current stand that terror and talks cannot go together.Price described Pakistan as an important partner with “whom we share many interests”.“We have been clear in terms of this issue. Obviously, Pakistan has an important role to play when it comes to Afghanistan and what takes place across its other border. So clearly we will be paying close attention, and we urge the Pakistanis to play a constructive role in all of these areas of mutual interest, including in Afghanistan, including with Kashmir, including with our other shared interests,” he observed.Price had been asked how Biden’s warm relationship with Pakistan, when he was Vice President, portended for his policy towards Pakistan now that he’s President and how that would interplay with his relationship with India. In his answer, Price skipped the part about India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-welcomes-indo-pakistan-loc-ceasefire-217775

26-02-2021||Mumbai||Arthur Road jail keeps special cell ready to lodge Nirav Modi||With a UK court ruling in favour of extradition of fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering in Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, Mumbai's Arthur Road jail has kept a special cell ready to lodge him, an official said on Friday.The jail official said that once Nirav Modi is brought to Mumbai, he will be kept in one of the three cells of barrack number 12, which is a high security barrack."Preparations for lodging Nirav Modi in the jail have been completed and the prison cell is ready for him, whenever he is extradited," he said.In a comprehensive extradition win for the Indian authorities, a UK judge ruled on Thursday that fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi not only has a case to answer in the Indian courts but that there is no evidence to suggest he would not receive a fair trial in India. Modi lost his nearly two-year-long legal battle against extradition on all grounds.The 49-year-old jeweller has been repeatedly denied bail due to the seriousness of the allegations against him and remains behind bars in a London prison since his arrest in March 2019.The Maharashtra prisons department had in 2019 shared the information with the Centre about the status of the prison and facilities for lodging Nirav Modi.The Centre had sought information about it from the state home department as extradition proceedings for Nirav Modi had then advanced before the Westminster Magistrates Court in the UK, the official said.The state government had submitted a letter of assurance to the Centre about the facilities, which they can provide inside the prison.The prison department had also assured that Modi will be kept in a cell, where the number of detainees will be few.If lodged in the barrack, Modi likely to get three square meters of personal space, where a cotton mat, pillow, bedsheet and blanket will be provided, the official said.The prison department had also assured adequate light, ventilation and storage for personal belongings, he said.According to the official, the authorities had earlier told the government that if fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya is extradited to India from the UK, he would be lodged in the same barrack (number 12) at Arthur Road Jail.The state government had furnished a similar letter of assurance to the Centre with respect to Mallya, who is facing charges of money laundering and fraud in India.Mallya has been based in the UK since March 2016. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arthur-road-jail-keeps-special-cell-ready-to-lodge-nirav-modi-217767

26-02-2021||Mumbai||People’s mandate no licence to act ‘irresponsibly’: Sena on stadium renaming||The Shiv Sena on Friday targeted the Centre over the renaming of Ahmedabad’s Sardar Patel cricket stadium after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that the massive mandate that his government got in the last election was not a licence to act irresponsibly.It also said although allegations were made against the Congress and Gandhi-Nehru family in the last five years that they are trying to obliterate Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s name from history, the renaming of the stadium has shown who is actually trying to do so.“It seems the Modi-Shah government wants every big thing to be set up in Gujarat. There is nothing wrong in that. But they seem to have forgotten that they are leading the country...The name of Motera stadium in Ahmedabad was changed to Narendra Modi stadium. Till now, Melbourne stadium was the largest cricket stadium in the world. Now the one named after Modi is the biggest one,” the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.“But why is the move drawing flak? Because earlier the Motera stadium was named after Sardar Patel, which has now been named after Modi. In the last five years, it was alleged that attempts were made by the Congress or Gandhi-Nehru family to obliterate the name of Sardar Patel. But the change in the name of Sardar Patel stadium shows who is trying to wipe out his name,” it said.There was no doubt that Modi is a great leader but if his blind followers felt that he was greater than Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Nehru, Sardar Patel or Indira Gandhi, it should be considered the next level in blind faith, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.Those who thought of renaming Motera stadium after Narendra Modi had, in fact,sss reduced his stature, it added.“Modi is a very popular leader. People have given him massive mandate. But this mandate is not a licence to act irresponsibly. Patel and Nehrualso had mandate of the people to lay the foundation stone of the country’s development,” the Sena said.“Nehru dedicated institutions such as the IITs, BARC, the Bhakra Nagal project to the country. But what happened under the Modi’s rule? A stadium named after Sardar Patel was renamed as Narendra Modi stadium,” it said.Those who eulogised Patel till yesterday, were now against his name for a stadium, the party said.“It shows that Patel’s importance in today’s politics has ended and the same will happen to Netaji Bose after theWest Bengal polls. In Maharashtra, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s name was also used for elections,” it added.“Which policies of Sardar Patel are being followed by the current government? He led the Bardolisatyagraha for the rights of farmers. But what is the farmers’ situation now?” the party asked.During the Congress meeting held in Karachi two years after the satyagraha, Patel, who was the party president then, declared that he was a farmer.“But, what is the condition of farmers in the country now. They have been protesting at Delhi borders since the last four months...They are hailing Sardar Patel. Is that the reason, the name plate at Motera stadium bearing his name was wiped out?” it asked.But it was the people who wanted this. The citizens of Gujarat had accepted this change. If the people of Gujarat had no regards for Patel, then there was no need for the opposition to criticise the move, it said.

A similar statement on following the pact was issued in May 2018 after the neighbours exchanged some serious firing following which the DGMOs spoke to each other.The DGMOs and their officials had been talking as the civilian population on either side was getting hit due to the cross-LoC firing.Indian officials said the agreement did not mean that counter-terrorism operations in J&K or action to check infiltration along the border would stop. The agreement was only about not firing across at civilian population, they said.“In the interest of achieving mutually beneficial and sustainable peace along the border, the DGMOs agreed to address each other’s core issues and concerns, which have propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence,” the Defence Ministry in India said.Both sides reiterated that existing mechanisms of hotline contact and border flag meetings would be utilised to resolve any unforeseen situation or misunderstanding.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-pak-agree-on-strict-observance-of-loc-pacts-217587

While trade and ceasefire are low-hanging fruits, sources said Islamabad was looking at a gesture from India on Kashmir.MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said India was always ready for talks to address issues, if any. On key issues, the Indian position remained unchanged, he said when asked if New Delhi was still maintaining its position that terror and talks could not go together.Pakistan is understood to have conveyed that it expected some kind of statement from India about not changing the demography in Kashmir.Sources said Islamabad had claimed there was no state-sponsored cross-border militancy, though a sure giveaway of its involvement had been the tell-tale cover firing on Indian posts to facilitate infiltration. They expect Pakistan to take some more hard action on cross-border terrorism as Biden’s consistent stand ever since he was a Senator two decades back was that this kind of activity was inconsistent with the desire to settle the Kashmir dispute by bilateral talks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/resuming-wagah-trade-could-be-next-step-to-restoring-india-pakistan-ties-217590

This is the first time such rules have been framed for digital and online media. The development comes weeks after a spat between the government and Twitter over certain messages around farmers’ protests that the government saw as inciting violence. “There has been rampant misuse of social media. The medium is being used by terrorists and criminals, even those sitting across the border,” said Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.The government has proposed voluntary verification of users and asked the firms to have a compliance officer, grievance officer and a nodal officer, all based in India.The digital news media has been brought under the purview of Information Technology Act.

The court has now recommended Nirav’s extradition to the UK Home Secretary, Priti Patel.Patel is authorised to order an extradition under the India-UK extradition treaty and has two months to make the decision.Technically, Nirav has two weeks to appeal to the High Court in case Patel decides to extradite him. The UK Home Ministry rarely goes against a court ruling like this unless there is a risk of the person being awarded the death penalty. At the same time, the judge lashed out at the Indian agencies for “poorly presented” documentation and hoped that New Delhi would take “these observations on board in relation to future requests”. The judge also pointed out that those Indian agencies had submitted 16 volumes of evidence, including 16 bundles of expert reports and defence evidence and 32 folders of documents.The judge had ruled that Nirav not only had a case to answer in the Indian courts but that there was no evidence to suggest he would not receive a fair trial in India. He is wanted on charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated Rs 15,000-crore PNB scam case.District Judge Samuel Goozee also ruled that there were no human rights concerns following several assurances from New Delhi.Modi appeared via video link from his London prison wearing a formal suit and sporting a thick beard.

Governments can be toppled fraudulently with money power, but it won’t bring about the desired social change. — Shanta Kumar, HP Ex-CMStrict laws neededIf the political scenario has to be changed, the PM must bring in stringent laws to curb the use of black money in elections. — Shanta Kumar, HP Ex-CMCautioning the BJP against adopting “unprincipled” politics, he says, “The people made the BJP the world’s largest party due to its idealism, but now it has become power-hungry.” Shanta, a member of the BJP’s sidelined “Marg Darshak Mandal”, has made the observations in his autobiography “Nij Path ka Avichal Panthi”, released two days ago.“We all join politics to change the society, not governments. ‘Chal kapat ki rajneeti se sarkarein toh badli ja sakti hain, par samajh nahin’ (Governments can be toppled fraudulently with money power, but it won’t bring about the desired social change), he writes, attributing the remarks to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He says he has always sworn by the politics of principles and wished his party, “which has the capacity to change Indian politics”, doesn’t deviate from the politics of principles.Incidentally, Shanta’s remarks on the “BJP’s horse-trading” have come at a time when the Congress has been accusing the saffron party of toppling its government in Puducherry. Known for speaking his mind even if it meant paying a heavy price, Shanta’s autobiography has kicked up a political storm with the Congress demanding a probe.A writer and a poet with several books to his credit, he claims he has paid a heavy price for calling a spade a spade, but “had no regrets about it”.If the political scenario has to be changed, writes Shanta, Prime Minister Narendra Modi must bring in stringent laws to curb the use of black money in elections and keep criminals out of politics.Shanta’s book was expected to unravel several truths, one being “he lost his chair in the Union Cabinet in 2003 for unearthing a Rs 300 crore scam when he was the Rural Development Minister”. “I brought the facts to the notice of the then PM Vajpayee…. instead of initiating action against the culprits, I was forced to step down,” he writes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-horse-trading-shameful-former-himachal-cm-shanta-in-his-book-217599

There will also be a walk-in provision for the beneficiaries to get themselves registered at a nearby session site to get vaccinated,” RS Sharma, chairman of the Empowered Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Administration, said.He said the new version of the Co-WIN platform would be GPS-enabled and the beneficiaries would have the option to choose the inoculation session site both at the government and private facilities.There will be volunteers to help those opting for walk-in registration with the process if they are not tech-savvy.Co-WIN, a digital platform, was created for real-time monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine delivery.One will also have the option to get inoculated in a state different from his or her home state.People aged above 45 years will have to upload a medical certificate mentioning their co-morbid conditions. The government is yet to specify the conditions that would be included in the over-45 age group with co-morbidities.“Co-WIN will be able to take registrations and appointments from multiple applications, including Aarogya Setu or any other application such as a common service app,” Sharma said.A beneficiary will just have to register with his mobile number and in turn, will receive an OTP with which his account will be created. One can also get their family members registered on the account.The second phase of the world’s largest vaccination drive will start from Monday, in which anybody above 60 years, that may not be less than 10 crore people in the country, and above 45 years with co-morbidities will be administered the vaccine at 10,000 government medical facilities and over 20,000 private hospitals, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Wednesday.“Whoever goes to a government centre will be administered the vaccine free of cost. The Indian government will pay for them. The government will purchase the necessary doses and send them to all the states,” he said.“Those who want to get vaccinated at private hospitals, will have to pay and the amount will be decided by the Health Ministry within the next three-four days as it is in discussions with the vaccine manufacturers as well as the hospitals,” Javadekar said.Asked if people would have a choice as regards which vaccine — Covishield or Covaxin — they want to take, the Minister said the country was proud to have two vaccines, both of which are effective with proven efficacy.While Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covishield is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India in Pune, Covaxin is being produced by Bharat Biotech.

26-02-2021||London||PNB scam case: UK judge orders Nirav Modi to be extradited to India||In a comprehensive extradition win for the Indian authorities, a UK judge has ruled on Thursday that fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi not only has a case to answer in the Indian courts but that there is no evidence to suggest he would not receive a fair trial in India.Nirav Modi, wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated $2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, lost his legal battle against extradition on all grounds as District Judge Samuel Goozee also concluded that there are no human rights concerns that his medical needs would not be addressed as per several Indian government assurances.The 49-year-old appeared via video link at Westminster Magistrates’ Court from Wandsworth Prison in south-west London, dressed in a formal suit and sporting a thick beard, and showed no emotion as excerpts of the judgment were read out in court.Also read: Chronology of Nirav Modi’s caseFrom flashy diamantaire to fugitive: Nirav Modi’s long road to extradition“I am satisfied that there is evidence upon which Nirav Deepak Modi could be convicted in relation [to] the conspiracy to defraud the PNB. A prima facie case is established,” the judge noted.He similarly concludes a prima facie case to have been established on all counts of charges brought by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) — money laundering, intimidation of witnesses and disappearance of evidence.“I am not required to exclude all Mr Modi’s various alternative theoretical possibilities and narratives; nor exclude his personal interpretation of the evidence, in order to find a prima facie case has been established,” the judge noted, referring to the extradition case of former Kingfisher Airlines boss Vijay Mallya as precedent.He accepted that while Nirav’s mental health had deteriorated due to the lengthy incarceration in a London prison, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, his risk of suicide does not meet the high threshold to satisfy him that his mental state is such that it would be “unjust or oppressive” to extradite him.Under the UK Extradition Act 2003, the judge will now send his findings to the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, Priti Patel. It is the UK Cabinet minister who is authorised to order an extradition under the India-UK Extradition Treaty and has two months within which to make that decision.The Home Secretary’s order rarely goes against the court’s conclusions, as she has to consider only some very narrow bars to extradition which are unlikely to apply in this case, including the possible imposition of a death penalty.Whatever the ministerial decision, the losing side — Nirav Modi — has up to 14 days within which to approach the High Court and seek leave to appeal after the Home Secretary has made her decision known.Nirav’s legal team did not immediately confirm if he intends to appeal against Thursday’s ruling. Any appeal, if granted, will be heard at the Administrative Division of the High Court in London.Nirav Modi, meanwhile, remains on remand at Wandsworth Prison until the Home Secretary’s decision to sign off on the extradition order.The flashy diamond merchant was arrested on an extradition warrant on March 19, 2019, and has appeared via videolink from Wandsworth Prison for a series of court hearings in the extradition case. His multiple attempts at seeking bail have been repeatedly turned down, both at the Magistrates’ and High Court level, as he was deemed a flight risk.Nirav is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of letters of undertaking (LoUs) or loan agreements, and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud. He also faces two additional charges of “causing the disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death”, which were added on to the CBI case.In the judgment clearing the path to extradition, the judge accepted the arguments put forth by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) — arguing in court on behalf of the Indian government — that Nirav in collusion with bank officials oversaw a “ponzi-like scheme” structure where LoUs were used to repay earlier ones.“I do not accept the submissions that NDM was involved in legitimate business and using the LoUs in a permissible fashion…I find there is no evidence of genuine import transactions and the applications for the LoUs was being done dishonestly,” the ruling notes.“Considering the entirety of the evidence, the dummy directors’ evidence in their statements supports the ponzi-like scheme and the operation of the fraud set out in the statements from the PNB officials,” it adds.The judge highlighted how he had received 16 volumes of evidence from the government of India (GOI), as many as 16 bundles of expert reports and defence evidence and a total of 32 lever-arch folders of documents, all of which he has considered in his ruling. He was, however, extremely critical of the “poorly presented” documentation by the Indian authorities and stressed: “I hope the GOI take these observations on board in relation to future requests.”The judge also noted that given the high public and media interest in the case, he did not believe there was any reason for him to doubt the Indian government’s assurances.“I am also required to consider the length and strength of relations between India and this country…There is no reliable evidence of the GOI breaching their solemn diplomatic assurance,” the judge concluded.

26-02-2021||New Delhi||Govt announces new guidelines to curb misuse of social media platforms||Weeks after a spat with Twitter, the government on Thursday announced the tightening of rules governing social media and streaming companies, requiring them to take down contentious content quicker, appoint grievance redressal officers and assist investigations.The ‘Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code’, that IT and Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said are designed to curb misuse of social media platforms, requires WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and other social media firms, as well as streaming services such as Netflix, YouTube and Amazon Prime Video, to appoint executives to coordinate with law enforcement, disclose the first originator of the mischievous information and remove, within 24 hours, content depicting nudity or morphed pictures of women.Any contentious content flagged by the government or legal order has to be taken down quickly.Also read: Social media platforms have to abide by Indian laws: Amit ShahGovt releases salient features of new rules for OTT, social media playersThe guidelines require social media intermediaries to appoint a resident grievance officer, who shall register complaints in 24 hours, and file monthly compliance reports. User grievances have to be resolved within 15 days.Also, social media platforms on being asked by court or government will be required to disclose the first originator of the mischievous information that undermines the sovereignty of India, security of the state, or public order.The intermediary, however, will not be required to disclose the contents of any message.Beyond streaming and messaging, the code will also set guidelines for digital publishers of news and current affairs content, requiring them to disclose their ownership and other information.Releasing the guidelines, Prasad said the code was needed to make social media and OTT companies accountable for “misuse and abuse”.“Social media firms should be more responsible and accountable,” he said.The new guidelines follow the government’s spat with Twitter over allegedly inflammatory tweets and hashtags supporting farmer protests, with the microblogging service initially refusing to comply with orders to take down about 1,500 such posts and accounts. Twitter complied after it was threatened with the penal action.Separately, an Amazon Prime Video original series “Tandav” was ordered by authorities to be re-edited following protests over its depiction of Hindu gods and goddesses.Freedom-of-speech activists and technology trade groups had previously criticised the draft version of the new rules, which replace a previous code from 2011, saying they would result in increased censorship and reduced user privacy.The new rules take effect immediately, though significant social-media providers (based on number of users) will get three months before they need to start complying.Prasad said concerns had been raised over the rampant abuse of social media platforms and the spread of fake news.“Social media companies are welcome to do business in India and empower Indians. We welcome criticism and dissent but it is important that users of social media are given a proper forum for the resolution of their grievances in a time-bound manner,” he said.India is a large market for digital and social media companies and is witnessing strong growth on the back of booming smartphone sales and the availability of dirt-cheap data.The country has 53 crore WhatsApp users, 44.8 crore YouTube users, 41 crore Facebook users, 21 crore use Instagram and 1.75 crore are on Twitter.Prasad said the rules require the “significant” social media intermediaries to follow additional due diligence including the appointment of a chief compliance officer, a nodal contact person and a resident grievance officer. All three officials will have to reside in India. They will have to publish monthly compliance report and detail contents removed proactively.The rules also state that users, who voluntarily want to verify their accounts, should be given an appropriate mechanism to do so and be accorded a visible mark of verification.Users will have to be provided with a prior intimation and explanation when a significant social media intermediary removes content on its own. In such cases, users have to be provided an adequate and reasonable opportunity to dispute the action taken by the intermediary.Rules related to social media will be administered by the Ministry of Electronics and IT while those related to Code of Ethics and procedure and safeguards, in relation to digital media, will be administered by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.On rules related to over-the-top (OTT) and digital media, the government said, guidelines had been framed keeping in mind the difference between viewership in a theatre and television, as compared to watching it on the internet.A Code of Ethics and three-tier grievance redressal mechanism would be applicable for news publishers, OTT platforms and digital media.OTT platforms would have to self-classify the content into five age-based categories - U (Universal), U/A 7+ (years), U/A 13+, U/A 16+, and A (Adult).Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Minister Prakash Javadekar said such platforms would be required to implement parental locks for content classified as U/A 13+ or higher, and reliable age-verification mechanisms for content classified as ‘A’.The publishers of online curated content will also have to prominently display the classification rating specific to a programme together with a content descriptor, he added.“Publishers of news on digital media would be required to observe Norms of Journalistic Conduct of the Press Council of India and the Programme Code under the Cable Television Networks Regulation Act, providing a level-playing field between the offline (print, TV) and digital media,” an official statement said.“Digital media portals have no right to spread rumours. The media’s freedom is absolute but with reasonable restrictions. Content matter, especially media, OTT and digital media will be administered by the I&B ministry. Intermediary platforms monitoring will be done by the IT Ministry in the manner they have been doing it,” he said.
