We were weak in Punjab and used to fight polls in alliance with the Akali Dal. This time we fought separately, which caused us losses,” he said while speaking at Guwahati. Tomar is the BJP’s election in-charge in the poll-bound Assam where the party has an incumbent government.Notably, the BJP’s  drubbing in Punjab has been linked directly with the three laws, against which Punjab emerged as the epicentre.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-drubbing-in-punjab-local-bodies-polls-no-link-to-farm-stir-says-narendra-tomar-214311

In fact, a multipolar world and multipolar Asia are not possible without India and Russia,” he said during his address at the Diplomatic Academy.The two countries will add another pillar to their bilateral ties with Sputnik V vaccine undergoing tests in India. “The authorisation is at the earliest possible stage after which we will jointly manufacture this vaccine and distribute it in different parts of the world,” he said.Shringla is in Moscow to chart a busy calendar of interactions with Russia during this year what will culminate in a summit meeting between PM Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Speaking against the backdrop of Lavrov last year expressing doubts about the US-led concept of Indo-Pacific, Shringla made it clear that it is an “article of faith” for India to press for the maritime space to be guided by norms and governed by rules, with freedom of navigation and respect for the territorial integrity.The Foreign Secretary also referred to growing cooperation in traditional areas of defence, fossil fuel, nuclear energy and space sectors besides calling for stepping up a partnership in infrastructure and connectivity initiatives.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-pitches-for-expanded-ties-with-russia-214306

Shabnam had filed a mercy petition before the President, which has now been turned down.It may be recalled that on April 15, 2008, Shabnam and her lover Saleem had wiped out the former’s entire family in Amroha district in Uttar Pradesh. The duo was having an affair and wanted to get married. However, the woman’s family was opposed to their marriage.Shabnam made her family members drink milk laced with sedatives before killing them along with her lover. Seven members of the family, including a 10-month-old child, were then axed to death on the night of horror.The reaction to the multiple murders was so strong that people who had named their daughters as Shabnam had changed the names almost overnight.Meanwhile, Shabnam’s uncle and aunt have expressed happiness at the court verdict.“We were not at home when the carnage took place. When we went there at around 2 am, there was blood all around and the bodies were cut up. The crime was unpardonable,” said her uncle, refusing to disclose his name.He further said he would not accept the body of Shabnam after her hanging.Meanwhile, Pawan Jallad, who had executed the four accused in the Nirbhaya case in March last year, will be executing Shabnam and Salim in Mathura jail, which houses the country’s lone female execution room.Pawan said he had been asked to inspect the Mathura jail for the hanging and he is ready for the job even though the date for the hanging has not been set yet.

18-02-2021||Kakdwip (WB)||TMC brought cut-money and syndicate culture, BJP will bring development in Bengal: Shah||Alleging that the TMC government has introduced a “cut-money and syndicate culture” in West Bengal, Union Home Minister Amit Shah Thursday said if voted to power BJP would constitute an inquiry into the siphoning off cyclone Amphan relief funds and book the culprits.Shah said BJP’s ‘Parivartan Yatra’ is not for changing a chief minister, an MLA or a minister but ending infiltration and transforming West Bengal into a developed state.“This is BJP’s fight to make Bengal ‘Sonar Bangla’ (Golden Bengal). This fight is between our booth workers and the syndicate of TMC. It is not just our aim to bring BJP government after removing Mamata Banerjee’s ministry.“Our goal is to ensure that there is a change in the situation in West Bengal, a change in the condition of the poor of the state, a change in circumstances for women of the state,” he said.“This ‘Parivartan Yatra’ is for ending infiltration and also for the transformation of Bengal. You vote for the BJP.Leave alone illegal immigrants, not even a bird from across the border will be allowed to enter the state,”Shah said after flagging off the final leg of the five phased Rath yatra in the state.Criticising TMCs “cut money” culture, Shah said if voted to power, the government will probe corruption in disbursal of cyclone Amphan relief funds.“The central government had sent relief and funds post Amphan for affected people. But, the TMC leaders siphoned off the funds and did not allow it to reach the affected people.“If we are voted to power, the government will constitute an inquiry committee to probe corruption in disbursal of Amphan relief funds. All those who have indulged in corruption would be sent to jails,” he said.Super cyclonic storm Amphan had caused widespread damage in West Bengal, Odisha and neighbouring Bangladesh in May 2020.Shah also announced that the BJP will constitute ‘Zero Casualty Task Force’ to save lives from cyclones and environmental disasters if voted to power.Speaking on the controversy over ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogan, Shah said, Bengal CM gets angry at the slogan due to her appeasement politics.“You get angry over it because you want to appease a particular section of the people for vote bank politics. Jai Shri Ram slogan is a symbol against anti-appeasement policies,” he said.Banerjee had on January 23 declined to speak at an event to celebrate Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary where “Jai Shri Ram” slogans were raised in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Flaying TMCs appeasement politics, Shah said it is under BJPs pressure that Banerjee is now seen worshipping Goddess Saraswati.“Should the Durga Puja not take place in West Bengal?Court permission needs to be obtained for it. Should the Saraswati Puja not be held here? She had stopped it.“It was only after BJP’s pressure that she was seen worshipping Goddess Saraswati. Didi, Bengal knows that you had stopped Saraswati puja in schools,” Shah said.Listing out the names of some BJP workers allegedly killed in politial violence in the state, Shah alleged that the Mamata Banerjee government has created an environment of fear and panic, but the BJP is ready to take on the “goons” of the ruling TMC.“You think that we can get intimidated by the TMC goons?They cannot stall BJP’s march to power. Once we are in power, every perpetrator of violence that led to the killing of BJP workers will be thrown behind bars,” he asserted while claiming that TMC goons have so far killed its more than 130 workers.Lashing out at “dynastic politics” in the TMC, Shah alleged that Banerjee has been working only for the welfare of her nephew instead of the masses.“The TMC government is only interested about ‘bhatija kalyan’ (nephew’s welfare). It is not interested about peoples welfare,” he said.The union minister said the BJP is ready to take on the “goons” and the “syndicates” of the ruling TMC.“We have to end this syndicate rule of TMC, where if you want to build a house you need to pay money. If you need anything you have to pay money to TMC leaders. The BJP will end this culture,” he said.Shah also reached out to the West Bengal government employees and said the 7th Pay Commission will be implemented in the state if the saffron party is voted to power.“The financial condition of Bengal is so bad that the state government employees don’t get the benefits of the 7th Pay Commission. If voted to power we would implement it in the state,” he said.The BJP leader said Banerjee has deprived masses of the benefits of many central schemes and the people have decided to elect a BJP government in Bengal in the upcoming assembly polls. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-brought-cut-money-and-syndicate-culture-bjp-will-bring-development-in-bengal-shah-214286

18-02-2021||Pailan (WB)||First fight Abhishek, then me: Mamata challenges Amit Shah||Hitting out at Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s ‘Didi-Bhaipo’ jibes, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday challenged him to contest an election against her nephew Abhishek Banerjee and then think of fighting her.Addressing a party rally in Pailan in the South 24 Parganas district, Banerjee said that Abhishek could have taken the easy route of being an MP by choosing to be a Rajya Sabha member but he fought the Lok Sabha election and got the people’s mandate.“Day and night they are talking about Didi-Bhatija. I challenge Amit Shah, contest against Abhishek Banerjee first and then me,” she said, amid a loud cheer from supporters.BJP leaders, including Shah, have often accused Banerjee of dynasty politics, alleging that her ‘Bhaipo’ or nephew has received preferential treatment and will eventually be made the chief minister of the state.“How come your son became a part of the cricket administration and made hundreds of crores of rupees?” Banerjee said, in a direct attack at Shah.She also challenged the home minister to get her into politics and toil to hold public offices.Banerjee exuded confidence that her party will break all records of past elections in the state, get most of the votes and win the highest number of seats in the upcoming polls. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-fight-abhishek-then-me-mamata-challenges-amit-shah-214262

In Mumbai, petrol is now costing Rs 96.32 a litre and diesel Rs 87.32.Patole said the common man has been affected a lot by the increase in prices of petrol and diesel.Filmstars like Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, through their tweets, had earlier criticised the fuel price rise during the Manmohan Singh-led government, he said.Why are they silent now on the rising petrol and diesel prices? he asked.“If they do not take a stand now on the injustice meted out by the Modi government, we will not let any films (screening) or shootings of Amitabh Bachchan or Akshay Kumar in Maharashtra,” the Congress leader said.युपीएच्या काळात इंधनाचे दर ७० रु झाल्यावर टीव टीव करणारे @SrBachchan, @akshaykumar आज पेट्रोलचे दर १०० रु. झाल्यावरही गप्प का आहेत? सर्वसामान्य जनतेची लूट करणाऱ्या मोदी सरकारविरोधात गप्प असणाऱ्या या सेलिब्रिटींच्या पिक्चरचे शुटींग महाराष्ट्रात होऊ देणार नाही.. pic.twitter.com/PEmirXQIe6  They should now play the same role and protest against the central government’s “anti-national policy”, as they did during Manmohan Singh’s tenure, Patole said.He also criticised the BJP-led central government on the FASTag system for vehicles.The Centre had made FASTags mandatory from February 15 to midnight and said any vehicle not fitted with it will be charged double the toll at electronic toll plazas across the country.The Ministry of Road Transport & Highways clarified that this has been done to further promote fee payment through digital mode, reduce waiting time and fuel consumption, and provide for a seamless passage through the fee plazas. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-congress-chief-threatens-to-stop-amitabh-bachchan-akshay-kumars-film-shoots-214253

Many regions and groups followed our example, he said.The hopes of the region and the world were focussed now on rapid deployment of vaccines, and they should maintain the same collaborative spirit, Modi said in his brief address.Health cooperation in the region had already achieved so much, the Prime Minister said, asking if the region now could raise its ambitions further.Modi also made certain suggestions to foster the collaborative spirit to help each other.He asked if a special visa scheme for doctors and nurses could be created so that they could travel quickly within the region during health emergencies.Modi also proposed that a regional platform be created for collating, compiling and studying the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines among the region’s populations.India’s health schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, an insurance scheme for the poor, could be taken up as a case study by other countries, he said.

It is for ending infiltration and also for the transformation of Bengal. You vote for the BJP. Leave alone illegal immigrants, not even a bird from across the border will be allowed to enter the state,” Shah said addressing a rally here.He also spoke about the killings of BJP workers and warned that the perpetrators will be thrown behind bars.The union minister said the BJP is ready to take on the “goons” and the “syndicates” of the ruling TMC.Speaking on the controversy over the ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogan, Shah said, “Bengal CM gets angry at the slogan due to her appeasement politics.”Banerjee had on January 23 declined to speak at an event to celebrate Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary where “Jai Shri Ram” slogans were raised in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Shah also slammed the TMC dispensation in the state for alleged corruption in disbursing ‘Amphan’ relief funds.“The central government had sent relief funds after ‘Amphan’ cyclone, the money was siphoned off by the TMC leaders. If voted to power, we will probe into this corruption. We will form a task force for saving lives from cyclones and environmental disasters,” he said.Shah also reached out to the West Bengal government employees and said the 7th Pay Commission will be implemented in the state if the saffron party is voted to power.“The financial condition of Bengal is so bad that the state government employees don’t get the benefits of the 7th Pay Commission. If voted to power we would implement it in the state,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-will-end-cut-money-culture-bring-development-in-bengal-if-voted-to-power-shah-214250

And, the plan of armoured thrust by Pakistan army itself was brilliant in terms of the area and axis chosen, the Longewala-Jaisalmer axis, and if it had succeeded, it would have changed the course of the war on the western front and the final result,” Bhadauria said.“The only thing the Pakistan army probably forgot to factor, was India’s air power. And, they thought what half a squadron of Hunter aircraft sitting in Jaisalmer could do, and that was probably their only mistake,” he said.The IAF chief also said the Battle of Longewala brings to light a scenario where air power can bring “asymmetric results if time and place chosen correctly”.“On air power, over the decades, we have learned our lessons well, and graduated to a stage where it has been incorporated deep into our plan, synergy and interaction with the services,” he said.The IAF chief said it was important that stories of valour are documented in books and passed on to the next generations. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistans-plan-was-brilliant-but-it-didnt-factor-in-indias-air-power-iaf-chief-on-battle-of-longewala-214220

18-02-2021||New Delhi||Vindication and hope: Ramani’s acquittal blazes a trail||Vindication and hope summed up all shades of reactions to the historic rejection of MJ Akbar’s defamation case against journalist Priya Ramani who stuck to the truth for two years and triumphed in the ultimate battle of nerves on Wednesday.As Akbar’s claim of “damage to his stellar reputation” crumbled under the weight of Ramani and her fellow scribe Ghazala Wahab’s shocking accounts of sexual and psychological assault at the hands of the former editor, a sense of victory pervaded every heart that stood in solidarity with the duo.“I feel vindicated and hope this verdict would help more and more women speak up besides discouraging men in positions of power from filing false cases against those who share their truth,” said a beaming Ramani who would have leave her ten-year-old daughter in Bengaluru to attend 53 hearings in Delhi through more than 28 months.Ramani repeated on Thursday what she had all along maintained in court – “Akbar’s criminal defamation suit is an attempt to create a chilling effect and keep other women from speaking up.”Throughout the arduous battle in court, where male lawyers would often snigger each time Ramani and Wahab took the stand to recount their trauma, the duo had senior advocate Rebecca John for company and courage.John, best known for representing DMK’s Kanimozhi in the 2G Spectrum case, described the Akbar-Ramani case as “probably the most important case of her life.”After fighting a powerful former minister, represented by a top legal firm and 99 lawyers, John said, “When you fight powerful people and you have only truth by your side, the journey becomes relevant to you personally. For two years I have watched Priya and her husband fly over to Delhi from Bengaluru to attend the hearings. Priya never once stepped back from truth. She never retracted. She defended it till the end.”John said the case was “very very difficult.”“You saw how difficult it was even inside the courtroom to get your word across. This case was challenging also in respect of the defences that were taken. These were defences people normally do not take. Probably this was the most important case of my life,” said John as the Indian #MeToo movement had its first Harvey Weinstein moment.Women across the media world cheered the verdict saying it would give them the confidence to call a spade a spade and demand safer workplaces.Ghazala Wahab whose testimony proved key in demolishing Akbar’s case, noted, “This is a day to remember that MeToo is not a movement. It is a consciousness about demanding and expecting safe workplaces, whether at home or outside. Women, who can, must always stand up for themselves and for those who are unable to stand for themselves, we have Priya Ramani.”After the verdict, #MeToo once again trended on Twitter after two years as women remembered how it started on October 8, 2018, when Ramani tweeted, “I began this piece with my MJ Akbar story; never named him because he did not do anything.”The tweet carried Ramani’s Vogue article about a sexual predator.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vindication-and-hope-ramanis-acquittal-blazes-a-trail-214216
18-02-2021||New Delhi||After Rajasthan, petrol crosses Rs 100 mark in Madhya Pradesh||After Rajasthan, petrol price on Thursday crossed the Rs 100 per litre mark in Madhya Pradesh after fuel rates were increased for the tenth day in a row.Petrol price was hiked by 34 paise per litre and diesel by 32 paise, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.While branded or additive-laced petrol, which attracts higher taxes, had crossed the Rs 100-mark in some places in states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, regular petrol crossed the physiological mark in Sriganganagar town of Rajasthan on Wednesday, and on Thursday it went past that mark in Madhya Pradesh.In Anuppur of Madhya Pradesh, petrol is priced at Rs 100.25 per litre and diesel at Rs 90.35.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. Rajasthan levies the highest value-added tax (VAT) on petrol in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh.Madhya Pradesh levies 33 per cent plus Rs 4.5 a litre and 1 per cent cess on petrol. On diesel, it charges 23 per cent plus Rs 3 per litre and 1 per cent cess.After Thursday’s price increase, petrol in Delhi costs Rs 89.88 per litre and diesel Rs 80.27.In Mumbai, petrol price rose to Rs 96.32 a litre and diesel was priced at Rs 87.32.Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had on Wednesday blamed output cut by oil-producing nations for the rally in international oil prices that have translated into higher retail rates in India.He urged Saudi Arabia and other global oil producers to ease production cuts, saying rising international oil prices are hurting economic recovery and demand.Demand recovery should take “primacy” over oil prices at least for the next few months, he had said.International oil prices have been on the boil since Saudi Arabia pledged additional voluntary output cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March under a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+.This has resulted in oil prices rising to USD 63 per barrel, the highest level in more than a year.“The rising crude oil prices during the last few weeks is hurting the fragile global economic recovery due to significant demand contraction, which might even mirror the impact of COVID-19 in its initial stages,” Pradhan had said at the 11th IEA IEF OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks.India, he said, had contained the inflationary pressures on several fronts but not those impacted by crude prices.“The price-sensitive Indian consumers are affected by rising petroleum product prices. It also affects demand growth, which could potentially impact the delicate aspirational economic growth trajectory not just in India but in other developing countries as well,” he said.Also, on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi blamed India’s over 85 per cent import dependence for the “burden” the common man was facing.In Sriganganagar, petrol price soared to Rs 100.49 a litre on Thursday.The record price in Rajasthan is despite the state government late last month cutting VAT on petrol and diesel by 2 per cent.VAT on petrol, after the cut, at 36 per cent plus Rs 1.5 per litre road cess is still the highest in the country. On diesel, the state levies 26 per cent and Rs 1.75 per litre road cess.Diesel in Sriganganagar is priced at 92.47 a litre.In 10 straight days, prices have gone up by Rs 2.93 per litre for petrol and Rs 3.14 per litre for diesel.The relentless hike in prices has been criticised by the opposition parties including the Congress, that has demanded an immediate cut in taxes to ease the burden on the common man.Pradhan last week had told Parliament that the government is not considering a reduction in excise duty to cool rates from their record highs.Central and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel.The Union Government levies Rs 32.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 a litre on diesel.Retail petrol rates have risen by Rs 20.29 per litre since mid-March 2020, after the government raised taxes by a record margin to mop up gains arising from fall in international oil prices. Diesel rates have gone up by Rs 17.98. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-rajasthan-petrol-crosses-rs-100-mark-in-madhya-pradesh-214206

The report said it could have been because of the tough stand taken by then CJI on the judicial and administrative sides.Justice Kaul said there was reason to believe that some judgments had led to a conspiracy being hatched against the then CJI.Justice Patnaik had inquired if decisions taken by then CJI on judicial side had triggered off the conspiracy against him.“Two years have passed and the possibility of recovery of electronic evidence now is unlikely. A three-member committee headed by CJI SA Bobde has already submitted a report. Suo motu case is closed and proceedings are disposed of. There is no requirement to keep the case going on," Justice Kaul noted.Referring to a letter written by Director of Intelligence Bureau that some conspiracy might have ensued due to the tough decisions, such as preparation of NRC in Assam, the Bench said, “There are strong reasons to believe that some kind of conspiracy may have been undertaken against the then CJI.”Advocate Utsav Bains, who had alleged that there was a conspiracy behind the allegations of sexual harassment, said, “It’s a vindication of my stand that there was a conspiracy against CJI Gogoi. I welcome the Supreme Court observation vindicating my stand that there was a conspiracy against CJI Gogoi.”The Supreme Court’s in-house inquiry – which probed the allegations of sexual harassment levelled by a dismissed woman employee against the then CJI – had in May 2019 given a clean chit to him, saying there was no substance in the allegations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-closes-suo-motu-proceedings-to-probe-conspiracy-to-frame-ex-cji-ranjan-gogoi-214196
18-02-2021||New Delhi||Companies in India likely to give 7.3 per cent average increment this year: Survey||Companies in India are expected to dole out an average increment of 7.3 per cent to employees this year amid faster-than-expected economic recovery and revival in business and consumer confidence, according to a survey.The first phase of the 2021 Workforce and Increment Trends Survey by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP (DTTILLP) also said the average increment this year would be higher than 4.4 per cent seen in 2020 but lower than 8.6 per cent given by companies in 2019.As many as 92 per cent companies that participated in the survey plan to give an increment in 2021 compared to only 60 per cent last year.The survey, launched in December 2020 as a B2B India-specific survey, covered around 400 organisations spread across seven sectors and 25 sub-sectors."Average increment for companies in India is expected to go up to 7.3 per cent from 4.4 per cent in 2020. This 7.3 per cent projected increment is lower than the 8.6 per cent average increment in 2019."The increase in increment budgets is in line with the faster-than-expected economic recovery, revival in business and consumer confidence, and early signs of improving corporate profitability," it said.As per the findings, 20 per cent companies plan to give a double-digit increment this year compared to only 12 per cent in 2020.Out of the 60 per cent companies that gave an increment in 2020, a third of them did that through off-cycle increments.Among the companies that did not give an increment in 2020, "only about 30 per cent plan to compensate employees for the previous year through higher increments and/or bonuses," it added.The survey further said the life sciences and information technology (IT) sectors are expected to give the highest increments whereas the manufacturing and services sectors continue to offer relatively lower salary increases."Life sciences is the only sector that will be able to match its 2019 increment levels. For others, average increment in 2021 is expected to be lower than 2019."Only digital and e-commerce companies are expected to offer double-digit average increments in 2021. Increments are likely to be the lowest in hospitality, real estate, infrastructure, and renewable energy companies," it added.Anandorup Ghose, partner at DTTILLP, said Covid has made year-on-year analysis tricky as 2020 has been an anomaly, making 2019 a better year for comparison.Average India 2021 increment of 7.3 per cent is still considerably lower than 8.6 per cent in 2019. While business activity is rebounding quickly, organisations are managing compensation budgets responsibly considering their affordability and sustainability of fixed cost increases, Ghose noted.According to him, post March 2020, most companies decided either not to offer increments or defer them until they get more clarity and around 25 per cent companies even extended a pay cut to their senior management."... at an all-India level, voluntary attrition reduced from 14.4 per cent in 2019 to 12.1 per cent in 2020, involuntary attrition (layoffs, restructuring, etc) increased from 3.1 per cent in 2019 to about 4 per cent in 2020. Involuntary attrition increased the most in the IT and services sectors, whereas voluntary attrition reduced across sectors," it added.Among priorities for 2021, most organisations identified greater adoption of technology in HR, employee wellness, and continued investment in learning and development as the top three focus areas.

But they should remember that the entire Congress party and I will stand as the voice of victims and will endeavour to get them justice,” she said in a tweet in Hindi  BSP chief Mayawati expressed condolences to the affected family, describing the incident as “very serious and sad”.“The BSP demands a high level inquiry into the incident and strict punishment for the culprits,” Mayawati tweeted.Samajwadi Party MLC Sunil Singh Sajan has alleged that the Unnao police was trying to hush up the case.

18-02-2021||Kolkata||Attack on Bengal minister a conspiracy, was being pressed to join another party: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee Thursday alleged the bomb attack on state minister Jakir Hossain was part of a conspiracy as certain people were “pressuring” him to switch over to another party.Banerjee, who went to the SSKM hospital to inquire after his condition following Wednesday’s incident, slammed the railways for its “lack lustre” way of functioning.“It was a preplanned attack on minister Jakir Hossain. Some people have claimed the blast was remote controlled. It is a conspiracy. Some people (party) were pressuring Jakir Hossian to join them for the last few months. I don’t want to disclose anything more as investigation is on,” Banerjee told reporters.The attackers apparently knew about Hossain’s movement and must have been tailing him, she said.Banerjee said not just the CID, but state STF and Counter Insurgency Force (CIF) will assist in the probe.The chief minister announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for those seriously injured in the explosion and Rs one lakh for people who received minor injuries.“How can the railways deny their responsibility over security lapses when the attack happened at a railway station? There were no security personnel at the station at the time of the attack. There was no light, it was completely dark. What was the railway police doing?” she asked.The railways should cooperate in the investigation, she said.“A railway station is a railway property. The railway police is in charge of its security. It is not under our jurisdiction,” she said.Banerjee said a total of 26 people were injured in the blast.The state government has handed over the probe in the case to the CID.Banerjee refuted the opposition claim of worsening law and order situation, saying the incident took place inside a railway station, premises that belong to the Centre.The BJP leadership, meanwhile, slammed Banerjee for trying to divert public attention from the failures of the state government.“The incident proves that law and order has ceased to exist. Does the railways run the state? Such theories won’t help. She has failed both as state home minister and the chief minister,” state BJP vice president Jaiprakash Majumdar said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/attack-on-bengal-minister-a-conspiracy-was-being-pressed-to-join-another-party-mamata-214187

India is a critical partner, especially when you consider all of the challenges in the Indo-Pacific region,” he said.“What I can tell you plainly is that the (Defence) Secretary is prioritising this relationship, wants to see it continue to grow and develop and to get stronger and he looks forward to working on initiatives to do just that,” Kirby added. In an op-ed in Newsweek this week, India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Sing Sandhu had said that the deepening defence and strategic partnership constituted an important area of cooperation, which rested on a strong institutional framework for defence collaboration and the shared strategic interests.“This will be particularly important in Asia where we will work bilaterally and with like-minded partners to pursue a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, while advancing the security and economic interests of countries with legitimate and vital interests in the region. And we will build on the deepening trade and investment linkages that create economic opportunities and jobs in both countries,” Sandhu wrote.

But after new amendments, the permission would be subject to reports submitted by district magistrates who will do antecedent checks. Also, eligibility will be fixed for CWC members.The most important amendment relates to the DM and ADM being allowed to issue adoption orders to fast track the process.Trade pact with Mauritius okayedThe government on Wednesday gave its nod to a proposal to sign a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement, which in a way could be termed as a free trade pact between India and Mauritius. The move is aims at liberalising norms to boost two-way trade and commerce. It will ensures that the trading partners cut or eliminate duties on a host of products, besides liberalising norms to promote trade in goods and services. — TNSFormer CEO of the Central Adoption Resource Agency Lt Col Deepak Kumar, who was involved in drafting the amendments, said: “At present, the family court, district court or a city civil court is competent to pass the adoption order under Section 61 of the Act.

The high-powered committee is monitoring the project.Venugopal said Chopra had on his own written the letter to the government linking the broadening of the road to the recent flash floods on Dhauliganga river, which damaged Tapovan hydro project.“You file a response to it,” the Bench told the Attorney General and posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.The top court had on January 18 asked the parties to file their objections, if any, on the report filed by the high-powered committee.The Centre wanted the court to accept the majority report of 21-members of the high-powered committee submitted on December 31 last year recommending the road to be developed to be two-lane with paved shoulders (10 m wide carriageway) considering the strategic requirement and snow removal needs.It said three members, including chairman Ravi Chopra (minority report), were still impressing upon the width of 5.5 m as provided under the earlier circular dated March 23, 2018, issued by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, notwithstanding the security needs of the country and the need of the defence forces to resist external aggression, if any, as the Indo-China border.It said the majority report had taken a holistic view of the matter keeping in mind the social, economic and strategic needs of the country and protecting the environment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-uttarakhand-disaster-not-due-to-char-dham-project-214040

Probably the most important case of my life. — Rebecca John, Priya Ramani’s lawyerRamani had made allegations of sexual misconduct against Akbar in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2018. Akbar filed a case against her on October 15, 2018, for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct decades ago.Vindication and hope was the sum of all reactions to the historic judgment. As Akbar’s claim of “damage to stellar reputation” crumbled under the weight of Ramani and journalist Ghazala Wahab’s shocking accounts of sexual and psychological assault at the hands of the former editor of Asian Age, a sense of victory pervaded every heart that stood in solidarity with the duo.“I feel vindicated and hope this verdict would help more and more women speak up besides discouraging men in positions of power from filing false cases against those who share their truth,” said a beaming Ramani, who would leave her 10-year-old daughter in Bengaluru to attend 53 hearings in Delhi for more than 28 months.Her lawyer Rebecca John, best known for representing DMK’s Kanimozhi in the 2G spectrum case, described the Akbar-Ramani case as “probably the most important case” of her life. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ramani-let-off-court-junks-mj-akbars-suit-214038

18-02-2021||United Nations||India announces gift of 200,000 COVID-19 doses for UN peacekeepers||India, hailed as the pharmacy of the world, on Wednesday announced a gift of 200,000 COVID-19 doses for UN peacekeepers.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar made the announcement at the UN Security Council open debate on the implementation of resolution 2532 (2020) on the cessation of hostilities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.“Keeping in mind the UN Peacekeepers who operate in such difficult circumstances, we would like to announce today a gift of 200,000 doses for them,” Jaishankar told the UN Security Council in a virtual address.Quoting the Bhagvad Gita, Jaishankar said, “Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind.”He told the meeting that it is this spirit in which India approaches the COVID challenge and urged the Council to work collectively to address its different dimensions.Jaishankar said India is working actively with GAVI, World Health Organisation and ACT Accelerator and its contribution has also supported the SAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund.Shortly after the announcement, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti tweeted, “Protecting the Protectors! External Affairs Minister @DrSJaishankar announces a gift of 200,000 doses of vaccines for UN peacekeepers at #UNSC. India responds immediately to request of @UN Secretary General @antonioguterres.”Jaishankar told the Council that India, the pharmacy of the world, has been very much at the forefront of the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. India earlier provided critical medicines, diagnostic kits, ventilators and PPEs to more than 150 countries, about 80 of them on a grant basis.“Today, the pharmacy of the world is stepping forward to meet the global vaccines challenge,” he said, adding that two vaccines, including one indigenously developed, have already been granted emergency authorisation. Additionally, as many as 30 candidates are under various stages of development.Under India’s initiative of “Vaccine Maitri”, which translates into Vaccine Friendship, the country is providing vaccines to the world and is a significant source of supply to the COVAX facility.In addition, India is also directly sending vaccines to friends and partners. “Starting with our immediate neighbours, 25 nations across the world have already received Made in India vaccines. 49 more countries will be supplied in the coming days, ranging from Europe, North America, Latin America and the Caribbean to Africa, South-East Asia and the Pacific Islands,” he said.In one of the largest vaccination drives ever, India will vaccinate about 300 million frontline and healthcare workers, elderly and vulnerable over the next six months. “Our vaccination programme, which began a month ago, has already seen nearly 7 million people vaccinated,” Jaishankar said.Earlier this week, two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine were given WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL). The versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, produced by AstraZeneca-SK Bioscience (AZ-SKBio) and the Serum Institute of India (AZ-SII), are now available for global rollout through the COVAX Facility.Last month, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the vaccine production capacity of India is “one of the best assets the world has today”, and had applauded India for supplying COVID-19 vaccines to nations around the world.India has already rolled out a massive coronavirus vaccination drive under which two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, are being administered to frontline health workers across the country.India had airlifted more than 6 million COVID-19 doses to nine countries in Phase-I under “Vaccine Maitri”. Contractual supplies to various countries are also being undertaken in a phased manner and New Delhi has said it will gradually supply to the COVAX facility of the World Health Organisation.

18-02-2021||---||No data on efficacy of India’s COVID vaccines against South African, Brazilian variants: Scientists||New Delhi, February 17Preliminary research shows the two vaccines against COVID-19 approved in India are effective against the UK variant of the novel coronavirus, but there is no data on their efficacy against the South African and Brazilian mutants detected in the country.On Tuesday, the Health ministry said four people were detected with the South Africa variant of SARS-CoV-2 and one tested positive for the Brazil variant, a first for India, prompting scientists to stress the need for more data and studies so the country’s vaccine programme can be tailored to evolving exigencies.The number of people who have tested positive for the UK variant in the country has climbed to 187, officials added.The vaccines currently approved for emergency use in India are Covishield, from the Oxford-AstraZeneca stable manufactured by Pune’s Serum Institute of India, and Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the National Institute of Virology (NIV).Answering the question uppermost in many minds, researcher Deepak Sehgal said it is difficult to say how effective the two will be against the new emerging variants, particularly the South African and Brazilian ones, unless scientists have studied them properly.“Having said that, among the two vaccines currently in India, Covaxin may do better against the new mutants because it generates protection against the whole virus. The Covishield vaccine is targeted at only one protein of the virus,” Sehgal, head of the department of Life Sciences, Shiv Nadar University, Uttar Pradesh, told PTI.Covaxin, he explained, can produce antibodies against many epitopes, or many regions of the complete virus, while Covishield produces antibodies against only a specific region of the virus.“So even if there is a mutation in one region, there are antibodies being produced against other regions of the virus which will be effective in case of Covaxin,” he added.Covaxin is an “inactivated” vaccine developed by chemically treating novel coronavirus samples to make them incapable of reproduction. This process leaves the viral proteins, including the spike protein of the coronavirus which it uses to enter the human cells, intact.Covishield contains an engineered version of adenoviruses that infect chimpanzees to carry the gene responsible for the spike protein of the novel coronavirus.Adenoviruses are common viruses that typically cause mild cold or flu-like illnesses.Both the vaccines claim to have some efficacy against the UK variant.According to a yet-to-be published study on 26 participants, Covaxin was found to be effective against the UK variant, Bharat Biotech said in late January.Similarly, a study by Oxford University found that the ChAdOx1-nCoV19 vaccine, known as Covishield in India, was effective in tackling the UK variant.Immunologist Vineeta Bal noted that the UK variant had only one mutation that mattered and hence these results were not surprising.“While Bharat Biotech results were on a small number of samples to check inhibition against UK virus in the present evolving situation, this can be taken as adequate preliminary data,” Bal, from Pune’s Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), said.However, both the South African and Brazilian variants have many more mutations and hence significant decrease in efficacy may be seen, she said.“We do not have an answer for the efficacy against the new variants yet. I am sure efforts are on to test sera (blood) from vaccinated individuals for their ability to block the growth of new variants in the tissue culture system,” Bal told PTI.“For that the variant virus has to be available and also the testing facility. NIV, for example, has competence to do it, and I am sure they are attempting to test,” she said, adding that no results are available in the public domain yet.Globally, 10 COVID-19 vaccines have been either approved by several countries or are under limited emergency use.New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the one that started the pandemic.UK government scientific advisers say the COVID-19 variant now predominant in the country may be 30-70 per cent more “deadly” than previous variants, underscoring concerns about how mutations may change the characteristics of the disease.A recent study suggests the vaccine co-developed by the American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and the German biotechnology company BioNTech can neutralise variants of the novel coronavirus that were first reported in the UK and South Africa.The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, noted that the vaccine is effective against coronavirus variants carrying the N501Y and E484K mutations.In January, US biotechnology firm Moderna said lab studies showed its COVID-19 vaccine would remain protective against variants of the coronavirus first identified in the UK and South Africa.However, out of caution, the company will test adding a second booster of its vaccine—to make three shots in total—and has begun preclinical studies on a booster specifically for the South African variant.In the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the messenger RNA—or mRNA—acts as a blueprint for the production of the coronavirus spike protein and is encapsulated by lipid molecules and delivered into human cells mRNAs contain a blueprint for producing proteins in cells. Based on the reports rather than solid published data, it appears that rapid spread of these emerging variants would pose some risk to individuals who have recovered from earlier infection as well as those already vaccinated, Bal said.“In India we do not know how effectively testing, screening and quarantine is implemented for contacts and cases.“Depending upon that, spread can be curtailed with varying efficiency and hopefully serious spread will not happen and another round of lockdown will not be needed,” she added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-data-on-efficacy-of-indias-covid-vaccines-against-south-african-brazilian-variants-scientists-213758

18-02-2021||Mumbai||Events at border illustrative of confident India: PM Modi||India is brimming with confidence, and the events on the borders and the government’s decision to liberalise geospatial data are representative of the same, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday.Modi said in the past, security considerations were the biggest “red light” which prevented the government from undertaking the measure to liberalise map making and access to geospatial data.In the remarks, which come amid a slew of reports suggesting a disengagement between Indian and Chinese forces in icy heights of eastern Ladakh, Modi said the confidence is a very big asset.“Today, India is brimming with confidence. We are seeing it on the borders,” he said, without explicitly mentioning the thaw with China after nearly 10 months of a standoff.It can be noted that there was a heavy troop and military hardware build-up in the Himalayan region since last summer, after China moved troops to newer grounds amid the pandemic.One of the many confrontations turned ugly leading to deaths of soldiers in fist-fights and warning shots were also fired in another instance. The troops continued to be on vigil braving the hostile winter and according to reports, there has been a “disengagement” on the banks of Pangong Tso and south of it.Addressing the annual Nasscom Technology and Leadership Forum organised by the IT industry lobby grouping, Modi said the decision to liberalise the geospatial data and map making is not just restricted to the area of technology, nor should it be seen as another administrative reform where the government exits a particular field.“This decision is illustrative of India’s capabilities. India is confident that even after this decision, we can ensure our security and also give an opportunity for the country’s young population to excel at the world stage,” Modi said.He said the decision will strengthen the technology startup ecosystem and ensure that it can “endure”. It will help the IT sector and also strengthens the wider Aatmanirbhar Bharat mission focused on self-reliance, the PM said.He also acknowledged that many tech industry representatives and entrepreneurs had been pitching for the de-regulation in this and citing issues with red tape for long, but pointed out that the “red light” of security prevented movement on the same.“Our young entrepreneurs need full freedom to take advantage of the opportunities made available at the world stage. It is precisely this thinking which has led to this decision,” he said, adding that the government has full faith in the citizens, startups and innovators which has led it to promote self-certification.In his address, the PM urged startup founders to think on how they can create institutions which can outlive this century, rather than focusing on valuations or exit strategies.He said there is a need to create world class products that will set the global benchmark of excellence, and pointed out that the domestic market of over 130 crore people is the biggest asset for the companies.He exhorted the IT industry to focus its corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts to develop lateral thinking in rural kids and added that the changes it will bring about can prove to be a “gamechanger” for India.The Prime Minister said the country is not short of ideas, but needs mentors to help turn ideas into reality in its path of progress.Modi said he will personally ensure that the targets on optical fibre cable laying will be met, but urged the IT industry to develop solutions for societal good which leverage on the wide network.Modi lauded the IT industry for its work during the pandemic and also for ensuring that it has grown by over 2 per cent to USD 194 billion in FY21.“When the chips were down, the Indian IT industry’s code kept things running. It has done wonders during the pandemic,” the PM said.He said in the past, the Indian IT industry could not take advantage of a lot many aspects because of the regulations and the digital divide kept widening as a result of it.Acknowledging that leaders of tomorrow cannot flourish under restrictions, Modi said the National Digital Communication Policy is an attempt to make India into a global digital product hub.Appreciating the work done by fintech companies, he said the JAM (Jandhan, Aadhar and Mobile) trinity has ensured a shifted from being a cash economy to a less cash economy and added that digital technologies has reduced black money problems.The technological interventions are helping us deliver on the promise of minimum government and maximum governance, he said, and also added that the world is now looking at India with a lot of hope and confidence levels which are higher.
