We have a ministry of fisheries (@FisheriesGoI ) but Rahul Gandhi doesn't know what is in India.@priyankagandhi :Govt. didn't repay the UP sugarcane farmer. Brother and Sister don't know the facts.  Singh said that he was willing to inform Gandhi of the Fisheries Ministry's work across the country, including in Puducherry.The BJP leader also posted a tweet in Italian that said there was no separate ministry of fisheries in Italy and that it comes under agriculture and forestry ministry, an apparent reference to the Italian origin of Rahul Gandhi's mother and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.श्री @RahulGandhi जी..ये मिनिस्ट्री है 👉🏻 @FisheriesGoI ये मिनिस्टर हैं 👉🏻 @girirajsinghbjp और ये फिर एक बार,झूठ की राजनीति के चक्कर में,@INCIndia ‘पार्टी’ की किरकिरी हो रही है 👇🏼 pic.twitter.com/s079SoP9Kf  In a jibe, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar tweeted, "HumDo (the duo) of the Congress.

This is my first visit I’ve made outside India in the New Year. I am travelling in these COVID times gives an indication of the importance we attach to our relations with Russia”.“I am sure it will be a very-very fruitful and productive discussion,” the foreign secretary said on his two-day official visit.He said he would also meet academics, media personnel and experience the Russian culture.“On the whole I think, we are on our way to see how we can add momentum to an already vibrant relationship, a very strong India-Russia special and privileged strategic partnership. Thank you. Spasibo vam (Thank you in Russian),” Shringla said.In New Delhi on Monday, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said this year’s first visit abroad by the foreign secretary to Moscow, at the invitation of Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Morgulov, signifies the importance India attaches to its close and friendly relations with Russia.“The foreign secretary will hold the next round of India-Russia foreign office consultations with Deputy Foreign Minister Morgulov, during which the two sides will review the entire gamut of bilateral relations, including the forthcoming high-level exchanges,” it said.The MEA said both sides will also exchange views on topical issues of regional and international importance.“Despite the COVID-19 pandemic situation, India and Russia have sustained the momentum of the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between the two countries,” the MEA added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/foreign-secretary-shringla-holds-fruitful-and-productive-meetings-with-top-russian-diplomats-213795
17-02-2021||New Delhi||Centre denies Char Dham Project has anything to do with disaster in Rishi Ganga valley||The Centre on Wednesday has denied before the Supreme Court that Char Dham, the road widening project, has anything to do with the Rishi Ganga valley disaster in Uttarakhand, in which dozens of people lost their lives, and went missing. Attorney General KK Venugopal told a Bench headed Justice RF Nariman that the Centre would like to respond to a letter written by Ravi Chopra—chairman of a high-powered committee—in which several ‘allegations’ have been made with regard to broadening of road and the recent disaster in Uttarakhand.The strategic 900-km Rs 12,000 crore Char Dham highway project aims to provide all-weather connectivity to four holy towns—Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath—in Uttarakhand up to India-China border. The high-powered committee is monitoring the project.Venugopal said Chopra has on his own written the letter to the government linking the broadening of the road to the recent flash floods on Dhauliganga River which damaged Tapovan hydro project.“You file a response to it,” the Bench told the Attorney General, and posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.The top court had on January 18 asked the parties to file their objections, if any, on the report filed by the high-powered committee.The Centre wanted the court to accept the majority report of 21-members of the high-powered committee submitted on December 31 last year recommending the road to be developed to be two-lane with paved shoulders (10 metre wide carriageways) considering the strategic requirement and snow removal needs.It said that three members, including the chairman Ravi Chopra (minority report) were impressed upon the width of 5.5 metres as provided under the earlier circular dated March 23, 2018 issued by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), notwithstanding the security needs of the country and the need of the defence forces to resist external aggression, if any, as the Indo-China border.It said the majority report has taken a holistic view of the matter keeping in mind the social, economic and strategic needs of the country and protecting the environment.Earlier, the Ministry of Defence has sought modification of the top court’s September 8, last year order which asked the MoRTH to follow the 2018 circular stipulating carriageway width of 5.5 metre, citing the prevailing situation on Indo-China border points.In August, 2019, the top court had cleared the Chardham highway project by modifying a National Green Tribunal order to constitute a high-powered committee to look into environmental concerns.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-denies-char-dham-project-has-anything-to-do-with-disaster-in-rishi-ganga-valley-213782
17-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||Amid spate of ‘mahapanchayats’, BJP’s worries grow in Jat-dominated areas of northwest||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 17Amid the spate of ‘mahapanchayats’, BJP’s worries appear to be growing over its prospects in the Jat-dominated agrarian lands of north-west India. The “support” to farmers’ agitation from “non-Jats and Muslims” is also threatening to upset the saffron-party’s carefully crafted equations on the back of which it has been winning elections, especially in Uttar Pradesh which is due for polls in 2022.Though the leadership has tried to give the farmers’ agitation against the three contentious agriculture laws “a two-and-half-state” angle, but the stir making international headlines has led it to discuss and devise a strategy to blunt the feeling of “alienation” among the community. This appeared to be the main theme of the meeting called by the BJP president JP Nadda on Tuesday, a day before the party took a beating in civic body elections in Punjab.The meeting was attended by Home Minister Amit Shah, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and leaders from Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh – the states leading the stir along with Punjab – including the Muzzafarnagar MP Sanjeev Balyan, who belongs to the same ‘Balyan khap’ as BKU leader Rakesh TikaitNotably, the growing influence of Rakesh Tikait – who has emerged as a symbol of Jat unity in these ‘khap mahapanchayats’ – in western UP, and now also in parts of Haryana and Rajasthan, influenced by the community and support of non-Jats (including Dalits) and Muslims to what was being considered a predominantly Jat-driven agitation, is a matter of concern for the BJP.After the 2013 Muzzafarnagar riots, the Western UP region witnessed a deep polarisation with Hindu Jats, non-Jats and Dalits gravitating towards the BJP.The saffron party has been sweeping the Western UP and Jat-dominated regions on the back of this consolidation. However, the emergence of Tikait as the new binding force at these ‘mahapanchayats’ and the support from non-farming castes and Muslims to the farmers’ agitation has the potential to upset the carefully nurtured vote bank that won it Lok Sabha and Assembly seats, say observers.Leaders of opposition parties in UP, like the Samajwadi Party and the RLD, are already wooing these sections, building a narrative around "protecting village economy from pro-corporate policy of BJP governments”.Sources say the BJP is planning a mega reach-out to the community to blunt the growing perception against the party. Top leaders will pitch in this campaign to “dispel politically-driven  misconceptions against the farm laws and the party", they said.A section in the party also agrees that ‘mahapanchayats’ in Haryana, western UP and parts of Rajasthan are a cause of concern for the party.The government wants to resolve the issue and “our doors are always open for farmers”, they said, adding that leaders from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan have been asked to reach out to people at the 'panchayat' level (khaps) and ensure that communities, especially Jats,  do not feel alienated from the BJP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-spate-of-mahapanchayats-bjps-worries-grow-in-jat-dominated-areas-of-northwest-213781
17-02-2021||New Delhi||Farmers at Singhu gear up to beat summer heat and continue protest||Farmers sitting on protest against the Government’s new farms laws have started preparing to face the scorching summer heat at Singhu village.They are planning to install fans, coolers, generators at the protest site.There are two stages set up at the Singhu protest site—one stage facing toward Delhi where the protesting farmers can be seen sitting at an open space, while the second stage is near Kundli village (border area of Delhi and Haryana), which is fully covered with tarpaulin.The farmers leaders told IANS that various social organisations have come forward to provide fans and coolers to the protesting farmers.“We are preparing to replace these tarpaulin-made tents under which farmers have been sitting for over 80 days braving chilly winds so far. With the summer having started and with every passing day becoming hotter, we are planning to install fans and coolers and if need be, air conditioners will also be provided. The changes would happen in the next couple of days,” said Kulveer Singh, a resident of Hoshiarpur district in Punjab, who is also a member of the Krantikari Kisan Union.He said that volunteers have started preparing for initiating the changes at the protest sites.“Two such setups have already come up behind both the stages. We are not only planning to beat the summer heat, but we will also ensure that farmers get chilled potable water in the coming days.”Apart from tarpaulin shades or plastic tents, most of the farmers stay in their tractor-trolleys they have brought from their villages. All the tractor-trolleys parked across the road or outside (Delhi-Chandigarh highway) could be seen covered with tarpaulin.Many tractor-trolleys that have carried farmers from different villages and districts from Haryana and Punjab are fitted with fans to provide cool air to the farmers. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-at-singhu-gear-up-to-beat-summer-heat-and-continue-protest-213771
17-02-2021||New Delhi||Cabinet nod to juvenile justice law amendments||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015, increasing the role of district magistrates and additional district magistrates.Addressing the media on the Cabinet decision, Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani said in every district, the District Magistrate and the Additional District Magistrate would get the power to monitor functions of agencies responsible for the implementation of the  Act.The district child protection unit will also function under the district magistrate, she said.Irani said till now there was no specific direction to carry out a background check of people who are to become members of the child welfare committees (CWC).According to the amendments cleared by the Cabinet, before becoming a member of the CWC, background and educational qualification checks will be included, she noted.Irani said earlier any organisation which wanted to run a child care institution would need to give its purpose to the state government.In the proposed amendments, before registration of a CCI, the DM will conduct its capacity and background check and then submit the recommendations to the state government, she said.The DM can independently evaluate a specialised CWC, juvenile police unit and registered institutions.The scope of the Juvenile Justice Act has been expanded.Child victims of trafficking and drug abuse and those abandoned by their guardians will be included in the definition of "child in need of care" and protection, she said.At present, the Act has three categories of petty, serious and heinous crimes."One more category will be included…offences where the sentence is more than seven years but no minimum sentence is prescribed or a minimum sentence of less than seven years is provided shall be treated as serious offences under the Act," she said.

17-02-2021||Puducherry||‘I forgive,’ says Rahul Gandhi on his father Rajiv’s killers||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said the killing of his father Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 brought him tremendous pain but he nursed no anger or hatred towards those responsible for it.During an interaction the Congress MP had with students of a state-run women’s college here, a pupil posed, “Your father was killed by the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) what are your feelings about these people?” and he answered by saying violence cannot take away anything.“I don’t have anger or hatred towards anybody. Of course, I lost my father and for me it was a very difficult time,” he said, adding, it was similar to having one’s heart severed.“I felt tremendous pain, but I don’t feel anger, I don’t feel any hatred or any anger. I forgive,” he said to rounds of applause.To the next question, he said “violence cannot take away anything from you... my father is alive in me...my father is talking through me.”Gandhi interacted with students of Bharathidasan Government College for Women following a dialogue with people from the fishermen community.Though most parties supported the release of seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) had opposed it.Rajiv Gandhi was killed on May 21, 1991 by a woman suicide bomber at Sriperumbudur near Chennai in a poll rally.TNCC chief K S Alagiri had said a few months ago that if the Rajiv case convicts were to be set free, a demand would arise for the release of all “murder convicts” who had spent over 25 years in prison.“If the court announces the release of seven Rajiv case convicts, we will accept it. However, political parties rooting for their release is unacceptable,” Alagiri had said.The Tamil Nadu government had in 2018 recommended to Governor Banwarilal Purohit to release them.

17-02-2021||New Delhi||'Rail roko': Railways deploys 20 additional RPSF companies, focus on Punjab, Haryana, UP||The railways has deployed 20 additional companies of the RPSF across the country, with focus on Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, in the wake of the “rail roko” called on Thursday by farmer groups protesting against the Centre’s new agri laws.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of protesting farmer unions which is spearheading the protest, last week had announced the rail blockade to press for its demand to repeal the legislations.Director General, Railway Protection Force, Arun Kumar on Wednesday said, “I appeal to everyone to maintain peace. We will be liaisoning with district administrations and will have a control room in place.”“We will gather intelligence. States such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, and some other areas will be our focus. We have deployed 20 companies (around 20,000 personnel) of the Railway Protection Special Force (RPSF) in these areas,” he said.“We want to persuade them to not cause inconvenience for passengers. We have a four-hour window and we want it (rail roko) to get over peacefully,” Kumar said.The SKM had said the rail blockade will held across the country from 12 pm to 4 pm.The announcement came amid the ongoing protests against the laws at Delhi’s borders by farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and ‘mahapanchayats’ that are being organised in these states to garner support for the movement.On Tuesday, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni had said farmer unions will hold meetings in poll-bound West Bengal as well and indicated that they will ask people there not to vote for those who are “snatching our livelihood”.Farmers are protesting against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.

We will hold panchayats in the entire country and make people aware and associate them with us,” he said, a day ahead of a “rail roko” announced by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions which is spearheading the protest.Chaduni alleged that the entire agri business was being given to corporates and said the farmers’ movement was for their “survival”.“Agriculture is our livelihood and not our business. The food grains of the country will go into godowns of corporates and they will indulge in black marketing. This is an ‘andolan’ (movement) not only of farmers but of all,” he said.Farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The three farm laws, enacted in September last year, have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-will-not-return-home-till-they-win-bku-leader-gurnam-singh-chaduni-213750
17-02-2021||New Delhi||IIT Guwahati researchers develop advanced techniques for rapid evaporation of droplets||Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Guwahati have developed a novel method for rapid evaporation of droplets.According to the team, the method is aimed at controlling the life-time of droplets containing suspended nanoparticles. Suspended nanoparticles are magnetically active, thereby enabling the flexibility of being under control in a magnetic forcing environment.The research has been published in “Soft Matter”, a highly reputed journal belonging to the Royal Society of Chemistry.“The research revealed that the mixing between two droplets can be attenuated significantly under the actuation of the magnetic field. This novel method showed a significant enhancement of around 80 per cent in the overall mixing time between the droplets in comparison to the case where no external force is applied,” said Pranab Kumar Mondal, Assistant Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati.“The research outcomes could be potentially beneficial in the area of biomedical diagnostics, whereby rapid and efficient mixing between fluids is of utmost importance.In addition to that, this research also revealed that the magnetic field can be successfully used in altering the lifetime of a droplet containing suspended magnetic nanoparticles,” he said.According to the team, the research has shown that the evaporation rate of the droplet can be successfully controlled by varying the applied magnetic field frequency.“The inferences drawn from this study could have far-reaching implications ranging from biomedical engineering to surface patterning.“With the advent of miniaturization, effective transfer of mass between species has attracted significant attention of global communities because of its wide range of industrial applicability. In particular, rapid evaporation and mixing between droplets has an extensive range of engineering applications such as biological sample diagnostics, ink-jet printing, surface patterning and many more,” Mondal said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iit-guwahati-researchers-develop-advanced-techniques-for-rapid-evaporation-of-droplets-213749

We’ll enquire & accordingly take needful action (sic),” reads the message texted to PTI by Ramaswami.On Tuesday, the Bombay High Court granted transit anticipatory bail to Shantanu Muluk for 10 days.Shivlal Muluk (54) made the representation as a “responsible citizen” to Beed Police and urged the SP to take appropriate action regarding the ‘search’ conducted at his house, an official said.The letter stated that two persons visited the residence of the Muluks in Chanakyapuri area in Beed on February 12 around 5.30 am and introduced themselves as officials of the Delhi Police by showing their identity cards, the official said.The duo told the Muluk family that Delhi Police wanted to know about Shantanu, saying he had committed treason and he had been in contact with pro-Khalistan people, the official said quoting the letter.The duo then searched all rooms in the house and took away a hard disk, an environment-related poster, a book and a mobile phone cover from Shantanu Muluk’s room, it stated.According to Shivlal Muluk, the police officials did not show any search warrant and also didn’t obtain any permission from the family before taking away these items, the letter said.The police officials also didn’t prepare any ‘panchnama’ of the seized material, it stated.A Panchnama is a record of witness testimony, usually prepared by the police, during the investigation of a crime or after a death.The police officials also told the Muluk family that the seized material would be returned to them later, as per the representation.Shivlal Muluk also claimed that the visiting police team had asked him to come to the government guest house in Beed for questioning.The letter stated that Shivlal Muluk as a “responsible citizen” was informing about the visit of the Delhi Police to Beed SP as no local government official accompanied them.When contacted on phone, Shivlal Muluk said on Wednesday that he was not in a condition to speak.According to the Delhi police, Shantanu Muluk and Mumbai-based lawyer Nikita Jacob, along with arrested accused Disha Ravi were allegedly involved in preparing the document and were in direct touch with “pro-Khalistani elements”.On Wednesday, the Bombay HC also granted transit anticipatory bail to Jacob.The Delhi police on Monday alleged that Ravi, along with Jacob and Shantanu, had created the toolkit and shared it with others to tarnish India’s image.Greta Thunberg, a celebrated climate activist, had shared the “toolkit” to lend support to the farmers’ agitation near Delhi borders against the Union government’s new agri laws.

I wanted to reach the spot and meet the bereaved families on Tuesday but it could have affected the rescue operation,” Chouhan told reporters in Bhopal before leaving for Sidhi.The Chief Minister said he would meet family members of the deceased and console them.The accident took place on Tuesday morning near Patna village, around 80 km from the Sidhi district headquarters, when the bus heading from Sidhi to Satna fell into the canal, which is part of the Bansagar dam project.Nearly 600 personnel, including from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and local authorities, from five districts are engaged in the rescue operation since Tuesday morning, officials said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday expressed grief at the ‘horrific’ bus accident and approved an ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh each for the next of kin of those who lost their lives.Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced a separate ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh each to the kin of the deceased.Chouhan on Tuesday said he ordered to stop the water outflow from the Bansagar dam so that water level in the canal could go down and help in the rescue operation.

17-02-2021||United Nations||India at UN says it fully supports Iraq’s request for UN observation of polls||India has strongly backed Iraq’s request for the UN observation of parliamentary elections in the country in October, saying it endorses any process that respects the Gulf nation’s sovereignty and strengthens the democratic exercise.India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti, speaking at the UN Security Council Briefing on ‘The Situation in Iraq’ on Tuesday, said that the parliamentary elections in Iraq in October 2021 will be a “valuable” opportunity to strengthen the roots of democracy in the country.“A transparent, free, fair and inclusive election, conducted in a violence-free environment with high voter turnout, will empower the new government to implement reforms, improve accountability, meet the genuine aspirations of Iraqi people, especially the women and youth, and promote inclusiveness and reconciliation,” he said.Tirumurti said that international assistance to the Independent High Electoral Commission of Iraq and UN observation of the electoral process would enhance the credibility of these elections and build confidence about the integrity of the results amongst the Iraqi people.“In this regard, India fully supports the government of Iraq’s request for UN observation of the upcoming elections in the country. We will support any process which respects Iraq’s sovereignty, strengthens the democratic exercise, and makes it credible, and consequently acceptable to the people of Iraq,” he said, adding that in line with its own strong democratic traditions, India has contributed to the democratic and electoral processes in Iraq by training Independent High Electoral Commission officials and sending election observers.The Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Iraq and head of United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert told the Council that for credible elections to take place in Iraq, it is imperative that parties and candidates operate in a free and safe environment.She called on all parties, stakeholders and authorities to come together, to agree on a ‘code of conduct’ and to allow all Iraqi candidates to operate freely—irrespective of ethnicity, gender, language, religion, belief or background.Hennis-Plasschaert pointed out that a request from the Iraqi government for electoral observation is currently before the Security Council.“As I address this Council, I also would like to underline that, no matter what your response is, the elections will be Iraqi-led and Iraqi-owned at all times. And I sincerely hope that all of Iraq’s political leadership truly takes this to heart. Equally important, yet not always fully understood: the UN does not take sides. Our independence and impartiality define us,” she said.Tirumurti noted the “positive” progress in preparation for the upcoming elections and said the passage of the electoral law and allocation of funds to the Independent High Electoral Commission are significant steps.He said it is important that the remaining conditions for smooth elections like completion of biometric voter registration and agreement on the Federal Supreme Court’s membership are also fulfilled in a timely manner.As Tirumurti expressed condolences for those killed in the January 21 terrorist attacks in Baghdad, he said the international community must continue its support for Iraqi Security Forces and the government so that they can credibly address the menace of terrorism and provide an environment free of terror and fear.Referring to the report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team of the 1267 Committee, which said that majority of the active 10,000 ISIS fighters in the region are in Iraq, Tirumurti voiced concern over the situation and said focus of the Security Council should be to eliminate every threat posed by the ISIS and other terror groups in Iraq and elsewhere in the world.He said the continued attacks on diplomatic establishments and convoys, including the one in Erbil by non-state armed groups are a “serious challenge” in maintaining the fragile peace that prevails in Iraq.While appreciating efforts by the government to provide protection to all diplomatic missions, Tirumurti expressed hope that a long-term solution can be found to this issue.Further, India commended concerted efforts of the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Regional Government to resolve all outstanding issues, and encouraged both sides to continue the “constructive dialogue for a mutually satisfactory long-term sustainable agreement on these issues, including on revenue sharing and budget allocations.”        Applauding the Iraqi government’s determined efforts to maintain friendly and cordial ties with its neighbours and other regional countries, the Indian envoy emphasised that the stability of Iraq should be of paramount importance to the region.“The country should not become a theatre for regional or global conflicts,” he said, reaffirming India’s steadfast support for Iraq’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.Tirumurti told the Council that India is the preferred destination for medical treatment for many Iraqi friends and this cooperation has continued during the COVID-19 pandemic.Under the ‘Air Bubble Arrangement’ between the countries, over 10,000 Iraqi nationals have travelled to India during the last four months alone for medical treatment.

17-02-2021||New York||Time to renew ‘unique’ India-US partnership that can benefit a fifth of humanity: Amb Sandhu||As the world confronts the COVID-19 pandemic and an economic slowdown, it is time to renew the promise of a “unique partnership” between India and America that can directly benefit a fifth of humanity, India’s ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu has said.In an opinion piece titled ‘Meeting the Challenge of our Times: Deepening the India-US Partnership’ in American news outlet Newsweek, Sandhu outlines five key areas of cooperation between New Delhi and Washington that will benefit not just the two democracies but also help usher a safer, healthier and more prosperous world.These areas are fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, combating climate change, digital capabilities, education partnership and deepening defence and strategic partnership.“As the world comes to terms with its biggest disruption in more than half a century, it is time to renew the promise of a unique partnership that can directly benefit a fifth of humanity, and can be a source of durable peace and security for the rule-based world order,” Sandhu writes.While the two countries have forged a “remarkable partnership” over the last two decades built on a bipartisan consensus in the US and cross-party support in India, Sandhu said under the new US administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, “we can build on that foundation to benefit our nations and the world”.“Our immediate work with the US administration will focus on confronting the pandemic, advancing our wide-ranging cooperation in health care, which ranges from scientific exchanges (five vaccine collaborations are currently underway) to pharmaceutical inputs and exchange of best practices,” he said.India, the “pharmacy of the world”, has shipped COVID-19 vaccines to its neighbours in South Asia as well as to other partners, including in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia, he said.Sandhu says the US has resources and scientific capabilities that make it a “natural, complementary” partner in supporting a number of other countries seeking to fight the pandemic.“Furthermore, from the provision of active pharmaceutical ingredients to generic medicines that have lowered drug prices and created jobs and investments, India has demonstrated its reliability as a supply chain partner, especially as de-risking from single country supplies has become a priority,” the Indian ambassador said.The shared concern between the two countries in creating a healthier world goes hand-in-hand with combating climate change, which Sandhu listed as the second area of cooperation.Underscoring that India remains committed to the goals of the Paris Climate Accord, Sandhu welcomed the return of the US to this important agreement.Noting that the two countries already worked together in renewable energy under the Strategic Energy Partnership, he said: “we can build on these gains and accelerate a green transformation through effective technology transfers, financing and an equity-based approach that will increase access to renewable energy for a wider population, which in turn will create global low-carbon pathways, green jobs and achieve shared climate goals”.As the world emerges from the pandemic, economic growth would depend on digital capabilities, which will be critical in how “our large populations work, study and interact”, he wrote.Noting that India had one of the largest digital economies in the world — with a digital GDP poised to cross $1 trillion by 2025, Sandhu said there are tremendous opportunities to expand collaboration in frontier technologies such as 5G, AI, big data analytics, quantum computing, blockchain and IoT, describing the digital and tech partnerships as the third area of cooperation.The next area of partnership was in the education domain as virtual collaborations had been made possible by bringing together the best minds in India and the US, he said.With more than 2,00,000 Indian students studying in the US, the education partnership had become a source of strength and an important bridge between the peoples of the two countries, Sandhu said.“This knowledge bridge has unleashed entrepreneurship and innovation from Boston to Bengaluru. As this is poised to expand, structured partnerships that take advantage of it will benefit both India and the US,” he added.Sandhu emphasised that none of these partnerships were possible without the guarantee of security, and it was natural that democracies with shared values should partner with each other to ensure a safer, more secure world.“Our deepening defence and strategic partnership, therefore, constitutes the fifth area of cooperation, which rests on a strong institutional framework for defence collaboration and our shared strategic interests. This will be particularly important in Asia, where we will work bilaterally and with like-minded partners to pursue a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, while advancing the security and economic interests of countries with legitimate and vital interests in the region,” Sandhu said.He underlined that beyond being natural partners, cooperation between the world’s oldest and largest democracies impacted real lives by creating prosperity, securing its peoples and advancing shared democratic values.“These five areas provide us with a robust platform: if we rise to the occasion, we can bring about a safer, healthier and more prosperous world,” he wrote.

17-02-2021||New Delhi||UNESCO, Bhumi Pednekar together to educate girls on menstrual hygiene||With an aim to raise awareness and educate girls on menstrual hygiene management, UNESCO has joined the #KeepGirlsInSchool mission, being supported by Bollywood actress Bhumi Pednekar.The movement, launched by feminine care brand Whisper, begins with shedding light on the impact of 2.3 crore girls dropping out of school due to lack of period education and protection. According to studies, even today, 71 per cent of adolescent girls in India remain unaware of menstruation till they get their first period. This affects their confidence and self-esteem adversely, leading to 2.3 crore adolescent girls dropping out of school every year, at the onset of the puberty. In addition to this, the ongoing pandemic has led to the closure of schools and lack of structured learning process, making these girls even more vulnerable to dropping out. According to the UNESCO, the global pandemic has impacted 74 crore schoolgirls, and could severely affect their return to school. To bring to light the struggles of young girls as they reach puberty, Whisper and UNESCO released a film that illustrates the journey of the playful innocence of a schoolgirl with boundless dreams coming to a grinding halt due to the lack of period education and protection. The film underscores the importance of empowering young girls to achieve their full potential and not let periods get in the way of 2.3 crore dreams. Continuing to share her support for the cause, Bhumi Pednekar said: “For the past one year I have been working closely with Whisper to drive awareness on the importance of menstrual hygiene education and protection. This gave me an understanding of the on-ground reality of crores of girls who drop out of school and unfortunately give up on their dreams of becoming a pilot, doctor, teacher, designer, etc. Every girl in India should be able to complete her education like I did and not have to drop out just because of periods. I strongly believe that empowering young girls with menstrual education and protection will give them wings to transform into leaders of tomorrow. It is great to see that Whisper and UNESCO are enabling this change at a ground level, which will not only accelerate the cause but also encourage wider participation. I urge everyone to come forward and be part of the #KeepGirlsInSchool movement.” Emphasizing UNESCO’s commitment to the right to Education, Eric Falt, Director and UNESCO Representative to Bhutan, India, Maldives and Sri Lanka, said: “During puberty and the start of menstruation, a girl’s confidence and self-esteem can be affected in many different ways, sometimes even leading to her dropping out of school. UNESCO and Whisper are on a mission to change that. The #KeepGirlsInSchool initiative builds on our strong commitment to ensuring everyone’s fundamental right to education. Investing in girls’ education is an investment for society as a whole.”Sharing her thoughts on the movement, Chetna Soni, Senior Director and Category Head, P&G Indian Subcontinent, Feminine Care, said: “Whisper believes in empowering girls and women to unleash their confidence and ensure that nothing comes in the way of achieving their dreams. With this mission, we continue to challenge the barriers surrounding menstrual hygiene through education and multi-stakeholder engagement to advocate for change. To widen the impact, we are delighted to be joining hands with UNESCO to further our force for female good movement #KeepGirlsInSchool. We strongly believe that we all have a role to play in breaking the menstrual stigma and normalizing periods so nothing can come in the way of girls fulfilling their dreams and achieving their full potential.”  --IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unesco-bhumi-pednekar-together-to-educate-girls-on-menstrual-hygiene-213697

17-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||BJP leaders meet amid mahapanchayats; hold strategy meeting with UP, Haryana, Rajasthan leaders||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 17With India’s farmers’ agitation and the three agriculture laws making international headlines, BJP president JP Nadda on Tuesday held a meeting with top leaders and functionaries from Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh — the states leading the stir along with Punjab.The meeting was aimed at discussing and devising the party’s strategy amid the string of mahapanchayats being organised by protesting farmer leaders.The meeting was also attended by Home Minister Amit Shah and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar.Minister of State Sanjeev Balyan, who belongs to the same ‘Balyan khap’ as BKU leader Rakesh Tikait and other leaders from the region; Sat Pal Singh (Baghpat MP), Krishan Pal and Om Prakash Dhankar from Haryana were among the others present along with MPs and MLAs from the region.Notably, the growing influence of Rakesh Tikait in western Uttar Pradesh, and now parts of Haryana and Rajasthan as well, is a matter of concern for the BJP as the movement is gaining support of non-Jats, including Dalits and Muslims, which was being considered a predominantly Jat-driven agitation.The saffron party has been sweeping western Uttar Pradesh and Jat-dominated regions on the back of consolidation of Hindu voters.However, emergence of Tikait as the new binding force at these mahapanchayats and the support from non-farming castes and Muslims to the farmers’ agitation has the potential to upset the carefully-nurtured vote bank that won it the Lok Sabha and the Assembly seats.Leaders of its rivals in Uttar Pradesh — Samajwadi party and the RLD — are already trying to woo these sections by building their narrative around “protecting village economy from pro-corporate policy of BJP governments”.Sources say the BJP is considering mega reach-out to the community at the highest level to blunt the growing perceptions against the party. Top leaders were expected to pitch in this campaign to “dispel the misconceptions being built against the farm laws and the party”, they said, confirming that mahapanchayats in Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan is among the reasons for the ‘manthan’ by the BJP leaders on Tuesday evening.The government and the party wanted to resolve the issue and “our doors are always open for farmers”, the sources added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-leaders-meet-amid-mahapanchayats-hold-strategy-meeting-with-up-haryana-rajasthan-leaders-213674
17-02-2021||Lucknow||‘God declared dead’ to grab land in UP||In a bizarre case of land grab in Uttar Pradesh, the deity of a temple was ‘declared dead’ in the mutation documents of the land deed title of a temple in Lucknow.The temple is said to be 100 years old, its land is spread over 7,000 sq km and run by a trust registered in the name of Lord Krishna-Ram. It is in Kushmaura Haluvapur village in the Mohanlalganj area.At some point in time, a man Gaya Prasad was added to the land record documents as the father of Lord Krishna-Ram.When consolidation of land records took place in 1987, Lord Krishna-Ram was declared ‘dead’. Subsequently, the trust was transferred to Gaya Prasad as his property.In 1991, Gaya Prasad was declared dead. The trust passed on to his brothers identified as Ramnath and Haridwar.Twenty-five years later, the matter came to light when the temple’s original trustee named, Sushil Kumar Tripathi filed a complaint with Naib-Tehsildar in 2016.The case travelled from the Naib-Tehsildar’s office to the district magistrate, and to the deputy chief minister’s office but without any results.It has now emerged that multiple mutations of the land have fraudulently taken place.Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma, who recently ordered a probe into the matter by SDM Prafulla Tripathi, said that the investigation revealed that somebody had forged the documents in the name of the man, who originally registered the trust.The forgery was done to grab temple land of around 7,300 square metres.According to SDM Sadar Prafulla Kumar Tripathi, the investigation established that both, the temple and land, were registered in the name of Lord Krishna-Rama in the past.Tripathi said the temple’s land was being described as barren land of the local gram sabha. The contention has been challenged at the SDM court and the case is under trial.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/god-declared-dead-to-grab-land-in-up-213672

Alongside Disha, lawyer Nikita Jacob and Muluk, the police are probing Pieter Friedrich.“Friedrich has been on our radar since 2006 when he was spotted with Bhajan Singh Bhinder (Iqbal Chaudhary), a vocal proponent of the ISI’s K2 desk,” said a Delhi Police officer.

In all, four party lawmakers resigned and a fifth was earlier disqualified for anti-party work.The Puducherry Assembly has 30 members and three nominated ones. With changed equations, both the ruling and the Opposition sides have 14 MLAs each. The Congress lost numbers in the Assembly just a day before Rahul Gandhi’s visit for a campaign. This will be Gandhi’s first visit here.Bedi was appointed LG in 2016 and has since been involved in a war of words with CM V Narayanasamy who, in a rare act, staged a dharna outside the Raj Bhavan in 2019 demanding Bedi’s recall.Soundararajan, the former Tamil Nadu BJP chief, was appointed Telangana Governor in September 2019. The Congress had won 15 seats in the 2016 polls. It wrested power with three DMK and one Independent MLA. The Opposition AIADMK has four MLAs, All India NR Congress seven and the BJP three nominated MLAs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kiran-bedi-removed-as-puducherry-l-g-213340

Trucks were involved in over 57,000 crashes during this period.According to the report, one of the biggest challenges in claiming compensation after a crash for truck drivers has been under-reporting of the incident and non filing of FIRs. Overall, about two-thirds (66 per cent) of the 420 truck drivers surveyed for the study hadn’t filed an FIR after the crash.The study noted that despite having a high rate of crashes and resultant injuries, it was found that none of the respondent truck drivers had applied or benefited from any government-run scheme for compensation. They had neither laid claim to or benefited from any government scheme like cashless treatment at hospitals, solatium fund for hit-and-run cases, or any other ex-gratia schemes at the central or state level. “The process of claiming insurance is fraught with challenges for vulnerable groups like truck drivers who often hail from LIH (lower income households) and disadvantaged sections of society,” the study observed. Only 40 per cent of the drivers were found to have life insurance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/meagre-earning-no-social-security-report-highlights-plight-of-truckers-213423

However, Narayanasamy rejected the demand, claiming that his government continued to enjoy 'majority' in the Assembly, which is set to go for polls in the next few months.With resignations of four MLAs, the strength of the Congress in the 33-member Assembly has decreased to 10, including the Speaker.

We condemn the recent incident if it is true that they set out to disrespect the Gurdwara. It is up to the Police now, and no one should take the law in their own hands.”The Sydney-based South Asia Times reported that such incidents seem to be dividing the community. “It is not clear who were the organisers of the ‘Tiranga Rally’and no one has claimed any responsibility for the same.”The Indian High Commission in London took on British MP Claudia Webbe opposing the arrest of Disha Ravi and backing the farmers’ agitation. In a four-page open letter, the High Commission invited the MP to “obtain facts and correct information from” the mission. It also pointed out that India’s internal law and order is a sovereign subject and “not open to external interference”.An Open Letter to Hon MP @ClaudiaWebbe pic.twitter.com/JdzyoHPfe8  All the missions abroad have been active in supporting the farm laws especially the several social media posts by PM Narendra Modi. They are also reaching out to diaspora Indians with frequent e-mailers justifying the government’s approach to the agitation.Recently, the missions forwarded “additional inputs from the Ministry of Agriculture” that said the Government has taken all conceivable steps to sort out the grievances of farmer unions who are “obstinately demanding the repeal of all the three laws”. The laws provide the much-needed enabling environment for farmers to sell their produce across the nation from their doorstep through these Farm Acts, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-missions-take-on-critiques-of-farm-laws-disha-ravis-arrest-213266

Evidently, law proscribes any act which has a tendency to create disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence,” the judge said in an order passed on February 15 .“In the absence of any exhortation, call, incitement or instigation to create disorder or disturbance of public peace by resort to violence or any allusion or oblique remark or even any hint towards this objective, attributable to the accused, I suspect that Section 124 A (sedition) IPC can be validly invoked against the applicant,” the order said.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-sedition-law-cannot-be-invoked-to-quiet-disquiet-says-delhi-court-213262

Those who tested positive, their genome sequencing being done. This is a good strategy. I hope we might follow this similar strategy for flights from South Africa and Brazil,” Bhushan said.Responding to a question on flight restrictions to South Africa and Brazil, he said India doesn’t have many direct flights to South Africa and Brazil. The flights are routed from various places like the Gulf. We will discuss and announce any preventive measures.NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul urged people to maintain vigil and keep following COVID-19 appropriate behaviour.“70 per cent of Indian population is still vulnerable. Vigil to contain this virus must continue. We still don’t fully understand the virus so we have to be serious about vaccination and COVID-19’s appropriate behaviour,” he said.Speaking about the vaccinations, Bhushan said as of February 16 till 1 pm, 87,40,595 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the country out of which a total of 62,82,646 healthcare workers have been vaccinated.First dose has been given to 61,11,968 (60.5 per cent healthcare workers) and second dose has been given to 1,70,678 healthcare workers, which is 37.5 per cent of eligible vaccinations, he said.Bhushan elaborated that the eligible population are people who were vaccinated on January 16, 17 and 18 as only they became eligible for the second dose.“For others, the second dose is not due.

Resident Coordinators are the UN Secretary-General’s representatives for development at the country level. They lead UN teams supporting countries to recover better from the COVID-19 pandemic through the SDGs.A TEDx speaker, he is a regular opinion contributor on humanitarian and development issues for a range of local, regional and international media outlets and journals, the UN said in a statement at the time of his appointment.Before coming to China, Chatterjee was the UN Resident Coordinator in Kenya where Kenya’s Minister for Sports Culture and Heritage Amina Mohammed said: “Chatterjee’s exemplary leadership leaves a lasting footprint in the execution of Government/UN collaboration impacting millions of lives in Kenya and the region”.             “We presented the gift of a giant footprint as a reminder of the unforgettable journey that he has walked with the people of Kenya,” she said in a farewell tweet.A staunch advocate of gender equality and youth empowerment, Chatterjee has also served in Switzerland, Denmark, Iraq, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan (Darfur), Indonesia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Iraqi Kurdistan.He has served in UN Peacekeeping, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), the UN Population Fund, the Red Cross movement, United Nations Office for Project Services and UN Security.The highlight of his career was the demobilisation of 3,551 child soldiers in South Sudan when he served with UNICEF during the height of a conflict in 2000.Observers say by confirming Chatterjee’s appointment, particularly at a time of border tensions with India as well as commencement of India’s two-year term as a non-permanent member in the UN Security Council, Beijing may be indicating its intent to dial down friction with New Delhi and strengthen multilateral cooperation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/siddharth-chatterjee-of-india-takes-over-as-top-un-diplomat-in-china-213225
