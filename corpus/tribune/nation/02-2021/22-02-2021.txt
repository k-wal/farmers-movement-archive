He said the president had been making such requests in writing from other heads of states as well.“We made the first request from India. When he (Rajapaksa) meets with the envoys of the respective countries, he hands over these letters to be sent to their leaders,” the foreign secretary said.The core group of countries that work on Sri Lanka’s issue at the UNHRC has indicated that it will move a resolution this time, but the Sri Lankan side is yet to see the draft of it, a top source said.The core group includes five countries—the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Macedonia and Montenegro.The government leaders have currently undertaken a lobbying spree to garner the support of like-minded countries to thwart any attempts to pass a resolution with content unacceptable to the country.The core group initially asked Sri Lanka to help bring a consensual resolution. However, Sri Lanka insisted that it cannot give a firm answer without seeing the content of it.During the UNHRC session next week, Sri Lanka’s record in human rights and related accountability will be probed.Last year in February, Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who oversaw a brutal end to a decades-long conflict with Tamil separatists, had said that the country was withdrawing from a United Nations’ resolution investigating alleged war crimes.Mahinda Rajapaksa was president when Sri Lankan troops defeated Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009, but rights groups accused the army of killing at least 40,000 civilians in the final months of the conflict.Sri Lanka had co-sponsored the resolution at the UNHRC along with 11 other countries calling for the investigation of allegations of wartime atrocities by both government forces and the Tamil Tiger rebels, who were fighting for a separate homeland for Sri Lanka’s ethnic Tamil minority, according to Al Jazeera.A UN report published last month warned that the failure of Sri Lanka to address past violations has significantly heightened the risk of human rights violations being repeated.The report urges enhanced monitoring and strong preventive action by the international community, warning that “Sri Lanka’s current trajectory sets the scene for the recurrence of the policies and practices that gave rise to grave human rights violations.” —ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sri-lanka-seeks-indias-support-ahead-of-unhrc-session-216127

But the current GST system has become a “major problem for small traders” because compliance becomes complicated, leading to unintentional mistakes.The new version of GST should be written in such a way that it can prevent tax evasion, the government gets more revenue and the trader segment should be encouraged to discharge their tax liability with minimal compliance, said FAIVM national president Jayendra Tanna and national general secretary VK Bansal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/traders-petition-pm-for-new-gst-regime-216126

There could be faster clearances for proposals from automobiles, electronics, chemicals and textiles sectors while the ones in sensitive categories such as data generation and finance may see slower clearances.A proposal that is stuck is the US giant General Motor’s (GM) plant to a Chinese company. Chinese company Great Wall and GM had jointly sought permission for the sale of the car plant.Great Wall plans to invest $1 billion in India and start selling cars from this year. Another Chinese automobile company SAIC, which owns the British brand MG Motor, plans to invest another $250 million.In April last year, the government had amended the foreign direct investment (FDI) policy to keep out China. At that time the government had said the approach was in line with that of  Germany, Italy and Australia which were changing their FDI laws to safeguard industries that were hit by the Covid pandemic and were ripe takeover targets.In India, the government kept out Chinese companies by stipulating that all countries that share borders with India must take approval before investing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-panel-to-vet-chinese-investments-216125

While Islamabad is keen to get off the grey list, India and several European countries feel Pakistan should continue to be kept on close watch for some more time.Delegates representing 205 members of the Global Network, and observer organizations, including the IMF, the UN and the World Bank, will take part in the meeting.Due to restrictions imposed by the pandemic, the meeting is taking place virtually.During three days of meetings, the FATF will work through a full agenda. Delegates will discuss the assessment of New Zealand’s measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.They will also discuss the impact of Covid on the assessments that remain to be completed in the current cycle and hear the progress made by some jurisdictions identified as presenting a risk to the financial system.The FATF will also finalise key reports, including a guidance on the risk-based approach to supervision. The outcomes of the FATF Plenary will be published on Thursday, at the close of the meeting.Days before the FATF plenary in Paris, Pakistani dissidents protested outside its headquarters in France, demanding Islamabad’s immediately blacklisting for its nexus with China and also for not taking action on terror financing and state sponsorship of terrorism.In the last plenary held in October 2020, Pakistan was compelled to remain on the grey list till February 2021 because it had not met six out of 27 action plan targets on anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT).Islamabad claims that it has since complied with a major part of the six remaining recommendations. It also claims significant progress in legislation as well as its implementation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-on-the-hook-as-fatf-meet-begins-216124
22-02-2021||Mumbai||‘Yahi hai acche din? Shiv Sena slams Centre over rising fuel prices||As the prices of petrol and diesel in the country are on a constant rise, Yuva Sena, the youth wing of Shiv Sena has put up banners stating ‘Yahi hai acche din?’ at various petrol pumps and roadsides in Mumbai, in a bid to register their protest against the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.This comes as the prices of petrol and diesel are increasing continuously for several days and in some states, the price of petrol has even crossed Rs 100 mark.Union Petroleum and Natural Gas and Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday had termed “less fuel production by manufacturing countries to gain more profit”, as one of the reasons behind the price hike.“There are two main reasons behind the fuel price rise. The international market has reduced fuel production and manufacturing countries are producing less fuel to gain more profit. This is making the consumer countries suffer,” Pradhan had told ANI during his visit to inspect the venue where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to address a rally in Assam’s Dhemaji on Monday.On Thursday, Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut hit out at the Central government over the rise in petrol prices and asked: “Where is the money going?” “Where is the money going? Is it going to West Bengal? This is wrong, if it is so,” Raut said while speaking to ANI.The Shiv Sena leader also said that he had read the government’s statement that the Centre is not responsible for the rising prices of petrol and diesel but the previous government.“You are at the Centre for 7 years with full majority, but whenever any question rises including inflation, corruption, national security matters or China enters the Indian territories, the answer of this government always remains the same,” he had said. —ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yahi-hai-acche-din-shiv-sena-slams-centre-over-rising-fuel-prices-216123

22-02-2021||New Delhi||PM must come out of A/C cars to feel pain of common man: Robert Vadra on fuel price hike||Robert Vadra, businessman and son-in-law of Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi, on Monday slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi over fuel price hike and said he should come out from air-conditioned cars and see people’s suffering.“You (PM) must come out from A/C cars and see how people are suffering and perhaps then you would reduce fuel prices. All he does is blame other previous governments for everything and move on,” Vadra said while speaking to ANI.“For everything Prime Minister Modi blames United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and the previous government. If something goes wrong then my name will be raised. He always blames others and keeps going,” he added.“What Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said was right that they (BJP) only think about two people,” he added.“To feel the problem and pain of common people one has to come on the road,” he added.“If I have to be people’s voice then first I have to ride a bicycle to feel their pain then only I can make their voice strong. We can only request the prime minister to look into the matter,” Vadra added.Asserting that Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi has written a letter to PM Modi and demanded to reduce fuel prices, he said: “Already because of COVID-19 people are in trouble, and facing this inflation. They are not able to live properly. The government will have to understand their problem.”Vadra rode a bicycle from his Sujan Singh Park residence to his Sukhdev Vihar office in protest against the rising fuel prices.Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to convey “every citizen’s anguish and deep distress regarding the spiralling fuel and gas prices”.Citing the COVID-19 pandemic, the Congress chief had in the letter alleged that in distressing time, the Central government is making a profit from people’s misery and suffering.She termed the rise in fuel prices as “short of extortion to cover up economic mismanagement” and urged the prime minister to follow ‘Raj Dharma’ and reduce fuel prices by partially rolling back excise duty. — ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-must-come-out-of-a-c-cars-to-feel-pain-of-common-man-robert-vadra-on-fuel-price-hike-216117

While the editor did so, Singh failed to appear before the court, he said.Digvijay Singh's counsel had filed a petition, seeking exemption from appearance on medical grounds, but the court dismissed it and issued the NBW, said Asif Amjad.The court has now posted the matter for March 8.Singh's counsel said they had already filed a stay extension petition before the High Court to quash the proceedings.

22-02-2021||Sunit Dhawan||Now, car won’t start if driver is drunk!||Tribune News ServiceRohtak, February 22With a view to preventing road accidents and casualties caused therein, an engineering student of Haryana has developed a software based on artificial intelligence which would not allow a car to start if the driver has consumed excessive alcohol or does not put on the seat-belt. The software also has a mechanism to assist the driver in detecting objects around the car in fog.“As soon as the driver touches the steering wheel after consuming excessive alcohol, moisture on his hands will alert the sensors installed therein and he/she won’t be able to start the car. Besides, the driver’s breath will trigger the sensors if he/she has consumed excessive alcohol,” says Mohit, a second-year student of B.Tech course at Chandigarh University, who has developed Road Pulse software.The software would also not allow the car engine to start if the driver does not put on the seatbelt. There are three sensors on the seatbelt and a person would be able to drive the car only after buckling up the seatbelt.“The software will also prevent accidents due to the reckless overtaking of vehicles without using indicators as it will automatically turn on indicators as soon as the driver is about to switch a lane. This happens with the pre-installed Google maps in the software,” maintains Mohit.He points out that poor another major reason behind road accidents is fog, which reduces visibility. There is an inbuilt ultrasonic radar system in the software which lets the driver know if there is anything blocking his/her way within a radius of 50 metres.Twenty-year-old Mohit already owns six start-ups and has got 24 patents, including one for the said software. He has been selected by Google for a paid internship and was among three students from India shortlisted by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for job as a scientist.Mohit has been felicitated as a young entrepreneur by the Government of India and is also the founder of Sky Messenger, a web-based communication platform like WhatsApp, which is being used by lakhs of people across the world.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/now-car-wont-start-if-driver-is-drunk-216096
22-02-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena targets Centre, Bollywood stars over rising fuel prices||The Shiv Sena on Monday trained its guns on the Centre over the rising fuel prices, saying instead of collecting donations for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, the government should take steps to bring down the rates of petrol and diesel in the country.The party, which heads the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, also raised the issue of Bollywood stars maintaining silence over the skyrocketing fuel prices, a stand earlier taken by its ally the Congress.In the editorial of its mouthpiece Saamana, the Shiv Sena said reducing petrol and diesel prices will ensure the devotees of Lord Ram get food.The Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, a body formed by the Centre, has been mandated with overseeing the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya. A nationwide drive to collect funds for the temple kicked off last month.The Shiv Sena said it is the duty of the government to control the prices of essential items.People should do away with this loss of memory (of the government), if the government at the Centre has forgotten its duty (of controlling prices).Bring down the prices of petrol and diesel instead of collecting donations for the Ram temple construction. Ram devotees will get food because of it (reduction in prices) and Lord Shri Ram, too, will be happy, the Shiv Sena said.The Uddhav Thackeray-led party questioned why the BJP which otherwise stages agitation every now and then has kept quiet over the issue of rising fuel prices.The Marathi daily said Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems to be blaming the previous governments for the current fuel price woes.Modi had last week said the middle-class would not have been burdened with high petrol and diesel prices if the previous governments had focussed on reducing India’s energy import.Without referring to the relentless increase in retail fuel prices, which are linked to global rates, the PM had said India imported over 85 per cent of its oil needs in the 2019- 20 financial year and 53 per cent of its gas requirement.The previous governments set up public undertakings like Indian Oil, ONGC and Bharat Petroleum, but Modi is selling them and now blaming the earlier regimes for fuel price rise, the Shiv Sena said.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday had said the Centre and state governments will together have to work out a mechanism to bring retail rates of petrol and diesel to reasonable levels.The Saamana editorial recalled actors like Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan had expressed views on petrol and diesel price rise before 2014 (when the Congress-led UPA was in power at the Centre).The celebrities are now quiet despite petrol price crossing the Rs 100 per litre mark (in Rajasthan), it said.The Shiv Sena, a former BJP ally, claimed the celebrities are keeping quiet because they have been made to remain so.It also means, there was freedom to express views, to criticise before 2014. One was not jailed under sections relating to treason if he/she criticised government policies.Today, we have lost even the freedom of expressing anger over petrol-diesel price rise. Therefore, why blame Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan unnecessarily, it said.The Congress in Maharashtra had recently targeted the actors, asking why are they keeping quiet over the fuel price rise, and threatened to stall their films in the state.

Almost entire population of the state had now been covered under the Ujjwala Yojana, and one crore women had benefited, he added.“The gas pipelines, optical fibre networks and piped water supply initiatives are not mere iron pipes and fibre. These are the new fate lines of India,” he asserted.He said improvement in energy and infrastructure development would make life easier for the people of Assam and the northeast and create fresh job opportunities for youth.Oil storage capacity had been strengthened for the purpose of refining and meeting emergency situations, he said.“Assam is known the world over for its tea, tourism, handloom and handicraft. The growth of these sectors will generate more employment and strengthen the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ mission,” he said.Reaching out to tea garden workers, a solid support base of the BJP, Modi said improving their living condition was a priority of both the state and the Central governments.“With the blessings of the Brahmaputra, the land in this region is fertile. We are working for improving farm income, providing agriculturists better seeds, soil health cards and introducing pension schemes,” he said.Farm laws have been amended to ensure their produce reaches international markets, the Prime Minister said. He said his government had earmarked Rs 20,000 crore for strengthening the fisheries sector and Assam will hugely benefit from it.Modi said he would visit Assam and other poll bound states as many times as possible before elections are announced, likely in first weeek of March.

22-02-2021||Chandigarh||Army lays groundwork for developing futuristic communication system||With the increasing dominance of the electronic spectrum, cyber warfare and artificial intelligence, the Army has laid the groundwork to introduce a futuristic communication system for providing secure and seamless interconnectivity between its warfighting elements and also enhance situational awareness.“The Indian Army is planning a LTE-based communication grid with Internet of Military Things (IoMT) sensor network for providing failsafe, robust and secure communication to its formations and units along the northern and eastern borders,” a request for information floated a few days ago states.This will require designing and developing, with industry support, a communication grid with its radio access network, core network and IoMT compatible network along with sensors and interfaces to provide surveillance, situational awareness, sensor network and compatible interfaces for legacy surveillance devices currently in the Army’s inventory.Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is a standard for wireless broadband communication for mobile devices that increases the capacity and speed of data transfer and provides several add-on facilities. IoMT is a type of Internet of Things designed for combat operations and warfare based upon smart technology and artificial intelligence. It comprises a complex network of interconnected entities in the military domain that continually communicate with each other to accomplish a broad range of activities in a more efficient and informed manner.The network would facilitate a state of the art mobile communication and sensor network for troops operating in a counter-insurgency environment, rugged mountains and jungles overlooking the Line of Control and international borders through the use of handheld communication devices and e-tabs.The project envisions high grade and reliable mobile communication with a layer of security for voice, data and video communication to make the traffic secure and make the network free from the possibility of intrusion and interception, prevent unauthorized access.The proposed LTE-based communication grid with IoMT sensor network will also be capable of interoperability with existing mobile communication network and would be integrated into the armed forces’ current and futuristic communication infrastructure and networks.It will also have an IoMT sensor network, seismic, pressure and ultrasonic ground sensors autonomous UAVs and drones, information nodes, helmet-mounted cameras and interfaces for current surveillance equipment as well as an ecosystem for controlling and monitoring the sensor data from all IoMT devices.Only Indian vendors and those who tie-ups with foreign original equipment manufacturers having their registered offices along with operations, maintenance and repair infrastructure in India would be allowed to participate in the project.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-lays-groundwork-for-developing-futuristic-communication-system-216070

But the government in Delhi is unable to understand the pain of the farmers,” Gandhi said while addressing a meeting organised after the 6-km tractor rally between Thrikkaipatta and  Muttil in this hill district.“We have pop stars who are commenting on the situation of Indian farmers but the Indian government is not interested. They are not going to take back the laws unless they are forced,” the Wayanad MP said.He alleged that the laws are designed to destroy the agriculture system in India and give the entire business to two to three friends of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Stating that agriculture is the biggest business in the country worth Rs 40 lakh crore and it is owned by millions and millions of Indians, the Congress leader said, “Agriculture is the only business that belongs to Bharat Mata and a few people want to own this business.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agriculture-is-the-only-business-that-belongs-to-bharat-mata-rahul-says-at-wayanad-tractor-rally-216068
22-02-2021||New Delhi||SC to take up contempt plea against comic artist Kunal Kamra after 4 weeks||The Supreme Court Monday adjourned for four weeks the hearing on the plea seeking contempt against stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra over his alleged scandalous tweets against the judiciary.A bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and R S Reddy deferred the matter after an adjournment was sought by some petitioners who wanted time to file a rejoinder to the reply filed by Kamra.One of the petitions in the Kamra case has been filed by law student Shrirang Katneshwarkar and others.Kamra in his reply had defended the allegedly scandalous tweets against the judiciary, saying India would be reduced to a “country of incarcerated artists and flourishing lapdogs” if powerful people and institutions show an inability to “tolerate rebuke or criticism”.The comedian, facing contempt proceedings, also said that there was a growing culture of intolerance where taking offence is seen as a fundamental right and has been elevated to the status of a “much loved national indoor sport”.On December 18 last year, the top court issued a show-cause notice to Kamra for his alleged scandalous tweets against the apex court and exempted him from personal appearances.Attorney General K K Venugopal had granted consent for initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against Kamra, saying the comedian’s tweets were in “bad taste” and it was the time that people understand that attacking the apex court brazenly would attract punishment.The consent of either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General is necessary under Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act for initiating contempt proceedings against a person.Criminal contempt of the Supreme Court is punishable with a fine of up to Rs 2,000 and imprisonment of up to six months.The petitioners have claimed that the stand-up comedian had started publishing tweets on November 11 last year when the top court was hearing the appeal of Arnab Goswami against the Bombay High Court’s order rejecting the journalist’s plea seeking interim bail in a 2018 abetment-to-suicide case.The plea alleged that after the top court granted interim bail to Goswami on November 11, Kamra “again published various tweets and thereby scandalized” the apex court and “further lowered” its authority. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-take-up-contempt-plea-against-comic-artist-kunal-kamra-after-4-weeks-216063

Talapady in Mangalore taluk, Saradka in Bantwal, Nettanige-Mudnuru in Puttur taluk and Jalsoor in Sullia, to verify and allow people's entry into Karnataka.The residents in and around Kasaragod, the northernmost district of Kerala, have been thronging Mangaluru in Karnataka for decades for treatment at the speciality hospitals there.While Mangaluru is just about 10 to 50 km from anywhere from Kasaragod, the nearest available facility is in Kannur, which is as far as 100 km.People in and around Kasaragod had struggled a lot during the initial days of the lockdown when the Karnataka authorities restricted the movement of people into their territory.Strict guidelines on producing medical certificates to get an entry for the critically ill-patients had also turned out to be a nightmare for follow-up treatments during those days.There were instances of death of patients as the authorities disallowed their entry even for critical medical care.However, the intervention of the apex court had facilitated permission for critically ill patients to cross over to Mangaluru for treatment.Now, the plight of the poor but critical patients from the district is much pathetic as they need to undergo a Rs 1,700 RT-PCR test to enable entry into Mangaluru for follow-up treatment, local people complained. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-protocols-karnataka-closes-borders-with-kerala-again-216055

22-02-2021||New Delhi||SC notice to FRL, others on Amazon plea against HC direction for status quo on Future-Reliance deal||The Supreme Court on Monday sought responses from Future Retail Ltd (FRL) and others on Amazon’s plea against the Delhi High Court direction to maintain status quo on the Future-Reliance deal.The apex court said the proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) would go on and but would not culminate into any final order on amalgamation of FRL with Reliance.A bench comprising Justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai issued notices to FRL, Chairperson Kishore Biyani and others and sought their replies.The reply be filed in three weeks and a rejoinder to it after two weeks thereafter, the bench said, adding that the appeal would be listed for hearing after five weeks.The Delhi High Court on February 8 had stayed its single judge direction to FRL and various statutory authorities to maintain status quo with regard to the Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail.The interim direction was passed on FRL’s appeal challenging the February 2 order of the single judge.The HC bench had also declined Amazon’s request to keep its order in abeyance for a week so that it can explore appropriate remedies.Amazon had first filed a plea before the single judge for enforcement of the October 25, 2020 Emergency Arbitrator (EA) award by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), restraining FRL from going ahead with its Rs 24,713-crore deal with Reliance Retail.In the interim order, the high court had said it was staying the single judge order as firstly, FRL was not a party to the share subscription agreement (SSA) between Amazon and Future Coupons Private Limited (FCPL), and the US e-commerce giant was not a party to the deal between FRL and Reliance Retail.The bench further said it was of the prima facie view that the shareholding agreement (SHA) between FRL and FCPL, the SSA between FCPL and Amazon, and the deal between FRL and Reliance Retail “are different” and “therefore, the group of companies’ doctrine cannot be invoked”.Another reason given by the court for its interim order was that there was prima facie no reason to seek a status quo order before the single judge.The bench said there were a lot of contentious issues involved in the matter and it was not going to adjudicate on them at this stage.It also said its observations were only prima facie and the single judge ought not to be influenced by them when pronouncing the order on Amazon’s plea for enforcement of the October 25, 2020 Emergency Arbitrator (EA) award by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) restraining FRL from going ahead with its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail.The order by the division bench had come after the conclusion of arguments, over a period of three days, by FRL and Amazon on Future Retail’s plea challenging the single judge’s February 2 order.FRL, in its appeal, has claimed that if the February 2 order was not stayed it “would be an absolute disaster” for it as the proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for approving the amalgamation scheme have been put on hold.It has contended that the single judge’s status quo order will effectively derail the entire scheme, which has been approved by statutory authorities in accordance with law.In its suit before the single judge for enforcing the EA award, Amazon has sought to restrain FRL from taking any steps to complete the transaction with entities that are a part of the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (MDA) Group.Amazon has also sought detention of directors of FCPL and FRL, the Biyanis, and other related parties in civil prison, and attaching of their properties for alleged “wilful disobedience” of the EA order.In August last, Future had reached an agreement to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to Reliance. Subsequently, Amazon took FRL into an emergency arbitration before the SIAC over alleged breach of contract.After the SIAC’s EA order of October 25, 2020, was passed, Amazon wrote to the SEBI, stock exchanges and CCI, urging them to take into consideration the arbitrator’s interim decision as it is a binding order.FRL, thereafter moved the high court to restrain the Amazon from writing to SEBI, CCI and other regulators about SIAC’s order, saying it amounts to interfering with the agreement with RIL.A single judge on December 21, last had on FRL’s plea passed an interim order allowing Amazon to write to the statutory authorities, but also said prima facie it appeared the US e-commerce giant’s attempt to control Future Retail was violative of the FEMA and the FDI rules.Against the observations, Amazon moved an appeal before a division bench and during its pendency, Amazon filed the suit for the enforcement of the EA award.

22-02-2021||New Delhi||6 foreign ministers to address Asia Economic Dialogue||The Pune International Centre (PIC) will co-chair this year’s Asia Economic Dialogue (AED) that will be addressed by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his counterparts from Japan, Australia, Maldives, Mauritius and Bhutan, veteran diplomat Gautam Bambawale said at a virtual press conference on Monday.Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, his predecessor Vijay Gokhale, and Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhwan will also address the virtual meet.To be co-hosted by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), the AED will be held over three days from February 26 to February 28. PIC President R Mashelkar said the conference is part of a strategic agenda to make it the ‘Davos of East’ on global geo-economics in tune with the shifting of economic gravity from the West to Asia.Asked if the guest list indicated an alignment against China, Bambawale said he wouldn’t reach that conclusion since among the invitees are Chinese nationals working with the Asian Development Bank and the Beijing-headquartered AIIB. The conference will steer clear of politics and focus purely on geo-economics, he added.Bambawale conceded that this time there is no speaker from Pakistan. The meet would address larger issues that impact not just Asia, but the world, and in subsequent conferences, speakers from Pakistan could be invited, added India’s former Ambassador to China, Pakistan and Bhutan. The conference under the theme of ‘The post-Covid global trade and finance dynamics’ will begin on February 26 with an inaugural session on ‘Resilient global growth in post-pandemic world’ featuring industrialist Naushad Forbes in conversation with Jaishankar and Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne. Japanese FM Motegi Toshimitsu will join in with a tape-recorded message.The second session, to be chaired by former Chairman of ICICI Bank and NDB, Shanghai, K V Kamath, ‘Global finance in the post-Covid world’ will feature bankers from multilateral banks.Day two, on February 27, will begin with the industry-focussed session on ‘Building reliable global chains’ that will be addressed by senior corporate managers and industrialists from several parts of the world.The second session will also feature specialists from around the world, this time related to the World Trade Organisation. This could perhaps be the first multi-nation meeting of specialists on WTO after the appointment of a new DG Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.On February 28, perspectives on international development cooperation will be shared by veteran diplomats as well as the Foreign Ministers of Bhutan, Maldives and Mauritius.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/6-foreign-ministers-to-address-asia-economic-dialogue-216050
22-02-2021||New Delhi||India committed to enhancing capabilities in defence manufacturing: Modi||India had an age-old experience in making arms and military equipment but after Independence this capacity was not strengthened, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday, asserting that now the country is committed to enhancing its capabilities in defence manufacturing at a fast pace.Addressing a webinar on the effective implementation of the Union Budget's provisions in the defence sector, the Prime Minister listed a series of measures taken by his government to boost self-reliance in the defence sector."Before Independence we used to have hundreds of ordnance factories. In both the World Wars, arms were exported from India on a large scale, but after Independence due to a number of reasons, this system was not strengthened as much as it should have been," he said."The condition is such that even for small arms we have to look at other nations. India is amongst the biggest defence importers and this is not a matter of pride," Modi stressed.He said it was not that the people of India do not have the talent or capability and pointed out that India did not make ventilators before the coronavirus period but now manufactures thousands of ventilators."An India that could reach Mars, could have made modern weapons also but it became an easy way to import weapons from abroad," he said.But now India is working hard to change the situation and is committed to enhancing its capacities and capabilities at a fast pace, the Prime Minister asserted.Modi said with initiatives like de-licensing, de-regulation, export promotion, foreign investment liberalisation, the government has taken several measures to give the defence manufacturing sector a boost.He said that with establishment of the chief of defence staff post, bringing uniformity in the procurement process and induction of equipment had become easy.

The agency asked her to join the probe.She responded to the summons on Monday and asked the CBI to visit her residence between 11 am and 3 pm on Tuesday."Though I am unaware of the reason for me being called for questioning or the subject matter of the investigation, you may visit my residence as per your convenience between 11 am and 3 pm tomorrow, i.e. 23 February, 2021," Rujira said in a letter to CBI."You are requested to kindly inform me your schedule," she said.Two woman officers of the CBI also visited the residence of Gambhir, Rujira’s sister, and examined her for nearly three hours after a notice was served on her on Sunday, officials of the agency said.The officers of the CBI's anti-corruption branch sought to ascertain her financial accounts, they said.The developments took place ahead of the Assembly elections in West Bengal, which are likely to be held in April-May.After the summonses were issued on Sunday, the TMC hit out at the BJP-led Central government alleging political vendetta, while the saffron party said that the TMC was trying to politicise the matter.The CBI on November 28 last year carried out a massive search operation in a number of locations in four states – West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh – after registering a case against one Anup Majee alias Lala.It is claimed that Lala, the alleged kingpin of the scam, was involved in illegal mining and theft of coal from leasehold mines of ECL in Kunustoria and Kajora areas, sources said.Premises of two general managers of ECL, three officers, unknown officials of ECL, CISF and Indian Railways were raided along with that of Majee on that day.

Earlier, it had allowed him to travel to the UK, the US, France, Germany and Spain.The Congress leader is facing several criminal cases related to the Aircel-Maxis deal and the Foreign Investment Promotion Board clearance to the INX Media for receiving foreign funds of Rs 305 crore when his father, P Chidambaram, was the union finance minister.The cases are being probed by the ED and the CBI.The ED had earlier claimed that Karti Chidambaram had been trying to protract the investigation by “blatantly misusing” the liberty granted by the court in allowing him to travel abroad.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-allows-karti-chidambaram-to-travel-abroad-216045

In the UK in the US we have seen a lot of celebrities taking a very public position against what the government of the time was doing... be it the ‘Black Lives Matter, be it ‘Taking the Knee’. They took very symbolic positions. Here (why they don’t do it in India) is because of the fear of the institutions being weakened and then they not having the recourse to justice or just fear of being harassed,” Gul explained.Celebrities, including cricketing great Sachin Tendulkar, current Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli and some from the film fraternity including Akshay Kumar and Karan Johar joined the ‘India against propaganda’ drive after pop icon Rihanna and climate activist Greta Thunberg supported the farmers’ protest. The Indian celebrities copped a lot of flak for voicing their pro-government stance.Gul, however, points to the fact that the only reason why some of the famous personalities who used to mock the previous government for fuel price rise are mum on the same issues today because they fear reprisals.“This is a government that rules by fear. The previous government could be mocked as they weren’t afraid. But clearly, this government is hypersensitive to mockery and they rule by fear. So they have instilled fear and effectively taken away your ability to speak on things that you want to speak,” she said on behalf of her fraternity.“The manner in which organise lobbies come after celebrities who have spoken out in the past is proof why they shouldn’t speak out. They have come after people like Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan and even Salman Khan. And the other very critical aspect is that something I learnt from my father (Lt Gen HS Panag). My father rose to one the highest position possible in the Indian Army. And he is a very outspoken person as he has always called spade a spade. And yet he was able to rise to the top how? Because he didn’t have skeletons in the closet. Point is that you can’t afford to have skeletons in your closet and then take on the powers that be,” she explained.While she may have sympathies with the ones who are choosing to stay silent, Gul wants them to open up as it only emboldens perpetrators.“Your silence may promote a culture and something that does affect you will be trampled upon in due course. The very act of not speaking up enables those who transgress. It enables the perpetrators of injustice,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/celebrities-dont-speak-up-as-they-fear-reprisals-from-govt-gul-panag-216023

Thank FM Alan Ganoo for his warm welcome. Look forward to a fruitful visit,” Jaishankar tweeted soon after his arrival here. He will also meet the minister of foreign affairs, regional integration and international trade and minister for land transport and light rail.During his visit, Jaishankar will review all aspects of bilateral relations, ongoing implementation of various infrastructure projects being carried out by India in Mauritius, and hold discussions on bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest including India’s assistance to Mauritius.Before leaving for Mauritius, Jaishankar reaffirmed its commitment to the Maldives’ security and signed a $50 million defence Line of Credit agreement with the strategically vital Indian Ocean island nation to boost its maritime capabilities. He also held in-depth talks with the country’s top leaders to further cement bilateral ties.Jaishankar also witnessed the signing of a project execution contract for construction of roads in the southern-most island atoll Addu, which, he said, underscored the importance of connectivity in India-Maldives ties.The last visit of an External Affairs Minister was in August 2018 when Sushma Swaraj visited Mauritius for the World Hindi Conference.Mauritius PM Pravind Jugnauth last visited India on a private visit along with his spouse in December 2019, the visit being symbolic since it came just after his victory in the General Election.

She wants to ensure the presence of a bigger crowd in her meeting and take the upper hand over Modi.Dilip Yadav, president of TMC’s Hoogly district unit, however, refused to admit that the meeting at Sahaganj has been organised at a short notice by Mamata to show that she was more popular than the Prime Minister.“The Prime Minister is coming. May be he will come again. But people know that he has not done anything for the state. He has only belittled the state’s culture and tradition and tried to mess up its economy. On the other hand, Mamata is genuinely concerned about the development of the state,” Yadav said.Locket Chatterjee, BJP MP from Hoogly constituency, alleged that Mamata’s decision to hold a rally at the same venue as Modi within 48 hours of Modi’s programme there only showed how nervous she had become.“Why is she so scared of Modi. The TMC lost Hoogly seat to BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha General Election. They will not get a single seat in the district in the Assembly elections,” Locket said.While Hoogly seat was won by Locket in the Lok Sabha poll, the neighbouring Arambagh (six assembly segments in Hoogly district and one in Pashchim Medinipur) and Srerampur (five segments in Hoogly and two in Howrah) were both won by the TMC in 2019.In the Lok Sabha elections, the TMC was ahead in 10 of Hoogly district’s 18 assembly segments. The BJP had majority in the remaining eight seats.Assembly elections in the district are going to be a neck-and-neck fight between the BJP and TMC with back-to-back rallies by PM and Mamata setting the ball rolling for high-voltage showdown that would follow.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-mamatas-back-to-back-rallies-in-hoogly-215743

Citing an instance, he said while inaugurating a National Highways Authority of India project, he said many things and media reports of the event gave an impression he was critical of “babus and engineers”.Addressing the 221st mid-term council meeting of the Indian Roads Congress today, the minister said he “felt bad” about the reports as “there were many good people too who were working hard”.Gadkari blamed the media for allegedly blowing out of proportion an adverse comment and painting the whole bureaucracy with the same brush. He lauded senior NHAI officer Manoj Kumar, entrusted with the responsibility of supervising the Delhi-Mumbai express highway. “Under Manoj Kumar’s leadership, people are working day and night. The cost of the project, expected to be completed in a year and a half, is Rs 1 lakh crore,” he said.The minister said NHIDCL personnel engaged in the Zojila tunnel project in Ladakh deserved praise as they were working at -12 degrees Celsius. He said whatever praise he got as a minister was due to the hard work of the officers and engineers in his ministry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-pm-berates-babus-gadkari-says-not-all-bad-215748

I urge you to roll back these increases in fuel prices and pass on the benefit to our middle and salaried class, farmers and poor. I hope you will agree that it is time for your government to focus on solutions instead of looking for excuses. India deserves better,” she said in her letter today.‘India deserves better’ Govts are elected to ease people’s burden. I urge you to roll back hike in fuel prices and pass on the benefit to middle and salaried class, farmers and poor. India deserves better. — Sonia Gandhi, Congress chiefAccusing the government of profiteering from people’s misery, the Congress chief said the middle class and those at the margins were struggling, while “the government has chosen to profiteer off people’s misery”.She said fuel prices were at an historic and unsustainable high, petrol had breached the Rs 100/litre mark in many parts and surging diesel prices had hit the farmers.“What baffles most citizens is that these prices have been increased despite moderate prices of international crude oil. Crude oil price is nearly half of what it was during the UPA government’s tenure. Therefore, your government’s act of raising prices (continuously for 12 days till February 20) is little less than a brazen act of profiteering,” she alleged.The Congress chief said the BJP government had increased excise duty on diesel by 820 per cent and on petrol by 258 per cent over and collected upwards of Rs 21 lakh crore in the past six and a half years.“This unaccounted-for windfall is yet to be passed to the people for whose benefit it was ostensibly collected. The whole principle of deregulation and dynamic pricing was predicated on the principle that reductions in crude oil prices will proportionately benefit the end consumers,” she added.“Instead, your government has been unreasonably overzealous in levying excessive excise duty on petrol and diesel. This is nothing short of extortion to cover up economic mismanagement. As the principal party in opposition, I urge upon you to follow ‘Raj dharma’ and reduce fuel prices by partially rolling back excise duty,” Gandhi demanded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/roll-back-fuel-lpg-price-hike-sonia-writes-to-pm-215752

Vadra during her visit to Banwar village today said the Congress would raise its voice for the rights of the fishermen.She also attacked the state BJP government saying, “The Central farm laws were enacted for the benefit of few corporate and not farmers. Likewise the state government here is also making rules to deny the rights of fishermen and help industrialists and mining mafia.”She said the life of any civilisation depended on the life of the rivers and this was something the Nishads understood well.“You understand the pain of our rivers. The state government is on the side of the mining mafia and not on the side of the Nishad community. Just as the black farm laws have been enacted to benefit few corporate, the UP government is also backing the mining mafia.”Vadra said the BJP government in UP did not want to help the fishermen even though it came to power on their votes.“Your boats have been destroyed. We will raise this issue and fight for you. Your community has helped the BJP come to power in UP. When leaders forget whose votes propelled them to power, they lose their way,” Vadra said, noting that sand mining on river beds continued unabated despite orders to the contrary from the National Green Tribunal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priyanka-assures-legal-aid-to-boatmen-in-fight-against-yogi-215745

RBI has the largest Twitter followers among major central banks.What’s interesting about the latest campaign is that the central bank, which since the lockdowns has been very active on social media, has deployed a peppy rap music to issue its latest directives to the public on how they can and should protect themselves against cybercrimes and identity theft.Significantly, Viruss has done the video pro bono for the central bank.The campaign appeals and encourages the public, especially the tech-savvy netizens who tends to transact online, on staying ‘satark’ or alert against some common fraudsters and cyber security threats..@RBI Kehta Hai..A little caution takes care of a lot of trouble. Never respond to requests to share PIN, OTP or bank account details. Block your card if stolen, lost or compromised.#rbikehtahai #StaySafe#BeAware #BeSecurehttps://t.co/mKPAIp5rA3 pic.twitter.com/V3PRYl5351  The Reserve Bank since 2016 has been running a campaign ‘RBI Kehta Hai’ (RBI Says) on social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Youtube apart from the traditional media but was never as peppy and musical as this time.What is unique about the present campaign is that it has used the medium to issue its latest public directive that warns netizens against cyber frauds, including those on the UPI.Since 2016 when it created the tagline RBI Kehta Hai, the central bank’s communication has been centred on financial literacy and public awareness towards frauds, etc.The RBI uses the media to talk about the facilities it offers for senior citizens, cyber security, digital banking, and setting limits on card transactions.The RBI’s Twitter handle is the largest among the major central bankers with over 1 million followers.Apart from the official Twitter account, Governor Shaktikanta Das, who assumed office in December 2018, has a separate Twitter handle with 1.35 lakh followers.Since March 2019, the count of followers has more than doubled from just about 3,42,000 to over 7,50,000 by March 2020.

22-02-2021||New Delhi||Security beefed up at Singhu border||In order to avoid any untoward incident at the protest site where farmers are protesting against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre, the police have beefed up the security at Singhu border and adjoining areas.Around 100 CCTV cameras at both the stages and many locations including the areas outside restrooms earmarked for women protesters have been installed along with heavy deployment of police personnel near the barricades close to the protest site. Two control rooms for monitoring of CCTV cameras have also been set up behind both the stages.The number of volunteers for security check at every entry and exit gates along the way from Singhu village to Kundli village has also been increased.“Activities of people moving around are being monitored and volunteers are keeping a close watch on people coming from outside and farmers staying on tractor trollies. Since there are many cuts for entry and exit towards the villages so the volunteers have been deployed at every possible spot. Volunteers are also patrolling on tractors especially after the sun set,” said Maninder Singh, a member of Krantikari Kisan Union in Punjab who is also part of security management at Singhu.Height of concrete barricades that were setup earlier by Delhi Police close to the protest site (towards Delhi) have been increased by putting barbed wire on them. Whereas barricades put at four spots along the way from Singhu to Singhola village (Delhi-Chandigarh) highway were added with barbed wire after stone-pelting incidents.Drone cameras are been used by the security forces to monitor the situation. However, Delhi Police personnel along with the paramilitary forces deployed at the protest site have been decreased while the entry of visitors and mediapersons from the main gate is still banned. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/security-beefed-up-at-singhu-border-215677
22-02-2021||New Delhi||Sonia Gandhi writes to PM over rising fuel prices, says they are at ‘historic, unsustainable’ high||Writing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over “spiralling” fuel and gas prices, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Sunday accused the government of “profiteering” off “people’s misery” and demanded a rollback of the increase in prices.In a letter to Modi, she said the truth is that as GDP “nosedives”, the prices of gas, diesel and petrol continue to rise unchecked.“I write to you to convey every citizen’s anguish and deep distress regarding the spiralling fuel and gas prices. On one hand, India is witnessing systematic erosion of jobs, wages and household income. The middle class and those at the margins of our society are struggling. These challenges have been compounded by runaway inflation and an unprecedented rise in price of almost all household items and essential commodities,” the Congress chief said.“Sadly, in these distressing times, the government has chosen to profiteer off people’s misery and suffering,” Gandhi said.Petrol price on Saturday touched an all-time high of Rs 97 per litre in Mumbai while diesel rate crossed Rs 88-mark. This was the 12th straight day of price hike and the largest daily increase since oil companies started to revise rates on a daily basis in 2017.The increase pushed the petrol price to Rs 90.58 a litre in Delhi and to Rs 97 in Mumbai.Stressing that fuel prices are at an “historic and unsustainable” high, Gandhi said petrol has breached the Rs 100 per litre mark in many parts of the country and the surging price of diesel has added to the escalating woes of millions of farmers.“What baffles most citizens, is that these prices have been increased despite moderate prices of international crude oil. To put it in context, the crude oil price is nearly half of what it was during the UPA government’s tenure. Therefore, your government’s act of raising prices (continuously for 12 days till February 20th) is little less than a brazen act of profiteering,” she said.What is equally distressing is that despite being in power for almost seven years now, the government continues to blame previous regimes for its own economic mismanagement, she said in her letter to Modi.To set the record straight, domestic crude oil production has fallen to an 18-year low in 2020, Gandhi said.Governments are elected to ease the burden of people and at the very least, not work directly contrary to their interests, the Congress chief said.“I urge you to roll back these increases and pass on the benefit to our middle and salaried class, our farmers and poor and our fellow citizens. It is they who are battling an unprecedented economic slowdown, widespread unemployment, wage reductions and job losses, high prices and erosion of income,” she said.“I hope you will agree that it is time for your government to focus on solutions instead of looking for excuses. India deserves better,” Gandhi said.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday had said the Centre and state governments will have to together to work out a mechanism to bring retail rates of petrol and diesel to reasonable levels.

22-02-2021||New Delhi/Kolkata||CBI knocks at Abhishek Banerjee’s home, wife and sister-in-law get notice in coal theft case; TMC alleges political vendetta||A team from the Central Bureau of Investigation went to the Kolkata residence of Abhishek Banerjee, TMC MP and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, on Sunday to serve a notice to his wife and his sister-in-law to join its investigations into the coal pilferage case—a development that has further raised the political temperature in poll-bound West Bengal.The team handed over the notice issued by Investigation Officer Umesh Kumar, Additional Superintendent of Police in the CBI, in connection with the case of theft of coal from the mines of Eastern Coalfields Ltd in West Bengal in which Anup Manjhi is the alleged mastermind, sources said.The notice issued on Sunday asked Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Banerjee to remain present at her address on Harish Mukherjee Road on the same day “for the purpose of answering certain questions relating to the case”, they said.The CBI has also asked the TMC MP’s sister-in-law Menaka Gambhir to join the probe on Monday when she will be quizzed by the investigation team, the sources said.The Trinamool Congress and the BJP targeted each other over the CBI action.“At 2 PM today, the CBI served a notice in the name of my wife. We have full faith in the law of the land. However, if they think they can use these ploys to intimidate us, they are mistaken. We are not the ones who would ever be cowed down,” Abhishek Banerjee tweeted.Alleging political vendetta, the Trinamool Congress took a swipe at the ruling BJP at the Centre, saying “CBI is its only ally” that is left now.The BJP hit out at the TMC, accusing it of politicising the matter, and said the law will take its course.The central probe agency had on Friday carried out a fresh round of searches in connection with the case, they said.The CBI had registered an FIR in November last year against the alleged kingpin of the pilferage racket Manjhi alias Lala, Eastern Coalfield Ltd General Managers Amit Kumar Dhar (of then Kunustoria area now Pandaveswar area) and Jayesh Chandra Rai (Kajor area) besides ECL Chief of Security Tanmay Das, Area Security Inspector, Kunustoria Dhananjay Rai and SSI and security in-charge Kajor area Debashish Mukherjee.It is alleged that accused Manjhi Lala is involved in the illegal mining and theft of coal from leasehold mines of ECL in Kunustoria and Kajora areas, the sources said.The assembly elections are due in April-May in the state where the BJP has launched a vigorous campaign to oust the ruling TMC which had secured consecutive wins in 2011 and 2016 under its leader Mamata Banerjee.Abhishek Banerjee, a Lok Sabha member from Diamond Harbour constituency, wields considerable influence in the party and has been leading the Trinamool Congress’ counter-attack.The CBI has also summoned Binay Mishra, understood to be a close confidant of Abhishek Banerjee, in a separate case of cattle smuggling.The notice to Banerjee’s wife from the central agency comes a day before a court in Kolkata will hear a defamation case filed by Banerjee against Home Minister Amit Shah, who is spearheading the BJP campaign in the state.The court has summoned Shah to appear before it “personally or through a pleader” on Monday.Banerjee’s lawyer Sanjay Basu had claimed that Shah had made certain defamatory statements against the TMC MP on August 11, 2018, during a BJP rally at Mayo Road in Kolkata.In a statement on the CBI action, the TMC on Sunday said that people will give a befitting reply to the BJP during the polls.“So predictable. So desperate. All BJP allies have left them. So the only loyal allies are CBI and ED,” it stated.“CBI is the only ally of the BJP left,” the party said, adding that it was not scared and will fight it out.“The way BJP was targeting Abhishek for the last few days prove that they were up to something,” Trinamool Congress spokesperson and MP Sougata Roy said.The BJP alleged that the TMC was trying to politicise the matter.“If someone has committed any wrong, then the law will take its course. Those who are culprits should be punished. No one should try to politicise the matter,” BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya told PTI.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-knocks-at-abhishek-banerjees-home-wife-and-sister-in-law-get-notice-in-coal-theft-case-tmc-alleges-political-vendetta-215654
22-02-2021||New Delhi||3 held in Delhi over killing of Youth Cong leader in Punjab’s Faridkot||Three persons have been arrested in Delhi in connection with the killing of a 34-year-old Youth Congress leader in Punjab’s Faridkot on February 18, the Delhi Police said Sunday.The Punjab Police have been informed about the arrest of Faridkot residents -- Gurvinder Pal (the 32-year-old key accused), Sukhwinder Singh (23) and Saurabh Verma (21) in the killing of Gurlal Singh Bhalwan, a Delhi Police officer said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Manishi Chandra also said two other associates of the arrested accused are still at large and efforts are underway to nab them.They all are allegedly members of the Lawrence Vishnoi gang. Vishnoi is presently in Ajmer prison. The accused planned to kill Bhalwan because they suspected him to be a member of the rival Bhambhia gang, the senior police officer said.The officer said the conspiracy to kill Bhalwan was scripted by Goldy Brar, a Canada-based associate of Lawrence Vishnoi gang who has several cases registered against him.Brar runs an extortion racket in Canada from where he targets several prominent Punjab-based businessmen, he said.Police said Goldy instructed Gurvinder to kill Bhalwan on February 9. The Youth Congress leader wrote on Facebook on February 5 that he was planning to travel to Delhi join farmers’ protest against the three agricultural laws.   As per their plan, Gurvinder, accompanied by two shooters, closely followed Bhalwan when he travelled to the Singhu Border on February 9, the officer said. “However, the task could not be completed because of the size of the protesting crowd that was present,” he said. The trio then followed Bhalwan till Jantar Mantar in Delhi where Congress leaders and workers had assembled to protest against the farm laws, the DCP said, adding the trio left the trail since they found it difficult to dodge the security arrangements made by Delhi Police at the protest sites.Later, as directed by Goldy, Sukhvinder and Sourav started monitoring Bhalwan’s movements in Faridkot, the DCP said.“On February 18, when Bhalwan left his home, the duo started following him and communicated about his movements to Gurvinder, who had ferried the shooters from Chandigarh to Faridkot,” he said.According to police, around 12 shots were fired at Bhalwan when he was standing near his car after coming out from a friend’s shop at Faridkot’s Jubilee Chowk. The accused duo then fled on a motorcycle.He was rushed to a hospital, where he died during the treatment.Bhalwan was the president of the Faridkot district Youth Congress and a Zila Parishad member from Golewala, Punjab, police said.“On late Saturday night, we received information that three persons suspected to be involved in the murder of a political leader in Faridkot, Punjab, are expected to arrive at Sarai Kale Khan and would go to their hideouts in Uttar Pradesh. Accordingly, our teams conducted a raid and apprehended Gurvinder Pal, Sukhwinder Singh and Saurabh Verma. Two firearms and eight live cartridges were recovered from their possession,” he said.Goldy’s cousin Gurlal, a former state president of the Student Organisation of Punjab University (SOPU), was killed in a gangwar between the Lawrence Vishnoi and the Bhambhia gangs in Chandigarh in October 2020.

22-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||BJP thanks PM for bringing reforms in farm sector||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 21The ruling BJP’s on Sunday passed a resolution thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bringing “much-needed reforms” in the agriculture sector with the three farm laws.“The party believes that the laws were necessary for the welfare of India’s farmers and had been in demand for a long time,” stated the resolution moved by vice-president Raman Singh and seconded by Haryana leader Om Prakash Dhankar at the first meeting of the party’s new national office-bearers amid the ongoing agitation against the three laws.Addressing party’ functionaries, the Prime Minister in turn asked them to strengthen and expand the party with the motto of “nation first”, reach out to people and win their confidence. The Prime Minister said the BJP’s mission is not just to gain power but carry out “big and good work” for welfare of people and the country and this is how the organisation should be evaluated.“There is positive atmosphere in the country for development and everyone should work with the aim of nation first,” BJP general secretary Bhupendra Yadav said, quoting the PM.The BJP accused the Opposition, especially the Congress, for spreading “negativity and fear” in the country, including on farm laws and Covid. Raman Singh called the protests “politically motivated” and blamed Opposition parties for keeping alive the agitation even though “majority of farmers were in the favour of the laws”.“Farmers of the country are happy with the laws. The laws are being welcomed in different parts of the country. I think there is a conspiracy by Congress and Left parties to keep this agitation alive,” Singh said.  “The government is concerned about farmers and ready to make changes,” he said in response to a question.The resolution also praised the Prime Minister for his “able, sensitive, visionary and committed leadership” in handling the Covid crisis and “infusing in all its citizens the confidence to build an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, the “comprehensive and inclusive” union budget, and policies and programmes like the New Education Policy and the Swamitva Yojana.The resolution highlighted the Garib Kalyan Yojana during the pandemic, the diligent handling of the situation on the Line of Actual Control with China, the labour reforms and economic and political situation of the country, said Yadav.Yadav, who expressed confidence of BJP winning “at least 200 seats” in the upcoming election in high-profile West Bengal where it is engaged in a bitter fight with the ruling Trinamool Congress and returning to power in Assam, said “the NDA will form the government in Puducherry and likewise in Tamil Nadu with the AIADMK”.Will win "200 seats" in West Bengal, return to power in Assam, the NDA will form governments in Puducherry and Tamil Nadu, says BJPRegarding Kerala, Yadav said the party will “increase its support base” and “emerge as the third pillar” in the deeply polarised political scenario of the southern state. On whether the sky-rocketing fuel prices were also discussed at the meeting, Yadav said all issues related to people’s welfare were discussed.“The resolution was passed in mind the country’s current situation,” he said. Though the resolution does not mention the fuel prices, it talked of BJP’s political success in Assembly and local bodies elections saying “public mandate is with the government”.Party president JP Nadda also urged the cadres to strengthen the organisation and spread awareness about FPOs and ‘Bandhan yojana’. Next year, key BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are due for polls along with the epicentre of the farmers’ agitation, Punjab.Leaders from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan have already been asked to reach out to Jats and agrarian communities at the ‘khap’ levels and ensure that they do not feel alienated from the BJP. The “support” to farmers’ agitation from “non-Jats and Muslims” has the potential to upset the saffron party’s carefully crafted caste equations in UP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-thanks-pm-for-bringing-reforms-in-farm-sector-215604
