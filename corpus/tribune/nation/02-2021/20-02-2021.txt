The two celebrities who have been friends for over four decades would definitely have discussed several topics including the current political scenario in Tamil Nadu," said Snehan, MNMs state Youth Wing secretary.During the meeting that lasted for about half-an-hour, they could have definitely discussed politics, opined Snehan.Speaking to PTI he said there was a fair chance for the two to carry forward their discussions."Both wanted to usher in change for the prosperity of Tamil Nadu. One could not journey due to health conditions while the other is streaming ahead in politics," Snehan added.Recently, Haasan had said that he would meet the superstar after his campaign in Chennai.He insisted that he shared the feelings of Rajini’s fans, who were apparently disappointed as their Thalaiva could not make a political plunge."In spite of feeling a little disappointed, his health is of utmost importance to me. My Rajini must be healthy, wherever he may live," Haasan had said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/actor-kamal-haasan-calls-on-superstar-friend-rajini-215247
20-02-2021||Gopeshwar (Uttarakhand)||Uttarakhand glacier tragedy: 3 more bodies recovered from hydel project site, toll rises to 65||Three more bodies were recovered from the NTPC’s flood-ravaged Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project site on Saturday taking the toll in the February 7 glacial disaster in Uttarakhand to 65, officials said.The bodies were recovered from the desilting tank near the Tapovan project barrage on Saturday, NDRF Commandant P K Tiwari told PTI.Search operation at the project site has been underway on a war footing for more than 13 days since it bore the brunt of an avalanche triggered by a glacial burst over Rishiganga river in Chamoli district.The 13.2 MW Rishiganga hydel project was totally demolished in the avalanche while the Tapovan-Vishnugad hydropower project suffered extensive damage.With the recovery of three more bodies, the toll in the tragedy has gone up to 65 while 139 people are still missing.Meanwhile, Chamoli District Magistrate Swati S Bhadauria on Saturday asked the NTPC to press into service additional equipment and divert the course of Dhauliganga river to the other side so that its water does not flow through the barrage into Tapovan tunnel hampering sludge clearing efforts.River water flowing into the tunnel from the barrage has been a major headache for rescuers at the tunnel making the muck clearing operations even more challenging, Bhadauria said.Deploying additional equipment at the tunnel and diverting the course of the river will speed up the debris removal exercise which has been underway for more than 13 days, the DM said.She said rescue operations at the main project site in Raini have been completed.The DM added that the debris on the upper side of Rishiganga is now being scoured for any bodies that could be trapped, if any. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-glacier-tragedy-3-more-bodies-recovered-from-hydel-project-site-toll-rises-to-65-215246

20-02-2021||Mumbai||Lockdown unnecessary; double masking, micro-containment zones needed: Expert||A senior member of the Maharashtra government’s COVID-19 task force on Saturday said that lockdown is a draconian measure and has limited efficacy in countering the spread of the virus.According to task force member and endocrinologist Dr Shashank Joshi, promotion of “double masking” (wearing two layers of face covering) and formation of micro-containment zones could be effective.Maharashtra is witnessing a worrying uptick in infection numbers this month.“Lockdown is a draconian measure. It seems easy (to enforce) but it is an unwarranted measure. And there is no point in enforcing night curfews,” he said at a panel discussion.Asked what should the government do in the current situation, Joshi said, “Double masking, maintaining physical distancing, extreme precaution of hygiene and formation of micro-containment zone are the right measures.”He also said that the distribution of coronavirus vaccine should be decentralized.“There are some issues with the CoWin app which is slowing down the vaccination procedure. If the state gets more powers, it will be helpful to cover more and more people,” he said.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, technical advisor to the state government on the COVID-19 outbreak, said the vaccine on coronavirus is safe as over one crore people in the country have been vaccinated and nobody has died or developed serious complications.“The Centre should expedite the vaccination drive and give more say to the state governments in vaccine distribution,” he said.On Friday, only over 14,000 people were vaccinated in Maharashtra while new infections are rising in the state. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-unnecessary-double-masking-micro-containment-zones-needed-expert-215232

20-02-2021||Chandigarh||Implementation of farm laws will increase food prices: Chaduni||Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni on Saturday said food prices will increase like that of fuel if the Centre’s farm laws are implemented in the country.Describing the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s laws as a “dharma yudh”, the Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union chief exhorted all sections of society to be part of the movement. Chaduni was among several farmer leaders who addressed the first “kisan mahapanchayat” held here. The event was organised by the Naujwan Kisan Ekta. “We call it (agitation) ‘dharma yudh’. If agri-business laws are implemented, then the country’s foodgrain will go into the godowns of a few people. Then the food prices will go up the way petrol prices are rising now,” said Chaduni, seeking to assert the “adverse” impact of the legislations. “So, this is not a fight of farmers’ alone and we appeal to all sections of society that they should join this agitation. It is a movement to save the country. It is a ‘dharma yudh’,” said Chaduni.Chaduni said if the new farm laws were implemented, farmers will no longer remain owners of their land. The next thing which will be seen is companies doing farming on huge chunk of land, he stated.“If that happens, how will 65 per cent population which is dependent on agriculture survive? So, the question is of our survival, our future. If we lose this battle, then no one can save us from economic slavery,” he asserted.He accused the Centre of doling out financial relief to corporates and claimed the government could not spare money for relief to farmers in the shape of debt waiver.The Bharatiya Kisan Union leader said the question is not just of farmers but these three laws will impact cross section of people.Chaduni asked people not to vote for those who do not stand by farmers today. He asked farmers to stay at the protest sites near the Delhi borders for some days on rotational basis. Addressing the gathering, Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan slammed the BJP-led Centre for bringing the three “black” laws which are “against” the interest of farmers.He alleged that these farm laws will “benefit” the corporate sector.He asked the government to repeal the laws rather than sticking to its stand of putting these on hold for some period.Farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at the Delhi borders since late November, demanding the repeal of the farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for crops. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/implementation-of-farm-laws-will-increase-food-prices-chaduni-215229
20-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||BJP office-bearers to meet on Sunday, take stock of party’s poll preparedness||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 20Ahead of the important office-bearers meeting, BJP president JP Nadda on Saturday held consultations with general secretary (organisation) of states.On Sunday, the saffron party’s national office bearers will take stock of its prospects and resources ahead of upcoming polls in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Puducherry, Assam, and West Bengal.With Prime Minister Narendra Modi steadily building his government’s image around infrastructure development, the issue is expected to be among the key messages from the leadership amid the challenges being faced by the BJP on the front of rising petrol and diesel prices and farmers’ agitation.Senior leaders feel that apart from Assam – where the BJP has an incumbent government, it has “fairly good chance in other four Assemblies”, including Kerala, after “metro man” E Sreedharan’s endorsement to the party. Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah will address the first physical meeting called by the party president after the coronavirus-induced lock-down. They are also expected to give directions related to “pro-people” budget proposals and achievements and ways to counter the Opposition campaign against the farm laws.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the meeting of BJP national office-bearers at 10 am.At Saturday’s meeting called by national general secretary (Organisation) BL Santosh, sources said Nadda was apprised about organisational works undertaken by general secretaries of respective states. Nadda also chaired meeting of national general secretaries.Sunday’s day-long event is expected to see review meetings of states and their units. The party has also asked for reports on organisational matters from all states.While elections to five states will be the focus, they will be followed by the “real big ones” next year in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand.The epicentre of farmers’ agitation, Punjab, is also due for polls next year.After the debacle in Punjab local bodies elections, upcoming civic polls and by-polls in the state are also expected to be discussed.Leaders from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan have already been asked to reach out to Jats and agrarian communities at the ‘khap’ levels and ensure that they do not feel alienated from the BJP.The overwhelming success and support to ‘mahapanchayats’ appears to have added to the worries of the leadership over the party's prospects in Jat-dominated agrarian lands of northwest India.The “support” to farmers’ agitation from “non-Jats and Muslims” is threatening to upset the saffron-party’s carefully-crafted caste equations on the back of which it had been winning elections in Uttar Pradesh.After 2013 Muzzafarnagar riots, the Western UP region witnessed a deep polarisation with Hindu Jats, non-Jats and Dalits gravitating towards the BJP. The saffron party has been sweeping the Western UP and Jat-dominated regions on the back of this consolidation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-office-bearers-to-meet-on-sunday-take-stock-of-partys-poll-preparedness-215228
20-02-2021||Unnao (UP)||FIR against Cong leader Udit Raj for ‘misleading’ tweet on Unnao incident||Congress leader Udit Raj was booked Saturday for his tweet over the death of two girls in Unnao, with the police alleging he propagated fake news that the teenagers were raped and their bodies cremated against the will of their family.Superintendent of Police (SP) Anand Kulkarni said the claims made in the tweet were far from the facts emerging in the post-mortem report and the post was an attempt to create anger through “misleading” rumours.The post-mortem report did not confirm rape and the families had themselves cremated the bodies without any pressure, the SP said, adding that through the tweet, an effort was made to propagate concocted and fake news.An FIR has been registered with the Sadar Kotwali police station in this connection and further action is being taken, the SP said.In the tweet in Hindi, posted Friday, Udit Raj had stated, “Just spoke to former MP Savitri Bai Phule on telephone. Police let them meet the victims in Unnao after difficulty. The victims’ family members said the girls had been raped and the bodies were cremated against their wishes.”When contacted on Saturday, Udit Raj said he had tweeted on the issue after talking to Phule who had gone there. “I have also given reference of Phule in the tweet.”He then went on to attack the BJP government in the state.In Uttar Pradesh, cases are being lodged against all those raising their voices, he alleged. In Hathras, when “officials had spread the rumour”, no action was taken but “we are standing with the truth and no one can suppress our voice”, he said.Three girls, aged 15, 14 and 16, left their homes in Babuhara village in Asoha, around 36 km south of Lucknow, to collect fodder on Wednesday evening. As they did not return, their family members went out to search and found them in a field.The villagers informed the police and rushed the girls to a local hospital where two of them were declared brought dead. The third girl was rushed to the Unnao hospital and later referred to Kanpur.The last rites of the deceased girls were performed Friday morning amid tight security arrangements.The Unnao police has held two people in this connection, accusing them of murder over a one-sided love affair.

Dialogue should be initiated with the farmers and their problems must be solved," she further said.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said Prime Minister Modi had promised there will be settlement of dues pending on sugarcane. She asked the farmers about the payment of dues of sugarcane."The Prime Minister bought two airplanes at a higher price than the money pending for sugarcane payments. Modi had promised that sugarcane dues would be paid but it has not been done. A scheme to construct a Parliament building costing Rs 20,000 crore has been floated but sugarcane dues have not been paid. The Electricity bills are rising. The BJP government earned 21.5 lakh crore from diesel tax, but there is no account of that money. Why did the farmers not get this money."Priyanka said the farmers are in anguish. Rich billionaires have earned thousands of crores and distraught farmers are sitting on roads.She said, “Taxes being levied on government mandis will not be given in private mandis. As a result, government mandis will be discontinued in the near future. The second law would include contract farming. With this billionaires would buy the crop of farmers in an arbitrary manner. The Minimum Support Price mechanism will end. They [the government] will give the farmers' land to their rich businessmen friends.” --IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modis-arrogance-is-clear-to-everybody-priyanka-gandhi-215204
20-02-2021||New Delhi||AIIMS chief calls for PPP for large-scale rollout of COVID-19 vaccination programme||Terming the recent drop in COVID-19 cases in the country as a “small window of opportunity”, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria on Saturday called for a public-private partnership (PPP) for rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme at a large scale.Speaking at an AIMA event here, Guleria said the vaccine is the only weapon available to gain immunity and help reduce mortality rate due to the infectious disease.He noted that there was a need to put healthcare at the centrestage and not consider it only as a service sector.“As far as vaccination is concerned there is still a lot to do and I think there has to be more private public partnership,” the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director said.There is a need to gradually start opening up in order to cover large number of people, he noted.“Vaccinating health care workers and front line workers is probably the easy part as far as Phase 1 is concerned as you know who needs to be vaccinated. The number is not that large.“Once you start the process to vaccinate 27 crore individuals, in that scenario we must have a robust programme in place where you have the list of people to be vaccinated,” Guleria said.He further said: “We need to develop a mechanism where public and private sector actually start rolling out the vaccine at a large scale.”Guleria noted that there is an urgency to roll out the vaccine to a large number of people as there were dosages available due to some level of hesitancy in the healthcare and frontline workers.“I personally feel we have a window of opportunity available now because our cases are down, but this window can change anytime as we have seen in various parts of the world, specially with new variants coming up from different countries.“So we should not lose this moment and try to vaccinate a large number of our citizens which will be able to provide some level of protection as far as COVID-19 is concerned,” he said.He added that the country still doesn’t have an effective anti viral drug so the only weapon that can be actually utilised is the vaccine.“We have this small window before things may worsen and therefore we should take whatever vaccine we get and immunise ourselves so that we are able to decrease mortality and really have another spike in cases in the country,” Guleria emphasised.He noted that there has been lot of learning from the pandemic and there should be more emphasis on becoming self-reliant in the healthcare sector.“What we realised during the initial days of pandemic is that you have to do with stuff which is available in your own country. We had shortage of PPEs, N95 masks and even ventilators because they were not available in the country. Even diagnostics became a challenge. So we have to become self-reliant in many ways and we have to put health at the centrestage,” he noted.Guleria said that health is an important factor as it affects all areas including economy and livelihood.Rather than looking it only as a service sector, “healthcare should be looked as the centre which could be easily used to push the economy”, he said.He added that the country should not only aspire to become a medical research hub but also the patient care hub for the world.“I think India has the capacity to do that,” he said.Earlier, speaking the event, Apollo Hospitals vice chairperson Preetha Reddy lauded the government efforts in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.She said the country has shown the way to the entire world in dealing with the infectious disease.

It is the first country where India-made vaccines landed,” he said.He said India has looked beyond post-COVID economic recovery and India’s air travel bubble with the Maldives contributed significantly in reviving the tourism sector.“An extraordinarily deep partnership reaffirmed. Comprehensive talks with FM @abdulla_shahid. Deeply appreciate our close cooperation during Covid. Agreed to look beyond at post-pandemic economic recovery,” Jaishankar tweeted after the talks with Shahid.After the talks, Shahid said they had a productive meeting and the two sides discussed several issues, including projects being carried out with Indian financial support, Covid-19 pandemic and recovery, consular matters and multilateral cooperation.Later, speaking at an event at Ekuveni Stadium here Jaishankar offered a USD 40 million Line of Credit to the Maldives in a bid to boost the sports infrastructure of the country.He said that India acknowledges the high priority accorded by President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih to sports… and India is privileged to be a partner in that effort.“I am happy to announce that in order to support the development of sports infrastructure to fulfil the interests and aspirations of the Maldivian people, India has offered a standalone Line of Credit of USD 40 million for sports infrastructure in the Maldives,” Jaishankar said.He said the Maldivian people have tremendous sporting talent.“India is a trusted and reliable partner,” the minister said in his address.Jaishankar is visiting the Maldives at the invitation of Shahid. It is his second official visit to the Maldives, following his visit to attend the 5th Indian Ocean Conference in 2019.According to the Maldivian Foreign Ministry, Jaishankar, during his visit, will inaugurate some projects undertaken with Indian grant assistance and witness the exchange of several agreements and MoUs between the two countries.In the Maldives, Jaishankar will call on President Solih and have substantive discussions with the ministers for defence, finance, economic development and planning and infrastructure, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement in New Delhi earlier this week. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-time-tested-relationship-with-maldives-poised-to-take-quantum-jump-jaishankar-215192

20-02-2021||New Delhi||Centre, states need to work closely to boost economic growth: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday made a strong case for repealing archaic laws and making it easier to do business in India, stating that the Centre and states needed to work closely to boost economic growth.Addressing the sixth Governing Council meeting of Niti Aayog, the Prime Minister said the private sector should be given full opportunity to become a part of the government's Aatmanirbhar Bharat programme."The Centre and states should work together for the nation's progress...The government has to respect and give due representation to the private sector for economic progress," Modi said.He said the positive response to the Union Budget 2021-22 indicated that the country wanted to move forward on the path of development at greater speed.Modi said the initiatives taken by the government would provide opportunity to everyone to participate in nation building to its full potential.Referring to the farm sector, the Prime Minister said efforts should be made to produce agriculture items like edible oil and reduce their imports."This can be done by guiding farmers," he said, adding that the money being spent on imports could go to the accounts of farmers.The Prime Minister said the government policies would help farmers raise productivity and cut imports, adding that reforms needed to provide funds and technology for the farm sector.The Prime Minister also underlined the need for reducing compliance burden and repealing obsolete laws.He asked the states to form committees to reduce regulations which are no longer relevant in the wake of technology growth.Modi said states should attract investment using production-linked incentive scheme.He said the government is spending on infrastructure to boost demand and create jobs.The Prime Minister noted that bank accounts, free electricity and gas connection and proper vaccinations had brought changes in the lives of the poor.Stressing on the need to strengthen start-ups and MSMEs, Modi said, “Aatmanirbhar Bharat is not just to make India self-reliant, but also to meet the world’s needs.”He also urged states to form committees to celebrate India’s 75th Independence Day.The council of the apex body of Niti Aayog includes all chief ministers, lieutenant governors of Union Territories, several union ministers and senior government officials.

We oppose the government’s wrong policies affecting the common man,” he told PTI to a query on how he would function as Leader of the Opposition.Kharge, who became LoP this week following the retirement of Ghulam Nabi Azad, flagged the ongoing farmers’ stir demanding repeal of the three farm laws enacted by Parliament last year, and demanded that they be withdrawn.He suggested that the government come up with fresh proposals after withdrawing these controversial laws and refer them to a parliamentary standing committee for scrutiny.The senior Congress leader visited Kerala on Friday to address a public meeting organised in Kollam as the Congress-led UDF’s ‘Aiswarya Kerala Yatra’, led by senior party leader Ramesh Chennithala, arrived in Kollam.The yatra is being organised to reach out to people ahead of the assembly polls likely to be held in April-May.Kharge, a Gandhi family loyalist, said his party leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi had asked him to “highlight the issues of the poor people” on the floor of the House.“We raise the issues (in Parliament) not to become famous. We take up the issues affecting the poor. Somebody should talk,” the senior Congress leader said.The 78-year-old veteran leader, with over 50 years’ experience in politics, urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP to listen to the voices of agitating farmers and address their grievances.He also rapped the government over the increasing fuel prices, saying they were doing “a great injustice” to the people.“Petrol prices are at an all-time high, while international crude oil prices have touched a record low. By hiking prices day by day, the central government is doing a great injustice to the people of this country,” he said.

Channel editors to ensure proper editorial control so that investigation is not hampered,” Justice Singh said, posting the matter for further hearing in March.The HC also asked the 22-year-old climate activist to ensure that people connected to her didn’t indulge in unnecessary or scandalising messages and the parties didn’t go on a maligning course during the investigation. On behalf of Ravi, senior advocate Akhil Sibal wanted the court to order certain TV channels to take down reports having reference to the “so-called WhatsApp conversations” from their online platforms and restrain them from disseminating any information of the probe which was not part of public record.However, the court refused to order removal of any such content at this stage with regard to the probe into the FIR against Ravi for her alleged involvement in sharing a toolkit backing farmers’ protest. “There is no doubt that regulation of content has been a very contested issue across the world and India is no exception to it,” the HC noted. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/media-coverage-prejudicial-in-disha-ravi-case-delhi-high-court-214985

Four of the five were awarded posthumously for acts of “bravery”.The clash between the PLA and the Indian Army occurred on June 15 last year and it is the first time the PLA has publically stated a number —- only of the gallantry awardees.

Today, we got information that she along with her supplier Prabir was reaching the spot to hand over the drugs to the purchasers,” the officer said.Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak. Rs Sun Tzu, The Art of War!! pic.twitter.com/8xMxYQ94Rf  A team of policemen in eight vehicles surrounded Goswami’s car and made the arrests, he said.“An investigation into the matter is underway. We are trying to find out whether she is involved in any drug racket,” the officer said.The BJP said that it suspects the police’s role in the drugs recovery but if Goswami was wrong, the law should take its course.“We had earlier seen that the state police had named several BJP activists in arms cases. I do not have much information about this incident that is why I will not be able to say more. Pamela is a young girl. If she has done anything wrong, the law will take its course,” BJP MP Locket Chatterjee said.State BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said, “I do not know whether this is planted. The model code of conduct is yet to come into effect and the police are still under the state government. So, anything can be possible. We need to see whether the packets were planted inside her vehicle and her bag. I am not sure.”State minister and senior Trinamool Congress leader Chandrima Bhattacharya slammed the BJP and said it was a shame that even women from the party were found involved in such illegal acts.“Earlier, we saw the involvement of several BJP leaders in child trafficking, and now drug trafficking.

20-02-2021||New Delhi||Toolkit case: Delhi court sends Disha Ravi to 3-day judicial custody||A Delhi court Friday sent climate activist Disha Ravi, arrested for allegedly being involved in sharing a “toolkit” on social media related to the farmers’ protest, to three-day judicial custody.Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Akash Jain sent Ravi, 21, to jail after Delhi Police produced her before the court on expiry of her five-day custodial interrogation.Police said that her custodial interrogation was not required for the time being and the agency may seek her further interrogation once her co-accused—Shantanu Mukul and Nikita Jacob—join the interrogation.Police said Ravi was evasive during her previous interrogation and tried to shift blame on the co-accused.Mukul and Jacob have been asked to appear before the investigating agency on February 22, the agency told the court.The defence lawyer opposed the police plea and urged the court to release Ravi.He further said that there was an apprehension of tampering of the evidence by police as the “case diary is not properly made...and in volume form. There’s no ground to keep her in any custody, police custody or judicial custody. I (Ravi) ought to be released right now”.The court was also informed that the accused has moved a bail application which will come up for hearing on Saturday.Last Sunday, the court had sent Ravi to five-day police custody, after it said her custodial interrogation was required to probe an alleged larger conspiracy against the government of India and to ascertain her alleged role relating to the Khalistan movement.Ravi, arrested by a Cyber Cell team of the Delhi Police from Bengaluru on Saturday, was produced before a court here and police had sought her seven days’ custody.While seeking her custody, the police had told the court that the activist had allegedly edited the “toolkit” on February 3 and many other people were involved in the matter.A “toolkit” is a document created to explain any issue. It also provides information on what one needs to do to address the issue. This might include information about petitions, details about protests and mass movements.Earlier, the Delhi Police had asked Google and some social media giants to provide information about email id, URLs and certain social media accounts related to the creators of the “toolkit” shared by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and others on Twitter in connection with the farmers’ protest.The Cyber Cell had lodged an FIR against “pro-Khalistan” creators of the “toolkit” for waging a “social, cultural and economic war against the government of India”.The case against unnamed persons was registered on charges of criminal conspiracy, sedition and various other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The “toolkit” was aimed at spreading disaffection and ill-will against the government of India and creating disharmony among various social, religious and cultural groups, the police had claimed.

The militant, identified as Saqib, can be seen pulling out an assault rifle hidden inside his ‘pheran’, a loose over-garment worn during winters, and pumping bullets at them at close range.The attacker can be seen fleeing from the spot as people scatter around in horror. “We have identified the militant and we will soon catch hold of him,” Director-General of Jammu and Kashmir Police Dilbagh Singh told PTI here.The two policemen were rushed to SMHS hospital. Constable Suhail was the first one to succumb while his colleague, constable Mohammed Yusuf, lost the battle of life as he was being wheeled into the operation theatre, police said.Immediately after the incident, police teams rushed to the area and took into their possession recordings from CCTVs installed by shops and houses. This led them to identify the militant as Saquib from Barzulla area in the city. His affiliations were not immediately known.This is the second attack in the city in three days.On Wednesday evening, militants shot at and injured the son of a popular eatery owner in the city’s high security Durganag area.“We have identified some people and they are being questioned by the police. I am sure the case will be cracked soon,” Singh said.The attack in the city came as a 24-member delegation of envoys from various countries visited Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday to assess the ground situation in the union territory.

20-02-2021||Washington||'Touchdown confirmed': Indian-American scientist helps NASA land rover on Mars||As Perseverance, the NASA rover, landed on the Martian surface Friday, millions of miles away in the US space agency’s control room, a woman’s voice rang out: “Touchdown confirmed!”         The announcement was from Indian-American scientist Swati Mohan who leads the guidance, navigation, and control operations of NASA’s Mars 2020 mission. In her role as flight controller, Mohan played a pivotal role in the landing of the historic craft.Mohan was the first to confirm that the rover had successfully touched down on the Martian surface after surviving a particularly tricky plunge through the atmosphere of the Red Planet.“Touchdown confirmed! Perseverance safely on the surface of Mars, ready to begin seeking signs of past life,” Mohan announced, prompting her colleagues at NASA to fist-bump and break into celebrations.Also read: NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter could pave way for future rover-drone tandem missionsNASA’s astrobiology rover Perseverance makes historic Mars landingMohan, who emigrated from India to the US when she was only a year old, said the Guidance, Navigation, and Controls Operations (GN&C) are the “eyes and ears” of the spacecraft.Commenting on her team’s role in the current mission, Mohan said their job during the cruise phase heading towards Mars was to figure out how the spacecraft is oriented, and make sure it is pointed correctly in space—“solar arrays to sun, antenna to Earth, and maneuver the spacecraft to get it where we want to go”, she is quoted as saying in her bio page on the NASA website.There were “seven minutes of terror” leading to the entry, descent, and landing on Mars, she said. GN&C determines the position of the spacecraft and commands the manoeuvers to help it land safely.Congratulations to @DrSwatiMohan, Guidance, Navigations and Control Operations Lead for @NASAPersevere.Proud moment for India and the world. Thrilled to see @NASAJPL and its scientists break new frontiers in science and expand our scope of knowledge. pic.twitter.com/XuqGq0BsZ8  “As the team’s operations lead, I am the primary point of communication between the GN&C subsystem and the rest of the project.“I am responsible for the training of the GN&C team, scheduling the mission control staffing for GN&C, as well as the policies/procedures the GN&C uses in the mission control room,” Mohan noted.Raised in the Northern Virginia-Washington DC metro area, she completed her bachelor’s degree from Cornell University in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering, and her M.S. and Ph.D from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Aeronautics/Astronautics. It’s not clear how old she is.Over the course of her career with NASA, Mohan has worked on the Cassini mission to Saturn and GRAIL, a pair of formation flown spacecraft to the Moon, and has been a mainstay with the Mars 2020 mission since its beginning in 2013.Meet the scientist who talked us all through the landing expertly and said those magic words "touchdown confirmed" @DrSwatiMohan 🎉🎉#CountdownToMars #Perseverance pic.twitter.com/TZA3B5MFg0  Mohan said she got interested in space after watching the popular TV show “Star Trek” when she was nine.“Seeing the beautiful depictions of the new regions of the universe that they were exploring. I remember thinking ‘I want to do that. I want to find new and beautiful places in the universe.’ The vastness of space holds so much knowledge that we have only begun to learn,” she had told NASA.Mohan said her passion for space increased further when she took her first physics class at the age of 16.“I was lucky enough to have a great teacher, and everything was so understandable and easy. That was when I really considered engineering, as a way to pursue space,” she added.

20-02-2021||Beijing||4 Chinese soldiers were killed in Galwan Valley clash, acknowledges China||Four Chinese soldiers were killed during a fierce hand-to-hand battle with the Indian Army in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh in June last year, the PLA acknowledged for the first time on Friday, eight months after the biggest military confrontation between the two neighbours in over five decades.China’s military authorities have honoured two officers and three soldiers, including four who received the awards posthumously, for defending the country’s western border, the official Xinhua news agency reported, quoting the The People’s Liberation Army Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese military.Five Chinese frontier officers and soldiers stationed in the Karakoram Mountains have been recognised by the Central Military Commission of China (CMC) for their sacrifice in the border confrontation with India, which occurred in the Galwan Valley in June 2020, the PLA Daily said.The CMC is headed by Chinese President Xi Jinping, also General Secretary of the ruling Communist Party of China.Also read: 10th round of commander-level talks between India and China tomorrowThe title of “border-defending hero” was conferred on Battalion Commander Chen Hongjun posthumously, while Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan and Wang Zhuoran received first-class merit. Qi Fabao, who was seriously injured in the skirmish, received the title of “hero regiment commander for defending the border,” the Xinhua report said.Three PLA soldiers were killed in the combat, while another soldier died while crossing the icy river when he went to support his army mates.Asked why China chose to reveal the casualties suffered during the Galwan incident after over eight months, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said, “the report has been revealed to give the truth to the public because the truth is long awaited and is necessary for the people to know the true story.”India has said that 20 of its soldiers were killed in the fierce hand-to-hand combat on June 15 in Galwan Valley, an incident that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in over four decades.While China acknowledged casualties, it did not disclose details.“These heroes will along will be remembered by the Chinese people. Their sacrifices made to defend our territory will never be forgotten by the Chinese people,” she said.“We all know that conflict broke out in Galwan in June last year and responsibility does not rest with Chinese side,” Hua claimed.Bearing in mind the overall interests of relations between the two countries and the two militaries, China has “exercised a high degree of restraint to cool down and ease the situation, which shows its magnanimity and high sense of responsibility as a major country,” she said.“We hope that the border issue will be put in a proper place in bilateral relations, and the Indian side will make joint efforts with us to properly settle the relevant issue and safeguard overall bilateral relations.India is an important neighbour, and the restoration of a sound, stable China-India relationship serves the common aspiration and interests of both peoples. “We hope the Indian side can work with China in the same direction,” she said.Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, Spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of National Defence said that China’s position on resolving the China-India border issue is clear, consistent and sincere.“China is always committed to resolving disputes through dialogue and negotiation, maintaining the general situation of the relations between the two sides, promoting the cooling and easing of the situation, and restoring the peace and tranquility in the China-Indian border areas as soon as possible,” Ren said in a statement.Asked whether the details of the Galwan incident revealed by China today will impact Saturday’s 10th round of Commanders-level talks to discuss further disengagement of troops, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said these are two separate issues.“Through diplomatic and military channels of the two sides are in communications in completing the disengagement smoothly,” she added.“We hope the Indian side will bear in mind the general interest of bilateral relations and bring the ties to the right track. What we released is just the facts and the truth,” she said.The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong Lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.The Chinese soldiers used stones, nail-studded sticks, iron rods and clubs in carrying out brutal attacks on Indian soldiers after they protested the erection of a surveillance post by China on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Galwan.The PLA Daily claimed that the Indian soldiers attacked the Chinese military personnel with steel tubes and cudgels and threw stones.This is the first time China has acknowledged casualties and details of these officers and soldiers’ sacrifice, four of whom died when dealing with the Indian military’s “illegal trespassing” of the Galwan Valley.The Russian official news agency TASS reported on February 10 that 45 Chinese servicemen were killed in the Galwan Valley clash. According to an American intelligence report last year, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.The Galwan incident was the biggest confrontation between the two militaries after their 1967 clashes in Nathu La when India lost around 80 soldiers while over 300 Chinese army personnel were killed.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.The official Global Times said the PLA Daily while acknowledging the Galwan Valley casualties stated that the four soldiers were killed fighting the “foreign military” without referring to the Indian Army.The admission of the casualties by the PLA coincides with the ongoing disengagement of troops by both sides at the North and South banks of the Pangong Lake, the most contentious part of the standoff which began last year.
