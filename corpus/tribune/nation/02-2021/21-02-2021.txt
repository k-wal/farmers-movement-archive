21-02-2021||New Delhi||Jaishankar to talk defence, development with Mauritius||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar left Maldives for Mauritius on Sunday after discussing a $50 million defence line of credit (LoC) agreement with Defence Minister Mariya Didi.Jaishankar also witnessed the signing of a project execution contract for construction of roads in the southern-most island atoll Addu which, he said, underscored the importance of connectivity in India-Maldives ties.The last visit of an external affairs minister was in August 2018 when Sushma Swaraj visited Mauritius for the World Hindi Conference.Mauritius PM Pravind Jagnauth last visited India on a private visit along with his spouse in December 2019, the visit being symbolic since it came just after his victory in general elections. India has been sensitive to keeping Mauritius and the Maldives in its zone of influence. India had planned a landing of troops under Operation Lal Dora to help the present PM’s father Anerood Jugnauth in 1983. Four years later, Indian troops actually landed in the Maldives to crush a coup attempt against then President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.Jaishankar’s visit is aimed at maintaining India’s lead as Mauritius’ largest development cooperation partner. Besides discussing new projects, the foreign minister will review progress in two marquee projects. One is the Metro Express project, the largest infrastructure project by India, and the second is the ENT hospital that was useful during the pandemic.India is also a partner of preference for Mauritius in meeting its defence requirements and a regular supplier of defence equipment, vessels and aircraft.During the pandemic, Mauritius was amongst the largest beneficiaries of India’s Covid-related assistance. India supplied 13 tonnes of essential medicines, 5 lakh HCQ tablets and 10 tonnes of Ayurvedic medicines. Under VaccineMaitri, Mauritius received one lakh doses of Covishield vaccine from India. Mass vaccination began on January 26 as a symbolic move coinciding with India’s 72nd Republic Day.India had also assisted in dealing with an oil spill on its south-east coast in August last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-to-talk-defence-development-with-mauritius-215693

21-02-2021||New Delhi||Herd immunity difficult to achieve: AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria||Herd immunity is “very difficult” to achieve and one should not think of it in “practical terms” in India, especially in the times of “variant strains” of COVID-19 and “waning immunity”, claimed AIIMS director Randeep Guleria on Sunday.Guleria was speaking at the ongoing edition of Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF) in a session on his book “Till We Win: India’s Fight Against The Covid-19 Pandemic”—co-authored by public policy and health systems expert Chandrakant Lahariya and renowned vaccine researcher and virologist Gagandeep Kang.      “Herd immunity is something that is going to be very, very difficult to achieve and it is something one should not really think of in practical terms... because the variant strains and varying immunity with times can lead to a chance where people may have reinfection or get infection again,” the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director said.“And one should also remember that large number of people have had mild infections and we do know that those with mild infection tend to have less antibodies production, their antibodies tend to wane over a period of time,” he added.Experts say herd immunity is said to have been developed in a population segment if at least 50-60 per cent of those are found to have the presence of antibodies in a sero-prevalence survey.Herd immunity implies that in any set of people in a community, after becoming affected by the virus, a lot many of them become immune to it, on account of antibodies developed in response to it. And, hence, such people become a protective layer between the infected person and unaffected people, thereby breaking the chain of viral transmission.Guleria here also gave the example of Brazilian city Manaus which even after having achieved the herd immunity in October is now battling the second COVID-19 wave.“They (Brazil) had claimed that they got heard immunity with almost 70 per cent of the population being protected because of the past infection, and yet because of the Brazilian variant and waning immunity a large number of people got infected again. And now they are in a very bad situation because of resurgence of cases,” he noted.Here, he also asserted that no sero surveys done so far has suggested India being “anyway near” achieving the herd immunity.Over 21 per cent of the population, aged 10 years and above, showed evidence of past exposure to COVID-19 in the Indian Council of Medical Research”s (ICMR) latest national sero-survey out on February 4.Stressing on the importance of vaccination, which he said is essential in India’s fight against the coronavirus, he said they too will change with time tackling not only the “emerging variants” but giving more robust immunity lasting for a longer period of time.“What we have today is not the only vaccine, we will have better vaccines as time moves on and as research moves on. But right now we should take what we have if we want to really make sure that the situation in our country does not deteriorate,” he added.The JLF, now in its 14th edition, features over 300 speakers and performers representing around 25 Indian and 18 international languages and over 23 nationalities.        Some of the big names making it to the festival this year include the likes of American linguist Noam Chomsky, 2020 Booker Prize winner Douglas Stuart, Nobel Laureates Joseph Stiglitz and Malala Yousafzai, Microsoft Corporation co-founder Bill Gates, and actor-author Priyanka Chopra. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/herd-immunity-difficult-to-achieve-aiims-director-randeep-guleria-215673

This is also corroborated by the CCTV footage. Hence, the allegation of misbehaviour by him simply does not arise,” Air India said in the statement.The CCTV footage also nullifies the passenger’s allegation of bribes being asked for and snatching of a mobile phone, it said.According to Air India, during check-in at the Delhi airport counter, Bhaker told its check-in employees that she was carrying an Air Pistol and a 0.22-bore gun.“She was advised by our counter personnel to get the documents, mandatory to carry arms and ammunition, verified by Air India security officials,” said the statement.Dear Ms BhakerOur Delhi Airport team has confirmed that the official at our counter had only sought for valid documents as per rules for carriage of your weapon on board. (1/3) https://t.co/HCV87u6eha  After verification of documents shown by Bhaker, the security officials informed her that the document required for exemption of payment of handling charge for carriage of arms, as per laid down norms, is not there. And, they said fixed charges for the carriage of arms would have to be paid, the airline clarified in the statement.It was explained to Bhaker that the document for exemption shown by her was not “valid” as it was signed only by the assistant secretary of the National Rifle Association. As per rules, details of which are available on the Air India website, signature of only the secretary or president of a bonafide association is recognised for waiver of the charges, Air India said.“Subsequently, the applicable charges – that is Rs 5,000 along with 5 per cent GST; for two, a total Rs 10,200 – were conveyed to Bhaker, who requested for 10-15 minutes from our personnel to procure the required document for waiver of charges for carriage of her arms on board,” said the statement.The moment she furnished the required document to the Air India check-in and security personnel, her baggage including the arms were accepted for carriage, the statement said.Air India said though the DGCA permit allowed her carriage of arms from February 20, in view of the Rifle Association certificate with bonafide signature, it extended courtesy to have her on board with the arms on February 19 itelf.“Subsequently, Bhaker with her mother proceeded for their security check and were facilitated to board the aircraft,” the airline added.Air India has always encouraged and has the highest respect for sports and sportspersons, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-india-denies-manu-bhakers-allegation-of-harassment-at-delhi-airport-215668

Naval divers have also made a survey to observe the area and its depth.SDRF personnel at Pang and other areas along Rishiganga lake are also closely monitoring the flow of the Rishiganga river. In addition to this, alert sensors have also been set up along the river.The lake appears to be 750 metre long and has huge quantity of water which can pose a big threat to the downstream areas of Rishiganga river, SDRF officials said.Significantly, there is a considerable discharge from the lake also which is being seen as a relief, DGP Ashok Kumar said.The government has sent scientists of the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology and Geological Survey of India to the lake area where they will prepare a report for future action.

Unless the private sector is energised enough, unless it is facilitated enough, India is just losing a very big opportunity,” Sitharaman said here during the interactive session organised by the Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce.Sitharaman underlined that the nation’s growing and aspiring needs and demands across the various sectors cannot be served just by the state government and central governments put together.According to the finance minister, the coronavirus vaccine was a big example of government-private partnership.“To be a world leader with that specific India touch, which is more humane, more about bringing everybody together, which is peaceful, which actually wishes that the world progresses for everybody’s good.“If that is the way India approaches its responsibility, that will be incomplete unless the government plays the role, it is expected to play the facilitator and unless the private sector plays the role of a key driver. So that’s the message this budget has talked about,” the finance minister told the gathering.Sitharaman noted that the budget was about setting the path for the decade.She pointed out that the stimulus package, which largely depended on the government’s borrowing, was aimed at sectors which provided the multiplying effect such as infrastructure, the budget funding, where public expenditure was going to be undertaken.Observing that the Centre has clearly funded stimulus with the borrowed money, she said the government was aware of fiscal management.“Debt to GDP, another indicator which is important for a healthy economy, has to be carefully managed in such a way that sooner in a sense, in a reasonable time frame, the fiscal deficit will also be kept under the healthy level and not let unattended for decades together,” Sitharaman pointed out.The finance minister said the government wanted uninterrupted yet sustainable growth.The event saw a galaxy of tycoons and industry leaders such as Wipro founder Azim Premji, former director of Infosys TV Mohandas Pai, noted cardiac surgeon Dr Devi Prasad Shetty and president and chairman of Volvo Group India Kamal Bali Premji, in his speech, emphasised on taking along the private sector in the COVID-19 vaccination drive to speed up the inoculation process whereas Pai said the nation wants the companies to set up their industries within the country instead of becoming a digital colony.He also suggested giving away tablets to the children from weaker sections so that they were not left out in the ‘Digital India’ mission. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/budget-is-about-govt-role-as-facilitator-pvt-sector-as-key-driver-of-growth-fm-sitharaman-215662
21-02-2021||New Delhi||IT detects tax evasion after raids on group running largest Srinagar hospital||The Income Tax Department has detected multiple instances of alleged tax evasion after it raided a business group that runs the “biggest private” multi-speciality hospital in Srinagar, the CBDT said on Sunday.The searches were launched on Friday, and seven premises including four residential were covered.While an official statement issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) did not name the entity raided, official sources in the department identified it as the group that runs the Noora hospital located in Zainakote, Srinagar.The statement said Rs 82.75 lakh cash and jewellery and bullion worth Rs 35.7 lakh were seized “as the concerned persons from whose custody these were found were not able to explain the same”.The department has also “sealed” a bank locker found during the raids.The core business of the group included running of the over 100-bed multi-speciality hospital, real estate and trading of household consumables, it said.“The group is in the practice of buying large chunks of lands in piecemeal and aggregating them. Thereafter, it develops the land and carves out plots and sells them. Evidence showing more than 50 per cent of consideration (over and above the registered value of the property) received in cash from buyers, has been seized during the search operation,” the CBDT said.Such sale consideration received in cash, it alleged, has “never” been offered to tax.“The group has made unaccounted property transactions of more than Rs 100 crore in cash since finanical year 2013-14,” the CBDT said.“The payments/investments made through banking channels by the buyers of plots are also under investigation as prima-facie verification has shown that the investments have not been made using tax-paid income,” it alleged.Thus, taxes would be leviable not only on the seller group but the buyers also, depending on the facts of the cases, it added.“There is substantial default of TDS on almost all purchases and sales of land and plots,” the Board, that frames policy for the tax department, said.The action also “revealed substantial evasion of stamp duty due to the government on cash paid as sale consideration over and above the registered value of the property”.“The information in this regard will be shared with the J-K UT authority for levy of stamp duty on the entire sale consideration, as evident from the seized documents and notification of circle rates as per the prevailing market rates,” it said.The CBDT claimed that individuals linked to the group “have taken a number of plots/land as gifts from various unrelated individuals and they have not shown any income on this score...even though the same is chargeable to tax in the hands of the doner as income from other sources”.“The cases of the donors are also under investigation from the perspective of evasion of income tax,” the statement said.Describing another instance of alleged tax evasion, the CBDT said “one of the taxpayers of this group engaged in trading of household consumables has made cash purchases of these items worth Rs 2 crore in 6 months (FY 2019-20) in violation of tax provisions which mandate payment of more than Rs 10,000 at a time through banking channels only”.“Evidence of various benami properties has also been unearthed and seized during the search. The same is under investigation,” it said.“Suppression of receipts from the running of the hospital is under investigation. The average turnover shown by the hospital is around Rs 10-12 crore since FY 2015-16, however, seized evidence shows actual receipts to be at least four times more,” the CBDT claimed.Evidence showing cash payments of Rs 3 crore, made to various doctors in the current year, has been seized during the search, it claimed.

21-02-2021||New Delhi||Sreedharan’s impact likely to be ‘minimal’; BJP not serious contender in Kerala: Tharoor||With E Sreedharan throwing his hat in the political ring by deciding to join the BJP, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Sunday said the technocrat is likely to have a “minimal” impact on the upcoming Kerala Assembly polls, and asserted that the BJP is not a serious contender except in a few seats in the state.Tharoor also said it will be very difficult for the BJP to improve upon its performance of winning one seat in the 2016 Assembly polls and the high point of Sreedharan’s impact on Kerala elections will turn out to be the announcement of joining the BJP itself.In an interview with PTI, Tharoor said he was surprised at the announcement that Sreedharan was going to enter the political fray and join the BJP.He said Sreedharan’s entry came as a surprise to him because the technocrat had a long innings executing engineering projects, not making or implementing policies in a fractious democracy. “It’s a very different world,” he added.Asked what kind of impact Sreedharan could have on the Kerala Assembly polls, the MP from Thiruvananthapuram said, “Since he has no political background or experience, I think his impact is likely to be minimal.”    “When I joined politics at 53, I thought I had left it too late to make the kind of impact I felt I was capable of. What can I say about someone who is 88?” Tharoor said.On whether Sreedharan’s entry will make the Kerala polls a three-way contest and the BJP will emerge as a serious contender alongside the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF), he said the BJP is not a serious contender at all except in a handful of seats, and it will be very difficult for the party to improve upon the one seat it won last time.“The high point of the impact (of Sreedharan) will turn out to be this announcement itself,” the 64-year-old former Union minister said.Sreedharan, who recently announced that he will enter the political fray by joining the BJP, had told PTI last week that he will contest the Assembly elections if the BJP wants and will also be open to chief ministership if the party asks.Known as the ‘Metro man’ and for completing big infrastructure projects, the 88-year-old technocrat has also said his main aim is to help the BJP come to power in Kerala.Sreedharan’s entry into the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is being seen as a major boost for the party in election-bound Kerala. The state has been ruled by the LDF and the Congress-led UDF alternately for the past many years.Tharoor said the UDF has the talent, the experience and the creative energy to build a new narrative for the future of Kerala.“What I am working on is intended to be, above all, a ‘people’s manifesto’—not just about what the Congress will do for the people of Kerala, but what the people of Kerala want and expect the Congress to do for them,” said Tharoor, who has been entrusted by the Congress in bringing various pertinent issues into the UDF’s election manifesto.“That is why it is so important to seek suggestions and inputs from the people, about what they judge to be lacking in their lives that a receptive and inclusive government would seek to provide,” he said.The end product should reflect a vision for 21st century Kerala, and lay out some practical directions for the state to unleash its true potential and develop into a progressive and self-reliant place, offering abundant opportunities to its people, especially the youth, Tharoor said.“I see our ‘Talk To Tharoor’ campaign as an opportunity for the UDF to serve the people of Kerala through creative ideas, responsible governance and the courage and confidence to rise to the aspirations of our people,” he said.It is sad but true that Keralites flourish everywhere in the world they go to, more easily than in Kerala, Tharoor argued.“We must remove the obstacles that prevent Keralites from thriving in Kerala. The UDF has the  talent, the experience and the creative energy to build a new narrative for the future,” he said.The polls for the 140-member Kerala Assembly are likely to be held in April-May this year.

21-02-2021||New Delhi||Chandrayaan-3 launch delayed further to 2022||Chandrayaan-3, India’s third mission to Moon, is likely to be launched in 2022, ISRO chief K Sivan has said.The COVID-19 lockdown has hit several projects of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) including Chandrayaan-3, which was scheduled to be launched in late 2020, and Gaganyaan, the country’s first manned space mission.Unlike its predecessor, Chandrayaan-3 will not have an orbiter.“We are working on it. It is the same configuration like Chandrayaan-2, but it will not have an orbiter. The orbiter launched during Chandrayaan-2 will be used for Chandrayaan-3. With that we are working on a system and mostly the launch will be next year in 2022,” Sivan told PTI.Chandrayaan-2, aimed at landing a rover on the unchartered Lunar South Pole, was launched on July 22, 2019 on board the country’s most powerful geosynchronous launch vehicle.However, the lander Vikram hard-landed on September 7, 2019, crashing India’s dream to become the first nation to successfully land on the lunar surface in its maiden attempt. Chandrayaan-3 is critical for ISRO as it will demonstrate India’s capabilities to make landing for further interplanetary missions.He said ISRO is targeting December to launch the first unmanned mission under the Gaganyaan project. The mission was originally scheduled to launch in December last year. It will be followed by another unmanned mission and the third leg is the main module, he said.Gaganyaan envisages to send three Indians to space by 2022. The four test pilots selected for the mission are currently undergoing training in Russia. When asked about the launch of the third module of Gaganyaan—the manned mission—Sivan said, “A lot of technology needs to be demonstrated. We will decide on the time (of the manned mission) after checking whether all the technology is perfect.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chandrayaan-3-launch-delayed-further-to-2022-215650

21-02-2021||Pune||New curbs announced in Pune amid rise in COVID-19 cases||In view of a spike in COVID-19 cases in Pune, the district administration has decided to enforce certain curbs, including restriction on movement of people from 11 pm to 6 am for non-essential activities, a senior official said on Sunday.Schools, colleges and private coaching classes will remain closed till February 28, while hotels and restaurants will have to shut their establishments by 11 pm every day, Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao told reporters.Creation of micro-containment zones, re-setting up of COVID-19 care centres, increased contact-tracing and testing, and stricter implementation of norms for weddings and other social events are some of the steps which will be taken to stem the spread of the viral infection, he said.The decision to bring back some restrictions was taken in a meeting chaired by Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, who is also the guardian minister of Pune, on Sunday, he said.On Saturday, the Pune division reported 998 new cases of coronavirus and nine deaths due to the viral infection. The COVID-19 tally in the division stood at 5,14,319 and the death toll at 11,698, as per official figures.Rao said for the last three months, the situation in the district was under control. But, now given the rise in COVID-19 cases, some decisions have been taken.There will be restrictions on the movement of people for non-essential activities between 11 pm and 6 am from Monday, he said.“Essential activities like newspaper distribution, milk and vegetable supply, and hospital emergencies have been excluded from the curbs,” he said.Hotels, bars and restaurants will have to close down by 11 pm from Monday onwards, he said.“The decision has been taken as a precaution to control the movement of people who are roaming around unnecessarily,” he said.Rao said as far as the positivity rate is concerned, Pune district is at 12thposition in the state.“The average positivity rate in the district has now reached 10 per cent. Fifteen days ago, it was 4 to 5 per cent and now there is a need to revamp the standard operating procedures in the district,” he said.As a precautionary measure, schools and colleges in the district will remain closed till February 28.A review will be done on Friday and according to the situation, the next strategy will be decided, Rao said.Private coachings and classes where physical interaction is done will also remain closed till February 28, he informed.“However, establishments like study centres where preparations for civil services examinations are conducted will operate with 50 per cent capacity,” the official said.Rao said there will be some restrictions on weddings and other social and political events.At a social gathering, a limit of 200 people was allowed, but over a period, as the situation became normal, violations were seen, he said.“Now, a decision has been taken to implement the cap of 200 people at weddings and social events in letter and spirit,” the official said.There is no restriction on inter-district movement, but the administration expects people to follow “COVID- appropriate behaviour” while travelling, he said.Rao said in all the hotspots, micro-containment zones will be created and a decision has also been taken to activate COVID-19 care centres at the tehsil level in rural areas.He noted that given the increase in positivity rate, the COVID-19 testing also needs to be increased.“Currently, the National Institute of Virology here has stopped the testing as they are occupied with genome sequencing. We are taking help of other facilities to increase the testing in the district,” he said. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-curbs-announced-in-pune-amid-rise-in-covid-19-cases-215643

21-02-2021||Mumbai||Health experts put onus on people for spike in cases in Maharashtra||As Maharashtra grapples with a spike in coronavirus cases, health experts and government officials are putting the onus for the surge on people not following face mask and social distancing norms.There is also talk of a fresh lockdown, days after the reopening of public transport, educational institutions and religious places, as fresh cases from rural areas of the state and non-slum areas in Mumbai continue to increase.The surge in COVID-19 cases continued in Maharashtra for the fifth consecutive day on Saturday, with 6281 new cases, the highest daily addition in 85 days, taking the state’s caseload to 2093913.Maharashtra’s death toll now stands at 51,753, with the case fatality rate at 2.47 per cent, well above the national figure of 1.42 per cent.Dr Sanjay Oak, who heads the coronavirus task force comprising senior specialist doctors constituted on April 13 last year, said the latest spike cannot be termed a “second wave” of the coronavirus pandemic.“People are not following Covid-appropriate behaviour. They need to restrain themselves,” he said.Maharashtra Government’s Principal Secretary (Health) Pradeep Vyas blamed people’s “indiscipline and negligence” for the spike.“There is laxity in following protocols. People are not adhering to Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said.“Authorities have to tell people that coronavirus is still around and the masses should not be lax and negligent,” Vyas said.Maharashtra reported 6,112 new cases on Friday, the highest daily addition in 84 days, taking the caseload to 20,87,632. The last time Maharashtra had reported over 6,112 cases was on November 27 last year (6,185 cases).In Mumbai, as the number of positive cases rose to 3.17 lakh, with the recent daily increase, BMC officials said the surge is being led by non-slum areas.“Almost 90 per cent of the new cases are coming from buildings. Most of them are either asymptomatic or mild and prefer to stay at home, said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani.The spike is due to increased testing and an intense surveillance process, he said.Between Monday and Friday, the state added 23,354 cases, much higher than the 15,149 cases that were added in the same duration the previous week.The doubling rate has dropped from 600-plus days to 393 days, another civic official said, attributing the rise to the reopening of various services.“More international travellers are landing in Mumbai; domestic travellers from Kerala are being tested apart from those from Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Goa. More services have opened up since February 1, leading to a rise in cases,” he said.Amravati, Yavatmal and Akola districts of Vidarbha are seeing a sudden spurt, reporting over 1,400 new cases per day.Kakani said the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had no plans for a lockdown in Mumbai for now and would instead focus on increased testing and treatment, and strict implementation of face masks in public places.Mumbai recorded 897 new cases on Saturday. The BMC has sealed 1,305 buildings or floors across Mumbai to contain 71,838 households. At least 2,749 cases have been found across these houses and can affect 2.75 lakh population in the vicinity, an official said.BMC has instructed all jumbo Covid centres in the city to inspect ventilators, para-monitors, housekeeping, medicines, supplies, oxygen, fire equipment and security so that when patients increase they are ready to admit them at once, the official said.There are 11,968 isolation beds in Mumbai, and of them, around 9,000 are vacant across government and private hospitals.Dr Subhash Salunkhe, who chairs the Communicable Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee, said he noticed a sudden surge in Amravati and Akola in the last few days, adding inter-district travel could lead to a spike all over the state.The BMC on Friday penalised 13,592 people for not wearing masks in public places and collected Rs 27.18 lakh as a fine.Officials have been directed to increase scrutiny and ensure people comply with the face mask rule.In trains and local stations, a special squad of 300 officials has been formed to check for compliance by commuters.The BMC has so far penalised 15.71 lakh people in Mumbai and collected Rs 31.7 crore as a fine.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/health-experts-put-onus-on-people-for-spike-in-cases-in-maharashtra-215631
21-02-2021||New Delhi||Navy team measures depth of glacial lake in Uttarakhand’s Tapovan||In a joint operation, an Indian Air Force Advanced Light Helicopter (ALH) winched Navy’s divers to measure the depth of a glacial lake formed upstream of Tapovan in Uttarakhand following the devastating flash flood, the Navy said on Sunday.At least 65 people were killed and 139 are missing after a glacial disaster in the state’s Chamoli district on February 7. The artificial lake was formed over Rishiganga after the calamity.The operation by the naval divers took place at a height of 14,000 feet above the mean sea level on Saturday.“The Naval divers undertook the challenging task of winching down from the helo and recording of depth using a handheld echo sounder (depth measuring equipment) in the near freezing waters. Throughout the evolution, the IAF pilots maintained accurate positioning in the difficult terrain,” the Navy said.The data will help scientists determine the pressure on the mud wall of the dam.The temporary water body was formed after sediments that the catastrophic flash flood earlier this month brought down, blocking the mouth of a stream that joins the Rishiganga river.According to the Central Water Commission, the lake is 400 metres in length, 25 metres wide and 60 metres deep.The water catchment not being natural the administration urgently needed to assess the condition of the catchment by measuring the depth of water.“With no road access and time criticality Indian Navy diving team were quickly mobilised onboard the IAF ALH,” the Navy said.

This is not aimed at giving rise to casteism,” the Republican Party of India (A) chief said.He further said his party would carry out an all-India agitation at the headquarters of various states and districts on February 25 to demand five acres of land for those who do not have any source of income, to enable them to earn their livelihood.

21-02-2021||New Delhi||States’ GST revenue shortfall may be lower by up to Rs 40,000 cr this fiscal||The GST revenue shortfall faced by states is likely to reduce by about Rs 40,000 crore in the current fiscal on improved collections over the past four months, an official said.The sharp decline in GST collections was estimated to lead to Rs 1.80 lakh crore shortfall in GST revenues of states. This includes Rs 1.10 lakh crore revenue loss on account of GST implementation and Rs 70,000 crore on account of COVID-19 pandemic.The centre had set up a special window to borrow funds and pass on to the states for meeting the Rs 1.10 lakh crore GST revenue loss.The official said that improved goods and services tax (GST) collections could bring down the total shortfall amount to around Rs 1.40 lakh crore.“We have done some calculations which show that the shortfall could be lower by about Rs 30,000-40,000 crore in the current fiscal,” the official told PTI.The official further said that Rs 1.10 lakh crore would be borrowed through the special window as planned and higher mop-up would be utilised to compensate for the loss of revenue due to COVID-19.The centre has already borrowed and releases to the states Rs 1 lakh crore under the special window.The official further said that for next fiscal beginning April 1, the GST council will decide on the mechanism for compensating states in its upcoming meeting in March.“The revenue loss next fiscal would be much less compared to this fiscal. However, meeting the 14 per cent revenue growth would be difficult,” the official added.Under GST law, states were guaranteed to be compensated bi-monthly for any loss of revenue in the first five years of the GST implementation from July 1, 2017. The shortfall is calculated assuming a 14 per cent annual growth in GST collections by states over the base year of 2015-16.GST collections, which directly reflect the state of economic activity, had plummeted to a record low of Rs 32,172 crore in April 2020, after the government imposed a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus.Since then, collections started picking up; and the four straight months of October to January recorded over Rs 1 lakh crore mop-up. The revenues in January are at record high of Rs 1.20 lakh crore. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-gst-revenue-shortfall-may-be-lower-by-up-to-rs-40-000-cr-this-fiscal-215609

Eventually, we’ll start reminding people to review and accept these updates to keep using WhatsApp,” the company said.Recently, the Supreme Court said that people have grave apprehensions on loss of privacy, making it clear that it is the court’s duty to protect this right as it heard a plea against WhatsApp’s new privacy policy which has now been deferred till May 15.A bench, headed by the Chief Justice and comprising Justices A.S.

21-02-2021||New Delhi||Not close to herd immunity yet, threat of second wave still lingers: Experts||The sharp decline in coronavirus cases in India has been dramatic and perplexed many, as it is contrary to the early modelling, which had predicted millions of deaths due to Covid-19.September 2020 was the worst month during the pandemic, when daily caseload jumped past the 90,000-mark and hovered close to 1 lakh cases for many days, along with scores of deaths. Many believed that the pandemic will spiral out of control and unleash havoc in most urban centres, which are densely populated. By December last year, aided by the scaled-up testing infrastructure, the decline in Covid-19 cases emerged as a new phenomenon. Theories were floated that the pandemic is beginning to retreat in a country, which was predicted to be badly hit by the virus.For example, in Delhi, which was termed as the hotbed of coronavirus, especially following the spike in cases post-Diwali, the impact of the virus began to taper off, with the national capital recently recording zero deaths due to Covid after a gap of 10 months.Delhi was not isolated in experiencing a decline in cases, as a similar trend emerged almost all over the country. Beginning February, India was recording on an average of 10,000 cases daily. But something is very peculiar about this decline, which appears to be unsteady, as cases abruptly begin to emerge in many states.    Raman Gangakhedkar, former deputy director of ICMR and an epidemiologist, said: “So far, we are not close to herd immunity (which means 75 per cent of the population has been infected by the virus). Sero survey showed that merely 22 per cent people were infected. Therefore, a large part of the population is still vulnerable.”  He added that after all the restrictions are removed, and life rolls back to normal, people will be exposed to the infection and also be vulnerable to the virus.“People need to adopt Covid appropriate behaviour, as lockdown cannot be imposed forever. We need to adopt a decentralised approach to open schools and colleges,” said Gangakhedkar.This emerging trend of the pandemic is getting more convoluted, with the seven-day rolling average of daily Covid cases registering a rise for four consecutive days for the first time in nearly three months.Maharashtra, the worst-hit state by the virus in the country, contributed to a chunk of the Covid-19 cases in the last one week, hinting at the re-emergence of the pandemic in the state. The seven-day average was 11,430 last weekend which rose to 11,825 on February 18. In comparison to the September spike, the rise in cases is negligible. But most importantly, the period when Covid cases nosedived has been replaced by the gradual increase in cases.November 19 onwards, more than 40,000 cases were registered every day, then a month later these cases were halved. On Thursday, 13,179 fresh cases were reported, which was the highest in more than two weeks. This week, Maharashtra for the first time reported more than 5,000 cases after a gap of 75 days. Similarly, the cases are beginning to increase in Kerala, Punjab and other states too.“In Maharashtra and Kerala, I think the people are taking too much comfort and they may have dropped their guard. Though the gradual decline is encouraging (especially in densely populated hotspots, where maybe 50 per cent have got the infection), but it does not mean the pandemic has gone away,” said Rakesh Mishra, Director at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CSIR-CCMB), Hyderabad.Mishra added that there is a possibility that the correct situation is not being reflected. “Rapid antigen tests are not accurate, they miss up to 50 per cent, and if replaced by RT-PCR, which is more accurate, the accuracy gets increased by 20 per cent. The crowd in hospitals confirm that cases are less and there is a general decrease in positivity over the weeks. However, it does not look like that the pandemic will be over soon,” he added.   The query that emerges is whether there is a possibility of a second wave of Covid-19 emerging in the summer or the monsoon season.K. Srinath Reddy, President of the Public Health Foundation of India, a Delhi-based think-tank, said: “That will depend on three factors: How many susceptible persons are exposing themselves by not following Covid appropriate behaviour; how many persons are vaccinated by then and whether more infectious mutants of the virus, imported or homegrown, have gained opportunities to spread wide and wild.”  Reddy added that he hopes that the country will fare well in these to effectively contain the transmission, though the possibility of a fresh wave remains a threat. Scientists and doctors have unequivocally emphasised maintaining Covid appropriate behaviour and urged people not to drop their guard against the virus, as the pandemic is far from getting over. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-close-to-herd-immunity-yet-threat-of-second-wave-still-lingers-experts-215595

The partnerships would be allowed for four types of academic collaborations, which include credit recognition and transfer, joint degree programme, dual degree programme and twinning arrangement,” the draft said.“Under the twinning arrangement, while a student enrolled in an Indian institution may undertake their programme of study partly in the foreign higher education institution, the degree or diploma offered shall be awarded by the Indian higher education institution only. The joint degree will be a single certificate bearing the crests and logo of both collaborating institutions,” it added.As per the draft regulations, no franchise arrangement will be allowed under these collaborations.“A franchise arrangement, whether overtly or covertly, by whatever nomenclature used, between a foreign higher education institution and an Indian higher education institution shall not be allowed under these regulations,” it said.

21-02-2021||Saurabh Malik||Man’s take-home salary must be basis of maintenance: HC||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, February 20In a significant judgment on grant of maintenance to estranged wife and minor children, the Punjab and Haryana High Court (HC) has ruled that a husband’s take-home salary is to be considered for the purpose. He can’t take the plea that a major chunk of his salary goes towards the payment of loan instalments and, as such, the balance amount is required to be taken into consideration for calculating the maintenance.The matter was brought to the HC’s notice after a husband, aggrieved by an order dated June 4, 2020, passed by the Rohtak Family Court, filed a revision petition. The Bench of Justice HS Madaan, during the course of hearing, was told that the husband had been directed to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs 7,000 to his estranged wife and a minor daughter residing separately.Court takes inflation into accountJustice Madaan said he found the revision petition without merit and bound to be dismissed. Elaborating, Justice Madaan asserted the revisionist-husband, said to be working as a peon in a government primary school in Rohtak district, was drawing Rs 23,400 as take-home salary. He had purportedly raised certain loans and was paying instalment. But the take-home salary was to be considered for granting maintenance to wife and minor daughter unable to maintain themselves.“The husband may raise a number of loans and then start saying that most of his salary goes towards re-payment of instalment of the said loans. Therefore, only his balance amount should be taken into consideration to return to his financial position. He cannot be permitted to take such type of pleas,” Justice Madaan asserted.Before parting with the case, Justice Madaan added Rs 7,000 awarded to both the petitioners collectively could not be said to be on higher side, taking into consideration the trend of rising prices and the fact that “things of even basic needs were getting very costly these days”. As such, there was no ground to interfere with the impugned order. “I do not find any illegality or infirmity with the impugned order. Rather the revision petition is without any merit and is dismissed accordingly,” Justice Madaan concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mans-take-home-salary-must-be-basis-of-maintenance-hc-215257

They have rallied around a cry for the repeal of three laws that aim to liberalise Indian agriculture and food sectors, not only at the cost of farmers, but also the food security of India’s poor”, the statement read.‘It’s mockery’Liberalising markets without taking into account farmers’ political voice and protecting against concentrated buyer power makes a mockery of what markets should stand for. —Sophia Murphy, Executive director, IATP“Liberalising markets without taking into account farmers’ political voice and protecting against concentrated buyer power makes a mockery of what markets should stand for; we denounce the three farm bills, the lack of consultation with farmers and their organisations, and stand in solidarity with the brave stance India’s farmers are taking,” Sophia Murphy, executive director, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP), said.“The draconian steps that the Indian state has taken in response to peaceful farm law protests and against those supporting the strike (such as detention of Disha Ravi) is making the fault lines of Indian democracy visible to the world. India is at a turning point: it can decide to honour the demands of its farmers or continue to stand by Indian billionaires who would benefit from these farm laws,” said Shiney Varghese, senior policy analyst at the IATP.A key demand of the protesting farmers is MSP for all crops to limit the market power of buyers in highly unequal markets. “The US has been a key opponent of India’s limited use of MSP at the WTO, arguing that it represents an unfair subsidy. Yet, the US Government spends tens of billions of dollars on its agriculture, much of it in programmes that directly contribute to low prices and commodity dumping in international markets,” the statement read. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/87-american-farmer-groups-back-protests-in-india-215258

Now, it is Mamata who needs help. She is begging for votes and has decided to step into the shoes of a daughter,” explained Anirban Bhattacharya, a journalist with a major Kolkata publication.The new slogan will also resonate with the TMC recent agenda of fanning sentiments against “outsiders” to corner the BJP which has emerged as the most potent force in the state to challenge Mamata electorally. Ironically, Prashant Kishor, professional election strategist hired by Mamata to help her win the elections slated to be held in the state soon, is said to have coined the slogan that reeks of provincialism. Kishor, a former associate of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, is a Bihari.Announcing the slogan at the TMC state office in Kolkata, Subrata Subrata Bakshi, general secretary, said, ‘Bengal wants her own daughter is the slogan’.

India is currently executing the Greater Male Connectivity Project, the largest civilian infrastructure project connecting Malé with three islands by a 7.7-km bridge-and-causeway link, which will boost economic activity and generate employment.Once implemented, the GMCP will render the Chinese projects insignificant in comparison and help demonstrate India’s overarching presence through a high-visibility project. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ties-with-maldives-poised-to-take-quantum-jump-says-eam-215264

The real plan was to defame India and create unrest here,” the police told Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana who reserved his verdict on her bail plea for Tuesday.Ravi was arrested by the Delhi Police from Bengaluru last weekend and brought to Delhi. She has been booked on sedition and other charges. On Friday, a city court sent her to three-day judicial custody on expiry of her five-day police remand.During protracted arguments on her bail plea, her counsel Siddharth Agarwal said, “If highlighting farmers’ protest globally is sedition, I’m better in jail.”As Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, representing the police, questioned her credentials for being in touch with anti-India forces “who are internationally known to have a design”, the court asked, “If I approach a dacoit for temple donation, how do you say that I’m privy to dacoity? What is the material against her?”The court repeatedly sought to know the evidence connecting Ravi with the violence. “Apart from the Khalistani link and that she was in touch....How do you connect the actual actors with these conspirators?” it asked.At one stage, the court asked the ASG, “Should I assume that for now there is no direct link?” The ASG said it was under investigation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/toolkit-case-delhi-court-reserves-order-215267

This step is highly irregular, as these are not regular government employees and, hence, are not answerable to anyone. In the event of any complaint against them, there will be no scope of any recourse,” the letter said."If there is a shortage of polling officers, the Election Commission may requisition polling officers from neighbouring states to ensure free and fair polls," the letter said.Assembly elections in West Bengal are likely to be held in April-May. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/contractual-employees-on-poll-duty-bjps-bengal-unit-moves-ec-215268

The positive response to the Budget reflected the mood of the nation, he said, adding that the government would honour the enthusiasm shown by private investors to capitalise on the Aatmanirbhar Bharat programme.The meeting discussed manufacturing, agriculture, infrastructure, accelerating HRD, improving service delivery at the grassroots and health and nutrition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/work-in-tandem-for-progress-pm-to-states-215272

The definition of unlawful content is expected to be widened under the new rules.Government sources said discussions were under way on how much time to allow for removal of content, with a 36-hour to 48-hour range under debate. Most countries follow the 36-hour timeline. The new rules would apply not just to social media platforms, but also to over-the-top (OTT) platforms and web-based news portals, the sources said.Focus on TimelineThe draft provisions speak of a self-regulatory system with a code of ethics, as practised by TV channels. A compliance officer to respond to concerns flagged by law enforcement agencies, timely submission of compliance reports by social and digital media players, a grievance redressal structure and powers to bureaucracy to act in emergencies within 48 hours should the platform in question refuse to comply.The sources said the social media platforms could be asked to reveal the origins of unlawful content – an issue that is expected to create a stir with WhatsApp consistently maintaining that it cannot compromise user privacy.Nations worldwide are grappling with social media giants’ power with Australian PM Scott Morrison piloting a law to make Facebook and Google pay news firms whose content they host on their platforms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stringent-social-media-rules-draft-almost-ready-215281

21-02-2021||Ajay Banerjee||10th round on way forward||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 20Even as China continues to blame India for triggering the Galwan clash, the militaries of the two sides today held the 10th round of Corps Commander-level talks to take forward the disengagement process in Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang in eastern Ladakh.Coming two days after the complete withdrawal of troops from Pangong Tso, the talks started at 10 am at the Moldo border point on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), said sources. The focus was to bring down tensions in the region that witnessed a tense standoff between the two sides for over nine months, the sources said. After agreeing for pullback, the Chinese ministries of defence and foreign affairs have tried to wrongly blame the Indian Army for initiating the Galwan valley clash on the night of June 15 last year. Available evidence, however, shows the clash was initiated by the People’s Liberation Army of China as the Indian troops were unarmed and had visited the site to verify an agreed-upon disengagement process. The Chinese had set up a camp at the bend of the Galwan valley along the LAC and refused to move back despite an agreement to do so on June 6.Senior functionaries on the Indian side see the latest Chinese statements as a face-saver for their local audience, which did not have access to independent media or global opinion.Yesterday, the Chinese Defence Ministry blamed India and put out a transcript on its website quoting Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, its spokesman. “The responsibility of the skirmish at the Galwan valley lies entirely with the Indian side,” it said. The Indian side had “repeatedly hyped the casualties, misled international public opinion, and slandered the Chinese border troops”, claimed the Chinese Colonel.The statements that have come within 10 days of commencement of the disengagement process show that China was under pressure to accept its casualties and, thus, honoured five soldiers for gallantry. This came eight months after India honoured its braves. The gallantry awards do not denote the casualties, which would be greater in number, sources explained to The Tribune.“We are always committed to resolving disputes through dialogue and maintaining peace and stability in border areas,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying claimed at a press interaction.From the Indian perspective, the June clash was a re-run of the one on October 20, 1962, when the Chinese announced they had “peaceful intentions” and asked the Indian troops to vacate Galwan post. On being resisted, the post, manned by the 5th battalion of the Jat Regiment, was attacked. A bloody battle had ensued, just like the one in June last year.‘History of the Conflict with China—1962’, released for restricted circulation by the Ministry of Defence in March 1993, says “the gallant fight is glorious chapter in Indian history.... the Indian troops fought a last-ditch battle (36 were killed). The Galwan valour imposed a caution on the Chinese.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/10th-round-on-way-forward-215285

Post corporate tax cut, the industry must come forward with its so-called animal spirits to position India as the world’s fastest growing economy,” she said, addressing the 65th foundation day of All Indian Management Association and the 15th national management day. The minister stressed each line of the Budget was carefully thought out with the PM reviewing the inputs given by the business community. The PM brought in his immense experience and direct contact with the industry to shape the Budget and now the industry must make the best out of it, she exhorted.Sitharaman defended the large-scale privatisation programme and easing of foreign investment norms by stating it reflected the mood of the nation since the logic of incremental change was no longer valid.Time to deliverPost corporate tax cut, the industry must come forward with its so-called animal spirits to position India as the world’s fastest growing economy.“We need transformational change to get over decades of slow growth and lethargy,” she said. In disinvestment, she said, “we have not behaved like other governments’’. The previous “disinvestment in trickles” was not very successful in spreading the ownership pattern.The minister underlined the government’s commitment to spend on infrastructure and promised that the high capital expenditure would not be a one-year story. “Therefore, you have to contribute to sustaining growth because the government has chosen to spend on infrastructure in a big way,” she reiterated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unleash-animal-spirits-to-propel-growth-nirmala-215291
21-02-2021||Chennai||Centre, states need to work together to lower fuel prices: FM Sitharaman||Amid an outcry over record high petrol and diesel prices, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said the Centre and state governments will have to together work out a mechanism to bring retail rates to reasonable levels.As much as 60 per cent of the retail price of petrol, which shot above Rs 100-mark in some places in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and is at an all-time high elsewhere in the country, is made up of central and state taxes.Taxes make up for about 56 per cent of the record high diesel rates.Sitharaman, who had increased central excise duty on petrol and diesel by a record margin last year to mop up gains arising from international oil prices plunging to two-decade low, remained non-committal on cutting taxes to give relief to consumers.Read also: Petrol at Rs 97 per litre in Mumbai, diesel crosses Rs 88-mark“This is a very vexatious issue. An issue in which no answer except reducing the price (of fuel) will convince anyone. I know I am treading on an area and whatever I may say, to bring in the reality into picture, will only sound like I am obfuscating.”“I am avoiding my answer. I am shifting the blame,” she said addressing a gathering at an event organised by the Chennai Citizens’ Forum here.She went on to explain the tax structure and how production cuts by oil cartel OPEC and its allies had led to a rally in the international oil prices, leading to a hike in retail rates in India.She, however, said the answer may lie in bringing petrol and diesel under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, which will end the cascading impact of taxes and bring uniformity.Currently, the central government levies a fixed rate of excise duty while states levy different rates of VAT. Under GST, the two would merge and bring uniformity, solving the problem of fuel rates being higher in states with higher VAT.“What I am saying is that this is a vexatious issue and no Minister can ever convince anybody because Indians being Indians and I am one of them, (will not be convinced),” she said.“It is a matter of fact that both Centre and States will have to talk.”Stating that the states levy ad valorem rates of sales tax or VAT which help them get more revenue whenever prices go up, she said it won’t serve any purpose if the Centre were to take the moral high ground and bring down excise duty to zero.“I can do that (cut taxes) if I have a certain guarantee that my revenue foregone will not be an opportunity for somebody else to get into this space and gain that,” she said.“If all of us are talking about consumer prices (on fuel to) come down (and the) tax raised by the Centre, tax raised by the states are not holier than one another.” The taxes by centre and states equal, she said.Fuel retailers, who were given pricing freedom over the years, daily decide on retail rates depending on benchmark international prices and foreign exchange rates.“Technically, the oil prices have been freed and the government has no control over it,” she said hoping international oil prices will come down.India is 85 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs and so retail rates are linked to international prices.“So long and short of it is (that) the states and the Centre have to sit together and see whether there is a way in which the retail price of fuel is at a reasonable level,” she said.Sitharaman said as a finance minister she cannot be one minister in the Union government to say how much the price can be decreased and whether that would not guarantee the States to earn more money.“Because every government needs more money, needs revenue and at the same time I can see a relief that not one additional paisa is being demanded from the taxpayers (from the budget),” she said.Asked whether bringing the fuel prices under Goods and Service Tax would lead to an answer, she said, “it can be”.“But to get it (fuel prices) under GST needs to be a thorough discussion in the GST Council (comprising Centre and the states),” she said.The finance minister said if the GST Council agrees on one rate then all over the country there can be one fuel price rather than Chennai being more expensive than New Delhi or New Delhi more expensive than Mumbai.“That anomaly can be addressed if it is under GST. And that can be just one tax which can be shared by both Centre and State,” she said.Petrol and diesel prices have been increased for 12 straight days, taking them to an all time high of Rs 97 per litre for petrol in Mumbai and over Rs 88 mark for diesel.Retail pump prices differ from state-to-state depending on the local taxes (VAT) and freight.

21-02-2021||Minneapolis||US farmer groups deliver solidarity statement to Indian farmers||Eighty-seven farmer organisations and allied agroecology, farm and food justice groups in the United States delivered a solidarity statement in support of Indian farmers' historic protests to Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a united front of over 40 Indian farmers unions.In the statement, US groups express respect for the unified struggles of the farmers and farm workers and urge both US and Indian governments to support independent family farmers and localised food systems to protect food sovereignty and the livelihoods of millions."India's farmers have mobilised to create one of the world's most vibrant protests in history against unjust farm laws that will increase agribusiness' stranglehold over their food system. They have rallied around a cry for the repeal of three laws — passed without farmers' knowledge or consultation — that aim to liberalise Indian agriculture and food sectors, not only at the cost of farmers, but also the food security of India's poor," the statement said.The signatories are concerned by several additional factors not included in this statement, such as the unconstitutional ways in which these laws were passed without following proper parliamentary rules and the Indian government's use of authoritarian tactics to deny farmers' right to dissent democratically.The solidarity statement was co-sponsored by members of US farm, food and racial justice organisations, including the National Family Farm Coalition, Rural Coalition, Northwest Atlantic Marine Alliance, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy and the Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, as well as diasporic Indians who continue to work with farmers groups in India."Liberalising markets without taking into account farmers' political voice and protecting against concentrated buyer power makes a mockery of what markets should stand for; we denounce the three farm bills, the lack of consultation with farmers and their organisations, and stand in solidarity with the brave stance India's farmers are taking," says Sophia Murphy, executive director of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP)."A majority of India's farmers are hurting, and the draconian steps that the Indian state has taken in response to peaceful farm law protests (demanding assured returns on farm produce) and against those supporting the strike (such as the detention of 21-year-old Disha Ravi, co-founder of Fridays For Future in India) is making the fault lines of Indian democracy visible to the world. India is at a turning point: it can decide to honour the demands of its farmers or continue to stand by Indian billionaires who would benefit from these farm laws," says Shiney Varghese, senior policy analyst at IATP.One key demand of the protesting farmers is for farmers to receive a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for all crops to limit the market power of buyers in highly unequal markets."The US-based signatories of the solidarity statement recognise the role the US government has played in creating the conditions that led to these repressive laws. The US has been a key opponent of India's limited use of MSP at the World Trade Organisation, arguing that it represents an unfair subsidy. Yet, the US government spends tens of billions of dollars on its agriculture, much of it in programs that directly contribute to low prices and commodity dumping in international markets", the statement said."Under the Biden administration, the US has a powerful opportunity to shift US trade policy to allow other countries to support fair markets for their farmers and shift its own agricultural policy to ensure parity and environmental and racial justice in the US,” it added."We are honoured to join the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Rural Coalition, Grassroots Global Justice, and 83 additional organisations standing in solidarity with the farmers and farm workers in India who have been protesting for 85 days to protect their minimum price guarantees. We have been forced to accept low farm prices and we support their demands for economic parity — fair prices and living wages — to defend their livelihoods, their food sovereignty and the future of their republic," Jim Goodman, board president of the National Family Farm Coalition."The Rural Coalition, which has fought for four decades for the civil and human rights for all producers and farm workers in this nation, sends our strong support and deep respect to the heroic family farmers and farm workers of India as you stand united together to protect the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and stop government policies that destroy the livelihood and future of family farmers, farm workers and rural peoples," says John Zippert, chair of Rural Coalition.

Narmada is the lifeline of Madhya Pradesh. Hoshangabad was so far named after an attacker Hoshang Shah, but will be known after the lifeline Maa Narmada, which is a matter of happiness. I thank the CM for making this announcement by respecting the public sentiments,” he said.State BJP president VD Sharma and several other leaders also thanked the chief minister for the decision.However, state Congress spokesman Bhupendra Gupta termed the announcement as the ruling BJP’s ploy to divert the attention of people from important issues like inflation and rising prices of fuel.“BJP only changed the names related to the Mughals, but not of those linked to the British rulers. Why the name of Minto Hall (old Vidhan Sabha building) has not been changed?This is just to divert the attention. Instead, it should focus on development and give relief to people,” he said.

BJP’s Rakesh Singh, the aide of Kailash Vijayvargiya, should be arrested. This is his conspiracy,” Goswami told reporters while being taken to lock-up from a city court.Singh, a BJP state committee member, alleged that the ruling Trinamool Congress and the Kolkata Police were conspiring against him and have “brainwashed” Goswami.He said that he has not been in touch with Goswami for more than a year and was ready to face any investigation.“If I am involved, they can call me or Kailash Vijayvargiya or Amit Shah. I think the police have brainwashed her.  I am not in touch with Pamela for more than one-and-a half-years now,” Singh told PTI.“This can be that the Kolkata Police is following the Trinamool Congress’s instructions. They are conspiring against me. These are baseless accusations, and I am ready to face any challenge,” he added.The Trinamool Congress said that the whole episode portrays the “true character” of the BJP. “Earlier, one of their leaders was arrested for involvement in child trafficking. Now another one is arrested in the drugs case.

21-02-2021||New Delhi||Disha Ravi’s bail plea: Court to pronounce order on Tuesday||There is no evidence to show that the toolkit on farmers’ protest is responsible for the violence on January 26, activist Disha Ravi’s counsel told a Delhi court which reserved for Tuesday its order on her bail plea.“If highlighting farmers’ protest globally is sedition, I’m better in jail,” Ravi said through her counsel on Saturday.Ravi’s counsel was submitting arguments after the Delhi Police opposed her bail plea, alleging she was preparing the toolkit with those advocating Khalistan and was part of a global conspiracy to defame India and create unrest in the country in the garb of farmers’ protest.“This was not just a toolkit. The real plan was to defame India and create unrest here,” the police said before Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana.It alleged that Ravi deleted WhatsApp chats, emails and other evidence and was aware of legal actions she could face.Why did Disha Ravi cover her track and delete evidence if she did not commit wrong, the police said, alleging that his shows her guilty mind and sinister design.Ravi “was part of the Indian chapter of the global conspiracy to defame India and create unrest in the garb of farmers’ protest”, it alleged, adding she was in touch and preparing and sharing toolkit with those advocating Khalistan.             “It shows there was a sinister design behind this toolkit,” the police told the court.However, Ravi’s lawyer rejected the allegations.“There is no evidence to link me with Sikhs For Justice, a banned organisation. And even if I (Ravi) meet someone, there is no symbol on him that he is a secessionist,” the defence counsel said.“The Delhi Police gave permission for the farmers’ march, which they’re claiming that I (Ravi) asked people to join, so how did I become seditious,” the lawyer said in court.There’s nobody arrested in connection with violence at Red Fort who says he was inspired for same because of the toolkit, Ravi’s counsel claimed, adding there is no evidence to show that the toolkit is responsible for violence during farmers’ march.The counsel also questioned the contents of the FIR and asserted that people can have a different point of view on a subject.“There is an allegation in the FIR that Yoga and Chai are being targeted. Is it an offence? We are now reducing the bar that somebody can’t have a point of view different,” Ravi’s lawyer said.“The talk about alleged genocide in Kashmir has been going on for years. How talking about it suddenly becomes sedition,” the lawyer said.A trial court had on Friday sent Ravi to judicial custody for three days after her five-day police custody expired.The Delhi High Court on Friday heard Ravi’s plea to restrain police from leaking to the media any probe material concerning the FIR lodged against her.The high court, in its order, asked media houses to ensure that no leaked investigation material is broadcast as it could affect the probe and directed Delhi Police to abide by its stand on affidavit that it has not leaked nor intends to leak any probe details to the press.Ravi was arrested by a Cyber Cell team of the Delhi Police from Bengaluru on Saturday and brought to Delhi. She was booked on sedition and other charges. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disha-ravis-bail-plea-court-to-pronounce-order-on-tuesday-215179

Similar action would take place on the south bank of the lake as well, he said.Sources said troops of both sides had retreated to positions that were agreed upon by both the sides.The disengagement process began on February 10.The Indian delegation at Saturday's talks is being led by Lt Gen PGK Menon, the Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps.

21-02-2021||New Delhi||Union minister helps Haryana shooter Manu Bhaker board flight after being stopped at IGI Airport||Olympic quota place winner pistol ace Manu Bhaker on Friday evening alleged that she was harassed by Air India officials at the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) while she was trying to board a flight from Delhi to Bhopal.The 19-year-old Haryana shooter, who was carrying two weapons and ammunition on her way to Bhopal Shooting Academy, was later allowed to board the flight.After being stopped at the Indira Gandhi Airport, 19-year-old Manu tweeted her 'problem', tagging sports minister Kiren Rijiju and civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri, besides others.Thank you every one and all who help me.Especially Who made my boarding possible. Few also think May be one sided and I got undue advantage. Sport ministry bears all my expense spent by me in any form Very clear if I had to pay for any wrong or right reason it’s Govt money.👇 pic.twitter.com/ztU7KH1BwX  Apparently after Rijiju's intervention she eventually board the AI 437 flight.Manu tweeted fives times on Friday, starting at 8.17 pm, and the last one was posted at 8.57 pm, after she was cleared to board the flight. She thanked the sports minister in her last tweet: "Thank you @KirenRijiju sir. Got boarded after strong support from all of you. Thank you India. [Flag of India] [Folded hands] jai hind." Rijiju responed by tweeting: "You are India's pride." Soon after that, Air India replied to Manu tweet by tweet."IGI Delhi .Going to Bhopal (MP Shooting Acadmy For my training i need to carry weapons and ammunition, Request @airindiain Officials to give little respect or at least don't Insult players every time &please don't ask money. I Have @DGCAIndia permit," was Manu's first of the tweets, and she tagged @HardeepSPuri and @VasundharaBJP Air India responed: "Ma'am we are really sorry that you have faced inconvenience while traveling with us. We request you to kindly share details of the issue alongwith your contact details over DM for us to assist you." In her second tweet, Manu sensationally hinted that officials asked her for "bribes"."Not allowing me to board flight AI 437 at IGI Delhi and asking now 10200rs Despite all valid Documentation and DGCA permit (sic). Top of that Manoj Gupta Air india incharge doesn't recognise DGCA," she wrote, and tagged @narendramodi @HardeepSPuri @AmitShah @VasundharaBJP "shall I pay this Bribes or!!!!" Air India replied: "Ma'am we have noted details, please allow us few mins to inform our Delhi Airport team." Manu's next tweet read: "Think this type behaviour is not acceptable (sic).Manoj Gupta is not even human. He is treating me like I am a criminal. Also his security incharge Such people need basic training of behaviour hopefully Aviation ministry will find out &will send him to right place."  Air India's response, apparently after checking with its officials at the IGI, was: "Dear Ms Bhaker Our Delhi Airport team has confirmed that the official at our counter had only sought for valid documents as per rules for carriage of your weapon on board. (1/3)." Its next tweeted read: "(2/3)In absence of the same, legitimate specified charges for the arms were conveyed to you. No one sought a 'bribe' as has been alleged.
