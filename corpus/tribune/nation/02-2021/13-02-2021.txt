Demonetization had revealed that amply."In the Lok Sabha on Saturday, Shah repeatedly assured the people of J&K of full support of the Central government.Also read: J-K to get status of a state at appropriate time, Amit Shah says in Lok SabhaWhen National Conference MP Hasnain Masoodi told Shah that the abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35-A was a betrayal of the Centre's agreement with the erstwhile state of J&K, Shah said, "Mr Masoodi, agreements are on papers. J&K is in our hearts."Repeatedly attacking three families – including Abdullahs and Muftis – for the lack of development affairs in J&K, Shah said, "These families were showing the toy of Articles 370 and 35-A to the people of Kashmir and did nothing in the name of development.”“We have executed a host of development workers in 17 months since Article 370 was scrapped. By 2022, as many as 25,000 JK youths will get government jobs, piped water will reach all households, all villages will have been electrified and road connectivity completed across the UT."Facing off with Congress' Manish Tewari, who said 60 per cent of Jammu's industry had closed during the last two years, Shah said, "Please do not put the accounts of 18 years in two years."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agreement-was-on-paper-jk-is-in-our-hearts-amit-shah-to-nc-mp-hasnain-masoodi-211975

The injured person has been flown in with the help of an ONGC helicopter,” the ICG said.Initially, ‘MV Albatross-5’ ship operating in the vicinity of the oilfield in the sea pulled the affected vessel away from the Mumbai High rigs, followed by the ICG deploying offshore patrol vessel ‘Samarth’ to douse the fire.A Dornier aircraft was also deployed to assess the situation. Pollution control vessels are being deployed to control the damage to the sea from this fire, the ICG said.“Another offshore supply vessel ‘Priya 27’ is also helping the ICG in this fire fight. A team from ‘Samarth’ has boarded the fire hit vessel. The ‘Rohini’ crew could not enter the engine room where the fire started because of the excessive heat and smoke,” the statement said.Mumbai High is an offshore oilfield 176 kms off the west coast of Mumbai, in the Gulf of Cambay region. The oil operations are run by the ONGC. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/offshore-vessel-catches-fire-near-mumbai-high-oilfield-one-injured-3-stuck-211973

We have come here today for the farmers, who have fed all of us our whole life,” Bhattacharjee said, according to the statement by the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), the farmers union leading the protest here.“We are because of you all. In the benefit of farmers lies the benefit of the country and all of us,” she was quoted as telling the protesters, who are camping at Ghazipur since November with a demand that the Centre repeal the three new farm laws and make a new one to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for crops.She recalled that the first fight for independence from the British rule in 1857 had also started from Meerut in western Uttar Pradesh.Bhattacharjee said she has come to the protest site to pray for the farmers, according to the statement issued by BKU’s media in-charge Dharmendra Malik.“I want that whatever happens, farmers should be benefitted by it. Nobody is unaware of the hard work that the farmers do and it is not to be said again that in the benefit of farmers lies the benefit of our country, and all of us,” she said.                           Thousands of farmers are camping at Delhi’s border points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur since November in protest against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September.They claim that the new laws and lack of a law on MSP would hurt their livelihoods while the government has maintained that the legislations are pro-farmer.  The impasse continues even after 11 rounds of formal talks between the government and farmers.

He will be taken for a CT scan and other tests, after which doctors will decide whether to shift him to the Government Medical College and Hospital for treatment," jail superintendent Anup Kumre said.Earlier this week, gangster Arun Gawli and four other inmates of Nagpur jail had tested positive for the infection.Saibaba is wheelchair-bound with 90 per cent physical disabilities.In 2017, a court in Maharashtra's Gadchiroli convicted him and four others for Maoist links and indulging in activities amounting to waging war against the country.Vasantha Kumari, Saibaba's wife, said she has written to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, requesting that he be released on parole and shifted to a private hospital for better treatment.The Government Medical College Hospital, Nagpur was not equipped to treat such patients and does not have facilities for those who are wheelchair-bound, she claimed.Saibaba suffers from several co-morbidities including heart and kidney issues that can lead to further complications, she said in a release. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jailed-ex-du-professor-g-n-saibaba-contracts-coronavirus-211963
13-02-2021||London||Oxford University Student Union gets first Indian female president||Rashmi Samant has made history after she became the first Indian woman to be elected president of the Oxford University Student Union (SU), on a manifesto promising syllabus decolonisation and decarbonising the world-famous institution.Samant, a graduate student reading for an MSc in energy systems, with a focus on sustainability, at Linacre College at the university, scored a landslide win in the election earlier this week when she received 1,966 of the 3,708 votes cast for the post amid a large turnout.The Manipal Institute of Technology, Karnataka, student’s Indian roots were referenced in her manifesto as she highlighted the need for greater “decolonisation and inclusivity” on campus in the Oxford SU leadership election on Thursday.“Together, we can reform long-standing shortcomings at the university, provide students with the resources and support they need to thrive in Oxford and become leading changemakers in our society,” noted her manifesto.“Being a BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic] woman from a former British colony, Rashmi is empathetic towards the struggles faced by marginalised groups,” reads her vision statement. Among her plans, Samant has promised to lobby the University and Conference of Colleges to remove all statues proven to be imperialist and conduct a comprehensive consultation on the decolonisation of syllabi to ensure Oxford course texts “celebrate and educate” Oxford students about the achievements of diverse scholarly voices. With reference to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on students, she has pledged to lobby for safety net and mitigating circumstances for her fellow students.And, related to her own field of study, her manifesto pledge notes: “Lobby the Conference of Colleges to divest entire financial portfolio from fossil fuels as soon as possible… [and] push all colleges to sign on to a university-wide sustainability strategy.”             The president-elect for the 2021-22 term is also joined by other Indians on her team, including Devika as Vice-President Graduates-Elect, and Dhitee Goel as Student Trustees-elect.

13-02-2021||New Delhi||Central Water Commission examining possibility of controlled blast to drain out water from new glacial lake near Rishiganga||The Central Water Commission (CWC) is conducting simulation studies on the artificial lake formed in the upper stretches of the Rishiganga river after the catastrophic Uttarakhand flood early this week, and also examining the possibility of carrying out a controlled blast to drain out the water.CWC chairman Saumitra Haldar on Saturday said studies are being conducted keeping in the mind the forecast of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) that the area could receive rainfall of 1 cm and snowfall of 10 cm on February 15 and 16.The CWC is also examining possibilities of what could be done if the water rises to a “critical” level.“We are assessing what could be the impact if the water level rises following rains and snowfall as predicted by the IMD. We are also studying what volume of water would be released if the lake bursts and how much time it would take to reach downstream,” Halder told PTI.He said the lake is 400 metres in length, 25 metres wide and 60 metres deep.“We don’t want the size of the lake to increase any further. We are examining all possibilities that also include controlled blast at the lake,” Halder said.He, however, pointed out that the site is not accessible and it has not been decided which agency will execute the controlled blast.“So in case if the controlled blast is not possible, we are also exploring other ways to tackle the situation,” he added.Halder said several agencies/ institutes like the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO), ISRO’s Indian Institute of Remote Sensing and Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority have conducted studies on the lake.The temporary water body was formed after sediments that the Sunday’s flash floods brought down, blocking the mouth of a stream that joins the Rishiganga river.The CWC chairman said as of now there is no increase in the water level from Joshimath to Haridwar. “We are continuously monitoring the water levels downstream,” he said.In a tweet on Friday, the CWC said, “An artificial Lake has formed on river Rishiganga in Chamoli district, Uttarakhand, with a length of 350 m height of 60 m with slope of 10 deg”.      The Himalayas has more than 2,000 glacial lakes of 10 hectares or more. The CWC monitors 477 glacial lakes of a size more than 50 hectares. These lakes also feed the Himalayan rivers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/central-water-commission-examining-possibility-of-controlled-blast-to-drain-out-water-from-new-glacial-lake-near-rishiganga-211958
13-02-2021||Buxar (Bihar)||Portion of Prashant Kishor’s house in Bihar demolished||A portion of political strategist Prashant Kishor’s paternal residence here was on Saturday pulled down by the authorities who said the razed part of the property fell on land acquired for the widening of a national highway.The house was built by Shrikant Pandey, late father of the former key aide of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar with whom Kishor had burnt his bridges last year leading to his expulsion from the JD(U) in which he held the post of national vice-president.K K Upadhyay, the sub divisional magistrate who supervised the demolition, said the razed gate and part of the boundary wall was on the land which has been acquired for widening of NH-84.He said the administration was removing all property situated on the land acquired. In some instances the owners themselves are doing the needful, but Kishors house has been empty for quite some time so we had to bring in our machines.He said the district administration has already announced compensation to all those whose land has been acquired and it will be handed over to the respective owners in due course.The SDM disclosed that a temple of Lord Brahma in the vicinity has also been shifted for the road widening project and was met with some resentment from the locals.Some people had raised an objection that the temple was being moved but property belonging to private persons was not being touched because they happened to be influential and well-connected. Hopefully, they are satisfied with the impartiality of the administrative action, he told PTI over phone.

A due recognition will be given to Khathing, who was so far neglected," Rijiju told PTI.Khathing's son John, a retired IRS officer, and other family members will also be present at the function.Khathing, who was a Naga from Manipur, was given order by Daulatram to march towards Tawang with 200 soldiers of Assam Rifles and 600 porters on January 17, 1951.Before World War II, Tawang was under the administrative control of the then independent Tibetan government.Despite several attempts, the British could not annex it.According to historical accounts of the NEFA, when Khathing and his men arrived in Tawang, he called a meeting on a high-ground near the Tawang Monastery for meeting local tax officials, village elders and prominent people of Tawang.He used diplomatic skills to win over the locals. He soon realised that the local Monpa community was struggling under the harsh taxes imposed by the Tibetan administration. He told the local people about India, its democracy and assured them that India will never impose unjustified tax on them.Soon, with the Assam Rifles men, Khathing took control of Tawang, tricolour was hoisted in Tawang and Bumla and the area became part of India.

13-02-2021||New Delhi||AIMPLB moves SC opposing plea seeking ‘uniform grounds of divorce’ for all citizens||The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has moved the Supreme Court against a plea seeking “uniform grounds of divorce” for all citizens of the country, keeping with the spirit of the Constitution and international conventions.The AIMPLB has opposed the plea filed by advocate and BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay seeking uniform grounds of divorce on the basis that personal laws cannot be tested on the anvil of Articles 14, 15, 21 and 44 of the Constitution.“The applicant would like to submit that the expression and ‘Custom and Usage’ in Article 13 of the Constitution does not include faith of a religious denomination embedded in personal laws,” the plea said while seeking impleadment in the petition filed by Upadhyay. .“The Constituent Assembly was aware of the distinction between ‘personal law’ and the ‘custom and usage’ and chose advisedly to exclude personal law and include custom and usage in Article 13 of the Constitution,” it said.The Board in its plea submitted that the laws related to marriage and divorce among the Hindus were not uniform and thus the customs and practices have been protected by the statute itself.The top court on December 16 last year had issued notice to the Centre on the plea filed by Upadhyay.His plea sought directions to the Centre to take steps to remove anomalies in divorce laws and make them uniform for all citizens, without any prejudice on the basis of religion, race, cast, sex or place of birth.        “The court may declare that the discriminatory grounds of divorce are violative of Articles 14, 15, 21 and frame guidelines for ‘Uniform Grounds of Divorce’ for all citizens,” it said.While Article 13 of the Constitution deals with laws that are inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights, Article 14 guarantees equality before law to all citizens. Article 21 pertains to the protection of life and personal liberty whereas Article 44 talks about a uniform civil code for the citizens.“Alternatively, this court may direct the Law Commission to examine the laws of divorce and suggest ‘Uniform Grounds of Divorce’ for all citizens in the spirit of Articles 14, 15, 21, 44 within three months, while considering international laws and international conventions,” the plea said.Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains have to seek divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Muslims, Christians and Parsis have their own personal laws. A couple belonging to different religions has to seek divorce under the Special Marriage Act, 1956,” it said.If either partner is a foreign national then that person has to seek divorce under the Foreign Marriage Act, 1969.  Hence, the grounds of divorce are neither gender neutral nor religion neutral, the plea said.   The PIL said the “injury” caused to the public due to this is large because divorce is among the most traumatic misfortunes for both men and women, but even after 73 years of independence, divorce procedures are very complex in the country. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aimplb-moves-sc-opposing-plea%C2%A0seeking-uniform-grounds-of-divorce-for-all-citizens-211943
13-02-2021||Washington||India accounts for 10 per cent of global road crash victims: World Bank||India, which has one per cent of the world’s vehicles, accounts for 10 per cent of all road crash victims, the latest World Bank report on road safety said on Saturday.Hartwig Schafer, World Bank’s Vice President for South Asia, said the Indian government in recent years has taken significant steps to address the issues related to road safety.“For India, it’s one per cent of the world’s vehicles and 10 per cent of the crash victims. This is something where, in particular in India, we have to pay attention,” Schafer told PTI in an interview on the occasion of the release of the report on road safety in New Delhi on Saturday.While the attention in the last year has shifted due to COVID-19, there is an interesting link between road safety and pandemic right now, he noted.“Unfortunately, the road crashes have not been going down and any time 10 per cent of the capacity in hospitals is being used for the treatment of crash victims,” he said.Schafer said road crashes actually hit the poorest and the most vulnerable segments of the populations.“The financial impact of the crash is much more on poorer households than on better-off households. It is much higher on women who have to take care of the burden of caregiving. It is much higher on those who rely on foot and also in the informal sector,” he said.However, according to Schafer, the good thing is that India was doing quite a bit on road safety.Last year, India amended its Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Act, which is “bringing a lot of innovation” in terms of financing, protection and enforcement to the fore, he said.Responding to a question, Schafer said that Tamil Nadu is one of the states which has reduced the number of crash fatalities by 25 per cent.“For us in the bank, this is a major part of our engagement in the transport sector—rural transport, urban transport—the focus on new mobility post-COVID is something that we are doing,” he said.In South Asia, he said, the World Bank is helping in road safety standards and institutional aspects of it as well.Building a safe infrastructure is one of the key aspects of addressing this major challenge, he said.“We need to make sure that we have adequate roadside barriers. We need to make sure that traffic calming areas are being put in. The roads have to be safe. The vehicles have to be safe too,” he said.“If we don’t have an appropriate vehicle inspection system then you have unsafe vehicles on the road, and it’s clearly documented that unsafe vehicles are actually contributing to crashes,” he said.Emergency health care facilities in the vicinity of highways make a huge difference in addressing the challenge of road safety.“When we plan highways now, we need to make sure that crash victims are getting care within the first hour of the crash. That very often makes the difference between life and death,” he said.Highway corridors in India that have a very coordinated healthcare and emergency health care of access, in terms of hospitals, trauma centres for emergency treatment, make a huge difference in terms of whether a crash victim recovers or passes away, he added.Enforcement is another key aspect of road safety.In the countries having credible enforcement, the number of roads and traffic accidents is going down, he said, adding that data collection and generation related to it is also important.The Indian government is working on all these aspects, he said, exuding confidence that moving forward there will be a reduction in the crash fatalities in India.Minister for Road Transport & Highways Nitin Gadkari is “personally, very much committed to road safety,” Schafer said, adding that the prospects of reducing road crashes in India are very good.The goal of reducing the road crashes by half by 2030, is achievable, he asserted, noting that the foundation for this has been laid out in India.Responding to a question, Schafer said that the global auto manufacturers should equip their vehicles in India with the same safety standards that they do in the United States and Europe.“The UN Special Envoy for Road Safety is working with the vehicle manufacturers association, to not have doubled standards,” he said, adding that this has to be addressed from both sides.“I know that the Indian government is looking into raising those standards and setting standards, but it also has to come with a global pressure. It is important,” it said.“You look at things that are available in terms of, starting with antilock brakes to go to automatic computerized lane retention. Those are things that we should see as standard across the world because they make a huge difference,” Schafer said.Indian roads witness 415 deaths per day in accidents, the highest in the world, Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari said last month.According to the Road Accident Report for 2019, a total number of 449,002 accidents took place in India during the calendar year 2019, leading to 151,113 deaths and 451,361 injuries. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-accounts-for-10-per-cent-of-global-road-crash-victims-world-bank-211942

13-02-2021||Chandigarh||Detection of huge astronomical flare could help open door to origin of the Universe||Indian Astronomers have reported one of the strongest flares from a feeding super-massive black hole, also known as blazar.Analysis of the flare from this Blazar—one of the oldest astronomical objects—can help trace the mass of the black hole and the source of this emission, thereby providing a lead into the mysteries of the Universe, and will help trace events at different stages of its evolution.Blazars in the heart of distant galaxies receive a lot of attention from the astronomical community because of their complicated emission mechanism. They emit jets of charged particles travelling nearly at the speed of light, and are one of the most luminous and energetic objects in the Universe.A team of astronomers led by Dr Alok Chandra Gupta from Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nanital, detected an exceptionally high flare from a blazar called BL Lacertae on January 16, 2021.They had been following this Blazar since October 2020 as part of an international observational campaign with the help of the Sampurnanand Telescope and the 1.3-meter Devasthal Fast Optical Telescope located in Nainital.BL Lacertae is 10 million light years away from Earth and is among the 50 most prominent blazars, that can be observed with the help of a relatively small telescope. It was among the four blazars that was predicted to be experiencing flares by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT), an international consortium of astronomers. Data collected from the observed flare will help in calculating the black hole mass, size of emission region and mechanism of the emission from one of the oldest astronomical objects known, hence opening a door into the origin and evolution of the Universe, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology on Saturday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/detection-of-huge-astronomical-flare-could-help-open-door-to-origin-of-the-universe-211936
13-02-2021||---||Facebook’s Oversight Board takes up new case from India||New Delhi, February 13Facebook’s Oversight Board has taken up a new case related to a user’s post that was shared from a Punjabi-language online platform and contained insinuations against Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.While the post was initially taken down for violating Facebook’s community guidelines, the social media company later restored the content.The Oversight Board is an independent body set up by Facebook last year to look into hate speech and other undesirable content on the platform.Previously, the Oversight Board had undertaken five cases, including one from India wherein a user had called for violence against French President Emmanuel Macron over a cartoon of Prophet. In that particular case, the Board has overturned Facebook’s decision to remove the content.The latest case involves a post that was shared by a user in November last year. The post included a 17-minute video with captions making negative comments on RSS, BJP and Modi.The post was viewed less than 500 times and taken down after a single report for violating Facebook’s Community Standard on Dangerous Individuals and Organisations.After the user submitted an appeal to the Board, Facebook identified the removal of this post as an enforcement error and restored the content. The user alleged that the comment repeated the video’s substance and reflected its tone. The user questioned why the video still remained on the platform if there was an issue with the content.The user also complained about the social media giant restricting their ability to post, and suggested that accounts be restricted only when users engage in threatening, criminal or misleading activities. The Oversight Board will now review the matter. The body also invites the public to comment on the cases that have been taken up.Facebook has, in the past, faced criticism in many parts of the world over various issues, including its handling of content and data breaches. It set up the independent body for content moderation in a transparent manner.The Board’s decisions are binding on Facebook and Instagram (which is owned by Facebook). Each of the cases are assigned to a five-member panel, including at least one member from the region implicated in the content.The Board expects to decide on each case, and for Facebook to have acted on this decision, within 90 days.Once the Board reaches a decision on these cases, Facebook will be required to implement the decisions as well as publicly respond to any additional policy recommendations that it makes.In May last year, the Board announced the names of 20 members, including Sudhir Krishnaswamy, Vice Chancellor of the National Law School of India University.In the previous case pertaining to India, Facebook had referred a case wherein a user had called for violence against French President Emmanuel Macron over a cartoon of Prophet. The Board overturned the decision by the social network to remove the post.While the company considered that the post contained a veiled threat, a majority of the Board believed it should be restored...A majority of the Board found that restoring the content would comply with Facebook’s Community Standards, its values, and international human rights standards,” Oversight Board statement on the website said on Friday.This decision should only be implemented pending user notification and consent, it added.The Board also recommended that Facebook provide users with additional information regarding the scope and enforcement of restrictions on veiled threats. This, it said, would help users understand what content is allowed in this area. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/facebooks-oversight-board-takes-up-new-case-from-india-211934

13-02-2021||Kulpi||TMC will win Bengal Assembly polls with 250-plus seats: Abhishek Banerjee||Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee on Saturday asserted the TMC will secure 250 plus seats while the saffron party will find it difficult to cross the double digit mark.He was countering the BJP’s claim of coming to power in the state by winning over 200 seats in the polls to the 294-member Assembly due in April-May.Addressing a public meeting here in South 24 Parganas district, Banerjee who is the youth wing president of the party and nephew of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee iterated that the saffron party’s clamour for a double-engine government in West Bengal (same party rule in the Centre as well as state) will fall flat before the single engine power of Mamata Banerjee.The TMC is going to form the government for the third consecutive term and the party will stay in power for 50 years, he said.“West Bengal will elect Mamata Banerjee as the chief minister for the third time,” the Diamond Harbour MP said.Referring to Dinesh Trivedi’s resignation from Rajya Sabha as a TMC member on Friday, Banerjee said “Trivedi was saying he was feeling suffocated. Let him go and get admitted in BJP’s ICU”.Noting that the only poll plank of the BJP is ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and it has no development agenda, the TMC leader alleged that the saffron party does not know to give respect to women.“They say Jai Shri Ram and not Jai Siya Ram."This is because they don’t know to give respect to women”, he added.‘Jai Siya Ram’, translates from Hindi to ‘glory to Sita and Lord Ram’ while ‘Jai Shri Ram’ denotes ‘hail Lord Ram’.The TMC youth wing chief also alleged that women are tortured in BJP-ruled states like Gujarat and UP.“See the way the saffron party showed disrespect to Mamata Banerjee at the birth anniversary celebrations of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at Victoria Memorial in the city”, he said.He claimed that BJP leaders coming from north India are a “bunch of outsiders” who are not aware of the culture of Bengal, and spreading fake news to confuse people.“Let me say our chief minister Mamata Banerjee will stand there like Maa Durga to fight against the BJP which has weapons like CBI and ED”, he said.Banerjee claimed that the saffron party is trying to influence farmers of the state by promising to provide Rs 18,000 in their accounts, if elected to power, but “Bengal will never sell its spine to the BJP”.The BJP has been saying that the saffron party, if voted to power in the state, will ensure that each farmer of the state gets Rs 18,000 in arrears under the PM-KISAN scheme.The TMC MP from Diamond Harbour said, West Bengal is the only state where people are getting free ration and education.“Let me say the BJP should first think of Gujarat, UP and other states. No need to worry about Bengal. Outsiders will not rule Bengal,” Banerjee said.

13-02-2021||Jaipur||PM wants to 'hand over' entire agriculture business to his 'two friends', alleges Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to “hand over” the entire agriculture business to his “two friends”.Addressing farmers at Rupangarh in Rajasthan, he said 40 per cent people of the country are stakeholders in the farming business.“It is the business of 40 per cent people, which includes farmers, small and medium businessmen, traders and labourers. Narendra Modi wants to give this entire business to his two friends. This is the objective of the farm laws,” he claimed but did not name anyone.“Narendra Modi said he is giving options but the options are: hunger, unemployment and suicide,” he alleged.Gandhi, wearing a Rajasthani safa or turban, reached the rally venue driving a tractor with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and state Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasra sitting with him.The former Congress chief spoke while standing on a platform made of two tractor-trailers while the farmers sat or stood on tractor-trailers around the platform.Later in another rally at Nagaur’s Makrana, Gandhi said the backbone of the country is being broken, which started with demonetisation.“Future is being snatched from the youth. In front of your eyes, the backbone of the country is being broken. It began with demonetisation, after which the GST…Gabbar Singh Tax… was brought and small businesses were hit,” Gandhi said in the farmers’ rally. “Farmers, labourers, traders are being sidelined and the path is being cleared for two-three businessmen. During the coronavirus lockdown, labourers requested the prime minister to give them tickets to go home but he did not yield to it and waived loans of Rs 1.5 lakh crore of the rich,” he alleged.Gandhi said it was his responsibility to tell the truth and it is for the people to listen or not to listen. “In February last year, I had said 10-15 times that Bharat Mata is going to suffer drastic losses due to coronavirus. Farmers, labourers and the poor are going to be badly hit but ‘press wale’ (media) said he is not a farmer, he is anti-national,” he said.Gandhi said he kept silence in Parliament as a mark of respect to 200 farmers who died during the agitation against the farm laws but not a single BJP MP stood for it. “The Speaker said I should give in writing. Now, I will give in writing to the Speaker that all members in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha should observe a two-minute silence,” he said while expressing confidence that the Speaker will allow this.About the farm laws he said, “The first law is about finishing the mandi system, the second is about allowing unlimited hoarding and the third is about snatching the rights of farmers to go to courts.” AICC general secretary Ajay Maken, chief minister Ashok Gehlot, state Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra and former deputy CM Sachin Pilot also addressed farmers.

13-02-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC judge behind controversial ‘skin-to-skin’ verdict takes oath as its additional judge for 1 year||The Bombay High Court's judge Justice Pushpa Ganediwala, who had delivered two controversial verdicts in sexual assault cases, on Saturday took oath as the high court's additional judge for one more year.Justice Ganediwala's earlier tenure as an additional judge of the Bombay High Court ended on Friday.Justice Nitin Jamdar, the senior most judge at the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court, administered the oath of office to her.The oath-taking ceremony was attended virtually by the Bombay High Court's Chief Justice Dipankar Datta.Last month, the Supreme Court collegium had withdrawn its approval to a proposal for the appointment of Justice Ganediwala as a permanent judge of the court following her two controversial verdicts.The collegium had recommended that she be given a fresh term as an additional judge for two years.However, the government issued a notification on Friday saying she has been given a fresh term as an additional judge for one year.Additional judges are usually appointed for two years before being elevated as permanent judges.The decision was taken after the judge faced flak for her interpretation of sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.Justice Ganediwala had recently acquitted a man accused of groping a 12-year-old girl's breast because he did not make any "skin-to-skin contact" with the minor and days earlier, ruled that holding the hands of a five-year-old girl and unzipping the trousers do not amount to "sexual assault" under the POCSO Act.On January 27, the Supreme Court stayed the Bombay High Court order acquitting the man after Attorney General K K Venugopal said the order would set a dangerous precedent.The collegium headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, at a meeting held on January 20, had okayed the proposal for making Justice Ganediwala a permanent judge.Besides the CJI, justices N V Ramana and R F Nariman are part of the three-member collegium, which takes decisions with regard to high court judges. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bombay-hc-judge-behind-controversial-skin-to-skin-verdict-takes-oath-as-its-additional-judge-for-1-year-211916

The road near the border has remained closed due to the farmers' protests since the last 80 days, due to which the local people are facing various problems.The farmers have been protesting at various borders of the national capital against the three new farm laws since November 26, 2020.The farmers have been sitting at the Ghazipur border and after the violence on Republic Day, barricades have been placed by the local administration to prevent the farmers from entering Delhi.The local residents have been forced to wait on the streets for several hours while commuting from Ghaziabad district in Uttar Pradesh to Delhi, so a group of local residents sat on a 'dharna' against the farmer agitation.They demanded that the protest should end soon as the people living near the border are getting tired of the continuous protests.Some of the locals said: "What protest is this by closing the roads? We are facing trouble in commuting to office every morning”.However, the people sitting on this protest ended it after some time after they handed a memorandum to the administration and asked them to put an end to the farmers' agitation at the earliest. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ghazipur-border-residents-hold-protest-against-farmers-agitation-211914

13-02-2021||New Delhi||Parliament approves Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill||A bill to merge the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) cadre of all-India services officers with the Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre was passed by Lok Sabha on Saturday by a voice vote.The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 has already been passed by Rajya Sabha.The statutory resolution, opposing the ordinance which the bill has replaced, was rejected by the House. An amendment, too, was defeated by a voice vote.Earlier in the day, introducing ‘The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2021’, Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy said the government was working to take Jammu and Kashmir on the path to development.He said around 170 central laws were being implemented in Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution — that gave a special status to the erstwhile state.The government was implementing different development projects and schemes in Jammu and Kashmir, he added.“I request the members to pass the bill,” he added.Raising objections on the bill, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury asked “what was the need to bring an ordinance for this?”He said regularly promulgating an ordinance was not good for a parliamentary democracy as an ordinance should be preceded by an emergency situation or any urgency.“Our point of contention is loud and clear,” he said, adding after abrogating Article 370, the government showed a “dream” to the people that they would “make heaven” in Jammu and Kashmir and create jobs there.Introduction of this bill reflected that the government took the step of abrogating Article 370 without any preparation, Chowdhury alleged.The Congress leader said Jammu and Kashmir was a sensitive state and the cadre should be local and officers having ground knowledge should be appointed there.He alleged that militancy was still prevalent in the Union Territory and people were living in an atmosphere of fear.The government tried to turn Jammu and Kashmir into a large prison, the opposition leader said, adding they blocked telecommunication services and failed to normalise the situation there.“There is unemployment, restriction, lost avenues and total confusion,” Chowdhury added.He further said the government had promised to bring back Kashmiri Pandits to the Kashmir valley but had failed to ensure their return.“Please think for Jammu and Kashmir with new ideas and do not take adhoc measures,” he said, adding the government should make Jammu and Kashmir a state and create a cadre to appoint officers there.Speaking against the bill, Hasnain Masoodi (J&K NC) said this bill was akin to an assault on the people of Jammu and Kashmir.“You are continuously increasing confusion...What is the objective of this bill? ...You are taking Jammu and Kashmir towards uncertainty through this bill,” he said, adding appointed officers should have connect with the ground realities.e added that the government should restore the position of Jammu and Kashmir to that prior to August 5, 2019.

13-02-2021||Vijay Mohan||Amid LAC deployments, parliamentary panel flags delays in border road construction||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, February 13Amidst the intense focus on troop movements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in eastern Ladakh, a key Parliamentary panel has taken the government to task over delays in the construction of border roads and strategic bridges.In a report tabled on February 12, the Standing Committee on Defence has revealed that to date, construction of 11 Indo-China border roads (ICBRs) — which were scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018-19 fiscal — only six roads have been made.The standing committee also said only seven out of 20 bridges — that were supposed to be constructed by 2017 — are operational till now.Also read: Parliamentary panel on defence intends to visit Galwan Valley, Pangong Lake in LadakhOf the said 11 roads, the six completed stretches include Nelong-Naga, Naga-Sonam, Tri Jn-Bheem Base-Dokala, Joshimath-Malari, Musapani-Ghastoli and Nacho-TCC. Works are continuing on Sumna-Rimkhim, Tato-Manigong-Tadagade, LGG-Mukto-Teli, Leh-Upsi-Sarchu and Tawaghat-Ghatibagarh roads, where the progress ranges between 64 per cent and 93 per cent.Commenting on the action taken by the government on the observations and recommendations contained in its earlier report on ‘Provision of all-weather road connectivity under Border Roads Organisation (BRO) and other agencies up to international borders as well as strategic areas’, the committee has stressed that the BRO should take the matter with utmost priority and seriousness, especially keeping in view the present tense scenario at India and China border, and to overcome the hurdles in the direction of shortening the project completion time.Development of border infrastructure has been a long-standing issue with recurring delays and cost overruns due to a host of issues affecting the construction activities. Border roads came into focus during the 10-month long stand-off between Indian and Chinese forces in Ladakh that began in April last year.It was only this week that the disengagement process started, with some elements being pulled back from the LAC by both sides.The Committee, in its earlier report of 2019, had recommended expeditious completion of the ICBR projects. There were 73 roads with a total length of 3,812 km, of which 61 ICBRs of 3,323.57 km was entrusted to the BRO.The committee also found that of these 61 ICBRs, as many as 33 ICBRs have been completed, and connectivity has been achieved in 3,204.11 km of road length.Based on the requirement of the Army, the revised planning for completion of the remaining 28 ICBRs was projected as 11 in 2019-20, nine in 2020-21, six in 2021-22 and two in 2022-23.Of the 20 bridges in strategically important border areas that were to be completed between 2010 and 2017, 11 are in Arunachal Pradesh, five in Uttarakhand and four in Jammu and Kashmir.Observing that the completed works include six in Arunachal and one in Uttarakhand, the Committee has sought the reasons for the delay in every bridge, along with the action taken by the Defence Ministry in the field of designing of the bridges and the basis on which the sites were chosen.Obtaining forest and wildlife clearances, difficult terrain conditions, hard rock stretches, limited working period, paucity of construction material, and challenges posed by natural disasters such as flash flood and earthquakes, are among the reasons cited by the Defence Ministry for construction delays.The Ministry has also stated that the design and execution of bridges involve complex processes, and factors considered during the planning stage get enhanced many times by adversity of terrain and nature.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-lac-deployments-parliamentary-panel-flags-delays-in-border-road-construction-211893

13-02-2021||United Nations||Indian-origin employee at UN announces her candidacy for its Secretary-General||An Indian-origin employee at the UN has announced her candidacy to be its next Secretary-General, the first person to throw her hat in the ring against incumbent Antonio Guterres, who is seeking a second five-year term beginning January 2022 as chief of the world organisation.Arora Akanksha, 34, working as an audit coordinator for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), said she will run for the post of the world's top diplomat and launched her campaign #AroraForSG this month.“People in my position aren't supposed to stand up to the ones in charge. We are supposed to wait our turn, hop on the hamster wheel, go to work, keep our heads down and accept that the world is the way it is,” Akanksha said in a two and half minute campaign video posted online.The video shows Akanksha walking inside the sprawling UN headquarters, as her voiceover says that people who have come before her have failed to hold the UN accountable.“For 75 years, the UN has not fulfilled its promise to the world - refugees haven't been protected, humanitarian aid has been minimal, and technology and innovation has been on the back-burner. We deserve a UN that leads progress," she said. “That is why I am running for the Secretary-General of the United Nations. I refuse to be a by-stander. I will not accept this is the best the UN can do,” she said in the video.Last month Guterres, 71 had confirmed that he will seek a second five-year term as chief of the world organisation.Guterres's first term ends on December 31 this year and the term of the next Secretary-General will begin on January 1, 2022.       Guterres assumed office on January 1, 2017 after a reformed selection process that included a public informal dialogue session in the General Assembly.Guterres is the 9th Secretary-General of the United Nations and no woman has held the position of the world's top diplomat in the 75-year history of the United Nations.The Secretary-General is appointed by the General Assembly, on the recommendation of the Security Council, making the Secretary-General's selection subject to the veto of any of the five permanent members of the Council.Stephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the Secretary-General, responding to a question at the daily briefing on the UNDP staffer announcing her candidacy for Secretary-General, said "Antonio Guterres is a candidate for the selection process. It's not for him to comment on other people who may want to come forward."This is a process run by Member States. So, I'm not aware of any issues or problems with that….I speak for the incumbent candidate, but we have no comment on anyone else who may wish to put their hat in the proverbial ring,” Dujarric said.The spokesperson for UN General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir, Brenden Varma was asked at the press briefing whether Akanksha had written to the President on her candidacy.Varma said the President's office had not received any formal communications on this matter.Varma had earlier said that so far the General Assembly President had not received any notifications of candidacies for the position of Secretary-General from Member States.He added that candidates have traditionally been presented by Member States.In the video, Akanksha adds that it is time that the UN stops serving politicians and start serving people. “It is time for a new UN - a UN that is a guardian for refugees, takes humanitarian crises through to completion and gets technology and education in the hands of all.” She said these ideas are not impossible and don't need another 75 years to accomplish. “It takes someone being bold, being a first - first to speak up, first to take action, first to make a difference and now first to challenge the UN. I'm no longer waiting for the torch to be passed down, I'm taking it because I am part of the generation of change where we don't just talk about change, we cause change,” she said.According to her profile on her website UNOW.org, Akanksha graduated from York University, Toronto with a Bachelor of Administrative Studies.She received her Master in Public Administration from Columbia University.Her profile states that she was recruited at the UN to “help with the financial reforms of the organisation” and her work included updating financial regulations and rules of the UN and managing the internal and external audits at UNDP.A report in news site PassBlue said India-born Akanksha has an Overseas Citizenship of India and a Canadian passport.She “hasn't asked either country for an official endorsement. She is nevertheless hopeful that her candidacy could shake up the selection process,” the PassBlue report said.

13-02-2021||New Delhi||Delhi cop hangs self in ambulance after 3 hospitals refuse admission||A 39-year-old Delhi Police sub-inspector ended his life while he was being taken to a hospital in an ambulance, officials said on Friday.The deceased has been identified as Rajbir Singh. He was posted in southeast district lines and was mentally unsound, they said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) RP Meena said, "An information was received that Singh has ended his life by hanging himself with a piece of cloth in a CATS ambulance which was taking him to a hospital for admission from his house."        He had been on leave for five days and was marked absent on Friday morning at District Line, he said.According to the police, Singh called the CATS ambulance from his residence and was taken to the DDU hospital but doctors refused to admit him there.Thereafter, another CATS ambulance took him to the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS) hospital but due to absence of an attendant, doctors refused to admit him here too, police said.Thereafter, the same ambulance took him to Guru Teg Bahadur hospital where doctors asked the ambulance in-charge to get a slip prepared for the medicolegal cases (MLC).   During that time, Singh became aggressive and started running around in the hospital premises. When he insisted on going to IHBAS again, the ambulance in-charge tried to pacify him, a senior police officer said.However, finally when they were heading towards IHBAS again, Singh ended his life inside the CATS ambulance by hanging himself with the help of the curtains and spring wire while the vehicle was still inside the premises of Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, the officer said.Police said an enquiry is being conducted and legal action will be taken accordingly.      Singh, a native of Mahendragarh district in Haryana, was residing in Dwarka with his family. He is survived by his wife and a daughter and his parents reside at his native village.

13-02-2021||New Delhi||Govt pursuing reforms to make India self-reliant: Sitharaman in Lok Sabha||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said that the government, undeterred by the COVID-19 pandemic, has been pursuing reforms for achieving sustained long-term growth in a bid to make India one of the top economies of the world in the coming decades.Replying to debate on Budget 2021-22 in Lok Sabha, she said, the Prime Minister did not lose any opportunity to continue with the reforms and this Budget has set the pace for India to become self-reliant or 'aatmanirbhar'.Also read: Rahul Gandhi becoming ‘doomsday man’ for India says Nirmala SitharamanEarlier this month, the Finance Minister presented a Rs 34.5 lakh crore Budget for 2021-22, in the backdrop of the pandemic.The Budget has laid emphasis on increasing capital expenditure, raising allocation for health care capacity building and development of agriculture infrastructure, among others, which are expected to have a multiplier effect on the economy.She said her Budget for 2021-22, has provided the highest capex growth of 34.4 per cent by providing more money to railways, roads and defence.Referring to a series of measures taken to stimulate the economy hit by the pandemic, she said, COVID-19 did not deter the government from taking up reforms, which are going to be necessary for sustaining long-term goals for this country.Emphasising that sustained commitment to reform is blended in the Budget, she said, “reforms are going to lay a path for India to be one of the top economies of the world in the coming decades.”On handling of COVID-19 pandemic, the Finance Minister said, “The death rates are the lowest in the world, active cases have come down... we have actually managed to bend the curve. And as a result, the revival of the economy looks a lot more sustainable and this Budget gives necessary impetus.”Responding to the charge of crony capitalism, the minister said, the government under Narendra Modi works for common people and not for cronies.Reeling out statistics to show the government’s pro-poor policies, she said, measures of providing toilets, houses and MUDRA Yojana, rural roads were not meant for cronies.“We don’t do work for any cronies, we work for the common citizen who believes in the Prime Minister,” she said.She also took on Congress for accusing that the government is favouring certain industrialists and asked the opposition party to explain how a particular project in Kerala was awarded on invitation basis to one of the industrialists.Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd, India’s largest port developer and part of the Adani Group, in December 2015 formally began development of the international transhipment project in Vizhinjam in Kerala.With regards to increasing allocation for rural job guarantee scheme, the Finance Minister said the government will allocate more funds for Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MGNREGA) scheme for 2021-22, if needed, as against Budget estimate of Rs 73,000 crore.Compared to the previous regime, the Finance Minister said the government has always raised expenditure on MGNREGA scheme at the Revised Estimate level right since 2014-15.MNREGA under Congress was a “mess” with utilisation far less than budget provision, she said. The Modi government “removed ills out of the scheme and effectively utilised it.”          In the current 2020-21 fiscal that ends on March 31, Rs 61,500 crore was provided in the Budget but the provision was increased to Rs 1.1 lakh crore in view of the support needed to help those in distress during the pandemic.On the cash dole scheme of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana providing Rs 10,000 crore less in current and the next fiscal, she said this was because of “rationalisation” of expenditure following the West Bengal government not providing the list of 69 lakh beneficiaries.On criticism of cut in spending on defence for the fiscal beginning April 1, she said it has increased both on revenue and capital side and there is a decline only in provision for pensions as the previous year’s spending included payment of arrears for the one-rank-one-pension (OROP) scheme.On defence, she said revenue expenditure budgeted for 2021-22, is 1.3 per cent more than the previous year and capital spending is 18.8 per cent higher.She justified including water and sanitation under health to show more than doubling of expenditure on that head by pointing to a World Health Organization (WHO) report that sanitisation was part of healthcare.Actual allocation for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has gone up by 9.6 per cent for next year and that of Ayush Ministry by 40 per cent, she said.Hitting at the economic models adopted by the Congress regime in the past, the Finance Minister said India used to follow a model based on proximity with some country or other.“We (Congress) were socialist at one particular point of time, communist at another point of time, licence quota, crony capitalism another point of time, and finally even opening of Indian economy, it was us,” she quipped.However, she said, BJP since Jan Sangh days believed in Indian entrepreneurial skills, Indian managerial skills and Indian trade skills.Unless business creates wealth, the government has nothing to distribute to the poor and migrant labour, she said, adding, wealth creators, honest taxpayers are therefore respected in the country.

He died after a tree fell on him.Though the Army had declared the death a “battle casualty” as per applicable provisions, the office of the Principal Controller of Defence Accounts (Pensions) at Allahabad had rejected her papers saying the death fell in the category of rules which dealt with organised sports and recreation.Setting aside the rejection order of the accounts branch, the tribunal’s Bench comprising Justice Mohammad Tahir and Vice Admiral HCS Bisht held that the death fell in the category of the rules that dealt with deaths arising out of duty during natural calamities, which entitled a widow to Liberalised Family Pension.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/enhanced-pension-for-death-during-natural-calamities-says-aft-211523

The area comes under the Kailash range, and its ridgeline is considered as the alignment of the LAC. In October-November 1962, India and China had fought a pitched battle at the base of Rezang La.ALSO READ: PM has ceded land to China, says RahulNow as part of the disengagement agreement between India and China, the Indian Army and the PLA will vacate the positions occupied in the past nine months from the south and north bank of the Pangong Tso — a 135-km glacial lake.Back to ChushulThe target is to eventually return to the pre-April 2020 positions. In case of India, tanks were positioned in Chushul before April, sources confirmed to The Tribune. The spot is less than 20 km from the Rezang La heights and since it’s a plateau, redeployment would not be an issue in case of a misadventure by the PLA.During the pre-April deployment, Ladakh had some four regiments of tanks stationed across the terrain. Each regiment has 46 tanks.As reported in these columns yesterday, Depsang will be crucial and will be addressed in the next phase. On Friday, the Ministry of Defence issued a statement to counter instances of what it termed as “wrongly understood information”.“India has not ceded any territory as a result of this agreement,” said the ministry as it detailed the future of the disengagement process. “Outstanding problems (are) to be addressed, including those at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang. The outstanding issues are to be taken up within 48 hours of the completion of the Pangong Tso disengagement,” it said.The LAC, as per the Indian perception, is at Finger 8, not at Finger 4 (mountain spurs descending onto the north bank of the Pangong are identified as fingers). “India has persistently maintained the right to patrol up to Finger 8 and has included it in the current understanding with China,” it said.The Dhan Singh Thapa post at Finger 3 is India’s permanent base while the PLA permanent base is east of Finger 8.“The assertion that the Indian territory is up to Finger 4 is categorically false. The territory of India as depicted by its map includes more than 43,000 sq km which is under illegal occupation of China since 1962,” the Defence Ministry said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-disengagement-tanks-to-shift-20-km-from-pullback-site-211569

A false narrative is being created that this government works only for cronies,” she said, responding to a debate in the Rajya Sabha on the Union Budget.Policies for poorCentre’s policies are meant to help poor and farmers and not the ‘damaads’. The Budget provisions are for poor, Dalits and tribals. —Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance MinisterSitharaman then went on to list the Centre’s pro-poor initiatives that include 1.67 crore houses under PM Awas Yojana, over 2.67 crore households electrified under PM Saubhagya Yojana, 80 crore people given free foodgrain and the government placing orders worth over Rs 8 lakh crore with MSMEs.“Are they being given to big capitalists? They’re being given to MSMEs,” she stated, while counter-accusing the UPA government of having “happily encouraged” cronies when it was in power.Sitharaman then went personal by stating that the Centre’s policies were meant to help the poor and farmers and not the “damaads” in a reference to Robert Vadra, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law.The Budget’s aim was to provide a “strong stimulus” to the economy and gain from the multiplier effect. “We also looked at medium, long term and sustainable growth that will help us remain one of the fastest growing economies,” she added.The Budget provisions are for poor, Dalits and tribals. “Infrastructure creation, continuing reforms, transparency of accounts are the key features of the Budget,” she asserted.Later, she responded to skepticism about the Budget figures by again attacking Congress members. “Your track record is bad. Your Budget estimate was never met,” she said while reading out statistics from Budgets by the UPA government.She said the Budget draws on the experience, the administrative capacities and exposure that PM Modi had during his tenure as CM and PM.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oppositions-budget-for-cronies-narrative-wrong-nirmala-211570

The top court expressed hope that the parents will have “better sense” to accept the marriage and re-establish social interaction with their daughter and son-in-law.Autonomy integralEducated boys and girls are choosing life partners… this is way forward where caste and community tensions will reduce by such marriages. —Supreme Court Bench“Educated younger boys and girls are choosing their life partners which, in turn, is a departure from the earlier norms of society where caste and community played a major role. Possibly, this is the way forward where caste and community tensions will reduce by such marriages. But in the meantime, these youngsters face threats from the elders and the courts have been coming to the aid of these youngsters,” it noted.The top court said, “The consent of the family or the community or the clan is not necessary once the two adult individuals agree to enter into a wedlock and that their consent has to be piously given primacy… the choice of an individual is an inextricable part of dignity, for dignity cannot be thought of where there is erosion of choice.

Rahul said 64 per cent of the populace lived in the rural areas, and millions of farmers, labourers and small businessmen were connected to agriculture business. The Congress had been fighting to safeguard their rights, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi had conspired to let a few corporates monopolise the agriculture business, he alleged.“This will ruin roadside vendors also as the contentious laws promotes uncontrolled hoarding, black-marketing in agriculture produce and allied products. Come what may, the Congress will not allow this to happen,” he said.He slammed the central government for implementing “anti-people” policies, highlighting demonetization and GST. He said even laws enacted in the Covid-19 pandemic period were part of the BJP’s plan to benefit a few big business houses that enjoyed Rs 1.5 lakh crore relief in bank dues but migrants were denied even free and comfortable travel facility to reach their native places after the lockdown was announced in March last year.Rahul was accompanied by Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot and former Rajasthan Congress president Sachin Pilot.

PM Modi assured the Canadian PM that India would do its best to support Canada’s vaccination efforts, just as it had done for many other countries already”.On the other hand, the Canadian readout avoided mentioning that it was being forced to lean on India for vaccine supply despite a slight chill in ties after Trudeau had commented on the farmers’ protests.Ottawa said, “The two leaders had an exchange on their respective efforts to fight the pandemic, protect the health and safety of their people, and provide economic support for their citizens. PM Trudeau and PM Modi spoke about India’s significant efforts in promoting vaccine production and supply, which have provided vital support to countries around the world.“The two leaders agreed to work together on access to vaccines. The leaders also recognised the need for continued global coordination to respond to the pandemic and to promote recovery,” it added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trudeau-lauded-centres-approach-for-dialogue-with-farmers-mea-211474

Are they villages where the poor do not live? Whose lifeline are these roads,” she said, asserting that those throwing allegations unthinkingly must answer these questions.Sitharman said the NDA government has removed all ills from the rural-employment guarantee scheme MNREGA and spent highest ever about Rs 90,500 crore so far this fiscal.She said during the COVID pandemic year, the government has spent Rs 90,469 crore under the MNREGA rural employment scheme, which highest ever.Sitharaman said for 2020-21, the Budget estimate was Rs 61,500 crore for the scheme, which has been increased to Rs 1,11,500 in the revised estimates."Your track record is bad. Never your Budget estimate was met," the finance minister said as she reeled out data from 2009-10 and subsequent years under the Congress-led UPA regime.

13-02-2021||Aditi Tandon||'Feeling suffocated in TMC', MP Dinesh Trivedi resigns from Rajya Sabha, hails PM||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 12Ahead of the West Bengal elections, the ruling TMC on Friday suffered a huge jolt with senior MP and former railway minister Dinesh Trivedi announcing his resignation from the Rajya Sabha citing "suffocation in the Mamata Banerjee-led party".Trivedi took the Upper House by surprise as he announced his resignation when he got up to speak on the Union Budget.Trivedi said he was resigning “heeding the voice of his conscience”.“There comes a time in the life of every man when he heeds the voice of his conscience. We enter politics for the country. Two days ago, we saw the PM and Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad exchange emotional greetings. That was all about their love for the country,” Trivedi said.He said even when he was the railway minister during the UPA government he had heeded the voice of his conscience and announced a budget that offended Mamata but one that was in national interest.“When I was the railway minister I had a similar predicament as to who is bigger: myself, the party or the nation. Even today the world is watching us. The world was looking at the Indian response to Covid and the Prime Minister led this fight successfully,” Trivedi said hailing Narednra Modi's leadership.He said he was now unable to tolerate the way violence was occurring in Bengal.“I feel very restive sitting here in this House while Bengal is in the grip of violence. We hail from the land of Subhas Chandra Bose and Khudi Ram Bose and love for the motherland is supreme in our hearts. So rather than regretting sitting here I have decided to resign from my membership of the Rajya Sabha, go back and serve Bengal,” said the senior TMC leader.He said MPs entered politics to serve the motherland.“I can no longer condone what’s happening in the TMC where I am bound by party discipline. I feel helpless and suffocated. My conscience says it is best to resign,” said Trivedi signalling possibility of joining the BJP.BJP Bengal in-charge general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya was quick to welcome Trivedi’s move, saying Trivedi was welcome to join the BJP in case he wanted to do so.Vijayvargiya said many more TMC leaders were feeling claustrophobic in the Mamata-led “dynastic dispensation”.Party was unaware if Trivedi had issues, his resignation not a setback: TMCMeanwhile, TMC’s official spokesperson and former Rajya Sabha MP Vivek Gupta said Dinesh Trivedi did not discuss the issues plaguing him with Chief Minister Banerjee before his resignation.Gupta also said Trivedi’s resignation was not a setback for the TMC and will not affect the party’s poll campaign in the state.“We are all trying to speak to him but instead he is busy talking to others. This is the first time that we have heard that he is feeling suffocated or claustrophobic or he is affected by the violence,” Gupta said.“In his constituency which is Barrackpore from where he lost the last election, it is BJP’s Arjun Singh who won. So, if he is really affected by the violence then is his indication towards the violence perpetrated by the BJP?” Gupta said while addressing a press briefing.The leader further said from 2010-2019, violence, especially political violence was absent from the state.“By nature we Bengalis are peace loving. We believe in fighting with brains and not physically. We have no tradition of wrestling or contact sports. We are into arts culture and we have a creative spirit. We are shocked at Dinesh Trivedi’s statement.“He is one of the founder members of the party, a four-time RS member and (former) railway minister. Mamata Banerjee has given him respect... Last year, after he lost the election, he was nominated as Rajya Sabha member by the party. So I don’t think he has any reason to be upset with the party,” he said.Gupta also said maybe during the last year when people had to wear masks, Trivedi had found a “more suitable mask”.“His resignation is not a setback for the party, maybe personal loss for people like me who have worked closely with him or have learnt from him. Our campaign will go on as usual. Someone else will take his place,” he said.Gupta further said, “I do not think he has discussed his issues or resignation with (Mamata) didi. Before taking such a stand he should have discussed with the party leader. Maybe he was driven by some other agenda or he took an emotional decision”. — with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/feeling-suffocated-in-tmc-mp-dinesh-trivedi-resigns-from-rajya-sabha-hails-pm-211391
13-02-2021||---||SC notice to Centre, Twitter on PIL seeking mechanism to check hate speech||New Delhi, February 12The Supreme Court on Friday issued notices to the Centre and Twitter India on a PIL seeking a mechanism to regulate content spreading hatred through fake news and messages through bogus accounts.The showdown between Twitter and the Indian govt is another marker of how tough New Delhi can get. But as long as India keeps its Net space open, trying to block contrarian opinion and protest on these platforms is a bit like standing with an umbrella to avoid a tsunami. It’s a battle the govt cannot win, short of banning the site altogether. Twitter is an American company and threatening its employees has attracted criticism in Western media. more...A Bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde asked the Centre and Twitter Communication India Pvt Ltd to respond to the PIL filed by Vinit Goenka – BJP’s IT and Social Media Cell In-charge, who alleged there were hundreds of fake Twitter handles and bogus Facebook accounts in the name of eminent people and high dignitaries. The Ministry of Home Affairs had banned Sikhs for Justice under the Unlawful Activities and Prevention Act on July 10, 2019, yet it continued to have an active presence on Twitter and allegedly espoused hatred, terrorism and criminal acts, he submitted.Goenka sought directions to make a law as per which action can be initiated against Twitter and their representatives in India for wilfully abetting and promoting anti-India tweets.The Bench clubbed the petition with other similar petitions pending in the top court.The development comes at a time when the Centre has asked Twitter to block hundreds of handles for allegedly spreading fake news.On behalf of the petitioner, advocate Ashwini Dubey submitted that directions were needed to set up a mechanism to regulate hateful content on the social networks. Alleging that Twitter was being used to call upon separatist, creating panic in some sections of the society, challenging the unity, integrity and sovereignty of India”, Goenka said the microblogging site “knowingly promotes” messages which are against the law of the land.“Twitter and social media companies are profit making companies and expecting them to have safeguards for making social media safe and secure is important. The logic and algorithms that twitter uses should be shared and vetted by Indian government authorities or competent authority for screening anti India tweets”, the petitioner demanded.“These fake Twitter handles and Facebook accounts use real photos of constitutional authorities and eminent citizens. Therefore, the common man relies upon the messages published from these Twitter handles and Facebook accounts,” the petition read.The PIL said that fake news is the root cause of many riots, including the one in Delhi earlier this year, and bogus accounts are used to promote casteism and communalism which endangers fraternity and unity of the country.“It is submitted that at present the total number of Twitter handles in India is around 35 million and total number of Facebook accounts is 350 million and experts says that around 10 per cent Twitter handles (3.5 million) and 10 per cent Facebook accounts (35 million) are duplicate/bogus/fake,” the PIL stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-centre-twitter-on-pil-seeking-mechanism-to-check-hate-speech-211377
13-02-2021||---||SC gives six more weeks to Centre to decide Rajaona’s mercy plea||New Delhi, February 12The Supreme Court on Friday gave six more weeks to the Centre to take a decision on the mercy plea of Balwant Singh Rajoana for commuting the death penalty awarded to him in former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh’s assassination case.Convicted of assassinating Beant Singh in 1995, Rajoana has been in jail for 25 years awaiting his execution. The former Punjab Chief Minister and 16 others were killed in an explosion outside the Civil Secretariat in Chandigarh in 1995. He was sentenced to death in 2007 by a special court. His mercy petition has been hanging fire for more than eight years.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde – which had on January 25 given a last chance to the Centre to take a call on his mercy plea – granted additional time after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the President was seized of the matter.“The process has started and the President will take a decision. This is a case where the convict is accused of assassinating a former CM on the issue of ‘Khalistan’,” Mehta told the Bench, requesting it to wait for the President’s decision.As the Bench asked if he could give a time-frame for the decision, Mehta said he could only speak for the Government and not the President.On behalf of the petitioner, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi said the convict’s mercy petition had been pending for almost nine years and the case shouldn’t be adjourned for more than two weeks.Citing Devender Pal Singh Bhullar’s case, the petitioner has claimed that the “Delay caused by circumstances beyond the prisoners’ control mandates commutation of death sentence.” The inordinate delay caused agony and adversely affected his physical and mental health, Rajaona contended.Earlier, the top court had asked the government to decide Rajoana’s mercy petition before the Republic Day but had extended it at the request of Mehta who had said it would not be prudent to decide the matter at this juncture as it could have some repercussions in the present situation.The top court had on January 8 asked the Centre to decide by January 26 Rajoana’s mercy plea.Maintaining that Pendency of appeals by co-accused has no bearing on Presidential pardon granted to a death-row convict, the Supreme Court had on December 4 questioned the Centre over delay in sending proposal to the President for commuting Rajoana’s death penalty.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-gives-six-more-weeks-to-centre-to-decide-rajaonas-mercy-plea-211375
13-02-2021||Aditi Tandon||Gandhi loyalist Kharge to replace Azad as leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 12Less than two years after he suffered the first electoral setback in his political career, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, 78, is all set to take centrestage as leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha.The Congress has conveyed to Rajya Sabha Chairman's office its decision to replace Ghulam Nabi Azad, the outgoing LOP, who retires from the House on February 15.Kharge, a Dalit stalwart of the Congress, was leader of the party in the 16th Lok Sabha. He was known for vociferous opposition of the government and as a promoter of sloganeering and disruption - something he always said the BJP mastered in the 14th Lok Sabha under then leaders of opposition Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley.Kharge’s appointment to the key Rajya Sabha post comes at the cost of Congress deputy leader in the house Anand Sharma, who was long seen as Azad's natural inheritor.Sharma and Azad last year fell out of favour of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi after they wrote to her demanding overhaul of the party organsation and internal elections.Kharge is a nine-time Karnataka MLA and two-time Lok Sabha MP. He lost the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Gulbarga in Karnataka by over 95,000 votes to Congress turncoat Umesh Jadhav.  The Congress sent him to the Rajya Sabha from Karnataka in 2020.Back in the limelight, Kharge has his task cut out in the Rajya Sabha, which was recently lauded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for constructive debate on national issues, unlike the Lok Sabha.The PM, lauding Congress’s Rajya Sabha leadership (read Azad and Sharma) had said this week that the principal opposition was a divided house and followed varied strategies in the two Houses.The PM’s jibe was at the Rahul Gandhi-led Lok Sabha MPs of the Congress, who blocked discussions on the President’s address for a week demanding a standalone discussion on farmers’ issues. Ultimately, the Congress relented and discussed the President’s address but the party walked out when the PM was replying to the matter.A Gandhi loyalist, Kharge would be expected to ensure coordination in Congress’s parliamentary strategy and avoid embarrassing situations as last week’s where the party MPs of the Rajya Sabha were seen debating the issue and those in the Lok Sabha were seen disrupting the proceedings.Congress leaders privately said the closeness to Gandhis is Kharge’s major asset and the leadership was cut up with Azad for allowing the Rajya Sabha to function last week.“That was Azad sahib’s gift to the PM since Azad sahib was retiring,” said a Congress MP from the Lok Sabha, adding that the party’s Lower House members questioned Azad’s “unilateral move to participate in the President’s debate discussions when the Lok Sabha was insisting that the farmers’ issue be discussed first”. With Kharge's elevation, the fear of variant House strategies would no longer exist.Government leaders are, however, wary with some saying “disruption would now be the norm in the Rajya Sabha as it was in the Lok Sabha.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gandhi-loyalist-kharge-to-replace-azad-as-leader-of-opposition-in-rajya-sabha-211361
13-02-2021||Ghaziabad||Farm laws: Tikait to attend 7 ‘mahapanchayats’ in 3 states starting February 14||Beginning Sunday, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait would be attending seven farmers’ meetings planned across Haryana, Maharashtra and Rajasthan to garner support for the ongoing stir against the new farm laws.These farmers’ meetings, which will culminate on February 23, are part of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha’s outreach programme, BKU’s media in-charge Dharmendra Malik said.These “kisan mahapanchayat” are scheduled to be held in Haryana’s Karnal, Rohtak, Sirsa and Hisar districts, and Maharashtra’s Akola and Rajasthan’s Sikar, he said.Thousands of farmers are encamped at Delhi’s border points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur since November with a demand that the Centre repeal the three farm laws enacted in September and make a new law to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for crops.The government, which has held 11 rounds of talks with the protesting farmers’ unions, has, however, maintained that the laws are pro-farmer.Tikait, the national spokesperson of the BKU, has been leading the protestors at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border and said the farmers won’t end their movement until their demands are not met. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-laws-tikait-to-attend-7-mahapanchayats-in-3-states-starting-february-14-211339
