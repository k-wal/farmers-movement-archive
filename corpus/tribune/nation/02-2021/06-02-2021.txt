The ball is in the government's court. We clearly told them that their last proposal (of suspending the farm laws for 12-18 months) was not acceptable to us. Now, they should come up with a new proposal," he told reporters.Talking about the Saturday's 'chakka jam', the farmer leader claimed it got huge nationwide support which once again "proved" that farmers across the country are united against these farm laws.

Teen environmental activist Greta Thunberg was among the Twitter users who shared the toolkit but deleted the tweet and followed it up with another.Jaishankar said India has deployed troops in very large numbers to meet the challenge which has come from the massing of Chinese troops on the border.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/toolkit-probe-to-continue-jaishankar-208841
06-02-2021||New Delhi||Unwilling to wait, poorer countries seek their own vaccines||With coronavirus cases still climbing, Honduras got tired of waiting to get vaccines through a United Nations programme, so the small Central American country struck out on its own, securing the shots through a private deal.Honduras “cannot wait on bureaucratic processes or misguided decisions" to give citizens “the peace of mind” offered by the COVID-19 vaccine, said Juan Carlos Sikaffy, president of the Honduran Private Business Council, which helped complete the purchase by providing a bank guarantee.Other nations are getting impatient too. Unlike past disease outbreaks, where less wealthy countries have generally waited for vaccines to be delivered by the UN and other organisations, many are now taking matters into their own hands. Experts are increasingly concerned that these go-it-alone efforts could undermine a UN-backed programme to get COVID-19 shots to the neediest people worldwide.Countries including Serbia, Bangladesh and Mexico recently began vaccinating citizens through donations or commercial deals — an approach that could leave even fewer vaccines for the programme known as COVAX, since rich countries have already snapped up the majority of this year's supply.Led by the World Health Organization, a coalition for epidemic preparedness known as CEPI and a vaccine alliance called GAVI, COVAX was created to distribute COVID-19 vaccines fairly. Countries can join either to buy vaccines or to get donated shots.Mustaqeem De Gama, a diplomat at the South African mission in Geneva, cited “a level of desperation” fuelled by spreading virus variants and “the uncertainty of when any COVAX vaccines might arrive”.He doubted that countries that signed up for COVAX “will even get 10% of what they require”.     Even if the effort succeeds, COVAX's stated goal is to vaccinate less than 30 per cent of people in poor countries, meaning that governments must seek other sources to obtain enough shots to achieve herd immunity.Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said his country was forced to cut its own deals after watching rich countries scramble for the scarce shots. He criticised nations that, he said, bought more doses than they needed.“It's as if they intend to vaccinate all their cats and dogs,” he said.Although Serbia paid 4 million euros to COVAX last year, it has not yet received any shots and last month began its immunisation campaign with vaccines from Pfizer, China's Sinopharm and Russia.Recent manufacturing delays in Europe raise concerns about whether drug-makers will be able to fulfill the multiplying orders.“There are so many deals being signed that I think it's hard to see how the numbers could possibly add up for all the doses ordered to actually be produced in the foreseeable future,” said Amanda Glassman, a public health expert and executive vice-president of the Center for Global Development.Last week, the African Union completed a deal for 400 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, to be produced by the Serum Institute of India. That's on top of a previously negotiated African Union deal for 270 million doses from several pharmaceutical companies and in addition to the 600 million doses Africa expects to receive from COVAX.Some experts warn that these new deals could move COVAX further to the back of the line, especially if some countries are willing to pay a premium for speed.To ensure South Africans got doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine quickly, government officials reluctantly agreed to pay a higher price per shot than Europe or North America. The first shipments arrived this week.COVAX hopes to start sending its first vaccine batches to Africa later this month, but those plans are subject to change depending on manufacturers' production capacities and countries' immunisation plans.Mexico began vaccinating health workers in December because of a direct purchase agreement with Pfizer. In recent weeks, the country has been forced to turn to Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, which was expected to arrive next week, even though it has not been approved by Mexican regulators.Kate Elder, senior vaccines policy adviser at Doctors Without Borders, said developing countries should not be criticised for securing private vaccine deals since that is precisely what rich countries did last year.“Every country is just doing what it feels it needs to do to protect their people,” she said, but the ability of poor countries and regions to get vaccine faster than COVAX could hurt future UN efforts.“If countries are getting vaccines on their own, then how are WHO and GAVI delivering for them?” she asked.Although India is contracted to provide COVAX with several hundred million doses of vaccine, the shots have not yet been authorised by the WHO, meaning India cannot release them for the UN programme. In the meantime, India has already gifted neighbors, including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal, with more than 5 million doses.Dr Haritha Aluthge of Sri Lanka's Government Medical Officers' Association, called for the WHO to intervene amid the intense competition for vaccines and the failure of COVAX to deliver.“Not a single dose (from COVAX) has been received,” said Aluthge.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned recently that the world was on the brink of a “catastrophic moral failure” if COVID-19 vaccines are not distributed fairly, but the agency has no authority to force rich countries to share.

06-02-2021||New Delhi||‘Chakka jam’: Has the Centre managed to isolate Punjab farmers from counterparts in UP, Delhi and Uttarakhand||Amid a relatively uneventful ‘chakka jam’ on Saturday,  indications are that the BJP-led Centre not only “managed” the situation well but also managed to “isolate” Punjab farmers from their counterparts in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Uttarakhand who did not participate in on Saturday’s event against the three farm laws. While the decision regarding UP and Uttarakhand was taken at a meeting between Samyukta Kisan Morcha’s Balbir Singh Rajewal and Bhartiya Kisan Union Rakesh Tikait “in mind the ongoing agriculture activities and situations” sources are pointing to “other reasons” behind the surprise announcement on Friday. Almost four months have passed since the new sugar season commenced in October and the Uttar Pradesh government is yet to announce State-Advised Price (SAP) for sugarcane, making it difficult for farmers to get cane payment from sugar mills.Though the state government has not clarified the reason for the delay in announcement of SAP for sugarcane---the main crop of western UP---speculations are it is “waiting for the farmers’ agitation to be over”. While cane farmers are expecting a higher increase in the SAP, sugar mills are resisting any such move. The UP government has not revised the SAP of Rs 315 per quintal for three seasons. Apart from the underlying anger and uncertainty among sugarcane farmers, sources say “majority of BKU cadres are currently engaged in Delhi”, meaning that BKU leaders were also “skeptical about success of chakka jam” in UP.“The BKU (Tikait) has not objected to piling up of arrears of Rs 15,000 crore and delay in announcement of SAP. What could a three-hour ‘chakka jam’ achieved,” questioned a farmer leader, underlining the various political pulls at play over the issue The “shift” in attention and focus from Singhu and Tikri (where Punjab unions have been camping) towards UP and Ghazipur is a cause of much concern among those who initiated the agitation against the three laws.  In the developments following the January 26 Delhi violence, Rakesh Tikait has emerged as a “hero and main attraction” in ‘mahapanchayats’ not just in UP but also Haryana. Tomorrow he will participate in two ‘mahapanchayats’ in Charkhi Dadri, according to BKU. Meanwhile, sources say “clarity can be expected regarding the Centre’s next move on the three laws next week. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President’s Address in the Rajya Sabha”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chakka-jam-has-the-centre-managed-to-isolate-punjab-farmers-from-counterparts-in-up-delhi-and-uttarakhand-208838

with tractor-trolleys and squatted on key roads on Saturday, while scattered protests were held in other states during a three-hour ‘chakka jam’ called by agitating farmer unions which are demanding scrapping of the Centre’s new agri laws.Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait declared that their protest on Delhi’s outskirts will continue till October 2 and farmers will return home only after the government repeals the contentious legislations and makes a law ensuring legal guarantee for the minimum support price (MSP). No untoward incident was reported in any part of the country during Saturday’s protests though scores of people were detained in several states, including 50 at Shaheedi Park in the national capital which was brought under a thick security blanket in light of the violence during the farmers’ tractor parade on January 26.Protesters were also held briefly by police as they stalled traffic in parts of Maharashtra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.Read also: Farmers block

Congress and Left parties too joined the protests in some states in support of the ‘chakka jam’ called by the agitating farmer unions.While Delhi along with Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand was kept out of Saturday’s road blockade from 12 noon till 3 pm by agitating farmer unions, authorities suspended internet at the protest sites of Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri as well as adjoining areas for 24 hours till Saturday night and closed entry and exit facilities at 10 prominent Delhi Metro stations for few hours.Singhu border looked crowded than before as more tractors and farmers made their way to the protest sites, while drone cameras, multilayered barricades, nail-studded roads and barbed wires were in place as part of precautionary measures by the police.Security forces, including anti-riot police, were deployed at important junctions across the national capital, including Red Fort and ITO, which had witnessed violence on January 26.The police also monitored content on social media, officials said.Raising slogans against the Centre, farmers parked their tractor-trolleys or squatted in the middle of roads with posters, flags and banners in Punjab and Haryana, blocking several highways, including the Chandigarh-Zirakpur, Amritsar-Pathankot, Tarn Taran-Kapurthala, Ferozepur-Fazilka, Muktsar-Kotkapura, Bathinda-Chandigarh, Ludhiana-Jalandhar, Panchkula-Pinjore and Ambala–Chandigarh highway, leading to traffic snarls.Women also took part in the stir in a sizeable number at several places.Folk songs blared from speakers and people perched atop truck-tractors hoisted the tricolour on the KMP Expressway.In Rajasthan, farmers at many places including Ganganagar, Hanumangarh, Dholpur and Jhalawar stalled traffic on the highways and main roads and held demonstrations, police said.Farmers in Uttar Pradesh handed over a memorandum to respective district authorities, demanding the withdrawal of the laws.Several farmer groups and the Congress held a protest in Mumbai. ‘Rasta roko’ protests were held in Karad and Kolhapur cities in Maharashtra.At least 40 protesters, including senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan’s wife Satvasheela Chavan, were detained for holding a protest on a busy road at Kolhapur Naka in Karad in western Maharashtra this afternoon, a police official said.Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna leader Raju Shetti and others were detained briefly in Kolhapur.In Telangana, police said several people were taken into preventive custody as leaders of opposition parties joined the farmers in ‘raasta roko’ protests on various.Farmers blocked highways in different parts of Karnataka to show their solidarity, following a call given by various farmers’ associations led by Kuruburu Shanthakumar.  A few pro-Kannada organisations too came in support of the agitators.The demonstrations were held in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Kolar, Koppal, Bagalkote, Tumakuru Davangere, Hassan, Mangaluru, Haveri, Shivamogga and Chikkaballapura and protesters courted arrest in some parts of the state.Condemning the protests, Union Minister for Chemical and Fertilisers D V Sadananda Gowda said the Narendra Modi government has implemented the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee report to address the agrarian distress and farmers’ suicide.Protests were also held in Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu.The Congress had on Friday extended support to the countrywide ‘chakka jam’, saying party workers will stand shoulder to shoulder with farmers in their protest.Thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding the rollback of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.

06-02-2021||New Delhi||Centre urges states/UTs to exponentially increase pace of COVID-19 vaccination||The Centre on Saturday urged states and Union Territories to exponentially increase the pace of coronavirus vaccination and schedule the inoculation of all healthcare workers at least once before February 20.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan also asked the states/UTs to ensure that beneficiaries of the inaugural vaccination day on January 16 should start getting a second dose on February 13.In a statement, the Health Ministry said there remained a substantial scope for improvement in the number of average vaccinations per inoculation session."The state health secretaries were asked to analyse the daily variation in the number of average vaccinations and take necessary steps to increase them. States/UTs were advised to ensure 100 per cent saturation of people who have already been registered on CoWin digital platform.“They were also asked to organise simultaneous vaccination sessions/day in the health facility wherever possible. Each state/UT was advised to devise a state specific strategy to achieve this target," it said.The states/UTs were also advised to ensure regular review meetings of the state, district and block task force to assess emerging challenges, understand ground issues and promptly address them at appropriate levels, it said."Every state/UT must schedule all healthcare workers for vaccination at least once before February 20, 2021 and immediately thereafter organise mop-up rounds for them. Similarly, all frontline workers must be scheduled for vaccination at least once before March 6, 2021 and immediately thereafter organise mop-up rounds for them," said the ministry.The Health Ministry said the failure of potential beneficiaries to get vaccinated in the mop-up round would automatically push them to age-appropriate vaccination category.The health secretary also reiterated the need for adequate attention to issuance of provisional digital vaccination certificates after the first dose and final certificate after completing the second dose; importance of authentication of beneficiaries; and timely data reconciliation on CoWIN application.He added that CoWIN 2.0 version will be released soon.

The court also deferred the next hearing of his appeal to February 24.“As there was no need of Khan’s appearance today before the court, he did not appear through video conferencing either,” the actor’s counsel Nishant Bora said.The actor was on Friday allowed by the Rajasthan High Court to appear before the sessions court through video conferencing.“The high court had granted him permission to appear through video conferencing instead of the personal appearance. So in pursuance of this direction, we moved an application in the court today for exemption from appearance and Session Judge Devendra Kachhawaha permitted us,” said Bora.A high court bench of justices Indrajit Mahanty and Dinesh Mehta had on Friday allowed Khan to appear before the sessions court conceding his counsel HM Saraswat’s plea that his client’s personal appearance attracting huge gathering in court premises may cause a law and order issue.Khan had been sentenced to five years’ jail term by the trial court in April 2018 convicting him of poaching two blackbucks on October 1 and 2, 1998, and Khan has challenged this sentence in the district and Session court. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/blackbuck-case-appeal-salman-khan-skips-appearance-before-sessions-court-208826

06-02-2021||Mumbai||Govt shouldn’t have put Lata, Sachin’s reputation at stake: Raj Thackeray||MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Saturday said the Union government should not have exposed Sachin Tendulkar and Lata Mangeshkar to social media trolling by involving them in its campaign to counter tweets by foreign celebrities in support of ongoing farmers’ stir.If American pop star Rihanna and others supporting the agitation against new agriculture laws was interference in India’s internal matters, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s slogan in support of Donald Trump too was problematic, he said.Many celebrities, including cricket icon Tendulkar and legendary singer Mangeshkar rallied around the government on social media using hashtags #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda following tweets by Rihanna and climate activist Greta Thunberg backing farmers.“The Centre should not have asked Sachin Tendulkar and Lata Mangeshkar to tweet in support of its stand and put their reputation at stake. Now they have to face the wrath of social media trolling,” Raj Thackeray told reporters.The government should have limited its use of celebrities in its campaign to actors such as Akshay Kumar, he said.“They (Tendulkar and Mangeshkar) are true legends in their fields, but otherwise very simple persons. They should not have been asked to tweet with the same hashtag. They tweeted what government asked them to tweet, and now they are at the receiving end,” he said.The MNS chief also wondered how many Indians knew who Rihanna was until she tweeted about agitating farmers’ plight.There was no need for the government to ask her to not get involved in the issue, Thackeray opined.“By the same logic, there was no need to hold a rally in the United States saying ‘Agali Baar, Trump Sarkar (next time, Trump government). It was that country’s internal matter,” he said, referring to Modi’s rally in Houston when Donald Trump was US president.Thackeray also said the laws against which farmers are agitating can have some flaws which can be rectified.“If the government wishes to solve the issue, it can sit with farmers’ leaders, hold talks and make necessary changes in these laws,” he said.The MNS chief also said that the new laws must not benefit only a handful of corporates.“I think the laws have some plus points but the Centre needs to discuss them again with state governments,” he said.

Is it wrong to connect with the culture of one’s own country?They (the TMC) want to negate the country’s culture for the sake of vote-bank politics,” he said.Banerjee had declined to speak at the event to celebrate Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary where “Jai Shri Ram” slogans were raised in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Talking about the insider-outsider debate started by Banerjee in the run up to the assembly elections likely in April-May, the BJP chief said the state leadership of his party will protect the culture of West Bengal and steer it to progress.“The Mamata Banerjee government has politicised the administration, criminalised the police and institutionalised corruption,” he alleged.He later flagged off an improvised ‘Rath’ as part of the BJP’s ‘Parivartan Yatra’ to bring about a change in West Bengal from Nabadwip, the birthplace of 15th century saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.He said Union Home Minister Amit Shah will inaugurate two of the other four such ‘Rath Yatra’ slated later this month. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nadda-flags-off-bjps-parivartan-yatra-in-bengal-says-people-have-decided-to-end-tmc-rule-208806

Justice Mishra, now a retired SC judge, had described Modi as “internationally acclaimed visionary”.In his address on Saturday, Justice Shah also said the Gujarat high court was his “karmbhoomi” where he practiced as a lawyer for 22 years and served as a judge for 14 years.Prime minister Modi released a commemorative stamp at the function.Modi also hailed the country’s judiciary, saying it has performed its duty well in safeguarding people’s rights, upholding personal liberty, and also in the situations when national interests need to be prioritised.

Since collection from cess and surcharges is not to be shared with the states, that is why they are being raised," he said.About the vote-on-account, Mitra had said that the state's tax collection had increased 3.57 times since 2011 when Trinamool Congress came to power and its debt/GDP ratio had declined from 40.65 per cent in 2011 to 34.81 per cent at present.Banerjee had presented the Rs 2.99 lakh crore vote-on-account on Friday as the state polls are round the corner.Mitra said fiscal deficit too had fallen from 4.24 per cent to 2.94 per cent in the latest count.The minister said West Bengal's development expenditure had risen six times, capital expenditure 14 times and social expenditure 9.15 times.Expenditure on physical infrastructure had increased 5.58 times since TMC came to power in 2011.According to him, the state government has taken massive strides in developing school and higher education, minority affairs and public works and in health expenditure.

However, the company has denied any breach in its system.The group, with the name of Red Rabbit Team, hacked some Indian websites and posted the data on the web pages of those portals.The hackers shared some links of those web pages on Twitter in a comment over a tweet of cyber security researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia and tagged several media organisations.The query sent to the Indian Army did not elicit any reply but an Army official said: “We are not aware of any such information but it appears to be malicious intent of some inimical elements”.When contacted, Bharti Airtel spokesperson denied any breach of its server.“We can confirm there is no hack or breach of any Airtel system as claimed by this group. Multiple stakeholders outside of Airtel have access to some data as per regulatory requirements. We have apprised all the relevant authorities of the matter to, therefore, investigate this and take appropriate action.”         “This group has been in touch with our security team for over 15 months now and has made varying claims in addition to posting inaccurate data from one specific region,” the spokesperson said.The links shared by the hacker were initially accessible with mobile number, name and address of subscribers but stopped working after sometime.Red Rabbit Team in a message to PTI claimed that it has access to pan-India data of Bharti Airtel through a shell uploaded on the company’s server and will leak more data soon.Rajaharia said that hackers have failed to show any credible evidence of possessing pan-India data of Bharti Airtel and it is also unclear on the way they got subscriber’s data.“The hacker group failed to show evidence that they have a whole India database. Their claim of shell upload may be also fake. The video of SDR portal seems real but only a short portion of data may leak via this. It is still unclear how they got access to whole Jammu and Kashmir subscriber data,” he said.Telecom operators are required to give access to government and law enforcement agencies of subscriber data registration (SDR) portal through which phone numbers and subscribers details can be verified.Rajaharia said that hackers may be from Pakistan.“The website which was used to upload alleged Airtel data was hacked on December 4, 2020 by Mr Clay (TeamLeets - a Pakistani Hacker Group). This indicates that a Pakistani hacker group TeamLeets may be behind this data leak,” Rajaharia said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hackers-allegedly-leak-data-of-army-personnel-using-airtel-network-company-denies-any-breach-208796

They were released later, a local police official said.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding the rollback of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the laws will ensure better opportunities for farmers and bring in new technologies in agriculture. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-rasta-rokos-in-karad-kolhapur-many-farmers-detained-208792

Due to her whims and to satisfy her ego, Mamata Ji did not allow the scheme to be implemented. This has affected over 70 lakh farmers who for the last two years have been deprived of annual aid of Rs 6,000,” he said.Nadda was addressing a rally of farmers during the last phase of the month-long ‘Krishak Suraksha Abhiyan’ and ‘Ek Mutthi Chawal’ campaign which he had flagged off in order to mobilise the farming community in the state in favour of the BJP.The programmes were also a part of BJP’s outreach to farmers to blunt the opposition’s charge that the ruling party and the Modi government were “anti-farmer” following farm protests at Delhi’s border points.Nadda said the prime minister recently inaugurated the 100th Kisan Rail, an initiative that will help farmers transport their produce anywhere in the country with great ease. Lauding the Modi government for its pro-farmer policies, the BJP leader said, it ensured that they got 1.5 times more than the input cost for their produce.“Today, when about 25 lakh farmers of Bengal sent applications for securing the benefits of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme to the central government, Mamata Ji is saying she will implement it. Mamata ji, elections are round the corner. Now, it’s too late,” he said, castigating the chief minister.Nadda said the state’s people have made up their mind to bid “namaste and tata” to Banerjee and her party after the assembly polls.Nadda taunted Banerjee for losing her cool after hearing “Jai Shri Ram” slogans.“When I was coming here I was greeted with ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans. But I don’t understand why Mamata ji gets angry after hearing it. Had you served the farmers well, you wouldn’t have lost your cool,” he said, while referring to the January 23 incident at Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata.Banerjee had declined to speak at the event to celebrate Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary where “Jai Shri Ram” slogans were raised in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Nadda, state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh and other party leaders later had a community feast where they ate a humble lunch of khichdi and vegetable curry while seated on floor with farmers.Amid chants of “Jai Shri Ram”, Nadda also led a road show in Malda.Standing atop a decorated lorry with Dilip Ghosh and others, he showered jubilant supporters with marigold petals and waved to enthusiastic crowds that gathered along the 1 km stretch between Foara More and Guru Rabindranath Tagore’s statue.People watched the procession from rooftops and balconies and were seen shooting videos with their mobile phones.The streets were lined with BJP’s flags and buntings as the cavalcade inched its way through the narrow and crowded streets. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nadda-breaks-bread-with-bengal-farmers-at-community-feast-slams-mamata-for-neglecting-them-208786
06-02-2021||Bengaluru||Anil Kumble faces backlash for supporting government over farmers||A section of Twitter users in Karnataka expressed displeasure over former Indian cricket captain Anil Kumble supporting the government in the ongoing farmers’ protests.Samyukta Karnataka Horata, an umbrella forum of farmers, workers and Dalit organisations in Karnataka, said in its tweet: “More than 100 farmers have died ever since farmer organisations launched protests in Delhi. Even farmers in Karnataka had been protesting against the state and central government amendments to the farm laws, since September. Dear Kumble, did you ever ask these farmers as to why were they protesting? Why are you tweeting now? Your stand in the matter is very painful.”Three days ago, condemning famed popstar Rihanna and activists like Greta Thunberg who had tweeted in support of the protesting farmers, Kumble took to Twitter using the Union government’s hashtag campaign #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda over the ongoing farmers’ protests.Since then, there has been increasing international support for India’s farmers’ movement, with many international celebrities, politicians and social workers openly coming out in support of the Indian farmers.Renowned Kannada writer Srinivasa Karkala said, “Human rights violations are not the internal affairs of any country.” Chetan Krishna asked, “Being a Kannadiga, how could you be a mouthpiece of this vicious government?”Rekha Srinivas, a social activist wrote, “No one said a word when Trump called India dirty. It is amusing to hear all the noise against the international celebrities who are empathetic with the farmers’ cause. May there be some loyalty towards farmers who toil hard to feed you.”Kannada activist Dinesh Kumar said, “Didn’t you think of the prestige and reputation of the country when you read about hundreds of farmers who died because of the cold at the protest sites? Where was your ‘self respect’ when farmers were attacked and fake cases being filed against them? You should be ashamed of yourself for selling yourself to the ruling party.”— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anil-kumble-faces-backlash-for-supporting-government-over-farmers-208782
06-02-2021||Gandhinagar||BJP didn't achieve in 25 years in Gujarat, what AAP did in Delhi in 5 years: Manish Sisodia||Claiming the Aam Aadmi Party was the best alternative for Gujarat, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Saturday said the AAP government in Delhi has revolutionised the health care system as well as the education system in just five years and has achieved what the BJP government in Gujarat has not been able to do in its 25-year rule.Sisodia was in Gujarat to campaign for AAP candidates for the local body elections slated at the end of this month.Talking to the media, Sisodia said: "The five-year period is also a very long period and in just 2 years, the Arvind Kejriwal government in Delhi, by creating 'Mohalla clinics' revolutionised the health care system in such a manner, that not only from national but also from abroad, people came to see how the health care system can work for the common man. Whereas even after 25 years of BJP rule, the common man anywhere in Gujarat cannot feel confident about receiving good health care in the government-run health facilities"."Similarly, the education system is also a total failure in the BJP-led governance in the state, whether it be the state government or the local body-run systems. The role of early child care education and the primary education is very vital in forming the personality of a citizen in his or her career. The BJP, in its 25 years of being in power, has not been able to set up a proper education system in Gujarat. Whereas, the Kejriwal government has set up primary schools in Delhi and the education is far better than that in primary private schools," Sisodia added."So these are the two models of governance, which people have to choose from—one is that of 25 years of BJP-led governance in Gujarat, versus the five-year rule of AAP in Delhi," said Sisodia."People in Gujarat are tired and frustrated due to the corruption in the local body administrations and they have to run from pillar to post in getting their work done. The AAP government in Delhi revolutionised the way government administration works by coming out with historic initiative of Doorstep Delivery. Now the people in Delhi don't have to go to any office, but the administration goes from house to house and provides the citizens all that is required," added Sisodia."The people in Gujarat are fed up with the BJP government, and are looking for an alternative which they don't find in the Congress. We don't see Congress as an alternative. The people in Gujarat even when they vote for the Congress, they get disappointed when the same Congress leaders thereafter join the BJP," said the Delhi Education Minister.The AAP launched its election campaign for the local body elections in Gujarat on Saturday, holding roadshows in Ahmedabad and Rajkot. Sisodia, as the star campaigner of this roadshow, started by visiting Nagarvale Hanuman temple in Hatkeshwar area of Ahmedabad.Sisodia will lead a roadshow in Rajkot on Sunday.Along with Sisodia, AAP MP Sanjay Singh is also in Gujarat to campaign and hold roadshows in Surat. Besides them, 10 AAP leaders will be campaigning in the coming days for the AAP candidates contesting the local body elections for the municipal corporations, municipalities, districts and tehsil panchayats in Gujarat.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-didnt-achieve-in-25-years-in-gujarat-what-aap-did-in-delhi-in-5-years-manish-sisodia-208779

06-02-2021||Peshawar||Owner of legendary actor Dilip Kumar’s ancestral house in Pakistan refuses to sell it at govt rate||The owner of legendary actor Dilip Kumar’s ancestral house in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province has refused to sell it at a rate fixed by the government, saying he would demand Rs 25 crore for the prime location property which is severely undervalued by the authorities.The provincial government last month fixed the price of the four marla (101 square metre) house, declared as a national heritage, in Peshawar at Rs 80.56 lakh. Marla, a traditional unit of area used in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, is considered as equal to 272.25 square feet or 25.2929 square metres.However, the owner, Haji Lal Muhammad, said he would demand Rs 25 crore from the provincial government for the property as and when approached by the Peshawar administration.Muhammad said he had purchased the property in 2005 for Rs 51 lakh after completing all formalities required for transfer of the land and possesses all the documents of the house.He said it was unjust on part of the government to fix the rate at Rs 80.56 lakh for the property after 16 years.The property was very expensive in Mohallah Khudadad qissa Khwani bazar where the rate of one Marla land was above Rs 5 crore, he said, adding that he would demand Rs 25 crore through his lawyer from the authorities for the house.“How can a four marla property be sold in the said area for Rs 80 lakh?” he asked.Earlier, the owner of the ancestral house of Bollywood actor Raj Kapoor demanded Rs 200 crore for the six marla (151.75 square metre) property in Peshawar. The government had fixed the rate of the property at Rs 1.50 crore.Raj Kapoor’s ancestral home, known as Kapoor Haveli, is situated in the fabled Qissa Khwani Bazar. It was built between 1918 and 1922 by the legendary actor’s grandfather Dewan Basheswarnath Kapoor.Raj Kapoor and his uncle Trilok Kapoor were born here. The building, which is in shambles, has been declared a national heritage by the provincial government.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister’s special assistant on information Kamran Bangash said last month that he is hopeful that the provincial government would reach an amicable settlement with the owners of both the buildings for their purchase to convert them into archaeological museums as both structures have already been declared as national heritage buildings.In January, the provincial government approved the release of Rs 2.35 crore to purchase the ancestral houses of the two legendary actors located in the heart of this city.The owners of the two buildings have made several attempts in the past to demolish them for constructing commercial plazas in view of their prime location but all such moves were stopped as the archaeology department wanted to preserve them, keeping in view their historic importance.

06-02-2021||Gurgaon||First women team inducted into CRPF’s CoBRA commando unit||A maiden contingent of 34 CRPF women personnel was on Saturday inducted into its specialised jungle warfare commando force CoBRA, which will soon be deployed in the anti-Naxal operations grid of the country.The Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) was raised under the CRPF in 2009 for undertaking intelligence-based jungle warfare operations. It has been an all-male affair for this unit till now.The majority of CoBRA teams, whose commandos are expected to have tough mental and physical attributes, are deployed in various Maoist violence affected states while a few are based in the north-eastern states for undertaking counter-insurgency operations.A ceremonial event was held at the forces’ camp in Kadarpur village here with CRPF Director General A P Maheshwari witnessing combat drills performed by the chosen women as he underlined that it was important to defeat gender-based beliefs and stereotypes.The personnel, earmarked for CoBRA, have been chosen from the existing six all-women battalions of the force, a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) spokesperson said.“These women will undergo a pre-induction training for three months and subsequently will be embedded with CoBRA units deployed in Naxal violence affected districts of Chhattisgarh like Sukma, Dantewada and Bijapur,” the spokesperson said.An all-women brass band of the country’s largest paramilitary was also commissioned during the ceremony that was held to mark the 35th Raising Day anniversary of its first women battalion.The first battalion, numbered 88, was raised this day in 1986 at a CRPF base in Delhi and the force now has six such units with just over 1,000 personnel in each.           They are deployed for rendering various kinds of law and order duties across the country.The CRPF also has an all-women pipe band that was raised in 2012.Maheshwari lauded the women, saying they are an inspiration for numerous young girls who aspire to do good for themselves and the country. He said these combatants have proved that power is not in the muscles but in the head.“I consider it the failure of leadership if someone says that one cannot do a work that is being done by the other. It is our responsibility to ensure that every effort is made to bring all the personnel to the same level of efficiency.“Women warriors can use their strengths in the operational areas where the force is working,” Maheshwari said addressing the troops.He urged the women personnel to “make their place” in the families of those youth who have gone astray or away from the national mainstream and help in bringing them back.He said the new age warfare is asymmetric, proxy, radicalisation-based, cyber-centric and has “shifted” from the geographical to the human terrain.“ISIS (the banned global terror group) didn’t require to physically cross the border but capture the mind of a Bengaluru techie (to carry out nefarious designs)...every citizen is a soldier and every soldier is a citizen,” the CRPF chief said.He said women personnel can also play an important role in countering the activities of “sleeper cells” and other such elements.The CRPF, with a strength of about 3.25 lakh personnel, is designated as the lead internal security combat unit with its maximum deployment in three major theatres of Jammu and Kashmir, Left Wing Extremism affected states and insurgency-hit areas on India’s northeast. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-women-team-inducted-into-crpfs-cobra-commando-unit-208767

Full support!” Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also slammed the government over the farmers issue by posting on Twitter a picture of the multi-layered barricading at one of the farmer protest sites.“Why are you scaring us with the wall of fear?” she tweeted along with the picture.The Congress had on Friday extended support to the countrywide ‘chakka jam’ called by the farmer unions, saying party workers will stand shoulder to shoulder with farmers in their protest.Earlier in the day, Gandhi attacked the government over a media report that post-budget there had been a rise in prices of petrol-diesel and LPG gas cylinder, saying that the Modi government has disrupted the budget of both the country and of homes.

06-02-2021||---||India caucus co-chief for resolution of farmers' stir||New Delhi, February 6Congressman Brad Sherman, co-chair of the India Caucus – the largest country-specific group in the US House of Representatives – has urged the Indian Government to make sure that the norms of democracy are maintained, protesters are allowed to protest peaceably and to have access to the Internet.Sherman said he had convened a meeting with his other Republican Co-Chair Congressman Steve Chabot, and Vice-Chair Congressman Ro Khanna to speak with India's Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, regarding the farmers’ demonstrations in India."I urged the Indian Government to make sure that the norms of democracy are maintained and that protesters are allowed to protest peaceably and to have access to the Internet, and to journalists. All friends of India hope that the parties can reach an agreement," he said.Sherman’s observations came despite two statements put out by the Ministry of External Affairs detailing the government’s stand.Sherman has supported India on many issues but has opposed some decisions taken during Modi 2.0 such as the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). But in December last year, when the farmers were camping on the outskirts of Delhi, he had said the “farmers’ yearning to be heard is another powerful example of how peaceful protests is one the cherished democratic traditions binding our two countries together”.Once tipped to be the US Ambassador to India, Sherman had on February 1 condemned the destruction of the Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in Davis, California, and also lauded India for supplying Covid vaccines to neighbours.Sherman has supported amendments to the US Arms Export Control Act to put India on par with key NATO allies and has opposed third party mediation in Kashmir suggested by then US President Donald Trump.“Everyone who knows anything about foreign policy in South Asia knows that India consistently opposes third-party mediation in Kashmir,” he had said.However, Sherman has in the past wondered whether the CAA was “a serious legislation or a crackpot idea going nowhere?”Significantly, during his 2019 US visit, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had avoided meeting Pramila Jayapal but had met other Congressmen, including Sherman and Ami Bera.On December 3 last year, Sherman had done another favour by excluding India while co-introducing a resolution to “End enforced disappearances in Asia and globally”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-caucus-co-chief-for-resolution-of-farmers-stir-208722

This means the Delhi Police have a new front to tackle now, the virtual social media accounts and the probe has gone 'International'."The intention of the creators of the tool kits appears to create disharmony among various social, religious and cultural groups and encourage disaffection and ill-will against the government of India. It also aims at waging social cultural and economic war against India," Delhi police said in a statement.Preliminary enquiry has revealed that the 'toolkit' in question appears to have been created by a pro-Khalistani Organisation "Poetic Justice Foundation"."A section of the documents titled "prior action" delineates the following action plan, digital strike through hashtags on or before 26th January, Tweets storm 23rd January onwards, Physical action on 26th January, Watch-out or join farmers' march into Delhi and back to borders," it said.The police believe that the unfolding of events past few days including the violence of 26th January has revealed copycat execution of the 'action plan' detailed in the toolkit.Though the Delhi police believe it to be an "international conspiracy" to defame the country it refrained from naming anyone into the FIR registered under sections 124-A, 153-A, 153 and 120-B IPC and would be investigated by the Cyber Cell.This means that the Cyber Cell of Delhi Police which is already investigating various social media handles within the county for January 26 violence from posting fake or malicious information to violent posts has now expanded its reach and has an additional responsibility of tackling the foreign handles on Twitter and Facebook.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-police-to-approach-google-over-january-26-violence-208713

When the traveller was asked why he was in possession of the pills he stated they were for his friends and they are considered over-the-counter medication in India," the CBP said in a statement.“The nine pounds of pills were seized for unlawful importation of medication. The pills have an estimated manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of approximately USD 96,608,” CBP said.CBP said that as a general rule the Food and Drug Administration did not allow the importation of prescription drugs that were purchased outside the US."Our inspecting officers have the daunting tasks of inspecting items passengers are trying to bring into the US,” said Shane Campbell, Area Port Director-Chicago.“Some passengers try to hide some of their items from our officers, which could prove to be dangerous.

06-02-2021||Washington||No indication that India agreed to forgo Headley's extradition: Rana's attorney||There is no indication that India has given up on the extradition of David Coleman Headley, the Mumbai terror attack accused, attorney of his co-accused Tahawwur Hussain Rana has told a US court.Rana, 59, a childhood friend of Headley, is facing extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. Rana, who has been declared a fugitive by India, is opposing his extradition.In a submission earlier this week before the US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chelonian, opposing his extradition, the attorney of Rana claimed that as of now there is no indication in the record that India has agreed to forgo Headley's extradition to India.“India presumably could have agreed to forgo Headley's extradition in return for his assistance to the United States, but there is no indication in the record that it did so,” the court submission told the court."In fact, the opinion of the Indian prosecutor serving as the government's expert states: "The present opinion is specific to the extradition request in respect of fugitive Tahawwur Hussain Rana. This opinion may not be construed in any manner to indicate that the various extradition requests pending with different sovereign nations in respect of the above-mentioned case which includes the case in respect of Accused No. 1, David Coleman Headley, is either being given up or not being pursued vigorously," said the motion filed by his attorneys.Pakistani-American Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.Rana's attorneys said that the court should not lightly assume (as the government appears to suggest) that the government circumvented its treaty obligation to India through “a sham interpretation” of Article 6 of the India-US Extradition Treaty as part of its deal with Headley.The government's conclusion in Headley's plea agreement that Article 6 defines offences in terms of conduct rather than elements and thus bars Headley's extradition must be taken as its good-faith interpretation of the Treaty's terms, it said.Rana, in the court filing, described his childhood friend Headley as a liar.Headley lied to federal agents, judges, and presumably prosecutors in relation to these cases. After his first heroin sentence (reduced because of his cooperation), he went back to dealing heroin despite promising that he would not.“He disregarded the agents' instructions regarding his dealings with targets and travelled to Pakistan without permission. After his second heroin conviction, he used his status as a DEA cooperator to deflect government scrutiny of his activities with Lashkar and his statements supporting jihad,” his lawyers alleged.

The protesters reached the village on tractors, two-wheelers, four-wheelers as well as on foot, defying prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC.Ahead of the 2022 Assembly elections, this is the fourth major farmers’ meeting in western UP after Muzaffarnagar, Mathura and Baghpat. Sources say BJP’s rivals in the state are trying to make it an agitation regarding rural economy, not just farm economy, by including non-Jats, especially the Dalits.The meeting today was attended by members from “all castes and professions,” they say. So far, the protests against the farm laws have been led by ‘Jats’ and ‘Gujjars’, the land-owning castes.Prof Sudhir Panwar, who belongs to Bhainswal and is affiliated with the Samajwadi Party, said: “The aim is to make it all about rural economy instead of agri economy. After all, non-farming castes in the village are largely dependent on farmers for their income.”Meanwhile, the Haryana Government has extended the suspension of mobile Internet services in Sonepat and Jhajjar districts till 5 pm tomorrow in view of the three-hour “chakka jam” by farm unions.

Putting up a stout defence, BJP members said they aimed to reform the farm sector.They were upfront in appreciating the government’s performance under the leadership of Modi. Taking part in the discussion on Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address, Anand Sharma of the Congress said the current impasse on the laws was due to the “rigidity” of the government in continuing with them.Agriculture is a “state” subject and the Centre enacting farm laws is legally questionable. Also, the laws were passed in the Upper House in an undemocratic manner.Sharma, however, lauded the country’s successful resolve to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, especially manufacturing of the two indigenous vaccines.Binoy Viswam of the CPI, Praful Patel of the NCP and SC Mishra of the BSP among others also demanded withdrawal of the laws. BJP’s Vinay Sahasrabuddhe flayed the Opposition parties for calling the government “arrogant”. He rubbished allegations that the government was not talking to the farmers. “The government has assured that it will put implementation of the laws on hold for one-and-half years.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut alleged that anyone speaking the truth is dubbed as an “anti-national” and that cases of sedition are slapped against those criticising the government. “When the farmers are uniting and fighting for their rights, you see anti-national acts.

The rights to peaceful assembly & expression should be protected both offline & online. It's crucial to find equitable solutions with due respect to #HumanRights for all," it tweeted.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- for over 70 days, demanding a complete repeal of three central farm laws.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of the farmer unions protesting the farm laws, on Friday said there would be no 'chakka jam' in Delhi on February 6 even as it asserted that peasants in other parts of the country will block national and state highways for three hours but in a peaceful way.The SKM had earlier this week announced this nationwide chakka jam on Saturday, saying that farmers would block national and state highways for three hours in protest against the Internet ban in areas near their agitation sites, harassment allegedly meted out to them by authorities, and other issues.Multiple rounds of talks between the Government and the farmer unions have remained deadlocked. The protests at the Delhi borders for repeal of the three contentious agri laws that was enacted in September last began on November 28.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said any protests must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity, and the ongoing efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse."The Parliament of India, after a full debate and discussion, passed reformist legislation relating to the agricultural sector. These reforms give expanded market access and provided greater flexibility to farmers. They also pave the way for economically and ecologically sustainable farming," the MEA said in a statement on Wednesday.In a strong response to the remarks made by foreign individuals and entities, the MEA on Wednesday said the "temptation" of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments is "neither accurate nor responsible".

06-02-2021||New Delhi||Ahead of 2022 UP elections, an interesting new turn being reported amid ongoing farmers’ agitation||Ahead of the 2022 Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, an interesting new turn is being reported amid the ongoing farmers’ agitation in the state.Ruling BJP’s rivals are trying to turn the agitation about “rural economy instead of farm economy” by including all non-farmer castes, especially Dalits, who are considered to be core voters of the BJP in the agitation.A ‘mahapanchayat’ in Bhainswal village in western UP on Friday held a meeting that included members from “all caste and professions” to increase the impact and ambit of the agitation.Thousands of farmers turned up for the meeting in Shamli district amid a growing clamour against the Centre’s agri-marketing laws in the region.So far in UP, the farmers’ protests against the three central farm laws have mostly been about ‘Jats’ and ‘Gujjars’, the agricultural land-owning castes. Farm policy expert Prof Sudhir Panwar, who belongs to Bhainswal village in Shamli district and is also affiliated with the Samajwadi Party, said participants in today’s meeting included people from Muzzafarnagar, Shamli, Saharnpur and Baghpat districts. ‘Khaps’ include people of one caste. In those terms, ‘panchayats’ and ‘mahapanchayats’ being organised in the western UP and Haryana region to lend support to the ongoing agitation are largely limited to ‘Jats’ and their ‘khaps’. “Non-jats are not participating in the agitation because it is limited to agricultural land owners. In UP, land owners in a village generally belong to one caste, whether ‘Jats’ or ‘Gujjars’. The aim of this new movement is to make it about rural economy instead of farm economy. After all, non-farming castes in a village are also dependent upon farmers for their income,” explains Panwar.  In those terms, what has happened today has added a new dimension to the ongoing farmers’ agitation.Non-farming castes, especially Dalits, have of late become core voters of the saffron party and this is the section that leaders of its rivals like the Samajwadi party and the RLD are trying to woo, stressing on “unity among all to protect village economy from pro-corporate policy of BJP governments”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-2022-up-elections-an-interesting-new-turn-being-reported-amid-ongoing-farmers-agitation-208391

The allegations made in the FIR were vague and  the procedure under CrPC and the law laid down by the Supreme Court with regard to arrest weren’t followed.Faruqui – who hails from Gujarat—was arrested on January 1 by the Madhya Pradesh Police for his alleged derogatory remarks against Hindu gods during a show in Indore.He has challenged the January 28 order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court that dismissed the bail pleas of Faruqui and fellow comedian Nalin Yadav.“The evidence/material collected so far, suggest that in an organized public show under the garb of stand-up comedy at a public place on commercial lines, prima facie; scurrilous, disparaging utterances, outraging religious feelings of a class of citizens of India with deliberate intendment, were made by the applicant,” the high court had said while rejecting his bail plea.Maintaining that every right was coupled with duty, the HC said, “Liberty of an individual has to be balanced with his duties and obligations towards his fellow citizens,” the high court had said, adding the State must endeavour to ensure that the “ecosystem and sustenance of coexistence in our welfare society is not polluted by negative forces.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court%C2%A0grants-interim-bail-to-comedian-munawar-faruqui-208310
