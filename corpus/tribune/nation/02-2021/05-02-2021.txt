But the plan to push back at China’s aggression along with allies and partners remained in place but without the unbridled hostility that marked the Trump-Mike Pompeo Administration.Building on a major review of the Afghan policy and the defence posture of US armed forces, Biden ordered an end to arms sales to Saudi Arabia for war against Yemen and indicated a hard line against Russia.Biden saw value in strong alliances to deter Moscow as also China’s “growing ambitions to rival the US.”“America’s alliances are our greatest asset, and leading with diplomacy means standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our allies and key partners once again,’’ he observed.Biden spent less time on China than Russia. Though Washington will confront China on economic abuses and counter its aggressive, coercive actions, Biden said, “we are ready to work with Beijing when it’s in America’s interest to do so.’’This may be because America’s China policy will also undergo a review. But a constant in the Biden-Harris administration -- “ the grounding wire of our global policy’’—will be defending freedom, upholding universal rights and treating every person with dignity. “That’s our inexhaustible source of strength.  That’s America’s abiding advantage,’’ underlined Biden.Though many of these values have come under intense pressure in recent years, the US President said he had spoken about them with America’s “closest friends’’ which he identified as Canada, Mexico, the UK, Germany, France, NATO, Japan, South Korea and Australia. Biden is yet to telephonically speak with PM Narendra Modi.Spending a great deal of time on democracy and its related values, Biden said, “all this matters to foreign policy, because when we host the Summit of Democracy to rally the world to push back the authoritarianism’s advance, we’ll be a much more credible partner because of these efforts to shore up our own foundations.’’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/democratic-tenets-to-be-grounding-wire-of-us-foreign-policy-208390

Commercial vehicles would require the fitness test after 15 years, she announced.If the vehicle was found unfit for road, the owner would be expected to send the vehicle for scrapping. Armane said Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari was working on providing some incentives to encourage owners to send their vehicles for scrapping.The fitness test of the vehicles would be fully automated, Armane said, adding that this would prevent manipulation of findings that could take place if the test was carried out manually. Fully automated fitness test of vehicles were carried out in country already at six centres. Target has been set to increase the number of automated fitness test centre to 27. Armane said the centres would be under private ownership. The machines operational in the country at present are all imported but it was expected that the machines would be soon built indigenously also. If vehicle manufacturers entered into the automated fitness test business, it would be ensured that they were not being partial to vehicles manufactured by their company, Armane said.Armane said that preliminary research had shown that there were 50-60 lakh vehicles in the country at present, which would be required to undertake the fitness test once the policy was notified. It was possible that many of these old vehicles might have been already abandoned by the owners, the Transport Ministry Secretary said.Responding to a question, Armane said that following the introduction of the policy, car sales could go up initially and the enhanced sale could last for five to six years. However, the government announced the policy with a view to help the users who spent hugely more for old vehicles when compared to one that was less old.In the case of cars the excess expenditure on account of an old one could be over Rs 1 lakh annually compared to a relatively new car. Similarly, the difference between running an old lorry and one that was not so old could be up to Rs 8 lakh, Armane said.Reduction in air pollution and enhancement of safety of the occupants of the vehicle would be the other benefits of the new policy, Armane said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ship-breakers-to-be-roped-in-for-car-scrapping-208380

External forces can be spectators but not participants. Indians know India and should decide for India. Lets remain united as a nation. Tendulkar had tweeted on February 3, 2021 with hashtag #IndiaTogether  #IndiaAgainstPropaganda.“Farmers do not know about Twitter. This Twitter politics has started recently and everyone is doing it. What do the farmers know about Greta Thunberg or Rihanna? And you have fielded Sachin Tendulkar against them,” the RJD leader said.Climate and environmental activist Greta Thunberg had come out in support of the farmers’ protest at Delhi’s borders against the Centre’s new agri laws.“We stand in solidarity with the #FarmersProtest in India,” she had tweeted soon after singer Rihanna shared a news article highlighting the Centre’s crackdown on the farmers by cutting off internet services in many regions.“Why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest,” Rihanna had tweeted.Tiwari’s remark came in for sharp criticism from the ruling BJP and its ally JD(U) which demanded an apology from him.However, the RJD distanced itself from the remark, terming it as Tiwari’s “personal opinion”.Condemning the RJD leader’s statement, the BJP and the JD(U), describing it as “absurd and uncalled for”.“Nowadays Shivanand Tiwari is representing a group of frustrated opposition leaders, crazy to grab headlines. His statement on Sachin Tendulakar is absurd and uncalled for. Shivanandji should apologise to the people of the country.“The RJD is free to express grievances and demand Bharat Ratna for anybody but Shivanandji doesn’t have the right to abuse anyone who is conferred with Bharat Ratna. We seriously condemn the statement and demand that Tejashwi Yadav should come up with a clarification on his party leader,” Bihar BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand said.Echoing similar sentiments, Bihar JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said, “Showing respect for foreign celebrities like Greta Thunberg and Rihanna and insulting legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, who is loved and admired by millions of people, can only be expected from a leader of the RJD.”If Tiwari does not apologise, RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav should take stern action against him, Prasad said.Bihar RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwary said, “It is his (Shivanand Tiwari’s) personal opinion which he may have given considering the conditions and sufferings of the protesting farmers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-fielded-tendulkar-to-counter-comments-from-rihanna-thunberg-rjd-leader-208367

It is not even in the Concurrent List. Hence, the Centre’s legislation on the farm laws was legally questionable, he said.He expressed concern at the judiciary’s delays in giving judgments on issues constitutional, like the farm laws and Citizenship (Amendment) Act.He demanded withdrawal of the laws.He said the laws were passed in Rajya Sabha in an undemocratic manner by giving short shrift to parliamentary procedures.Sharma demanded judicial probe into the violence at Red Fort on Republic Day to bring the culprits to book.Sharma, however, lauded the country’s successful resolve to tackle COVID-19 pandemic, especially manufacturing of the two indigenous vaccines against coronavirus.Binoy Viswam of the CPI, Praful Patel of the NCP and SC Mishra of the BSP also demanded withdrawal of the laws.BJP’s Vinay Sahsrabuddhe said the country has scaled new heights and set new milestones in its march toward progress under leadership of Modi.He defended the farm laws, saying they were progressive.He flayed the Opposition parties for saying that the government was “arrogant” in not acceding to demand for repeal of the farm laws.He rubbished allegations that the government is not talking to the farmers on the laws.“The government has assured that it will put implementation of the laws on hold for one-and-half years,” he said.“You also show flexibility,” Sahasrabuddhe said, addressing the Opposition parties.He said the laws were enacted after many discussions in the country, and reports, including the one headed by Montek Singh Ahluwalia which recommended reform of agriculture sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-amps-up-their-stand-against-farm-laws-in-rajya-sabha-208362

It has to be peaceful," he added.Farmers in these two states will sit in dharna in selected places and then hand over a list of their demands to the district administration regarding monies due to the farmers.Meanwhile, the SKM has issued a list of guidelines as per which only national and state highways are to be jammed from 12 noon to 3pm.

It was originally scheduled to come into effect on February 8.Amid demands for rollback of WhatsApp’s new privacy policy, CAIT had on January 16 moved the top court seeking protection of citizens’ right to privacy from WhatsApp and Facebook which now owns the instant messaging service.It had sought a direction to the Government to restrain WhatsApp and Facebook from storing and utilising the works transmitted through the messaging service for any purpose.CAIT had also urged the top court to direct the two companies to allow the Centre to carry out ‘Technical Audits’ of their data centres, where the data of Indian users are stored, so as to retrieve and delete such data of Indian Users.The petitioner demanded that Whatsapp should be directed to roll back its controversial privacy policy and frame guidelines to govern its data sharing with Facebook. Due to this updated policy, the users will now have to compulsorily share all the information that WhatsApp collects, which includes information about the user’s activity on their services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, it pointed out.The petitioner accused the Centre of failing to discharge its constitutional duty of protecting the privacy rights of citizens. Citizen’s personal data is being collected by a foreign entity and is being transferred outside the country, it alleged.“Centre failed to impose necessary and restrictive conditions in the instant case, though on the proposed policy of Whatsapp, European Union’s Antitrust Authority had imposed serious restrictions and fines of 110 million euros in 2017,” read the CAIT petition.In 2016, Germany, the UK and the entire European Union had prohibited similar action of Facebook which was also asked to delete all the data relating to Whatsapp users, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-pil-seeking-withdrawal-of-new-privacy-policy-of-whatsapp-208357

The one-time relaxation will benefit over 3,300 students without even increasing the age-limit, it said.The Bench had earlier asked the Centre to explain why a one-time relaxation can’t be given to civil services aspirants who could not appear in their last attempt in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.“It’s just a one-time relaxation and if it has been done before then why not this time?” it had asked ASG Raju. The Centre had initially opposed the idea, saying allowing an extra attempt to civil services aspirants who could not appear in their last chance in the 2020 examination due to the COVID-19 situation would create a “cascading effect”, detrimental to the overall functioning and level playing field necessary for a public examination system.It had said such a decision in favour of the petitioners would seriously prejudice other candidates. Giving an additional attempt or relaxation in age for some candidates would amount to extending differential treatment to similarly placed aspirants at the examination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-centre-upsc-agree-to-give-extra-chance-to-civil-services-aspirants-208355

05-02-2021||New Delhi||Nails on roads for farmers will turn out to be nails in ‘political coffin’ of BJP: RLD's Jayant Chaudhary||Asserting that farmers will not settle for anything less than the repeal of the new farm laws, RLD vice president Jayant Chaudhary on Friday said the government's "strong arm tactics" would not work against the tillers and the nails being laid on roads for them would turn out to be the nails in the "political coffin" of the BJP.Chaudhary, who has participated in a number of 'kisan panchayats' in western Uttar Pradesh and is campaigning aggressively against the Centre's farm laws, said the government must immediately withdraw the legislations and draft them afresh after taking the consent of farmers.In an interview with PTI, the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) vice president alleged that the current leadership of the country is far removed from sentiments and is not perturbed by riots, deaths or big agitations as it is "cocooned" in its own bubble."It is a totalitarian administration. They are not even listening to their own political people on the ground. If you speak to BJP MLAs or MPs off the record, they are not happy and they can feel the angst rising in the people of India, in the common man who voted for (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi," the former MP said.Chaudhary said he had been to almost every dharna site of the farmers, has sat among them, spoken to them at different levels, addressed 'kisan panchayats', and feels that the farmers have formed an emotional connect cutting across different states like Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh."There is unity, and I don't think that these farmers are going to take anything less than what they have come this far for (which is repeal of the laws)," he said.The farmers have left their villages, walked for miles, have faced so many hardships with "about 150 of them even losing their lives" and they are still not willing to back down even in the face of the government hardening its stance, the RLD leader said.The farmers' stance is very clear and they are saying that these laws are not made for them and they will not accept them, he said.It is always the prerogative of the government of the day to make laws but ultimately it is the people's will that must prevail, Chaudhary asserted.Asked about the multi-layered barricading and iron nails studded on roads at protest sites on Delhi's borders, he said, "These are not nails being put on the roads going to Delhi, these are nails being put into the political coffin that is being made for the BJP." "This is a very hurtful image that has gone out. These are the people who freed Delhi from the British, who fought against the Mughals, whenever there was a crisis in Delhi, it was the farmers close to Delhi in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh that were first there. Today, the Kisan Ghat (memorial of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh), Parliament and Rajghat are in Delhi, and you are forbidding these farmers from even entering Delhi," he said.On the government's offer to suspend the farm laws for 18 months, he said the offer had not found favour with either the protesting farmer organisations or with the farmers themselves."My suggestion is that they (government) should completely do away with these laws and communicate more effectively, reach out to the farmers, if they feel there is a reform that is needed, take their consent and then draft anew," he said.

Her family members failed to find her anywhere in the village, following which they started searching her on the outskirts. They found her lying in a pool of blood in a farm," he said.On being informed, a police team reached the spot and launched a probe. During the investigation, the accused was arrested from the village, he added."Rajak confessed to his crime and he was booked for the rape and murder of the girl. Relevant sections of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention Of Atrocities) Act, and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act were also slapped against him," the official said.According to the victim's family members, he might have committed the crime to settle an old score, he said.Enraged over the rape and murder of the girl, the villagers tried to damage the accused's house, which led to tension in the village.The victim's family members and other villagers staged a road blockade on Friday to demand capital punishment for the accused, the official said."The accused had spent six months in jail for molesting the victim's aunt and returned to the village about 10 days back only," Sharma said.

Thus, the court called for progress report (from police on probe so far))," said advocate Ali Kashif Khan Deshmukh, the complainant in the case.Issuance of process is a legal means by which an accused (against whom a case is filed) is required to appear in court or is given notice of a legal action against him/her.Inquiry under Section 202 of the CrPC is ordered to determine whether a prima facie case is made out and whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.The court posted the matter for further hearing on March 4.According to the complaint, Ranaut's sister Rangoli Chandel had posted an objectionable message on Twitter in April last year, targeting a particular community, following which her account was suspended.Ranaut then posted a video in support of her sister and in the clip allegedly referred to members of a particular community as "terrorists", the complainant said, seeking a police investigation and action against the two.

05-02-2021||---||Actor Sonu Sood withdraws plea from SC against HC order on ‘illegal’ construction||New Delhi, February 5Bollywood actor Sonu Sood on Friday withdrew from the Supreme Court his petition challenging a Bombay High Court order that dismissed his plea against a BMC notice over alleged illegal construction at his residential building in Juhu area of Mumbai.“That is a good advice, Mr Rohatgi. This is absolutely correct advice which doesn’t happen very often. The authorities to decide the application according to law,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said.The CJI’s comments came after Rohatgi said at the very outset that he had advised Sood to withdraw his plea and wait for the BMC to decide his plea for regularisation.While allowing withdrawal of the petition, it observed that no coercive action should be taken against Sood until the civic authorities decided on his plea for regularisation.The BMC alleged that the actor had carried out structural changes in the six-storey residential building “Shakti Sagar”, and converted it into a hotel without taking requisite permissions.The Bombay High Court had last month dismissed Sood’s plea seeking a stay on the BMC notice for the alleged unauthorized construction. Earlier, the Mumbai court had also dismissed his petition.However, the actor – who hit national headlines during the COVID19 lockdown for extended financial help to migrants and arranging buses for their return to their natives villages and towns – denied any wrongdoing and contended he had not carried out any illegal construction at ‘Shakti Sagar.’The BMC had issued the notice to Sood in October last under section 53 of the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act, with regard to alterations made to a six-storey residential building, in Juhu, accusing him of being a “habitual offender,” who repeatedly tried to convert a residential building into a hotel.    The BMC earlier this month also filed a complaint at the Juhu police station, seeking registration of an FIR against Sood for allegedly converting the residential building into a hotel without permission.The complaint was sent to the police after the BMC inspected the building and found that Sood had allegedly not complied with the requisitions and was continuing unauthorised construction even after the notice was served to him in October last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/actor-sonu-sood-withdraws-plea-from-sc-against-hc-order-on-illegal-construction-208333

Now is the time to be a statesmanlike Sardar Patel. Come, let’s all go to the Delhi Borders. I will come with you. Tell the farmers you brought the laws to benefit them but that you are ready to repeal if they feel otherwise. Don’t make it a prestige issue,” the former Punjab Congress chief said in a 15-minute speech during the ongoing debate in Rajya Sabha on the President’s address to Parliament.Bajwa accused the Centre of pushing the farm laws through a “back door” in Rajya Sabha last September. He said the government threw to the winds all parliamentary conventions and constitutional rights of MPs to seek division.“Today the farmers of Punjab, Haryana and UP have lost trust in you because you rushed the law through deceit. What was your hurry to enact the ordinances? You wanted to favour some corporates. That’s why you hastened the laws through the Parliament. The farmers don’t trust your intentions now,” he said.The MP asked the government to delineate the technical difference between suspending the laws for one and a half year and repealing them.“You say you’re ready to suspend the laws. How are the two things different? If you can suspend the laws for a year and a half why can’t you repeal them? Reenact the laws after comprehensive stakeholder consultation,” he suggested.Condemning the Republic Day violence the Congress Rajya Sabha MP from Punjab alleged conspiracy in the January 26 incidents and demanded a time-bound probe by a sitting SC judge into how a section of protesters was allowed to enter Delhi before the time earlier agreed upon with the police.“Who allowed a section to deviate from pre-planned routes?” He asked.Bajwa also recalled the execution of ninth Guru Teg Bahadur for the cause Kashmiri Brahmins.Bajwa said the community had always made sacrifices for the country.“You will teach us nationalism?” he asked, expressing anguish at a section of farmers being labelled as Khalistanis and anti-nationals.The Congress leader questioned the Delhi police act of preventing opposition MPs from meeting the farmers at Ghazipur yesterday asking, “What kind of a democracy is this?”Earlier he accused the Centre of attempts to crush the farmers’ agitation by barricading the protest sites and denying basic facilities to farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/partap-bajwa-seeks-time-bound-judicial-probe-into-r-day-incidents-208332
05-02-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19: Lawyer writes to DHC CJ to extend emergency parole of aged and ailing prisoners||An advocate has written a letter to the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court seeking extension of emergency parole of prisoners who are above the age of 65 years and prone to COVID-19 infection due to some ailments and medical conditions.The lawyer, in his letter sent to Chief Justice D N Patel through electronic mode, said social distancing is not feasible and possible in jails here as they are already overcrowded and the prisons have been extremely affected by the pandemic.Advocate and social activist Amit Sahni said he has come to know that the jail authorities have been asking prisoners, who were earlier released on emergency parole, to surrender at Mandoli Jail with effect from February 7, and they will be quarantined for certain period before being shifted to the concerned jails.“Though the state government claims to have made adequate arrangements but social distancing in jails cannot be maintained in strict sense due to overcrowding,” the letter, which was sent on February 4 evening, claimed.It said Delhi jails have a capacity to retain 10,026 prisoners and presently around 14,000 inmates are lodged there, excluding around 4,000 who were released on interim bail or emergency parole.Sahni also referred to the Supreme Court's January 21 order extending the stay on October 20 last year of the Delhi High Court by which interim bail granted to undertrials in view of the COVID-19 pandemic was put to an end and they were directed to surrender on various dates.The letter said as the matter is scheduled to come up for hearing before the apex court on February 25, the directions issued by the top court relating to extension of interim bail to undertrials should also be applied to the prisoners released on emergency parole.A similar letter has also been sent to Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain.“The situation in Delhi jails is not such that one room/ barrack can be provided to each infected prisoner because a number of inmates are lodged together in a single barrack/ room,” it said.It said the risk of severe illness increases with age due to coronavirus, so the prisoners be directed to surrender in a phased manner -- age, disability and medical condition of prisoners.“The jail administration considering the overall situation must be directed that the prisoners above 65 years of age and those who are suffering from ailments be not asked to surrender for a further period of eight weeks because senior citizens are prone to infection," it said."Further the prisoners who have misused the liberty of emergency parole may be denied such benefit,” it said.

05-02-2021||New Delhi||Wrong to term economic crisis act of God, govt policies responsible: CPI||The CPI on Friday hit out at the government for terming the economic crisis as an act of God, and said the policies of the government were squarely responsible for the situation and not the Almighty.Participating in a discussion on the Motion of Thanks on the President’s address, CPI member Binoy Viswam said the government’s much-touted Rs 20-lakh crore financial package was only a “gimmick” as only around Rs 2 lakh crore reached the people instead.The CPI member did not support the Motion of Thanks on the President’s address. He also urged the government to bring a national employment act on the MGNREGA model and said there should be an employment scheme for addressing the problem of unemployment among the youth of the country.Viswam said the Finance Minister termed the COVID-19 pandemic and the crisis in the economy as an act of God.“How can it be an act of God?” he asked, noting that it was true that the country faced difficulty during the lockdown days but the economy was on the downturn even before COVID-19.In 2020 March, the economy had fallen down to the level of 3.1 per cent GDP whereas in March 2018, it was at 8.2 per cent.He said from 8.2 per cent GDP to 3.1 per cent in March 2020 in the beginning of lockdown, means that under the BJP government the economy was in a “shambles”.“Don’t try to put that blame on God. I am not a believer in God but I believe in the true believers of all religions. I am sure that God is not so cruel. God cannot be so cruel. So don’t put the blame on Gods. God was not the culprit, the culprit was government’s policies,” he said.“So instead of taking the blame for its failures, the government was trying to say that it all happened because of the Gods, which is not a good thing,” the CPI member said.Viswam also said private construction expenditure was 5.1 per cent in 2019-20 and it collapsed to 2.7 per cent in 2020 March and this figure had been the lowest since 2012.On the Rs 20-lakh crore financial package announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the CPI member held that this money did not reach the people of the country.“In fact, it was a gimmick with figures and only Rs 2 lakh crore was disbursed at the maximum and the government is preaching everything that it has spent lakhs and lakhs for the poor to save their interests, which cannot be understood or accepted,” he said.Viswam said corporate profits during COVID-19 rose to the level of 35 per cent and the money of 100 billionaires was enough to give to 138 million poor but the government was not keen on that.

05-02-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Upset with Tendulkar's tweet on farmers, Malayalee netizens regret 2015 criticism of Sharapova||Offended by Sachin Tendulkar’s tweet on farmers’ protest, scores of Keralites flooded tennis star Maria Sharpova’s social media pages with messages, apologising for trolling her in 2015 after she had in an interview pleaded ignorance about the cricket icon.While most messages were apologetic of their previous comments critical of the former World No.1 and lashed out at Tendulkar for his tweet, a few even invited her to come to God’s Own Country to enjoy its scenic splendour and attend the iconic Thrissur Pooram once the coronavirus pandemic ended.Also read: Opposition MPs demand repeal of farm laws in Rajya Sabha“Sharapova, you were right about Sachin, that he is not a person of quality that you should know,” a social media user commented in Malayalam, as was hundreds of other messages in the south Indian language.The 33-year old multiple grand slam winner on Wednesday posted a tweet, saying “Anyone else got their years confused?” after her twitter and Facebook page got flooded with comments in Malayalam once again like in 2015.The netizens were upset with Tendulkar, who along with several Bollywood and other cricket stars rallied around the government in its pushback against support from several global celebrities to the farmers’ protests against new farm laws.Also read: What's the problem if foreign celebrities support farmer stir; don’t know Rihanna, Greta: Tikait“India’s sovereignty cannot be compromised. External forces can be spectators but not participants. Indians know India and should decide for India. Let’s remain united as a nation,” Tendulkar had tweeted.Known as God of Cricket among his fans, the master blaster had posted the message as part of identical tweets on India’s unity posted by celebrities in response to international pop star Rihanna expressing solidarity with the farmers’ stir.Though the tweet of Tendulkar attracted over 2.7 lakh likes, it did not go down well with a large number of Twitterati. Scores of Keralites, including his fans, hit out at their ‘God’ and endorsed Sharpova’s earlier remark about him.The Russian tennis star had faced the ire of Malayalees in 2015 following her comment in an interview that she did not know Tendulkar.But many were back on her wall since Wednesday, apologising for their “crude behaviour” six years ago.Over the thousands of comments in Malayalam, all had a similar pattern of expressing regret to Sharapova for having abused her earlier.“I am sorry, Maria, the legend. We knew Sachin as a player. But we didn’t know him as a person.

Tikait said showing unawareness when asked about the foreigners supporting the farmers' movement.When informed about American pop-singer Rihanna, adult star Mia Khalifa and Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, the Sisauli-born Tikait responded: "They may have supported us, but I don't know them."     "If some foreigner is supporting the movement, then what is the problem. They are not giving us or taking anything away from us," he said.Also read: Opposition MPs demand repeal of farm laws in Rajya SabhaCommenting on the futile attempt by 15 members of Parliament to reach Ghazipur and meet protesters on Thursday, the BKU national spokesperson said the MPs should have sat on the ground on the other side of the barricades where they were stopped by Delhi Police."A barricading has been set up here. They had to come, but they should have sat down there itself. They would have been on the other side and we on this side (of the barricade),” he said.Tikait said he did not have any talk with the 15 MPs who had tried to come to Ghazipur to meet the protesters. They were also not allowed to speak to the protesters, he added.The 15 MPs from 10 Opposition parties, including the SAD, the DMK, the NCP and the Trinamool Congress, wanted to meet the protesters at Ghazipur. Members of the National Conference, the RSP and the IUML were also part of the delegation.MP and Shiromani Akali Dal leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who coordinated the visit, said the leaders were not allowed to cross the barricades and reach the protest site, where thousands of farmers are camping since November with a demand that the government repeal the new agri-marketing laws enacted last September.The farmers’ protest at Ghazipur, Tikri and Singhu at Delhi borders has now attained global spotlight with prominent international celebrities and rights activists talking about the stir.In its pushback, the government said the facts on the issue must be ascertained before rushing to comment on it, and asserted that the "temptation" of sensationalist social media hashtags and views is "neither accurate nor responsible".

05-02-2021||Washington||Mumbai attack accused Tahawwur Rana opposes extradition to India||Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, a key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, has opposed his extradition to India, arguing that he has previously been acquitted of the offences for which his extradition is sought.Rana (59), a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He has been declared a fugitive by India.Pakistani-American Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.The motion in opposition of Rana’s extradition was filed by his attornies early this week before the US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chelonian.Rana’s extradition is barred under Article 6 of the United States-India extradition treaty with India because he has previously been acquitted of the offences for which extradition is sought, and under Article 9 of the Treaty because the government has not established a probable cause to believe that Rana committed the alleged offences, his attorneys argued.The US government, which is supporting his extradition, expected to file its motion soon.“This is the rarest of cases: the government seeks to extradite Tahawwur Rana to India to face the death penalty based on alleged criminal conduct for which an American jury acquitted him,” Rana’s attorneys said.“The US government seeks to accomplish this inequitable result by reading…double jeopardy, provision of the extradition treaty contrary to its text, to international and Indian law, to the interpretation the government gave that provision in its plea agreement with Rana’s alleged co-conspirator, David Headley, and even to United States double jeopardy principles,” they said.The government relies for its required showing of probable cause on the very witness — Headley — whose testimony the American jury rejected. The court should dismiss the extradition complaint and deny the request for extradition, they argued.Rana was previously prosecuted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. He was charged with conspiring to provide material support to terrorism in India.The motion also argues that the US government has failed to establish probable cause to believe that Rana committed the crimes charged in India.It says that the US government relies for its probable cause showing almost entirely on Headley’s direct-examination testimony and other evidence from the Illinois trial, at which Rana was acquitted on India-related charges.The government’s theory has two essential pillars. One, that Headley told Rana he was working with LeT, including in preparation for the Mumbai attack; and secondly, that Rana furthered Headley’s efforts on LeT’s behalf by, for example, opening the Mumbai office of Immigrant Law Centre to provide cover for Headley’s surveillance of potential attack sites and helping Headley obtain a business visa for India through the submission of false documents.His attorney’s claim that Headley lied to Rana about his true plans in Mumbai.“He then brazenly lied to his handler in Pakistan — telling Major Iqbal he was using the $25,000 to pay for the office when in fact Rana was paying for it — to con the Pakistanis out of thousands of dollars,” the motion says.Giving several examples, the motion to oppose extradition says that the government’s probable cause rests on Headley’s uncorroborated and at times demonstrably false testimony.“The Illinois jury rejected that testimony. The government, nonetheless, insists that the court must accept Headley’s testimony at face value, without any inquiry concerning his credibility,” it says.It would be no less of an “unthinkable imposition” on this court’s duty to “determine independently” whether probable cause supports Rana’s extradition if the court had to swallow uncritically Headley’s false testimony, it said.“Probable cause may not be a stringent standard but it requires something more than the say-so of a twice-convicted drug dealer and conman, who has repeatedly and admittedly lied to judges, prosecutors, federal agents, his own family and anyone else necessary to get what he wanted — particularly because what he wanted here was of utmost importance to him: to avoid a death sentence in the United States and his own extradition to India, where he would surely face execution,” his lawyers added.

05-02-2021||Dehradun||Know why Uttarakhand is scrutinising social media behaviour of passport applicants||The Uttarakhand Police have decided to scrutinise social media behaviour before giving their clearance for people applying for passports.Uttarakhand DGP Ashok Kumar said on Thursday that online behaviour of passport applicants needs to be scrutinised to stop growing misuse of social media platforms.The Uttarakhand Police had decided to make examination of social media behaviour of passport applicants a part of the verification process at a meeting chaired by the Director General of Police.Justifying the decision, Kumar said the measure is needed to stop growing misuse of social media platforms to foment trouble.            However, the DGP denied he had introduced anything "new or drastic" saying he had only spoken in favour of enforcing a clause already there in the passport law.            "There is a clause in the passport law not to issue the document to anyone indulging in anti-national activities. I have only spoken in favour of its enforcement," Kumar said.           "As a police officer I stand against anything that falls into the category of anti-national activities as defined by our Constitution," he said.Replying to a question, he admitted that the way social media was used to "escalate tension" during the recent tractor parade in Delhi may have acted as a catalyst or taking the decision."Deterrents like these are necessary to discourage the growing misuse of social media and send a message to users to be more responsible," he said.Earlier, police only checked whether or not FIRs were lodged against passport applicants.However, the decision to add scrutiny of social media behaviour of passport applicants to the police verification process was taken during the police conference where the role of social media platforms in recent times came up prominently for discussions.

This will enable the maximum number of farmers to participate in the movement and also return to the village and engage in farming.According to Tikait, leaders of farmers' bodies are constantly urging the government to talk with them, but the government isn't doing so. "In fact, the government wants to prolong the farmers' agitation." So, Tikait has evolved a formula through which the agitation will attain longevity. In this formula, 15 people from every village should stay at the protest venue for 10 days and then the next lot of 15 should replace them. The first lot of protesters can then return home and tend to the fields.Read also: Opposition tears into govt’s handling of farmers’ protest, says monologue should stopIron nails fixed on roads at Ghazipur border being ‘repositioned’, say Delhi PoliceTikait announced on Thursday: "Work on the formula of one tractor and 15 people for 10 days from every village.

Asked about the resumption of dialogue, Tikait said: "Through the media, we will keep requesting the government for a dialogue. Now it is up to the government to decide how much time it has for the farmers." He said the government is adopting new tactics every day to prolong the farmers' agitation. "Not talking to farmers and turning Delhi into a fortress are part of these tactics.

05-02-2021||New Delhi||Oppn corners govt on handling farm protests, seeks repeal of laws; BJP defends||Opposition parties on Thursday launched a vociferous attack on the Centre over its handling of the farmers’ agitation, callings its dialogues with the protesters “monologues”, even as the ruling BJP defended the new laws asserting that its government is committed to the welfare of peasants and increase their incomes.Attacking the government, Opposition parties said trenches have been dug, barbed wires put up and spikes installed at the sites of farmers’ protests, whereas bridges should have been built to win over them. The BJP highlighted the farm welfare measures and tore into the shifting of goalposts by the Opposition.Participating in the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address, Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda said the government has no right to question the patriotism of farmers as they are the ones who have made the country self-sufficient in food.He hit out at the government saying it should show a big heart and accept the demands of farmers by repealing the farm laws.Resuming the discussion, Manoj Kumar Jha of the RJD said the government has lost the patience to hear and any criticism is painted as anti-national.He noted that one has not seen such an aggressive approach even towards the neighbouring nations who came into Indian territory.“Patriotism is not be worn on sleeves but carried in heart,” he said making use of poetry and sarcasm.Contesting the government’s claim of having 11 rounds of dialogue with agitating farmers, he said its ministers “believe in monologue and not dialogue”.Digvijaya Singh of the Congress lashed out at the government, saying measures like demonetisation to the CAA were “blunders that hit the people hard”.He said the void between the Modi government’s promises and implementation was big and it could not win the hearts of people.Also read: Opposition MPs not allowed to reach Ghazipur protest site: HarsimratBraving rain, Haryana Congress MLAs march to Governor’s House against farm lawsFace-off between BJP, Congress in Rajya Sabha; Scindia, Digvijaya Singh take on each otherWhen PM says he is one phone call away, then who is between him and farmers, asks Deepender HoodaHe said the prime minister had “lost their trust”.“You have got majority but dissent is essence of democracy,” Singh noted.Former prime minister and JD(S) leader H D Deve Gowda called farmers the backbone of the country. He said miscreants and anti-social elements were behind the events on Republic Day and all political parties have condemned their actions and agree that they need to be punished.However, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the government is committed to farmers welfare and will help increase their incomes. He said it will provide Rs 1 lakh crore additional income to farmers that will be generated by converting waste into energy. The minister said the heap of waste at Ghazipur will also be cleaned soon to create energy.Pradhan also said the government has come up with a scheme to procure ethanol worth Rs 20,000 crore which will help increase farmer’s income.He attacked the Congress for not bringing a law on MSP of crops despite being in power for long. “You question those working honestly for farmers’ welfare farmers,” he said.“The Opposition Congress cannot appreciate such government efforts as it has never done except for hailing its dynasty,” he said.“Those born with a golden spoon cannot digest when a tea-seller, son of a woman cleaning utensils in other houses for livelihood, takes reins of the government and that is why they talk against the government,” he said, adding that “the public is watching them”.BJP member Jyotiraditya Scindia said the government has taken a host of steps in the last six years to increase their income.Swapan Dasgupta (nominated) stressed on the need for upgrading in the farm sector.“If we can rise above this basic partisanship and welcome the Centre in the states and states with each other, I think we can be looking forward not merely to a 11 per cent (GDP) growth but a growth which can be 15 per cent which can be envy of the whole world,” he said.Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’Brien pressed the government to repeal the three farm laws and offered a “Repealing Bill 2021’ drafted by him for the purpose.He also demanded a proper inquiry into the death of a farmer during the tractor parade in Delhi on Republic Day.AAP MP Sanjay Singh said his party would continue to support the farmers protesting against three farm laws.He alleged that the current dispensation is just working for the benefit of some of the industrialists.CPI(M) Rajya Sabha member Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya asked the government to withdraw the three contentious farm laws and hold talks with the agitating farmers.He criticised the move to put barricades, cement blocks, concertina wires and spikes at the farmer protest sites on Delhi’s border points.N R Elango of the DMK asked the government to withdraw the three farm laws.Banda Prakash of the TRS asked the government to complete the project promised to Telangana during the reorganisation of Andhra Pradesh.Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) MP M V Shreyams Kumar on Thursday said the government has remained a mute spectator while democracy is being “butchered” just a few kilometers away from the Rashtrapati Bhavan.Earlier Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy introduced a new Bill - The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2021.

It defended the cutting off of Internet as a measure aimed at preventing a repeat of the violence at Red Fort on January 26 “which evoked a similar reaction in India as did the incidents at Capitol Hill”.Read also: Internet ban in Sonepat, Jhajjar extended till Friday eveningAsked at the weekly media briefing whether the Foreign Office taken up with the State Department its statement on the farmers’ agitation that came after the MEA had already stated the Government’s position, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said, “We have taken note of the comments of the US State Dept and what we would say it is important to see them in context they are made and in their entirety.”Also read: Opposition MPs not allowed to reach Ghazipur protest site: HarsimratNails fixed near barricades on Ghazipur, Tikri borders being removedBraving rain, Haryana Congress MLAs march to Governor’s House against farm laws“Any protests must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos and polity, and the ongoing efforts of the Government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse,” he said, indicating that the door for talks was open.While pointing out that both India and the US are vibrant democracies with shared values, Srivastava said the incidents of violence and vandalism at Red Fort on January 26 have evoked “similar sentiments and reactions” in India the incidents on Capitol Hill on January 6. They are being addressed “as per our respective local laws,” he observed.Happy to share that I’ve donated $10,000 to provide medical assistance to the farmers in need in India to help save lives during these times. I hope we can prevent any additional life from being lost. 🙏🏾 #FarmersProtest https://t.co/0WoEw0l3ij  The temporary measures with regard to internet access in certain parts of the NCR region were therefore undertaken to prevent further violence, he added.Earlier in the day, the US State Department called for observing human rights and rules of fair play while supporting the general trajectory of the three farm laws.“We recognise that unhindered access to information, including the internet, is fundamental to the freedom of expression and a hallmark of a thriving democracy,” in response to a question on the ongoing farmers’ protests in India and called for resolving differences through dialogue.  Solidarity with all the farmers across India protesting for their livelihood.India must protect their basic democratic rights, allow for the free flow of information, reinstate internet access, and release all the journalists detained for covering the protests. https://t.co/uOvwNkIu5n  “In general, the US welcomes steps that would improve the efficiency of India’s markets and attract greater private sector investment,” added Ned Price, the State Department spokesperson“We recognise that peaceful protests are a hallmark of any thriving democracy and note that the Indian Supreme Court has stated the same,” he emphasised.The State Department and several politicians from the US, UK, Canada and Australia have sought a resolution of the farmers’ agitation.The tweets by some celebrities in the West, prompted the MEA to advise them to fully understand the intent of the farm laws before rushing to comment.New Delhi says the three farm laws will give greater flexibility and freedom to sell farm produce but the protesting farmers claim they are heavily weighted in favour of the corporates.The State Department as well as the celebrities have stressed on the shutting off the Internet services and police intimidation after a small group of farmers went off course during the January 26 Tractor March into Delhi and indulged in vandalism at the Red Fort. The Haryana government has since restored Internet services in parts of the state but not at the protest sites of Singhu and Tikri. The Internet is also shut at Ghazipur, on the border with Delhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-negotiating-with-farmers-says-mea-in-response-to-us-statement-207856
