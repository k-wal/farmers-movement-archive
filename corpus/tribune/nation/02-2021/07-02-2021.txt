07-02-2021||---||We need to find solutions to such natural disasters on national scale: former Uttarakhand CM Harish Rawat||Ghazipur, February 7Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat said on Sunday that it was important to find solutions to these disasters on a “national scale”.Rawat, who was in Ghazipur to show his solidarity with the ongoing farmers' protest, said:  “What happened today is tragic. Those who are still missing are hopefully found to be safe and get rescued”.He said it was important to find a way to deal with natural disasters.   “Natural disasters happen but what you do to react is the most important aspect during such times… Uttarakhand faced a bigger disaster in 2013 when 60-70 per cent of places were destroyed. We fought it and a new and stronger Uttarakhand came out from that tragedy. And we will recover from this latest tragedy as well,” he said. “But we need to find solutions for these disasters at a national scale,” he added.Over 120 people still remain missing after a glacier at Nanda Devi broke off in Chamouli in Uttarakhand, c triggering an avalanche and a deluge in the Alaknanda river system. The flood washed away hydroelectric stations and trapped more than 100 labourers.Those missing are feared dead. Rescuers have so far found 10 bodies.The disaster brought back memories of flood caused by cloud burst in Kedaranath in 2013 that killed over 5,000 people and left lakhs stranded.Rawat, meanwhile,  brought the soil, water and plants from Uttarakhand to show solidarity with farmers.“Rakesh Tikaitji had called that farmers will plant flowers and plants on those places where they (Govt) have put nails. And today Uttarakhand has sent its soil, water and plants,” he said.The former CM, who is also the front runner to lead the Congress in the 2022 state elections, said he had yet to speak to his successor, the current Chief Minister of Uttarakhand Trivendra Singh Rawat, after Sunday’s tragedy. “I have not spoken to the current CM but I think he and his officials together must be busy overseeing rescue and relief efforts. When I handed over the reins by then we had constituted four battalions of SDRF, which were made on the lines of NDRF and I think they are doing great work,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-need-to-find-solutions-to-such-natural-disasters-on-national-scale-former-uttarakhand-cm-harish-rawat-209213
07-02-2021||Kolkata||Some Netaji relics at Victoria Memorial exhibition fake: Expert||Netaji’s grandnephew Sugata Bose has questioned the authenticity of some relics at an ongoing exhibition at the Victoria Memorial here, commemorating the 125th birth anniversary of the legendary freedom fighter.Bose, also the chairperson of Kolkata-based Netaji Research Bureau, has written to Victoria Memorial curator Jayanta Sengupta on Saturday, saying the museum authorities had never asked for a copy of the letter of freedom fighter’s resignation from the Indian Civil Service.He urged the Victoria Memorial authorities to “immediately take down the fake copy” and said “more shockingly Netaji Research Bureau is mentioned as the source below this fake” item.The Harvard University professor also claimed the authentic photocopy of the letter of Netaji’s resignation from the ICS has been with the bureau for about 50 years.“You never asked us for Netaji’s resignation letter or anything else and we supplied nothing to you directly. Sisir Kumar Bose and Krishna Bose had found Netaji’s original letter of resignation in his own handwriting and signed by him to the Secretary of State for India in the India Office of Records of London in September 1971.“They obtained an authentic photocopy which was published in facsimile for the first time in Krishna Bose’s book ‘Itihaser Sandhane’ and has been displayed in the Netaji Bhawan for nearly 50 years,” Bose said in the letter.“You should also investigate who produced the fake item as it is extremely embarrassing that the Prime Minister of India inaugurated the exhibition with the fake item on display,” he said.Bose also asserted that the photographs “apparently displaying Netaji disguised as Md Ziauddin are also fakes”.No photographs of Netaji in disguise were taken or allowed to be taken during his “mahanishkraman” or the great escape, the research bureau chief claimed.“While it appears that the originals of many photographs and facsimiles of letters and documents exhibited by you are indeed from the archives of Netaji Research Bureau collected with the dedicated effort of more than six decades, Victoria Memorial never contacted NRB to seek help with your exhibition.“I am puzzled therefore about the basis on which you have given acknowledgements,” Bose mentioned in the letter.Expressing his disappointment over Victoria Memorial’s conduct in mounting the exhibition, Bose said, “This is no way to honour our great leader.”The Victoria Memorial is under the administrative control of the Union Ministry of Culture.The curator of the museum could not be contacted for comment despite several attempts.No one from the ministry was available for comment.The Netaji Research Bureau chairperson told PTI on Sunday that he has so far not received any response from the Victoria Memorial authorities on the issue.‘Nirbhik Subhas’ (Irrepressible Subhas), a multimedia exhibition, celebrating the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji began at the Victoria Memorial for the public from January 28.“The exhibition contains 125 stories on Netaji in celebration of his 125th birth anniversary,” the museum authorities had earlier said.“These stories are shared through 125 original artefacts, pictures, replicas and objects sourced from across the world, making the viewer reflect on Netaji’s ideals and beliefs in contemporary times,” it added.

07-02-2021||Charkhi Dadri (Haryana)||No ‘ghar wapsi’ till farmers’ demands are met: Tikait||Asserting that the agitation against the Centre’s farm laws is a people’s movement that will not fail, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait on Sunday said there will be no “ghar wapsi” till protesting farmers’ demands are met.Tikait lauded the role of “khap panchayats” (caste councils) and their leaders in supporting the farmers’ stir.Addressing a “Kisan Mahapanchayat” near here, Tikait said the government should rollback the contentious farm laws, frame a new legislation to assure the continuation of the minimum support price (MSP) for crops and release the farmers arrested recently.“There will be no ‘ghar wapsi’ till farmers’ demands are met,” he said.“Yeh jan andolan hai, yeh fail nahi hoga (this is a people’s movement, this will not fail),” he added.Tikait claimed the campaign against the agriculture laws is going strong.                                  Dadri MLA and chief of the Sangwan Khap, Sombir Sangwan, who in December withdrew support to the BJP-JJP government in Haryana, and another Independent MLA, Balraj Kundu, were also present at the event.Earlier on February 3, Tikait had addressed his first “Kisan Mahapanchayat” in Jind’s Kandela.The BKU leader from Uttar Pradesh has been camping at Ghazipur on the Delhi-UP border as part of a campaign by farmer unions against the central laws enacted in September.Tikait said “khaps” go back to the days of King Harshvardhana and have been playing their role in society ever since.“We need these khap panchayats today. You should not let anything divide you,” he said, adding that when the stir started, attempts were made to divide farmers.Cautioning the protesting farmers against such attempts, Tikait said some people will try to divide them in Sikh or non-Sikh, Jats or non-Jats, but they should remain united.Tikait said he salutes the 40 farmer leaders spearheading the agitation. There is not a single weak link in the agitation, he claimed.Seeking to project unity among farmer unions, Tikait said the “manch (stage) and panch (leaders leading the stir) will not change”.The BKU leader, whose emotional appeal recently had revived the protest that was losing momentum after the January 26 violence in Delhi, said people from different sections of society are part of the stir.Tikait praised BKU leader from Punjab, Balbir Singh Rajewal, who was present on the occasion, for providing a sound leadership to the stir.“Rajewal is our elder leader, he is very wise. We will fight this battle strongly,” he said.Hitting out at the Centre, Tikait said, “This government is pro-capitalist.”                Tikait also made a mention of the tragedy caused by a glacier burst at Joshimath in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, leading to a massive flood and causing large-scale devastation in the upper reaches of the ecologically fragile Himalayas.“A big tragedy has struck Uttarakhand. I appeal to the BKU family and other farmer organisations to lend a helping hand and assist the local administration,” he said.He appealed to all to conserve water and plant trees to protect the environment.Taking a lesson from the Jind Mahapanchayat where the stage had collapsed, the organisers had brick-lined the stage this time.Meanwhile, another “Kisan Mahapanchayat” was organised at Sunehda in Nuh district, where Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni accused the government of being stubborn and not considering farmers’ demands.The laws will destroy farmers, Chaduni said at the event, which was attended by Congress leader Aftab Ahmed. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-ghar-wapsi-till-farmers-demands-are-met-tikait-209210

07-02-2021||Lucknow||UP govt announces 16-digit Unicode to identify landholdings||The Uttar Pradesh government has introduced a system of issuing a unique 16-digit Unicode to mark all kinds of landholdings in the state, an official said on Sunday.Every piece of land in the state will have its own unique identity from now onwards that would check cases of land disputes and save people from falling into the trap of fraudsters, an official spokesman said.The revenue department will be issuing the Unicode for marking all kinds of agricultural, residential, and commercial land and a person will now be able to know the details of the land with a single click, he said.The Unicode number of the land will be 16 digits with the first six digits based on the population of the land, the next 4 digits determining the unique identity of the land. The digits from 11 to 14 will be the number of the division of the land. The last 2 digits will have the details of the category, through which, the agricultural, residential and commercial land will be identified.The Unicode will put an end to fake registries of disputed land and the scheme is being implemented across the state. The work has started in most of the districts.While the Unicode assessment for plots has started in all revenue villages, the work of marking the disputed plots in the computerised management system is being done by the revenue courts, he said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-govt-announces-16-digit-unicode-to-identify-landholdings-209208
07-02-2021||New Delhi||‘Tractor revolution’ buzz word as farmers oppose old NGT order to ban diesel vehicles||Farmers protesting against the Centre’s new agricultural laws are rallying behind the call for a ‘tractor revolution’, while expressing disappointment over a 2014 NGT order banning diesel vehicles, including tractors, older than 10 years in Delhi-NCR.‘Tractor Kranti (revolution)’ became a buzz word after farmer leader Rakesh Tikait’s call on Saturday for mobilising support of tractor-owners for the ongoing stir against the contentious agri-marketing laws.During a speech to supporters at the Ghazipur protest site Saturday, Tikait reached out to the farming community, many of whom, especially in the Delhi NCR, have been upset over the National Green Tribunal’s order.The November 26, 2014, order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) stated that any petrol vehicle older than 15 years and diesel one older than 10 years shall not be permitted to ply on the roads in Delhi-NCR.Among others, farmers in western Uttar Pradesh districts like Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Hapur, Shamli and Meerut have been apprehensive of the decision.“As per this order, my tractor which I bought eight years ago will go out of use after two years or at max, after seven years if the 15-year rule is imposed. It will be a huge loss,” Muzaffarnagar resident Vikas Kadiyan, who owns 40 bigha land, said over the phone.The NGT order came into focus again after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech on February 1 announced the much-awaited voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and polluting vehicles.Sitharaman had said that under voluntary vehicle scrapping policy, personal vehicles would undergo a fitness test after 20 years while commercial vehicles would require it after completion of 15 years. Other fine details about the policy are still awaited.Opposing the NGT order, Tikait had told the crowd on Saturday, “The tractors which run in the farms will now run at the NGT’s office in Delhi also. Until recently, they had not asked which vehicles are 10 years old. What is their plan? Phase out tractors older than 10 years and help the corporates? But the tractors older than 10 years will also run, and the movement (for repeal of the new farm laws) will also be strengthened.”                          He said more and more farmers across the country will participate in the ongoing farmers’ stir for rollback of the contentious farm laws.“Recently, 20,000 tractors were in Delhi and the next target is taking that number to 40 lakh,” Tikait had said.The order’s implications have been felt far and wide in parts of the national capital region, which altogether comprises 23 districts from the three states of Haryana, UP, Rajasthan and the entire national capital territory of Delhi, spanning about 55,083 sq km, according to the NCR planning board.Farmers say that a one-line response to the decision is not easy and suggest that a broader perspective is required to order phasing out of tractors. Not all farmers can afford to buy new tractors, and the old ones are generally 15 to 20 years old, they say.“Before such a decision is implemented, it would have been better if the NGT had asked the government in Delhi to replace all their old vehicles and see how difficult and expensive the process could be. Also, train engines running on diesel should be stopped and aircraft stopped in Delhi, if environment is the real concern,” the 38-year-old Kadiyan said.Farmers say tractors are not only used for tilling farmlands but also in transportation e.g. carrying sugarcane to sugar mills in western UP.Instead of a blanket ban, the status of vehicles could be checked individually and documents like Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate be reviewed to decide which ones should go off the roads, they added.Manji Singh Rai, the President of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Doaba) said, “Tractors are like our sons. We don’t drive tractors in the city. We work with them in the fields. Farmers use tractors for 20-25 years. They do not have money to buy new ones.”  “If the government is so concerned about old vehicles, it should provide new tractors to the farmers,” he said about government’s proposed vehicle scrapping policy.Ranjit Singh, a farmer protester from Monga, said, “The government brings only those laws that are against the farmers. Tractor is not just a machinery for us, it’s like a family member for us that helps us earn our livelihood.“The tractors run fine for 20 years. With a little more care and maintenance, they can be used for 25-30 years.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tractor-revolution-buzz-word-as-farmers-oppose-old-ngt-order-to-ban-diesel-vehicles-209205
07-02-2021||New Delhi||At Singhu border, Rakesh Tikait's cutouts, posters & badges of farmers stir draw crowd||The demand for cutouts of Rakesh Tikait at Singhu border underlines the growing popularity of the farmer leader credited with reviving the farmers' movement against the Centre's farm laws following violence during a tractor rally on Republic Day.  Roadside stalls selling badges, posters and other literature related to the farmers' stir are a common sight at Singhu border.Wasim Ali, who has set up such a stall at the protest site, says hand-held cutouts of Tikait are a big hit among the crowd."Each cutout of Tikait is priced at Rs 20. I have been selling the cutouts since the last few days as they are in high demand," he said.Around 700-800 such cutouts are sold every day, said Ali, a resident of Bawana in north west Delhi."I usually buy these cutouts from Sadar Bazar and sell them here. These are the most demanded items at my stall," he added.Tikait's image received a massive boost after he defiantly announced to continue the agitation, even as a large posse of Uttar Pradesh police personnel gathered at Ghazipur protest site after the Republic Day violence, with rumours rife that he might be arrested.A section of protesting farmers had entered Delhi and reached up to ITO and Red Fort in the heart of the national capital during their tractor rally on January 26. In clashes between police and farmers, scores were injured and property, including buses, were vandalised.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader was unwell when a large number of UP police personnel gathered at Ghazipur border where he had been camping for over two months in protest against the contentious farm laws.A cornered Tikait, however, addressed a huge crowd at the protest site, which has now become a focal point of the agitation, after his teary-eyed speech was beamed by news channels amid dwindled presence at Ghazipur border after the January 26 violent clashes.He had reaffirmed the resolve of the farmers, saying "they won't relent or retreat".Tikait's emotional appeal galvanised thousands of farmers from western UP as well as Punjab and Haryana, who took to road to join the agitation that had faced the threat of petering out in the wake of the January 26 episode.

07-02-2021||Dehradun||Glacial burst in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district grim reminder of 2013 Kedarnath deluge||The massive flood in the Dhauli Ganga river triggered by a glacial burst in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district on Sunday came as a grim reminder of the Kedarnath deluge of 2013 which led to widespread devastation in the ecologically fragile Himalayan region.A devastating natural disaster in the form of torrential rains of unseen magnitude had struck Kedarnath on June 16-17 in 2013.The banks of the Chorabari lake in Kedarnath collapsed due to a cloudburst that had resulted in a major flash flood causing widespread destruction in Uttarakhand and led to heavy losses to infrastructure, agriculture lands, human and animal lives.However, unlike the Kedarnath tragedy which struck after a downpour, the flash flood on Sunday occurred on a bright and sunny morning which helped in relief and rescue operations by police, State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) personnel in the affected areas.Contrary to the bad weather that delayed launch of relief and rescue operations after the Kedarnath deluge whose magnitude could not be immediately realised, the clear weather on Sunday allowed helicopters to reach the affected areas quickly.Uttarakhand DGP Ashok Kumar said all efforts at the moment are focused on tracing those who went missing after the flood.Over 150 labourers working at a power project in Tapovan-Reni are feared dead, an Indo-Tibetan Border Police spokesperson said while quoting the project-in charge. Three bodies have been recovered so far.According to the Uttarakhand police chief, the power project has been swept away completely.Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat also lost no time in rushing to the affected areas of Tapovan and Raini to take stock of the situation on the ground. He said relief and rescue operations are being carried out on a war footing in the affected areas.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah are constantly in touch with the chief minister assuring of all possible help.Homes along the way of the deluge were swept away as the waters rushed down the mountainsides in a raging torrent. There were fears of damage in human settlements downstream, including in heavily populated areas. Many villages were evacuated and people taken to safer areas.Connectivity with some border posts was “totally restricted” due to a bridge collapsing near Reni village, an ITBP spokesperson said.

In over two-and-half hours of discourse with the party leadership KCR addressed all issues ranging from party membership, the constitution of the party committees from village level to the state level, etc. The party’s membership drive will commence from February 12, while the party’s annual meeting has been scheduled for April 27 when the party President will also be elected. For the membership drive, KCR told his party leaders that BJP was fast filling up the vacuum caused by the marginalisation of the Congress party in the state, so TRS increase its membership from the current 60 lakhs. Every MLA has been asked for an enrolment of at least 50,000 members. Party sources said KCR also discussed the upcoming elections for two MLC Graduates Constituencies, Nagarjunagar by-poll and also municipal elections to around six Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).  He is said to have clarified that the names of candidates for the posts of the GHMC Mayor and the Deputy Mayor will be announced in a sealed cover on the day of election. He instructed the TRS corporators and ex-officio members to support the candidates announced by the party leadership.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-chief-minister-puts-to-rest-speculations-over-quitting-209199

07-02-2021||Haldia (WB)||People expected ‘mamta’ from Mamata but got ‘nirmamta’: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday slammed the Mamata Banerjee government for not implementing several central schemes in West Bengal, saying people expected her to show ‘mamta’ (affection) but got ‘nirmamta’ (cruelty).At his first public rally in the poll-bound state here, Modi tore into the TMC government, accusing it of “corruption and misgovernance”, and said the ruling dispensation committed “several fouls” in the last 10 years because of which the people have decided to oust it from power.“Bengal expected ‘mamta’ (affection) from Mamata Banerjee but got ‘nirmamta’ (cruelty) in the last 10 years... The TMC government is just a rebirth of the misrule of the Left Front government in the state,” he said.Mocking Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for getting angry over slogans of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’, Modi wondered why she remained silent when conspiracies were hatched to malign the country.“She gets angry when she hears slogans hailing the motherland. She gets angry when you demand your rights. But she remains silent when conspiracies are hatched to malign the nation,” he said.“There are some conspirators who’re trying to destroy India’s image associated with tea and yoga—made famous by iconic Indians—all across the world. Has Didi spoken anything about these conspirators? The country will respond to such conspiracies with all force at its command,” he said.Accusing the TMC of criminalising politics, institutionalising corruption and politicising civil administration and police, he exuded confidence of forming the next government in West Bengal.“The people of Bengal have made up their mind to elect a BJP government in the next assembly polls. In the first cabinet meeting of the BJP government, a decision will be taken to implement all central schemes in the state,” he asserted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/people-expected-mamta-from-mamata-but-got-nirmamta-modi-209191
07-02-2021||New Delhi||Jal Shakti Ministry makes a push for implementation of Centre’s Gobardhan scheme||The Union Jal Shakti Ministry has made the push for effective implementation of Centre’s “Gobardhan” scheme. It launched a “unified” portal on it to ensure transparency and social accountability in its implementation.The portal was launched by Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh. The Union Minister for Petroleum Dharmendra Pradhan and Minister for Animal Husbandry Giriraj Singh were present on the occasion.The Gobardhan scheme aims to support villages in effectively managing their cattle and biodegradable waste.It is expected to help enhance farmers’ income by converting biodegradable waste into compressed biogas (CBG). Launched in 2018, it is being pursued as a priority programme under the Swachh Bharat Mission Grameen-Phase 2 by the Ministry’s Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation. “The new portal will provide information related to the scheme and assistance provided towards it by other ministries such as petroleum, agriculture, animal husbandry and the MSME,” Shekawat said.On the occasion, Pradhan said the scheme will provide farmers an alternative income of at least Rs 1 lakh crore in the next five years by converting rural waste into ethanol, biogas and biodiesel.The Petroleum Ministry will provide guaranteed offtake from these CBG plants under public-private model at a minimum price to provide farmers additional income through the scheme. The minimum price will be revised every year.Pradhan said that the new portal will give entrepreneurs information on finances related to the establishment of CBG plant such as interest subvention by the agriculture ministry, slurry manure purchase by animal husbandry ministry, along with gas purchase by the petroleum ministry.The Reserve Bank of India has categorised financing for the CBG plants under this scheme as a priority sector lending. The State Bank of India has been nominated to finance them.Around 650 entrepreneurs have already submitted letters of intent for establishing CBG plants and two municipal corporations have signed a contract with the petroleum ministry to provide 2,500 metric tonnes worth of CBG.“This will be the priority scheme of the ministry under its effort of taking India ahead toward Open Defecation Free Plus,” Jal Shakti Secretary Pankaj Kumar said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jal-shakti-ministry-makes-a-push-for-implementation-of-centres-gobardhan-scheme-209188

One rally will be held at Peelibanga in Hanumangarh and the other at Padampur in Sriganganagar. Farmers will reach the venue by taking out tractor rallies.Dotasra said the Congress has always expressed confidence in the farmers and the farmers reciprocate well. While the BJP government at the Centre was formed with the promise of doubling the income of farmers and gained support to win the polls, but after coming to power, the BJP forgot the farmers and started working for the capitalists, he said.The Congress will try to strengthen the farmers’ movement to demand the withdrawal of the three agricultural laws, he said.Farmers have been agitating on roads along with their families for more than two months, but the Central government is not ready to accept their genuine demands, he said.Rahul ji is coming to raise the voice of the farmers in the state and to play the bugle of the movement in west Rajasthan that has also got a lot of farmers’ families who had migrated from the east or west Punjab province, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-to-address-farmers-rallies-in-rajasthan-209185
07-02-2021||---||Experts say climate change behind Uttarakhand glacier break off||Vibha SharmaTribune News ServiceNew Delhi February 7Experts are citing climate change as the reason behind the flood caused by a glacier breaking off in Uttarakhand, a “rare incident” by any measure according to them. Prima facie this looks very much like a climate change event as the glaciers are melting due to global warming, says Anjal Prakash, the lead author of the ongoing 6th Assessment report of IPCC.Temperatures are rising in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan region and the rise in global temperature will have more impact in the Himalayan region due to elevation-dependent warming, he says citing reports  Prakash says the IPCC’s Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) reports that climate change has altered the frequency and magnitude of the natural hazards”.  “The scientist reported with medium confidence that in some regions snow avalanches involving wet snow have increased while the rain on snow floods have also increased at lower elevations in springs.  We do not have the data now to give you information on what has caused the avalanche in the Chamoli district but what we know, prima facie, is that this looks very much like a climate change event as the glaciers are melting due to global warming,” she said.“The impact of global warming on glacial retreat is well documented. The recent assessment report called the HI-MAP report facilitated by ICIMOD has also pointed these out. The report shows that temperatures are rising in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan region and the rise in global temperature will have more impact in the Himalayan region due to elevation-dependent warming. If the world can keep the temperature rise to below 1.5°Celsius, in the HKH region it would translate to at least a rise of 1.8°C, and in some places, above 2.2°C. Himalayan regions area also the least monitored region and this event actually shows how vulnerable we could be”. Prakash suggests that the government should spend more resources in monitoring the region better so that we have more information about the change process.“The result would be that we are more aware and could develop better adaptation practices,” he said.Anjal Prakash is the Research Director and Adjunct Associate Professor at the Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad. Meanwhile, Farooq Azam, Assistant Professor, Glaciology and Hydrology, IIT Indore, says: “It’s a very rare incident for a glacial burst to happen. Satellite and Google Earth images do not show a glacial lake near the region, but there’s a possibility that there may be a water pocket in the region. Water pockets are lakes inside the glaciers, which may have erupted leading to this event”.“We need further analysis, weather reports, and data to confirm if this indeed was the case. It is unlikely that this was a cloud burst since weather reports in Chamoli district show sunny weather till today with no record of precipitation. There is no doubt that global warming has resulted in the warming of the region.” “Climate change-driven erratic weather patterns like increased snowfall and rainfall, warmer winters have led to the melting point of a lot of snow. The thermal profile of ice is increasing, where earlier the temperature of ice ranged from -6 to -20°C, it is now -2°C, making it more susceptible to melting.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/experts-say%C2%A0climate-change-behind-uttarakhand-glacier-break-off-209184

Last month, she lodged an FIR in which the cleric was also named as one the accused.The cleric subsequently filed for an anticipatory bail, saying in the marriage form, the complainant’s age was mentioned as 18 and believing that both the parties are adult, he performed their ‘nikah’ as per the Muslim tradition.Hence, he has been falsely accused in the case, registered under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, he said.The judge in her order said the applicant’s role is limited to the extent of performing the marriage rituals.Hence, he is entitled for grant of anticipatory bail on certain terms and conditions, the court said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-cleric-gets-pre-arrest-bail-in-child-marriage-case-209174

07-02-2021||New Delhi||Why surging Ether cryptocurrency is next best bet after Bitcoin||As the surging Bitcoin grabs most of the headlines, Ether or Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency, is touching record valuation and could still be bought cheaper—for nearly Rs 1.16 lakh or $1,600 for one Ether.According to industry players, Bitcoin which is hovering around $40,000 is beyond the reach for most investors while Ether that has touched an all-time high is still within reach.According to Rahul Pagidipati, CEO, ZebPay, Ether tends to follow Bitcoin."Now that Bitcoin has hit a record high and is consolidating, investors are adding Ether. Together the two cryptocurrencies constitute nearly 80 per cent of the total crypto market cap," Pagidipati said."Nearly 3 million ETH ($3.8 billion) have been locked up for long-term staking, removing them from the buyable supply. With lower supply comes higher prices," Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin said that Ether is touching record valuation because Bitcoin is consolidating and investors are looking at Ether to reap greater economic  benefits in the long term."Ethereum is up about 135 per cent since the start of the year and is expected to become as valuable as Bitcoin in the years to come," Thakral added."We hope Indian counterparts will take note of this and enable the growth of the digital asset industry in India by providing a positive regulatory environment. Ethereum Blockchain has very strong fundamentals and a lot of projects are using it to power their infrastructure."As India plans to introduce the 'Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021', to prohibit all "private cryptocurrencies" in the country, the industry stakeholders have come out in unison hoping that the Indian government would listen to all stakeholders before taking any decision."As  more people see new applications for the Ethereum protocol, like staking, they're realising that Either is real and has lasting value, just as they are realising the truth about Bitcoin," said Pagidipati.Owning one full bitcoin is probably a dream now for most people."But you can still buy a full Ether for Rs 1.6 lakh, still in reach for many. Those who remember Bitcoin at that price may be thinking that this opportunity won't last for much longer," the ZebPay CEO noted.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is already exploring the possibility as to whether there is a need for a digital version of fiat currency and in case there is, then how to operationalise it.The apparent softening in RBI's stand on cryptocurrency came after the Supreme Court last year set aside a circular issued by the RBI that barred any entity from providing  banking services to anyone dealing with virtual or cryptocurrencies.The RBI, in its booklet on payment systems, noted that central banks around the world are examining whether they could leverage on technology and issue fiat money in digital form.With the overall value of all cryptocurrencies surpassing the $1 trillion mark, industry experts have said that crypto may become the most important asset class of  the 21st century and India needs to catch up fast with the global trend. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-surging-ether-cryptocurrency-is-next-best-bet-after-bitcoin-209159
07-02-2021||Mumbai||Congress workers show black flags to Sitharaman on Mumbai visit||Congress workers showed black flags to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman here on Sunday to protest against the 2021-22 Union Budget and the increasing fuel prices.However, the police stopped the protesters from reaching near the venue of her visit here, a police official said.As the Union minister reached Yogi Sabha Grah in Dadar area for an interaction in the backdrop of the Union Budget presented by her last week, around 400 to 500 Congress workers started shouting slogans against her, the official said.They also raised slogans in praise of their party leader Rahul Gandhi.The protesters had started assembling outside the Dadar railway station since early morning, the official said.They shouted slogans against the Union Budget and the increasing prises of essential commodities like petrol, diesel, cooking gas cylinders as well as railway fares.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone 4) Vijay Patil said, “The protest took place peacefully. No untoward incident was reported. No one has been detained and no FIR has been registered.”Mumbai Mahila Congress general secretary (administration) Sana Qureshi claimed that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the general public and the poor people are facing job losses.“Now, the increasing prices of essential commodities will break the back of the common man. The budget has not offered any relief to the common man,” she said.Hence, the Congress workers staged a protest against the increasing prices of petrol, diesel and LPG, she added.Another party functionary said they are not happy with the Union Budget, hence they showed black flags to the Union finance minister. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-workers-show-black-flags-to-sitharaman-on-mumbai-visit-209149

I pray to Lord Ram to give peace to the souls who have passed away, strength to the aggrieved family members to bear the loss and speedy recovery to the injured."Later in a statement, Adityanath said in case of rise in the water level, people residing on the banks of river Ganga should be shifted elsewhere if needed.The chief minister also appealed to the people to not believe in any rumours nor spread them."People should exercise caution, and not venture towards the banks of rivers. In case of any adverse circumstances, co-operate with the district administration.

07-02-2021||New Delhi||TMC slams BJP over issue of allocation of funds for rail projects in West Bengal||The TMC on Sunday lashed out at the BJP over its assertion that it has allocated the highest-ever funds for railway works in West Bengal, and claimed the state has been deprived of funds for years and multiple rail projects shelved.The allocation of Rs 6,636 crore to poll-bound West Bengal is the highest-ever funds earmarked for the state in the history of Indian Railways, minister Piyush Goyal had said soon after the Union Budget was announced, blaming successive state governments for the delay in rail projects in the state.Taking to Twitter, TMC MP and national spokesperson Derek O’Brien said, “In election season, BJP’s tourist gang are touting ‘record Railway allocation’ for Bengal. The truth is, multiple rail projects have been shelved in Bengal and funding choked all these years.” Posting two documents, O’Brien has highlighted “How Bengal has been deprived of Railways funds for years.”   In the document, the Rajya Sabha MP has highlighted how over one dozen rail factories across Bengal, initiated by Mamata Banerjee when she was the Minister of Railways, have received only a token financial allocation this year.“The new rail coach manufacturing unit at Kanchrapara had been allocated Rs 74 lakh in the last budget. This year the allocation is just Rs 1,000. (One thousand rupees, not a typo!),” he said.He further said in Budget 2020 the Centre shelved 20 new connectivity ventures and 10 upgradation projects launched by Banerjee as Minister of Railways, especially in rural Bengal.“In Budget 2019 the Sealdah Coach Repair Factory - One thousand rupees Rail Museum in Bolpur - One thousand rupees! Coach Washing Workshop in Howrah - One thousand rupees!The list goes on,” he said.Accusing the BJP of only focussing on states in election year, he said that from 2016-17 to 2020-21, no new lines in Railways were announced in South-Eastern Railways, let alone Bengal.In 2020-21, four new projects were announced for SER but all of them went to Odisha and not Bengal. Banerjee had inaugurated the East-West metro corridor as the Rail Minister.“The BJP government has allocated funds very slowly for it since 2014. Kolkata Metro received an outlay of Rs 850 crore for 2019-20 which came down to Rs 750 crore in 2020-21. Come election year and this outlay is Rs 1330 crore”, he said.O’Brien also alleged that BJP states benefitted at the expense of the rest of India, citing two examples of the bullet train project and the broad gauge like in Surendranagar in Rajkot.He also highlighted how in Budget 2020-21, Rs 980 crore was sanctioned for the National Railway University in Gujarat.The Railway minister has said that there is no shortage of funds for the state and blamed the political dispensations for the delay in execution of works.West Bengal has 53 ongoing projects including new lines, gauge conversion, doubling projects costing Rs 48,275 crore for 4,463 km.“The allocation for West Bengal is the highest-ever in the history of Indian Railways. It is 2.5 times the average amount allocated between Budget 2009-2014 and 26 per cent more than last year,” he had said while addressing a press briefing recently. “Projects there remain incomplete or are delayed because the state governments—first it was the Left front government and now the TMC—have been unable to provide land to us. Projects which are 45 year old are pending in the state. I appeal to Mamata didi to expedite the process and give us land,” he had said.Goyal said that due to non-availability of land, as many as 34 projects in the state have received only token allotment in the budget 2021-22. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-slams-bjp-over-issue-of-allocation-of-funds-for-rail-projects-in-west-bengal-209134

07-02-2021||Mumbai||Court accepts closure report in murder bid case against Chhota Rajan||A special CBI court here has accepted the closure report filed by the probe agency against jailed gangster Chhota Rajan in a case of attempt to murder of a noted journalist in 1997.In his order issued on Saturday, special judge A T Wankhede cleared Rajan of all the charges due to lack of sufficient material to proceed against him in the case.On June 12, 1997, Mumbai-based crime reporter Baljeet Shersingh Parmar was severely injured after some motorcycle- borne shooters of Rajan allegedly attacked him outside a building in Antop Hill area here.Initially, the city police registered a case under charges for attempt to murder. Later, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) took over the case.The CBI recently filed its closure report on the ground that during further probe into the case, no additional evidence emerged against the accused.The judge in his order said, “On perusal of the available material, there is only reference in the FIR against him (Rajan) that previously one Dalbeer Singh received threats from Rajan. Except this, there is no material to connect the accused in this crime.”The court further noted that CBI’s investigating officer did not find any link to connect the accused (Rajan) with guilt and was unable to collect vital evidences pertaining to the case.The court said it made an attempt to call the informant - Baljeet Shersingh Parmar, but he was not traceable on the given address.Accordingly, the CBI submitted the unserved report, the court said.“Even otherwise, there is no sufficient material to proceed against the accused,” the court noted while accepting the closure report.Rajan, facing multiple criminal cases, is currently lodged at the Tihar Jail in New Delhi after his deportation from Indonesia in October 2015.He is an accused in around 70 cases in Maharashtra, including the case of murder of journalist J Dey in 2011.

07-02-2021||New Delhi||Major port trusts, AAI out of the scope of PSE strategic divestment policy||Certain classes of public sector entities, such as major port trusts, the Airport Authority of India, those undertaking security printing and minting, will not fall within the purview of the new PSE policy for strategic disinvestment.The new Public Sector Enterprise (PSE) policy for Aatmanirbhar Bharat, which classifies public sector commercial enterprises as strategic and non-strategic sector, would be limited to central public sector enterprises, public sector banks and public sector insurance companies.“The policy, however, does not apply to certain classes of public sector entities such as not-for-profit companies or CPSEs providing support to vulnerable groups or having developmental/promotional roles,” said the scope of the PSE policy announced in the Budget.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Budget unveiled the Disinvestment/Strategic Disinvestment Policy, which had four strategic sectors in which “bare minimum” number of CPSEs will be retained and the rest would be privatised or merged or made subsidiary of another CPSE or closed down.The four sectors are atomic energy, space and defence; transport and telecommunications; power, petroleum, coal and other minerals; and banking, insurance and financial services in non-strategic sectors; the CPSEs will be privatised, or will be considered for closure.The classes of public sector entities which would be out of the scope of the new PSE policy include public sector entities in the nature of development and regulatory authorities, autonomous organisations, development financing or refinancing institutions.Major port trusts and Airport Authority of India, set up under the Acts of Parliament, would not fall within its ambit.Further, CPSEs concerned with providing support to vulnerable groups through financing of the SCs, the STs, the minorities, the backward classes and the safai karmacharis; or manufacturing aids and appliances for Divyangs or those assisting farmers in mainly getting access to seeds, promoting innovation in agriculture, or procurement and distribution of food for the Public Distribution System would not be covered under the policy.The policy would not extend to the CPSEs involved in security printing and minting, or maintaining critical data having bearing on the national security.Also departments of the Government, such as the Railways and Ports, that undertake commercial operations with a development mandate would not be within the scope of the PSE policy.The PSE policy states that NITI Aayog will recommend the CPSEs under strategic sectors that are to be retained under government control or to be considered for privatisation or merger or putting under the control of another PSE or for closure.The alternative mechanism for strategic disinvestment, comprising Finance Minister, Road Transport Minister and Ministers of the Administrative Ministries will give final approval for the CPSEs to be retained, or privatised or merged or made subsidiary or closed down.The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, which manages government equity in public sector companies, will approach the Cabinet for strategic disinvestment of a specific PSE from time-to-time, on a case-to-case basis.The budget has set a target of Rs 1.75 lakh crore to be mopped up from disinvestment. Of this, Rs 1 lakh crore is estimated to come from sale of government stake in PSU banks and insurance companies and Rs 75,000 crore from the CPSE stake sale.

07-02-2021||New Delhi||Benefits on buying new vehicles on scrapping of old; taxes, other levies for polluting cars: Gadkari||Buyers of new vehicles after opting for the scrapping of their old and polluting vehicles will be offered benefits under the new policy to phase out old and polluting vehicles, Union minister Nitin Gadkari has said.Terming the policy a boon, the road transport minister said it would lead to a 30 per cent boost to the Indian automobile industry turnover to Rs 10 lakh crore in the years to come.The voluntary vehicle scrapping policy announced in the Union Budget for 2021-22 is touted as a major step to boost the Indian automobile sector, reeling under the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Under the voluntary vehicle scrapping policy, personal vehicles would undergo a fitness test after 20 years while commercial vehicles would require it after completion of 15 years.“Those going for the scrapping of their vehicles will get some benefits from the manufacturers. In fact, scrapping policy will prove to be a boon... not only it will boost the economy, benefit automobile sector but also check vehicular pollution,” Gadkari, who also holds MSME portfolio, told PTI.The minister said very soon the finer details of the policy will be unveiled by him and exuded confidence that the automobile industry will turn into one such sector that will offer the maximum number of employments in the days to come.Asked about disincentives for old and polluting vehicles not opting for scrapping since it will be voluntary, the minister said there are provisions of green taxes, other levies and such vehicles will have to undergo strict fitness tests in automated facilities.Secretary, Road Transport and Highways, Giridhar Aramane said incentives are worked out under the policy with discussions with stakeholders.Asserting that scrapping has huge advantages, he said research has pointed out that an old four-seater Sedan will result in losses of Rs 1.8 lakh in five years while for a heavy vehicle it comes to Rs 8 lakh for a period of three years.“We want to give some incentives,” he said and added that the policy is mandatory, all vehicles will be required for automated fitness tests done without any human intervention, corruption or fudging of data.He said automated fitness tests will be set up under PPP mode while for scrapping centres also private partners and state governments will be assisted.“Structure and framework of scrapping policy are under work and green tax has already been notified. Many states have notified in an ineffective way ....We want to advise the state governments through a notification under Motor Vehicles Act to consider imposing a green tax on older vehicles which cause more pollution,” Aramane said.Driving such vehicles that fail to pass automated tests will attract huge penalties and also be impounded.Talking about the policy, Gadkari said: “This policy will boost buying of new vehicles besides generating huge employment. Automobile industry turnover which is 4.5 lakh crore at present is likely to swell to Rs 10 lakh crore in years to come with India becoming an automobile hub,” the minister said.The export component of this which at present is 1.45 lakh crore will go up to Rs 3 lakh crore, he said and added that once the policy comes to practice availability of scrapped material like steel, plastic, rubber, aluminium etc will be used in the manufacturing of automobile parts which in turn will reduce their cost by 30 to 40 per cent.He said the policy will give a boost to new technologies with better mileage of vehicles besides promoting green fuel and electricity and cut on India’s huge Rs 10 lakh crore crude import bills.“One crore vehicles will go for scrap,” he said.Presenting the Budget for 2021-22 in Parliament, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 had said that details of the scheme will be separately shared by the ministry.Gadkari had said the policy will lead to new investments of around Rs 10,000 crore and create as many as 50,000 jobs.“The policy would cover an estimated 51 lakh Light Motor Vehicles (LMVs) that are above 20 years of age, while another 34 lakh LMVs are above 15 years. It would also cover 17 lakh medium and heavy motor vehicles, which are above 15 years, and currently without valid fitness certificates,” Gadkari said.These vehicles are estimated to cause 10-12 times more pollution than the latest vehicles, he said.Last month, the government had said it plans to impose a green tax on old polluting vehicles soon in a bid to protect the environment and curb pollution while vehicles like strong hybrids, electric vehicles and those running on alternate fuels like CNG, ethanol and LPG will be exempted. The revenue collected through the green tax will be utilised for tackling pollution.Under the scheme, transport vehicles older than eight years could be charged green tax at the time of renewal of fitness certificate at the rate of 10 to 25 per cent of road tax, as per green tax proposal sent to states for consultations after cleared by the ministry.Industry experts said the policy will provide a fillip to the Indian government’s efforts to position India as a global automobile manufacturing hub, as well as benefit global automakers with manufacturing industries in India, including Japanese giants Suzuki, Toyota, Nissan, amongst others.On July 26, 2019, the government proposed amendments to motor vehicle norms to allow scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years in a bid to spur adoption of electrical vehicles.In May 2016, the government had floated a draft Voluntary Vehicle Fleet Modernisation Programme (V-VMP) that proposed to take 28 million decade-old vehicles off the road. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/benefits-on-buying-new-vehicles-on-scrapping-of-old-taxes-other-levies-for-polluting-cars-gadkari-209113
07-02-2021||Uttar Pradesh||UP farmers demand withdrawal of FIR against widow, brother||Local farmers in Pilibhit district have demanded that the FIR lodged against the widow and brother of a protesting farmer, who had recently lost his life in Delhi, be immediately withdrawn.Three persons, including the deceased farmer’s wife and brother, were booked on Thursday for draping his body in Tricolour.Local farmer leaders and politicians have expressed their support to the demand for withdrawal of the FIR.Yogendra Yadav, who is the president of Swaraj India, said that he was not surprised with the police action.“There is a technicality of law and the spirit of the law. The technicality always needs to be reviewed in the context of the spirit. If the protesting farmers wish to honour their martyr by draping his body in a national flag, they only enhance the dignity of the national flag which shows their love for the Tricolour and their sense of pride. In such a situation any government should celebrate rather than come up with the technicality,” he said.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) district president Satvinder Singh Kahlon said the ‘Kisan panchayat’ will take up the ‘FIR issue’.“We will give a memorandum of our demand, addressed to the Prime Minister, and it will be handed over to the officials, he added.RLD’s state vice-president Manjit Singh Sandhu and a former minister Hemraj Verma of Samajwadi Party have also demanded the withdrawal of the FIR.Incidentally, another deceased farmer Navreet Singh’s body was also wrapped in the national flag.Singh had died when his tractor overturned in Delhi.When asked, Additional Director General of Bareilly zone Avinash Chandra said, “An FIR should have been lodged in Rampur too as the national flag code allows this privilege only in certain cases.”—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-farmers-demand-withdrawal-of-fir-against-widow-brother-209112

But, I have full faith in the judiciary, and I am hopeful of getting justice.”Arrested for allegedly hurting religious sentiments, Faruqui was in the jail since January 1.On Friday, the Supreme Court granted him interim bail after the Madhya Pradesh High Court rejected his bail plea on January 28.The apex court also stayed the production warrant issued against Faruqui by a court in Prayagraj in connection with an FIR lodged there.However, he was released late Saturday night only after a Chief Judicial Magistrate in Indore rang up the jail authorities and asked them to check the SC’s website for the bail order.Media persons had gathered outside the jail after getting the news of his release, but according to some eyewitnesses, Faruqui walked out of the jail quietly, to avoid a backlash in the wake of accusations made against him.Faruqui and four others were arrested on January 1 following a complaint by a BJP MLA’s son that objectionable remarks about Hindu deities and Union Home Minister Amit Shah were passed during a comedy show at a cafe in Indore on New Year’s Day. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/have-full-faith-in-judiciary-munawar-faruqui-after-release-from-jail-209100

His observations came despite two statements put out by the Ministry of External Affairs detailing the government’s stand. Sherman, who supported India on many issues, has opposed some decisions taken during Modi 2.0 such as the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). But in December last year, when the farmers were camping on the outskirts of Delhi, he had said the “farmers’ yearning to be heard is another powerful example of how peaceful protest is one the cherished democratic traditions binding the two countries together”.Once tipped to be the US Ambassador to India, Sherman has supported amendments to the US Arms Export Control Act to put India on par with key NATO allies and has opposed third party mediation in Kashmir, suggested by then US President Donald Trump.During his 2019 US visit, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had avoided meeting Pramila Jayapal but had met other Congressmen, including Sherman and Ami Bera. On December 3 last year, Sherman had done another favour by excluding India while co-introducing a resolution to “End enforced disappearances in Asia and globally”.Susan Sarandon tweets supportSusan Sarandon, Hollywood veteran who won the Best Actress Oscar, is the latest international celebrity to tweet in support of the Indian farmers.Won’t be silenced, says Meena HarrisMeena Harris, niece of Kamala Harris, has again tweeted support for the farmers. “Won’t be intimidated and silenced,” she said.Activists behind bars, Unions write to UNHRCFarmers’ unions have written to the UNHRC’s India head seeking intervention for the release of arrested activists.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/allow-peaceful-protests-net-access-india-caucus-208970

The Nadia police said permission was granted only for rally and not the rath yatra as a PIL was pending with the Calcutta High Court against it.Earlier in Malda, where he had meals with farmers, Nadda questioned Mamata for delaying the implementation of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme, saying, “The CM did so to satisfy her ego and later started the scheme only after she realised she was losing political capital.”The yatra which Nadda launched comes on the eve of PM Narendra Modi’s second visit to Bengal in 15 days.The PM was in Bengal on January 23 to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.“TMC’s Maa, Maati, Maanush vow has been reduced to dictatorship, tolabaazi (extortion) and appeasement of the minorities. The people have lost faith in the state government because only TMC leaders have benefitted in the Mamata regime. They even misappropriated the relief funds meant for the victims of Amphan cyclone,” Nadda alleged, asking why “Jai Shri Ram” slogans repulsed the CM.“Why does she hate Jai Shri Ram so much? Is it wrong to be in touch with one’s culture? The TMC wants to forsake Indian culture for vote banks,” Nadda said rejecting Mamata’s charge that the BJP was an outsider to Bengal.PM to launch projects in West Bengal today||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jp-nadda-flags-off-parivartan-yatra-sans-police-nod-slams-mamata-banerjee-208979

That has not happened in India.“We cannot rule out the resurgence of Covid-19 as long as there is a susceptible population. The national sero-survey conducted in December-January to determine the prevalence of Covid antibodies found 21.4 per cent people had been exposed to the virus, while 79 per cent remained vulnerable.Brazil saw Covid resurgence at sero-prevalence of 75 per cent.

This is going to be our slogan for the movement”“If the government is understanding this, then talk to farmers. Make a law on the MSP, take back the three laws, only then will farmers return to their homes,” said Tikait, who is camping with his supporters on a stretch of the Delhi-Meerut highway since late November.Interacting with the press, he claimed a few inputs had been received regarding some miscreants “trying to disrupt peace” during the “chakka jam” that was announced for 12 pm to 3 pm on Saturday.“Because of these inputs, we had decided to call off the ‘chakka jam’ in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand,” the 51-year-old Tikait, credited with reviving the farmers’ stir, said.He also urged farmers to ensure support to the movement. Neither let the numbers go down at the protest sites, nor overcrowd these, he said.“Don’t be in any illusion. Neither the platforms nor the leaders of the protest will change. They will sow iron nails, we will sow crops,” he added.“Hum hi kisan hain, hum hi jawan hain (We are the farmers and we are the soldiers). This is going to be our slogan for the movement,” he said.Tikait urged farmers joining the protest at Delhi borders to bring a fistful of soil from their farmland and take back a similar amount of “mitti” of the revolution from the protest sites.“Go and spread this revolutionary soil in your farms and traders will never look at your farmlands (to usurp it),” Tikait said.Read also: Farmers block roads in Punjab, Haryana as part of ‘chakka jam’Arrogance of power has gone to your head, RSS leader tells Union Agriculture Minister Tomar“This movement will continue for a year. It’s an open offer and proposal to the government. A law on MSP will have to be made, without that we won’t go back home. Three laws will be taken back. Both these demands have to be met and there will not be any compromise on that. There cannot be a bigger movement. We cannot quit the protest, nor are we leaving the government,” he said.“If the laws are not made now, then it won’t happen ever. Farmers of the country have been looted at half rates. MSP prices are given in Punjab and Haryana but not across the country. This (protest) is for the whole country. They will try to divide us, saying it’s a movement of one state. But that it is not. It’s a pan-India movement,” he added.The BKU leader appealed to farmers not to get involved in contract farming.“Your land will provide you employment. Do not be misguided that businessmen will provide you jobs. They will usurp you land. They will take your land for contract farming at hiked rates but do not lease it to them. Don’t give your land,” he said.Tikait said protests will be held at police stations in the areas where notices are being served on people who participated in the stir. “Those joining farmers protest are getting police notices. But those who joined violence in Ayodhya were not sent any notice. How many people were there? Who take guarantee for that and why was the mob not stopped there,” he said.Amid a stringent security set up installed around the Ghazipur protest site, the farmer leader, flanked by his supporters, also interacted with Delhi Police officials.“Nobody can touch the farmlands, the farmers will protect it. Both farmers and soldiers should come forward for it,” Tikait said.Interacting with security personnel who were on the other side of the barricading, he said, bowing his head and folded hands, “My pranaam (a respectful salutation) to you all. Now you all will protect my farms.”Besides Ghazipur, thousands of farmers are encamping at Tikri and Singhu border points of Delhi since November with a demand that the Centre repeal the three contentious agri-marketing laws, saying these would hurt their livelihood. However, the Centre, which has held 11 rounds of formal talks with the protesting groups, has maintained that the laws are pro-farmer.

07-02-2021||Bhopal||Arrogance of power has gone to your head, RSS leader tells Union Agriculture Minister Tomar||In an apparent attack on Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar over the farmers' protest, senior RSS leader Raghunandan Sharma has said the arrogance of power had gone to his head.Sharma, a former BJP Rajya Sabha member from Madhya Pradesh, in his Facebook post written two days back, also suggested to the minister that he should work towards strengthening nationalism.In his social media post that starts with the line, "Narendraji, you are part and parcel of the government,” Sharma said, "Your intention might be of helping the farmers, but if some people don't want to be helped, what is the use of doing such good?""If someone wants to remain naked, what is the use of forcibly clothing him," he said."If you are harbouring a thought that you are reaping the fruits of your hard labour, it is your illusion," the 73- year-old RSS leader said in the post."...Today arrogance of power has gone to your head. Why are you losing the mandate? We are endorsing all rotten policies of the Congress which is not in our interest. Leakage in drops of water from a pitcher empties it. So is with the mandate," he said."Employ all might to strengthen nationalism or else we have to regret. I think you might have read the indication to preserve the ideology," he added.Sharma described how the (RSS's) ideology was developed with toil, sacrifice and devotion over a century for expanding its footprints, propagating service to the motherland, putting nationalism first and leading to the installation of a nationalist government at the Centre."Thousands of nationalists have devoted their lives for today's nationalist government," he said.
