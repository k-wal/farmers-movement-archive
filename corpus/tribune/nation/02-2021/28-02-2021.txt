28-02-2021||Villupuram/Karaikkal||Amit Shah praises Tamil language and culture in TN, Puducherry||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday spoke high of Tamil and its culture, calling it ‘sweet’, on a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed regret about not being able to learn the old southern language.Addressing his party’s ‘Vijay Sankalp’ rallies in Villupuram in Tamil Nadu and Karaikkal, an enclave of neighbouring Puducherry, ahead of the April 6 Assembly elections, Shah apologised to the crowd that he could not deliver his address in Tamil, although it “would have been nice” if he could do so.“First of all I want to say sorry that I am unable to talk in one of the oldest languages in the country, the sweet one,” Shah said at the Villupuram public meeting.“Without the great Tamil culture, India’s culture is incomplete,” he added.Tamil Nadu had given “great people” who have done the country proud globally, Shah said, adding “the country respects Tamil and its culture”.He also referred to Modi’s statement on Sunday about the language.Shah’s harping on Tamil came on a day when Modi, in his monthly ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme expressed regret over not being able to learn the “world’s oldest language”.     “A few days ago Aparna Reddy ji of Hyderabad asked me one such question. She said ‘You have been PM for so many years and were CM for so many years. Do you ever feel that something is missing?” Modi said.Noting that the question seemed simple but was difficult, he said, “I pondered this over and told myself that one of my shortcomings was that I could not make much effort to learn Tamil, the oldest language in the world; I could not make myself learn Tamil!”The prime minister, who had invoked Tamil poet Kanian Poongundanar in his UN General Assembly address in 2019, besides reciting from Tamil treatise Tirukkural during his recent public engagements in Tamil Nadu, also praised the Tamil language and its rich literature.“It is such a beautiful language, which is popular all over the world. Many people have told me a lot about the quality of Tamil literature and the depth of the poems written in it,” he said.Shah, in his Karaikkal public meeting regretted that he could not address the crowd in the “great Tamil language”.     He also hit out at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his recent support to jallikattu, which he witnessed in Madurai in January and said the party’s election manifesto for the 2016 assembly polls batted for a ban against the bull taming sport.Jallikattu, the famous event held in Madurai during the harvest festival Pongal in January, has an emotional connect with the Tamil people and a major agitation was held in 2017 at the Marina here seeking revoking of an earlier ban against the conduct of the event. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-shah-praises-tamil-language-and-culture-in-tn-puducherry-218713
28-02-2021||New Delhi||State, districts required to pre-register COVID-19 Vaccination Centres on Co-WIN2.0||States and districts will be required to pre-register COVID-19 Vaccination Centres (CVCs) on the Co-WIN2.0 portal before the registration is opened for people above 60 years and those aged 45 and above with co-morbidities so that the list of CVCs is available to the citizens, the Union Health Ministry said.The registration begins from March 1 at 9 am. The eligible beneficiaries can choose the centre of their choice and book an appointment based on the slots available.Read also: Population-based Covid vaccination from Monday, registrations open from 9 amAccording to a guidance note on Co-WIN2.0 issued by the Health Ministry, states and UTs will decide the target number of doses to be administered in a vaccination cycle, based on already available vaccine doses and additional doses likely to be available in a vaccination cycle.As far as vaccination slots are concerned, these can be further classified as mobilisation slots and open slots.Mobilisation slots are those for which respective states and UT government shall mobilise beneficiaries for on-site registration, appointment, verification and vaccination (all on-site on the same day).There will not be any need for pre-registering beneficiaries through online interface for this. Proportion of such slots will be decided by respective state and UT government.Open slots will be open for online appointments by general citizens. The number of Open Slots for a session will be worked out by subtracting the number of reserved slots from the CVC session capacity, the guidance document said.“It is recommended that, to begin with, one particular COVID-19 Vaccination Centre (CVC) may be either fully reserved or their full capacity is opened for online self-appointment, to avoid the confusion and problems in physical queue management on site at the CVC,” the document stated.If it is so decided that a CVC will have both the reserved and the open slots, session timings for open slots may be carefully selected to avoid overlap of beneficiaries between the ones coming through online appointment and the ones being mobilised for mobilisation slots, it said.The timings for on-site registrations in such a case should also be carefully publicised. Since, when a beneficiary is being vaccinated with first dose, COWIN will automatically confirm the appointment of the beneficiary for the 2nd dose at the same vaccination centre, the target number of doses should be decided with careful consideration of available stocks and requirement of vaccine stocks for 2nd dose vaccinations for the already partly vaccinated beneficiaries.

28-02-2021||Puducherry||Puducherry Assembly Speaker quits on health grounds||Puducherry Assembly Speaker VP Sivakolundhu quit on Sunday citing health reasons even as his brother joined the BJP just over a month ahead of the elections in the Union territory.In the resignation letter to Lt Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, a copy of which was made available to mediapersons here, Sivakolundhu, a Congress leader, said he quit as Speaker only on health grounds.Later, he told PTI that he handed over the letter of resignation addressed to the Lt Governor to the Assembly Secretary.Sivakolundhu won from the Lawspet constituency in the 2016 Assembly elections on a Congress ticket.Meanwhile, Sivakolundhu’s brother VP Ramalingam joined the BJP in Karaikal in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who is on a campaign visit.Also, former DMK legislator K Venkatesan and former Congress legislator A John Kumar who had quit their MLA posts on February 21 joined the BJP in Karaikal in the presence of Shah who was in Karaikal to address a public meeting.The Puducherry government headed by V Narayanasamy fell on February 22 after the coalition ministry was reduced to a minority following a spate of resignation of Congress MLAs and a DMK legislator.President’s rule has since been imposed in the Union territory while assembly polls are slated for April 6. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/puducherry-assembly-speaker-quits-on-health-grounds-218710

We found positivity rate in government labs to be 7.8 per cent while it is between 18-20 per cent in these three private facilities,” an official said.One of the labs that has been pulled up later said in a press release that it has issued a “Rs 500 crore defamation notice” to the district collector “in his official and personal capacity”, as well as the state chief secretary and health secretary.“We have preserved all swab samples collected since January 2021 and requested the administration to get them rechecked by the NIV.

28-02-2021||Muzaffarnagar (UP)||Farmers’ protest in Muzaffarnagar villages more about sugarcane issues than agri laws||The old saying that “agriculture is the best way to earn a living and working for someone else is the worst” has given way to new realities, says Raj Kumar, a farmer from Satheri village in this western Uttar Pradesh district, a region where farmers’ agitation seems to be driven more by the “stagnant” sugarcane prices and the stray cattle menace, than by the three contentious agri laws.Kumar, a Rawa Rajput, says sugarcane prices have not been raised for the past several seasons, whereas companies have reduced the size of Urea and DAP bags, making manure costlier and agriculture “unsustainable”.“Pehle kehte the, Uttam Kheti—Beech Vyapar—Neech Naukri. Ab to sab ult gaya hai, (We used to say agriculture is the best way to earn a livelihood, followed by trade or business and the worst was to be working for someone else. This wisdom seems to have crumbled),” says Kumar.Muzaffarnagar, a western Uttar Pradesh district, is not very far from Delhi which has seen its three border points turn into tent cities as farmers protesting against the three new Central agricultural laws, which open up the sector for private players, have been camping there for close to three months now. But on the question of farm laws, Kumar says he doesn’t know much about them but he has been supporting the protesting farmers as agriculture has become “unsustainable”.Echoing similar sentiments, Roshan Lal, a Saini by caste and a small-scale farmer, said more than the three farm laws, it is delay in payment for sugarcane and the rising diesel prices, along with the problem of stray cattle that have made their lives miserable.“More than farm laws, no hike in cane prices, delay of over a year in payments of sugarcane and the menace of stray cattle have broken our back,” Lal said, standing by Kumar. “All this has forced us to raise their voices for farmers’ issues.”Sohan, a Kashyap (Jhimir) by caste from Ganshampura village who owns less than 1 acre land and uses his crop mostly in his jaggery workshop, says until and unless sugarcane prices are increased the prices of jaggery would also remain stagnant.“Yahan to inkh hi sab kuchh hai…uska dam badhega toh gud ka daam bhi badhega warna toh mazdoori bhi bachna mushkil hai (Here sugarcane is everything. If its prices increase, the prices of jaggery will also go up otherwise it would be difficult to pay even wages),” he said.Sohan said he has heard about farm laws but doesn’t know much about them. He also flagged the issue of stray cattle.All three—Ram Kumar, Roshan and Sohan—underlined the importance of sugarcane prices and timely payments to farmers and expressed limited reservations about farm laws which is based on the information shared by farmer leaders.The opposition to these laws becomes louder and more visible as one moves towards the Jats-dominated areas in the western Uttar Pradesh.In the Shoram village, which is seen as the headquarters of Khaps (caste councils) of Jat community, a mere mention of farm laws evokes strong response.“These laws are not only against the farmers but against the country...those who are guarding the borders are our sons and behind their back you are trying to snatch the rights of their brothers who are into farming,” said Bhupender Choudhary, a villager.Choudhary, a middle-aged farmer, said the sentiment against the farm laws became more pronounced after people in the region saw Bhartiya Kisan Union Leader (BKU) Rakesh Tikait crying on TV channels.Tikait, himself a Jat, hails from Sisoli village in Muzaffarnagar district.The protest will continue till the government takes back farm laws, says Vipin Balyan, a 35-year-old farmer from the Shoram village. “The proponents of these black laws will pay heavily in coming elections.”Both Bhupender and Vipin also expressed concern about the “stagnant” sugarcane prices, delay in payments to sugarcane farmers and the havoc caused by stray cattle, saying that all these are damaging farmers economically.However, most of the farmers whom the PTI spoke to in the region said they are receiving annual Rs 6,000 government assistance under the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi Scheme started by the Centre.The entire western Uttar Pradesh has been witnessing a number of Mahapanchayts organised either by khaps or farmer leaders or political parties against the farm laws.The sugarcane crop, the mainstay of the farmers in the region, is cultivated on more than 80 per cent of the arable land in the districts of western Uttar Pradesh.As per the data provided by All India Sugar Traders Association (AISTA), the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of Sugarcane was at Rs 255 per quintal for 2017-18 season and increased to Rs 285 per quintal in 2020-21 season.Whereas the Uttar Pradesh government’s State Advisory Price (SAP) is fixed at Rs 315 per quintal for the last four seasons from 2017-18.There are nearly 50 sugar mills in the region besides a large number of jaggery workshops. Several sugar mills have not cleared farmers’ dues of last season, according to farmers.Agriculture experts say a farmer cultivates on an average 900 quintal of sugarcane in one hectare of land in one season which is of about nine months.The farmer spends on an average around more than Rs 2 lakh per hectare including all its expenses during a season on sugarcane crop.

In an incident that has come to light, a young woman from Hyderabad was duped by a perspective groom by making her believe that he was sending her gold and jewellery for Rs 1 crore to have a grand engagement ceremony.According to the city police, a woman expressed her desire to settle overseas on a web portal and sought alliances for matrimony. She was approached by a person posing to be a doctor in Canada, both exchanged their numbers and started chatting.The fraudster claimed to be residing in Canada and said he has been working as a doctor.Some months later the prospective groom expressed the desire of having a grand engagement and told the bride to be that he was sending gold and jewellery worth Rs 1 crore and said it was a wedding gift from him.The woman received a call where the caller said, “We are calling from Delhi airport. You have got gold and jewellery worth Rs 1 crore, but according to the rules, we can’t hand over the parcel to you unless you pay a tax of Rs 10.69 lakh. If you pay the total amount, you can take the parcel with you.”Taken in by the set-up, the girl paid the entire amount as was asked. Later when she tried to contact the same number, it was unreachable. She even tried to call the person with whom she has been talking to the “doctor in Canada”, but that number remained switched off. Finally, she filed a complaint with the Cyber Crime.After days of investigations the police cracked the case after the arrest of a Bareli (Uttar Pradesh) resident Mohammad Haseen and the entire scam came to light. “This is just another innovative ways to dupe unsuspecting people,” a police official said advising people not to have any financial dealing with people they meet online.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hyderabad-woman-duped-by-a-man-she-met-online-218697

28-02-2021||Kolkata||Mamata to join hands with BJP again in case of hung assembly in Bengal: Yechury||CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Sunday said the Trinamool Congress has to be defeated first to stop the communal bandwagon of the RSS-BJP, and claimed that the TMC might rejoin the NDA to form the government in West Bengal in case of a hung assembly.Terming the ongoing political tussle between the TMC and the BJP as a “mock fight”, Yechury alleged that the saffron party is using money from the PM CARES fund, set up to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, to “buy” leaders during the time of elections.“The farmers at the Singhu border in Delhi are fighting against the (Narendra) Modi government’s anti-people policies. If farmers who provide us with food can put up such a gallant fight, we too can do it here,” he said.“This grand alliance of the Left and the secular forces will fight to defeat the corrupt TMC government and the BJP in the state, will fight for a better Bengal,” Yechury said while addressing a joint rally at the Brigade Parade Ground in Kolkata ahead of the assembly election in West Bengal.The CPI(M) leader alleged that the Mamata Banerjee administration is doing the same to youths what the Narendra Modi government is doing against the farmers.“Many people ask me what we would do in case of a hung assembly. I tell them to direct their question to the TMC as they are in the best position to answer it.“The TMC has been part of NDA (for several years) since 1998. It was part of the NDA government (at the Centre).In case of a hung assembly, I am confident that the TMC would join hands with the BJP to form the state’s government,” he said.“All the secular forces have to fight together to defeat the TMC and the BJP in Bengal. Once we stop this communal juggernaut in Bengal, we will stop it in the country also,” Yechury said.He claimed that the BJP and the TMC are using religion to divert attention from the problems being faced by the people of the country and the state.Criticising the BJP for attacking several other political parties, especially the Congress, over the issue of dynasty politics, Yechury wondered how Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s son became the secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).“The BJP talks about corruption and dynasty politics.A stadium is named after Narendra Modi. Amit Shah’s son is an office-bearer in the cricket association,” he said.“In the name of the corona, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set up a fund (PM CARES Fund), and that money is being used to buy and sell leaders during elections,” he said.A number of leaders from various parties, mainly the ruling TMC, have joined the saffron camp ahead of the West Bengal assembly election.The CPI(M) general secretary asserted that West Bengal is headed for a triangular fight in the coming assembly polls as the Left-Congress electoral alliance is a formidable contender against the TMC and the BJP.Elections to the West Bengal assembly will be held in eight phases. The first and last phase of polling will be held on March 27 and April 29 respectively. Votes will be counted on May 2.

28-02-2021||Chandigarh||For first time in India, study on qualitative requirements for dogs in forces||For the first time in India, qualitative requirements-cum-trial directives have been formulated on a selection of canines for breeding of dogs in the security forces.A scientific K9 study, has been completed and submitted to the K9 Cell of the Ministry of Home Affairs by a Central Armed Police Forces board, with the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) as the lead agency.The board standardised the actual physical parameters, temperament, behavioural characteristics, and phenotypic gene expression of selected working-line breeds of dogs. According to sources, this is a very long pioneering study on Malinois, German Shepherds, Labradors, Dobermans, Cocker Spaniels, Springer Spaniels, Hounds, Golden Retrievers, Dutch Malinois, and many more breeds, was carried out the ITBP.The work was complimented by the MHA K9 consultant, Dr PK Chug, during the National K9 Seminar organised at the Bureau of Police Research and Development this week.This study— for the very first time—draws out the exact parameters on selection of dog breeds, not on basis of ‘show line’ that has been the practice in India, but on actual working traits and their suitability of induction in the forces. During a briefing to the union home minister, Amit Shah— during the release of the National K9 Journal recently—the formulation of qualitative requirements and trial directives for dogs was declared to the one of the important goals of the ministry.ITBP has been felicitated for its technical expertise and perseverance in putting in efforts in coming out with this unique original document, that will raise the standards of working line K9s not only in CAPFs but also in the Army and state police forces. Sources said that such a comprehensive study of international standards has never been attempted before and this is for the first time that an Indian force has concluded a pivotal study that has been accepted by the MHA. This will act as a key scientific document to upgrade the cutting-edge of K9 wings of all security forces of the country and will herald the mainstreaming of K9 activities by bringing all organisations on the same grid, a senior officer said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/for-first-time-in-india-study-on-qualitative-requirements-for-dogs-in-forces-218672
28-02-2021||New Delhi||CBI identifies 10 more victims of child sexual abuse by junior engineer, records their statement||The CBI has identified 10 more victims of alleged child sexual abuse by now-suspended Uttar Pradesh Irrigation department junior engineer Ram Bhuwan, the alleged paedophile also accused of selling the illicit acts with kids on the dark web, officials said.Further expanding its exhaustive probe, the central probe agency recorded the statement of these 10 male victims to buttress its charges against Bhuwan who was arrested along with his wife and a suspected accomplice, they said.                 The person arrested from the national capital, whose identity is being kept secret by the CBI, is understood to be an important link in unravelling the mystery of the 50-year old junior engineer using the dark web to sell child sexual abuse material and making money from it, they said.     The agency team has so far identified around 35 victims and is in the process of identifying others, they said.     The CBI is also working on deciphering digital evidence from recoveries made during searches at the premises of Bhuwan and his suspected accomplice, they said.            The agency had recently filed its charge sheet before a special court in Banda in which the CBI had presented statements of about 25 victims, all males between the age of 4-22 years, and the reports of digital evidence collected during searches at the residence of Bhuwan.The JE was arrested on November 16, 2020, while his wife was taken into custody on December 28, 2020.They were arrested by a newly established special CBI unit, which is handling online child sexual abuse, after it started tracking and apprehending paedophiles operating on the internet and busted his alleged activities after trailing him for days, they said.The accused, a resident of Chitrakoot district in Uttar Pradesh, was arrested from Banda by the Special Unit of the CBI specialising in ‘Online Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation Prevention/Investigation (OCSAE).Both are in judicial custody.The agency has charged Bhuwan and his wife under IPC sections related to criminal conspiracy (120-B) and homosexuality (377) along with provisions of The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Information Technology Act.The Supreme Court had struck down Section 377 of the IPC but legal advice received by the CBI suggested that since the crime period spans before the law was quashed, the provisions can be invoked.The 50-year-old Ram Bhuwan stands accused of allegedly abusing around 50 children in the age group of 4-16 years in three adjoining districts of Uttar Pradesh—Hamirpur, Banda, Chitrakoot—for over a decade and selling those recorded sexually explicit acts on the dark web.“The accused allegedly used electronic items and gadgets to lure children falling in the age group of 5-16 years. The scrutiny of the emails of the accused had revealed that he was allegedly in constant touch with several individuals (both Indian and foreign nationals) for the purpose of sharing child sexual abuse material,” CBI Spokesperson RC Joshi said.He said the accused had allegedly created and shared a huge quantity of child sexually abusive material, over the years, through the internet using various social media platforms and websites over the darknet etc. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-identifies-10-more-victims-of-child-sexual-abuse-by-junior-engineer-records-their-statement-218670
28-02-2021||New Delhi||My dream is to see India and Pakistan become ‘true good friends’, says Malala Yousafzai||The old philosophy of having borders and divisions doesn’t work anymore and the people in India and Pakistan want to live in peace, Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai said on Sunday, stressing that it is her dream to see the two countries become “good friends”.She also said that minorities need protection in every country, be it Pakistan or India, adding that the issue is not related to religion but to the “exploitation of power” and must be taken seriously.Yousafzai, a Pakistani activist for girls education who miraculously survived a bullet to the head from the militant Taliban in October 2012, said the news of internet shutdown and arrests of activists “protesting peacefully” in India is “worrying” and expressed the hope that the government will make sure that people are heard.“It is my dream to see India and Pakistan become true good friends and that we can visit each other’s countries. You can continue to watch Pakistani dramas, we can continue to watch Bollywood movies and enjoy cricket matches,” said the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner.She was speaking on her book “I Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and was Shot by the Taliban” on the concluding day of the Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF) which is being held in the virtual mode.“You are Indian and I am Pakistani and we are completely fine, then why is this hatred created between us? This old philosophy of borders, divisions and divide and conquer... they just don’t work anymore, as humans we all want to live in peace,” she said.The actual enemy of India and Pakistan is “poverty, discrimination and inequality” and both countries should unite and fight them, not each other, she added.Apart from “India-Pakistan friendship”, Yousufzai said she also dreams of the day when every girl would get to go to school and have access to quality education.The 23-year-old activist also raised her voice for minorities across the world and said they are at “risk” and need to be protected globally by governments and human rights organisations.“Minorities are at risk. Minorities’ rights are not given to them. Be it Hindus and Christians in Pakistan, Muslims, Dalits and other minorities in India ... Palestinians, Rohingya refugees. It is not religion, it is the exploitation of power, it is just elites vs the poor and minorities.“Minorities need protection globally from every country. They need a voice, need protection, and it is a reminder to governments, to human rights organisations to take this very seriously,” she noted.During the discussion, she also applauded Indian girls and young women fighting for human rights, “speaking out” for farmers in India, climate change and protection of the minority rights, and called their work “empowering and inspiring”.However, the news of the internet shutdown and arrests of activists protesting peacefully in India is “worrying”, she claimed.“.. You may not like their political opinion but it does not mean that you put them in jails and arrest them. It is a democratic right of every individual—including women and girls—to highlight their political opinions... So I hope that the government makes sure that people can protest peacefully and ask for their rights, and that they are heard,” she added.The 14th edition of JLF featured over 300 speakers and performers representing around 25 Indian and 18 international languages and over 23 nationalities.Some of the big names who made it to the festival this year included American linguist Noam Chomsky, 2020 Booker Prize winner Douglas Stuart, Nobel Laureates Joseph Stiglitz, Microsoft Corporation co-founder Bill Gates, and actor-author Priyanka Chopra. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/my-dream-is-to-see-india-and-pakistan-become-true-good-friends-says-malala-yousafzai-218669

28-02-2021||Noida||Over 7.35 lakh senior citizens registered with UP Police’s emergency 112 service||Over 7.35 lakh senior citizens across Uttar Pradesh have so far registered themselves with the state police’s ‘Savera’ initiative for “enhanced response” when the emergency 112 number is called, officials said.Additional Director General (ADG) of Police (112 service) Asim Arun said the initiative was launched in 2019 with an objective to prepare a database of senior citizens in the state.“At times senior citizens call 112 during emergency situations but are unable to describe their problem or inform their location. In case of cities having multi-storey and high-rise apartments, the PRV (police response vehicle) may track the call location, but then there are hundreds of flats and difficult to find the callers location,” Arun told PTI at the 112 headquarters in Lucknow.“So, for an enhanced response during such situations involving senior citizens, the Savera initiative was launched and 112 now has over 7.35 lakh senior citizens registered on it,” he said.The database, he said, includes information like the name of a senior citizen, their home and work address, contacts of spouse, family or local acquaintances.“There is also an option for them to share their basic medical history so that in case it is a medical emergency, the 112 responders would already have adequate knowledge about the caller. But this information sharing is voluntary,” the senior IPS officer said.Arun cited a number of cases, like incidents of domestic violence, in which the emergency police responders have prevented serious mishaps, fights, and even suicide attempts because of this initiative.According to 112 officials, such an enhanced response to distress calls creates a sense of security among the citizens.Any senior citizen living in Uttar Pradesh can get their primary registration in ‘Savera’ done by calling 112, the officials said.After primary registration, the local police station or beat officer goes to the residence of the senior citizen and gets the detailed registration done in which essential details like health, family (if provided by the senior citizen) are sought, they added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-7-35-lakh-senior-citizens-registered-with-up-polices-emergency-112-service-218655

The duration of Kumbh is being shortened to prevent spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.The devotees may carry their test reports, fitness certificate and e-passes on their mobile phones or in hard copies for verification as and when required, Prakash said.All state governments have been requested to widely publicise the SOP so that there is no confusion about it among the devotees, he said.The state health department has been asked to ensure that healthcare personnel and other frontline workers to be deployed on Kumbh duty are administered the COVID vaccine doses on priority, the official said.Officials have also been asked to promote COVID appropriate behaviour like maintaining a distance of 6 feet between two persons in public places, wearing of masks and frequent hand sanitisation, the chief secretary said.International travellers coming for Kumbh will also have to observe the SOP besides following the travel advisory available on the website of MoHFW for international arrivals.Any violation of the SOP will attract penal action against the defaulters, he said.The SOP is to be adhered to at all facilities in the Kumbh Mela area including parking lots, ghats, railway stations, bus stands, hotels, guest houses, ashrams and dharmashalas during the entire duration of the event, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kumbh-mela-penal-action-to-be-taken-against-violators-of-covid-19-sops-218652

28-02-2021||Islamabad||Pakistan may resume import of cotton from India: Report||Pakistan may allow cotton import from India through the land route as prospects of the gradual restoration of bilateral trade ties have brightened after the new ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control, according to a media report on Sunday.Citing sources in the Ministry of Commerce, The Express Tribune reported that Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce Abdul Razak Dawood may decide on whether to import cotton and yarn from India next week.They said that the issue of the cotton shortfall has already been brought to the notice of Prime Minister Imran Khan, who also holds the portfolio of the commerce minister. Once a principled decision is taken, formal order will be presented before the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet, the sources told the daily.The sources said that in-house deliberations have already begun but the final decision would be taken only after seeking the approval of the prime minister.“I cannot say yes or no at this stage and would be in a better position to respond on Monday,” Dawood told the daily, responding to a question on whether Pakistan was considering allowing cotton import from India.The trade ties between both the countries can help minimise the cost of production in Pakistan and ensure sustained food supplies, the daily said. India and Pakistan issued a joint statement on Thursday to strictly observe all agreements on a ceasefire along the LoC and other sectors after the hotline discussions by their Director Generals of Military Operations.The two countries signed a ceasefire agreement in 2003, but it has hardly been followed in letter and spirit over the past several years.Relations between the two neighbours have nose-dived after a series of terror attacks in India perpetrated by terror groups based in Pakistan.Bilateral ties deteriorated further after India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019. The move angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad. Pakistan also snapped all air and land links with India and suspended trade and railway services. The paper reported that against the annual estimated consumption of a minimum of 12 million bales, the Ministry of National Food Security and Research expects only 7.7 million bales production this year. However, cotton ginners have given the lowest production estimates of only 5.5 million bales for this year.There is a minimum shortfall of six million bales and Pakistan has so far imported roughly 688,305 metric tonnes of cotton and yarn, costing USD 1.1 billion, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. There is still a gap of about 3.5 million bales that needs to be filled through imports.Due to the shortage of cotton and yarn, the users were compelled to import them from the United States, Brazil and Uzbekistan.Imports from India would be far cheaper and would reach Pakistan within three to four days.Importing yarn from other countries was not only expensive but would also take one to two months to reach Pakistan, the daily reported, quoting businessmen who deal in these commodities.The delay in yarn import can pose risk to the timely deliver of the export orders, according to the paper.However, the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) is exerting pressure on the Pakistan government not to allow cotton and yarn import from India.An industry insider told the daily that few millers have already hoarded the cotton and were now charging higher rates and import would dampen their short-term earnings.In an appeal to Dawood, Aptma said that the import of yarn from India will directly impact cotton prices in Pakistan.“The cotton sowing season is currently starting in Pakistan and the predicted drop in cotton price owing to import of yarn from India is approximately 10-15 per cent, discouraging farmers not to sow cotton,” according to the Aptma.  On Thursday, India said it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan and is committed to resolving all issues bilaterally in a peaceful manner.Prime Minister Khan on Saturday welcomed the ceasefire agreement with India and said Islamabad remains ready to move forward to resolve “all outstanding issues” through dialogue. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-may-resume-import-of-cotton-from-india-report-218650

28-02-2021||Tuticorin||‘Disparity’ in wealth distribution stronger in BJP rule, says Rahul Gandhi||Disparity in wealth distribution has become much stronger during the BJP rule at the Centre, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi claimed on Sunday.On the second day of his tour of southern Tamil Nadu for poll campaign, the top Congress leader interacted with salt pan workers and said he emphasised with them when they narrated their travails, including health issues.When a woman worker sought government financial support for four months in a year, as during this period they would not have work in salt pans, he said the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance had an idea to tackle such an issue.“When we were in government in the UPA we noticed that the wealth distribution in India was becoming very skewed,” he said replying to the worker. While a few people were getting “very very rich,” many were poor, he said.“And now since the BJP has come (to power at the Centre) that has become much much stronger,” he alleged.The idea the party had to handle the problem of protecting the interests of workers for the period they did not have work was the “concept of a minimum income,” the Nyay scheme for every single poor family in the country, he said.Irrespective of factors like from which state they hailed or their language or religion, beneficiaries would automatically get Rs 72,000 a year in their bank accounts till such time they were out of poverty, he said.When the Congress gets voted to power at the Centre, the Nyay plan would be implemented to address their concern of getting income for the non-working period, he said.Women workers flagged the issue of rampant alcohol addiction among the menfolk who spend their hard-earned money on consuming liquor leaving their families in the lurch. They urged Gandhi to work for implementing complete prohibition.Some others sought plots to build houses by utilising unused sites owned by the Centre’s salt department in the region.Better wages, a welfare board, pension and improved living conditions were among the other demands workmen made.When Gandhi posed questions on health issues they faced due to years of hard work in salt pans, they pointed out that they had to endure eye-related ailments and wounds in the feet that often led to difficulty in walking.Gandhi said he empathised with them, adding he learnt quite a lot by having a dialogue with them. Also, he requested the workers to explain to him the process of salt making during his next visit. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disparity-in-wealth-distribution-stronger-in-bjp-rule-says-rahul-gandhi-218644

28-02-2021||New Delhi||CBSE to hold training sessions for schools on restructured affiliation process||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is planning a series of webinars and training sessions for schools to familiarise them about the newly restructured affiliation process, according to officials.“CBSE has restructured the affiliation process under different categories of applications i.e. fresh affiliation, upgradation, extension of affiliation etc. To familiarise the schools with the new process and to resolve the queries of the schools, the Board will organise introductory webinars and training session from March 9 to 13,” said CBSE Secretary Anurag Tripathi.“The registration process for the webinar shall commence from March 1 to March 8, 2021 on CBSE website. Interested schools can register themselves accordingly. The application for affiliation will be accepted tentatively from March 16,” he added.Restructuring the affiliation system as per various recommendations for systemic reforms laid down in the new National Education Policy (NEP), the board is making the process completely digital and based on data analytics with the least human intervention.“The restructuring will help in establishing ease of doing business in the CBSE affiliation system, attaining the goal of minimum government, maximum governance, automated and data driven decisions, achieve transparency, bring more accountability in the entire systemic processes and achieve quick and time-bound disposal of all applications,” Tripathi said.“A detailed document on CBSE school affiliation system containing the re-structured online procedure for affiliation, required documents, modalities and Standard Operating Procedures for inspections, guidelines for inspection committee and videos for various processes will also be uploaded on CBSE website tentatively by Monday for perusal by schools. Schools may familiarise themselves with the manual prior to attending the online sessions,” he added.The CBSE had introduced a facility for virtual inspection of schools for upgradation of affiliation in August last year in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.The board is also in the process of setting up a facilitation centre to address queries, and problems of schools and inspection committees related to the virtual inspection.The board had revamped its norms in 2018 for granting affiliation to schools, leaving the onus of the infrastructural audit on states and limiting its own role to academic quality monitoring.The CBSE has 24,930 schools affiliated to it across the country and abroad, with over 2 crore students and more than 10 lakh teachers.

28-02-2021||New Delhi||1 crore more free LPG connections in 2 years: Oil Secretary||The free LPG connection scheme is one structural reform of the Modi government that has been internationally acclaimed for ridding indoor household pollution and improving women’s health.And now, the government plans to give one crore more free LPG connections to the needy over the next two years and make it easier to access cooking gas to achieve near 100 per cent penetration of the clean fuel in the country.Oil Secretary Tarun Kapoor said plans are in the works to provide LPG connection with bare-minimum identity documents and without insisting on residence proof of the place of availing the cooking gas.Also, consumers would soon get a choice of getting a refill cylinder from three dealers in his or her neighbourhood instead of being tied to just one distributor, who may not be able to provide LPG on demand due to availability or other reasons.In an interview with PTI, Kapoor said a record-breaking 8 crore free LPG connections were provided to poor women households in just four years alongside the aggressive rollout of cooking gas, taking the number of LPG users in the country to about 29 crore.The Union Budget earlier this month announced a plan to give out one crore more free cooking gas connections under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala (PMUY) scheme.“Our plan is to complete these additional one crore connections in two years,” he said.While no separate allocation for this has been made in the Budget for 2021-22, the general fuel subsidy allocation should be enough to cover the expense of about Rs 1,600 per connection, he said.“We have done a preliminary estimate of the people who are now left out. The number comes to 1 crore,” he said. “After the successful Ujjwala scheme, households without LPG are very less in India. We have around 29 crore households with LPG connections. With the one crore connections, we will be close to 100 per cent LPG penetration.”     He, however, hastened to add that one crore unserved population was a dynamic number and there may be more families that may need LPG connections as they move to cities or other places for employment and other reasons.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s signature Ujjwala scheme for providing a free cooking gas connection to the poor had been lauded by the WHO in 2018 and by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in the following year as one that reduced indoor household pollution by helping families switch to cleaner energy sources and improving the environment and health of women.The carbon footprint of LPG is 50 per cent lower than coal. LPG helps reduce carbon dioxide and black carbon emissions, which are the second-largest contributors to global warming.Before Ujjwala, India was the second-largest contributor to global mortality due to household and ambient air pollution.“We want to connect everyone in the country to the LPG network,” Kapoor said. “Besides Ujjwala, we are also easing out the procedure for getting LPG connections.”      While theoretically, the current rule is that everyone is eligible to get a cooking gas connection, practically it is difficult to get one due to requirements such as proof of residence of the place, where the connection is being sought.“We have asked our oil companies that those kinds of complaints should be eliminated. A person who is even shifting from one city to another, even temporarily, should also be able to get an LPG connection without hassles. We want to move to a stage where with very basic documents, just some proof of identity, one can get an LPG connection,” he said.As a step towards that, a unified software for all the three fuel marketing companies - Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum - is being prepared.“We are getting a common information technology-based system in place. Right now, the three companies have their separate IT-based systems. We also want to popularise the mobile applications that our companies have so that no one has to keep a physical booklet,” he said.Through this software, inter-company migration will become very easy, he said, adding in cities a person would have a choice of seeking an LPG refill from three distributors of the same company.The Ujjwala Yojana was launched in May 2016 with a target to give free LPG connections to 5 crore mostly rural women members of below the poverty line (BPL) households. The list was later expanded to include all SC/ST households and forest dwellers, among others.In 2018, the scheme was extended to all poor households and the target raised to 8 crore connections.Under the scheme, the government provides a subsidy of Rs 1,600 to state-owned fuel retailers for every free LPG gas connection that they give to poor households. This subsidy is intended to cover the security fee for the cylinder and the fitting charges.The beneficiary has to buy her own cooking stove. To reduce the burden, the scheme allows beneficiaries to pay for the stove and the first refill in monthly instalments. However, the cost of all subsequent refills has to be borne by the beneficiary household.

28-02-2021||New Delhi||65 pc low, lower-middle income countries slashed education budgets after COVID-19 outbreak: Report||Education budgets were cut by 65 per cent of low and lower-middle-income countries after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic while only 33 per cent of high and upper-middle-income countries did so, according to a report by the World Bank.The report, compiled in collaboration with UNESCO's Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report, said the current levels of government spending in low and lower-middle-income countries fall short of those required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."In order to understand the short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education budgets, information was collected for a sample of 29 countries across all regions. The sample represents about 54 per cent of the world's school and university-aged population. The information collected was then verified with World Bank country teams," the report said."Responding to the COVID-19 crisis requires additional spending to adapt schools for compliance with the necessary measures to control contagion and to fund programs to make up for the losses in learning students experienced while schools were closed," it added.The sample includes three low-income countries (Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Uganda); 14 lower-middle income countries (Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Kenya, Kyrgyz Republic, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Tanzania, Ukraine, Uzbekistan); 10 upper-middle income nations (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Jordan, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Peru, Russia, Turkey); and two high-income countries (Chile, Panama)."The following countries have education shares below 10 per cent and therefore are likely to have other main financing sources besides budget assigned by the central government: Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, India, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Russia," the report stated."It is not clear that countries that have seen a decline in their education budget will be able to cover these costs increased during the pandemic alongside the regular increases in funding needed to support growing school-age populations."Despite the urgent need for adequate funding to allow school systems to reopen safely, about half of the countries in the sample cut their education budgets. This scarcely bodes well for the future, when macroeconomic conditions are expected to worsen," it said.On the other hand, households in low and lower-middle income countries tend to contribute a greater share of the total education spending than those in upper-middle and high-income countries, the report pointed out."While data is limited, household education spending as a share of GDP has increased in low-income countries and households still contribute significantly to the costs of education. The pandemic has resulted in a large and negative income and health shock for many households," it said.So far, COVID-19 has infected over 11.43 crore people across the globe and claimed over 25.37 lakh lives. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/65-pc-low-lower-middle-income-countries-slashed-education-budgets-after-covid-19-outbreak-report-218631

However, the situation was soon brought under control, police said.Clashes werealso reported between members of two political partiesat Singvad and Jhalod talukas of Dahod district.There were also a few instances of villagers boycotting voting.In some villages in the tribal-dominated districts of Panchmahal and Chhota Udepur, people decided to stay away from the electoral process to mark their protest against “lack of development” in their region.A technical snag was reported in an EVM at a polling booth in Bhavnagar.Voting began at 7 am and ended at 6 pm.Several ministers in the BJP government, including Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel and Members of Parliament (MPs) voted across different booths in Gujarat.Patel cast his vote at his native Kadi municipality of Mehsana district along with his family members.Union Minister of State for Panchayati Raj and Agriculture Parshottam Rupala and BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Jugalji Thakor were among the leaders who cast their votes in the early hours.Congress leader Hardik Patel also voted at a booth at Viramgam in Ahmedabad district.As per the SEC, there are a total of 8,474 seats across 81 municipalities, 31 district panchayats and 231 taluka panchayats in Gujarat, out of which candidates on 237 seats remain unopposed, and no form was filled for two seats in taluka panchayat.Thus, elections were held on a total 8,235 seats, it said.For 8,235 seats, the BJP had fielded 8,161 candidates, Congress 7,778, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) 2,090, among others, said the SEC.Apart from the traditional rivals- BJP and Congress-, AAP and Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM were also in the fray for local body polls in Gujarat this time.By-elections were also held for two seats in taluka panchayats and 24 seats in municipalities.Votes for the polls will be counted on March 2.In the February 21 elections, the BJP won with a majority across all the six municipal corporations.There are a total 3.04 crore registered voters in the second phase election.Over 44,000 policemen, including State Reserve Police and 12 companies of CAPF, along with 54,000 homeguards have been deployed to ensure incident-free voting.

28-02-2021||London||New book uncovers Indian mystery probed by Sherlock Holmes author||Arthur Conan Doyle, the British creator of the world-famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, was drawn to investigate just one real-life crime during his lifetime and it involved a British Indian man wrongly accused of a series of mysterious crimes in an English village in the early 20th century.The story of that Indian-origin barrister, George Edalji, has now been dug up in detail and brought to life in a new book by London-based historian-author Shrabani Basu, who chanced upon the mystery and pursued it through archival records and letters over the years.The result is ‘The Mystery of the Parsee Lawyer: Arthur Conan Doyle, George Edalji and the case of the foreigner in the English village’, which is released in the UK next week and in India on March 10.“I think Indian readers will find it interesting that in 1907 Arthur Conan Doyle responded to a letter by a young Indian lawyer appealing to him for help to clear his name, and he took up the cause,” said Basu, the author of previous historical accounts such as ‘Spy Princess: The Life of Noor Inayat Khan’ and ‘Victoria and Abdul: The Extraordinary True Story of the Queen’s Closest Confidant’.“Even Jawaharlal Nehru, who was an 18-year-old student at the time in Harrow School in London, got fascinated with the case and remarked that George had no doubt been targeted because he was Indian,” she said.The story, which revolves around several threatening letters and the distressing killing and mutilation of animals, was one of the most famous cases of miscarriage of justice in Edwardian England which was forgotten over time.Conan Doyle, whom George Edalji had turned to for help after being jailed for crimes he did not commit, encountered a mystery worthy of his fictional detective. The Sherlock Holmes author meticulously pieced clues together to conclude that George had been the victim of racism for being a “Hindoo” – as all Indians were referred to at the time.“What fascinated me was the fact that the only true crime that Arthur Conan Doyle investigated personally was to do with an Indian. To me, it was a story that was calling out to be told. Like most people, I am a fan of the Sherlock Holmes books and love a mystery,” said Basu.While the intriguing incident took place over 100 years ago, the scenario has resonance even in modern-day Britain.“The more I read the letters and the press coverage at the time, the more it felt that this could be happening now. Mistrust of immigrants, the fear of the foreigner, have been issues in Western society for a while now.The whole Brexit debate focussed on immigrants from eastern Europe entering the country and taking local jobs. Anonymous letters continue today, in the form of hate mail and online trolling,” reflects Basu. George Edalji was born to an Indian Parsi father who converted to Christianity, Shapurji Edalji, and an English mother. Shapurji went on to become the first Indian-origin vicar to have a parish in England, in the village of Great Wyrley in Staffordshire. The mixed-race family, an uncommon feature for its time, were at the receiving end of a lot of harassment and the wrongful conviction of George affected them all deeply.Today, on the face of it, there is nothing in the village that would serve as a reminder of its troubling past. The fields have been built upon and the mines are no longer there. But Shapurji’s old vicarage and church remain.“Local history societies in the area are still very aware of the case, which put the village in the spotlight at the beginning of the 20thcentury,” said Basu, who retraced the family’s steps to the village in the West Midlands region of England in the course of her research.Now, as the forgotten tale has been pieced together into a comprehensive account and is ready to hit the shelves, Basu hopes that this “real-life Sherlock Holmes mystery that involves an Indian” will appeal to mystery lovers worldwide.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-book-uncovers-indian-mystery-probed-by-sherlock-holmes-author-218608
28-02-2021||New Delhi||IT Dept detects Rs 220 crore black income after raids on Tamil Nadu-based tiles manufacturer||The Income Tax Department has detected undisclosed income of about Rs 220 crore after it raided a leading tiles and sanitaryware manufacturer based in Chennai, the CBDT said.The action was carried out on February 26 and a total of 20 premises in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Kolkata were searched and surveyed, it said.The CBDT said in a statement that Rs 8.30 crore cash was seized during the raids on the group engaged in the business of manufacture and sale of tiles and sanitaryware. The group is the “leader” in the tiles business in south India.“In the course of search, unaccounted sale and purchase of tiles were detected. Details of unaccounted transactions were unearthed in the secret office and the software maintained in the cloud,” it claimed.It was found that the transactions to the extent of 50 per cent were out of books, the statement claimed.         “Considering the previous turnover, the suppression of income may be in the range of Rs 120 crore. This is in addition to Rs 100 crore of undisclosed income introduced by the group as share premium through shell companies,” it claimed.“Total undisclosed income detected so far comes to Rs 220 crore,” the CBDT alleged.The statement issued late Saturday night said the searches were on.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), which frames policy for the tax department, meanwhile, said it was fully prepared to check and monitor the role of money in influencing voters.The department remains committed to tracking the generation of unaccounted cash and its movement in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, it said.Assembly polls to TN and Puducherry will be held in a single phase on April 6. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/it-dept-detects-rs-220-crore-black-income-after-raids-on-tamil%C2%A0nadu-based-tiles%C2%A0manufacturer-218605
28-02-2021||United Nations||Israel, Palestine must avoid unilateral action that could prejudice final status issues: India at UN||Reiterating that only a two-state solution will deliver enduring peace that the people of Israel and Palestine deserve, India has said this should be achieved through direct negotiations between both sides on final status issues and any unilateral action which could prejudice these issues must be avoided.India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador K Nagaraj Naidu said on Friday at the UN Security Council meeting on ‘The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question’ that New Delhi reaffirms its support to the Palestinian cause and the establishment of a sovereign, viable and independent State of Palestine living side by side in peace and security with Israel.“We firmly believe that only a two-state solution will deliver enduring peace that the people of Israel and Palestine desire and deserve. This should be achieved through direct negotiations between both sides on final status issues. Both sides must avoid any unilateral action which could prejudice these final status issues,” he said.Naidu termed the recent diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled peace talks as encouraging and added that the meeting of the Quartet’s Special Envoys is timely. India urged the Quartet to initiate engagement with the Israeli and the Palestinian leadership.“India welcomes all efforts, which are aimed at strengthening the collective commitment of the international community to resume direct negotiations and facilitate the peace process,” Naidu said.Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and Personal Representative of the Secretary-General Tor Wennesland told the Council meeting that the global community is focused on helping the parties return to the negotiating table.Earlier this month, the League of Arab States reiterated its support for the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian State based on the 1967 lines, with East Jerusalem as its capital. The Envoys of the Middle East Quartet – Russia, United States, European Union and United Nations - met virtually on February 15 to discuss the political developments, with all agreeing to meet on a regular basis.Naidu also added that India is pleased to note that preparations for the Palestinian elections are moving forward. The Cairo agreement between the Palestinian parties on the conduct of parliamentary and presidential elections - to abide by the electoral timetable, accept the results of the election and on other election related arrangements - is a positive step in the right direction, he said.Noting that the commitment undertaken by all parties to release political detainees will also help build trust between them, India acknowledged Egypt’s efforts in facilitating this agreement. The high percentage of Palestinians, who have registered to vote in the elections, reflects their desire to take part in the democratic process, he said.Wennesland said the holding of free and fair elections in the Palestinian Territory will help “clear the path” for restoring a legitimate political horizon to realise a long sought two-State solution.The elections will provide a crucial step towards re-establishing Palestinian national unity – and renewing the legitimacy of national institutions, including a democratically elected Legislative Council and Government in Palestine, he said.Naidu added that the opening of Rafah border crossing is a significant development, which will ease the humanitarian and health situation in Gaza.India stressed that the pandemic’s impact on the people of Gaza has been particularly severe due to the fragile health-care infrastructure.Noting that COVID-19 vaccines are being made available to the people of Palestine, including in Gaza, Naidu said India strongly believes that “equity in access” to vaccines across the world is important for mitigating the impact of the pandemic.India has provided critical medicines and medical equipment to Palestine as COVID-19 assistance and is now in the process of sending a second batch of medicines as a grant to the Palestinian people in the coming weeks.“We will also facilitate an early supply of vaccines to Palestine,” Naidu said.On COVID vaccination prospects, Wennesland welcomed the announcement of the Palestinian vaccination strategy and the initial allocation to the Palestinian Ministry of Health of 37,440 doses of vaccines by the COVAX-AMC facility.

Bengal does not want Pishi. It wants its daughters and every woman of the state is the face of Bengal,” Chatterjee said today as the war of words between the BJP and TMC intensified.TMC’s poll strategist Prashant Kishor also weighed in on the issue tweeting, “One of the key battles for democracy in India will be fought in West Bengal and the people of Bengal are ready with their message and determined to show the right card — Bangla Nijer Meyekei Chay (Bengal only wants its own daughter Mamata).”“On May 2, hold me to my last tweet,” Kishor dared the BJP which continued to unleash top guns on the campaign scene keen to improve its previous tally of 27 MLAs as against TMC’s 209 in a 294-member Assembly.With women’s empowerment emerging as a prominent election theme, the TMC took a dig at the BJP today saying it treated women unequally.The reference was to the RSS which doesn’t enroll women in core ranks.Minister Smriti Irani, however, hit back saying, “We are led by a Prime Minister who ensured 33 per cent reservation for women in the party organisation. We do not need certificates on women’s empowerment from anyone.”BPF to be part of ‘Grand Alliance’ in AssamGuwahati: The Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), a part of the BJP-led Assam government, on Saturday said it would join the ‘Grand Alliance’ helmed by the Congress to contest the poll. “To work for peace, unity and development, the BPF has decided to join hands with the ‘Mahajath’,” its chief Hagrama Mohilary said.

Since 1991, reforms were incremental but the recent months have been a departure with the consolidation of labour laws, new farm sector laws and a clear-cut framework on privatisation. This showed palpable conviction and boldness from the government which is unprecedented.”Birla was having a virtual fireside chat with veteran diplomat Gautam Bambawale on the second day of the virtual Asia Economic Dialogue helmed by the MEA and Pune International Centre. Enthused by the economic headwind, his $50 billion Aditya Birla Group was investing $ 2.8 billion (Rs 280 cr) in capital expenditure and there were suggestions that other parts of the industry will also do so. “We are now moving very quickly from resilience to renewal. I see a lot of buoyancy & business optimism. I think we are coming out of the pandemic definitely looking stronger,” he added.In an earlier session on the WTO involving subject specialists, Permanent Representative of Jamaica at the WTO Cheryl Spencer said developing countries were disproportionately affected. “The WTO’s agenda must be open to the issues of such countries and the processes need to be fair and flexible. For this, a transparent and balanced dialogue is necessary,” Spencer said.PR of the EU at WTO João Aguiar Machado felt the trade policy could play a role in boosting economy and agreed with Spencer that the world had to address the damage in granular and targeted ways. Continuation of differential treatment for developing countries at the WTO was also sought by South African PR at the WTO Xolelwa Mlumbi-Peter who cautioned WTO’s future depended on its response to the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/economic-plumbing-by-govt-has-enthused-industry-kumar-mangalam-birla-218325

Instead, “Tumpa Sona”, a recent raunchy number released on a web platform, has been turned into a parody by the CPM to draw crowd for the rally jointly organised by the CPM-led Left Front, Congress and Indian Secular Front at Kolkata’s Brigade Ground on Sunday.Justifying the song, Shubha Prasad Nandi Majumdar, cultural activist of the CPM, said turning a popular song into a parody and then singing it at Communist Party events had taken place in Bengal in the past too. “The use of ‘Tumpa Sona’ by the CPM for drawing crowd for the rally shows how desperate they are to impress voters,” Saptarshi Biswas, award winning Bengali poet, said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/raunchy-song-at-cpm-rally-raises-eyebrows-218349

The Congress reacted gently, describing the dissenters as family respectables and asking, “If they care so much about the party, why don’t they canvass in poll-bound states?”Ghulam Nabi Azad at Jammu functionRetired from RS, not from politics: AzadWe will continue our fight for restoration of statehood. Every party in Jammu, from the BJP to RSS, National Conference to PDP and Panthers Party, wants statehood back.Led by Congress veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad, six rebels, sporting saffron turbans, appeared together at an event in Jammu. Former law and HRD Minister Kapil Sibal led the offensive against his own party, saying it was time to speak the truth.“Why are we assembled here? The truth is we can all see the Congress is weakening. We had assembled earlier too because we believe together we have to strengthen the Congress,” said Sibal in the presence of former minister Anand Sharma, former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Punjab MP Manish Tewari, Raj Babbar and Vivek Tankha, all members of a group of 23 leaders who wrote to party chief Sonia Gandhi in August 2020 to initiate a comprehensive party overhaul. The event, organised by Gandhi Global Family, was meant to facilitate Azad, who recently retired as Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha after his term ended. Azad said he had retired from Parliament but not from public service. Sibal however said: “No one wanted Ghulam nabi Azad to leave Parliament. I cannot fathom why the party is not using the experience of a person like Ghulam Nabi Azad?” Sibal asked, inviting a rebuttal from the Congress which listed the several party posts Azad had held in his 40-year political career.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said, “We are proud and so is Mr Azad that he has held the Congress flag aloft for more than seven terms in Parliament, five in the Rajya Sabha and two in the Lok Sabha. We are both proud that Congress president Sonia Gandhi nominated Mr Azad as CM of J&K where he had a successful tenure. Mr Azad has been a respected Union Minister for over three decades and over the same period he has been AICC general secretary exercising supervision over more than 20 states.” The Congress also said the best contribution to the Congress cause would be “to get active in the various campaigns ongoing every day in the five states where the Congress is fighting elections.”Anand Sharma said: “I have not given anyone the right to tell me if we are Congress men or not. We will build the party and strengthen it.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/party-weakening-well-strengthen-it-congress-rebels-218382

The people with any of the listed conditions would need to get a proforma signed by doctors as a certificate of eligibility, which would have to be produced at the time of registration for vaccination.The details were shared with the states at a virtual meeting chaired by Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan, who said more than 1.5 core vaccinations of health and frontline workers had been done in phase-1 that began on January 16.“The states have been explained that the private hospitals functioning as Covid vaccination centres can charge beneficiaries subject to a ceiling of Rs 250 per person per dose. User names and passwords will be provided to private facilities for effective use of CoWin-2,” the Health Ministry said.To expand vaccination capacities, the states can use as vaccination centres around 10,000 private hospitals empanelled under Ayushman Bharat Prime Minister Jan Aarogya Yojana, over 600 hospitals empanelled under the Central Government Health Scheme and other hospitals empanelled under state health insurance schemes. The government has shared a list of empanelled private hospitals with states.

28-02-2021||New Delhi||Leaders should display their loyalty to party by campaigning in poll-bound states: Cong||The Congress on Saturday said the leaders in the “Group of 23” are respectable partymen in whom it took pride, but advised them to make their “best contribution” and display their “loyalty” to the party by campaigning to strengthen it in the states that are going to polls.The advice came in response to the remarks made by some members of the “Group of 23”, who got together to address a non-political rally in Jammu and said the Congress has “weakened”.The “Group of 23”, led by senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, had written to party chief Sonia Gandhi demanding an organisational overhaul and internal elections for all posts in the Congress.Read also: Congress weakening, ‘G-23’ has come together to strengthen it: Dissenters at Jammu meet“With greatest respect on behalf of the Congress party, each person who has gone to Jammu to address a rally is a senior, highly-respected and well-regarded member of our party, we are proud to have them in our party and I believe that they are equally proud to be members of the Congress. They are, therefore, part of the Congress family,” party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi told reporters here.He, however, said it would have been better if the said leaders, including Azad, campaigned to strengthen the Congress in the poll-bound states.“Gently and respectfully, I say that the best contribution to the Congress’s cause would be to get active, not in any manner among ourselves, but by participating in the ongoing campaign everyday in the five states that are going to polls,” Singhvi said.He said the “true loyalty” of the leaders to the Congress would have been displayed had they campaigned in favour of the grand old party and strengthened it in the poll-bound states, where it is fighting hard.To a question on the remark made by one of the leaders in Jammu that Azad was “used” by the Congress, Singhvi said the veteran leader has never complained in this regard, adding that those making such remarks are probably not aware of the party’s contemporary as well as old history.He said Azad has been a Union minister since the times of former prime minister Indira Gandhi and has represented the Congress seven times in Parliament, including five terms in the Rajya Sabha, for a long innings spanning over 40 years.Besides, he said Azad was made the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir by Congress president Sonia Gandhi and also the general secretary of the party for 20-25 years, exercising supervision on the Congress’s rank and file in over 20 states.Singhvi refused to answer further questions on the issue of internal discipline as the Congress leaders have gone public with their criticism of the party for the first time.In a public show of dissent, the “G-23” leaders, including Azad, Anand Sharma and Kapil Sibal, who have been pressing for a change of leadership and an organisational overhaul in the Congress, gathered on one stage in Jammu, saying the party is weakening and they have come together to strengthen it.“It is an occasion to speak the truth and I will speak the truth. Why have we gathered here? The truth is we can see that the Congress is weakening. We have gathered here. We had gathered earlier also and together, we have to strengthen the Congress,” Sibal said, addressing an event dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi that was also attended by several other party leaders such as Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Manish Tewari and Raj Babbar.The leaders, who were part of the group now called “G-23”, had triggered a storm in the party last year with their letter to the Congress chief, expressing unhappiness over its functioning and demanding a full-time party president.
