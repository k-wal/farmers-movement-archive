The announcement of privatisation of public sector banks and an insurance company is also worrying.  Instead of doing strategic investment of these undertakings, it would be better if efforts are made to improve the performance of these enterprises, and after that only their equity is disinvested in the market,” said Mahajan."The strategic disinvestment of the enterprises created by tax payers’ money is not right. Sale through equity route would be a far better and transparent option, after improving their performance," he added.Mahajan also called raising the FDI limit in the insurance sector from 49 per cent at present to 74 per cent "worrisome”.“Increasing foreign dominance in the financial sector is not a prudent step. This increases foreign dominance over the financial resources of the country and impacts the development of the country," he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/swadeshi-jagaran-manch-expresses-major-concern-over-disinvestment-of-psus-asks-government-to-reconsider-decision-206458

The one-time relaxation will benefit over 3,300 students without even increasing the age-limit, it said.The Bench had on Friday asked the Centre to explain why a one-time relaxation can’t be given to civil services aspirants who could not appear in their last attempt in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.“It’s just a one-time relaxation and if it has been done before then why not this time?” it had asked Additional Solicitor General SV Raju.  It had also asked the Centre not to issue any notification for 2021 UPSC examination till February 1.The Centre has opposed the idea, saying allowing an extra attempt to civil services aspirants who could not appear in their last chance in the 2020 examination due to the COVID-19 situation would create a “cascading effect”, detrimental to the overall functioning and level playing field necessary for a public examination system.The Centre said such a decision in favour of the petitioners would seriously prejudice other candidates. Giving an additional attempt or relaxation in age for some candidates would amount to extending differential treatment to similarly placed aspirants at the examination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/extra-chance-to-civil-services-aspirants-sc-defers-hearing-to-friday-206454

01-02-2021||New Delhi||SC seeks WhatsApp response on plea seeking non-sharing of UPI data||The Supreme Court on Monday asked WhatsApp to file its response on a plea seeking a direction to the NPCI and the RBI to ensure that data collected on Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platforms is not shared with their parent company or any other third party under any circumstances.Senior advocate Krishna Venugopal, appearing for petitioner, Rajya Sabha member Binoy Viswam, submitted before a bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde that in the previous hearing, the court had asked the company if Israeli sypware Pegasus has breached their systems.Venugopal cited that it was wrongly stated this issue was not pleaded in the petition and added that till date, Facebook and WhatsApp have not filed a counter-affidavit in the matter.He said that his client's petition has been pending for months, and the top court should ask Facebook and WhatsApp to file a counter-affidavit.The bench, also comprising Justices A.S. Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, noted that if WhatsApp does not file the reply, then the averment made by the petitioner will be taken as accepted.Several interlocutory applications have been filed in the plea. These applications seek direction to frame regulation to ensure that data collected on UPI platforms is not exploited.Senior advocate Arvind Datar, representing WhatsApp India, contended before the court that no formal notice has been issued to it in the plea for impalement in the matter.Senior advocate V. Giri, representing the RBI, submitted that the Central bank has already filed its reply in the matter. Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, also appearing for WhatsApp, submitted that his client has received all necessary permissions.The top court observed that the plea should be tagged with similar plea pending and asked the Centre to file an affidavit in the issue connected with spyware. Concluding the hearing in the matter, the bench told WhatsApp counsel that pleas challenging its new privacy policy are pending before the court.The bench has scheduled the matter for further hearing after four weeks.The Reserve Bank of India has told the Supreme Court that the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) allowed WhatsApp to "go live" on UPI only after ensuring it was fully compliant with its circular.The central bank also stressed the onus is on the NPCI to respond on the status of compliance of WhatsApp, Google and Amazon with the system rules/procedural guidelines governing the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).In an affidavit, seeking dismissal of Viswam's plea, the RBI said: "NPCI is the system provider of UPI and, therefore, comes under the regulatory radar of the RBI. Since it was NPCI that allowed Amazon, Google and WhatsApp to operate under UPI, the responsibility to ensure that these entities comply with all the rules/regulations/ guidelines governing UPI lies with the NPCI." Viswam, in the plea, sought protection of data of transactions made over UPI.He contended that the RBI and the NPCI instead of fulfilling their statutory obligations are compromising the interest of Indian users by allowing the non-compliant foreign entities to operate its payment services in India. The plea seeks response from the RBI and the NPCI to ensure that the data of Indian citizens collected on UPI platforms was not misused by WhatsApp, Google and Amazon.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-whatsapp-response-on-plea-seeking-non-sharing-of-upi-data-206452

The ship is carrying Australian coal.This is the second Indian ship to suffer such a fate.Earlier, another ship ‘Jag Anand’ with 23 Indian sailors, after a six-month-long wait to unload its Australian coal cargo, had to travel to a Japanese port to change the stranded crew following refusal by Chinese officials citing COVID-19 protocols.Asked how long China would take to permit the ship to unload the cargo and complaints of the crew members not getting medical aid in time, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing that Chinese officials were in close touch with the Indian side by “replying timely to the Indian side's requests" and providing practical suggestions of a crew change.“We have been providing necessary convenience and assistance to the Indian side in accordance with our COVID-19 protocols,” he said but gave no indication when the ship would be permitted to unload the cargo.It is not clear why China is delaying permission for the ships to unload cargo. In December last year, Wang denied that there was any link between the situation of Indian crew on two stranded ships at Chinese ports and its strained relations with India and Australia.Relations between Australia and China in the past few months nose-dived after Canberra barred Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies from its national 5G network over national security concerns.China also resented Canberra's push for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus in April. Reports from Australia say China has been restricting a number of Australian exports, including coal.Meanwhile, 'Jag Anand' which changed its crew at a Japanese port reportedly returned to join the queue to unload its cargo at Jingtang port.The shipping company reportedly spent over USD one million to arrange crew change through Japan.

Therefore, it will be done gradually,” a BCI release stated.However, Vikas Singh -- who has been protesting to demand immediate resumption of physical hearing – said, “I on behalf of the members of the Bar insisted on full physical hearing as before and that too immediately. The CJI did not agree and hence we have decided to continue our protest till our demand is met.”He said hybrid mode could have been an option if implemented today but agreeing to Hybrid without restoration of normal functioning was not acceptable.Mishra said, “The secretary general (of the apex court) was asked by Justice Bobde to get the technical problems solved at the earliest so that courts could resume its functioning physically from the first week of March 2021.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-readies-for-hybrid-mode-of-hearing-206448

This would come into effect from April 1.Addressing a post-Budget press conference, the minister said up to Rs 2.5 lakh has been kept as the deposit limit for which interest is tax exempt.“We are not reducing any workers right. But at the same time, getting tax exemption and 8 per cent rate of interest for somebody who puts Rs 1 crore into the account, we thought is may be not correct. And therefore we have put the ceiling,” she said.It is only the big-ticket money which comes into the fund and gets tax benefit as well as assured about 8 per cent returns that would come under the tax ambit.“You have huge amounts, some to the extent of Rs 1 crore, being put into this account each month. For somebody who puts Rs 1 crore each month into this fund, what would be his salary? So for him to get tax concession and 8 per cent return we thought is probably not comparable with an employee with Rs 2 lakh who puts that money, gets tax concession and gets 8 per cent return. That person would still be allowed to put in money, but of course with a ceiling of Rs 2.5 lakh,” she said.Somanathan said the Budget proposal affects “those who are not workers by any stretch of imagination but are using this, they are entitled to do. But they are a very, very small fraction of total number of contributors.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/interest-on-employees-pf-contributions-over-rs-2-5-lakh-to-be-taxed-206426

Around 217 projects under the NIP – worth Rs 1.10 lakh crore under some key infrastructure ministries – have been completed already, the Minister informed.Two more initiatives announced by Sitharaman with a view to achieve the target set by the NIP are setting up of institutional structures for debt financing and monetising assets.Regarding creation of institutional structure for debt financing, Sitharaman proposed setting up a professionally managed Development Financial Institution (DFI) “to act as a provider, enabler and catalyst for infrastructure financing”.The DFI will start with an initial corpus of Rs 20,000 crore provided by the government. The ambition is to have a lending portfolio of at least Rs 5 lakh crore for the DFI in three years.Sitharaman said monetising operating public infrastructure assets was an important option for financing new infrastructure construction. Five operational roads with an estimated enterprise value of Rs 5,000 crore were being transferred to the NHAI-sponsored Infrastructure Investment Trust for this purpose, she said.Similarly, transmission assets worth Rs 7,000 crore will be transferred to the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, Sitharaman added.Railways will monetise Dedicated Freight Corridor assets for operations and maintenance after commissioning.

01-02-2021||New Delhi||Iron bars hooked between barriers, cement poured in to create makeshift wall at Singhu border||Workers under the watch of police personnel on Monday were seen hooking iron rods between two rows of cement barriers on a flank of the main highway at the Singhu border to further restrict the movement of protesters agitating against the new farm laws at the site.Another portion of the highway at the Delhi-Haryana border is practically blocked now as a makeshift cement wall has come up there.A worker drilling rods in cross-formation between two rows of solid barriers said, “The other flank was done yesterday. Cement is to be poured in the space between the barriers on this flank to make a makeshift wall”.The move comes days after the violent clashes between some protesters and police on January 26 during the tractor parade by the agitating farmers.The section of the highway at the Singhu border, which has been the epicentre of the farmers’ protests for over 60 days, had also seen a clash recently between farmers and a group of people who claimed to be local residents.On Monday, the Delhi side of the Singhu border saw a sparse crowd of protesters while the Haryana side was dominated by vociferous speeches denouncing the new farm laws and clarion calls to infuse a new sense of solidarity in the agitation after the Republic Day incident.Security personnel from the paramilitary forces, RAF and CRPF, were seen in relatively less numbers compared to the past few days but a large number of police personnel manned the stretch spanking a mile from the protest site.Besides the makeshift wall on the highway, a small trench was also dug up earlier across an inner street a little off the highway and cement barricades put up on both the sides.The protesting farmers and leaders at a tent, however, showed no signs of being cowed down and asserted that “these barricades put up around us can’t cage our spirit”.All of them alleged that on January 26, “a conspiracy was made to malign this movement” and “defame it”, and more such attempts are being made while asserting that the agitation has “come out stronger” now.Balwinder Singh Sirsa, a farmer leader from Sirsa, Haryana, exhorted people to not get demotivated by what happened during the January 26 incident, as it was “orchestrated by some people to denigrate the movement”.A woman protester from Haryana, addressing a huge gathering from the dais, said the alleged conspiracy on that day has “failed to weaken this movement” and has rather injected “a new lease of life” in it.Randhir Singh, 85, a farmer from Haryana, also addressed the gathering saying “I have worked with legends Mahendra Singh Tikait and I know how Jat movement was weakened few years ago”.“What happened on January 26 was a conspiracy. It was not done by farmers but all was part of a smear campaign bring run to defame the movement,” he alleged.“We are not terrorists or Khalistani. We are fighting for our rights. Attempts are still being made to defame and weaken us. But Tikait’s tears have awakened the farmers of Haryana, UP, and other states,” he said.

01-02-2021||New Delhi||No rise in retail petrol/diesel prices despite new cess in Budget||The government on Monday imposed agriculture and infrastructure development cess at the rate of Rs 2.5 per litre on petrol and Rs 4 per litre on diesel to mobilise additional resources required for massive investment required in these two key segments of the economy that hold the key to bringing back the country on the path of growth.However, to prevent the additional cess from impacting the retail price of two petroleum products that have already reached historically high levels across the country, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that rates of basic excise duty and special additional excise duty on petrol and diesel are being reduced from the existing levels.Overall, while the agriculture and infrastructure cess will raise the level of taxation on the auto fuels, reduction in excise duty will make the taxation proposal in the budget tax neutral that would keep oil marketing companies away from raising the retail price of petrol and diesel based on the new imposition.The rise in petrol and diesel prices is on hold for the last five days, but before that it had risen 10 times in January with the two auto fuels increasing by Rs 2.59 and Rs 2.61 per litre respectively this month.  Petrol continues to be available at new record high of Rs 86.30 a litre in Delhi while diesel is available in the city at Rs 76.48 a litre. The high retail price in the country is despite the global crude price at $55 per barrel, a lot lower than $80 a barrel in October 2018 when petrol and diesel prices had first reached historic high levels. “The current rate of taxation of petrol and diesel is the prime reason for its high retail prices now. Government should have given a thought to this and reduced taxes so that auto fuels prices remain under check. High prices of fuel have a multiplier effect and impacts pricing of various segments and aids inflation,” said an industry expert asking not to be named. In the budget proposal, while agriculture and infrastructure development cess at the rate of Rs 2.5 per litre on petrol and Rs 4 per litre on diesel has been levied, government has reduced basic excise duty (BED) on petrol from Rs 2.98 a litre to Rs 1.4 a litre and special additional excise duty (SAED) from Rs 12 a litre to Rs 11 a litre. Similarly, for diesel BED has been reduced from Rs 4.83 a litre to Rs 1.8 a litre and BAED from Rs 9 a litre to Rs 8 a litre. Minor correction in retail prices even after this change is expected to be absorbed by oil marketing companies keeping consumers from any further increase in petrol and diesel prices. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-rise-in-retail-petrol-diesel-prices-despite-new-cess-in-budget-206380
01-02-2021||New Delhi||India’s spectacular Australia triumph represents country’s unsuppressed thirst to succeed: FM||The Indian cricket team’s historic Test series triumph in Australia last month was recounted in the budget speech of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who said it epitomises the country’s “unsuppressed thirst to succeed”.The Indian team, ravaged by injuries to most of its key players and without regular skipper Virat Kohli who was on paternity leave, upstaged a full-strength Australia 2-1 in a four-match Test series last month.“I can’t help but recall the joy that we as a cricket-loving nation felt after the team India’s recent spectacular success in Australia,” Sitharaman said on Monday during her speech.“It has reminded us of all the qualities that we as people, particularly our youth, epitomise having abundant promise and the unsuppressed thirst to perform and to succeed,” she added.This came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi appreciated the lion-hearted effort of the side in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ address to the nation.“This month there was some great news from the cricket field. Our cricket team, after crossing initial hurdles, made a brilliant comeback to win the series in Australia. The hard work and team work of our players is inspirational,” he had said.Last week, Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) Krishnamurthy Subramanian had also drawn a cricket analogy to explain how economy could be revitalised with different approaches.“Like in cricket, even in economy, planning matters. When the ball is swinging around a lot, when there is a lot of uncertainty, you need to play carefully and focus on survival.“Essentially, when the ball is swinging, bat like (Cheteshwar) Pujara and when swing is gone, bat like (Rishabh) Pant, which is what Indian policy makers should focus on,” he said during a press conference on the Economic Survey for the year 2020-21.Pujara had resolutely taken several hits to his body while staying put during the fourth Test in Brisbane, while Pant, in contrast, tore apart the Australian bowling attack with his eye-catching strokeplay. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-spectacular-australia-triumph-represents-countrys-unsuppressed-thirst-to-succeed-fm-206375

To earmark resources for this purpose, I propose an Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC) on a small number of items.“However, while applying this cess, we have taken care not to put additional burden on consumers on most items,” the minister said.As per the Budget documents, AIDC of Rs 2.5 per litre has been imposed on petrol and Rs 4 per litre on diesel.“Overall, there would be no additional burden on the consumer,” the minister said.Consequent to the imposition of AIDC on petrol and diesel, the Basic Excise Duty (BED) and Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED) rates have been reduced on them so that overall consumer does not bear any additional burden.Consequently, unbranded petrol and diesel will attract basic excise duty of Rs 1.4, and Rs 1.8 per litre, respectively. The SAED on unbranded petrol and diesel shall be Rs 11 and Rs 8 per litre, respectively. Similar changes have also been made for branded petrol and diesel.The cess on import of ‘gold and silver’ will be 2.5 per cent, alcoholic beverages (100 per cent), crude palm oil (17.5 per cent), apples (35 per cent), ‘coal, lignite and peat’ (1.5 per cent), fertilizers, including urea (5 per cent), and cotton (5 per cent).—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-imposes-cess-on-petrol-diesel-gold-other-items-to-fund-agri-infra-development-206374

01-02-2021||Washington||India, US start discussions on F-15EX multi-role combat aircraft: Boeing||The US and India have held discussions on F-15EX fighter jets and the two respective air forces have exchanged information about it, a top Boeing official has said after the aerospace major received approval from the American government to offer its latest multi-role combat aircraft to the Indian Air Force.The F-15EX is the latest and most advanced version of the multi-role, all-weather, and day and night versions of the F-15 aircraft family.“There have been discussions between the two governments and the two Air Forces have exchanged information about the F-15EX,” Maria H Laine, vice president, Boeing International Sales and Industrial Partnerships told PTI in a joint interview with Jeff Shockey, vice president, Global Sales and Marketing, Boeing Defence, Space & Security and Boeing Global Services.“Since the US Government approved our license request to offer F-15EX to India, we are starting to have more discussions about the platform,” Laine said.The US Air Force awarded Boeing an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract with a ceiling value of nearly $23 billion in July 2020, she added.“It certainly sends a powerful signal when the US government makes a commitment to a platform like this that they’re in it or the long haul and are showing faith and confidence in the capability and price point of the F-15EX — piques interest in the US and around the world,” Shockey said.In April 2019, the IAF issued an RFI (request for information) or initial tender to acquire 114 jets at a cost of around $18 billion, which is billed as one of the world’s biggest military procurements in recent years.The top contenders for the deal include Lockheed’s F-21, Dassault Aviation’s Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Russian aircraft MiG 35 and Saab’s Gripen.Boeing said the F-15EX would be exhibited at the Aero India 2021 in Bengaluru beginning next week.Responding to a question, Laine said the Block III Super Hornet for the Indian Navy was the newest, highly capable, affordable and available attack fighter on offer to India.“We look forward to responding to the RFP (request for proposal) when it is released later this year,” she said.Headed to India to attend the Aero India show in Bengaluru this week, she argued that F/A-18 Super Hornet recently demonstrated its compatibility with Indian Navy carriers by successfully concluding the ski-jump test programme.An F/A-18 Super Hornet selection offered several advantages to India, she said.“With the Super Hornet being the frontline fighter for the US Navy, cooperation between the two navies in naval aviation can unlock the potential of cooperation in naval aviation, with the sharing of best practices in modern naval aviation systems, carrier integration know-how, services and training and weapon systems,” she added.“The F/A-18 can act as force multipliers for the Indian Navy as it can interface with assets such as P-8I. In addition, with both one-seat and two-seat variants, Super Hornet is capable of performing all missions from the carrier, including training,” Laine said.The F/A-18 Super Hornet had the lowest operation and support cost of any tactical aircraft in the US, including single-engine fighters, she said.The US Navy operates more than 600 Super Hornets and Growlers. Multi-billion dollar investments that have gone in infusing new technologies in the aircraft by the US Navy and several international customers.“.....given the current economic environment, customers can benefit from its affordable acquisition cost and cost of operations. The Super Hornet costs less per flight hour to operate than any other tactical aircraft in the US forces inventory, including single-engine fighters, because of its durability and ease of maintenance,” Laine said.

01-02-2021||New Delhi||Budget 2021: FM announces voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old vehicles||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday announced the much-awaited voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and polluting vehicles.Presenting the Budget for 2021-22 in Parliament, Sitharaman said that under voluntary vehicle scrapping policy, personal vehicles would undergo fitness test after 20 years while commercial vehicles would require it after completion of 15 years.She said this will promote fuel-efficient and environment friendly vehicles while cutting on India’s huge import bills.Earlier, Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had said last week that policy to scrap more than 15-year-old vehicles owned by government departments and PSUs is likely to be notified soon and will be implemented from April 1, 2022.The policy is already approved by the government.“The minister... approved the policy of deregistration and scrapping of vehicles owned by government department and PSU, which are above 15 years in age,” the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways had said in a statement.“It is to be notified, and will come into effect from 1st April, 2022,” the statement had said.On July 26, 2019, the government had proposed amendments to motor vehicle norms to allow scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years in a bid to spur adoption of electrical vehicles.“We have submitted the proposal and I am expecting that we will get approval as early as possible for the scrapping policy,” Gadkari had said on January 15.The minister had also said that once the policy is approved, India will become an automobile hub and there will also be reduction in the prices of automobiles.He had said recycled material from old vehicles will help reduce the prices, adding that the automobile industry’s turnover, which is Rs 4.5 lakh crore with Rs 1.45 lakh crore exports, will get a boost.Earlier, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that a policy for scrapping of old vehicles “is in the works” and will be announced after ministries concerned “fine tune” it.In May 2016, the government had floated a draft Voluntary Vehicle Fleet Modernisation Programme (V-VMP) that proposed to take 28 million decade-old vehicles off the road. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/budget-2021-fm-announces-voluntary-vehicle-scrapping-policy-to-phase-out-old-vehicles-206321

01-02-2021||New Delhi||India expresses concern over coup in Myanmar; monitoring situation closely||India on Monday expressed concern over the military coup in Myanmar and detention of its top political leaders, and said the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld in the country.In its reaction to the fast-paced developments in Myanmar, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said India is monitoring the situation closely and that it had been steadfast in supporting the democratic transition in that country.According to reports from Myanmar, the country's powerful military grabbed power in a coup against the civilian government and imposed a state of emergency after detaining Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and other leaders of her National League for Democracy (NLD) in the early hours of Monday."We have noted the developments in Myanmar with deep concern. India has always been steadfast in its support to the process of democratic transition in Myanmar," the MEA said."We believe that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld. We are monitoring the situation closely," it said in a statement.The Myanmarese military staged the coup amid its rising friction with the ruling NLD government over the results of the November 8 general election. The NLD had registered a thumping victory in the polls. However, the military had alleged discrepancies in the electoral process.According to media reports, an announcer on Myanmar's military-owned Myawaddy TV declared on Monday morning that the military had taken control of the country for one year.Myanmar's leader Suu Kyi and other senior figures from the ruling party had been detained in an early morning raid, the spokesman for the governing NLD was quoted as saying in the media.The democratic transition in Myanmar had taken place in 2011 after decades of military rule.

01-02-2021||Washington||Global Indian diaspora seeks repeal of farm laws||Expressing solidarity with agitating Indian farmers, an alliance of various diaspora organisations has demanded the repeal of the three agricultural laws that have caused unrest in the country's farming community.Global Indian Progressive Alliance, which represents more than a dozen and a half diaspora organisations from across the world, demanded that the Indian government recognise the right to peaceful protest, and acknowledge the peaceful protests outside Delhi for the last 60 plus days and of prior farmer protests across the country.India has called the remarks by foreign leaders and organisations on protests by farmers as "ill-informed" and "unwarranted", asserting that the matter pertains to the internal affairs of a democratic country."We have seen some ill-informed comments…relating to farmers in India. Such comments are unwarranted, especially when pertaining to the internal affairs of a democratic country," External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in December.Seeking implementation of the Swaminathan Commission recommendations, representatives of these organisations during a virtual conference demanded the Indian government repeal the laws and submit bills to a parliamentary committee for review and stakeholder engagement as per prior parliamentary norms.“Commit to ensure safety of peaceful dissenters; securing cooperation between law-enforcement agencies and protest organisers in a transparent manner,” the alliance said.“Commit publicly to engaging with protesting groups to address their demands and include stakeholders (in this case, farmer's unions/groups) as part of review of existing laws and bills brought to Parliament going forward,” it said.“As progressive Indians, we are again disturbed to see the ramming through of laws without any attempt at consensus building. There has been no discussion with other political parties, citizen groups, affected stakeholders or academics in developing bills and passing them through Parliament, suppressing even the parliamentary debate process,” the alliance said.Alleging that the government had repeatedly ignored the calls of farmers for greater support, the alliance said that the current rallies outside Delhi were not reflections of dissatisfaction by farmers from Punjab and Haryana alone, but had received support from farmers across the country.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops.Dubbing these laws as "anti-farmer", these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislations would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protesters and the Indian government but the logjam continues.

01-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai suburban train services open for all after 10 months||After a gap of about 320 days, the Railways permitted all members of the general public to travel in local trains in Mumbai from Monday morning, though for limited hours.Help of local police is being taken to manage the crowd and all authorised entry/exit points and ticket counters have been opened for smooth conduct of the services, Central Railway's Chief Public Relations officer Shivaji Sutar said.The general public is allowed to travel in the suburban trains from the time of start of services for the day till 7 am, from noon to 4 pm, and from 9 pm till the closure of services for the day.From 7 am to noon and from 4 pm to 9 pm, only employees of the essential services and categories of commuters specified by the Maharashtra government and the Ministry of Railways are permitted to travel in local trains."Wearing of masks is compulsory and coordination will be ensured with civic authorities for collecting fines from those who violate the Covid prevention norms," Sutar said.The suburban train services, considered the lifeline of Mumbai, were suspended on the midnight of March 22 last year due to the Covid-19 outbreak and gradually resumed from June 15.Sutar said for resuming the local train services for all members of the general public now, they had opened all the authorised entry-exit gates, lifts, escalators and foot over-bridges on the suburban railway stations.All the commercial ticket counters and automatic ticket vending machines have also been opened."There is more deployment of security forces at crowd-sensitive stations," the official said.Random checking of tickets will be done to see that people are travelling as per the time slots allotted to them, he said.After the resumption of local train services in June last year, initially, only essential and emergency services staff were allowed to travel in the suburban trains.Later, various other categories of commuters, including women, were allowed during restricted hours.Currently, a total of 2,985 local train services are being operated on the Mumbai suburban network.These constitute about 95 per cent of the total 3,141 services, which were being operated collectively by the Central Railway (CR) and the Western Railway (WR) before the coronavirus outbreak, railway officials said.Out of these, 204 special suburban services were added on Friday, they said.During normal times before the lockdown, the CR used to operate 1,774 services, while the WR ran 1,367 services on the suburban network.

The Sanyukta Kisan Morcha will also unveil its nationwide programme tomorrow in the wake of the happenings, including arrests, following the January 26 Delhi violence.However, observers are sensing “hint of differences” among various groups that are now part of the movement. The presence of political leaders at the Ghazipur protest site is also being frowned upon.In today’s mahapanchayat at Baghpat, where leaders of several khaps supported the Ghazipur agitation, BKU president Naresh Tikait was not present.Much is also being read in some of his statements in the past 24 hours.A day after PM Modi said his government was just a “phone call away” for talks with them, Tikait said farmers respect the PM’s dignity and do not want him or the government or Parliament to bow down to them.Calling for a “respectful solution”, the brother of Rakesh Tikait, whose tears virtually changed the shape of the agitation, however, also said they would not “agree to anything under pressure”.Meanwhile, prominent Gujjar leader of western Uttar Pradesh Madan Bhaiyya has extended his community’s support to the BKU and also slammed BJP’s Loni MLA Nand Kishor Gujjar, who has been accused of “inciting and orchestrating violence” at the Ghazipur protest site on January 26, though Kishor has denied the allegations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mahapanchayats-farmers-agitation-gaining-ground-206219

Most of these surgeries are conducted without prior, free and fully informed autonomous consent,” says petitioner Aqsa Shaikh of the Association of Transgender Health in India.‘Done without prior approval’There are several instances where intersex people are treated as disabled and approached through a medical lens leading to sex reassignment interventions that cause long-term complications in them. Most of these surgeries are conducted without prior approval —Aqsa Shaikh, Petitioner, association of transgender health in indiaThe petitioners cited the landmark April 15, 2014, Supreme Court judgment in the National Legal Services Authority versus Union of India case to argue their case. The SC order states, “No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgeries, sterilisations, hormonal therapy as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity.”The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court had also, on April 22, 2019, relied upon the above SC judgment to direct Tamil Nadu to ban sex reassignment surgeries.“Tamil Nadu subsequently became the first Indian state to ban sex reassignment surgeries in intersex children,” Shaikh said.On the policy front, little has been done to address the challenge even after the UN Committee for the Rights of Persons with Disability in its September 2019 recommendations to the Government of India urged it to “take measures to prevent sex normalising surgeries in intersex children and guarantee the rights of intersex people to maintain physical and mental integrity”.Some Indian doctors, however, continue to perform medically unnecessary normalising surgeries on infants even when the results are often catastrophic and the supposed benefits unproven, says Gopi Shankar Madurai, adviser to DCPCR.The DCPCR in its order directing a ban on sex reassignment interventions on transgender children relied on the evidence provided by petitioners and on the opinion of independent experts.The Delhi Government, meanwhile, said it had constituted a committee to look at the issue. Petitioners in this landmark case include Satendra Singh, Founder, Doctors with Disabilities, and Air Cmde Sanjay Sharma (retd).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-subject-intersex-infants-to-needless-surgeries-delhi-panel-206239

The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister have both already hinted that there will be announcements for various sectors.Fifth crisis-era BudgetFirst half of session to end on Feb 13The government this year has ample room to borrow to make up for the massive loss of direct tax revenue and non-tax income such as disinvestment, where it missed the target by a wide margin.The challenge before the government is to generate resources to increase growth and maintain the distribution of welfare benefits. As the Economic Survey has amply hinted, the government will be attempting to raise borrowings in the form of debt.After presenting the Budget in 2020, the pandemic months saw Sitharaman continue the process with almost a dozen press conferences — some to announce relief measures, others to deliver economic policy statements.The situation did warrant such intra-Budget interventions because the demand-driven slowdown that led to large-scale unemployment and income loss began even before the pandemic.No hard copies, budget on AppA “Union Budget mobile app” will make Budget documents available in the public domain this year. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had dispensed with the practice of using a briefcase to carry budget papers while presenting her maiden Budget last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/budget-today-booster-shot-needed-to-revive-economy-206044
01-02-2021||Aditi Tandon||Covid crisis may drive more funds to prop health sector||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 31After Covid-19 showed how a public health crisis can lead to an economic and social crisis, the Union Budget is likely to reflect a shift in the government policy towards higher allocations to the sector where public spending hovers at a meagre 1 per cent of the GDP.Focus is expected on boosting primary health infrastructure, disease surveillance mechanisms and cutting out-of-pocket expenditures on health by strengthening the flagship Ayushman Bharat project which has two pillars – health and wellness centres at the primary level and cashless hospitalisation for 10 crore poor families with a financial cover of Rs 5 lakh a year.Government sources indicate that the Budget could focus on reducing India’s out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE), one of the highest in the world. High OOPE contributes directly to a high incidence of catastrophic expenditures and poverty.Official projections say an increase in public spending from 1 per cent to 2.5-3 per cent of the GDP – envisaged in the National Health Policy, 2017 – can decrease the OOPE from 65 per cent to 30 per cent of the overall healthcare spending.So a further boost to the PM Jan Aarogya Yojna under Ayushman Bharat could help achieve the goal of improved access to equitable, affordable and accountable healthcare system.The World Health Organisation has also stressed the merits of investment in health by showing that health affects domestic economic growth directly through labour productivity and increasing life expectancy from 50 to 70 years (a 40 per cent increase) could raise the economic growth rate by 1.4 percentage points per year.Health Ministry sources say a major learning from the pandemic has been that even the infrastructure created by greater healthcare spending in the advanced economies could not deal with the disease burden created by the pandemic.“Better health infrastructure is no guarantee that a country would be able to deal better with devastating pandemics like Covid-19. As the next health crisis could possibly be drastically different from Covid, the focus must be on building the healthcare system for long-term goals generally rather than have a specific focus on communicable diseases,” the Economic Survey 2020-2021 has said, advising the government to create at least one ward in each hospital that can be converted quickly for emergency use.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-crisis-may-drive-more-funds-to-prop-health-sector-206084

The first high-speed trial of the jet will start in 2023 and we expect the production to start somewhere around 2025,” Madhavan added.Asked about the weapon package for Tejas Mark II, the chief of the state-run aerospace giant did not give a direct reply and said it would be decided at a later stage depending on the requirement and changing dynamics.Tejas is a single-engine and highly agile multi-role supersonic fighter capable of operating in high-threat air environments. The aircraft, manufactured by the HAL, is a potent platform for air combat and offensive air support with reconnaissance and anti-ship operations as its secondary roles.The Tejas Mk-IA will be equipped with active electronically scanned array radar, beyond visual range missile, electronic warfare suite and air-to-air refuelling system.On the next generation advanced multi-role combat aircraft (AMCA) project, the HAL chairman said the aim was to implement the project under the framework of a special purpose vehicle (SPV), also involving private sector players.India is working on the fifth-generation medium weight deep penetration fighter jet and the project is estimated to cost around USD 5 billion.Madhavan said the aircraft prototype is likely to be ready by 2026 and its production could start by 2030. He added that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is working on the project timeline. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/more-potent-tejas-mark-ii-to-roll-out-next-year-hal-chief-206161

Lashing out at “dynastic politics” in the TMC, Shah alleged that Banerjee had been working towards the “nephew’s welfare” rather than the well-being of the masses.“Wherever under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the NDA has formed the government in the states they are working towards ‘Jan Kalyan’ (welfare of the masses) to provide services at doorsteps, but here in Bengal the only agenda of the Mamata dispensation is to ensure that the nephew becomes the next chief minister.”“The government of Mamata didi is busy towards ‘Bhatija Kalyan’ (welfare of the nephew) in Bengal,” he added. — PTITMC looted rations during covid: IraniDumurjala (WB): Accusing the ruling Trinamool Congress in West Bengal of indulging in corruption, Union Minister Smriti Irani said here on Sunday that while PM Narendra Modi provided foodgrain for 80 crore people of the country for eight months during the pandemic, the rations were looted by the party in the state.

That is what we are doing. —Narendra Modi, Prime Minister“Swami Vivekananda wanted empowerment to be taken to the poor if the poor are unable to empower themselves. That is what we are doing. If the poor cannot access banks, the banks should go to the poor. That’s Jan Dhan scheme. If the poor can’t access healthcare, hospitals should go to the poor. That’s Ayushman Bharat. Roads, power and water, we are taking everything to the poor. This is igniting aspirations among them and these aspirations are driving India’s growth,” the PM said, quoting Swami Vivekananda’s lectures on Vedanta where he said setbacks must be seen as part of the learning curve.Recalling Swami Vivekananda’s belief in India’s youth as the powerhouse of skills and self-confidence, the PM said today’s youth were proving across sectors, from sports to innovation, how to push boundaries and make the “impossible into possible”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-offering-solutions-to-worlds-problems-pm-206172

The Samyukta Kisan Morcha will also unveil its nationwide programme tomorrow in the wake of the happenings, including arrests, following the January 26 Delhi violence.At the same time, observers are also sensing “hint of differences” among various groups that are now part of the movement. The presence of political leaders at the Ghazipur protest site is also being frowned upon.In today’s ‘mahapanchayat’ in Baghpat, where leaders of several khaps supported the Ghazipur agitation, BKU president Naresh Tikait was not present.Much is also being read in some of his statements in past 24 hours.A day after PM Modi said his government was just a “phone call away” for talks with them, Naresh Tikait said farmers respect the dignity of the Prime Minister and do not want him or the government or Parliament bow down to them.“Prime Minister should ensure that the self-respect of farmers is protected…a middle way should be found…and talks should be held,” Naresh Tikat was also quoted as saying.Calling for a “respectful solution”, the brother of Rakesh Tikait whose tears virtually changed the shape of the agitation, however, also said they will not “agree to anything under pressure”.Tikait said the government should release those arrested after the January 26 Delhi violence and prepare a conducive environment for talks.Speaking to the media at Singhu, representatives of the 32 Punjab unions said they will not make the first move (for talks with the government). “Unions are ready for talks but the message should come from the government; the government should make atmosphere conducive for talks; the three laws should be repealed and a law for MSP formulated,” is what Punjab unions broadly said.While observers are sensing “differences” between various ‘khaps’ in Western UP, the presence of political leaders at Ghazipur is also being viewed as contrary to the collective decision of SKM.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal today met Rakesh Tikait and assured him of all the support in the ongoing farmers’ protest against the three farm laws.Meanwhile, prominent Gujjar leader of western Uttar Pradesh Madan Bhaiyya has extended his community’s support to the BKU and also slammed BJP’s Loni MLA Nand Kishor Gujjar, who has been accused of “inciting and orchestrating violence” at the Ghazipur protest site on January 26, though Nand Kishor has denied the allegations.Prime Minister Modi yesterday said his government’s offer on agri laws made to protesting farmers “still stands” and the Centre was just a “phone call away”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/series-of-mahapanchayats-farmers-agitation-gains-ground-despite-pms-offer-206021
01-02-2021||Aditi Tandon||A first: Centre issues fact-sheet on farm laws, says mandis, MSP unaffected||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, Jan 31Amid a raging farmers’ agitation and opposition’s accusations that the new farm laws will demolish the mandis and the MSP system, the Government Sunday issued a first-of-its-kind detailed fact sheet to dispel “incorrect information” on the laws and reiterated that the mandi system and MSP regime will not be affected by new legislations.A day after NCP chief Sharad Pawar attacked the Centre for bringing laws to destroy the mandi system, Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar in a series of tweets countered Pawar.Tomar said it was incorrect to say that the new laws placed the private agricultural business out of the ambit of the mandi system.“Under the new laws state governments continue to have the power under the APMC Act to notify warehouses, private markets, yards and sub yards. New law is operative in trade areas outside the structures notified under the APMC Act,” said Tomar as the Centre worked to dispel what it calls myths about the laws.Tomar rejected opposition’s insinuations that the new law demolishes mandi system and APMCs will be choked for funds damaging the infrastructure for MSP procurements.“This is incorrect. Mandis will continue to levy fees and other charges prescribed under the APMC Act. Mandis can be further strengthened through Central government investment in marketing infrastructure,” said Tomar.Since he speaks with some experience and expertise on the issue, it was dismaying to see his tweets employ a mix of ignorance & misinformation on the agriculture reforms. Let me take this opportunity to present some facts. pic.twitter.com/8CZ1AzKYoR  He also reacted to farmers’ and opposition’s apprehensions regarding the amended Essential Commodities Act which proposes to remove stockpiling limits on foodgrain, pulses, onion, potato, oilseeds.“There are concerns that corporates may purchase commodities at lower rates and stockpile and sell at higher prices to consumers. This apprehension has no basis. Under the Act the Centre can intervene in case of extraordinary circumstances including war, famine, extraordinary price rise and natural calamities of grave nature,” said Tomar.He said to argue that new laws restricted APMC or state government from collecting levy or fees from private markets is also wrong.“APMC and states can collect fees from private markets which have been notified under the APMC Act,” the minister clarified.On opposition’s charges that the new law designates SDM or higher officials for arbitration in dispute resolution, Tomar said, “This is incorrect. Mandi committees will continue under the APMC Act. New law provides for a pro farmer measure at tehsil level coordination board where farmers are represented. Additional provisions for dispute resolution at sub divisional authority and thereafter by collector are farmer friendly measures to avoid costly litigation.”The government also said Sharad Pawar’s argument about new laws empowering the Centre to issue licences to those who are not part of agri trade organisations is wrong.“Mandi committees will continue to issue licences under the APMC Act. Under new law there is no need of any licence for any person, farmer producer organisations or agricultural cooperatives for trading. Traders only need a valid PAN card under IT Act,” said Tomar.He added that the opposition was incorrect in saying that the new laws brought agri trade subjects under Union government.“The Centre is legally empowered to legislate on agri trade while legislations on agri markets remain within the power of the states. Also it is wrong to say that new laws allow the union government to permit large corporates for e trading which will not be part of mandi system. The fact is several corporates have been involved in e-trading but so far there is no protection to farmers against exploitation. New laws provide for legal protection to farmers on e trading platforms in trade areas outside the APMC,” Tomar clarified.“Since Sharad Pawar speaks with some experience and expertise on the issue, it was dismaying to see his tweets employ a mix of ignorance and misinformation on the agriculture reforms. Let me take this opportunity to present some facts. As he is such a veteran leader, I would like to believe that he was genuinely misinformed of the facts. Now that he has the right facts, I hope he will also change his stand and & also explain the benefits to our farmers,” said Tomar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-first-centre-issues-fact-sheet-on-farm-laws-says-mandis-msp-unaffected-206010
01-02-2021||---||Panel formed to trace persons missing since January 26: Samyukta Kisan Morcha||Sonepat, January 31Farmer leaders on Sunday said a committee has been formed to trace those missing after the January 26 'tractor march' to Delhi.Addressing mediapersons, Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 32 farmer organisations, said, “As many as 163 people who have been arrested by the Delhi Police have been identified.”Farmer leaders alleged the police and Central government were not forthcoming with the information about the missing people.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha said it is now seeking to compile information on such missing persons following which formal action can be initiated with the authorities.The committee formed to look into the issues includes Prem Singh Bhangu, Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala, Avtar Singh, Kiranjit Singh Sekhon and Bajleet Singh.“Any information on missing persons can be shared with 8198022033 with full name of the missing person, full address, phone number of the person and any other contact number at home and missing from when,” the Morcha added.The farmer leaders also condemned the arrests of journalists like Mandeep Punia and others on false and fabricated charges, “out of the government’s great fear of being exposed for its real conspiracy and out of fear of the rising strength of the farmers’ movement”.SKM also condemned the alleged attack of the government on the farmers’ movement in cutting off internet services of different protest sites.It questioned the cordoning off of the protest sites from a long distance disallowing ordinary people and mediapersons from reaching Singhu border. This is also to disrupt basic supplies like food and water.In a release, SKM said, “Despite multiple attempts of violence by police and government, farmers are still debating on three farm laws and MSP. We regret to share the sad news of the death of one more protester from Maharashtra who took part in the Shahjahanpur struggle today. Shayra Pawara was just 21-year-old and her sacrifice will be remembered and will not go wasted.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/panel-formed-to-trace-persons-missing-since-january-26-samyukta-kisan-morcha-206002
