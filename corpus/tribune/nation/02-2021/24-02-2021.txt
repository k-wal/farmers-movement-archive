Attacks on India made up 7 per cent of all attacks X-Force observed on Asia in 2020. “Finance and insurance was the top attacked industry in India (60 per cent), followed by manufacturing and professional services,” the report said. Ransomware was the top attack type, accounting for around 40 per cent of total cyber attacks.In addition, X-Force observed digital currency mining and server access attacks had hit Indian companies last year.“We also witnessed cybercriminals using relief efforts and public health information as spam lures including targeted attacks on critical components of the vaccine supply chain. These all remain issues in 2021,” Sudeep Das, Security Software Technical Sales Leader, IBM Technology Sales, India/South Asia, said in a statement. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-2nd-biggest-target-of-cyber-criminals-in-asia-pacific-in-2020-ibm-216999

Khan made the offer after being received by his counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa at the airport and given a red-carpet welcome accompanied by a 19-gun saluteIndia too has been offering defence LOC and activating different types of connectivity projects with neighbouring countries. However, New Delhi’s bid to start a container project in Sri Lanka has not borne fruit so far despite an in-person visit by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to wrap up its loose ends.Though Pakistan has supplied arms to Sri Lanka, India has far substantial footprints of security and defence cooperation as well as much greater economic and developmental involvement.“Pakistan is part of the One Belt and Road initiative of China, and CPEC is one of its flagship programmes. And it means connectivity,” said Imran Khan while offering connectivity up to Central Asia.Imran Khan is the first world leader to visit Sri Lanka since the Covid pandemic struck in March last year. He met his counterpart Mahinda Rajapaksa and called on President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.The Pakistan PM also led delegation-level talks that reportedly covered trade and investment, health and education, defence and security, and culture and tourism, according to the Pakistani Foreign Ministry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/imran-replicates-indias-offer-to-sri-lanka-216998

State by itself has not been given any right to move the SC under Article 32 under any circumstances.“The state of Uttar Pradesh is not competent to file the petition as it is neither a citizen to whom the right is conferred and neither it has any fundamental rights which are violated and therefore can be enforced by this court. The very basis of the writ petition filed by Uttar Pradesh is faulty and fallacious and deserves to be dismissed,” Punjab government told the top court.The submission was made in response to a plea filed by Uttar Pradesh seeking a direction to Punjab government and Rupnagar jail authority to immediately hand over the custody of Ansari to district jail Banda.It has also sought a direction to transfer the criminal proceedings and trial in the extortion case in Punjab to the special court in Allahabad.Ansari is lodged in district jail Rupnagar in Punjab since January 2019.In its affidavit filed in the apex court, Punjab had referred to the medical condition of Ansari and said he had been undergoing treatment at jail hospital as well as other hospitals from time to time since January 2019.While referring to the medical condition and advice of doctors, it has said that custody of Ansari “could not be handed over to the state of Uttar Pradesh due to the specific advice of the medical officers/medical board/specialists” from time to time.

24-02-2021||New Delhi||Slightly high fare of short distance trains to discourage unnecessary travel: Railways||After concerns were raised over a rise in the ticket fares of short-distance passenger trains, the railways on Wednesday said the “slightly high fares” are only to discourage unnecessary travel.Since the coronavirus-triggered lockdown was eased, the railways is running only special trains. It started with long-distance trains and now, even short-distance passenger trains are being run as special trains.As a special provision in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, the fares of these trains have been fixed at par with the price of unreserved tickets of mail and express trains for the same distance, a statement from the Railway Ministry said.The railways, which has now started operating passenger or local train services, has come under fire from daily commuters, who are feeling the pinch of the rise in the fares.For example, a ticket from Amritsar to Pathankot costs Rs 55 now. Earlier, it was priced at Rs 25. Similarly, a ticket of a passenger DMU between the Jalandhar City railway station and Ferozpur costs Rs 60 now, while it used to cost Rs 30 earlier.“Railways would like to inform that these slightly higher fares for passenger and other short distance trains had been introduced to discourage people from avoidable travels and those which are not most necessary.“Covid is still around and in fact, worsening in some states. Visitors from many states are being subjected to screening in other areas and discouraged to travel. Little higher price is to be seen as a pro-active measure of Railways to prevent crowding in trains and stop Covid from spreading,” the statement said.It may be recalled that the Indian Railways stopped regular train operations on March 22, 2020 as a measure to curb the spread of the coronavirus and a nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, which came into force from the next day.The railways is constantly increasing the number of passenger-carrying trains in a graded manner. Full restoration of the regular services of passenger trains to the pre-COVID times is to be considered keeping in view a range of factors and operational circumstances.Currently, the railways has operationalised almost 65 per cent of the mail and express trains and over 90 per cent of the suburban services as compared to the pre-lockdown times.On an average, 1,250 mail and express trains, 5,350 suburban services and more than 326 passenger trains are presently in operation on a daily basis.The statement from the ministry said the short-distance passenger trains account for less than three per cent of the total number of trains being operated.“Keeping in view the prevailing COVID situation, after introduction of Mail/Express trains, Railways is gradually operationalising passenger trains, taking all necessary precautions and making additional efforts.“It may be noted that passenger operations have always been subsidised by Railways. Normally, Railways bears a loss on every journey by a passenger. Officials maintain that despite the hike, Railways still remained a cheaper option to travel,” it added.Trains are being run under the most challenging circumstances due to COVID-19 and many are being operated in spite of a low occupancy for the benefit of people, the railway ministry said.The railways has also taken special care about those travelling by paying the lowest fare on trains so that even in the times of COVID-19, they bear the least burden. Besides other classes, the trains that are being run have a large number of “2S” (second seating) coaches that have the lowest fare in the reserved category.Forty per cent of the passengers have travelled in the “2S” class in much better travelling conditions compared to the pre-COVID unreserved travelling situations, officials said.“With a view to regulate rush at stations and in trains, passenger trains are being charged slightly more fare than pre-Covid times and a close watch is being kept on its patronisation. The situation is being constantly monitored to ensure restoration of services in keeping with the protocols necessary to be followed during Covid times,” the statement from the ministry said.The passengers of the long-distance or mail and express trains that are being operated as special services are, however, paying 10 to 30 per cent higher fares since the services began post lockdown.These fares are being charged under the ticket and refund rules of 2015, which stipulate a higher fare for special trains. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/slightly-high-fare-of-short-distance-trains-to-discourage-unnecessary-travel-railways-216990

We cannot be looking into individual cases and start modifying our judgement. There is something called judicial discipline,” a Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah said.The Bench, however, granted the counsel for Lt. Col. (Retd.) Priamvada A Mardikar, to approach the Armed Forces Tribunal with her grievances.It also asked senior advocate R Balasubramanian, appearing for the Defence Ministry, to use his “good office” in trying to get the grievances of the former Army officer resolved.“I will certainly use my good office to ensure that her issue is considered,” the lawyer assured the Bench during the hearing conducted through video conferencing.The court noted the arguments of lawyer SS Pandey, appearing for the former woman officer, that there were two similarly-placed officers and one of them was granted the permanent commission and the second was denied and she later retired.The lawyer said it was held by the top court in the verdict that the women officers, who retired during the pendency of the case, will be getting the retirement benefits as commissioned officers.Permanent commission has been granted to Short Service Commissioned officers in all the ten streams of the Indian Army including Army Air Defense (AAD), Signals, Engineers and Army Aviation.                 Justice Chandrachud had authored the last year verdict which had said that as a one-time measure, the benefit of continuing in service until the attainment of 20 years pensionable service shall also apply to all the existing SSC officers with more than fourteen years of services.It had held that the option of grant of permanent commission shall be given to all women SSC officers and if those with more than 14 years of service do not opt for it then they will be entitled to continue in service until they attain 20 years of pensionable services.While granting permanent commission to women officers in Army, it had rejected the Centre’s stand of their physiological limitations as being based on “sex stereotypes” and “gender discrimination against women”.The top court had accepted the Centre’s policy of February 25, 2019 to grant permanent commission to SSC women officers in all the 10 streams in the Army.The top court had said SSC women officers with over 20 years of service who are not granted permanent commission shall retire on pension in terms of policy decision.It had noted that Indian Army has sanctioned 50,266 posts for officers, while the posts currently occupied are 40,825 including 1,653 by women officers.It had noted that there is a shortage of 9,441 officers in the Indian Army. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cannot-modify-verdict-granting-permanent-commission-to-women-on-individual-pleas-sc-216979

Out of this Telangana got just 10,000 jobs in 10 years.Addressing the media at the local TRS Bhawan said his government filled 1.32 lakh jobs in the last six years. “I am sharing official statistics and am ready for a debate on recruitments carried out by the TRS government,” KTR said.Taking on the BJP he said, “The BJP leaders should come up with their achievements before seeking votes.”He said there has to be a committed effort to address long-pending demands pertaining to the State before seeking votes here. “The Central government had announced 157 medical colleges but not a single college has been allocated to Telangana. Despite BJP being in power at the Centre, the State BJP leaders could not get new projects or get required funds for the existing ones,” he added.He said the TRS candidate for the Mahabubnagar – Ranga Reddy – Hyderabad Graduates Constituency Surabhi Vani Devi had all the qualifications to contest the elections. “She is humble, polite and service-oriented.

24-02-2021||New Delhi||India dispatches first batch of six lakh COVID vaccine doses to Ghana||India on Wednesday dispatched the first batch of six lakh COVID-19 vaccine doses to the African country of Ghana under the COVAX facility in collaboration with the UNICEF, which aims to cover 92 countries under the initiative.The doses are a part of the first batch of COVID-19 vaccine the country is acquiring through the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX), which Ghana among nearly 92 countries have signed into.Speaking to PTI, Yasmine Ali Haque, Representative, UNICEF India, said that six lakh doses of Astra Zeneca vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII) were sent to Ghana from Pune, via Mumbai and Dubai.“The doses arrived in Ghana at noon, Indian time. In the coming week, Cote d’Ivoire, a country in western Africa, will also get it in the coming days. Out of the 92 countries, which are the beneficiaries of the COVAX facility, 85 are low-income and middle-income countries.“It is the beginning of our aim to deliver two billion doses to around 100 countries around the world. By March, we aim to deliver 80 million doses and by December, two billion should be delivered across the world. Our target is especially the low-income and middle-income countries and to protect frontline and healthcare workers as well as high risk and vulnerable people,” Haque told PTI.She said that UNICEF also aims to deliver up to one billion syringes by year-end across the world and 520 million syringes will come from the stockpile UNICEF created in 2020, while the rest will be delivered direct from the manufacturer to the countries.Haque, however, could not name which country will receive the next consignment of the vaccine due to non-availability of the list with her.Also read: Ghana is first nation in world to receive COVAX vaccinesAs part of the COVAX facility, United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) is leading efforts, in collaboration with Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) Revolving Fund, to procure and supply COVID-19 vaccine doses for these countries on behalf of the COVAX facility.Of these, PAHO will be procuring and supplying doses to 10 nations in Latin America, which are Bolivia, Dominica, El Salvador, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, an official source said.“UNICEF is closely working with vaccine manufacturers since November 2020 to ensure the vaccines are delivered in a safe manner, and we also ensure communication with communities and work on the ground to support national governments,” Haque said, adding that India is also one of the beneficiaries under the COVAX facility. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-dispatches-first-batch-of-six-lakh-covid-vaccine-doses-to-ghana-216956
24-02-2021||New Delhi||HC shocked by murder of undertrial in Tihar jail||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday expressed shock at the murder of a Tihar Jail inmate who was knifed to death inside the prison, saying that such things are only seen in fiction.“I don’t know how something like this can happen. It is shocking. We see such things only in fiction,” Justice Prathiba M Singh said while hearing a plea moved by the victim’s father seeking Rs 5 crore as compensation for the custodial death of his son.The high court directed the prison authorities, represented by Delhi government additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose and advocate Naman Jain, and the police to file a status report indicating whether an FIR has been lodged in connection with the incident and if so, the status of the investigation.The court further said the report shall also indicate whether the CCTV footage of the cell where the victim was housed has been recovered and preserved and if yes, in what manner.It also asked whether any charge sheet has been filed in the case and if so, the status of the trial in the case.The court also said the victim’s father—Ali Sher—be kept informed about the developments in the investigation or trial of the case.With these directions, the court listed the matter for hearing on March 5.During the hearing, Ghose too said “it was a matter of great concern” that something like this has happened in the national capital.He said there were nine wounds on the victim’s body.Sher, in his plea filed through advocates Anwar A Khan and Vishal Raj Sehijpal, has said his son—Dilsher Azad—was an undertrial prisoner in Tihar Jail since September 2019.On November 30, 2020, he received a call from police officials informing him about the death of his son, but when he reached the jail, the prison authorities did not cooperate with him and he was not told the real cause of death.After Sher called a lawyer he was informed that his son was stabbed to death with knives, the petition has claimed and added that the body was handed over on December 1, 2020.The petition further claims that Sher had written complaints and sent representations to the Human Rights Commissioner, Lt. Governor, the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court, Chief Minister of Delhi and DG Prisons, for action against the erring officials and for compensation,  but till date nothing has been done or communicated to him.

24-02-2021||New Delhi||Mutants different from variants, COVID appropriate behaviour vital to stop spread: Scientists||More than 7,000 SARS-CoV-2 mutations have been documented, but that doesn’t translate to variants, say scientists, emphasising the distinction between the two and cautioning that the spike in cases in some states is likely due to non-adherence of COVID-19 appropriate behaviour.If safety protocols are not followed, new versions that can spread faster or dominate the previous version could emerge, they warned as worries mounted over a recent study showing 7,684 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome in India.Though the study from Hyderabad’s CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology is alarming and led to panic in some quarters, some mutations are only to be expected.According to Rakesh Mishra, CSIR-CCMB director and study co-author, 7,684 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome were documented from the data analysis of 6,017 genomes sequenced so far.“That doesn’t mean 7,000 variants are going around in the country. This only shows that the virus is mutating as expected, and we have documented what these mutations are,” Mishra told PTI.He added that it is difficult to say right now how many variants there are in the country.A mutation means a change in a nucleic acid base or amino acid molecule, and a virus containing this change is termed a mutant, explained virologist Upasana Ray.Mutations eventually accumulate to generate variants that differ from the original virus more and more, and so, a variant can have limited or even cumulative mutations, she added.While it is not surprising to find many new mutations, it is important to sequence and document them, said the senior scientist at Kolkata’s CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology.“Not all mutations would even linger around in the population for long. Some remain, some fade off,” Ray told PTI.Mutation is not unique to SARS-CoV-2, she said. The longer a virus stays in the population and spreads, the more the mutations and hence more variants.“If a virus attains a significant degree of change from its original form so that there is a major change in antigenic epitopes, it has a chance to escape the immunity offered by the existing vaccines,” Ray said.An epitope is the part of virus cells that is recognised by the immune system.The analysis by CSIR-CCMB found that novel variants worrying many countries globally have so far only low prevalence in India. These include the variants with the immune-escape E484K mutation and the one with the N501Y mutation found to have a higher transmission rate. While the E484K mutation is found in both the South African and Brazil variant lineages, the N501Y mutation is found in the UK variant.But the low prevalence in the country might be simply because not enough sequencing has been done, the authors of the study said, calling for robust sequencing of coronavirus genomes across India.Noted virologist Shahid Jameel said there are currently 5,261 SARS-CoV-2 sequence entries from India in the GISAID database, a global science initiative that provides genomic data of the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.“With 11 million confirmed cases, that is a sequencing rate of under 0.05 per cent,” Jameel, director, Trivedi School of Biosciences, Ashoka University, told PTI.In his view, there isn’t enough information on mutations, especially variant lineages in India, due to low sequencing.“In the absence of that, I would say the surge is most likely due to non-adherence to COVID appropriate behaviour,” Jameel added.“There are only four patients from Maharashtra recently in whom a mutation called E484Q has been seen. This change is not as drastic as E484K, which is found in the South African and Brazil variant lineages.“Since clinical and epidemiological correlations have not been done yet, we can’t say if this is the cause of rising cases. Unless we see more of this, four cases are not enough to make that claim,” Jameel said.He, however, cautioned that it is important to understand that more transmission will increase the chances of mutations developing.“So Covid appropriate behaviour also cuts down on the development of variant viruses,” he said.Mishra agreed that the current surge in certain states is less likely due to some new variant, and more likely due to people ignoring COVID protocols.“I don’t see any recent superspreader events till now, because whatever sequencing has been done doesn’t point to any new fast-spreading variant in the country,” he added.Mishra also emphasised that the findings do suggest the likelihood of new variants arising if continuous mutations in the virus genome are discovered.“Sequencing of the genome to look for mutations is to keep a track of the virus genome so as to check what this will hold for vaccine and drug efficacy. For example, the UK variant has around 17 mutations in its genome,” he said.Ray said even vaccination can put a virus under stress and change it to a form (variant) that can evade the immune response, adding that the chance of this is low if mass immunisations are done faster.According to Jameel, a mutation is a normal consequence of a virus multiplication, but it is hard to say what is a normal number.“The spike protein changes—due to mutation in the spike gene—have not shown anything that would compromise vaccine efficacy,” he noted.The spike protein helps the virus enter human cells.There has been a rise in the number of daily infections in five states: Maharashtra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, and Madhya Pradesh in the past few days. Of these, Maharashtra and Kerala are the most worrying, accounting for about 75 per cent of the total active COVID-19 cases in the country.                       “The N440K and E484Q variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in Maharashtra, Kerala, and Telangana. Also, three other mutated strains—one each from the UK, South Africa, and Brazil are already present in the country,” NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul said in a press conference in New Delhi on Tuesday.“But there is no reason for us to believe presently, on the basis of scientific information, that they are responsible for the upsurge of the outbreak in some districts of Maharashtra and Kerala,” Paul said.With 13,742 new infections, India’s COVID-19 count has gone up to 1,10,30,176 while  recoveries are at 1,07,26,702, according to Union Health Ministry data updated on Wednesday.There are 1,46,907 active cases of coronavirus infections in the country, which comprises 1.33 per cent of the total caseload, the data stated. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mutants-different-from-variants-covid-appropriate-behaviour-vital-to-stop-spread-scientists-216948

24-02-2021||New Delhi||India plans joint forays in India Pacific with France, Australia||India on Wednesday discussed the nuts and bolts of advancing trilateral cooperation with France and Australia in the Indo-Pacific which is seeing increasing Chinese military assertiveness.The virtual interaction at the senior diplomats’ level was a follow up of a trilateral between the foreign secretaries about six months back.“The three sides took stock of the progress made on the outcomes of the Foreign Secretary-level Trilateral Dialogue held in September 2020, including maritime security, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), blue economy and cooperation in multilateral fora,” said a MEA statement.India sees France and Australia as having a significant presence in certain parts of the Indian Ocean and feels it can combine with the two to significantly shape the maritime environment without the direct involvement of the US.The trilateral also discussed partnerships at the regional level such as with ASEAN, Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) and the Indian Ocean Commission.The unstated purpose of the trilateral is to counter China, the same purpose for which the US-led Quad has taken shape.India is also looking at giving substance to a trilateral with Russia and Japan for forays in the Russian Far East and the Northern Sea Route in the Arctic, again with the implicit purpose of reducing China’s salience.Ironically, the first trilateral India has been involved in has China as its member besides Russia.A French read-out of the trilateral of secretaries was explicit about the purpose – to underscore the goal of guaranteeing peace, security and adherence to international law in the Indo-Pacific by drawing on the excellence of bilateral relations between France, India and Australia.While the dialogue between the secretaries will be held on an annual basis, the trilateral of senior officials is expected to keep imparting momentum to the concept.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-plans-joint-forays-in-india-pacific-with-france-australia-216937
24-02-2021||Kollam (Ker)||I admire what you do: Rahul Gandhi tells fishermen of Kerala; sails with them||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday turned seafarer and pulled the net with local fishermen in high sea here to get a taste of their life and understand the issues facing them.In an emotional talk with thousands of fisherfolk, including women gathered at the Thangassery beach in this southern coastal district, the Nehru scion said he admired and respected what the fishermen do."I understand and respect what you do. I admire what you are doing. Many times, we eat the fish but we will not understand the hard work behind and how it reached our plate," Gandhi said.The Wayanad MP ventured into the sea with some fishermen in their boat from Vadi beach here around 4.30 am and spent nearly an hour with them before reaching the venue of interaction.Gandhi also cast the net with them but could only catch one squid.Clad in blue t-shirt and khaki trousers, the Congress leader could be seen waving hands to the onlookers from the boat while reaching back to the shores.Addressing the fishermen as "brothers' throughout his talk, he said he wanted to get a sense of what many of them go through every day."I went to sea early in the morning with my brothers.From the moment the boat left the shore and till the moment it reached back the shore, every force was trying to fight my brothers," he said.Sharing his experience of sailing with the fishermen, Gandhi said they take the entire risk."They put their entire labour and fight the sea. They buy the net and somebody else gets the profit," he said.They threw the net and pulled it back out and there was one squid in it, he said."So the whole investment that was put into the boat, into the journey, the petrol within one minute, we saw there was no return.In my mind, I was expecting a net full of fish and the net came back empty. So I saw with my own eyes, your experience," Gandhi added.Highlighting hardships of fishermen, he said petrol and diesel prices go up every single day and the fishing community cannot buy an engine beyond a certain size.He said the fishermen told him that if they come one hour late, they don't get the same price they would get if they came one hour before.They also told him that they did not have any insurance."I have a sense of what you deal with. And now, when a fisherman comes to me to tell that they are struggling, I understand a little bit what they are going through.Of course I will never understand exactly your reality. I only pulled the net for one day. You do it everyday," Gandhi told the gathering."They cooked some fish on the boat. For the first time I realised, directly with my own eyes the difficulty to get the fish on the plate," he said amidst thunderous applause.Noting that he wanted to work with them to make their life easier, he also said he might not be able to resolve all their problems but he can certainly work with them and resolve as many as he can."Before I left the boat I asked the fishermen what their children do. They said their children do not want to be fishermen. Because it is too difficult and risky," Gandhi added.AICC general secretary K C Venugopal and T N Prathapan M P, also chairman of National Fishermen Congress, also accompanied him during his sea journey.Gandhi further said he would strive to have a separate ministry for fisheries at the Centre."So that the issues of fishing community can be defended and protected," he said adding that the UDF leaders in the state would soon hold discussions with the fisherfolk to prepare a separate manifesto for them during the impending assembly polls.Taking a dig at the LDF government apparently over the ongoing controversy related to the alleged deep sea fishing contract, the Congress leader said he would like to see what they were going to do with the trawlers."I am for competition...but not for unfair competition.So, there should be a level playing filed for everyone," he added.Gandhi's interaction with the fishermen assumes significance as the Congress-led UDF has raised allegations against the Left government in the state over an alleged deep sea fishing contract with a US-based company.In the wake of the controversy, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had directed the officials concerned to cancel the MoU between EMCC, the US-based firm and Kerala State Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC), a public sector undertaking and probe the circumstances under which it was signed.

24-02-2021||New Delhi||Human lives lost due to wildlife-human conflict need to be better compensated, say scientists||The lives of people lost due to wildlife-human conflicts are not adequately compensated in India, according to a new study which says changing the approach to this estimate can improve conservation efforts, and help understand which species to prioritise at conflict-prone zones.The research, published in the journal PNAS, surveyed 5,196 households living near 11 wildlife reserves in India, and self-reported annual costs including crop and livestock losses, injuries, and human deaths.“Human casualties contribute overwhelmingly to overall damages from wildlife interactions. This is despite the use of a relatively low valuation of human life from the literature,” study lead author, Sumeet Gulati from the Centre for Wildlife Studies in Bengaluru, told PTI.The researchers said compensation for human death ranges from Rs 76,400 in Haryana, to Rs 8,73,995 in Maharashtra.They said the average compensation paid for human death in the country is Rs 1,91,437, and the average compensation paid for injury is Rs 6,185.According to Gulati, these compensation values, known as value of a statistical life (VSL) are typically calculated from labour market comparisons.“Controlling for how productive workers are across different industries, economists estimate how much of the compensation paid can be attributed to the risk of injury or death across occupations,” he explained.According to the researchers, better compensation for human fatalities can likely reduce animosity towards the species conservationists intend to preserve.“More importantly, if governments invested in measures to reduce conflict based on an accurate understanding of the real value of the loss of human life, conflict would be reduced, and animosity would fall, making both those living near the forest and those who care about the beings in the forest better off,” Gulati explained.According to the wildlife conservationist, the dominance of the costs of human casualties rationalises the innate fear and respect towards large species like elephants displayed by those living with wildlife in India.Based on the findings, the scientists said focusing on the cost of human casualties while estimating losses from wildlife conflict is necessary.“Our research is one of the largest scientific assessments of human-wildlife conflict globally,” said study co-author Krithi Karanth from CWS.“We find that farmers experiencing a negative interaction with an elephant over the last year incur damages on average that are 600 and 900 times those incurred by farmers with negative interactions with the next most costly herbivore—the pig and the nilgai,” Karanth said.Similarly, she said farmers experiencing a negative interaction with a tiger over the last year incur damage that is on average three times that inflicted by a leopard, and a 100 times from a wolf.Although a species is associated with a rare occurrence of human fatalities, the scientists said the expected cost of death from a negative interaction could be much higher than the expected cost of frequently occurring crop or livestock damage.“Conservation managers have to prioritise human casualties and improve assistance provided to people,” Karanth added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/human-lives-lost-due-to-wildlife-human-conflict-need-to-be-better-compensated-say-scientists-216926

Some questions were asked and if need be she will be called again. The probe is on in the case related to the web series, Deputy Commissioner of Police Somen Barma had said.The Allahabad High Court had earlier this month ordered no coercive action be taken against Purohit in the case.In January, an FIR was lodged at the police station against Purohit, series director Ali Abbas, producer Himanshu Krishna Mehra, writer Gaurav Solanki, and an unidentified person.The nine-episode political thriller starring Bollywood A-listers Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia and Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub, started streaming on the platform in January.In Uttar Pradesh, FIRs have been registered against the show in Greater Noida and Shahjahanpur also, besides Lucknow.

24-02-2021||New Delhi||HC allows home quarantine for COVID-19 negative family after returning from UK||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday directed that the family of four, sent to seven-day institutional quarantine after returning from the UK despite testing negative for COVID-19, be sent to home quarantine for seven days saying the central and Delhi governments' guidelines on the issue were contradictory.Justice Prathiba M Singh issued the direction saying there was "no clarity" in the notifications which were "contradictory" regarding quarantine of passengers coming from the UK and directed the Delhi government to instruct the IGI airport to prominently display on its website the standard operating procedures (SOP) so that no confusion is caused to travellers.The direction was issued in view of contradictions in the stand of the Delhi government and the Centre.The central government said its guidelines only mandate 14-days home quarantine for travellers from the UK if they test negative and institutional quarantine is not advised.The Delhi government however said there was a January 29 central government SOP which stated that all passengers sitting close to a traveller who tested positive for COVID-19 have to be sent to institutional quarantine.The court said, "All these notifications are contradictory and there is no clarity as to which are applicable. There is no clarity whether the January 29 SOP continues to be in operation in view of the stand of the central government."Since there is no clarity about the SOP and the petitioners (family) include two minor children below the age of 10 years, they shall remain in home quarantine instead of institutional quarantine. They shall strictly adhere to the quarantine norms." The court also directed the Delhi government to "give clear instructions to the IGI airport to display the current SOP prominently on its website, so that travellers are aware and there is no confusion." With the direction, the court disposed of the plea by the family challenging the action taken against them.Advocate Ganesh Chand Sharma, appearing for the family, had on Tuesday told the court that all the members were tested for COVID-19 when they arrived here from the UK on February 20 and despite testing negative they were "illegally and unlawfully" sent to institutional quarantine.He had also told the court that according to the guidelines published on the Delhi airport website, institutional quarantine was not mandatory for all the passengers arriving from the UK and was applicable only to those who tested positive for COVID-19.The guidelines also exempted from institutional quarantine those travelling with minors below the age of 10 years, Sharma told the court.The petition had said that before starting from the UK, the family had undergone a COVID-19 test and they were issued a 'fit-to-fly' certificate.After arriving at Delhi, they were again tested and were found negative for COVID-19, despite which they were sent to institutional quarantine at their cost in a 5-star hotel instead of home quarantine as sought by the petitioners.

Besides, another team led by a Dy SP with five policemen is present in Lucknow’s SPM Civil Hospital where she is undergoing treatment for 72 per cent burns. Earlier reports said she suffered 60 per cent burns.After recording the girl’s statement in Lucknow, the investigating officer will take up the matter, the SP said.Over a dozen students of the college, including her friends, have been questioned.The girl had called one person of her village on mobile phone on the day of incident and he has also been questioned, the SP said.According to Asif Ali, a resident of the village where she was found lying without clothes, the villagers had covered her with a stole before calling the police.The SP said that in the field where she was lying, some tumblers were found but there was no trace of liquor.The girl from a village in the Jalalabad police station area studies in Swami Shukdevanand Postgraduate College, run by Mumukshu Ashram of Chinmayanand.The Ashram was in the centre of a controversy in 2019 after a female student of a law college run by it accused Chinmayanand of sexual assault. However, the student later withdrew her charges against Chinmayanand, who was arrested in the case in September 2019 and released on bail nearly five months later. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttar-pradesh-set-on-fire-after-failed-gang-rape-attempt-says-student-216907

24-02-2021||New Delhi||More Indians turn entrepreneurs as job market still bleak||While the job market still looks bleak in India after a pandemic-hit 2020, the world’s professional network LinkedIn said on Wednesday it has seen a 10 per cent growth in members with the title ‘founders’ or ‘co-founder’ on their profiles on the platform.Entrepreneurship looked up for Indian professionals last year.“This uptick in new entrepreneurs was particularly strong in the fields of mental healthcare, e-learning and online media,” according to the latest LinkedIn ‘Workforce Confidence Index’.“Skills are expected to become the new professional ‘currency’ this year as workers from different generations rely on learning new skills to future-proof their careers, at a time when industries continue to strengthen their remote operations,” said Ashutosh Gupta, India Country Manager, LinkedIn.“Reimagining employee skills and roles to welcome the post-pandemic ways of working will be crucial to building resilience for companies across sectors,” Gupta added.Based on the survey responses of 1,752 professionals, findings from January 1-29 revealed that professionals in India are confident about career progress despite growing uncertainties about the job market and financial future in the current environment.Nearly 80 per cent of professionals are confident about skilling opportunities, while 79 per cent are confident about the strength of their CVs.However, the survey showed a dip in India’s overall confidence.The survey attributes this dip in optimism to the workforce’s growing concerns about the status of the pandemic, surmounting expenses, and job availability in the present economic climate.This professional uncertainty comes right after the year-end holiday season, when India’s hiring rate dropped to 17 per cent year-over-year in December 2020, according to the latest edition of LinkedIn’s Labour Market update.The survey showed that while India remains resilient, professionals from different generations have contrasting reasons to stay confident in these testing times.While 92 per cent of Gen X and 98 per cent of Baby Boomers say the strength of their work experience and academic qualifications makes them more confident, 86 per cent of millennials state they are more inspired by opportunities to grow their skills and climb the ladder.Further, 80 per cent of Gen Z professionals said that the likelihood of progressing their careers makes them more confident today, said the survey.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/more-indians-turn-entrepreneurs-as-job-market-still-bleak-216896
24-02-2021||New Delhi||Punjab 'shamelessly' protecting gangster Mukhtar Ansari, UP govt tells SC||The Punjab government is “shamelessly” protecting gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, lodged in Rupnagar district jail in connection with an alleged extortion case, by not sending him to Uttar Pradesh to face trial in several cases, the UP government told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy however took note of the submission of senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the Punjab government, seeking adjournment in the matter on personal grounds.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Uttar Pradesh government, said he has no objection to Dave’s plea for adjournment.The top court has posted the matter for hearing on March 2.During the hearing, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Ansari, said that he (Ansari) was “small fry” being cornered by the “might of the state”.To this, Mehta said, “You (Ansari) are such a small fry that a state (Punjab) is shamelessly protecting you.”          Ansari is lodged in district jail Rupnagar in Punjab since January 2019.The UP government also filed written submissions in the top court stating that transfer of Ansari’s custody was meticulously planned and raised a strong suspicion of conspiracy to delay the proceedings before the Special Judge (MP/MLA), Allahabad.The state government said it has “locus standi” to seek transfer of case pending before Judicial Magistrate Mohali, to the court of Special Judge (MP/MLA) Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, as UP is “party interested” under Section 406 of Code of Criminal Procedure (Power of Supreme Court to transfer cases and appeals).“There is no specific provision for transfer of an under trial prisoner under Code of Criminal Procedure or Jail Manual still this Court can pass an order of transfer of Respondent No. 3 (Ansari) to District Jail Banda, Uttar Pradesh considering the facts situation of the present matter by exercising jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India,” the UP government said.It said Ansari’s fallacious plea that he does not want to come to the state as his life is under threat, is contrary to the plea of Punjab which contends that the accused is unable to travel due to medical reasons.The conduct of Punjab is evident from the fact that neither Ansari has applied for default bail in past two years nor the Punjab police have filed the charge sheet even after two years of lodging the accused in jail, the UP government said.“It is further appalling that Mukhtar Ansari has been operating his illegal activities in the state of Uttar Pradesh from within the jail maintained by the State of Punjab,” it said.“The transfer of Respondent No.3 (Ansari) is imperative from District Jail Roopnagar, State of Punjab to District Jail Banda, Uttar Pradesh and the appearance securing through video conferencing would not serve the purpose in view of the fact that the attendance could not be secured at several occasions in past, as a result the Special Judge (MP/MLA) Allahabad is not able to complete the trial expeditiously,” the UP government said.It also told the apex court that contention of Ansari that he has risk to his life is unsustainable and cannot be a ground for not handing over his custody.“Ansari had been safely lodged in the Banda Jail in Uttar Pradesh for 15 years duly protected by the Jail authorities and given full medical and health care. The State of Uttar Pradesh is duty bound to provide all safety and protection to accused and as such the alleged fear of Ansari is imaginary, ill founded and deserves to be rejected,” it said.The apex court was hearing a plea filed by Uttar Pradesh seeking a direction to the Punjab government and Rupnagar jail authority to immediately hand over the custody of Ansari to district jail Banda.It has also sought a direction to transfer the criminal proceedings and trial in the extortion case in Punjab to the special court in Allahabad.In its affidavit filed in the apex court, Punjab had referred to the medical condition of Ansari and said that he had been undergoing treatment at jail hospital as well as other hospitals from time to time since January 2019.While referring to the medical condition and advice of doctors, it has said that custody of Ansari “could not be handed over to the state of Uttar Pradesh due to the specific advice of the medical officers/medical board /specialists” from time to time.

After coming out of the meeting, she again walked to her vehicle.BJP officials told IANS, "Madam (Raje) always parks her vehicle on the porch irrespective of the fact who the party president was. Even last time, when she came to the party office, Poonia's vehicle was removed and her vehicle was parked on the porch. This is just opposite to the practice followed in the BJP national office where irrespective of the fact who is coming to the office, it is the party president's vehicle which is parked in the premises." Meanwhile, Arun Singh, Rajasthan in-charge addressed the press conference soon after the meeting.When asked about Raje's proposed 'power yatra' which she is reportedly starting from Bharatpur on her birthday March 8, he expressed his ignorance but quipped, "Religious yatras are being taken out by saints and am unaware about this yatra," he added.It needs to be mentioned here that Raje has been keeping a distance from party office since the last six months.BJP officials said that she was unhappy for being sidelined ever since the new BJP team was floated in the state.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parking-becomes-a-prestige-issue-at-rajasthan-bjp-headquarters-216882

24-02-2021||Washington||US senators asked to draft legislative package to 'outcompete' China, invest in alliances like India||US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has asked his Democratic colleagues to draft a legislative package to “outcompete” China, create new American jobs and invest in strategic partners and alliances like NATO and India.On a caucus call on Tuesday, Schumer discussed his push to direct Senate committees to draft a legislation to protect American jobs and outcompete China.He said his intention is to put the legislation on the Senate floor for a vote this spring.“Today, I directed the chairs and members of our relevant committees to start drafting a legislative package to outcompete China and create new American jobs,” Schumer said.The new legislation, he said, must achieve three goals. They should enhance American competitiveness with China by investing in US innovation, American workers and American manufacturing; invest in strategic partners and alliances: NATO, Southeast Asia and India; and expose, curb, and end once and for all China's predatory practices which have hurt so many American jobs, Schumer said.The legislation will have as its centrepiece a bicameral, bipartisan bill, the Endless Frontiers Act, which Schumer introduced last year with Senator Todd Young, Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna and Senator Mike Gallagh in the House.“It will take the key cutting industries and make American investments so we will outcompete China in all of them. In addition, we will make serious investments in strengthening the US semiconductor industry to outcompete China and stop depending on foreign sources,” Schumer said.He said at present semiconductor manufacturing is a dangerous weak spot in US economy and national security and that has to change.“You've all seen that auto plants throughout America are closed because they can't get the chips. We cannot rely on foreign processors for the chips. We cannot let China get ahead of us in chip production. This will be part of the proposal that we will introduce,” Schumer said.“We will also talk about the build out of 5G and how America can remain number one there. And all of these have bipartisan support. The bill we will intend to introduce...will be bipartisan. Our intention is to put this legislation on the Senate floor for a vote this spring,” he said.This month alone, nearly 20 anti-China legislations have been tabled or reintroduced in either chambers of the US Congress.

The UK and Canada are said to be mulling similar provisions.In Australia, the Bill goes back to last year when the country’s competition commission proposed a draft law making Google and Facebook pay for news content hosted on their search engines and pages.The Bill was later tabled in Australia’s Parliament with Facebook last week retaliating with a ban on Australian users from posting news links on its pages. The Australian law is widely seen as rooted in the ongoing news revenue war between the American internet giants and Australian media moghul Rupert Murdoch.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/deal-struck-facebook-agrees-to-restore-news-content-in-oz-216740

There should be a clear realisation, including in bodies dealing with human rights, that terrorism can never be justified, nor its perpetrators equated with its victims. — S Jaishankar, EAMHigh Commissioner of UN Human Rights office Michele Bachelet had been critical of the lockdowns and Internet shutdowns in Kashmir as also the application of force against anti-CAA and farmer protests.A torture victim and former Chilean President, Bachelet’s comments have been on various occasions dismissed by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) as ill-informed.Jaishankar said human rights issues were best pursued through dialogue, consultation and cooperation among states as well as technical assistance and capacity building. The MEA has also, in the past, raised the absence of dialogue by Bachelet which, it says, has led to half-baked observations.“Our approach to the UN Human Rights Council is guided by our spirit of engagement, dialogue and consultation,” Jaishankar said.The minister pressed this point by stating that violation of and gaps in the implementation of human rights should be addressed with objectivity, transparency and with due respect to the principles of non-interference in internal affairs and national sovereignty.But it is terrorism that violates the most fundamental human right — “the right to life”. “There should be a clear realisation, including in bodies dealing with human rights, that terrorism can never be justified, nor its perpetrators equated with its victims,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/terror-gravest-threat-to-rights-agenda-eam-216742

The polls were held on February 21. The main opposition Congress got a drubbing, winning only 55 seats and failed even to open account in Surat. On the other hand, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) put up an impressive show by winning 27 seats, all in Surat, and emerged as the main Opposition in the Surat Municipal Corporation. The AAP had for the first time fielded 470 candidates across all the six corporations.The BJP won 159 of 192 seats in Ahmedabad, 68 of 72 in Rajkot, 50 of 64 in Jamnagar, 44 of 52 seats in Bhavnagar, 69 of 76 in Vadodara and 93 of the 120 seats in Surat.The Congress won 25 seats in Ahmedabad, four in Rajkot, 11 in Jamnagar, eight in Bhavnagar and seven in Vadodara.Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM, which also contested local body polls in Gujarat for the first time, won seven seats in Ahmedabad’s Muslim-dominated Jamalpur and Maktampura wards. The BJP had won 389 seats and Congress 176 across these municipal corporations in 2016.Top BJP leaders, including PM Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and party chief JP Nadda, hailed the people of Gujarat and their cadres for the victory.With the Assembly elections due next year, the polls are being seen as indicator of the voters’ mood. In a series of tweets, the PM thanked Gujarat for showing “unwavering faith towards politics of development and good governance”. Coming amid the ongoing farmers’ agitation, the BJP is viewing the results as an endorsement of the three controversial laws, especially after the drubbing it received in the Punjab local body polls.Nadda attributed the “historic win” to the “complete faith” of all sections, including villages, poor, farmers, traders, women and youth in PM Modi.

For traditional and Hindu voters there is always Sabarimala. Yogi Adityanath appeared to be the part of its tested and tried strategy to reach out to Hindu voters and those in favour of the Sabarimala traditions.So far as Usha is concerned, the BJP has been in touch with her since long.In 2016, she was designated the chairperson of the organising committee of the BJP’s national executive meet, raising eyebrows in political and sporting circles, though she insisted there was “no politics” involved in it. In 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a synthetic track at the Usha School of Athletics. Recently she supported the BJP over farm laws and, also condemned climate change activist Greta Thunberg and singer Rihanna for “interfering” in India’s internal matters.Usha is expected to join during the 'yatra' which will culminate around the first week of March.

A citizen has the fundamental rights to use the best means of imparting and receiving communication, as long as the same is permissible under the four corners of law and as such have access to audience abroad,” the court said.It said that creation of a WhatsApp group or being editor of an innocuous Toolkit is not an offence. “Further, since the link with the said toolkit or PJF has not been found to be objectionable, mere deletion of the WhatsApp chat to destroy the evidence linking her with the toolkit and PJF, also becomes meaningless,” the court said.While observing that there is nothing on record to suggest that the applicant accused subscribed to any secessionist idea, the court said “further, the prosecution has, except for pointing out that applicant/accused forwarded the toolkit to climate activist Greta Thunberg, failed to point out as to how the applicant/accused gave global audience to the ‘secessionist elements’.”  The court said it was conscious of the fact that it is very difficult to   collect evidence for the offence of conspiracy. “I’m also conscious of the fact that the investigation is at a nascent stage and police is in the process of collecting more evidence, however, the investigating agency made a conscious choice to arrest the applicant accused upon the strength of material so far collected and now they cannot be permitted to further restrict the liberty of a citizen on the basis of propitious anticipations,” the court said.It said conspiracy cannot be proved merely on the basis of inferences which have to be backed by evidence. While holding that there is nothing on record to establish any direct link between Ravi and pro­-Khalistan activists of PJF, the court said “Still further, there is nothing on record to suggest that there was any call, incitement, instigation or exhortation on the part of the applicant/accused and the abovesaid organisations and its associates to foment violence on Janury 26, 2021.”As long as the engagement/interaction remains within the four corners of law, people interacting with such persons, ignorantly, innocently or for that matter even fully conscious of their dubious credentials, cannot be painted with the same hue, it said.“In the absence of any evidence to the effect that the applicant/accused agreed or shared a common purpose to cause violence on Janury 26, 2021 with the founders of PJF, it cannot be presumed by resorting to surmises or conjectures that she also supported the secessionist tendencies or the violence caused on Janury 26 simply because she shared a platform with people, who have gathered to oppose the legislation.The court directed that Ravi shall continue to cooperate with the ongoing investigations and shall join the investigation as and when summoned by the Investigating officer and not leave the country without the permission of the court. The court noted that more than hundreds of persons involved in the violence have been arrested and interrogated by the Delhi Police but no evidence connecting the accused with the actual perpetrators of the violence has been brought forth on record by the prosecution till date.
