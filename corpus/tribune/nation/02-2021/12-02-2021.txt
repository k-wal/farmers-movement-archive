I appeal to the judiciary to please be a little more objective while admitting PILs and take a view of the circumstances under which a PIL can be filed,” said Prasad, replying to a debate in the Lok Sabha before the passage of the Bill replacing The Arbitration Council Amendment Ordinance 2020 which seeks to make India a hub of arbitration besides welcoming arbitrators of any nationality.The Law Minister said he had personally argued several landmark cases and PILs that led to “tectonic shifts."“I was the lawyer in the fodder scam, the bitumen scam; I was the lawyer for Ram Lalla and for LK Advani. Tectonic shifts took place when such matters were argued. But these days, PILs are filed on the basis of news headlines. I appeal to courts that genuine PILs on workers’ rights, environmental issues must be accepted but to look at the load the PILs are adding to litigation,” Prasad said.He also used the occasion to say that “the separation of powers is as much a basic structure of the Constitution as the independence of the judiciary.”“Governance should be left to those elected to govern and accountable to the Parliament and law making should be left to legislators,” the Law Minister said.Earlier, speaking on the Bill on arbitration, Prasad said India will not tolerate award of contracts motivated by corruption and noted that the Bill on arbitration provides an architecture for creation of a world class arbitration structure."If we have a credible arbitration architecture, the world will come to us. We intend to make India a hub of arbitration and this Bill gives the Arbitration Council of India full autonomy to select arbitrators, notwithstanding their nationality," the minister said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/urge-courts-to-see-merits-while-admitting-pils-law-minister-prasad-211478
12-02-2021||Dehradun/New Delhi||Uttarakhand flood: Lake formed due to blocking of stream joining Rishi Ganga, says report||The debris brought by the avalanche in Uttarakhand earlier this week has blocked a stream that joins the Rishi Ganga river forming a temporary lake which if breached can cause further damage in the valley, said a report by the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology.Also read: Hopes fade as rescuers struggle to find 35 men trapped in tunnelAccording to its director Kalachand Sain, a team of scientists from the institute conducted an aerial survey of the upper reaches of the Rishi Ganga just a day after the Sunday avalanche and spotted the new glacial lake there.The team took some photographs of the lake taken from a helicopter. It seems that the recent avalanche has led to its formation in the higher stretches of the Rishi Ganga’s catchment area, he said.“Our scientists are examining the size of the lake, its periphery and the volume of water it contains to ascertain how big and immediate the danger from it is,” Sain told PTI.According to the report by the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG), an organisation of the Department of Science and Technology, the assessment of the actual magnitude of risk involved due to this impoundment of water requires a detailed survey.“The catastrophic floods on Sunday also brought sediments in the Rishi Ganga river. Since the width of the river is very less in the upper stretches, the sediments have blocked a stream forming a lake which may breach and cause further damage in the valley,” Sain said.A portion of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district on Sunday, triggering an avalanche and a deluge in the Alaknanda river system that washed away hydroelectric stations and endangered lives of people living along the banks.According to WIHG, a mass of rock weakened over a period of time due to freezing and thawing of snow must have led to the creation of a “weak zone” triggering its collapse, which brought down sediments. The avalanche was also accompanied by a thick pack of snow and ice that overlaid the rock surface, it stated.This resulted in the formation of a temporary dam that eventually breached, causing the deadly floods in Chamoli district on Sunday.The incident occurred adjacent to the Raunthi glacier. The area also has glaciers that feed the Rishi Ganga river, which ultimately joins the Dhauli Ganga.The steep slopes of the mountains in the region further increased the intensity of the crash. The stretch of the avalanche was about three kilometres with an average slope of 37 degrees, before reaching the “Raunthi Nala/Gadhera” floor at an altitude of about 3,600 metres.Meanwhile, Chamoli District Magistrate Swati S Bhadauria said an eight-member team of the scientists of the Geological Survey of India has been formed to inspect the lake and submit its report to the district administration at the earliest. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-flood-lake-formed-due-to-blocking-of-stream-joining-rishi-ganga-says-report-211472
12-02-2021||---||40 lakh tractors to be connected with farmers’ protest: Tikait||Jhajjar, February 12Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait on Friday said farmers’ next target was to connect 40 lakh tractors with the ongoing agitation and to organise ‘kisan panchayats’ across the nation for mobilising more people in support of their demand for the repeal of three farm laws.Tikait also revealed plans by farmer leaders to hold meetings in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state Gujarat and said protesters in Delhi would not return home until the Centre reaches an “agreement” with them.He called upon protesting farmers to be ready for a “foot march” stating that the Centre would have to accept their demands.Tikait was addressing a gathering at ‘Sarva Jatiya Kisan Majdoor Panchayat’ organised by Dalal Khap-84 at the Bahadurgarh-Tikri border here on Friday. Other farmer leaders, including Gurnam Singh Charuni, also attended the panchayat.“Kisan mahapanchayats being organised these days are working to connect the people with the farmers’ agitation hence such panchayats will now be organised across the nation to garner more support from other states. Farmers will march towards Delhi if needed,” said Tikait who also held the government responsible for the Delhi violence during the Republic Day Parade on January 26.He called upon the farmers to write ‘Kisan Karanti Yatra 26 January 2021’ on their tractor-trailers to spread the message that they would not go back to their home without getting the farm laws repealed.“This agitation will continue until the Government of India talks to the committee and arrives at an agreement. Till that time, farmers will not return home,” he said.Tikait alleged that farmers from Gujarat were being pressured not to lend support to the agitation.“If anyone from Gujarat wants to come here to support the agitation and if it is found they are coming, police are being sent to their homes,” Tikait alleged.“We will hold meetings in Gujarat and other states,” he said.Tikait also said the “business on hunger” will not be allowed and those wanting it will be “driven out” of the country.Hitting out at the farm laws, he claimed these would lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) and exploitation of farmers, from whom big companies will procure their produce at cheaper rates and then store it in godowns.Big godowns will be built, which will be barricaded on similar lines like the ones near the protest sites at the Delhi borders, he said.Without naming anyone, he said attempts had been made to divide the farmers' stir."They tried to divide us on the lines of Punjab and Haryana, then small and big farmers.“We have said that the three laws are not acceptable to farmers and should be rolled back. But how will they take back these when godowns were built first and laws were framed later.“They did business of temple, religion and feelings. Now, they want to do the business on hunger,” Tikait alleged.Charuni said protesting farmers would win the ongoing agitation in every situation as they were fighting for justified demands hence the agitation would go on until the demands were met. He demanded there should be the guarantee of procuring the produce at minimum support price (MSP) while a provision of punishment should be made if the produce was procured at a price less than the MSP.Charuni said they were working to identify anti-social elements who were trying to infiltrate the agitation in order to spoil it and firm arrangements were being made to prevent their entry.

12-02-2021||New Delhi||Inter-caste marriages will possibly reduce caste and community tensions: SC||Inter-caste marriages will possibly reduce caste and community tensions, the Supreme Court has said while noting that the educated younger boys and girls are now-a-days choosing their life partners, which is a departure from earlier societal norms.                 The top court said that youngsters face threats from the elders and the courts have been coming to the aid of these youngsters. It said the way forward to the police authorities is to counsel the Investigating Officers (IO) and lay down some guidelines and training programmes on how to handle such socially sensitive cases.The remarks came by a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy, which quashed an FIR lodged by the parents of the girl, who had married a boy of her choice against the wishes of elders, at Belgavai district of Karnataka.The top court in its recent verdict said that it hopes that the parents of the girl will have a better sense to accept the marriage and re-establish social interaction not only with her but even with her husband.“That, in our view, is the only way forward. Under the garb of caste and community to alienate the child and the son-in-law will hardly be a desirable social exercise,” the bench told the parents of the girl, who has sought quashing of the FIR lodged against her.The top court said, “Educated younger boys and girls are choosing their life partners which, in turn, is a departure from the earlier norms of society where caste and community play a major role. Possibly, this is the way forward where caste and community tensions will reduce by such inter marriage but in the meantime these youngsters face threats from the elders and the Courts have been coming to the aid of these youngsters”.         Referring to earlier verdicts of the top courts, the bench said it has been held that the consent of the family or the community or the clan is not necessary once the two adult individuals agree to enter into wedlock and that their consent has to be piously given primacy.The bench said it has been held in the 2017 verdict of the top court that the choice of an individual is an “inextricable part of dignity, for dignity cannot be thought of where there is erosion of choice”. “Intimacies of marriage lie within a core zone of privacy, which is inviolable and even matters of faith would have the least effect on them. The right to marry a person of choice was held to be integral to Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” the bench noted, while referring to Hadiya case verdict of 2018.Justice Kaul, who penned down the verdict on behalf of the bench, said that the intervention of this court would really not have been required in the given facts of the case, if the investigating officer had conducted himself more responsibly in closing the complaint.“If the investigating officer really wanted to record the statement of the petitioner No.1 (girl), should have informed that he would visit her and recorded the statement instead of putting her under threat of action against petitioner No.2 (boy) to come to the police station,” the bench said.The bench said that it does not reflect very well on the police authorities or the IO of the case as the marriage certificate having been received by him and the conversation already been held with the girl, where she clearly stated that she was married to the boy, and that she was feeling threatened and apprehensive of coming to the police station.        “If the IO could have visited the residence of petitioner No.2 (boy), he could very well have recorded the statement of petitioner No.1(girl) at the place where the petitioners were residing rather than insisting and calling upon the petitioners to come to the local police station at Karnataka”, it said.The bench said that the IO undoubtedly sought to compel the girl to come and record the statement at police station on the threat of possibility of a false case being registered by her parents against the boy and the consequent action of the police which would result in his arrest.“We strongly deprecate the conduct of the IO in adopting these tactics and the officer must be sent for counselling as to how to manage such cases,” the bench said.It said that the way forward to the police authorities is to not only counsel the current IOs but devise a training programme to deal with such cases for the benefit of the police personnel.“We expect the police authorities to take action on this behalf in the next eight weeks to lay down some guidelines and training programmes on how to handle such socially sensitive cases,” the bench said.The bench noted that both the petitioners are well educated and the boy is an M.Tech from NIT, Tiruchirapalli and got a placement as an Assistant Professor in Jain College of Engineering, Belagavi, while his wife is an MA B.Ed and was a Lecturer in a College.   It noted that there was resistance from the parents of the girl, though the parents of the boy were willing for the matrimony of both the well qualified petitioners who are majors and Hindu by religion. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/inter-caste-marriages-will-possibly-reduce-caste-and-community-tensions-sc-211463
12-02-2021||Chennai||H&M factory in India set to rehire hundreds of fired garment workers||More than 1,200 Indian garment workers who were fired by a H&M supplier in southern India during coronavirus lockdown last year are set to be rehired in a rare win for labour unions.Garment manufacturer Gokaldas Exports Limited has agreed to re-employ 1,257 workers - mostly women - who were laid off when it closed a factory near Mysuru in Karnataka state in June, said two Indian unions and global federation IndustriALL.The organisations said an agreement signed this month with Gokaldas - which has not yet been made public - would also allow the Garment and Textile Workers' Union (GATWU) to negotiate in any factory where at least 20 per cent of the workers were members.Gokaldas could not be reached for comment. On its website, the company says it is India's largest manufacturer and exporter of clothing, and hires more than 25,000 people at 20 factories.Swedish retailer H&M - Gokaldas' biggest buyer - said it was "positive that an agreement has finally been reached" but could not give further details as it was not a signatory to the pact.Jayaram K Ramaiah, legal advisor for Bangalore-based GATWU, said the agreement could set an example for other manufacturers."This is not just any win for workers, it is historic," he said, praising the workers for protesting for several weeks."We want to take this beyond the present victory ... to create a model factory and a harassment-free environment for all workers," Ramaiah told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone."This is just the beginning."Under the agreement, the laid-off workers will be rehired in other Gokaldas factories by August, according to the unions.India's multi-million-dollar garment industry, which employs at least 12 million people, has faced scrutiny for labour rights abuses and advocates fear the COVID-19 pandemic could put more pressure on suppliers and lead to greater worker exploitation.Union-BustingThe Gokaldas factory in question was the only one among more than 20 facilities which was unionised, IndustriALL said.Gokaldas said in June that H&M order cancellations led to the factory's closure yet the brand denied this and stated that it had paid for all products as agreed, according to the union, which criticised the Indian manufacturer for "union-busting".In several garment-producing countries - from India to Cambodia and Myanmar - activists say factory bosses have used the economic fallout from the pandemic as an excuse to target and fire union members while keeping on non-unionised workers.In response to questions about the Gokaldas factory, a spokeswoman for H&M said the retailer would continue to strengthen freedom of association in its supply chain."We recognise there is a continuous need to address these issues," she said.The lay-offs were illegal under Indian federal labour law because Gokaldas' management had not engaged with the state government before closing the factory, according to a report in December by the Alternative Law Forum - a legal research group.Hundreds of workers at the factory protested for about 50 days after the mass firing, and continued to do so despite threats from bosses at Gokaldas, the three unions said.One of them, 50-year-old Padma - a GATWU member who had worked at the factory for a decade - described the protests as "very tough ... the most difficult I have ever been part of"."But now that our union is being recognised, I hope any future issues will be settled faster and through talks," the widow and mother of two - who only uses one name - said by phone. "It should not have to take such a long protest again." Thomson Reuters Foundation||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hm-factory-in-india-set-to-rehire-hundreds-of-fired-garment-workers-211460

The girl was raped by several people between November 1995 and May 1996.She was allegedly lured into the trap by a person with a job offer.

12-02-2021||Bharuch||Gujarat local polls: BJP fields 31 Muslim candidates in Bharuch||The BJP has given tickets to as many as 31 Muslim candidates in Bharuch district for February 28 elections to local bodies in Gujarat.According to Marutisinh Atodariya, district BJP chief, this is for the first time that the party has fielded so many candidates from the Muslim community in the district.But he denied that this has anything to do with a rival alliance between the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) and Asaduddin Owaisi’s All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen.Bharuch district, with a sizable number of Muslim voters, will see elections to the district panchayat, nine taluka (tehsil) panchayats and four municipalities.“Of total 320 candidates declared by the BJP parliamentary board on Wednesday for the district, 31 are Muslim, the highest ever in Bharuch so far,” Atodariya said.Some candidates may be replaced if their nominations get rejected by the election authorities, he added.Bharuch district panchayat, which has 34 seats, was ruled by the Congress and Jhaghadia MLA Chhotu Vasava’s BTP which was formed following a split in the JD(U).Recently, Vasava announced poll alliance with AIMIM and also held a joint rally with Owaisi last week.But Atodariya denied that this alliance prompted the saffron party to pick more Muslim candidates.“We have not selected candidates just because they belong to a minority community. They were selected on merit.For instance, we have selected a Muslim BJP worker for Valia seat in district panchayat where Hindus are in majority,” he said.The BJP’s acceptability among Muslims has increased and many of them have joined the party, he claimed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-local-polls-bjp-fields-31-muslim-candidates-in-bharuch-211427

His wife Durgawati was arrested on December 28.The arrests were made by a dedicated unit of the CBI specialising in the probe into cases of online sexual abuse and exploitation of children.The arrested junior engineer, a resident of Chitrakoot district, is alleged to have victimised about 50 children in the age group of five to 16 years in Chitrakoot, Banda and Hamirpur districts.During searches, the CBI had recovered eight mobile phones, around Rs 8 lakh in cash, sex toys, laptops and other digital evidence carrying a huge amount of child sexual abuse material, agency officials had said earlier.The junior engineer had allegedly been indulging in the crime for the past 10 years, mainly contacting and sharing the sexual abuse material with other paedophiles globally using the darknet and cloud services abroad, they said.He is also alleged to have told investigators that he used to bribe children with mobile phones and other electronic gadgets to keep their mouth shut about his activities. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sexual-abuse-of-children-chargesheet-filed-against-accused-211425

The three-member committee is holding consultations with stakeholders, both online and in person.In a statement, the committee said it held its interactions through video conference with farmers, farmer unions and farmer producer organisations (FPOs).Twelve farm unions and farmers from Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal participated in the detailed deliberations with the committee members, it said.“All the participating farmer unions, FPOs and farmers gave their detailed views and suggestions on the three farm laws,” the committee added.On January 12, the apex court had stayed the implementation of the three contentious farm laws for two months and asked the committee to submit a report within two months after consulting the stakeholders.Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders for over two months seeking repeal of the new legislations, introduced by the Centre last year, saying they are pro-corporate and can weaken the mandi system.The 11 rounds of talks between the Centre and 41 protesting farmer unions have so far remained deadlocked, even though the ruling dispensation has offered concessions, including suspension of the legislations for 18 months, which the unions have rejected.—  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-laws-sc-appointed-panel-holds-consultations-with-12-farmer-unions-from-8-states-211420

12-02-2021||New Delhi||Twitter blocks 97 pc of accounts, posts flagged by IT Ministry||Twitter has blocked over 97 per cent of the accounts and posts flagged by the IT Ministry for provocative content and misinformation around farmers' protest, sources said.This followed a meeting between Twitter representatives and the Information Technology Secretary on Wednesday evening where the US-based microblogging platform was issued a stern warning to comply with local laws or be prepared for action.The Ministry had questioned Twitter's delay in taking action on its order to block provocative content that could impact public law and order, whereas the American company had been quick to crack down when a similar instance occurred at US Capitol Hill.According to the sources, Twitter has now complied with the orders and over 97 per cent of the accounts flagged have been blocked.Twitter did not respond to queries on the matter.On February 4, Twitter was asked to take down 1,178 accounts with links to Pakistan and Khalistan supporters that were spreading misinformation and provocative content related to farmers' protest.Prior to that, the government had sought blocking of 257 tweets and handles in connection with the agitation by farmers over the new agricultural laws. Twitter had complied with the orders only to restore the accounts hours later.Twitter on Wednesday morning had said it has suspended over 500 accounts and blocked access to several others within India, but maintained that it would not block accounts of "news media entities, journalists, activists and politicians" as doing so "would violate their fundamental right to free expression" guaranteed under the country's law.It, however, yielded to the orders later after the crucial meeting on Wednesday evening.In a statement after the meeting, IT Ministry had stated that the microblogging platform had been asked to take strong action against "well-coordinated" campaigns "designed to create disharmony and unrest" in the country.Monique Meche, Twitter Vice President Global Public Policy and Jim Baker, Deputy General Counsel and Vice President Legal, had affirmed Twitter's commitment towards following Indian laws and rules.The executives had also requested for better engagement between the Indian government and the company's global team. Sources said Twitter's latest move to block the flagged accounts is itself a validation that the government's orders were backed by sound reasoning and logic.The government had made it clear that it will not negotiate with the platforms while insisting on compliance with its orders as it believed that a private commercial entity in India cannot unilaterally decide on public law and order, ignoring the democratic values of the country.IT Ministry was of the view that Twitter, being an intermediary, was required to take immediate action after receiving the government's notice to block handles, but did not move with haste to take down "atrocious" hashtags and "incendiary" content even amid a volatile situation.IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had recently emphasised that the government is all for freedom of speech and expression and that it remains investor-friendly, but disrespecting democratic values is not acceptable. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/twitter-blocks-97-pc-of-accounts-posts-flagged-by-it-ministry-211407

12-02-2021||New Delhi||BJP hits back at Rahul for his attack on PM, says Congress leader ‘lying left, right and centre’||Hitting back at Rahul Gandhi for his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the India-China border standoff, the BJP accused the Congress leader on Friday of “lying left, right and centre” and denigrating the country’s security forces, and said the “nation cannot forgive the Gandhi family for losing 43,000 sq kms of land to China”.“When one does not have a moral conscience, when one cannot contribute anything positive, one resorts to lies. Rahul lied left, right and centre. Perhaps Rahul is depressed that he could not become the PM. He knows that even his shadow won’t support him & can’t digest the huge public mandate to PM Narendra Modi,” Union Minister and BJP leader Pralhad Joshi said.It seems Rahul Gandhi is wasting his life thinking about old times. Revisiting the past and living in a bubble will not help the Congress scion.A few days ago he remembered tyrants in his party like Motilal and this time he went to the old guardian - Jawaharlal.  With Gandhi making his attack on Modi personal, Joshi alleged that the former Congress chief’s “utterances” were based on far-fetched presumptions and create “serious doubts on his mental health”.Perhaps Rahul is depressed that he could not become PM. He knows that even his shadow won't support him & can't digest the huge public mandate to PM @narendramodi ji.Given his utterances based on far-fetched presumptions, it creates serious doubts on his mental health.  “The selective amnesia which Rahul often displays seems a regular order. Denigrating efforts and sacrifices of our security forces, whom you are placating? Why? Because you got some donation for your party? Can’t forget your meeting with the Chinese?” he said in a social media post.The selective amnesia which Rahul often displays, seems a regular order.Denigrating efforts and sacrifices of our security forces, whom you are placating? Why? Because you got some donation for your party? Can’t forget your meeting with the Chinese?  Gandhi questioned the government on Friday over its agreement with China on disengagement of troops in eastern Ladakh and alleged that Modi has “ceded” Indian territory to the Chinese. He further alleged that the Prime Minister could not stand up to the neighbouring country.His attack on the government came a day after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh assured Parliament that India had not conceded anything in the sustained talks with China and it would not allow even an inch of its territory to be taken away by anyone.“Congress party breeds a culture of petty politics. Every member of the Gandhi family always leaves behind a legacy of misdeeds. History bears testimony to their repeated attacks on the sovereignty of the nation and unfortunately, it is the country that has to always suffer,” Joshi said.The nation could not forgive the Gandhi family for losing 43,000 square kilometres of land to China, he said, noting that Pakistan had also illegally ceded 5,180 square kilometres of Indian territory in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) to China.In a tweet, BJP general secretary CT Ravi said: “I am glad that the Congress has finally realised that PM Nehru created a ‘Himalayan Blunder’ by gifting 38,000 sq km land to China. Will it also question its co-owner, the coward Rahul Gandhi for making baseless allegations against PM Modi?” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-hits-back-at-rahul-for-his-attack-on-pm-says-congress-leader-lying-left-right-and-centre-211403
12-02-2021||Jaipur||PM threatens farmers but can’t stand up to China: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of trying to clear the path for his “friends” through the three new agri-marketing laws, saying he is threatening farmers when he cannot stand up to China.Addressing farmer “mahapanchayats” in Pilibanga town of Rajasthan’s Hanumangarh district, he claimed the laws will impact 40 per cent of Indians.He also referred to the India-China agreement on disengagement of troops in eastern Ladakh, alleging that the Modi government ceded territory between fingers 3 and 4 on the banks of Pangong lake.“He would not stand before China but threatens farmers. This is the reality of Narendra Modi,” Gandhi charged.He addressed another Congress-organised farmers’ meeting in Sri Ganganagar’s Padampur town on the first day of his two-day Rajasthan trip.Instead of chairs, cots were placed on the dais for party leaders to sit upon in Hanumangarh. In Sri Ganganagar, there were rustic “mudda” chairs on the dais.Gandhi said the new laws do not affect just the farmers, adding his party will ensure that they are withdrawn. Even the British couldn’t stand before farmers, he said.He said Modi should first withdraw the laws if he wants to talk to farmers.Forty perc ent of people in the country who include farmers, traders and labourers will be hit by the implementation of the laws, the Congress leader claimed.“They are not just farmers; they are traders, labourers, traders, adhatiyas (middlemen). This is the business of Bharat Mata that feeds the nation,” he said in Sri Ganganagar.“The objective of the laws is to shift the business of 40 percent people to two or three people. What will happen to those who sell grain, fruit and vegetables on roads if only one company starts selling grain, fruit or vegetables of the entire country?” he said.Gandhi said the new farm laws are another blow to the people of the country after demonetisation and the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).“Earlier, it was the demonetisation and I had said it was not a fight against black money, and the backbone of the country was being broken. But people didn’t understand this at that time,” Gandhi said.“After this, the GST was implemented, which was an attack on small and midsize businesses. Narendra Modi wants to clear the way for his friends,” Gandhi alleged, without naming anyone but apparently referring to big businesses.The Congress leader claimed that with the implementation of the new laws, government mandis will shut down and big businessmen will monopolise the purchase of farm produce.He claimed there will be hoarding.”If a single person wants to purchase the country’s entire grain, it can be done. What mandi system will remain then?” he said.“The first law is meant to finish the mandi system. The second law is about unlimited hoarding. It means one person can control prices,” he said.The third law is about snatching the right of farmers to seek justice, he claimed.“Narendra Modi says the laws were brought for farmers. But if this was so, why are the farmers disappointed and agitating and why 200 farmers died,” he asked.The Congress leader was referring to the thousands of farmers now camping at Delhi’s borders for weeks, demanding the repeal of the new laws.Several have died of various causes, including accidents and suicide in Punjab and Haryana during the protests. But the exact number is unverified.Farmer unions and opposition parties say the new laws will weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system through which farmers sell their crops in ‘mandis”. They claim that the system benefits private businesses.But the government says the laws give farmers the option to sell their produce anywhere, and they are still free to sell them at mandis at the MSP.AICC general secretaries Ajay Maken and K C Venugopal, state Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasra, former deputy CM Sachin Pilot and other party leaders attended the event.Gandhi referred to the call he made during his Lok Sabha speech yesterday for two minutes of silence as a mark of respect to farmers who died during the agitation. He said it is “shameful” that no BJP MP stood up for it. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-threatens-farmers-but-cant-stand-up-to-china-rahul-211401
12-02-2021||Chandigarh||Death while on duty during natural calamities entitled to enhanced pension: Armed Forces Tribunal||The Armed Forces Tribunal on Friday ruled that the next of kin of a soldier who dies while on duty for combating natural calamities is entitled to higher pensionary benefits than those applicable to death during routine service.Finally, bringing closure to the case of the widow of a soldier who lost his life while extinguishing a forest fire on the Indo-China border, the Tribunal has directed the Centre to grant her Liberalised Family Pension rather than the Special Family Pension that she was getting.Liberalised Family Pension is equivalent to the last drawn emoluments of the deceased, and is applicable in case where death occurs during operations or other specified field circumstances, whereas Special Family Pension is 60 per cent of the last drawn pay.Champa Devi’s husband, late Naik Surinder Kumar of the Punjab Regiment, was deployed near the China border in the northeast when he perished after he was called to assist in extinguishing a forest fire in aid of the authorities concerned.He died when a tree fell on him during the firefight. Though the Army had declared the death a “battle casualty” as per applicable provisions, the office of the Principal Controller of Defence Accounts (Pensions) at Allahabad had rejected her papers saying the death fell in the category of rules which dealt with organised sports and recreation.Setting aside the rejection order of the accounts branch, the Tribunal's Bench comprising Justice Mohammad Tahir and Vice Admiral HCS Bisht held that the death fell in the category of the rules that dealt with deaths arising out of duty during natural calamities, which entitled a widow to Liberalised Family Pension.The Army had opposed the plea by citing a judgment of the Supreme Court where a widow was refused Liberalised Family Pension on account of a heart attack and where the court had held that the claim was only sustainable if the death was in live action. The Tribunal, however, observed that in the said case only the category of rules dealing with live action had been commented upon in which a heart attack did not fall while this case involved an altogether different category of the rules which dealt with natural calamities.Legal experts also point out that in certain past cases the correct and latest government orders had not been disclosed by the official establishment even in the Supreme Court.For example, deaths occurring due to natural illnesses on the Line of Control, International Border and in Siachen also qualify for liberalised benefits and are supposed to be declared “Battle Casualties” as per rules but still benefits to such deaths are opposed in courts in many cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/death-while-on-duty-during-natural-calamities-entitled-to-enhanced-pension-armed-forces-tribunal-211394

It may continue till October,” Tikait told ANI.He said this in response to the statement of Samyukt Kisan Morcha leader Gurnam Singh Charni that the farmers’ protest would continue till October.Tikait had earlier said that the farmers’ agitation would not conclude unless the government repealed the three laws and that it might carry on till October.On Friday, he said the farmers protested at the Ghazipur border on October 2 every year.“Teargas shells and bullets were fired at the farmers on October 2, 2018, at the Ghazipur border. Every year, we have a programme here at the Ghazipur border and will also have it this year,” he said.Tikait said it is good that the issue is being debated in Parliament.He said there must be a genuine reason if the country’s farmers had been protesting for so long.

12-02-2021||New Delhi||Opposition parties slam govt over Union Budget, say nothing in it for common man||Opposition parties in the Rajya Sabha on Friday charged that the Union Budget serves the interests of capitalists that will help the rich turn richer and has nothing for the common man, even as the BJP defended saying it has earmarked funds for all including strengthening of health sector.Participating in the debate on the budget, leaders of parties like the Congress, the BSP, the AAP and the Left launched an all-out attack on the BJP government for allegedly selling off the country’s assets and PSUs to big industrialists.Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil alleged that the budget helped the rich capitalists and was asking the poor, the oppressed and the downtrodden to become ‘atmanirbhar’ (self sufficient).He alleged that the cess imposed by the government was an attempt by it to deprive the states of their share in taxes.He alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently quoted his predecessor Manmohan Singh and Sharad Pawar, selectively and out of context, on the issue of farm reforms, and recalled that he, as Gujarat chief minister, had recommended a law to ensure Minimum Support Price (MSP) to farmers.“The country is passing through a bad time owing to the decisions such as demonetisation and the GST. The government is helping and supporting the big people, and is asking the poor, the weaker and the downtrodden to become ‘artmanirbhar’,” Gohil alleged.BJP leader and Union Minister Anurag Thakur attacked Opposition parties, asking them not to use farmers for their political gains and asserted that the three new farm laws would help in doubling income of peasants.He challenged the Opposition leaders to show him if it was written anywhere in the three laws that the regime of mandis and MSP would come to an end due to the legislation.“We are committed to double the income of the farmers,” Thakur said.Bhupendra Yadav (BJP) lauded the government for providing over Rs 27.1 lakh crore, which is 13 per cent of GDP, under ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ in three financial packages.He also noted that the government was ready to talk to farmers on agri bills with an open heart and mind.On the issue of privatisation, he quoted former Prime Minister Charan Singh, who in his book had talked about loss-making PSUs due to mismanagement and corruption.Binoy Biswam (CPI) charged that in the name of ‘atmanirbhar’, this budget was clearly helping capitalists.“Is this the model of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ that you surrender everything to the capitalists. This government can be called a government of FDI for capitalists. Don’t try to cheat people, as it is time they understood this,” he alleged.Biswam alleged that the government was selling everything from air to sea to land and even underground and was “blindly following” the capitalist model.Former prime minister HD Deve Gowda (JDS) said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had provided for all that was required to deal with the pandemic in this budget.He was of the view that privatisation as not always good for all sectors as sometime it created private monopoly also.Ashok Siddharth (BSP) said there was nothing in this budget for the common man as it was trying to sell the country’s assets and PSUs.“This government wants the rich to turn richer and the poor poorer,” he charged, adding that it was not fair to give away the rights of poor, Dalits to industrialists.The BSP member said the interests of the SCs/STs and the OBC were being hurt the most through privatisation and asked the government to bring a law to enforce reservation for SC/ST/OBC in the private sector.Sanjay Singh (AAP) charged that the government was selling off everything to private companies and big industrialists.Participating in the debate, Satish Chandra Misra of BSP asked the government to waive the customs duty on the import of radiation machines used for treatment of cancer patients.India is recording 12 lakh new cases of cancer every year. Besides, the country is witnessing around 5.5 lakh death every year, which is even higher than the total mortality of 1.5 lakh from COVID-19 in India, on which the government has spent more than Rs 35,000 crore for vaccine only.“Death by cancer is increasing every year and according to the alarming WHO report, every one among 15 people in India face the risk of cancer,” he said adding.According to Misra, all machines used for radiation therapy were either imported from Sweden or the US.Now in the budget, customs duty on radiation machines has been increased to 27.4 per cent.“Instead of encouraging, the government has increased the tax to 27.4 per cent from 20 per cent, which include customs duty, health cess, social welfare and GST,” he said asking the government to look into this aspect as it would earn only Rs 120 crore.Abdul Wahab of the IUML said the budget had failed to give any attention to farmers, students, migrant labourers, minorities and backward communities.Wahab also raised the issue of allocation of funds for a campus of Aligarh Muslim University at Malappuram and difficulties faced by retired army personnel in getting One Rank One Pension (OROP), to which Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur assured to look into.“OROP was pending for 30 to 40 years and the only person, who was able to implement it, is Narendra Modi. Thousands of crore rupees have been given to ex-servicemen,” Thakur said.Shiv Pratap Shukla of the BJP termed the budget as progressive. According to him, during the pandemic, the Modi government gave priority to health and not to economic growth.

The Delhi Police on Friday said the murder took place due to a business rivalry, and no communal angle should be attributed to it.The clarification by the police has come after some organisations started giving communal overtones to the murder, and hashtag Justice for Rinku Sharma trended on Twitter.Earlier, four persons—Danish, Islam, Zahid and Mehtab, accused of being involved in the case, were arrested.“We have made the fifth arrest in the murder case, We are ascertaining the role of Tajuddin. Further investigation is on,” said S. Dhama, Additional DCP, Outer Delhi.As political tempers ran high, and netizens on social media demanded justice for Rinku, many politicians and social activists visited the deceased’s family. At the same time, the Delhi Police has categorically stated that the incident does not have any communal angle.“So far, during investigation it has surfaced that quarrel started during a birthday party over shutting down of a restaurant. All persons are known to each other and they live in the same locality. Any other motive alluded to this incident is factually wrong,” said Dr A Koan, DCP Outer Delhi.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fifth-accused-in-mangolpuri-murder-case-arrested-211380

12-02-2021||New Delhi||SC says young adults choosing life partners mustn’t succumb to ‘class honour’||The Supreme Court, echoing B.R. Ambedkar’s views that remedy for breaking caste is inter-marriage, said boys and girls choosing their life partners cannot succumb to the concept of class honour or group thinking.A bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy observed: “Educated younger boys and girls are choosing their life partners which, in turn, is a departure from the earlier norms of society where caste and community played a major role.” Stressing it as a progressive outlook, the bench said this may reduce caste and community tensions brought out by inter-marriage.The bench said: “We are fortified in our view by earlier judicial pronouncements of this Court clearly elucidating that the consent of the family or the community or the clan is not necessary once the two adult individuals agree to enter into a wedlock and that their consent has to be piously given primacy.”The bench noted that intimacies of marriage lie within a core zone of privacy, which is inviolable and even matters of faith would have the least effect on them.“The right to marry a person of choice was held to be integral to Article 21 of the Constitution,” said the top court.A missing person complaint was lodged in Karnataka by the father of a girl after she eloped and married a person, based in north India, without informing him. The investigating officer after learning about their marriage insisted that the girl should appear in person at a police station to record a statement to close the case, and if she fails, then there is a possibility of kidnapping case against her husband.Faced with these dire consequences, the couple moved the Supreme Court, which criticized the police officer’s conduct putting the girl under threat of action.The top court said the choice of an individual is an inextricable part of dignity, for dignity cannot be thought of where there is the erosion of choice.“Such a right or choice is not is not expected to succumb to the concept of ‘class honour’ or ‘group thinking’,” said the top court.Quashing the FIR lodged by the girl’s father, the bench said it expects the police authorities to take action in this behalf in the next eight weeks to lay down some guidelines and training programmes on how to handle such socially sensitive cases.The bench emphasized that the girl’s family should accept the marriage and re-establish social interaction with the couple. “Under the garb of caste and community to alienate the child and the son-in-law will hardly be a desirable social exercise,” added the bench.Concluding the order, the bench cited B.R. Ambedkar: “Where society is cut asunder, marriage as a binding force becomes a matter of urgent necessity. The real remedy for breaking caste is inter-marriage. Nothing else will serve as the solvent of caste.”—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-says-young-adults-choosing-life-partners-mustnt-succumb-to-class-honour-211376

Khayal rakho apna n parivaar ka. God bless n loveee u,” he captioned the post.To all my fans.. thank u for your love support n concern. Khayal rakho apna n parivaar ka.

The petition stated that Khan said his arms licence had been lost. However, the investigation revealed that the actor had submitted it for renewal in Mumbai’s Bandra.While on the other hand, another PIL earlier stated that the actor had submitted an affidavit citing the reason for not appearing to the court — which is an ache in his ear but he was found busy in shooting. However, the trial court has earlier quashed both of the petitions.The lawyer representing the government said: “We have not received the copy of judgment yet. After receiving it, we will think to take the matter to the High Court.”Salman Khan was booked under Section 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act for poaching two chinkaras in Bhawad village on September 26-27, 1998, and one chinkara in Mathania on September 28, 1998.

12-02-2021||New Delhi||Govt talking to judiciary about concerns over Judicial Standards Bill||The Union Government on Thursday said that it was in dialogue with the judiciary regarding concerns over The Judicial Standard and Accountability Bill, 2010, and consultations were under way.Responding to a question by MP KTS Tulsi, who sought to know the status of the Bill during Question Hour in Rajya Sabha, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the Bill had been passed before the BJP came to power. “It was pending before the Lok Sabha but because of the dissolution of the Lok Sabha, it lapsed,” the minister said.When Tulsi and BSP’s Satish Chandra Mishra asked if the Bill would be resurrected, Prasad said the judiciary had some concerns over certain provisions of the Bill that impinged upon its independence.“When we had discussions, there were certain issues on the Bill brought by the UPA Government on which the judiciary had reservations. Dialogue and consultation is going on. As regards the appointing authority, while we respect the institution of the collegium, as a government, we are also a stakeholder and continue to insist that. As regards the removal of judges, both houses of Parliament had unanimously passed the National Judicial Appointments Commission Bill but ultimately, the Supreme Court repealed it on grounds and reasons which I wish to say clearly that we don’t appreciate. But it is the law of the land,” said the minister.Prasad added that the government respected the independence of the judiciary.He also informed the Rajya Sabha, “One sitting judge had been prosecuted by the CBI with the proper sanction of the CJI and the President and one retired Chief Justice of High Court has been arrested. Therefore, these are positive moments. I agree there is a need to strengthen the mechanism on which we are working. But the entire architecture of law needs some further clarity from the judiciary.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-talking-to-judiciary-about-concerns-over-judicial-standards-bill-211359

TS Singh Deoji, rather than sensationalising non-issues, kindly focus on improving vaccine coverage in the state," Harsh Vardhan tweeted."You would appreciate that this coverage needs to improve significantly since adequate quantities of both the vaccines are available with the state," his letter to Deo read.The minister also rebuffed Deo's claim about absence of the expiry date from the vials."Your concern regarding unavailability of expiry date on Covaxin vial is also completely unfounded and without basis as the same is mentioned on the labels of vaccine vials," Vardhan wrote while he attached a photo of a vial with the label.

We welcome the ongoing efforts to de-escalate the situation,” a State Department spokesperson told PTI.“We will, of course, continue to monitor the situation closely as both sides work toward a peaceful resolution,” the spokesperson said while responding to a question on China and India pulling back their troops from eastern Ladakh.Congressman Michael McCaul, lead Republican in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also welcomed the disengagement of troops.“It is heartening to see India stand strong in defending its sovereignty,” he said in a tweet.“The (Chinese Communist Party) CCP’s constant territorial aggression, from the East and South China Seas to the waters of the Mekong, to the Himalayas, has no place in the 21st century,” McCaul said.India and China had rushed a large number of battle tanks, armoured vehicles and heavy equipment to the treacherous and high-altitude areas of eastern Ladakh region after tension escalated following a deadly clash in the Galwan Valley in June last.As many as 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the fierce hand-to-hand combat on June 15 in the Galwan Valley, an incident that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in decades.China is yet to disclose the number of its soldiers killed and injured in the clash though it officially admitted to have suffered casualties.

Well over 1,00,000 constituents, incredibly from every single one of the 650 UK constituencies, have signed an online petition, including more than 3,000 from my Slough constituency.Over 100,000, incredibly from all 650 #UK constituencies (inc 3K+ from Slough), signed online petition;adding to 100+ MPs who wrote to PM.Given arrests of journalists and activists like #NodeepKaur, need Parliament debate ASAP on #FarmersProtest -largest protest on the planet. pic.twitter.com/E88c1pHqdw  "Given those facts, and given the arrest of journalists, peaceful protesters and human rights activists such as Nodeep Kaur, who, it is alleged, has been tortured and endured sexual assault while in police custody, will the Leader of the House please facilitate a debate on this important matter at the earliest opportunity, just as we debated a petition in this Chamber last week?"At this Rees-Mogg replied, "The honourable gentleman raises something that is a matter of concern across the House and across constituencies."The right to peaceful protest is a fundamental one, along with freedom of speech and Internet freedom. India is a very proud democracy and a country with which we have the strongest possible relations. I happen to think that over the next century our relationship with India may well be our most important relationship with any country in the world."He said, "As India is our friend, it is only right that we make representations when we think that things are happening that are not in the interests of the reputation of the country of which we are a friend. The Foreign Secretary discussed the farmers' protest with his Indian counterpart in December.Nodeep Kaur, a 23-year-old labour rights activist, was picked up by the police along with others on January 12 while she was protesting during the farmers' agitation.

12-02-2021||Washington||India is a red-hot investment opportunity for its clean energy transition: John Kerry||India is actually a red-hot investment opportunity for its clean energy transition, top US official John Kerry said on Thursday as he praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his commitment to addressing the challenge posed by climate change, which the Biden Administration believes poses an existential threat to humanity.Kerry, the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, said he intends to work "very, very closely with" with Indian leadership including Prime Minister Modi and External Minister S Jaishankar."We believe India can be one of the most critical transitional countries in this entire endeavour. I am confident that just as we have worked very closely on any number of issues in these last years, our two nations -- the world's two biggest democracies -- have a great deal to gain from joining hands in our global leadership and confronting the climate crisis to meet this moment," he said."India is actually a red-hot investment opportunity for its clean energy transition," Kerry, the first official on climate to be inside the US National Security Council, said in his address to the World Sustainable Development Summit 2021.Looking forward to visiting India soon, Kerry said that the prime minister has made a very important contribution to this dialogue. Needless to say, India is deeply committed to this challenge and it has been for a considerable number of years, he said."You are indisputably a world leader in the deployment of renewable energy and your leadership of the International Solar Alliance, which Minister Jaishankar referred to, is absolutely critical for not just India, but for other dynamic, growing economies in the world,” Kerry said.Prime Minister Modi's announcement of a target of 450 gigawatts of renewables by 2030 is a strong, terrific example of how to power a growing economy with clean energy, and it's going to be one of the most important contributions because India today is already the third largest emitter in the world behind the United States and China, he said.Referring to a latest report of the International Energy Agency, he said India's down payment on the clean energy transition puts it on pace to become the global market leader in solar and storage by 2040. "And thanks to your rapid scale-up, it's already cheaper to build solar in India than anywhere else in the world. That kind of urgency is exactly what we need in order to confront the crisis that we confront today," he said.After coming to power, the Biden Administration has quickly established contacts with the Indian leadership. The leadership of the two countries at the top level have known each other for long and have put the relationship on fast-track. In a recent interview, India's Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, had identified climate change as one of the key pillars of collaboration between the two countries.It was one of the topics of discussion between Prime Minister Modi and President Joe Biden earlier this week and also when they spoke in November soon after the US election results were announced.In his speech, Kerry made it clear that India is a key partner of the US under the Biden Administration and would take it over from where the relationship was left by the previous Trump Administration.

The Class 10 girl initially stopped going to school as her parents could not deposit the Rs 3,000 in school fee arrears and then when she continued to receive phone calls from school, she took the drastic step. Identified as Yashaswini, 15, sources said the school staff was allegedly pressuring her to pay the dues. Her parents told the police that she was depressed as she was unable to continue her studies.  Schools in Telangana reopened on February 1, after nearly 10 months and all class 9 and above students are expected to attend classes in person. “As the school staff was forcing her to call her father for fee, she stopped going to school”, her friend told the police. Her parents said when they returned home from work on Thursday evening, they found the house at Kakatiyanagar in Neredmet locked from inside.  “Despite repeated knocks, there was no response, so we broke the door latch to find her hanging by a rope”, the parents said. Inspector A Narasimha Swamy at the Neredmet police station under Rachakonda Police Commissionerate said the police have registered a case of death under suspicious circumstances and took up investigation. Police said there was no suicide note.  The police official, however, said the girl’s parents had not complained of harassment by the school. “The girl’s parents said they had paid Rs 15,000 as fee despite the loss of earnings during the lockdown and had promised to clear the dues later,” Swamy said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unable-to-pay-school-fee-girls-commits-suicide-211338

He spun around an old family planning slogan “hum do hamare do” to make his point.“The nation is being run by four persons,” said Rahul.Rahul Gandhi, Congress leader‘Hum do, humare do’Rural economy will be destroyed and the country will not be able to generate employment. This is not the first time PM Modi has tried to benefit hum do, humare do. He first did it with demonetisation and then GST.He did not name anyone, saying everyone knew who he was talking about. His comments resulted in a virtual bedlam in the House, with allegations flying against his (Gandhi) family and Union Minister Anurag Thakur, accusing him of “telling lies” and coming unprepared to speak on Union Budget.“The PM has given us three options — hunger, unemployment and suicide,” said Rahul, amid repeated disruptions and requests by Speaker Om Birla to restrict his speech to the Budget. Rahul did not take their names but Union Minister Pralhad Joshi, who raised the point of order and asked him to prove his claims, ended taking the names of two corporates.“Let me tell what will happen when these laws are enacted. Small farmers and traders will be wiped out and only ‘hum do hamare do’ will run the country,” said the Congress leader.“Do not think it is farmers’ agitation alone. It is the agitation of the entire country. Farmers are showing way to the country, which is rising against ‘hum do, hamare do’....Let me give you in writing. Farmers will not move back an inch. You will have to take back the three laws,” warned the Congress leader.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/laws-will-destroy-mandis-help-corporates-rahul-211044

Besides, freight rates on major routes from India have almost doubled as compared to last year.During October-December 2020, Chinese exports to the US increased by 19 per cent ($44,828 million) in value terms as compared to the corresponding period in 2019.China’s total exports expanded 13.5 per cent on year-on-year basis in December 2020, compared with an increase of 25.4 per cent in the previous month. The surge made China number one US trade partner in December last year. It had ranked number three in the same month in 2019.“Since China’s hands are full with export orders, many shipping lines have repositioned their containers in China, leading to an increase in freight rates,” said a source.According to industry experts, containers are stuck in the US even as these are needed in emerging economies such as India.There were reports that shipping companies had rejected US farm exports in the last quarter of 2020 and rather sent empty containers back to China to be filled with more profitable goods since China was paying a premium for it.According to Indian exporters, freight has risen by almost 100 per cent since last year. “The freight rate for a 40-ft container to be shipped to New York has shot up to over $3,800 in February this year. The same was $1,900-2,000 last year,” said Anand S Chawla of the North India Steamer Agents Association.China trade with US (in million dollars)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-exports-to-us-up-indian-traders-hit-211194

But as the water level in the river rose, the workers scrambled out of the tunnel with their heavy machinery. The aim was to set up a life-saving system, possibly to pump oxygen into the blocked tunnel, said officials.Chamoli District Magistrate Swati S Bhadauria said the work was temporarily halted as a precautionary measure and resumed around 5.30 pm after assessing the situation.A senior Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) official said, “The drilling operation towards the slush flushing tunnel was stopped later in the day after approximately 7 to 8 metres of drill. A hard rock obstructed the cutters to operate. The rescue teams are now removing the slush again as earlier with JCB loader machines.”As the continuous flow of slush and silt remained a major obstacle between the rescuers and those feared trapped inside, a boring operation by a huge machine was also being undertaken to see if the problem could be addressed in a different way and the teams could reach further inside, the official said. The focal point of the rescue operation now remains the 1.5-km head-race tunnel, a part of the 2.5-km long network of tunnels.Drilling through the debris started from around 68 metres inside the tunnel and the focus at the moment is to take life-saving devices such as oxygen cylinders to those trapped by drilling, the official said, adding that the drilling was to be done for 12 metres to access the probable location of those trapped.Till Wednesday, about 120 metres of slush from the mouth of the tunnel was cleared and those feared trapped inside were stated to be located somewhere at 180 metres, where the tunnel takes a slip or a turn.A rescuer said those trapped inside must be in a bad shape without food and water, “but there was hope against hope that they would be surviving somehow as the temperature inside the tunnel was about 20-25 degrees Celsius and some oxygen was possibly available to them”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scare-at-rescue-site-as-river-level-rises-again-211193

Moments before Trudeau made the phone call to Modi, the Canadian opposition had seized on the breaking down of the vaccine supply chain to embarrass the Trudeau government.The MEA said Trudeau had also said if the world managed to conquer Covid, it would be also due to India’s tremendous pharmaceutical capacity and Modi’s leadership in sharing this capacity with the world.The Health Minister was asked by her rival shadow Health Minister if Canada was planning to approach India for emergency requisitioning of vaccines. The questioning was against the background of Ottawa’s strained ties with India, first over supporting separatists and recently on farmers’ stir. The minister was non-committal, but embarrassed after Delhi let it be known that Trudeau had called up Modi seeking vaccines. Ottawa attempted to retrieve some of the ground by stating that Trudeau discussed many important issues, including the farmers’ protests.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/facing-vax-shortage-trudeau-dials-modi-211192

These would also address privacy issues, he assured.Ravi Shankar Prasad, IT ministerDouble standardsWhen Capitol Hill is ransacked, the micro-blogging site (Twitter) stands with them… when Red Fort is attacked, it stands against law enforcement agencies. Speaking in the Rajya Sabha earlier, the Minister warned Twitter, Facebook and others against violating Indian laws if they wished to do business here.“What kind of a joke is this? We have flagged this to Twitter and IT officials are in touch with them. When the Capitol Hill is ransacked and the US police take action, the micro-blogging site stands with them. And when Red Fort in India is attacked, the same site stands against law enforcement agencies. These double standards are not acceptable.”Prasad said the Indian Constitution guaranteed freedom of expression, but Article 19 (A) mentioned reasonable restrictions to this right in matters of national security and sovereignty.“We respect the social media. We also respect the right to criticise. You can criticise anyone from the PM to the ministers. That is part of the Constitution but if social media is used to spread fake news, violence and disaffection, there will be strong action. If someone misuses social media to manipulate elections through corrupt means, action will be taken. We wish to tell Twitter, FB or LinkedIn or WhatsApp — work in India, you have crores of followers here. Make money but you will have to follow the Indian Constitution and laws,” Prasad said in PM Narendra Modi’s presence during the Question Hour.The draft guidelines Prasad mentioned, meanwhile, seek to regulate social and digital media, including over the top (OTT) platforms and web-based news portals.These speak of a self-regulatory system with a code of ethics (as in case of TV channels), a compliance officer to respond to concerns flagged by law enforcement agencies, timely submission of compliance reports by social and digital media players, a grievance redressal structure and powers to bureaucracy to act in emergencies within 48 hours should the platform in question refuse to comply.The minister also flagged violent content being peddled by social media. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/follow-indian-laws-minister-warns-twitter-fb-amid-row-211191
12-02-2021||Ajay Banerjee||Depsang to be tackled next||Tribune news ServiceNew Delhi, February 11India and China’s disengagement process to pull back their militaries from the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is expected to be carried out in multiple phases.Along the 823-km LAC in eastern Ladakh, both militaries are eyeball to eyeball at some locations. The disengagement process, which commenced yesterday, is only restricted to both banks of the Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake. It is expected to complete in four weeks.After Pangong Tso pullback, the next phase will include resumption of patrolling limits in certain LAC areas claimed by both sides. Thereafter, the issue of the 900-sq km Depsang plains located north of the Shyok river will be tackled. Located at an altitude of 16,000 feet, the Indian Army occupies a large portion of the Depsang plains while the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China holds its eastern edge. There was a massive build-up by both sides in 2020, which needs to be scaled down. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told the Rajya Sabha on Thursday about the future course to ease the standoff. “There are some outstanding issues with regard to deployment and patrolling at some other points (besides the Pangong Tso) along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. These will be the focus of further discussions with the Chinese side,” he said.Sources said the next phase would start after full verification of the completion of the first phase in the Pangong Tso area.From India’s perspective, Depsang is vital as the PLA could threaten the Indian strategic airfield at Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO), located at 16,700 feet. The DBO is just 20 km south of 18,176-foot-high Karakoram pass, which divides Ladakh and Xinjiang in China.Also the 255-km Darbuk-Shyok-DBO (DSDBO) road close to the LAC is vulnerable to threat, and any attempt to cut off DBO could restrict access to the Karakoram pass.3 Key principlesFuture course||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/depsang-to-be-tackled-next-211174

A meeting of senior commanders within 48 hours of the complete disengagement will sort out the remaining wrinkles in the Pangong Tso sector, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced in the Rajya Sabha today.Aiming for April 2020 status quoThe Minister revealed specifics of the withdrawal on the north bank which began on Wednesday. The Chinese army will pull back its troops to the east of Finger 8 and Indian troops will be based at their permanent location near Finger 3 area. The area between Finger 3 and Finger 8 will not be patrolled till a resolution on future deployment is reached.The bunkers and other structures built by the Chinese army between Finger 4 and 8 will be dismantled.Some outstanding issues regarding deployment and patrolling at some other points along the LAC in eastern Ladakh will be the focus of further discussions with the Chinese side. “This pact will substantially restore the situation to that existing prior to the commencement of the standoff last year,” Rajnath said, adding the aim is to achieve complete disengagement and restoration of status quo.The disengagement will take place in a “phased, coordinated and verified” manner. “I want to remind the House we haven’t lost anything,” Rajnath declared. “Our approach has been guided by the resolve that we will not give even an inch of Indian territory. Our tenacity and approach during talks have yielded results,” he said.With the backing of the Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu, Rajnath did not provide clarifications to members on grounds of national security considerations. The Defence Minister complimented the troops for their valour and courage on both banks of the Pangong Tso and said the nation would always remember the sacrifices by the soldiers which have been the foundation of the disengagement from the Pangong lake.“Our armed forces proved yet again that territorial integrity of our country remains safe in their hands,” he added.To ensure disengagement, the Indian side had insisted that troops of both sides, who are now in close proximity, should vacate the forward deployments made in 2020 and return to the permanent and accepted bases.“Our approach and strategy for negotiations with the Chinese side has been guided at the highest level by the PM’s resolve that we will not give even an inch of the Indian territory,” he said.Disengagement process||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-to-return-to-finger-8-rajnath-211120

Jolted by the Sunday deluge that killed at least 32 and left 176 missing, locals are at pains to absorb the fact that floods have devastated Raini, the birthplace of Chipko movement, which originated here and went on to mother several environment campaigns in India and abroad.Among all villages ravaged by the tragedy, Raini, situated on the banks of Dhaulaganga, has suffered the most. Large swathes of the once vibrant land stand bare reduced to smithereens by the assault of nature. Locals now say they had premonitions of a disaster.Raini village pradhan Bhagwan Singh Reni said, “The destruction in the Chamoli region was feared long back in 2005 when the works on the Rishiganga 520 MW power project first started. In 2019, we approached the Uttarakhand High Court through a PIL alleging unfair and environmentally hazardous practices being adopted by the private company involved, but to no avail.” Villagers say they sporadically approached the Joshimath SDM and warned him against stone-crushing works in the middle of the riverbed wreaking havoc on local flora and fauna and damaging the fragile eco-space of the region. “No one heeded us.

12-02-2021||Washington||Biden admin urged not to issue H-1B to Indians till country cap on Green Card is removed||An influential immigration advocacy group representing Indian-Americans on Thursday urged the Biden administration not to issue the most sought-after H-1B work visa to any individual born in India, till the time the discriminatory country-cap on green cards or permanent legal residency is removed.The current per-country cap on issuing of green cards in the US has resulted in Indian professionals, mostly from the IT sector, having to wait for decades for their legal permanent residency. Issuing new H-1B visas to more Indians would add to this agonising painful wait for green cards, Immigration Voice said in a statement.The statement came in response to the Biden administration’s decision to allow employers of H-1B visa holders to begin registration online for the H1-B Visa lottery, starting March 9 this year, for the fiscal year 2022.Under the system, over 60,000 additional Indian nationals will unwittingly be lured to enter the United States this year (and every year) to “engage in a life of indentured servitude” where their very existence and the “lives of their families will be completely subject to the whims of their employer, new administrations, or even individual immigration adjudicators having a bad day,” said Aman Kapoor, president of Immigration Voice.It means that if Vice-President Kamala Harris’ mother had come to the United States today, under such a system, she would never have gotten a Green Card in her lifetime.Aman Kapoor, president, Immigration VoiceThe membership of Immigration Voice called on the Biden administration to use its authority under INA Section 212(f) to exclude any new individual born in India who are not currently in the United States legally from obtaining a new H-1B visa for the first time in Fiscal Year 2022, he said.“Moreover, Immigration Voice calls to stop issuing such new H-1B visas until the discriminatory per country limits on Employment-Based green cards are finally lifted and immigrants from India are no longer treated as indentured servants in the United States,” Kapoor said.In the current system, the only people who benefit are unscrupulous employers, staffing companies across various industries who profit enormously from maintaining the status quo, and immigration lawyers who profit from being able to process the maximum number of immigration applications possible by keeping Indian immigrants tied to an endless line of renewals of H-1B visa applications while also double-dipping to keep the Green Card pool open for people from other countries, he said.Immigration Voice is a national non-profit organisation with over 130,000 members, who are taxpaying, law-abiding, high-skilled immigrants, that advocates for the alleviation of restrictions on employment, travel, and working conditions faced by legal high-skilled immigrants in the US working as doctors, researchers, scientists, engineers, and other high-skilled professionals at many of America’s hospitals, universities and Fortune 500 companies.As mandated by the Congress, each year, the US issues 85,000 new H-1B visas. Of these, approximately 70 per cent of those new visas (or nearly 60,000 visas) are issued to workers from India, Immigration Voice said.“At the same time, discriminatory per-country limits established during the time of segregation, restrict Indian nationals to receive only 8,400 of the 120,000 employment based green cards available each year,” Kapoor said.The non-partisan Congressional Research Service says that this “discriminatory and arbitrary” cap on the number of Indian nationals who can receive lawful permanent residency each year has created a backlog of over one million people waiting for green cards, with a wait time of over 195 years, he said, adding that in fiscal year 2030, the line is expected to grow to 436 years.“A majority of the Green Card backlog consists of women and children, who will eventually die in these backlogs. Needless to say, the per-country limits on the employment-based green card system are, in fact, 100 per cent, an ‘Indian Exclusion Act’. In reality, this implies a de facto ban on employment-based green cards for any new Indian national entering the United States on an H-1B visa,” Kapoor said.“It means that if Vice-President Kamala Harris’ mother had come to the United States today, under such a system, she would never have gotten a Green Card in her lifetime. The course of Shyamala Gopalan’s daughter’s life would have been entirely different if she had been preoccupied with her mother’s possible deportation, as opposed to living her life as an American,” Kapoor said.

The park is being used by protesting farmers to discuss the prevailing situation of the ongoing agitation while guests coming here from Punjab use the room to stay.“Heaps of garbage were lying at the site and foul smell emanating from the garbage irritated those staying nearby, hence people of our village decided to clean the site and to develop a park so that farmers could feel relaxed here hence this park has been given the name of ‘Sanjhi Chhat’ as it is for everyone,” said Gurcharan Singh, a farmer from Manuke Gill village (Moga), adding that they had also been organising a langar near the park for the past two months.Labh Singh, another farmer, maintained they lifted the garbage through tractor-trailers and then did earth-filling and levelled the surface. Plants were sown and flower pots were bought to give the site a shape of park. Benches were arranged and chairs were brought here from Punjab. A makeshift room at the park had become a centre of attraction. It was used for making stay arrangements for guests coming from Punjab, he added.“Different groups of farmers staying at other places at the border daily used to come to the park to talk about the ongoing situation with us.

12-02-2021||---||CBSE issues guidelines for class 9, 11 exams; recommends new academic session begin from April 1||New Delhi, February 11The Central Board of Secondary Education has directed schools under it to take steps to identify and resolve learning gaps, and then conduct examinations for Classes 9 and 11 by following COVID-19 safety protocols.The board has also recommended that the new academic session begin from April 1.“For Classes 9 and 11, schools should take steps to identify and remedy the learning gaps and thereafter, conduct examinations by strictly following COVID-19 safety protocols as per the Examination Bye-Laws,” the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Controller of Examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said in a letter to school principals.“This exam will also help in identifying learning gaps which could be addressed by schools in the new academic session, at the beginning of classes, by having a bridge course specially designed to address learning gaps,” he said.Schools were shut in March last year as a precautionary measure following the outbreak of the coronavirus. During the subsequent nationwide lockdown, students moved to online classes. But as restrictions were gradually eased from June last year, schools reopened partially in a few states from October 2020 onwards.In the letter, Bhardwaj said, “While holding examinations/classes, COVID-19 safety protocols should be followed strictly.  It would be appropriate to start the academic session 2021-2022 from April 1 to the extent feasible subject to the instructions of state governments.”            Schools are requested to follow the suggestions to make the next session more streamlined and ensure that learning gaps, if any, are addressed, he added.“Schools have opened in a majority of states and with the improvement of COVID-19 pandemic situation, it is expected that schools will be opened in other states and union territories. Schools should be fully geared up and prepared to welcome the students for face to face classes. This will help students attend schools for completing their practicals,” Bhardwaj said.The CBSE had earlier this month announced the schedule for board exams for classes 10 and 12.“The board has taken decision to reschedule the class 10 and 12 exams from May-June, because of the unprecedented situation arising due to COVID-19 Pandemic. As a result a number of schools have been seeking advice from CBSE regarding examinations for classes 9 and 11 and about the commencement of new academic session,” Bhardwaj said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-issues-guidelines-for-class-9-11-exams-recommends-new-academic-session-begin-from-april-1-210946
12-02-2021||New Delhi||Air travel becomes expensive; govt raises limits on domestic airfares by 10-30 pc||Passengers will have to shell out more money for air travel from now as the Civil Aviation Ministry on Thursday increased the lower and upper limits on domestic airfares by 10 to 30 per cent.These new limits would remain “in force up to March 31, 2021, or until further orders”, the ministry said its order on Thursday.While announcing the resumption of scheduled domestic flights on May 21 last year, the ministry had placed limits on airfares through seven bands classified on the basis of flight duration.The first such band consists of flights that are of less than 40 minutes duration. The lower limit for the first band was increased on Thursday from Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,200. The upper limit in this band was set at Rs 7,800, which was Rs 6,000 earlier.The subsequent bands are for flights with durations of 40-60 minutes, 60-90 minutes, 90-120 minutes, 120-150 minutes, 150-180 minutes and 180-210 minutes.The fresh lower and upper limits set by the ministry for these bands on Thursday were: Rs 2,800 - Rs 9,800; Rs 3,300 – Rs 11,700; Rs 3,900 – Rs 13,000; Rs 5,000 – Rs 16,900; Rs 6,100 – Rs 20,400; Rs 7,200 – Rs 24,200, respectively.Till date, the lower and upper limits for these bands were: Rs 2,500 - Rs 7,500; Rs 3,000 - Rs 9,000; Rs 3,500 - Rs 10,000; Rs 4,500 - Rs 13,000; Rs 5,500 - Rs 15,700 and Rs 6,500 - Rs 18,600, respectively.Aviation regulator DGCA had said on May 21 last year that each airline would sell at least 40 per cent of its tickets on a flight at prices less than the midpoint between the lower limit and upper limit.Domestic passenger services resumed on May 25 after nearly two months of suspension to combat the coronavirus outbreak.Along with the limits on airfares, the government had asked the airlines to operate not more than 33 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights. On June 26, the cap was increased to 45 per cent. This was gradually increased to 80 per cent. The ministry said on Thursday that the 80 per cent limit would remain in place till March-end.The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the coronavirus pandemic.All Indian carriers last year took cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, leave without pay and firing of employees in order to conserve cash.Scheduled international passenger traffic continues to remain suspended in India since March 23, 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, special international flights have been operating since July 2020 under air bubble arrangements formed with various countries.

She started opposing the CAA and saying she will never allow it. The BJP always fulfils the promises it makes. We have brought this law and refugees will get citizenship."As soon as the COVID vaccination process ends the process of granting citizenship under CAA will begin," he said, addressing a rally here in the bastion of the Matua community.Matuas, originally from East Pakistan, are weaker section Hindus who migrated to India during the Partition and after the creation of Bangladesh. Many of them have been accorded Indian citizenship but a sizeable section of the population has not.Shah said Banerjee would not be in a position to oppose the implementation of the CAA as she would cease to be the Chief Minister after the Assembly polls likely in April-May this year.

Their certificates have been revoked, the ministry said.After receiving a complaint about the fake ascent, the ministry had formed a committee to investigate the matter.“The investigation has confirmed that both of them had obtained certificates by giving false details,” the spokesperson was quoted as saying by the daily.They have been banned from ascending any mountain in Nepal for six years. The ban will be effective starting May 20, 2016, it said.Their Indian team leader Naba Kumar Phukon, who led the expedition, has also been banned for six years starting May 20, 2016.The government has also imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on the Seven Summit Treks Pvt Ltd, the agency which organised the expedition for the Indian nationals.The ministry has also warned Pawan Kumar Ghimire, the liaison officer of the team, not to repeat such mistakes in the future. The ministry has also decided to impose a fine of Rs 10,000 on Nga Dawa Sherpa, the climbing supporter during the expedition.Sherpa had filed false documents claiming that Yadav had successfully climbed Mt Everest.This is not the first time that climbers have been confirmed of faking the summit of Mt Everest.Dinesh and Tarakeshwari Rathod, an Indian couple, who were part of a different expedition in the spring of 2016, had also claimed that they had scaled Mt Everest and obtained the expedition certificate by submitting false details, the daily said.Their climbing recognition was also revoked by the DoT.Aiming to reduce such activities, the government has been dwelling on installing GPS tracking system in the mountains. However, no progress has been made on this front yet. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-bans-three-indian-climbers-for-six-years-for-faking-mt-everest-summit-210927
12-02-2021||New Delhi||'Hum do hamare do’, Rahul Gandhi accuses govt of ‘destroying ‘mandis’ and promoting hoarding to benefit corporate friends’||In a stinging attack against the Narendra Modi government, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused it of “destroying ‘mandis’ and promoting hoarding to benefit a couple of corporate friends” all the while spinning around an old family planning slogan, “hum do hamare do”, to make his point.“The nation is being run by four people ‘hum do hamare do’,” Gandhi said. He did not name anyone saying that everyone knows who he was talking about but his comments resulted in a virtual bedlam in the House with allegations flying against his (Gandhi) family and Union minister Anurag Thakur accusing him of “telling lies” and coming unprepared to speak on Union Budget.   Participating in what was otherwise a discussion on the Union Budget in Lok Sabha, Gandhi said yesterday Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the Opposition is talking of agitation but not intent and content of farm laws.“So I thought let me make him happy and talk about content and intent of farm Bills,” he said.According to the Wayanad MP, “The content of the first law is to finish the ‘mandis’ and its intent is to give one friend the right to have all the crops of India. The content of the second law is to end the essential commodities act and its intent is to help the second friend hoard grains, fruits, vegetables etc. The content of the third law is when a farmer goes before the biggest businessman of India to demand the right price for his crops, he will not be allowed to go to the court.”The PM has given us three options “of hunger, unemployment and suicide”, he said amid repeated disruptions and requests by Speaker Om Birla, asking him to restrict his speech to the Budget. Gandhi did not say their names but Union minister Pralhad Joshi, who raised the point of order and asked him to prove his claims, ended taking the names of the two corporates.  Gandhi said:  “’Hum do hamare do’....you remember those cute, cuddly faces… Let me tell what will happen when these laws are enacted, small farmers and traders will be wiped out and only ‘hum do hamare do’ will run the country.”“Rural economy will be destroyed and this country will not be able to generate employment. This is not the first time he (PM Modi) has tried to benefit ‘hum do humare do’, he first did it with demonetisation and then GST,” Gandhi alleged, accusing the government of “breaking the spinal cord of the country”.“Do not think it is farmers’ agitation, it is the agitation of the entire country. Farmers are showing way to the country which is rising against ‘hum do hamare do’…Let me give you in writing, farmers will not move back an inch, you will have to take back the three laws,” Gandhi warned , also asking the House to maintain silence of two minutes in honour of farmers who died during the agitation. On this Speaker Om Birla said the responsibility of running the House is with him.“Tomorrow someone will get up and say he wants to pay respect to jawans killed on border…or those killed in Uttarakhand tragedy. Let me run the House,” Birla said.When Gandhi said he will not speak on Budget but only farmers’ issues, Anurag Thakur intervened saying he had hoped a senior leader (like Rahul Gandhi) will know about rules of the House.“I understand he (Rahul Gandhi) has not prepared his Budget speech. But then some people spend less time in House and also the country...I understand he is going again,” Thakur said, calling the Budget a “hope to build for new, stronger and self-reliant India”.  “But then some people have always done politics on poverty, which a poor mother’s son has tried to change,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hum-do-hamare-do-rahul-gandhi-accuses-govt-of-destroying-mandis-and-promoting-hoarding-to-benefit-corporate-friends-210923

I spent 30 min on this new Koo app. The app is leaking of the personal data of his users: email, dob, name, marital status, gender," said Alderson as he also posted a screenshot of a user data.You asked so I did it.

12-02-2021||New Delhi||Respect Indian laws if you want to do business, govt tells Twitter and Facebook||The Centre on Thursday categorically said in the Rajya Sabha that action will be taken against Social Media platforms if fake news and violence is spread through it.“There is freedom of speech but Article 19A says that this is subject to reasonable restrictions,” said Communications, Electronics & Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.“We respect social media a lot, it has empowered common people. Social media has a big role in the Digital India programme. However, if social media are misused to spread fake news and violence, then action will be taken on the misuse of social media in India whether Twitter or else,” said Prasad.He said all the social media platforms will have to adhere to the constitution of India. The Indian constitution allows criticism of the government and the Prime Minister, but spreading fake news will not be allowed, he said.Prasad said, “We have flagged certain issues to Twitter and social media has to take into consideration of the Indian Laws if they want to do business in the country.“Different parameters can’t be allowed for different countries. It can’t be different for the Capitol Hill incident and some other parameters and for the Red Fort incident.”The Indian government on Wednesday expressed displeasure over Twitter’s delayed compliance on its order to remove “provocative” tweets amid the ongoing farmers’ protests.IT Secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney expressed Centre’s displeasure to Twitter’s management.An official statement issued late Wednesday night said the Secretary told Monique Meche, Vice President, Global Public Policy and Jim Baker, Deputy General Counsel and Vice President Legal of Twitter that delayed compliance to lawfully passed orders are “meaningless”.“Lawfully passed orders are binding on any business entity. They must be obeyed immediately. If they are executed days later, it becomes meaningless,” Sawhney was quoted as saying in the statement.The official expressed his deep disappointment to Twitter leadership about how Twitter has unwillingly, grudgingly and with great delay complied with the substantial parts of the order, the statement said.He also told Twitter that in India its Constitution and laws are supreme.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/respect-indian-laws-if-you-want-to-do-business-govt-tells-twitter-and-facebook-210852
12-02-2021||Tapovan/New Delhi||Uttarakhand disaster: Rescuers shift strategy, rising Dhauliganga triggers another scare||Rescue agencies began drilling through the debris in the Tapovan tunnel to establish contact with the over 30 people trapped inside after a flash flood, an operation which stalled briefly Thursday when the Dhauliganga river began swelling again.The confirmed death toll in the Uttarakhand disaster rose to 36 with the recovery of two more bodies along the riverbank and 168 people remain missing since Sunday, after an avalanche or a glacier break triggered a surge of water in the Alaknanda river system.In an apparent change in strategy, the rescuers are now also focusing on drilling through the hardened debris in the choked tunnel in Chamoli district, rather than just shifting mounds of silt and sludge heaped there by the sudden flood.The aim for now is to set up a “life-saving system”, possibly to pump oxygen into the blocked tunnel.The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and the Army are part of the multi-agency rescue effort, which continues even as hopes of finding the trapped workers alive recede with each passing hour.On Thursday afternoon, there was another scare when the water of the Dhauliganga – a tributary of the Alaknanda – began rising again.Rescue workers at the Tapovan site scrambled to safety, pulling their heavy machinery to higher ground. A press briefing ended midway and the operation halted.It resumed after 45 minutes with cautious officials saying they will send in only small teams to the rescue site for now.The centre of the rescue operation remains the 1.5-km “head-race tunnel”—a part of the 2.5-km long network of tunnels—at the 480-MW Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel power project of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).Rescuers began the drilling in the early hours of Thursday.“A drilling operation was started by the rescue teams at 2 am to peep into the slush-flushing tunnel that is about 12-13 metre below,” Vivek Kumar Pandey, the spokesperson for the lead rescue agency, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), said in Delhi.As the continuous flow of slush and silt remains a major obstacle between the rescuers and those trapped inside, a boring operation by a huge machine is being undertaken to see if this problem can be addressed in a different way and the teams can go further deep inside, he added.Drilling through the debris started from around 68 metre inside the tunnel, Garhwal Commissioner Ravinath Raman told PTI.The focus at the moment is to set up a “life-saving system”, including oxygen, for those trapped inside by drilling through the debris, Raman said.The drilling is to be done for 12 metre to access their probable location, he added.Till Wednesday, about 120 metre of sludge from the mouth of the tunnel was cleared and the trapped workers stated to be located somewhere at 180 metres, where the tunnel takes a turn.An officer had earlier said there was no doubt that those trapped inside must be in a bad situation without food and water.“But there is hope against hope that they are surviving somehow as the temperature inside the tunnel is about 20-25 degrees Celsius and some oxygen is possibly available to them,” the officer said.At the Tapovan press briefing, Garhwal Commissioner Raman was asked about reports of rising water level in the upper reaches of Rishiganga. The official said he had no authentic information, terming it as “no more than a rumour” at that point. Just then, fresh information came in and the press conference dispersed.“Our strategy is evolving as the situation unfolds,” he told reporters later.“We are coordinating with NTPC officials and scientists in running the rescue operation,” he said.Garhwal Range DIG Niru Garg said, “As you can see, all the agencies are working with perfect coordination with a resolve to save as many lives as possible.”When asked about the possible condition of those trapped in the tunnel for over four days, another official said, “I am a technical person. I wouldn’t hazard a guess. But as the Governor said, let’s all pray to Badri Vishal (Lord Vishnu) that all of them are safe.”Earlier, Uttarakhand Governor Baby Rani Maurya faced the angry family members of some missing workers when she visited the site. Some of them broke down as they asked her to get the rescue operation speeded up.Maurya asked them to be patient, assuring that the agencies involved will not spare any effort.The worried relatives also claimed that some of the machines were not working properly, slowing the pace of the rescue effort.Some also claimed that all the effort was focused on the tunnel, and not on finding people who went missing from the barrage at the same hydel project.ITBP chief S S Deswal had told PTI on Wednesday that his men and those from other agencies will continue with the operation for “any length of time” or till a logical conclusion is reached and the trapped workers located.

12-02-2021||---||India, China reach pact on disengagement in Pangong Lake areas in Ladakh: Rajnath||New Delhi, February 11India and China have started the process of disengagement from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake and a meeting of senior commanders within 48 hours will sort out the remaining issues of discord in this sector, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced in Rajya Sabha on Thursday.Opinion: Need a reality check on China’s designs“The implementation of this agreement will substantially restore the situation to that existing prior to commencement of the standoff last year,” said Singh. The disengagement, which began on Wednesday to end 10 months of troop deployment at forbidding heights and glacial temperatures, was brought about due to the resolute courage displayed by the armed forces and a sustained dialogue at the diplomatic level with China, he said.Also read: Government has failed to stimulate demand: ChidambaramUnder the agreement for disengagement, which will take place in a “phased, coordinated and verified” manner will mean that China will withdraw its troops to the east of Finger 8 on the north bank while Indian troops will be re-stationed at their permanent base on Finger 3.Both sides will also remove all military structures built after April 2020 but patrolling will remain suspended for the time being. “We hope the steps will eventually lead to restoration of the status quo. I want to remind the House that we have not lost anything,” Singh declared.Patrolling will be resumed only when both sides reach an agreement in diplomatic and military talks that would be held subsequently. “Our approach and strategy for negotiations with the Chinese side has been guided at the highest level by the Prime Minister’s resolve that we will not give even an inch of Indian territory. Our tenacity and approach during talks have yielded results,’’ he said.However, with the backing of the Chair, Rajnath declined to field questions from members. Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu cited national security considerations to dispense with the customary practice in the Upper House to ask supplementary questions after a minister has made a statement.Since September 2020, military and diplomatic officials of both sides have met several times to work out a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement. Till date, there have been nine rounds of meetings of the senior commanders of both sides.  Diplomatic talks have continued in parallel under the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs.The Defence Minister also paid fulsome tributes to the armed forces for their grit and resolve under extremely harsh climatic conditions of Ladakh which resulted in the present agreement. “Our nation will always remember the sacrifices made by our brave soldiers which have been the foundation of this disengagement at Pangong Tso Lake,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-reach-pact-on-disengagement-in-pangong-lake-areas-in-ladakh-rajnath-210846

This meant the United States has sought to avoid actions that overtly favoured either party. Over the past decade, however, Washington has grown closer to India while relations with Pakistan continue to be viewed as clouded by mistrust, CRS report said.On a question related to Twitter shutting down some accounts in India, Price said, “Well, I think what I would say generally is that around the world – and this goes back to what I was saying before – we are committed to supporting democratic values, including freedom of expression. I think when it comes to Twitter’s policies, we’d have to refer you to Twitter itself.”        Responding to a similar question, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference, “Of course, we always have concerns about crackdowns on freedom of speech, freedom of expression happening around the world and when it doesn’t allow people to communicate and peacefully protest.” —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-change-in-policy-on-jammu-and-kashmir-says-us-210835

Attaching the digital forensic report of Arsenal, Rona Wilson's lawyer Sudeep Pasbola on Wednesday filed a petition in the Bombay High Court seeking dismissal of the case against his client in the 2018 Bhima Koregaon violence.Arsenal has been retained by the defense team for Rona Jacob Wilson to analyze electronic evidence seized from his home by the Pune police department on April 17, 2018.A brief statement from Arsenal President Mark Spencer regarding Report I in the Bhima Koregaon case. #DFIR pic.twitter.com/UHiSK2YYXm"Arsenal received a hard drive on July 31, 2020, which contained forensic images and police work product related to Wilson and other defendants in the Bhima Koregaon case. Arsenal's analysis has been based largely on a forensic image obtained from the Toshiba hard drive within Wilson's computer and a thumb drive which had been attached to the computer," the digital firms' report said.Arsenal said that its analysis has revealed that Wilson's computer was compromised for just over 22 months, and the attacker responsible for compromising his computer "had extensive resources (including time) and it is obvious that their primary goals were surveillance and incriminating document delivery."The firm said it connected the same attacker to a significant malware infrastructure which has been deployed over the course of approximately four years to not only attack and compromise Wilson's computer for 22 months, but to attack his co-defendants in the Bhima Koregaon case and defendants in other high-profile Indian cases as well."It should be noted that this is one of the most serious cases involving evidence tampering that Arsenal has ever encountered, based on various metrics which include the vast timespan between the delivery of the first and last incriminating documents. Wilson's computer was compromised on June 13, 2016, after a series of suspicious emails with someone using Varavara Rao's email account," the report said.Varavara Rao is one of Wilson's co-defendants in the Bhima Koregaon case."Arsenal has found no evidence which would suggest that the top ten most important documents used in the prosecution against Wilson ("the top ten documents"15) were ever interacted with in any legitimate way on Wilson's computer.
