11-02-2021||New Delhi||Mughal Gardens to open for public from Saturday, visitors must do advance online booking||With strict social distancing measures, a cap on the number of visitors and no on-the-spot entry, the famed Mughal Gardens of the Rashtrapati Bhawan will kickstart its annual “Udyanotsav” amidst the coronavirus pandemic.The iconic garden at the Rashtrapati Bhawan will be opened for public by President Ram Nath Kovind from February 13, Deputy Press Secretary to the President, Keerti Tiwari, announced on Thursday.Visitors will be allowed in the sprawling garden, which boasts of thousands of flowers and plants, ranging from roses, daisies to lilies, throughout the week, barring Mondays.Booking can be made on https://rashtrapatisachivalaya.gov.in or https://rb.nic.in/rbvisit/visit_plan.aspx, according to a statement issued by the Rashtrapati Bhawan.There will be seven slots from 10 am to 5 pm and 100 people will be allowed in each slot to maintain social distancing. Not more than five people will be allowed to stand at one place so that appropriate distancing can be maintained, it said.Temperature checks will be done at the entry point of the garden and a person without a face mask will not be allowed to enter.The statement said as part of measures, visitors will not be allowed to bring items like bags, cameras, water bottles when they enter. Adequate arrangements for hand sanitisers, drinking water and toilets have been made, it said.However, there is no restriction to access as people can visit all three parts of the garden — rectangular, long and circular — apart from the spiritual, herbal and bonsai gardens, according to the statement.Tiwari said that people who are susceptible to diseases must avoid visiting the Mughal Gardens this year.“It is a beautiful place where you can see a lot of varieties of flowers. The flora and fauna here is a sight to watch. In the time of coronavirus, I think looking at colourful flowers is the biggest hope that people can come across,” she said.Tiwari said that the cap on the number of visitors was unavoidable due to the pandemic.“It is going to be limited because we have to maintain and follow our social distancing norms. There will be 100 people per slot. That means everyday 700 people will visit these gardens. But this is something that we have to keep in mind because of the pandemic. We don’t want our visitors to face any problems,” she said.“This is a huge area where 100 people can visit easily in one slot whilst maintaining social distancing. It is always better to open up than keep shut,” Tiwari added.When asked whether there was a proposal to extend the number days for “Udyanotsav”, Tiwari said, “The flowers that we showcase here are season oriented. Plus this is the time when we used to open up and this year also we have lived up to this tradition even in these challenging times.”Among the major attractions at the Mughal Garden will be different types of roses like “American Heritage”, “First Prize”, “Kiss of Fire” and “Double Delight”, and bulbous flowers like “Narcissus”, “Dahlia”, “Sparaxis”, “Ranunculus”, “Hyacianth” and “Asiatic Lily”.The visitors can also see some rare types of roses such as the “Green Rose” with thin and long green petals, “Oklahoma” and “Bonne Nuit” with their almost black texture, and “Blue Moon” and “Lady X” with a definite blue hue.The garden is also adorned with multi-coloured pansies and Alyssum flowering plants.Visitors can enter Mughal Garden from gate number 35 of the President’s Estate which is close to North Avenue. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mughal-gardens-to-open-for-public-from-saturday-visitors-must-do-advance-online-booking-210975

The patient’s brain sends incorrect information to the muscles, causing involuntary, excessive muscle contractions making his/her hands twist into odd postures.A Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud asked the Centre to frame guidelines in three months to protect the rights of disabled students and enable them to write all competitive examinations with help of a scribe in tune with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016.The ruling came on a petition filed by Vikas Kumar, an MBBS graduate, who suffered from Writer’s Cramp and was denied a scribe by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) as the rules allowed only candidates with locomotor disability and cerebral palsy to have a scribe.“To confine the facility of a scribe only to those who have benchmark disabilities would be to deprive a class of persons of their statutorily recognised entitlements. To do so would be contrary to the plain terms as well as the object of the Act,” the top court said.The Bench said it was neither a largesse nor a privilege and the provision for a scribe was in tune with the mandate of the Disability Act to ensure that persons with disabilities were able to live a life of equality and dignity based on respect in society.The Centre had contended that it could be potentially misused.However, the top court said, “When competent persons with disabilities are unable to realise their full potential due to the barriers posed in their path, our society suffers, as much, if not more, as do the disabled people involved. In their blooming and blossoming, we all bloom and blossom.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-allows-scribe-for-candidates-suffering-from-writers-cramp-210968

11-02-2021||New Delhi||Anurag Thakur's remark kicks off row in RS||Union minister Anurag Thakur on Thursday kicked off a row in Rajya Sabha when he sought to extrapolate usage of the term ‘andolanjivi’ by a Congress MP for Mahatma Gandhi, to ask if the Father of the Nation was a "shariantkari" (conspirator).KC Venugopal of the Congress while participating in the discussion on Budget for 2021-22 referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's comment of 'andolanjivi' for farmers protest.Noting that the nation got freedom from the British through 'andolans' (protests), he said by that logic Mahatma Gandhi should have been the biggest 'andolanjivi'.Intervening in the debate soon after Venugopal finished speaking, Thakur said criticism was fine but "I had not expected that a Congress MP and office-bearer will call Mahatma Gandhi a shariantkari (conspirator). Nothing can be more unfortunate than that."Congress members immediately protested no one called Gandhi conspirator. They rushed into the well of the House demanding an apology from Thakur.Bhubanesar Kalita, who was in the chair, said he would examine the records and will expunge any word that is unparliamentary.But the Congress members were not satisfied and continued to protest.Amid protests, Thakur, who is Minister of State for Finance, continued to make his statement saying the Budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1 is one for new India which has made higher provisions for departments such as social justice and empowerment and women and child development.He went on to state that the Budget was for ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ which has been cheered by all as reflected in the stock market rising for days post its presentation.Kalita asked Congress members to go back to their seats but they continued to protest.He asked Thakur to conclude as the allocated time for the sitting of the House was getting over.Thakur who had begun speaking just a few minutes before the scheduled time was to end at 3 pm. As he finished, proceedings were adjourned for the day. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anurag-thakurs-remark-kicks-off-row-in-rs-210965

It specifically abolished/ scraps the one-year LL.M programme, duly approved by the UGC,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rules-scrapping-one-year-ll-m-programme-to-be-brought-into-force-from-2022-2023-bci-to-sc-210960
11-02-2021||New Delhi||Khalistani flag hoisting by SFJ: NIA files chargesheet against 6||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday filed a chargesheet against six people in connection with a case of hoisting the Khalistani flag by cadres of the outlawed Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) organisation on the eve of Independence Day in Punjab’s Moga, an official said.The US-based separatist group SFJ is banned by the government.On August 14, two miscreants hoisted a yellow-coloured flag with Khalistan written on it on the terrace of a four-storey building of the Deputy Commissioner’s Office Complex in Moga, according to an NIA spokesperson.They also cut the rope of the Indian flag hoisted near the main gate and dragged it along with the rope, the official said.The crime was committed by the miscreants at the behest of SFJ militant Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, who had offered them cash rewards, the NIA official said.The chargesheet was filed before a special NIA judge in Mohali under relevant sections of the IPC, the UAPA and the Prevention of Insult to National Honour Act against Inderjit Singh, Jaspal Singh, Akashdeep Singh, Jagwinder Singh, Pannu and Harpreet Singh.Inderjit Singh, Jaspal Singh and Akashdeep Singh are radicalised members of the SFJ, a proscribed unlawful association, and conspired with Pannu and Rana Singh of the SFJ, the NIA official said.In furtherance of the conspiracy, Inderjit Singh, Jaspal Singh and Akashdeep Singh were involved in hoisting the Khalistani flag at the DC Office Complex in Moga on August 14 last year and also tearing of the Indian national flag hoisted on the premises of the DC Office, the spokesperson said.They made video of the incident and sent it to SFJ’s Pannu and Rana Singh which was broadcasted by them on various social media platforms like YouTube, US Media International and SFJ Channel to propagate the secessionist agenda of the SFJ and in support of Referendum-2020 for making a separate state of Khalistan, the NIA official said.Pannu and Rana Singh have also sent funds through money transfer services to Inderjit Singh and Jaspal Singh after the commission of the crime, the official said.During investigation, various electronic devices like laptop, hard disc, mobile phones containing incriminating material were seized from the accused, establishing their strong involvement in the crime.Further investigation in the case is underway.

11-02-2021||Bhopal||Govt ready for talks, can amend farm laws if needed: Rajnath||The Union government is ready to discuss the new agriculture laws with farmers’ leaders with an open mind and even to amend them if necessary, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said here on Thursday.The new laws are aimed at doubling farmers’ income, Singh said, speaking at a function to inaugurate thousands of small-scale irrigation projects in Madhya Pradesh.Singh’s statement follows Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s fresh appeal to protesting farmers on Wednesday to come forward for talks and the assurance that the government is open to amending the laws if there are any shortcomings.“We are ready to talk with an open mind on farm laws and if needed even make amendments to them. As a result of our government’s decisions, a new confidence is being built among common farmers. And due to this (confidence) farmers have achieved a record production,” Singh said.“In 2017, the prime minister had vowed to double farmers’ income by 2022. This was not an easy resolve ....against the backdrop of this, the three farm laws were enacted last year,” he said.The new laws aim at fetching fair price for farmers’ produce and give them liberty to sell it wherever they wish, the Union minister further said.But “people with vested interests” created confusion over the three laws, spreading misconceptions such as markets run by Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees and Minimum Support Prices (MSP) will be abolished and farmers’ lands will be mortgaged, Singh alleged.The prime minister had stated categorically in Parliament that neither any APMC Mandi has closed after the new laws came into force, nor has the MSP regime ended, he said, adding that rather the MSP has increased.Under the new laws, agricultural produce will be up for sale and not the land, the Union minister stressed.Saying that Mahatma Gandhi considered villages as the soul of India, Singh said development of rural areas was the government’s priority. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-ready-for-talks-can-amend-farm-laws-if-needed-rajnath-210945
11-02-2021||Joshimath/New Delhi||First woman IPS officer who scaled South Pole, commando-trained officer leading ITBP ops in Uttarakhand||The rescue operation being undertaken at the Tapovan power tunnel in Uttarakhand is being led by the first woman ITBP officer to successfully scale the South Pole, and some other ace mountain-warfare trained officers of the border guarding force who have seen disasters in the hills up close.Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Aparna Kumar, a 2002-batch Indian Police Service officer of the Uttar Pradesh cadre, is the senior-most field officer of the force on the ground.Kumar, 45, who is the sector in-charge of the ITBP northern frontier based in Uttarakhand’s capital Dehradun, is well known as the first woman IPS and ITBP officer to successfully conquer the South Pole, the southernmost point on the globe situated in Antarctica, in 2019.The officer, who has two young children and hails from Karnataka, joined the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) in 2018 on deputation.She told PTI on phone from Joshimath that the “operation of clearing the slush in the Tapovan tunnel is continuing”.“It is a tough task but we are on it,” Kumar said.She had told reporters in 2019 that her first brush with mountaineering happened when she was commanding a Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) battalion in Uttar Pradesh some years ago.“I did my advanced mountaineering course in July, 2014 and since then there has been no looking back,” Kumar had said.She has also completed the prestigious seven summits’ challenge by scaling all the seven top peaks of the seven continents and was awarded the Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award by President Ram Nath Kovind in 2019.                 “Kumar has been camping in the Tapovan-Joshimath area since the tragedy struck on Sunday. She also leads the ITBP in various multi-agency meetings being held close to ground zero,” a senior ITBP officer said.The DIG is assisted by the Commanding Officer of the 1st ITBP battalion based in Joshimath (Chamoli district), Benudhar Nayak.Nayak, the officer said, has a rich profile as he has served for long in the mountains. He was posted in Uttarakhand when the massive flash floods that occurred in 2013. That stint is coming in handy to deal with the current tragedy, the officer said.Nayak was instrumental in quickly organising a team of over 400 personnel from his battalion and nearby units to launch the rescue operation after a possible glacier burst led to a flash flood in the Alaknanda river system and its fast swirling waters ravaged a number of villages in the border district of Chamoli and two hydro power plants.At least 35 bodies have been recovered till now while about 170 are still missing.The force has also put on job the personnel of its specialised mountaineering and ski institute located in Auli near Joshimath to undertake the operations.These combat-ready personnel are working under the command of Deputy Commandant Nitesh Sharma.“Sharma, a commando trained officer, was the one who first went into the small tunnel on Sunday from where 12 NTPC Tapovan workers were saved by the ITBP on Sunday,” another officer said.All these officers have been camping in the area since the day the tragedy struck and they are as eager to find success as the distraught family members of the about 30-35 men who are trapped inside the tunnel, the second officer said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-woman-ips-officer-who-scaled-south-pole-commando-trained-officer-leading-itbp-ops-in-uttarakhand-210943

11-02-2021||New Delhi||SC grants 4 weeks to Centre to reply to plea to declare ‘Guru Govind Singh’s Prakash Parv as holiday||The Supreme Court Thursday granted four more weeks to the Centre for filing its response to a plea seeking to declare as national holiday the birthday of “Guru Govind Singh Jee”, the tenth guru of Sikhs which is celebrated as the ‘prakash parv’.The top court on January 18 had issued notices to the Centre and all the states on the petition of ‘All India Shiromani Singh Sabha’ which has also sought directions to the authorities to issue “specific guidelines for declaration of public or gazetted holiday” in the country.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde was told by senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the ‘Sabha’, that the Central government has not filed its response.Attorney General K K Venugopal sought four weeks more for the Centre for filing the response which was allowed by the bench which also comprised justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Earlier, senior advocate Vikas Singh on January 18, had requested an early hearing of the plea so that the Guru Gobind Singh’s birthday is declared a national holiday from this year itself.The ‘prakash parv’ of the tenth Sikh Guru was celebrated on January 20.The petition sought appropriate directions to the Centre “to declare the Tenth Sikh Guru ‘Guru Govind Singh Jee’ Prakash Parv as Gazetted/Public Holiday to be observed all over India including but not restricted to the States/Union Territories of India in which the Sikhs have significant population as well as in the States which is connected to the life and activities of Tenth Sikh Guru ‘Guru Govind Singh Jee’.”The petition filed by advocate Durga Dutt said that “in the absence of any guiding principles of any authority regarding declaration of gazetted holiday in India, the executives at the behest of political groups who are in government, declare the holidays at their whims and fancies, serving the political purpose of appeasement of a particular section of the public.”“Because of the situation above, the important birth anniversary of tenth Sikh Guru “Guru Govind Singh Jee”, who is a great religious icon for significant Sikh community world wise as well as socio, nationalistic and patriotic figure for all Indians, has not yet been declared gazetted/public holiday in India, for which the petitioner in particular, is deeply aggrieved of,” the petition said.The plea sought to “enforce fundamental rights of equality before the law as regards the determination of a uniform non arbitrary policy for declaring any day as Gazetted/Public holiday in India”.It said a representation for declaring the Tenth Guru Govind Singh Jee Prakash Parv as Gazetted or Public holiday across the country was made to the Prime Minister on October 5, 2020.“The Petitioner is aggrieved of the decision of the Government, even in the aftermath of the representation dated 05.10.2020 of the petitioner, whereby no consideration even has been shown by the Government for declaring the holiday,” it said.

There was not much substance in the matter and the allegation had been made against him just for the purpose of harassment.” This is the second time that the actor has been freed from the allegation.                    Earlier, the court of the chief judicial magistrate had also absolved him of the charge, after which the state had challenged the decision in the district and sessions court. Khan had filed the affidavit in the court in 2003 stating that he had lost his arms licence.The prosecution had argued that he had submitted a false affidavit as his licence was not lost but submitted for renewal.“We argued that it was not intentional to submit this affidavit as Khan was a busy actor and had no exact idea about his licence at that time,” said Khan’s counsel H M Saraswat.He argued that if the accused has submitted a false affidavit by mistake, and he has no advantage of such an act, he should be forgiven and absolved from the allegations. Saraswat also presented some citations from the apex court in support of his arguments wherein the accused had been absolved of allegations of the submission of false affidavits or evidence in the court after admitting the mistake and tendering an apology.Though the public prosecutor contended that it was an act of misleading the court purposefully stating that Khan knew that his licence was not lost but Judge Kachhwal rejected his arguments and provided relief to Khan by absolving him of the allegation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/affidavit-on-arms-licence-court-rejects-plea-against-actor-salman-khan-210939
11-02-2021||New Delhi||Airlines permitted to fly only 80 pc of pre-COVID flights till March-end: Govt||The cap on the number of domestic flights that Indian airlines are permitted to operate will remain at 80 per cent of their pre-COVID levels till March 31 or till the summer schedule begins, said the Civil Aviation Ministry on Thursday.The ministry had set the 80 per cent limit on December 3, 2020, without specifying till what date it would remain in place.The summer schedule begins at the end of March for all the airlines. Aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) approves both the schedules — summer and winter — of all the airlines.“As per the prevailing situation of COVID-19, the Central government...directs the order dated December 3, 2020, shall remain in force till 2359 hrs on March 31, 2021 or till the date of commencement of summer schedule 2021, whichever is earlier or until further orders,” the ministry’s order said.The ministry had resumed scheduled domestic passenger services from May 25, 2020, after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus lockdown. However, the airlines were allowed to operate not more than 33 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights.On June 26, this was increased to 45 per cent and on September 2, it was further increased to 60 per cent. On November 11, it was increased to 70 per cent. On December, it was increased to 80 per cent. Scheduled international passenger traffic continues to remain suspended in India since March 23, 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.However, special international flights have been operating since July 2020 under air bubble arrangements formed with various countries. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/airlines-permitted-to-fly-only-80-pc-of-pre-covid-flights-till-march-end-govt-210934
11-02-2021||New Delhi||HC seeks Delhi govt, police stand on plea for SIT probe into death of farmer on Jan 26 tractor rally||The Delhi High Court on Thursday sought response of the AAP government and police on a plea seeking a court-monitored SIT probe into the death of a 25-year-old man who died after his tractor overturned during the protesting farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day.Justice Yogesh Khanna issued notice to the Delhi government, Delhi Police, Uttar Pradesh Police and the Chief Medical Officer of District Hospital at Rampur, where the post mortem was carried out.The court sought their stand on the petition moved by the deceased Navreet Singh’s grandfather who has claimed that the victim has suffered gunshot injuries to his head.The court directed the Delhi Police to file a status report with regard to the investigation on or before the next date of hearing on February 26.Delhi government standing counsel Rahul Mehra, appearing for the police, told the court that according to instructions received by him, Singh died as result of overturning of his tractor at ITO here during the violent clash between farmers and the police personnel.He said a general FIR in relation to Singh’s death has been registered at I P Estate police station.Advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for the victim’s grandfather, told the court that the way Delhi Police has conducted itself in the matter “does not inspire a shred of confidence”.She said that the police abandoned all procedures, like carrying out inquest proceedings, conducting a post mortem and lodging of an FIR, as required under the law, even if it was a case of accidental death.She said that the victim’s grandfather took the body back to their native place in Uttar Pradesh where the post mortem was carried out.The police, instead, seized all the CCTV footage from the area, including from cameras which were closest to the incident site, and only selectively released video recorded from far.It also released a statement to the media, on the evening of January 26, saying that the farmer died due to overturning of the tractor without even carrying out a probe, she told the court.Grover told the court that according to a UK-based pathologist, who saw the video of the incident and also perused the post mortem report, the injuries on the victim were consistent with at least one or two gunshot wounds.She argued that this indicated that the victim lost control of the tractor and it overturned as he was shot by the police personnel.The petition has sought directions to Delhi Police to share with the petitioner the CCTV footage recovered from the incident site.It has also sought directions to the UP police to share with the petitioner the FIR lodged there in connection with the death of the young farmer.A direction has also been sought to the Chief Medical Officer of District Hospital at Rampur to provide the petitioner with a copy of the victim’s x-ray report and also the video recording of the post mortem.“The petitioner’s grandson was lying in a critically injured condition under the overturned tractor, however, despite the presence of a large number of police men including senior police officials in the vicinity, no attempts were made by Delhi Police to provide immediate critical medical intervention to save the life of the petitioner’s grandson.“Instead, the Delhi Police resorted to tear gas shelling to prevent other protestors from reaching the site where the tractor lay with the petitioner’s grandson’s body underneath. No efforts were made by the Delhi Police to cordon off the site of the incident and to collect time sensitive material evidence from the site, which was allowed to be erased and destroyed,” the petition has claimed.

11-02-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court awards man 1 year jail term for visa fraud, says it impacts India’s image||A magistrate’s court recently awarded one year imprisonment to a man who was caught with a forged British Residence Permit at the international airport here, citing that such offences lower the country’s image and pose visa problems for intelligent students.Additional chief judicial magistrate (Andheri court) R R Khan on February 8 found Hardik Patel, a resident of Gujarat, guilty of offences committed under IPC sections 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 420 (cheating).In the detailed order made available on Thursday, the court observed, “Noticeably, the incident is in respect of deceiving the immigration authorities of two countries - India and the United Kingdom. The offences are serious.”                Due to such offences, job aspirants and intelligent students will not get visa and the image of the nation will be lowered, the court noted.These offences also have a diplomatic impact, it added.As per the prosecution, in 2010, an immigration officer at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport while checking Patel’s passport upon his arrival from London had certain doubts about the residence permit of Britain.Further examination revealed that the accused had gone to the UK on a student visa in 2007, which also allowed him to work for 20 hours a week.However, in 2008, his student visa expired, and he obtained a British Residence Permit from April 2008 to December 2009 by applying before the Home Office, it was stated.To get more time to work in the UK, Patel obtained another residence permit from December 2009 to November 2012 with the help of one Tejenderpal Singh Parmar and paid 3,000 British Pounds to a solicitor.The investigation officer informed the court the British High Commission was contacted for verification, and it officially confirmed that the residence permit (from December 2009 to November 2012) used by the accused was forged.The court while convicting Patel said the facts and circumstances of the case are self-indicative that the crime must have been committed in passion or obsession to earn money by overstaying in the UK.“Shockingly, the accused being highly educated preferred to give the amount to a private person for residence permit without following the due process of law,” it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-court-awards-man-1-year-jail-term-for-visa-fraud-says-it-impacts-indias-image-210930
11-02-2021|| Hyderabad||Telangana Rashtra Samithi bags both Mayor and Deputy Mayor slots in GMCH||In the first meeting of General House of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GMCH) on Thursday, Gadwal Vijaya Lakshmi was elected as the Mayor of Hyderabad.   Ever since the results were announced on December 6, people were speculating as who would take command of the GMCH body.Srilatha Reddy was elected as Deputy Mayor. Both belong to Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS).Lakshmi, who has been elected as the 17th Mayor of Hyderabad, is the daughter of TRS MP K. Keshava Rao—who is considered to be close to Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR). Lakshmi represents the Banjara Hills division, while the Deputy Mayor was elected as corporator from Taranaka division.  As the TRS did not have sufficient numbers, the Asaduddin Owaisi led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) supported the Mayor and the Deputy Mayor.In a House of 150, the TRS—on December 6—emerged as the single-largest party with 56 seats while BJP bagged 47 seats. AIMIM got 44 seats and the Congress Party managed to win only two seats.With 149 corporators in the House, and 32 ex-officio members, which totals to 181, voted to elect the new GMCH Mayor and Deputy Mayor.Earlier in the day, the directly elected ward members of GHMC took the oath at 11 am.On Friday, Telangana State Election Commission had directed the election authority, and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) Commissioner to conduct the election on February 11 at 12.30 pm. The State Election Commissioner (SEC) had notified the newly elected members (corporators) on January 16 to the council of GHMC. The notification paved the way for holding the first meeting of the newly elected members. The term of the existing council of GHMC expired on February 10. The process of conducting the first meeting of the new council, and election of Mayor and Deputy Mayor had to be completed by February 15.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-rashtra-samithi-bags-both-mayor-and-deputy-mayor-slots-in-gmch-210924

11-02-2021||New Delhi||Carbon emission cuts need to be 80 pc more ambitious to meet Paris Agreement targets: Study||Carbon emission cuts need to be about 80 per cent more ambitious to stay below 2 degree Celsius global warming—considered a threshold for climate stability and climate-related risks such as excessive heat, drought, extreme weather and sea level rise—a new study says.The scientists, including those from the University of Washington in the US, used statistical tools to re-evaluate the cuts in carbon emissions that would be needed  globally to stay below the 2 degree target proposed in the Paris Agreement international climate treaty.According to the study, published in the journal Communications Earth and Environment, an average of 1.8 per cent drop in emissions per year rather than the previously agreed 1 per cent per year, would be required to stay within the 2 degree threshold.“To have an even chance of staying below 2 degrees Celsius, the average rate of decline in emissions would need to increase from the 1 per cent per year needed to meet the nationally determined contributions, to 1.8 per cent per year,” the scientists wrote in the study.In the research, the scientists used the same statistical approach to model the three main drivers of human-produced greenhouse gases—national population, gross domestic product per person, and the amount of carbon emitted for each dollar of economic activity, known as carbon intensity.“A number of people have been saying, particularly in the past few years, that the emissions targets need to be more ambitious. We went beyond that to ask in a more precise way: How much more ambitious do they need to be?” said study lead author Adrian Raftery from the University of Washington in the US.The analysis revealed a range of likely future outcomes based on data and projections so far.Even with updated methods and five more years of data, the conclusion remained similar to the previous estimates: Meeting Paris Agreement targets would give only a 5 per cent probability of staying below 2 degrees Celsius warming.Since climate policies may not be targeting population growth or economic growth, the researchers calculated what change in the “carbon intensity” measure could likely be needed to meet the 2 degrees warming goal.They now believe increasing the overall targets to cut carbon emissions by an average of 1.8 per cent annually, as opposed to 1 per cent, and continuing on that path after the Paris Agreement expires in 2030, would give the planet a 50 per cent chance of staying below 2 degrees warming by 2100.“Achieving the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals is something we’re not on target to do now, but it wouldn’t take that much extra to do it,” said study first author Peiran Liu from the University of Washington.“Globally, the temperature goal requires an 80 per cent boost in the annual rate of emissions decline compared to the Paris Agreement, but if a country has finished most of its promised mitigation measures, then the extra decline required now will be smaller,” Liu said.The scientists also estimated how much more each country needed to increase its target—known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs)—in order to lower its emissions by 80 per cent. “For the largest emitters, the needed increases in the NDCs would be 7 per cent for China, 38 per cent for the US, 55 per cent for India, 49 per cent for Japan, and 25 per cent for Germany,” the scientists wrote in the study.They also suggested that countries increase their accountability by reviewing progress annually, rather than on the five-year, 10-year, or longer timescales included in many existing climate plans.“To some extent, the discourse around climate has been: ‘We have to completely change our lifestyles and everything,” Raftery said.“The idea from our work is that actually, what’s required is not easy, but it’s quantifiable. Reducing global emissions by 1.8 per cent per year is a goal that’s not astronomical,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/carbon-emission-cuts-need-to-be-80-pc-more-ambitious-to-meet-paris-agreement-targets-study-210920
11-02-2021||Mumbai||Now, US comic Trevor Noah puts India's farmer protest on global radar||Stand-up comic and late night show host Trevor Noah is the latest international personality from the entertainment industry to highlight the ongoing farmers agitation.Through his popular TV programme "The Daily Show", the Emmy-winning presenter on Wednesday night explained the origins of the farmers' protest, their demands and the subsequent global support the agitation has received.On February 2, a tweet by pop star Rihanna triggered a wave of support for the protesting farmers by a number of global personalities, activists and politicians."Why are India's farmers protesting? The government tried to change the decades-old agriculture laws and that's when the manure hit the fan," Noah tweeted, along with the video link.In the show's segment 'If you don't know, now you know', which ran over eight minutes, the 36-year-old South African comic pieced together news clippings to provide a holistic view of the protest.The video clip also mentioned the burning of effigies of Rihanna and Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg, who had voiced her support.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Delhi's borders since November demanding the repeal of three new agriculture laws that they say will end the minimum support price (MSP) based procurement of crops like wheat and paddy by the government and usher in big corporates into the farm sector.They have rejected the government's offer to suspend the reforms for 18 months and have not joined talks after 11 rounds of talks ended last month.Noah, who delivers satirical news related to the international and American political matters in an entertaining way on "The Daily Show", said the government has decided that they've had "enough" of the protest because this is "a major crackdown"."Maybe they think postponing the law will satisfy the farmers. But think about it. In 18 months, people will be in the same position that they are in now. And the protests will happen all over again...Why are India’s farmers protesting? The government tried to change the decades-old agriculture laws and that’s when the manure hit the fan.If you don’t know, now you know. pic.twitter.com/LGvM0WvbqS"But this crackdown shows you how worried the government must be about the protest. And honestly they should be, because it's clear that these farmers are digging in for the long haul," Noah said in the video.Meena Harris, an American lawyer and niece of US Vice President Kamala Harris, Hollywood veteran Susan Sarandon, actors John Cusack, Amanda Cerni, singers Jay Sean, Dr Zeus and former adult star Mia Khalifa have also lent their support to the protesting farmers.The government had criticised the tweets by Rihanna and other international celebrities, saying facts must be ascertained before people rushing to comment on the issue, calling it "neither accurate nor responsible". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/now-us-comic-trevor-noah-puts-indias-farmer-protest-on-global-radar-210917
11-02-2021||New Delhi||Study finds 20 per cent of India has toxic levels of arsenic in groundwater||Almost 20 per cent of India’s total land area has toxic levels of arsenic in its groundwater, exposing more than 250 million people across the country to the poisonous element, says a new IIT Kharagpur study which used artificial intelligence (AI)-based prediction modelling.According to the researchers, the findings suggest a much greater extent of the high arsenic zones and total population exposed than already known from arsenic sampling exercises and reports by various governmental and non-governmental organisations.The research, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, indicates the need for much more rigorous sampling of arsenic levels across India than what exists.Arsenic is highly toxic in its inorganic form, with long-term exposure to the element from drinking-water and food potentially causing cancer and skin lesions, among other disorders, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).The current study noted that these high arsenic areas are mostly located along the Indus-Ganga-Brahmaputra river basin and in pockets in Peninsular India.It said the states of Punjab (92 per cent), Bihar (70 per cent), West Bengal (69 per cent), Assam (48 per cent), Haryana (43 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (28 per cent), and Gujarat (24 per cent) show the highest areal extent of elevated groundwater arsenic zones.These are followed by sporadic occurrences in the states of Madhya Pradesh (9 per cent), Karnataka (8 per cent), Odisha (4 per cent), Maharashtra (1 per cent), and south-eastern part of Jammu & Kashmir (1 per cent), the researchers said.Apart from these, all other states are found to have negligible or mostly no arsenic hazard, they added.“A total of more than 250 million people are estimated to be exposed to high arsenic in India,” said Abhijit Mukherjee, Associate Professor at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, West Bengal.“Our study indicates a strong influence of irrigational abstraction (of groundwater) and regional geology on arsenic distribution patterns within India,” Mukherjee, the lead author of the study, told PTI.In the study, the scientists used advanced AI to model the occurrence of arsenic above its national permissible limit of 10 microgrammes per litre (µg/L) in the groundwater across India based on the various geologic, hydrogeologic and anthropogenic factors that have been known to control the groundwater arsenic distribution in the aquifers.Mukherjee said the study is the first integrated report on the field-sampled arsenic distribution patterns along with an arsenic prediction model using advanced AI across India.The researchers, including co-authors Soumyajt Sarkar and Madhumita Chakraborty, said they chose AI techniques to model the groundwater arsenic hazard across India since they suspected that a large part of arsenic-contaminated areas in India is still not sufficiently sampled.Therefore, they said, field-based analysis of arsenic distribution might yield a much lower arsenic hazard scenario across the country.“AI is being increasingly used in various domains of research for its exceptional computing power and ability to handle complex data, over traditional statistical models,” Mukherjee said.“For this study we have used an advanced AI model, namely Random Forest, which has been proven to be the most efficient in predicting groundwater arsenic in one of our previous studies,” he said.The researchers said India has been identified to be one of the worst affected countries by arsenic in groundwater, with a number of local to intermediate-scale studies confirming the contamination in West Bengal, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Punjab and Haryana.At present, over 80 per cent of the drinking water in India is sourced to groundwater and previous studies estimated about 90 million groundwater-dependent population in India is at risk of arsenic poisoning through direct and indirect consumption of arsenic-contaminated shallow tubewell waters, they said.Numerous studies in the past have tried to understand the patterns of occurrence of such arsenic-contaminated groundwater across India.However, the researchers said most of these studies are local-scaled and field-based, and are mostly limited to the Ganges river basin.They believe the findings from such studies will not be applicable for the rest of India.“Our AI model predicts pervasive arsenic contamination in major parts of the Himalayan mega-river Indus-Ganges-Brahmaputra basins, however it also occurs in several more-localised pockets, mostly related to ancient tectonic zones, igneous provinces, aquifers in modern delta and known sulphide mineralised mining regions,” said Mukherjee.The scientists said the model suggested arsenic-hazard potential in yet-undetected areas, adding that it is helpful in predicting hotspots in areas with limited measurements.According to the researchers, the outcome of the study is particularly important for policymakers and administrators as this knowledge can provide a vital input in identifying safe drinking water sources in arsenic affected areas of India. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/study-finds-20-per-cent-of-india-has-toxic-levels-of-arsenic-in-groundwater-210915

Law will take its own course and will be adhered to. I am trying to contact behan-beti (sister and daughter) Kangana. She won’t face any problem,” he said.Twitter had recently deleted some of Ranaut’s controversial tweets over the farmers’ protest. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-workers-threaten-protest-at-kangana-ranauts-shoot-madhya-pradesh-minister-vows-to-stop-them-210914
11-02-2021||New Delhi||Singhu border: Farmers improve facilities, infrastructure to prepare for prolonged protest||Installation of CCTV cameras for enhanced security, electric fans to beat the heat in the coming months and even a separate optical fibre line for Wi-Fi facility in case there is another internet shutdown at the protest site.These are some of the measures taken by the agitating farmers at the Singhu border to prepare for a long haul as a resolution of the stalemate over the new farm legislation seems unlikely anytime soon.The leaders of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, leading the protest, have reiterated to continue the agitation indefinitely till the Modi government scraps the three contentious farm laws and extends a legal guarantee of the minimum support price (MSP) for crops."We are strengthening our communication and other infrastructure to continue the agitation for a long period," said Deep Khatri associated with managing logistics at the Singhu Border protest site.To increase security measures and keep miscreants at bay, 100 CCTV cameras with digital video recorders are being installed at the main stage used by the Morcha and also at some identified spots across the protest site's stretch on the GT Karnal Road."We are also readying a control room behind the main stage for monitoring and keeping a tab on the happenings here as a lot of people come and go every day," Khatri said.Further, a team of 600 volunteers has been raised for patrolling the protest site, managing traffic and keeping a watch at night. These volunteers have been provided with easily identifiable green jackets and identity cards, he said.Work is also on to install large LCD screens at 10 vantage points, at a distance of 700-800 metres, to enable the protesting farmers to watch activities like speeches of the leaders from the main stage."We will also use these points as pit stops for ambulances and teams of volunteers to coordinate traffic management, patrolling and response in case of any emergency," Khatri said.In order to deal with any disruption in internet service as was done recently by the government, the Morcha is also hiring a separate optical fibre line for Wi-Fi facility, Khatri said.He said in view of the approaching summer, electric fans and air conditioners are also being installed at the main stage used by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha and other facilities are being strengthened there.The farmers protesting at Singhu asserted that they were ready to camp in protest for months and there was no dearth of people and resources to do so."We come from the culture of langar (community kitchen), so food is not a problem. Many farmers come here, stay for several days and go back to their villages to attend to their fields while others come and join us. This is going on and there is no lack of farmers' strength here," said Ranjit Singh from Moga in Punjab.Morcha leader Rakesh Tikait who is staging the protest at Delhi's Ghazipur border had on Wednesday said the farmers' agitation will be long-drawn, and it will spread across the country in the coming days.The farmers are protesting at Singhu, Ghazipur, Tikri border points of Delhi since November, demanding that the Centre scrap the new farm legislation.The stalemate over the farm laws continues as 11 rounds of talks between the Central government ministers and farmer leaders have failed to achieve any breakthrough.Tikait had on Wednesday said the government should talk to the farmer leaders to find a solution to the issues at hand. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/singhu-border-farmers-improve-facilities-infrastructure-to-prepare-for-prolonged-protest-210913
11-02-2021||New Delhi||No peace and tranquillity if there’s no status quo ante at LAC: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said there will be no peace and tranquillity if there is no status quo ante at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China.He also asked why the government is insulting the sacrifices of Indian soldiers.“No status quo ante = No peace and tranquility. Why is Government of India (GOI) insulting the sacrifice of our jawans and letting go of our territory?” he wrote on Twitter.The former Congress chief’s remarks came soon after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh made a statement in the Rajya Sabha, saying India and China have reached an agreement on disengagement in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh that mandates both sides to cease forward deployment of troops in a “phased, coordinated and verifiable” manner.Sharing details of the pact to defuse the tense military face-off in eastern Ladakh that severely strained the ties between the two Asian giants, Singh also assured the Upper House of Parliament that the country has not conceded anything in the sustained talks with China. India will not allow even an inch of its territory to be taken by anyone, he said.The defence minister said the implementation of the pact will “substantially restore” the situation to the one that existed prior to the standoff which erupted on May 5 last year, adding that the two sides have agreed that they should achieve complete disengagement at the “earliest” and abide fully by the bilateral agreements and protocols.Speaking in the Rajya Sabha a day after China announced the disengagement process, Singh said both sides have agreed to remove structures that were built since April last in the north and south bank areas of the Pangong lake, and put in place a temporary moratorium on military activities, including patrolling the traditional areas.

11-02-2021||Coochbehar (WB)||Bengal polls to be fought between Modi’s ‘vikas’ and Mamata’s ‘vinash’ models: Amit Shah||Branding West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee a “failed administrator”, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said the upcoming Assembly elections in the state will be a contest between Narendra Modi’s “development model” and her “destruction model”.He said the BJP’s ‘Parivartan Yatra’ is not for changing a chief minister, MLA or minister but ending infiltration and transforming West Bengal’s condition.Addressing a rally in this North Bengal town, he said the yatra is also aimed at ending corruption patronised by “bua-bhatija” combine. The BJP has been accusing Banerjee and her nephew Abhishek, the Lok Sabha MP from Diamond Harbour, of “institutionalising corruption”.He also spoke about the killing of BJP workers and warned that the perpetrators will be thrown behind bars.Claiming that Mamata Banerjee will not be the chief minister after May (by when the assembly elections will get over), Shah said she too would start chanting “Jai Shri Ram” by then.“This ‘Parivartan Yatra’ is not for changing a CM, MLA or a minister. It is for ending infiltration, it is for ending violence and building ‘Sonar Bangla’, it’s for the transformation of Bengal.“You vote the BJP to power in Bengal. Leave alone illegal immigrants, not even a bird from across the border will be allowed to enter the state,” Shah said addressing a rally before flagging off the fourth of the five ‘Parivartan Yatras’ planned by the BJP ahead of the assembly polls.Shah claimed large-scale infiltration into Coochbehar district, which shares border with Bangladesh, has caused significant changes in its demography.The upcoming assembly polls, he said, will be a fight between the “Vikas (development) model of the Narendra Modi government and Mamata Banerjee’s Vinash (destruction) model”.He asserted the BJP will bag more than 200 of the state’s 294 seats.“Mamata didi will lose election even only on the issue infiltration,” he said.Referring to the January 23 incident, when Banerjee declined to speak at an official event attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to observe Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s 125th birthday after ‘Jai Shri Ram’ chants greeted her, Shah said her stand was aimed at appeasing a particular community.“Such an environment has been created in Bengal that raising Jai Shri Ram slogan has become a crime. Why does she get angry after hearing Jai Shri Ram? Mamata Didi, if Jai Shri Ram is not chanted here, will it be chanted in Pakistan?” he said.“You get angry over it because you want to appease a particular section of people for vote bank politics. I am telling you (people) that by the time election ends Mamata didi will also start chanting Jai Shri Ram,” he said, mocking Banerjee.Listing out the names of some BJP workers allegedly killed in politial violence in the state, Shah alleged that the Mamata Banerjee government has created an environment of fear and panic, but the BJP is ready to take on the “goons” of the ruling TMC.“You think that we can get intimidated by the TMC goons? They cannot stall BJP’s march to power. Once we are in power, every perpetrator of violence that led to the killing of BJP workers will be thrown behind bars,” he asserted while claiming that TMC goons have so far killed more than 130 of its workers.Lashing out at “dynasty politics” in the TMC, Shah alleged that Banerjee has been working only for the welfare of her nephew instead of the masses.“The Modi government works for ‘jan kalyan’ (public welfare), while the Mamata Banerjee dispensation is bothered only about ‘bhatija kalyan’ (nephew’s welfare). Her only agenda is to make her nephew the chief minister,” he said.The BJP leader said Banerjee deprived people of the benefits of many central schemes and was always “quarrelling” with the Modi government.“The people of Bengal have made up their mind to elect a BJP government. At its very first cabinet meeting, the new BJP government will take a decision to transfer Rs 12,000 to the bank accounts of each farmer which they could not get as Mamata di refused to join the PM Kisan scheme,” he said.Reaching out to the Koch Rajbonshi community in North Bengal, Shah announced a new ‘Narayani Sena Battalion’ in central paramilitary forces and said its training centre will be named after ‘veer’ (brave) Chila Roy (a prince and younger brother of King Nara Narayan of Koch Dynasty).Reaching out to the Rajbongshis, who have a sizeable population in West Bengal’s Coochbehar and parts of Assam, he said a tourist circuit and Thakur Panchanan Memorial Centre will also be set up. Panchanan Burman is an icon of the community.Rajbonshi voters are a deciding in factor in many of the 56 Assembly seats of North Bengal.

He said that he, along with his aunt, managed to close it with great difficulty.Forest officials have set up two camera traps around the house, but have not managed to get any pictures of the animal so far, Thirunelli deputy range officer MV Jayaprasad told PTI."There are no pug marks of the animal, but the door has been damaged. Strands of tiger hair have also been found near the steps"."The tiger had come to the house. But, we do not know if it opened the door," the official said.

11-02-2021||New Delhi||Budget for the rich, of the rich, by the rich: Chidambaram||The Congress tore into the government in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday for presenting a “disappointing” budget, with former finance minister P Chidambaram describing it as a “budget for the rich, of the rich and by the rich” that is meant for only “one per cent of India’s population that controls 73 per cent of the country’s wealth”.Outrightly rejecting the budget for 2021-22, the senior Congress leader also lashed out at the ruling dispensation, charging it with “incompetent economic management”.Participating in a debate on the budget, Chidambaram said, “The subtext is, this is a budget for the rich, of the rich and by the rich... There is nothing for the poor people of India, who continue to suffer... This is a budget for those one per cent who control 73 per cent of India’s wealth.”         He said the government is in denial about the slowdown in the economy and believed that the problem in the economy is cyclical and not structural.“Two years of slowdown before the coronavirus is a reality,” he said.Chidambaram alleged that the country has witnessed three years of “incompetent economic mismanagement”.“The honourable finance minister took exception to my using the word incompetent. I cannot use a harsher word in Parliament. I am using the mildest word available to me. Three years of incompetent economic mismanagement means that at the end of 2020-21, we will be exactly where we were in 2017-18,” he said.Chidambaram said there is no demand in most parts of the country, including in developed states such as Tamil Nadu, and added that it was left to one’s imagination how backward states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha must be coping.“You have ignored the bulk of India. Who is this budget for?” he asked while saying that the incompetent management will undo the growth achieved and the borrowings will only be used to fill the huge craters in the economy.“Mark my words, the growth projections will fall short by the end of 2021,” the former finance minister asserted.He said the government projected a 14.8-per cent GDP growth rate and then said it will grow by 11 per cent.“Inflation next year will be at least five or six per cent... The arithmetic I have says your growth will only be 9.4 or 8.4...which is a natural and mechanical growth after the coronavirus-induced slowdown. Do not boast about the numbers. It will take you two-three years to get to a stable GDP. Take the advice of well-meaning critics, address the structural issue of the economy and support the poor. Do not go boasting about these numbers,” Chidambaram said.Asking the government to withdraw the budget, he said major numbers are suspect in this year’s budget.The total additional capital expenditure is Rs 51,000 crore, he pointed out and asked, “Where did the rest of the money go?”      “On the revenue side, your expenditure has increased by over Rs four lakh crore and a revenue shortfall of over Rs three lakh crore. Mark my words, the revenue projections for the next year are ambitious and there will be a shortfall,” the Congress leader said.Accusing the government of not spending enough on capital expenditure, he said, “The numbers will unravel and there is no excuse this year.”    Chidambaram said for the first time, there was no mention of defence in the budget speech while the allocation for health was reduced.Terming the text and speech of the budget as “prosaic and bureaucratic”, he demanded to know the pretext of the speech.“We have a pandemic. Let me tell you that we do not hold you responsible for the coronavirus nor hold you responsible for it leaving,” he said.Chidambaram said the Congress rejects the budget and added: “We must, therefore, record our strongest protest and dissent. And because of this dissent, we will be called ‘andolanjeevi’ and ‘parjeevi’.”            He urged the government to provide relief to people and migrant labourers by providing cash transfers and ration, else he warned that the poor will wake up and in a non-violent, peaceful manner, show what should be done.The Congress leader said the government has failed to stimulate demand for growth in the country and the GDP will go back to the figures of three years ago because of “incompetent economic mismanagement”.“Every economist in the world has said we have to stimulate demand and the best way to stimulate demand is to put money in the hands of people. This government has failed on that account. I repeat the charge. You are still not learning the lessons of the last 36 months. I am afraid that as a result of your not learning the lessons, another 12 months will be lost and the poor will suffer and suffer greatly,” he said.The former finance minister said the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in 2004-05, in constant prices, was about Rs 32.42 lakh crore and when the Congress-led UPA demitted office in 2013-14, it was a little more than three times at Rs 105 lakh crore.“Since then what has happened? In 2017-18, it was Rs 131 lakh crore. In 2018-19, it crept up to Rs 139 lakh crore. In 2019-20, it was a slower crawl to Rs 145 lakh crore and in 2020-21, the year that is about to end, the first half is about Rs 60 lakh crore and the year may end at about Rs 130 lakh crore, which means we are back to where we were in 2017-18,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/budget-for-the-rich-of-the-rich-by-the-rich-chidambaram-210886
11-02-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||India to renew engagements with Russia after cooling tensions with China||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 11Having reduced tensions with China after the simultaneous disengagement of troops began in Eastern Ladakh, India will renew its engagement with Russia that will culminate in a visit by Vladimir Putin for a summit meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sources have said.In the run-up to the summit, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla will visit Moscow, followed by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar co-chairing a meeting of a joint working group to consolidate the agenda for the Modi-Putin summit.Besides dealing with bilateral issues, the South Block is keen on multilateral initiatives with Russia. It will seek to put the India-Japan-Russia trilateral on a firmer footing with the unstated purpose of reducing the need for Moscow to seek China’s participation in the development of the vast Russian Far East rich in minerals and hydrocarbons.A trial run of the Vladivostok-Chennai sea corridor will be followed up by more substantial programs. India will also be looking to activate its $1 billion line-of-credit for the development of the Russian Far East.India is also poised to produce the Sputnik vaccine which could hit the markets by March-April, after regulatory approvals. India has already earned much diplomatic goodwill by despatching made-in-India vaccines far and wide. The commercial production of Sputnik will see India’s vaccine diplomacy extend its footprint to Central Asian and other countries.The year 2020 was the first in two decades when an India-Russia summit meeting was not held. Both sides put the onus for lack of substantial engagements on the COVID-19 pandemic though bilateral ties had briefly suffered an abrasion after the Foreign Office interpreted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s observations on the Indo-Pacific as patronising.“The two sides will also be looking to fine-tune the programme for military-technical cooperation for the next decade to tailor to India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat policy of joint development and production of military platforms. The attempt will be to agree on a joint production plan on the lines of manufacturing of Kamov and AK-203 rifles in India but more ambitious in nature,” said other sources.The Foreign Secretary will leave for Moscow after the Parliament Session is over while Jaishankar will conduct an across-the-board review of India-Russia relations with his Russian counterpart.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-renew-engagements-with-russia-after-cooling-tensions-with-china-210885
11-02-2021||New Delhi||Sex CD case: SC impleads Chhattisgarh govt as party in CBI plea for transfer of trial||The Supreme Court Thursday impleaded Chhattisgarh government as a party in the CBI plea seeking transfer of trial in the alleged sex CD case, in which Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel is an accused, outside the state.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R S Reddy allowed the application filed by co-accused Kailash Murarka saying that since several allegations have been made against the Chhattisgarh government, it will be appropriate if it is impleaded as a party in the case.During the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for CBI, said he has no objection if the state is made a party in the case.Senior advocate AM Singhvi and advocate Sumeer Sodhi, appearing for the state government, accepted the notice for impleadment in the matter.Senior advocate ANS Nadkarni, appearing for Murarka, said they want Chhattisgarh government to be impleaded as a party because there are several allegations against it and it would be better if the state replies to those averments. The bench allowed the application of impleadment and posted the matter for further hearing on March 5.  On January 18, the CBI had alleged in the top court that some of the witnesses in the case are being threatened and one of the accused is an influential person, the Chief Minister of the state. CBI had said that some of the witnesses are from Delhi, some from Bombay and some from other places and it would be better the case is transferred to one place outside the state.The top court had also taken up a plea filed by one Rasjeet Singh Khanuja, who claimed to be a witness in the CBI case, and said that he has been booked by the state government in some other case related to abetment to suicide. He also sought transfer of his case pertaining to abetment to suicide to the CBI. The state had opposed the plea of Khanuja and said that his plea filed under Article 32 of the Constitution needs to be dismissed.On October 21, 2019, the top court had stayed the criminal trial in the alleged sex CD case involving Baghel as an accused and sought his response on CBI’s plea to transfer the matter out of the state.The CBI has contended that it was seeking transfer of the case out of Chhattisgarh as two prosecution witnesses have complained to the probe agency that they have been threatened.It has said that for the sake of fair trial, the CBI has filed the plea seeking transfer of the case out of the state as the accused is now the Chief Minister and there are chances of the witnesses getting coerced.The CBI had registered a case in 2017 against Baghel, then Chhattisgarh Congress president, on a complaint that he had allegedly tried to frame the then state PWD minister and BJP leader Rajesh Munat in the fake sex CD case.Munat, the then Chhattisgarh PWD Minister in the Raman Singh cabinet and a BJP leader, had filed a complaint against Baghel and senior journalist Vinod Verma for allegedly tarnishing his image through a “fake” sex CD.In 2017, Chhattisgarh police had swooped down on journalist Verma’s house in Ghaziabad and had picked him up for conspiring with Baghel to allegedly tarnish the image of the BJP leader.The then state BJP government had transferred the case to the CBI which has filed the charge-sheet in the case. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sex-cd-case-sc-impleads-chhattisgarh-govt-as-party-in-cbi-plea-for-transfer-of-trial-210883

11-02-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Governor Koshyari denied permission to travel in state plane to Dehradun||Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari was scheduled to travel by a state government aircraft to Dehradun in Uttarakhand on Thursday, but the permission to use the plane was not granted even as the Governor had boarded the aircraft, sources said.The Governor later took a commercial flight to travel to Dehradun, a statement from the Raj Bhavan said.This comes amid uneasy ties between the state’s Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress coalition government and the governor, with both the sides have being critical of each other in the past.The Raj Bhavan statement said the Governor’s Secretariat had written to the government authorities seeking permission for the use of aircraft “well in advance” on February 2.The office of the chief minister was also informed about it, the statement said.When asked about the issue, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar told reporters here he had no clue and will be able to comment after gathering information.However, the opposition BJP in Maharashtra accused the state government of being “egoistic” and indulging in “childish acts”, and demanded an apology from the Shiv Sena- led dispensation over this.According to the Raj Bhavan statement, Koshyari is scheduled to preside over valedictory function of the 122nd Induction Training Programme of IAS officers at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration at Mussoorie in Uttarakhand on Friday.He was scheduled to depart from the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai for Dehradun at 10 am on Thursday, the statement said.Koshyari will travel to Mussoorie from Dehradun.“Today, on 11th February 2021, the Honble Governor reached the CSIM Airport at 1000 hrs and boarded the government plane. However, the Honble Governor was informed that the permission for the use of Government Aircraft had not been received,” the statement said.As directed by the governor, tickets for Dehradun were booked for the governor on a commercial aircraft leaving Mumbai at 12.15 pm immediately and accordingly, he left for Dehradun, it said.Earlier, a source told PTI, “Normally, governors do not wait for the permission to come. He sat in the aircraft.The pilot then said the permission was not given yet.”   When asked about this, Pawar said he had no clue.“I will take details on reaching the Mantralaya (state secretariat) and only then will be able to say anything,” the deputy chief minister said.Meanwhile, former Maharashtra minister and senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said the MVA government should apologise for “insulting” the governor.If the state government has purposefully denied permission, it is a “blot” on the state’s reputation, he said.“If this embarrassment is not intentional, then the state government should suspend the official who failed to issue the flying permission in time to the governor,” he said.The government should apologise and avoid further escalation of the issue, Mungantiwar said.BJP leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis accused the state government of being “egoistic” and indulging in “childish acts”.He also alleged that the state government has insulted the constitutional post of governor.“It is an unfortunate incident. Such an incident had never happened in the state earlier. Governor is not a person, it is a designation. People come and go, but the designation stays,” he said.The governor is the head of the state. In fact, it is the governor who appoints the chief minister and his cabinet, Fadnavis pointed out.“The government should understand that it is insulting a constitutional post,” he said.Notably, state Congress chief Nana Patole on Wednesday said the MVA government has decided to move court over the ‘delay’ by the governor in the appointment of nominated members to the Legislative Council.The state government recommended 12 names for appointment to the Council under the governor’s quota to Koshyari in the first week of November last year.However, Fadnavis on Wednesday said it was the governor’s prerogative to approve or reject names recommended by the state government.In October last year, during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, Koshyari wrote a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, asking if the latter had turned “secular” since he denied permission at that time to reopen temples in the state.The CM later said he does need a “Hindutva certificate” from anyone.During the pandemic last year, Koshyari also insisted on holding the final year exams of degree students in the state, but Thackeray at that time rejected the demand.

11-02-2021||United Nations||‘We count on India for its contribution to multilateralism as a force for good’, says UN Deputy Secretary-General||A top United Nations official has said that this year, more than ever, the international community counts on India for its contribution to multilateralism as a force for good - from COVID-19 vaccines to climate action and peacekeeping.UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed, addressing the inaugural session of the World Sustainable Development Summit 2021 Wednesday, hailed efforts by India to bolster its renewable energy basket and achieve its climate action goals.“India is currently the only G20 country that will overachieve the objectives of its nationally determined contributions. So much has been done already,” Mohammed said.“As India is seeking greater energy security through a revolution in solar, wind and energy storage, installing 450 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030 will bring more jobs, cleaner air and a more secure power grid,” she said.She underlined that India’s efforts provide a “template and a path” for others to follow, in particular through the international cooperation that this very institute represents.“This year, more than ever, we count on India for its contribution to multilateralism as a force for good — on COVID-19 vaccines, climate action and peacekeeping. Extreme weather and pathogens are transnational. Our solutions must be, as well,” she said.Mohammed began her address by expressing her condolences to the people and the government of India for the loss of life and damage caused by the glacier burst and flash flood in the northern state of Uttarakhand on Sunday.“Climate change is destabilising our world, and the consequences are often terrifying. My heart goes out to Uttarakhand,” she said, adding that such catastrophes remind nations of their global imperative to make peace with nature.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the World Sustainable Development Summit 2021 via video conferencing.The theme of the Summit, which is the flagship event of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), is ‘Redefining our common future: Safe and secure environment for all’.In his address, Modi said the road to fighting climate change is through climate justice.He added that India’s intent is supported by concrete action and powered by spirited public efforts, India is on track to exceed its commitments and targets from Paris.“We committed to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 33 to 35 per cent from 2005 levels. You would be happy to know that a drop of 24 per cent in the emission intensity has already been achieved.”             Modi underlined that India is ready to do whatever possible to further sustainable development. “Our human-centric approach could be a force multiplier for global good.”     The top UN official hailed India for being an “active, influential” player on climate change from the very beginning.She said that even before the Paris Agreement, India was acting “thoughtfully and strategically on its energy, environment and development priorities.”         “You have translated this strategic thinking into policies and programmes,” she said.She applauded Prime Minister Modi for standing “resolutely” with the 2015 Paris Agreement and launching two major environmental initiatives in the time since — the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure at the UN Climate Action Summit 2019 in New York and the International Solar Alliance, launched jointly with President of France during COP21 in Paris in 2015.“India is now poised to lead on the development of technologies that produce low-carbon steel and cement as co-leader with Sweden of the Leadership Group for Industry Transition. And I look forward to seeing the path you will chart to get to net-zero emissions and a climate-resilient economy by mid-century,” she said.Mohammed emphasised that these efforts have not just national, but regional and global impact.She expressed confidence that India can lead the way.“India can count on the full support of the United Nations. Our expertise and convening power at the global and country levels will maximise the impact of our partnership.”       The world is facing a “uniquely challenging moment” due to the global pandemic and less than a decade left to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, she said.Last year more than 100 nations committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, or in the case of China, before 2060. She described this as significant momentum as more than 70 per cent of the world economy and 65 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions are now committed to net zero.“But, this is not enough. The global coalition for net-zero emissions needs to grow, to cover the entire G20 and more than 90 per cent of the emissions.”        Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar told the Summit that India is leading from the front and implementing all its climate pledges well before time.Javadekar said India has reduced emission intensity and increased forest cover under the leadership of the Prime Minister.“Four international reports say that India, under Modi, is leading from the front and implementing all its pledges well before time. We have reduced emission intensity, increased forest cover and given a new target for the restoration of degraded land and 450-gigawatt target of renewable energy will be achieved. This is our country’s ethos,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-count-on-india-for-its-contribution-to-multilateralism-as-a-force-for-good-says-un-deputy-secretary-general-210868
11-02-2021||New Delhi||Amul chief says new farm laws are good, only doubts need to be put to rest||Communication, flexibility and adequate tweaking of the law to ensure that the big corporates do not reap the benefits and monopolise the situation are the need of the hour to end the impasse over the three farm laws, R.S, Sodhi, Managing Director of Amul said, adding that farm reforms are critical for the economy."Government's intention is good. These farm laws are good. But yes, there are some apprehensions, and they need to be removed," Sodhi said.Speaking exclusively to IndiaNarrative.com, Sodhi said that while farmers have demanded legal framework to continue the system to providing minimum support price (MSP), it has not brought any benefit to the agriculture sector.MSP HAS NOT YIELDED RESULTS"My views on MSP are totally different. Sectors such as milk, poultry, and fisheries do not have any MSP system. Yet they are growing. Those engaged in animal husbandry have seen 14 per cent growth in the last 10 years while in agriculture growth has been only 3 per cent," Sodhi said.The Amul boss added that MSP should be provided for agricultural items where production is not adequate. MSP should be determined on the basis of demand and supply, he added."If you keep giving MSP on products where production is surplus, for example, wheat, paddy sugarcane, then on one side you will have surplus production and on the other you will have deficit on other items such as pulses, where you need to give import substitution," Sodhi said, adding that farmers must be given the freedom to sell their produce anywhere they want.He pointed out that competiveness and supply chain have improved in the dairy segment which has players from all walks including cooperative, domestic private sector as well as multinational despite not getting MSP or other subsidies."In the milk industry, there are co-operatives, private players as well as MNCs—they are all competing. It is not possible for a handful to monopolise the market," he said.Incidentally, India is one of the leading producers of milk in the world, accounting for over 20 per cent of the global supply. India's milk production in 1991-92 was estimated at 55.6 million tonnes. In 2017-18, it was 176.3 million tonnes.Sodhi also said that the co-operative structure, which has carved out the success story in India's dairy segment, should be adopted for agriculture sector as well, which would then push the smaller farmers who often do not benefit from the government schemes.Sodhi added that the aim now should be to resolve the deadlock over the farm sector reforms. He said that both sides which essentially include the government and the farmers need to compromise while being flexible."The government has already agreed (on most issues) but now farmers also have to understand, they need to have faith in the government," he said.Farmers' organisations along with several other vested groups have come out in protest against three farm reform bills—The Farmers' Produce Trade And Commerce (Promotion And Facilitation) Bill, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill. These bills, aimed at creating a free market for sale of farm produce have faced stringent opposition from farmers across.Sodhi said that had the government brought in the laws "gradually" things may have worked out.ON FOOD INFLATIONSodhi said that while food inflation in India is considered a bane, higher food prices help in pushing farmers' incomes."My take on food inflation is very different…In India the effort is to always reduce food inflation so that the impact on urban India including those living below poverty line are not impacted but this has other implication. When you keep food items cheap, industry has to give low wages and the farmers suffer…If you reduce food inflation, you are also reducing farmers' income. So essentially, you have to see how to keep the balance and ensure that while the poor do not suffer, others pay higher food prices. After all farmers income has also to increase," he said. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amul-chief-says-new-farm-laws-are-good-only-doubts-need-to-be-put-to-rest-210864
11-02-2021||New Delhi||We value consensus, don’t believe in political untouchability: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted on Thursday that the BJP does not believe in political untouchability and values consensus in running the country, as he noted that his government has bestowed state honours on even the ruling party's political rivals to acknowledge their service to the nation.Addressing BJP MPs at an event here to mark the 53rd death anniversary of Deendayal Upadhyay, a party ideologue who had founded its progenitor Jana Sangh, Modi said the saffron party always put "rashtraneeti" above "rajneeti" and gives respect to even its political rivals.In this context, he said the current government has honoured former president and Congress stalwart Pranab Mukherjee with Bharat Ratna and noted that Padma awards were given to former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi and former Nagaland chief minister SC Jamir, both from the grand old party.Also read: Government has failed to stimulate demand: ChidambaramModi noted that he had said in Parliament that a government may run with majority but the nation runs with consensus.He also cited his government's tributes to national icons like Subhas Chandra Bose, BR Ambedkar and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and observed that any other dispensation would not have done it.Upadhyay's ideals of "antyodya" (empowering the most downtrodden) and integral humanism are the inspiration behind the government's welfare works and the "Aatmanirbhar Bharat" (self-reliant India) programme to boost the economy, the Prime Minister said, adding that India had followed the principle of "nation first" in its external policy as well, without being influenced by any pressure.He urged the BJP units across the country to undertake 75 works for social welfare as the country approaches its 75th year of independence.Modi also suggested to the party MPs and other leaders to make a list of products they use in their daily lives and see if they can get rid of foreign stuff and instead use their Indian alternatives.

11-02-2021||New Delhi||Archway to history: India Gate foundation stone laid 100 years ago by Duke of Connaught||The foundation stone of the All India War Memorial Arch in Delhi or India Gate as it is known today was laid on February 10 in 1921 by British royal Duke of Connaught during his visit to the country, according to old records.Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, was an uncle of King George V, the then reigning monarch of the British Empire who had held a grand durbar in Delhi in 1911, where he had also announced the shifting of the imperial capital from Calcutta to Delhi.Following this decision, work began on creating a new capital in the Raisina Hill area, the foundation stone of which was laid by King George V on December 15, 1911.Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker laid out an extraordinary new capital, with the Viceroy’s House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan) and the North Block and South Block fronting it, being the centrepiece of “New Delhi”, which was officially named so later in 1926.However, during the construction of the new imperial capital city, the World War I broke out and a large number of soldiers from the British Indian Army were sent to the war zones.The India Gate, a prominent tourist attraction today, is a solemn memorial to the soldiers from India who died in action and was originally called the All India War Memorial Arch.During the Delhi leg of his India visit in 1921, the Duke of Connaught participated in a number of activities and laid the foundation of the All India War Memorial on February 10 and the Council Chamber of the Parliament House, designed by Baker, two days later.According to a 1921 publication of the Superintendent Government Printing, Calcutta, units of the Army from across the country had gathered at the event in “New Delhi”, which was under construction.“On this spot, in the central vista of the capital of India, there will stand a Memorial Archway, designed to keep present in the thoughts of the generations that follow after, the glorious sacrifice of the officers and men of the Indian Army who fought and fell in the Great War,” the Duke of Connaught said in his speech.“The men were nobly led and the officers were bravely followed, and we give thanks to Almighty Providence that the cause for which they fought was the cause which prevailed, and that our memorial is not one of lives lost in vain, but a monument of great and overwhelming victory,” he said.The monumental sandstone arch, often compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, was opened after a decade.The 42-metre-high All India War Memorial Arch was built to honour the soldiers who died in the First World War (1914-1918) and the Third Anglo-Afghan War (1919). The landmark has the names of the soldiers inscribed on its surface.Over 80,000 Indians laid their lives in those campaigns and the India Gate bears the names of 13,516 etched over its surface.The Amar Jawan Jyoti was built to commemorate India’s victory in the Indo-Pak War of 1971, an Army official had said earlier.The Amar Jawan Jyoti is a memorial symbolised by an inverted bayonet and a soldier’s helmet over it with an eternal flame burning beside it. It was built in 1972 underneath the India Gate arch to commemorate the soldiers who lost their lives in the Indo-Pak War of 1971.Delhi’s iconic Connaught Place, a plush heritage shopping plaza built during the making of “New Delhi”, was named after the Duke of Connaught.

11-02-2021||New Delhi||Petrol price close to Rs 88-mark in Delhi; diesel near Rs 85-level in Mumbai||Petrol price in the national capital closed in on record Rs 88 per litre mark while diesel neared Rs 85 in Mumbai after rates across the country were hiked for the third day in a row on Thursday.Petrol price was increased by 25 paise per litre and diesel by 30 paise a litre, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.This took petrol price to an all-time high of Rs 87.85 a litre in Delhi and to Rs 94.36 in Mumbai.Diesel rates rose to Rs 78.03 per litre in the national capital and to an all-time high of Rs 84.94 in Mumbai.Rates vary from state to state depending on the local incidence of taxation (VAT) and freight.In three days, prices have gone up by 90 paise per litre each.Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Wednesday had told Parliament that the government was not considering a reduction in excise duty to cool rates from their record highs.Rates had risen as international oil prices touched $61 per barrel for the first time in more than a year on improving demand outlook amid the global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, he had said.Central and state taxes make up for over 61 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and about 56 per cent of diesel.Retail petrol rates have risen by Rs 18.26 per litre since mid-March 2020 after the government raised taxes by a record margin to mop up gains arising from fall in international oil prices. Diesel rates have gone up by Rs 15.74. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/petrol-price-close-to-rs-88-mark-in-delhi-diesel-near-rs-85-level-in-mumbai-210856

11-02-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||Ministry of External Affairs emphasises Trudeau's request to Modi for vaccines||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 11A glitch in vaccine imports that left parts of the country uncovered by inoculation compelled Canadian Prime Minister Justin Turdeau to call up PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday night despite a slight strain in ties due the farmers’ agitation.South Block capitalised on Trudeau having to fall back on India despite strained ties by only highlighting his request for the supply of vaccines. Moments before Trudeau made the phone call to Modi, the Canadian opposition had seized on the breaking down of the vaccine supply chain to embarrass the Trudeau government.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said Trudeau had also said if the world managed to conquer Covid, it would be also due to India’s tremendous pharmaceutical capacity, and Modi’s leadership in sharing this capacity with the world. “Modi thanked Trudeau for his sentiments,” added the statement.The Health Minister was pointedly asked by her rival shadow Health Minister if Canada was planning to approach India for emergency requisitioning of vaccines. The questioning was against the background of Ottawa’s strained diplomatic ties with India, first over supporting separatists and recently on the farmers’ agitation. The minister was non-committal but embarrassed after New Delhi let it be known that Trudeau had called up Modi seeking vaccines.Ottawa attempted to retrieve some of the ground by stating that Trudeau discussed many important issues, including the farmers’ protests.“The leaders discussed the two countries’ commitment to democratic principles, recent protests, and the importance of resolving issues through dialogue,” his office said in a statement.However, both New Delhi and Ottawa pointed to the several areas of convergence such as a free and open Indo-Pacific, climate change, global trade and reinforcing a rules-based international order.In December, Trudeau had earned New Delhi’s ire by stating that Canada would always be there to defend the rights of peaceful protests, and had expressed concern over the situation. The MEA had then summoned Canadian High Commissioner Nadir Patel and informed him that the Canadian PM’s comments were “unacceptable interference” in the country’s internal affairs and could have a "seriously damaging" impact on the bilateral ties.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ministry-of-external-affairs-emphasises-trudeaus-request-to-modi-for-vaccines-210854
11-02-2021||Washington||India-US defence and security ties stronger than ever before: Ambassador Sandhu||The India-US defence trade, which has grown significantly in a short span of time, now stands at $21 billion, India’s envoy here has said, asserting that the bilateral military and security ties were stronger than ever before.India’s ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu said India’s designation as a ‘Major Defense Partner’ and accordance of Strategic Trade Authorisation-1 Status by the US and the signing of the four foundational agreements with Washington will enhance military-to-military cooperation between the two countries.India has signed the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA); the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA); and the Industrial Security Annex and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) to facilitate mil-to-mil cooperation.“Our defence and security ties are stronger than ever before,” Sandhu told PTI in a recent interview.“Our defence exercises — in bilateral and plurilateral formats, have increased in frequency, scope and coverage. The recently concluded Exercise Malabar with the US, Japan and Australia has been yet another important initiative,” Sandhu said, responding to a question on India-US defence relationship at the start of the Biden administration.“Our defence trade has grown significantly in a short span of time and today stands at over $21 billion,” he said.Under the framework of the Defence Technology and Trade Initiative, launched during former president Barack Obama’s administration, the two countries had been working together for co-production and co-development of defence equipment, he added.“Our industries and innovators have been working together to chart-out trustworthy supply chains in next-gen defence technology, and to undertake joint R&D, manufacturing, innovation, and experimenting in new domains of cooperation,” Sandhu said.“We are closely working together to ensure a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific. Consistent with our shared strategic interests, we will continue to work together and further strengthen our defence and security partnership,” he said.Defence procurements from the US have been an area of remarkable growth in the last decade. India has procured around $18 billion worth of defence items from the US since 2008.India already has several US military platforms and equipment and many such proposals for new acquisitions are in the pipeline.The defence procurement activities are monitored through the Defence Production and Procurement Group (DPPG), the last meeting of which took place in Washington DC on June 7-9, 2018.According to a recent report by the Brookings Institute think-tank, the US defence and security relationship with India is a modest but important piece of the Biden administration’s wider Indo-Pacific agenda and one that will require steady investment and recalibration rather than major redesign.“Ultimately, the administration’s defence ambitions with India will only be realised if it works to rebuild a broader bilateral relationship that is not disproportionately dependent on defence and security ties; is disciplined about setting and resourcing its Indo-Pacific priorities; is realistic about India’s constraints; and is willing to invest in the high-level engagement at the leader and Cabinet levels to sustain an ambitious agenda,” the Brookings report said.The Brookings report argued that the US could do more to articulate its key priorities in engaging India on security issues: first, supporting India’s rise as a constructive global leader and counterweight to Chinese influence; second, limiting China’s ability to coerce India and other states in South Asia; and third, mitigating the risks, and enabling de-escalation, of inevitable India-Pakistan and India-China crises.It also makes a case for charting reasonably ambitious defence and security goals and avoiding crude conditionalities that would likely prove counterproductive.According to Benjamin Schwartz, former Director for India in the Office of the Secretary of Defence, former US President Donald Trump pushed defence trade with India and failed.“Biden’s team will push cooperation on COVID-19, climate change and regional diplomacy, and is likely to succeed in building defence trade despite the lack of prioritisation,” he told PTI.“The reason (is): Biden has hired the best people to work on the issue (Cara Abercrombie and Sumona Guha as White House Senior Directors for example) and created a functional government process,” he said.More and more Indian government officials recognised the value of tangible defence cooperation with the United States in managing the threats from Beijing, Schwartz said.“From intelligence sharing to combined planning to some level of joint operations, we can expect the US-Indian military relationship to continue growing,” he said.“However, technology transfer likely won’t be the area of greatest growth because India’s military relationship with Russia isn’t likely to diminish or be walled off in a manner that allows for the closest integration of Indian defence systems with those of the United States military,” Schwartz said.“The relationship would benefit from both sides focusing on areas of mutual interest that do not involve the most sensitive military technologies,” he said.

It got uncoupled near the Jogeshwari station," Western Railway's chief public relations officer Sumit Thakur said.Later, the coach was re-coupled with the train and it departed for further journey at 6.40 am, he said."No passenger was injured in the incident," he said.Earlier, the train had left from the Bandra Terminus at 5.10 am for its destination Ramnagar in Uttar Pradesh, another railway official said.It was supposed to reach Borivali station here at 5.33 am, but due to the incident, it arrived at 7.03 am, he said.Because of the incident, the suburban trains on the western line were running late by 10 to 15 minutes and the movement of several outstation trains was also affected, the official said."Due to technical issue at Jogeshwari station, all Up and Down suburban train services between Churchgate to Virar stations are running late by 10-15 minutes," the Western Railway's Divisional Railway Manager said on their official Twitter handle.

11-02-2021||---||Artfully crafted performance, says Tharoor on Modi’s emotional adieu to Azad||New Delhi, February 11Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s emotional adieu to Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday was a “well crafted performance”.Participating in a discussion on former Vice President Hamid Ansari’s autobiography published by Rupa, Tharoor commented on Prime Minister’s emotional breakdown in the Rajya Sabha saying “it was a very artfully crafted performance. It was partly in response to Rakesh Tikat’s tears that the Prime Minister decided he also has tears”.Tharoor’s response came on moderator Rajdeep Sardesai’s pointed question to whether he was actually calling the Prime Minister’s breakdown in the Rajya Sabha the other day a “performance”.“Yes,” insisted Tharoor, who, along with Sardesai, just got protection from arrest from the Supreme Court in a UP police FIR which had booked them both for criminal conspiracy and sedition over the Republic Day incidents.Both Sardesai and Tharoor had tweeted inaccurate details on the death of a farmer during the January 26 violence in New Delhi.Tharoor, on Wednesday, said politics in recent years “has narrowed the space for a Hamid Ansari kind of figure in Indian public life”.The discussion also saw former MP Pavan Verma ask former vice president Hamid Ansari and other panelists as to why the Khilafat movement for the establishment of a Caliphate needed to be backed at a time of Indian freedom movement, and also why the government did not touch personal laws of communities other than the Hindus after Independence.Verma posed another pointed query to Ansari: “Why did a secular Congress government overturn a modern Shah Bano judgment?”On the Shah Bano issue, Ansari said: “Politicians take decisions and you can examine them in hindsight.”The former vice president also defended the support for the Khilafat movement in the pre-Independence days, saying Mahatma Gandhi also supported the Khilafat movement.On Muslim law not being touched, Ansari seemed to disagree and said: “Every personal law was touched to the extent it suited political convenience.”Tharoor, also for his part, backed support for the Khilafat movement during the freedom struggle period and said Mahatma Gandhi used the movement for Muslim mobilisation during the freedom struggle, and none of the major leaders of that movement became communalised.“Jinnah, in fact, used to sneer at the Khilafat movement,” said Tharoor.Earlier, Ansari defended separate personal laws in India asking “Can marriage, divorce and inheritance laws being uniformed in the Indian society?”The panelists had gathered to discuss Ansari’s recent autobiography “By Many a Happy Accident: Recollections of a life”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/artfully-crafted-performance-says-tharoor-on-modis-emotional-adieu-to-azad-210845

The frequent consultations with India would ensure that the impact of the impending sanctions does not adversely affect India’s interests in the region.Currently, India is in the middle of several major initiatives with Myanmar such as transfer of military platforms, including a submarine, finishing touches to an India-refurbished port in Sittwe, a connecting road to Mizoram and a highway to Thailand, besides a large number of high impact community projects.With the UNSC unable to move towards a sanctions regime, US NSA Jake Sullivan has spoken of their inevitability by the Western block. At the same time, the State Department has made it clear the sanctions won’t be imposed without consultations with “likeminded allies and partners”.Like India, the Myanmar generals will also not like being sanctioned in a manner that pushes them to a situation where China becomes their sole option for trade and security, said the sources. Though the US administration has termed the February 1 regime change a coup, the generals have gone by the Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-in-middle-of-sub-transfer-building-communication-links-210713

Several government departments and ministries are also progressively opening accounts on Koo, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Aatmanirbhar Bharat" mission in mind.Twitter has pulled off 500 accounts out of 1,300 sought by the government and argued that the rest of the handles were not in conflict with the Indian laws.The Ministry of Electronics and IT today said it was surprising that Twitter published a public blog explaining its position about the objectionable accounts when it had already sought a meeting with the government and the Secretary, IT, was in the process of scheduling an appointment with Twitter.The government has sent three notices to Twitter to remove 1,300 accounts allegedly found to be peddling incendiary information around farmers' protests and R-Day events.

11-02-2021||New Delhi||Certain sections portraying Muslims as ‘others’: Ansari||Former Vice-President Hamid Ansari today said a concerted effort was on from certain quarters to regard the Muslims as “others”. He was speaking at a discussion on his recently released autobiography “By Many a Happy Accident: Recollections of a Life” organised virtually by the Centre for Policy Research.Attended by Congress leaders P Chidambaram and Shashi Tharoor, ex-MP Pavan Varma and former Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran, the discussion veered around nuances of secularism and Muslim identity. Chidambaram was the first to speak of “the vanishing class” of Muslim icons, such as Hamid Ansari, from public life. “I am not meeting enough Muslim people. I don’t find them. Are they being ostracised? Are they withdrawing?” he asked, accusing the BJP of targeting the Muslim identity.Ansari later said there was an effort by a section of people to treat Muslims as “others.” The former V-P said, “Yes I am pained because there is a concerted effort by some to regard Muslims as ‘others’. Am I a citizen or not? If I am a citizen, I have the right to be a beneficiary of all things that flow out of citizenship.”Noting that a plural society was a reality in India, Ansari recalled the 2015 episode where he was questioned for not saluting the Tricolour during Republic Day celebrations. Another time he was questioned by BJP’s Ram Madhav for skipping the Yoga Day event.“I know what protocol ettiquete is. I do yoga every morning. I was not invited to the Yoga Day event and I did not go to the function. When the PM is the chief guest, President and V-P are not invited. Those who primed for the controversies later apologised in some way or the other,” he said. Ansari defended separate personal laws in times when the ruling BJP is moving towards a uniform civil code. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/certain-sections-portraying-muslims-as-others-ansari-210716

However, the lawyers associated with the case and his kin allege that his arrest was not notified to his family neither had they been furnished with an FIR.‘Picked up due to assn with farmers’Shiv Kumar, who hails from Devru village in Sonepat, was picked up by the police for allegedly trying to “break into a factory in Kundli for illegal extortion under the garb of unpaid salaries of workers”. The lawyers and family claim that both Shiv and Nodeep were picked up due to their active association with the farmers’ protest.Shiv Kumar, who hails from Devru village in Sonepat, was picked by the police for allegedly trying to “break into a factory in Kundli for illegal extortion under the garb of unpaid salaries of workers”. The lawyers and family claim that both Shiv and Nodeep were picked up due to their active association with the farmers’ protest.“Shiv too has been arrested by the Haryana Police with Nodeep but he is not been allowed to see either his advocates or family,” said Vasu Kukreja, who is a part of the legal cell constituted by the farmer unions.“A close relative has alleged that he was being tortured in police custody. He is currently lodged in Sonepat jail. We are trying to reach out to him and get a ‘vakaltnama’ signed so that we can proceed,” Kukreja added.Sahil, Shiv’s cousin, said Shiv was detained illegally and was sent on remand without the knowledge of the family.“As per information, he was picked up on January 16 and has been kept in custody since then. The family got to know about his arrest only on January 30,” Sahil said.However, Sonepat SP JS Randhawa refuted the allegations saying Shiv Kumar was picked up for violence at the Kundli factory.“It has been clearly stated (in the FIR) that there were around 40 to 50 so-called activists, who I will like to call as anti-social elements. They were harassing local industrial unit’s management,” Randhawa told The Tribune.“The local police were called, who were then attacked, and Shiv was arrested in the same case. We have the CCTV footage of the incident as well,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-notified-about-activist-shiv-kumars-arrest-alongside-nodeep-kaur-kin-210737

He urged the agitating farmers to come forward for discussions.Speaking in the Lok Sabha during the motion of thanks on the President’s Address amid disruptions by Opposition MPs, the PM defended the farm laws, saying these were enacted to meet new challenges in the agriculture sector.Reaching out to agitating farmers, the PM said the government and Parliament had great respect for those voicing views on the three farm laws, which was why topmost ministers had been talking to them. Allayed apprehensions, he said neither any “mandi” had shut down nor had the MSP stopped, rather the MSP had been hiked.The PM said differentiation would have to be made between “‘andolankaaris” and “andolanjeevis”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-parliament-have-respect-for-farmers-pm-in-lok-sabha-210717

So far 55 metre length of the tunnel has been cleared of slush, which has been hampering rescue efforts even as families of those missing held a protest at Joshimath today to question “inordinate delay in breaching the tunnel”.Edit: Outrage in Lahaul-SpitiThe Uttarakhand administration said 32 bodies had been recovered so far and eight identified.The estimation of those missing has gone up from 166 yesterday to 172 today after multiagency teams, which used drones and remote-sensing equipment at the site, pointed to new locations where bodies could be buried under slush.At Tapovan, rescuers told The Tribune that the two JCB loaders deployed to clear the tunnel could break down any time now. There were no replacements available yet.Further, the water level inside the tunnel is constantly surging. Families of missing workers of the Rishiganga hydel project site protested accusing the authorities of not carrying out rescue operations properly.

In this light, a blog post published prior to it is unusual,” the IT Ministry said in its response on Koo, a homegrown social networking platform.Twitter was asked by the government to block 1,178 accounts. The company said the orders were inconsistent with Indian law and for some accounts, it would restrict access within India instead of an outright ban.Read also:Ready for dialogue"Our objective is not change in power (at the Centre).

However, those with a contrary point of view said “not much should be read into warm-hearted respect accorded to a senior Opposition leader and the next CM of J&K is expected to be from Jammu”.Though if read with the PM’s reply to the debate on the President’s address in the Rajya Sabha, some dots can be connected. A day before, Modi had drawn attention to Azad’s easy manner and his comments on J&K and recent DDC/local polls.BJP leaders are all praise for Azad “who wants the situation to improve in the Valley”. At 71 years, Azad has a few years before he hits the BJP’s unofficial date of retirement from politics (75 years). PDP’s Nazir Ahmed Laway said he hoped that a Bill would be brought in Parliament soon to make J&K a state again. “The PM and the Home Minister have promised in this House that J&K will become a state again. I am confident that a Bill to this effect will be soon brought to the House,” he said. Another outgoing PDP MP Mir Mohammed Fayaz appealed to the PM and the Home Minister to make J&K one state again and restore its special status.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/speculation-rife-on-govt-office-for-ghulam-nabi-azad-210723

Some 50,000 troops on either side have been facing each other along the 823-km-long LAC.While India is yet to make an official statement on the matter, Chinese defence ministry website ran a statement by its spokesperson Colonel Wu Qian today. “Chinese and Indian frontline troops at the southern and northern bank of the Pangong Tso lake start synchronised and organised disengagement from February 10,” he stated.Top sources in the Indian security establishment have said that “this will be part of a gradual step-wise disengagement process”.Tanks and mechanised equipment of both sides have been pulled back from locations south of the Pangong Tso, the sources said. Since August-end, troops of both sides have been within rifle-shot range of each other in the Rinchen La and Rezang La areas on the south bank of the Pangong Tso following a clash.On the north bank of the lake – which has a more rugged terrain – both sides have begun the process of thinning out troops.The pullback shall be physically verified before the next disengagement step is undertaken, said the sources, as they recalled the Galwan clash on June 15 which occurred after the first phase of pullback had been initiated. So far, only tanks and mechanised equipment have been withdrawn from the south bank of the lake. On the north bank, the number of infantry troops is being reduced.A decision on the disengagement had been announced on January 25 in a joint statement following the 9th round of India-China corps commander-level meeting conducted on January 24. “The two sides had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on disengagement along the LAC… (and) agreed to push for an early disengagement of the frontline troops,” the joint statement read.Epicentre of tensions between two sides50,000 troops on either side have been facing each other along the 823-km-long LAC. Since August-end, both armies have been within rifle-shot range of each other in the south bank of Pangong Tso following a clash.Permanent UN seat: China harps on ‘package solution’Beijing: China, which has been blocking India’s efforts to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council, on Wednesday called for evolving a “package solution” that is acceptable to all to reform the top organ of the global body.

11-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||Both public, private sectors important for growth: Modi||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 10Prime Minister Narendra Modi today talked of taking India forward in the post-Corona period through self-reliance. Accusing "andolanjeevis" of exploiting the "pavitra andolan" (sacred agitation) of farmers, he mocked the Congress for being a "divided and confused house". He slammed the Opposition for "planning strategic disruptions" and urged agitating farmers to come forward for discussions.Referring to the criticism of "corporate" takeover, he said: "If public sector is important for the country, so is the private sector as wealth creators are important for wealth to be distributed."He said the government and Parliament had great respect for those voicing views on the three farm laws, which was why topmost ministers had been talking to them. Allaying apprehensions, he said neither any 'mandi' had shut down nor had the MSP stopped, rather the MSP had been increased.Amid protests by Opposition MPs, the PM said the laws were important for the nation's progress. "No one asked for laws against dowry, triple talaq… but these laws were enacted because these were progressive," he said."It cannot be status quo anymore," he said, pointing to the increasing number of landless labourers and agriculture becoming unremunerative. "This is disturbing because it means that there is not adequate investment in the sector. Farmers also need to diversify towards more paying crops," he said.Defending the three farm laws, the PM said they had been enacted in line with the need of the time to meet new challenges in the agriculture sector. "Countries are not run on status quo and leaders will have to take responsibility for desired change," he said, speaking in the Lok Sabha during the motion of thanks on the President's address amid disruptions by Opposition MPs.The PM said differentiation would have to be made between "andolankaaris" and "andolanjeevis". "Kisan andolan is "pavitra" (sacred/pure) but when 'andolanjeevis' use it to further their interest, showcase photos of those jailed for serious offences like terrorism, does it serve any purpose? Not allowing toll plazas to function....destroying thousands of telecom towers in Punjab, is it 'pavitra bhavna'," he said.The PM said India has to be "atmanirbhar" to cement its place in the post-Corona period. "The credit for dealing with the fear of unknown goes to the discipline of 130 crore Indians. India not only overcame the crisis to become self-reliant but also helped other countries,” he said. Taking a swipe at Congress' Punjab MP Manish Tewari who had attributed India's tapering figures to "God's grace", the PM said he agreed with the observation. "It is because India's frontline healthworkers, doctors and nurses, 'safai karamcharis' and ambulance drivers saved us," he said.The PM said those disrupting the House were doing so "as per a well-planned strategy as they are unable to digest that people can see the truth". Taking a dig at the Congress, he said "the condition of the party had now become such that its Rajya Sabha unit moved in one direction while the Lok Sabha unit moved in the other”. "Nothing can be more unfortunate than this. The Congress is also there in the Rajya Sabha, their senior leaders debate with enthusiasm. On the other hand, there is the other section of the Congress (in LS)," the PM said as the Congress staged a walkout along with the TMC while he was speaking.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/both-public-private-sectors-important-for-growth-modi-210728

11-02-2021||Ghazipur||A school for ragpickers, poor bringing a lot of cheer in Ghazipur||Mata Savitribai Phule Mahasabha (MSPM) tent is attracting a lot of attention from the crowd in Ghazipur.Over 30 children, mostly rag pickers and children of guards from the nearby colonies and a few from farming families sitting in protest are making a big ruckus as they repeat numbers and alphabets in chorus.The noise quotient is bringing a number of curious onlookers to the tent. The Savitribai Phule Pathshala has been running at the Ghazipur protest site since January 22.The pupils — their numbers fluctuate from 30 to 60 daily — started off with a great difficulty as the Andolan Committee weren’t keen on having a school at a protest site.The indifference notwithstanding, the school is not only prospering, it is bringing a lot of change in the lifestyle of these young students in terms of their keenness to learn and also towards their personal hygiene. “Initially we couldn’t see the colours on their clothes. They were all covered in dirt,” said Nirdhesh Singh, who runs the school along with three other teachers. “Now they have all started to work towards cleanliness and personal hygiene. Nowadays they troop in well before the start of the school,” Singh, who had to initially lure these children with candies and other treats to bring them anywhere near a white board, said. “Madam I haven’t got my notebook yet. You have to give me two books as well,” Shabbo, who is seven, asked Limdevi Maurya, who took the class on Tuesday. Karthik, 10, whose father is a guard in the nearby Gaursons apartment, was in attendance.Kunal Pradhan, 8, a student of Balvidya Public School, said, “Sir mera school lockdown se band hai, isliye aata hun (my school is shut since lockdown that’s why I come).” Young Jamshed, whose father Jawaid is a rickshaw puller, has been a regular attendant.“Bahut accha lagta hai (It feels really good),” he says.Nirdhesh, who is also the national president of MSPM, said the organisation works for the poor and downtrodden in Uttar Pradesh and when they joined the protest only then this idea of running a school came about.“We run a campaign for de-addiction and suggest to take up education to prosper,” she explained.“Nobody is bothered about the lifestyle of poor. So it was important for us to show these children that they are also a part of our society. And that’s how this school came into being,” she added.Besides pupils, the school has also started to attract attention of teachers like Limdevi, who has travelled all the way to the protest site from Bastar, Chhattisgarh.“I came here yesterday,” Maurya said.“Today was my first day. I enjoyed it thoroughly. And it helped that these children already know the numbers and alphabets,” she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-school-for-ragpickers-poor-bringing-a-lot-of-cheer-in-ghazipur-210525

11-02-2021||Beijing/New Delhi||Chinese, Indian troops start ‘synchronised’ disengagement in eastern Ladakh: China’s Defence Ministry||The frontline troops of China and India at the south and north banks of the Pangong Lake in eastern Ladakh started “synchronised and organised” disengagement from Wednesday, the Chinese defence ministry said, in what is seen as a forward movement in the overall disengagement process to defuse the over nine-month border standoff.There was no official comment by either the Indian defence ministry or the Indian Army on the Chinese statement but people familiar with the development said both sides are in the process of pulling back their armoured units like tanks and armoured personnel carriers.The people mentioned above said specific steps like the withdrawal of armoured elements from the friction points were discussed threadbare at the ninth round of high-level military talks on January 24 that lasted for around 16 hours.The office of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, meanwhile, tweeted that he will make a statement in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday on the situation in eastern Ladakh.“Raksha Mantri Shri @rajnathsingh will make a statement in Rajya Sabha tomorrow regarding ‘Present Situation in Eastern Ladakh’,” it said.Also read: Rajnath Singh likely to make a statement on LAC issue in Parliament on ThursdayAuthoritative sources in the Indian defence and military establishment did not refute the Chinese defence ministry’s statement on the developments in the northern and southern banks of Pangong lake, an area that witnessed major face-offs since the row erupted on May 5.People familiar with the situation in eastern Ladakh said both sides are in the process of pulling back their armoured units in line with steps agreed upon for overall disengagement in the last round of military talks, adding a clear picture will emerge soon.“The Chinese and Indian frontline troops at the southern and northern bank of the Pangong Tso Lake start synchronised and organised disengagement from February 10,” spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of National Defence Senior Colonel Wu Qian said in a brief statement in Beijing. The statement did not provide details.“This move is in accordance with the consensus reached by both sides at the 9th round of China-India Corps Commander Level Meeting,” it said.Separately, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the frontline troops of the Chinese and Indian militaries began to conduct simultaneous and planned disengagement in the Pangong Lake area on Wednesday as per consensus reached at a meeting of the foreign ministers of the two countries in Moscow in September and the ninth round of Corps commander-level talks.“We hope the Indian side will work with China to meet each other halfway, strictly implement the consensus reached between the two sides and ensure the smooth implementation of the disengagement process,” Wang Wenbin said in a statement.“This move is in accordance with the consensus reached by both sides at the 9th round of China-India Corps Commander Level Meeting,” the official added.A source in the Indian military and defence establishment said there has been some “forward movements” but at the same time added that India will only go by what is happening on the ground.“The Chinese and Indian frontline troops at the southern and northern bank of the Pangong Tso Lake start synchronised and organised disengagement from February 10”Both sides rushed a large number of battle tanks, armoured vehicles and heavy equipment to the treacherous and high-altitude areas of the region after tension escalated following a deadly clash in the Galwan Valley in June last.Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the fierce hand-to-hand combat on June 15 in Galwan Valley, an incident that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in decades.China is yet to disclose the number of its soldiers killed and injured in the clash though it officially admitted to have suffered casualties. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.At their ninth round of military talks, the Indian and Chinese armies agreed to push for an “early disengagement” of troops and resolved to continue “effective efforts” to stabilise and control the situation in eastern Ladakh.“The two sides agreed to continue their effective efforts in ensuring the restraint of the frontline troops, stabilise and control the situation along the Line of Actual Control in the Western Sector of the China-India border, and jointly maintain peace and tranquillity,” said a joint statement after the talks.Close to 100,000 Indian and Chinese troops are deployed in eastern Ladakh amid continuing diplomatic and military talks to find an amicable solution to the standoff.Last month, Army chief Gen MM Naravane said Indian troops will hold their ground as long as it takes to achieve the “national goals and objectives”.In December last, India and China held another round of diplomatic talks on the border row under the framework of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China border affairs.Following the sixth round of military talks, the two sides had announced a slew of decisions including not to send more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoid taking any actions that may further complicate matters.This round was held with a specific agenda of exploring ways to implement a five-point agreement reached between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) conclave.The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.

11-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||Neither has any ‘mandi’ shut nor has MSP stopped, says PM Modi; Cong, TMC stage walkout||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 10Prime Minister Narendra Modi on talked of taking India forward in the new world order in the post-Corona period through self-reliance, accused ‘andolanjeevis’ of exploiting the ‘pavitra andolan’ (sacred agitation) of farmers, mocked the Congress for being a “divided and confused house”, slammed the Opposition for “planning strategic disruptions” and once again urged agitating farmers to come forward for discussions.Defending the three farm laws, the PM said they had been enacted in line with the need of the times, to meet new challenges in the agriculture sector. Countries are not run on status quo and leaders will have to take responsibility for desired change, he said, speaking in the Lok Sabha during the motion of thanks on the President’s address amid disruptions by Opposition MPs.The PM said differentiation will have to be made between ‘andolankaaris’ and ‘andolanjeevis’.Read also: Farmers to hold ‘rail roko’ protest on Feb 18 from 12 pm to 4 pm across India“Kisan andolan is “pavitra” (pure) but when ‘andolanjeevis’ use it to further their interest, showcase photos of those jailed for serious offences like terrorism, does it serve any purpose? Not allowing toll plazas to function...destroying thousands of telecom towers in Punjab, is it ‘pavitra bhavna’,” he questioned.The PM said India has to be “atmanirbhar” to cement her place in the post-Corona period.“The credit for dealing with the fear of unknown goes to the discipline of 130 crore Indians. India not only overcame the crisis to become self-reliant but also helped other countries”. Taking a swipe at Congress’ Punjab MP Manish Tewari who had attributed India’s tapering figures to “God’s grace”, the PM said he agree with the observation. “It is because India’s front-line health workers, doctors and nurses, ‘safai karamcharis’ and ambulance drivers became the ‘roop’ (incarnation) of ‘bhagwaan’ (God) and saved us,” Modi said.Asserting that the government is ready to accept farmers' logical suggestions, PM said provisions in the laws are “optional and not compulsory” and that old system will continue. "Rumours are being spread that these laws are against farmers," he said. "I want to ask if any farmer has faced any change after the laws were implemented," he said, adding that provisions in the new laws are "optional" and "nothing is compulsory". Old ‘mandis’ have not stopped, on the contrary they are being modernised, he said. Amid protests by Opposition MPs, the PM said the laws are important for the nation’s progress. “No one asked for laws against dowry, triple talaq… but these laws were enacted because they were progressive. No one asked for Ayushmaan Bharat, Swachch Bharat or Jan Dhan Yojana but they were implemented,” he said questioning the oft-repeated argument that no-one had “asked” for the three farm laws so why they were implemented.It cannot be status quo anymore, he said, pointing to the increasing number of landless labourers and agriculture becoming unremunerative. “This is disturbing because it means that there are not adequate investments in the sector,” he said asserting for more investments to boost employment in the sector. Farmers also need to diversify towards more paying crops, he said. Apparently referring to this criticisms of “corporate” take-over he said “if public sector is important for the country so is private sector” as wealth creators are important for wealth to be distributed.Reaching out to agitating farmers, he said the Government and the Parliament have great respect for those voicing views on the three farm bills, which is why topmost ministers have been talking to them. Allayed apprehensions, he said neither any ‘mandi’ has shut down nor has the MSP stopped, rather the MSP has increased.The PM said those disrupting the House are doing so “as per a well-planned strategy as they are unable to digest that people can see the truth”. In a sharp dig at the Congress, he said “the condition of the Congress party, a very old party which ruled the country for about six decades, has now become such that its Rajya Sabha unit moves in one direction while the Lok Sabha unit moves in another direction”. “Nothing can be more unfortunate than this. The Congress is also there in Rajya Sabha. Their senior leaders debate with a lot of enthusiasm and express their views. On the other hand, there is the other section of the Congress (in Lok Sabha),” the PM said as the Congress staged a walkout along with the TMC while he was speaking.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/neither-has-any-mandi-shut-nor-has-msp-stopped-says-pm-modi-cong-tmc-stage-walkout-210480

In a statement, the human rights body, which shut shop in India in September last year, also called for the immediate and unconditional release of those arrested solely for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression.The Indian government must immediately stop its escalating crackdown on protesters, farming leaders and journalists, amid ongoing nationwide demonstrations against three recently introduced farm laws. https://t.co/fZg5l0wxQf  It highlighted the case of Mandeep Punia, a freelance journalist for The Caravan, who was initially accused of obstructing the police and then of violence. Punia was detained for an initial period of 14 days without being allowed to see a lawyer but was later granted bail.It regretted that rather than investigating reports of violence against protesters and bringing suspected perpetrators to justice, the authorities hindered access to protest sites and censored social media.Also read: The Government had frozen Amnesty’s bank accounts for alleged violation of foreign exchange laws while the group said it was forced to withdraw from India due to “continuing crackdown” and “harassment”.In its latest statement, Amnesty said the crackdown on those protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act still hasn’t ended, while new efforts to quell the anti-farm legislation protests have taken shape.The UN Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights had on February 5 called on the Center and protesters to exercise “maximum restraint” and asked the Government should protect the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amnesty-international-decries-crackdown-on-supporters-of-farmers-protests-210407

11-02-2021||New Delhi||Farmers’ agitation: Twitter suspends over 500 accounts after govt order||Twitter on Wednesday said it has suspended over 500 accounts, and blocked access to several others within India as it partly acceded to a government order to curb spread of misinformation and inflammatory content around farmers’ protests.Twitter, in a blogpost, said it has not blocked accounts consisting of “news media entities, journalists, activists and politicians” as doing so “would violate their fundamental right to free expression” guaranteed under the country’s law.The government, however, termed as “unusual” Twitter’s move to publish the blogpost before a slated talks with the IT Secretary on the issue, as sought by the US company.“Upon the request of Twitter seeking a meeting with the government, the Secretary IT was to engage with senior management of Twitter. In this light, a blog post published prior to this engagement is unusual,” IT Ministry said in its response on Koo, a homegrown social networking platform.The government will share its response soon, the post on Koo said. Koo is being touted as the homegrown contender to Twitter.The blogpost by Twitter on Wednesday morning had the microblogging platform emphasising it will continue to advocate for the right of free expression of its users and that it is “actively exploring options under Indian law - both for Twitter and for the accounts that have been impacted”.The development comes in the backdrop of the government -- on February 4 -- ordering Twitter to take down 1,178 accounts with links to Pakistan and Khalistan supporters that were spreading misinformation and provocative content related to farmers’ protest.In all, Twitter has taken action against over 1,000 accounts -- 500 as sought by the government and an equal number that were found by the company engaging in platform manipulation and spam.The government had late last month sought blocking of 257 tweets and handles in connection with the agitation by farmers over the new pro-market agricultural laws. Twitter complied, only to restore the accounts hours later.Also read: What is Koo, the Indian microblogging website, and how does it workThis led to the government issuing a non-compliance notice and a warning of stringent penalties and potential jail terms.Seeking to clarify its stance, Twitter—in its blogpost on Wednesday—said it had taken steps to reduce the visibility of the hashtags containing harmful content that included prohibiting them from trending on Twitter and appearing as recommended search terms.It has “withheld a portion of the accounts identified in the blocking orders” within India, making them accessible only outside the country.Stating that it has informed the IT Ministry (MeitY) of its enforcement action, Twitter said it has taken a range of enforcement actions against over 500 accounts escalated across all MeitY orders - including permanent suspension in certain cases for violation of its rules.“...Today, we have withheld a portion of the accounts identified in the blocking orders under our Country Withheld Content policy within India only. These accounts continue to be available outside of India,” Twitter said.It, however, did not provide details of the handles against whom action had been taken.Twitter argued that it has not taken any action on accounts that consist of news media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians as it does “not believe that the actions we have been directed to take are consistent with Indian law, and, in keeping with our principles of defending protected speech and freedom of expression”.It contended that doing so would violate the fundamental right to free expression under Indian law.“We remain committed to safeguarding the health of the conversation occurring on Twitter, and strongly believe that the Tweets should flow,” it said.Emphasising that transparency is the foundation for promoting healthy public conversation on the platform and earning trust, Twitter said it is critical that people understand its approach to content moderation and how it engages with governments globally.“The values that underpin the Open Internet and free expression are increasingly under threat around the world... Twitter exists to empower voices to be heard, and we continue to make improvements to our service so that everyone - no matter their views or perspective - feels safe participating in the public conversation,” Twitter said.Twitter said, following the reports of violence in New Delhi in recent weeks, it wanted to share a granular update on its proactive efforts it took to enforce its rules.Starting January 26, Twitter said its global team took action “judiciously and impartially” on content, Trends, Tweets, and accounts that were in violation of its rules and took action on “hundreds of accounts” that violated its rules on “inciting violence, abuse, wishes of harm, and threats that could trigger the risk of offline harm”.Actions taken included preventing certain terms from appearing in the Trends section and suspension of more than 500 accounts that were engaging in clear examples of platform manipulation and spam.Apart from its enforcement under the Twitter Rules, the company said it had been served with several separate blocking orders by MeitY under Section 69A of the IT Act.“Out of these, two were emergency blocking orders that we temporarily complied with, but subsequently restored access to the content in a manner that we believe was consistent with Indian law,” it said.Twitter further pointed out that after this was communicated to MeitY, it was served with a non-compliance notice. — PTITransparency is the foundation for promoting healthy public conversation. Following the reports of violence in recent weeks, we're sharing a granular update on our proactive efforts to enforce our rules and defend our principles in India: https://t.co/ry557Nj94U||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-agitation-twitter-suspends-over-500-accounts-after-govt-order-210401
11-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||Will Azad switch to BJP, be V-P nominee, saffron face in Kashmir? Speculation rife after PM's praise||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 10Ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's emotional speech praising Congress MP Ghulam Nabi Azad in the Rajya Sabha, speculations are doing the rounds over the future of the senior leader from Jammu and Kashmir and also the two PDP leaders who retired with him.Some visualised Azad as a potential NDA candidate for the post of Vice-President or the Rajya Sabha Chairperson.Others, citing the Congress' "G-23", saw in Azad a possible saffron face in Jammu and Kashmir where the government plans to hold elections sometime in the future.While the BJP's prospects are well looked after in Jammu region, it lacks sufficient talent in the Valley, leaders who are "tall, credible, compassionate and can provide healing touch to the region", say sources.If read with the PM's reply to the debate on President's Address in the Rajya Sabha, some dots can be connected.A day before his speech, Modi drew attention to Azad’s easy manner and his comments on Jammu and Kashmir and the recent DDC polls.“Ghulam Nabi ji always speaks decently and never uses foul language. We should learn this from him, I respect him for it. He praised elections held in Jammu and Kashmir... I believe your party will take it in the right spirit, and not make the mistake of doing the opposite by listening to suggestions of 'G-23',” said the PM, referring to the term "Group of 23" used for Congress leaders who wrote to party chief Sonia Gandhi last year demanding changes in the organisation.The PM's comments were also seen as an open invitation by the BJP to the group of dissenting Congress leaders.Other BJP leaders too are all praise for the "soft-spoken, compassionate and gentle" Azad "who wants the situation to improve in the Valley".At 71 years, Azad has a few years before he crosses the BJP's unofficial age of retirement, which is 75 years.Moreover, for good talent, some concessions can be always made, say observers who also point to "good words" for the Narendra Modi government, including praise for Ujjwala Yojana, by PDP members who retired along with Azad.Nazir Ahmed Laway (PDP) said he would hope that a Bill would be brought in Parliament soon to make J&K a state once again.“The Prime Minister and Home Minister had promised this in the House that Jammu and Kashmir will become a state again. I am confident that God willing, a Bill to this effect will be brought in the House one of these days,” Laway said.The PDP MP said he had opposed the move vociferously in the House. Now, when he would return to Kashmir, he said he would tell the people how much the rest of India cared for Kashmir and empathised with its people. “Parliament is our country’s fragrance and I am taking the fragrance with me to J&K,” he said.Another outgoing PDP MP Mir Mohammed Fayaz appealed to Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah to make Jammu and Kashmir a state again and restore its special status.Fayaz said he was happy to see that people came out to vote in the District Development Council (DDC) poll held in J&K recently. The “Ujjwala” scheme, under, which LPG cylinder were being introduced to households not having the facility, was also turning out to be a big step to help the poor women of J&K, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-azad-switch-to-bjp-be-v-p-nominee-saffron-face-in-kashmir-speculation-rife-after-pms-praise-210398
