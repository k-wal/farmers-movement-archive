External forces can be spectators but not participants. Indians know India and should decide for India. Let’s remain united as a nation. #IndiaTogether #IndiaAgainstPropaganda,” Sachin tweeted.In a statement, the MEA said a very small section of farmers in parts of the country have some reservations about the farm reforms and a proper understanding of the issue is needed before rushing to comment on the agitation.India’s sovereignty cannot be compromised.

So we moved discharge application under the Code of Criminal Procedure,” advocate Champaneri said.The court will hear Gandhi’s application on February 11.The ADC Bank and Patel dragged Gandhi to the court over the Congress leader’s allegation that the bank was involved in a scam as it swapped scrapped notes of Rs 750 crore with valid currency within five days of demonetization in 2016.

He had written about it to the Maharashtra government. The state home department gave its sanction (to file a complaint),” a senior police official said.The complaint has been filed under Indian Penal Code sections 499, 500 (defamation) and 501 (printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory).Goswami made “grossly false”, “malicious” and defamatory statements during the coverage of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death by suicide last year, it claimed.These defamatory statements were telecast on the channel Republic Bharat during a discussion about phone records of actor Rhea Chakraborty, Rajput’s girlfriend, it said.“The said defamatory attacks have been made with a singular view of assassinating his (Trimukhe’s) official character and thereby...maliciously and deliberately causing undue humiliation of the Mumbai Police Department,” the complaint said.Goswami also tweeted the contents of the telecast to a larger audience, the complaint said.When contacted, Goswami’s lawyer said they had not received any intimation about the court complaint yet. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sushant-singh-rajput-case-mumbai-cop-files-defamation-complaint-against-arnab-goswami-207443
03-02-2021||Jaipur||Supply of special pink sandstone for Ayodhya’s Ram temple to be eased soon||A standing committee of the Rajasthan Wildlife Board has cleared a proposal to allow the mining of a special sandstone, much sought after by builders including those constructing the Ram temple in Ayodhya, from Bharatpur’s Bandh Baretha sanctuary.The proposal to denotify the sanctuary for the mining of the pink sandstone from there will now be put up before the Rajasthan Wildlife Board, headed by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Chief Wildlife Warden Mohan Meena told PTI on Wednesday.“The standing committee has given the approval and the matter will be now taken up by the state wildlife board for consideration after which it will be sent for the approval by the National Wildlife Board,” he said.Thousands of tonnes of the pink sandstone mined in Bharatpur’s Bansi Paharpur have been sourced for the temple over the years, but much more is needed, he added.There were concerns in Ayodhya that supplies of this stone with a unique pink hue would dry up.Since blocks of this sandstone had already been carved—ready to be put in place as the temple comes up—switching over to a lesser grade of stone would have caused problems.The Dholpur variant is said to be no match to the Bansi Paharpur stone.Authorities in Congress-run Rajasthan, however, denied that the move to denotify the Bansi Paharpur block in Bharatpur’s Bandh Baretha wildlife sanctuary has anything specific to do with the Ram temple.A senior district administration official said the stone is in high demand across the country and the process for the denotification was not started only because the particular sandstone is required for the Ram Temple.“There is rampant illegal mining in the area. There is no forest left there and if it is delinked from the sanctuary, the state government will get the revenue from any mining there,” he said.Mining was banned after 2016 but illegal operations continued and the Bansi Paharpur (pink stone) sandstone remained available in the grey market. Supply of the stone took a hit after the Bharatpur administration seized 25 trucks loaded with illegally mined pink sandstone last September. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supply-of-special-pink-sandstone-for-ayodhyas-ram-temple-to-be-eased-soon-207442

Cyber crime may target an individual, an organisation or a government. Financial fraud, invasion of privacy, illegal trade, online stalking, data theft, subversion and espionage are a few examples of cyber crime.Police and public order are state subjects as per the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution and the respective state governments are primarily responsible for the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution of  crimes, including cyber crimes.According to the MHA, the Central government has taken several steps to strengthen the mechanism to deal with cyber crimes in a comprehensive and coordinated manner by spreading awareness, issuing alerts and advisories, capacity  building and training of law enforcement personnel, prosecutors and judicial officers, and improving cyber forensic facilities.The National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal for filing complaints pertaining to all types of cyber crimes with special focus on cyber crimes against women and children has also been launched.The government is also operating the Cyber Swachhta Kendra (Botnet Cleaning and Malware Analysis Centre), which is providing detection of malicious programs as well as free tools for cleaning malicious codes, the MHA stated.The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) coordinates with its counterpart agencies in foreign countries on cyber incidents originating from outside the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cyber-crime-cases-more-than-double-in-three-years-mha-207439

03-02-2021||Gorakhpur||Year-long commemoration of Chauri Chaura incident to start Thursday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Thursday inaugurate a year-long commemoration of the Chauri Chaura incident, an outbreak of violence a century back which led Mahatma Gandhi to halt his non-cooperation movement against the British.Modi will release a postage stamp through video conference to mark the beginning of the centenary of that episode.At Thursday’s event, 99 people, descendants of those involved in the benchmark incident of India’s Independence Movement will be honoured.A total of 23 policemen were killed when a peaceful crowd of non-cooperation movement, infuriated by police firing killing three of them, turned violent and set ablaze the Chauri Chaura police post in which the outnumbered policemen had taken shelter after retracting.The killing of the Chauri Chaura policemen had resulted in arrests of hundreds of protesters with 228 of them being put on trial, six of them dying during it and 172 ordered to be hanged to death with the remaining sentenced to long-term imprisonments after a hasty eight-month trial.Reviewing the death sentences, the Allahabad High Court finally in April 1923 confirmed it for 19 convicts, sentenced 110 of them to life imprisonments in Kalapani (Port Blair) and long jail terms to others.Those chosen to be honoured on the occasion include 72-year-old Kamla Prasad of Dumri Khurd, a grandson of Chinugi who had got the ‘Kalapani’ punishment after the incident.“I am happy that we are getting the honour and the country will know us from tomorrow,” said an elated Kamla Prasad.On the occasion, the chief minister may also announce the change in name of Mundera Bazar Nagar Panchayat, the area where the police post then existed, to Chauri Chaura Nagar Panchayat, said an official.Gorakhpur District Magistrate Vijyendra Pandiyan said the district administration has already sent a proposal to the government for the name change of the area.“The year-long commemoration of the Chauri Chaura incident’s centenary will begin in all 75 districts of the state with ‘Prabhat Pheris’ and other programmes from February 4 and will continue till February 4, 2022,”   an official said.Besides the beautification of Chauri Chaura Shaheed Sthal in Gorakhpur, the area is also being developed as a tourist spot on the lines of India Gate, Jallianwala Bagh and Cellular Jail in Andaman, a senior official said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/year-long-commemoration-of-chauri-chaura-incident-to-start-thursday-207432
03-02-2021||---||BJP attacks ‘Rahul, Rihanna and racket’||New Delhi, February 3With many international personalities and celebrities lending support to India’s agitating farmers, the BJP on Wednesday lashed out at “propaganda and fake narratives”, accusing Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of “conspiring with anti-India elements during his trips abroad”.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra alleged that Rahul Gandhi “goes abroad to hatch conspiracy with anti-India elements as to how to defame India and drag the country into controversies”.“Be it Rihanna or Mia Khalifa or others like them who have tweeted, Rahul Gandhi meets these people for anti-India propaganda,” he claimedStating that the title of his press conference was “Rahul, Rihanna and racket”, Patra claimed Gandhi is “using farmers’ protests for his political interests and instigating people to do politics over dead bodies”.Patra said farmers have been saying they have nothing to do with politics but Gandhi has shown his “immaturity” by trying to talk on their behalf. He also defended the massive barricading done by the Delhi Police to block farmers on Delhi borders. The police have taken measures to ensure that the violence which happened on January 26 is not repeated, he said.“Even the Congress and Rahul Gandhi had asked why farmers were allowed to enter Red Fort and they are now upset at the Delhi Police for taking preventing measures,” Patra said, alleging that they wanted conflict and police firing so that “there are dead bodies to do politics over”.On Gandhi’s allegation that there is no leadership in India, Patra said he may have been speaking with the Congress on mind. On his veiled dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi as to why names of so many dictators begin with the letter “M”, Patra said names of former prime minister Manmohan Singh and Mahatma Gandhi also begin with the same letter.He also objected to the Punjab government and the Congress deciding to provide legal aid to those against whom the police had taken legal action during Delhi violence on January 26.“Earlier they were alleging that BJP agents were responsible for the violence, now they are providing them legal aid. There is no institution in the country that would stand with anarchists and the rioters of January 26. Are these people associated with Rahul Gandhi and that is why he is ready to provide legal aid to them,” Patra questioned.Attacking Gandhi over his allegation that the government wants to “kill” farmers, Patra said the Delhi Police acted with admirable restraint, pointing to the 1998-incident in Madhya Pradesh when over 28 farmers were killed in a police firing when the Congress was in power. “You (Gandhi) have done politics over the dead bodies of farmers. You are spreading lies,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-attacks-rahul-rihanna-and-racket-207430

03-02-2021||New Delhi||SC refuses to entertain plea challenging laws dealing with religious conversion||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to entertain a plea challenging the validity of laws enacted by states, including Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, which deal with religious conversion by marriage and others.A Bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde, while saying that the petitioner should approach the concerned high court, observed that the issue raised is important and the high courts of Allahabad and Uttarakhand are already dealing with petitions on it. “We are not on merits at all. Allahabad and Uttarakhand high courts are entertaining similar petitions. We are not denying the importance of matter at all. We are saying we would like to have the benefit of high courts view,” said the Bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Senior advocate Sanjay Parikh, appearing for the petitioner, said they have challenged the laws enacted by three states including Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand as innocent persons are being booked under these Acts.He said the top court had earlier issued notice on similar petitions and this plea should be tagged with them.However, the Bench said the petitioner should approach the concerned high court on this.“Sanjay Parikh, senior counsel for the petitioners seeks permission to withdraw the writ petition with liberty to approach the high court. The writ petition is dismissed as withdrawn with liberty as prayed for,” the Bench said in its order.On January 25, the top court had refused to transfer to itself the petitions filed in the Allahabad High Court challenging the new state law.The Bench had said that it would like to have the advantage of the high court order. Taking note of the observation by the apex court, the Uttar Pradesh government had preferred to withdraw the transfer petition.Before that, on January 6, the apex court had agreed to examine the new laws of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand regulating religious conversions by marriage.However, it had refused to stay the controversial provisions of the laws and had issued notices to both the state governments on two separate petitions.Both the petitions have challenged the Constitutional validity of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020 and the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018.The Uttar Pradesh Ordinance was cleared by the state Cabinet in November last year and ascent was given by Governor Anandiben Patel on November 28, 2020. It relates not only to inter-faith marriages but all religious conversions and lays down elaborate procedures for those who wish to convert to another religion.The Uttarakhand Act entails two year jail term for those found guilty of religious conversion through force or “allurement”, which can be in cash or in kind—employment or material benefit. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-plea-challenging-laws-dealing-with-religious-conversion-207424

The announcement was made soon after the schools and other educational institutions were reopened after nearly a year. The change mainly concerns the SSC Public Examinations. According to the memo issued by the government, “As part of the new six question paper pattern, paper-I and paper-II of First Language, English, Mathematics, General Science (Physical Science and Biology) and Social Studies will be merged into a single paper instead of two papers for each subject. There will be no change in the second language paper”. According to the new format, students will have to write six question papers instead of the existing 11 after the government reduced the number of question papers for the academic year 2020-21. This means, there will be only one paper for each subject. The memo says the examinations will be held for 600 marks including 480 marks for board exams and 120 for internals i.e., an average of two formative assessments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-reduces-exam-burden-on-students-207420
03-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||Kerala polls: Acid test for JP Nadda||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 3BJP president JP Nadda is in Kerala to launch NDA’s  campaign for upcoming Assembly elections in the state, expected to be his most difficult assignments among the poll-bound states this season.Sources though say Nadda has managed a “patch up” between warring factions of Kerala BJP and also affected a “strategic tweak” in party’s plan to do better than the last elections when it won just one Assembly seat.Apparently, Nadda “with the help of Mizoram Governor PS Sreedharan Pillai” has managed to iron out differences between rival factions led by Union Minister V Muraleedharan and former state BJP president PK Krishnadas with a “compromise formula”.According to the “formula”, Rajya Sabha MP and Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs V Murlaleedharan may contest from the Kazhakkuttom constituency, which he lost last time by around 5,000 votes.Sreedharan Pillai will help Muralidharan get the crucial Nair votes.Muralidharan, who is Ezhava by caste, is expected to face CPM’s Ezhava leader Kadakampally Surenderan, who won from the constituency last time.Meanwhile, once Muralidharan gets elected to the Assembly, his Rajya Sabha seat and Central portfolio may go to Sreedharan Pillai. If that happens, it  will not be first time a Governor, and that too from Mizioam, will return to active politics.Former Kerala BJP president Kummanam Rajasekharan, who was also the Governor of Mizoram for some time, is expected to be fielded from party’s stronghold of Nemom.In the last election, BJP won just one seat and that was from Nemom, where senior leader O Rajagopal opened the account for the party in the Kerala Assembly. Rajagopal, who is above 90 years, may not be contesting this time, say the sources.Former editor of ‘Organiser’, R Balasanker, is expected to contest from the Chengannur constituency where Sabarimala sentiment prevails in favour of the BJP.Attempts are also being made to patch up with rebel leader Sobha Surendran by offering her the Palakkad seat. BJP has also roped in former DGPs Senkumar and Jacob Thomas.The sources are also talking of a “paradigm shift in BJP’s Kerala strategy” this time. While in previous elections the saffron  party tackled the CPM as main rival and also "supported" Congress candidates where it had no chance of winning, this time it is expected to be the other way round.

This action of the government to propose amendments which were rejected by the house at their instance amounts to contempt of the house,” Premachandran said in the notice addressed to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.He submitted the notice to the Lok Sabha secretariat this morning, a source told PTI.The MP said the demand of the opposition to scrutinise the provisions of the bill by the standing committee or select committee was not considered by the government.Subsequent to the enactment of law, the mover of the bill, the Agriculture Minister, openly said the government is ready and willing to discuss each and every provision of the bill clause by clause with the farmers and ready for required amendments, the Opposition MP asserted.Premachandran, whose party RSP is part of the Congress-led UPA, said when the matter was considered by the Supreme Court, the government had agreed for appointment of a Committee to scrutinise the provisions of law enacted by the Parliament which further complicated the issue.“The scrutiny of the Bill on merit is the privilege of the Parliament under the scheme of the constitution and such right cannot be passed over to agency even through the intervention of the judiciary,” he said.Premachandran, a five-time MP, said that the court can intervene only on two grounds—constitutional validity of the bill passed by Parliament and legislative competence of Parliament.Therefore, he said, the scrutiny of the bill on merit by another agency than Parliament is also contempt of the House. Tens of thousands of farmers have been camping on the outskirts of Delhi for 70 days in protest against the three laws enacted in September last year.In talks with the protesting farmer leaders, the Centre, represented by Agriculture Minister Tomar, and his cabinet colleagues Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash, had proposed to suspend for one-and-a-half years the three contentious farm laws that have triggered the protracted protests.The ministers had also repeatedly told the farmer unions that they would be open for amendments. The farmers’ unions had rejected all proposals of the Centre and were adamant on their demand for the repeal of the three farm laws.The farmers believe that the new laws undermine their livelihood and open the path for the corporate sector to dominate agriculture.The government, on the other hand, maintains that the new laws will give farmers more options on selling their produce, lead to better pricing, and free them from unfair monopolies.

You have not been sent for slogan shouting and clapping...people in your constituencies are watching you,” Birla told the Opposition MPsCongress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said they want the discussion on Presidential address. But they also wanted to raise farmers’ issues before the discussion on the Budget.“We will continue to raise voice for farmers,” he said.Announcing the adjournment of the House barely a couple of minutes after it had reassembled at 9 pm, Birla said “you do not want to speak, otherwise you will go back to your seats”.Earlier in the day, Divisions in Congress strategy in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha came to the fore with the lower house remaining disrupted over demand for discussion on farmers’ issues but the upper house proceeding with a debate on the Motion of Thanks on President’s address.“Just as we reached a consensus to award 15 hours for the President’s address debate in Rajya Sabha, we arrived at a similar consensus for Lok Sabha also. Both I and the Speaker spoke to opposition leaders before the LS started today and there was an agreement to first discuss the President’s address which is a priority. The opposition agreed in the meetings to start the debate and they have now flipped. We do not know why,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said.The Congress led opposition sought repeal of farm laws and raised “take back black laws” slogans.LS Speaker Om Birla’s appeals to let the question hour run did not cut ice.Earlier, Congress MP Manish Tewari and several other opposition MPs moved adjournment notices to discuss farmers issues.The notices were disallowed.In RS, Ghulam nabai Azad and Anand Sharma, both part of the dissenting group of Congressmen who earlier sought radical reforms in the party organization, are the party’s floor leaders in RS.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-adjourned-for-the-day-rs-discusses-motion-of-thanks-207405

03-02-2021||Aditi Tandon||Do your job: Rahul to PM on farmers’ protest||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 3A combative Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to do his job, and said the Prime Minister’s job was to heed farmers’ concerns and not to “sell the country to one per cent people.”The Congress leader attacked the Prime Minister for not engaging the farmers and said, “Do your job. Your job is to protect the farmers. Go give them a hug. Ask them what you can do for them. But the PM has given up. He is on a different plane these days. He has a beard. We are going somewhere else now,” Gandhi said, adding that India’s global reputation had taken a hit because of the way “the government was treating farmers and its own people by fortifying Delhi.”He also said the country was “lacking in leadership and everything was coming apart.”The myth will break one day, he noted, adding that the reputation of India had taken a massive hit.“Indian reputation has taken a hit not only for how we are treating our farmers, but also how we treat journalists. Our biggest strength, our soft power, has been shattered by the BJP and RSS, and their mindset,” said Gandhi.On foreigners commenting about farm stir, he said the issue was internal to India.Questioning the Prime Minister for telling the all-party meet that the offer of suspension of farm laws was on the table, Gandhi asked “what does that mean? The farmers do not want to talk to the Prime Minister. They want the farm laws repealed. You either believe you need to get rid of the laws or you don’t.”On a question about the farmers being allegedly called anti-nationals by a section, Gandhi asked, “Are 60 pc agriculturists who grow food grain for us terrorists? Agriculture was the bright spot through COVID and now the spine of India is being broken.”Earlier, Gandhi asked the government whether it was afraid of the farmers to be fortifying the National Capital.Are farmers our enemies? They are our strength and crushing them is not the job of the government. The government‘s job is to talk to farmers and resolve the matter because this disharmony is not good for India. It is dangerous for India. The farmers won’t retreat. The government will have to retreat and the sooner the better,” he said.Gandhi again asked the Home Minister to explain how some people stormed the Red Fort on Republic Day.Rahul slams Union BudgetSlamming the Union Budget, Gandhi said, “The government has messed up the economy, harmony and defence and now wants to keep distracting India with non events. I see India is a dangerous situation. The world is in a flux. We have an aggressive China on the border.”Gandhi accused the government of helping one per cent corporate through the Budget and giving no money to people, MSMEs or for the defence of the country at the time of alleged Chinese incursions at the LAC.“What message are you giving to China, that you will not raise defence expenditure? What would the pilots and soldiers be thinking that they are facing a crisis and the government won’t give them money? Today the Armed Forces’ commitment is 100 per cent. The government’s commitment should be 110 pc. What kind of patriotism is this? “||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/do-your-job-rahul-to-pm-on-farmers-protest-207391
03-02-2021||Mumbai||Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, others say ‘India against propaganda’ after Rihanna, Greta support farmers protest||Bollywood stars Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, filmmaker Karan Johar and Suniel Shetty on Wednesday said citizens should focus on the government’s efforts to resolve the ongoing farmer crisis rather than paying attention to “half truths” and those “creating differences.”  Their comments came after the Ministry of External Affairs reacted sharply to comments by international pop star Rihanna, teen climate activist Greta Thunberg and others on farmers’ protests.In a statement, the MEA said a very small section of farmers in parts of the country have some reservations about the farm reforms and a proper understanding of the issue is needed before rushing to comment on the agitation.Rihanna, who has 100 million followers on Twitter and is among the most followed people on the microblogging site, on Tuesday tweeted, “why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest, linking a CNN report on the internet shutdown near the protest site.Sharing the MEA statement on Twitter, Akshay said that the efforts by the government to solve the issue are “evident”.“Farmers constitute an extremely important part of our country. And the efforts being undertaken to resolve their issues are evident. Let’s support an amicable resolution, rather than paying attention to anyone creating differences. #IndiaTogether #IndiaAgainstPropaganda,” Kumar wrote.Devgn urged the people to be wary of “false propaganda against India or Indian policies”.“Don’t fall for any false propaganda against India or Indian policies. Its important to stand united at this hour w/o any infighting #IndiaTogether #IndiaAgainstPropaganda” he posted.Johar said the country shouldn’t let “anyone divide us”.“We live in turbulent times and the need of the hour is prudence and patience at every turn. Let us together, make every effort we can to find solutions that work for everyone—our farmers are the backbone of India. Let us not let anyone divide us. #IndiaTogether” he said.Shetty also shared the MEA on Twitter, saying nothing is “more dangerous than half truth”. “We must always take a comprehensive view of things, as there is nothing more dangerous than half truth. #IndiaTogether #IndiaAgainstPropaganda” he said.Without naming anyone, singer Kailesh Kher said that anti-India can stoop to any level to defame the country. “Even in this sad phase of pandemic, India is helping all nations with vaccine supply for the sake of Humanity. Let all realise that India is ONE & will not tolerate comments against it. #IndiaTogether #IndiaAgainstPropaganda” he tweeted.On Tuesday night, international pop star Rihanna became the first global name to voice her support to the ongoing farmers agitation while criticising the internet shutdown at the protest site.Later, Thunberg, Swedish environmental activist, also backed the agitation, tweeting, “We stand in solidarity with the #FarmersProtest in India.”       In its response, the MEA said the Parliament of India passed the reformist legislation relating to the agricultural sector, and noted that some of the vested interest groups have tried to mobilise international support against India.“We would like to emphasise that these protests must be seen in the context of India’s democratic ethos and polity, and the efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse.The minister asserted that facts should be ascertained and a proper understanding of the issues must be taken “before rushing to comment on such matters”.“The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,” the statement said.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at several Delhi border points since November last year, demanding the government to repeal the three farm laws and legal guarantee of minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.Sites of the farmer protest at Delhi’s borders have turned into fortresses with the police beefing up security and putting up multi-layer barricades to stop the movement of vehicles. Barbed wire has also been put up to keep off people on foot.The strengthened security measures at the agitation sites across the Delhi borders come after the violence during the Republic day tractor parade. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/akshay-kumar-ajay-devgn-others-say-india-against-propaganda-after-rihanna-greta-support-farmers-protest-207390

A nationwide debate should be launched starting at the village level, involving stakeholders from all sections of society before framing laws and policies which will help farming communities and other marginalised communities in the long term. To pave the way for solving farmers issues, the current laws should be abandoned without any further delay," it added.The 413 signatories to the statement include academicians from universities and institutions including Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jadavpur University, IIT Kanpur, IIT Madras, IISc Bangalore, Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata, Delhi University, Panjab University, Tezpur University, Central university of Punjab, IIT Bombay and IIM Calcutta.A few signatories are from foreign universities including University of Zagreb, Croatia, London Film School, University of Johannesburg, University of Oslo, University of Massachusetts and University of Pittsburgh.The academicians recommended that farming could be made into a sustainable and profitable activity by announcing minimum support price (MSP) for a large number of crops, specifying state-wise quotas for government procurement, and making the MSP rate legally binding for all other buyers as well.The statement also called for price control on farm inputs such as manure, seeds and power, farm loan waivers, and a revival of the village-based development model so that migration to cities could be curtailed.

03-02-2021||Satya Prakash||SC refuses to entertain PILs for probe by judicial panel into R-Day violence||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 3The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to entertain PILs for a probe by a judicial inquiry commission into the Republic Day violence during farmers' tractor rally in the national capital.“We are sure the government is inquiring into it and taking appropriate action," a Bench headed by by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told the petitioners."The PM in his statement has said the law will take its own course. So the government is investigating it," the CJI pointed out.The Supreme Court was hearing a plea seeking directions to set up an Inquiry Commission under the chairmanship of a retired Supreme Court judge to look into the entire aspect of clash between farmers and Delhi Police on January 26 during the farmers’ tractor rally.Petitioners' counsel said the investigation shouldn't be one-sided. Statement of the other side should also be recorded.“Obviously...What does an investigation mean? Both sides will be investigated...,” said the CJI.Giving liberty to the petitioners to withdraw their petitions, it asked them to make a representation to the ministry concerned.With regard to a petition filed by advocate ML Sharma that raised the issue of alleged improper voting on farm bills, the top court said the validity of the farm laws was already pending adjudication in other petitions.Thousands of protesters had forced their entry into Red Fort and certain other areas, fought with the police, damaged a large number of vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort. One protester had died after his speeding tractor overturned.Advocate Vishal Tiwari’s petition demanded a three-member inquiry commission under the chairmanship of a former SC judge and FIRs against those responsible for the violence and causing dishonour of the National Flag on Republic Day.Advocate Sharma wanted the court to direct the authorities concerned and the media not to declare farmers as “terrorists” without any evidence. There was a “planned conspiracy” to sabotage the farmers’ protest by declaring them as terrorists, he alleged, and urged the court to prohibit propagation of “false allegations” against farmers.Tiwari alleged that there might be some conspiracy by some “notorious forces or organisations” to cause disturbance and damage the peaceful protest and create clashes between police and protesting farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-pils-for-probe-by-judicial-panel-into-r-day-violence-207364

There was a demand for UT in only one district of Ladakh (Leh), not Kargil,” Azad said, adding: “Even though I would have been happy if Ladakh would have been made a UT and J&K would have left as it was”.The Congress leader, however, congratulated the government on conducting successul elections to the District Development Council (DDC) elections in J&K.Azad claimed that on other parameters the both the UTs have fallen below their earlier positions.“The law and order were 100 times better when J&K was a State. Developmental works were 100 times better when there was a State government, even when it was BJP-PDP government,” he said, adding that tourism and education industries have been “finished” in the two UTs.“Tourists don’t visit the place much now, and the ones that do frequent only the luxury hotels, and rarely interact with locals. How can local people benefit from this,” Azad said.“As for education, the internet connection is often cut off, and even when available, it is 2G. In the age of 4G connectivity, how can we do anything with 2G? This is affecting the education of students, especially during this pandemic,” Azad said.“Indira Gandhi taught us that we can’t fight on so many fronts. People in Ladakh, Jammu are not happy that anyone can buy their land or get jobs. No one is happy in J&K and Ladakh,” he told Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was present in the House.“We have to take our people in confidence and give them love,” he said asking the Prime Minister to restore statehood to J&K.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/restore-statehood-to-j-k-dont-fight-own-people-ghulam-nabi-azad-tells-pm-207363
03-02-2021||New Delhi||SC junks PIL seeking direction to CBI to submit status report in Sushant Singh death case||The Supreme Court Wednesday junked a PIL seeking direction to the CBI to submit a status report in Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case.A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian dismissed the plea filed by advocate Puneet Kaur Dhanda.“We are not going to entertain this. You go to the High Court,” the bench said.The petitioner had contended that the apex court passed an order for the CBI inquiry on August 19, 2020 and despite lapse of almost five months the probe agency is yet to conclude its investigation.“The CBI is not acting responsibly in the present case and there is a delay in the conclusion of the investigation of the case,” it said.“Even in serious offences like murder, the law stipulates filing of charge sheet in 90 days but in the present case the premium investigating agency has failed miserably in their role and the unnecessary delay in the present case is bringing bad name to the administration of justice not only in our country but across the globe,” the plea said.It sought a direction to the CBI to complete its probe within two months and submit a final report in the concerned court.It said Rajput was found dead in mysterious circumstances and the probe was initially conducted by Mumbai Police.“On dissatisfaction being shown by the family of the late actor this Court directed the Central Bureau of Investigation to conduct an inquiry in the mysterious death of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput,” the plea said.The PIL said that a fair, competent, impartial and speedy investigation is in the need of the hour.Rajput, 34, who made his silver screen debut in the critically acclaimed “Kai Po Che” seven years ago, was found dead in his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14, 2020.The CBI had taken over the probe from Bihar Police into the alleged abetment to suicide case filed by the actor’s father K K Singh in Patna against Rajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and her family. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-junks-pil-seeking-direction-to-cbi-to-submit-status-report-in-sushant-singh-death-case-207359
03-02-2021||New Delhi||No foreign govt backing to farm agitation: Govt in Lok Sabha||The government on Wednesday said in the Lok Sabha that no foreign government has backed the agitation against the farm laws even as the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in a statement criticised some of west’s top entertainment stars who, it says, were swayed by vested interest groups who were also behind the Red Fort violence.“No foreign government has supported the agitation against the farm Bills which were passed by Parliament. In Canada, UK, the US and in a few European countries, protests by a few motivated persons of Indian origin has been reported,” Minister of State for Foreign Affairs V Muraleedharan told former journalist Imtiyaz Jaleel Syed (AIMIM) during Question Hour in Lok Sabha.It admitted that Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has spoken on the farmers’ agitation.The MEA on the other hand took on private individuals and asked them to ascertain facts and get a proper understanding of the issues before rushing to comment on such matters.“The temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments, especially when resorted to by celebrities and others, is neither accurate nor responsible,” said the MEA in a statement. It was unfortunate to see vested interest groups trying to enforce their agenda on these protests, and derail them as was the case on January 26, the anniversary of the inauguration of the Constitution of India, which was “besmirched, and violence and vandalism” took place in the national capital.The MEA said some of these vested interest groups have also tried to mobilise international support against India and instigated the desecration of Mahatma Gandhi’s statues in parts of the world. Also read: After Rihanna creates flutter over farmers tweet, Kangana calls her ‘fool’, farmers ‘terrorists’“This is extremely disturbing for India and for civilised society everywhere,” it said.

The laws will also pave the way for economically and ecologically sustainable farming, said the MEA, to counter teen environmental activist Greta Thunberg’s opinion. Also read: Rakesh Tikait emerges ‘hero’ of farmers’ agitation initiated by Punjab unionsIt was a “very small section of farmers who have some reservations” about these reforms.

It is the responsibility of all the Governments to find the missing farmers and inform their families.

Instead of this, it would be better if such action is on the borders of the country to stop terrorists,” she said in another tweet.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at the national capital’s borders for over two months against the laws.They are demanding that the government repeal the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-should-repeal-farm-laws-work-towards-normalising-situation-at-delhi-borders-mayawati-207339

The other UTs are Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dadra Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Lakshadweep and Puducherry.Vardhan allayed privacy concerns when asked if the government planned to store personal data of citizens with the help of an Indian company or some external company and if it would mean a violation of the privacy of Indian citizens if the data was stored with an external company.“The selection of vendors for the National Digital Health Mission is compliant with rules and policies of the government. The data is stored in a federated architecture as described in the Mission Blueprint released in 2019,” the government said. There was no centralised database of medical records and NDHM enabled appropriate use of health data of individuals with their “consent only”, it said.There is no violation of privacy of Indian citizens, the minister said amid concerns since India did not have a law on privacy. The Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 is currently with a joint committee of Parliament for review.On data storage, the government said privacy was inbuilt in the design of the NDHM and all applicable laws and Supreme Court judgments were being followed.“All the building blocks that require handling personal health records are being designed to comply with such policy ab-initio. Further, medical records are made available to anyone only with the consent of the individual or his or her nominee,” the government said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/6-3-lakh-digital-health-ids-generated-207154

We note the ongoing talks between the governments of India and China and continue to support a direct dialogue and a peaceful resolution to border disputes,” Emily J Horne, spokesperson, National Security Council (NSC) of the White House, told PTI on Monday.She was responding to a question on recent Chinese attempts to intrude into Indian territories and occupy it.“The United States is concerned by Beijing’s pattern of ongoing attempts to intimidate its neighbours,” Horne said.“We will stand with friends, partners and allies to advance our shared prosperity, security and values in the Indo-Pacific region,” she added.This is the first response of the Biden administration on the India-China border clashes. Former vice president Joe Biden, a Democrat, was inaugurated as the 46th US President on January 20.China and India are locked in a military standoff in eastern Ladakh since May 5 last. The two countries have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks to resolve the face-off, but no significant headway has been made so far.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China’s growing assertiveness.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years.Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims. In the East China Sea, China has territorial disputes with Japan.The South China Sea and the East China Sea are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources.They are also vital to global trade. Although the US lays no claims to the disputed waters, it has challenged China’s growing territorial claims in the South China Sea by deploying warships and fighter jets to assert freedom of navigation and overflight patrols in the strategically-vital region.Addressing a joint session of Parliament, President Ram Nath Kovind last week said India had strengthened its military presence at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) along the two countries’ shared border to protect its sovereignty.“My government is fully committed to the protection of the interests of the nation and is also vigilant.

This incident also affected the daily life of the public. The internet services were interrupted as government ordered the operators to suspend the same. In the present time, the internet services are very essential to carry out the work in different professions especially in advocacy as the courts and our Supreme Court of India is functioning online,” Tiwari has said in his plea.It said clash between the farmers and police on the Republic Day has caught the attention of the entire world.“The matter is serious because when the protest was going on peacefully for last two months then suddenly, how it turned into violent movement and led violence on January 26. The question for consideration in national security and public interest arises that who is responsible for creating the disturbance and how and who turned the peaceful farmer protest into violent movement or how and who created the circumstances which let the protest turn violent,” it said.The plea said there may be some conspiracy by some “notorious forces or organisations” to cause disturbance and damage the peaceful protest and create clash between police and protesting farmers.On January 20, the Centre had withdrawn its application, filed through Delhi Police, seeking an injunction against the proposed tractor march on January 26 after the apex court had said that issue of tractor rally by farmers protesting against the new farms laws was in “executive domain”.On January 12, the apex court had stayed the implementation of the contentious new farm laws till further orders and constituted a four-member committee to make recommendations to resolve the impasse over them between the Centre and farmers’ unions protesting at Delhi borders.The members of the court-appointed committee were—Bhupinder Singh Mann, National President of Bhartiya Kisan Union, All India Kisan Coordination Committee; Parmod Kumar Joshi, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, and Anil Ghanwat, President of Shetkari Sanghatana.Later, Mann had recused himself from the committee. The top court had on January 12 said it would hear the pleas against the farm laws after eight weeks when the committee would give its suggestions to resolve the impasse after talking to the protesters and the government.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a month now against the three laws—the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.

03-02-2021||New Delhi||Fresh attempt to evict Sikhs from Shillong neighbourhood||There is no end to Meghalaya government’s effort to evict the Sikh residents of Harijan colony located at the heart of a prime commercial district in state capital Shillong.Gurjeet Singh, a resident of the colony, who is also president of Harijan Colony panchayat, told The Tribune over the phone from Shillong on Tuesday that a move was afoot to transfer the Harijan Colony land to the state government so that it could take steps against the Sikh inhabitants of the area.The Harijan Colony is located on an area which belongs to the traditional chieftain of the local Khasi tribe. According to land laws of Meghalaya, the state government or the Shillong Municipal Board has no right over the Harijan Colony land.More than a century ago, the land was presented to the ancestors of the present Sikh residents of the colony who had accompanied the colonial British troops as sweepers.Previous attempts made by the state government and the Shillong Municipal Board to evict the Sikh residents, mostly of Gurdaspur origin, did not work because the control of the land in question lied with the traditional Khasi chieftain known as Syiem.Official sources said that the present Syiem of the area was all set to sign an MoU with the state government transferring the ownership of the Harijan Colony land to the latter.Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) Chief Executive Member Titosstarwell Chyne has been sent a draft of the MoU. The KHADC made some modifications to the draft which was being sent to the state government for approval, the sources said.Gurjeet Singh, worried by the latest development, said that back in 1954 attempts were made to evict the Sikh residents of Harijan Colony by roping in the local tribal chieftain. However, the court ruled in favour of the residents taking into account the fact that the Sikh sweepers have been living in the area for several generations.A high-level committee constituted by the present state government under Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong more than two years ago to recommend steps for relocating the Sikh residents of Harijan Colony has not been able to submit its report yet as it is unsure whether its recommendation can withstand the scrutiny of the court.An altercation in June 2018 in the colony snowballed into a violent communal clash which paralysed life in the area for days. Residents of the colony continue to live under round-the-clock police vigil.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fresh-attempt-to-evict-sikhs-from-shillong-neighbourhood-206913
