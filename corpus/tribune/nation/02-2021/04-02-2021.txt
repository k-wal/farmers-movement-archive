Your Lordships should take note of this. I will have a petition filed tomorrow or Your Lordships may take suo motu notice. The order will set a dangerous precedent,” Venugopal had said.Following public outcry over the judgment, the Supreme Court Collegium had reportedly withdrawn its recommendation for confirming Justice Pushpa Ganediwala as a permanent judge.The NCW said the Bombay High Court’s decision “severely jeopardizes the interests of women and sets a dangerous precedent, which would have a cascading effect on the safety, security, integrity and dignity of women and children”.It contended that the HC verdict overlooked the very purpose and object of the Act — the protection of weaker sections of the society.Such an interpretation will adversely impact the rights of women, who were victims of sexual offences as it additionally required proof of disrobing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncw-moves-sc-against-bombay-hcs-skin-to-skin-contact-verdict-207978

The measures have started showing results,” Gowda said.He said that when the farmers of Punjab and Haryana were agitating Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar held talks with them and gave assurance to amend the laws to take care of their concerns. But the farmers have laid condition for repeal of the laws which has led to the impasse.“After the Republic Day incident the government has created barriers at the sites of farmers’ protests. This will not lead to solution of the problem.”“There has to be a congenial atmosphere,” Gowda said, and added that being a farmer himself, and during the last leg of his life he wanted to see a peaceful and amicable solution to the issue.He said the farm laws were passed without following proper proceedings as the House “was not in order”.The farmers are not convinced with government’s rationale that the laws will remove middlemen from the system, and are apprehensive on MSP.He stressed that 90 per cent of the farmers are in category of “small” and “marginal” whose land-holding ranging from a half to one acre.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/take-conciliatory-measures-to-end-impasse-on-farm-laws-deve-gowda-207975
04-02-2021||New Delhi||No evidence of COVID vaccine causing 19 deaths: Govt||The government on Thursday termed as “absolutely baseless narrative” the allegations that it rushed to certify that the COVID-19 vaccination was not the cause of death of 19 health workers, saying no evidence suggests such a link so far and all details of these fatalities will be made public after deliberations by experts.The deaths have been reported since the nationwide inoculation drive was launched on January 16 with over three crore healthcare and frontline workers prioritised to get the jabs initially.Responding to a query during a press conference, secretary in the health ministry Rajesh Bhushan said there is a very structured and robust system for adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) monitoring in India and information regarding the cause of death of 19 persons will be out in the public domain soon.Vouching for the safety of vaccines being administered in India, Niti Aayog Member V K Paul said that no death has been attributed to vaccines yet.“It is settled that these vaccines are safe. After giving 45 lakh doses, there are minimal side effects some times, like one person out of 1,150 persons got a side effect and no death has been attributed yet, proves that these vaccines are superbly safe and safest that can ever be devised,” Paul said.Elaborating on post-vaccination deaths, Bhushan said state AEFI committees have deliberated on all 19 deaths and there is no evidence of them being caused due to vaccination but once the National AEFI Committee meets and deliberates, there will be clarity.“There are 19 deaths of vaccinated people. Postmortem of all these deaths have been carried out by a board of three doctors. The state AEFI committees have deliberated on all these matters. There is no evidence of deaths caused due to the vaccination and once the National AEFI Committee meets and deliberates on this, the data will be shared on public domain,” he said.“There is a process which needs to be completed. So those who say that government has rushed to certify that there is no causality is absolutely baseless narrative,” Bhushan said.He said there is a very structured and robust system of AEFI monitoring in this country and added that it is being further strengthened.“We have a total of 8,563 AEFIs which have been captured in our digital system. We have done vaccination in lakhs. So what percentage is this? 0.18 per cent only. There have been so far 34 cases hospitalisation which is 0.0007 per cent of people immunised,” Bhushan said.

He is contesting extradition to India.The two, their family members and employees, bank officials and others were booked by the ED and the CBI in 2018 for perpetrating the alleged fraud in the Brady House branch of the PNB in Mumbai.            It was alleged that Choksi, his firm Gitanjali Gems and others “committed the offence of cheating against the Punjab National Bank in connivance with certain bank officials by fraudulently getting the LOUs (letters of undertaking) issued and got the FLCs (foreign letter of credit) enhanced without following prescribed procedure and caused a wrongful loss to the bank”.The ED said its probe found that “PNB bank officials in connivance with Choksi, Gitanjali Gems and others originally issued FLCs for smaller amount within the sanctioned limit and once FLC number was generated, the same number was used for amendment by way of enhancement of FLC and increase in the amount and such enhancement of amount was done at 4-5 times higher value of the original FLC amount”.“Such amendments were done outside the CBS system and hence it was not captured in the books of bank,” the ED alleged.It was found, the ED claimed, that the “branch (Brady House branch) was holding documents of original FLC amount and no import documents of such increased amount were found in the branch and much of fraudulent FLCs payments have gone to liquidate the overseas exporters’ liability arising out of earlier FLCs/discounting of bills”.         The agency has earlier attached a total of Rs 2,550 crore worth assets of Modi and Choksi in this case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-attaches-over-rs-14-crore-assets-of-choksi-gitanjali-gems-in-pnb-fraud-case-207971

We will take a decision after discussion,” Pawar told reporters after he was asked about Patole’s comments.Pawar said ballot papers were done away with because the electronic voting machine (EVM) helps save other expenses as the process becomes paperless.He noted that the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls are held using EVMs.“If there are doubts about holding other polls using EVMs, if there is any new technology and transparency can be ensured through it, then it must be thought about,” Pawar added.Replying to a question, he dismissed the allegation against the state government that it was being soft in taking action in connection with alleged objectionable speech made at the January 30 Elgar Parishad held in Pune.“The government is taking a very tough stand on it. We have all seen what stance the government took during the pandemic. An offence has already been registered against the people concerned,” he said.A case for allegedly promoting enmity between different groups was registered against Aligarh Muslim University alumnus Sharjeel Usmani in Pune on Tuesday in connection with his speech at the January 30 Elgar Parishad (conclave).The opposition BJP in Maharashtra had demanded action against Usmani, accusing him of hurting religious sentiments. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-cabinet-to-decide-on-ballot-paper-suggestion-ajit-pawar-207965

Lekhi tweeted, “I propose Greta Thunberg for Child bravery Award which Govt of India should bestow on her as she has done a huge service by uploading the document providing proof about hatching of a conspiracy to destabilise India from 1/1/ & leading up to 26/1/2021.”       As Thunberg reiterated her support on Thursday to the protests, Lekhi reacted, “She is just a child! What I despise are the people who have proposed her name for Nobel. A child who doesn’t understand sustainable farming practices, stubble burning or diversification of crops, water resource management can’t even be nominated, bad for civil society & credibility.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lekhi-mocks-thunberg-says-india-should-give-her-child-bravery-award-207959
04-02-2021||New Delhi||Migration of MBBS student from unrecognised college to recognised one impermissible: SC||Migration of a student pursuing an undergraduate medical course is permissible only if both the medical colleges are recognised by the Central Government under the law, the Supreme Court has ruled.    A Bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and Indira Banerjee set aside the verdict of the Rajasthan High Court which had directed the Medical Council of India (MCI) to permit migration of a student of MBBS course from an unrecognised medical college to a recognised one.“The interpretation of the Regulation 6(2) (of the Migration Rules) by the High Court is patently erroneous. The Regulation clearly lays down a restriction of migration from an unrecognised college to a recognised college. Regulation 6(2) provides that migration is permissible only if both the colleges are recognised u/s 11(2) of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956,” the Bench held.The Bench was hearing the MCI's challenge to the Rajasthan High Court judgment of September 2020 allowing the migration of student Anchal Parihar and holding that the term 'migration' used in the Rules is not limited to the Medical Council of India Act but it is much wider in scope.“The term 'migration' cannot be read out of context without reference to the Regulation which clearly provides that both colleges should be recognised u/s 11(2) of the Act. Admittedly, the college in which the first respondent is studying is yet to be recognised u/s 11(2) of the Act. Migration cannot be permitted contrary to the Regulations,” the top court held.Parihar was studying in Ananta Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Rajsamand, and she had requested the Board of Governors to permit her migration to Dr SN Medical College, Jodhpur, in 2019.The request was declined by the MCI on the ground that it was not permissible under the Migration Rules.The MCI, in its appeal, said the High Court had committed an error in interpreting the regulation as the migration of a student pursuing an undergraduate medical course was permissible only if both the colleges are recognised by the Central Government under section 11(2) of the Indian Medical Council Act.

I was there in the South and I know how difficult it is to spend on travel and appear in distant courts. Success rate at admission stage is 20%... At that (admission) stage it can be through virtual mode.”Justice Kaul’s comment – that came during hearing on a petition filed by Facebook India chief Ajit Mohan challenging the summons issued to him by Delhi Assembly’s Peace and Harmony Committee with regard to 2020 Delhi riots. The hearing remained inconclusive and would resume on February 9.Functioning only in the virtual mode since March last year, the Supreme Court was in the process of shifting to physical hearing in a hybrid manner as the health hazards posed by COVID-19 pandemic were not completely ruled out.On Thursday, lawyers and clerks were allowed to have access to the top court’s library, bar lounge, canteens, Registry and chambers from February 8.Amid protest by several advocates demanding resumption of full physical hearing in the Supreme Court, Chief Justice of India SA Bobde had on Monday told the bar leaders that physical hearing in ‘hybrid mode’ was on the cards.The issue was discussed in a meeting the CJI had with Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, bar leaders including Mishra, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) office bearers, Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association leaders and senior advocate and former SCBA president Vikas Singh on Monday.However, a section of lawyers led by former Supreme Court Bar Association President Vikas Singh are demanding full-fledged physical hearing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hybrid-mode-sc-says-cases-at-admission-stage-to-be-heard-virtually-207957

SFJ was outlawed under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in July last year.Pannun has since been sending phone-recorded messages, mainly from California, to officials, politicians and the civil society. Congress and Akali Dal leaders from Punjab have called him a paper tiger and point out that the call for a referendum flopped so badly that it had to be “postponed”.However, the MEA did not answer whether India had sought extradition of alleged Khalistani terrorists from Canada and the US where demonstration before Indian embassies and consulates have been aggressive and intimidatory.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/legal-request-issued-to-us-against-sikhs-for-justice-mea-207956

All the deceased belonged to the same family. The victims have been identified as Rukhminibai (36), her daughter Aarti (8), Rukhminibai’s co-sister Rajeshwari (30) and her daughter Keerthi (6). The police said that two mothers had gone along with their daughters to the village pond to wash clothes when one small girl Keerthi slipped and fell in the pond.

A small girl aged about six years accidentally fell into the pond first and in an attempt to save that girl, her mother also drowned. The other mother and daughter too tried to save the first mother and daughter but unfortunately met the same fate.” Since there was no one else at the pond at that time no timely help could reach the deceased.

04-02-2021||New Delhi||Rihanna: Woman who has India agog is more than just cult pop star||Leaping from playlists to front pages, Rihanna has made the transition from the cult pop star who has much of young, upper class urban India dancing to her songs to the global celebrity all of India can’t stop talking about – or finding out more about. Is she Rihanna or Reeyanna? What is her nationality? Exactly how popular is she? The questions on the Barbados-born US singer, who set the international ball rolling on India’s farm protests with her tweet backing the farmers, did the frantic rounds.On Tuesday night, Rihanna, one of the biggest pop stars of the day, had many in a tizzy when she shared a CNN report over the Internet shutdown at the protest sites at Delhi border. “Why aren’t we talking about this? #FarmersProtest,” the 33-year-old singer tweeted.Rihanna, who has frequently spoken out on issues such as LGBTQIA+ rights and racism, is the fourth most followed person, with 101.3 million followers, on Twitter after former US President Barack Obama and singers Justin Bieber and Katy Perry. Her tweet on India’s farmers received hundreds of thousands retweets and likes.It led to a wave of support for the farmers from several global celebrities, activists and politicians, including climate activist Greta Thunberg, American lawyer and US Vice President Kamala Harris’ niece Meena Harris, actor Amanda Cerny, singers Jay Sean and Hollywood star John Cusack. The “Umbrella” and “Diamond” singer also saw a jump in her Twitter following – going from 100 million to 101.3 million in two days.She was suddenly the talk of town everywhere in India. The controversy triggered by the tweet also evoked a strong response from the Ministry of External Affairs, which said the “temptation of sensationalist social media hashtags and comments” is neither accurate nor responsible.Using the hashtags #IndiaTogether and #IndiaAgainstPropaganda that were used in the MEA statement, the government’s pushback found support from several top ministers, Bollywood and sports personalities.And people who didn’t know or have any interest in her kind of music were overnight trying to find out more and listen more to understand more about the woman behind the tweet.On the day she posted about the internet clampdown at farmers’ protest, Rihanna also spoke against the military coup in India’s neighbouring country Myanmar.“My prayers are with you #myanmar!” the singer tweeted while sharing a post by Human Rights Watch.Rihanna’s support to farmers’ protests and solidarity with the people of Myanmar isn’t a case of sudden activism.She has been vocal about issues such as LGBTQIA+ rights, children education and racism since her teen years.Born on February 20, 1988 in Saint Michael, Barbados, to accountant Monica and warehouse supervisor Ronald Fenty, Rihanna was just 18 when she created Believe Foundation to help terminally ill children.In 2012, she launched the Clara Lionel Foundation, which supports and funds education and health programmes around the world.She also became the first global ambassador for the Global Partnership for Education, using her voice to advocate for support for education programmes.In 2017, the singer criticised fashion firms who hire models from minority groups as a “token” gesture.“I’ve had the pleasure of working with many gifted trans women over the years but I don’t go around doing trans castings! I respect all women. Whether they’re trans or not is none of my business.“I don’t think it’s fair that a trans woman, or man, be used as a convenient marketing tool. Too often I see companies doing this to trans and black women alike. There’s always just that one spot in the campaign for the token ‘we look mad diverse’ girl/guy! It’s sad!,” the singer, who owns the popular skin colour and gender inclusive cosmetics label Fenty, had said in response to a fan query on Twitter.Rihanna was also among the major voices in showbiz when the US was rocked by protests over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota in May last year.At the height of the coronavirus pandemic in April last year, the singer made an earnest appeal to her fans, saying that she isn’t working on her latest album as her prime focus right now is doing her bit in saving the world from the pandemic.The Grammy winner, one of the richest musicians ever with a net worth pegged at USD 600 million, was one of the first famous personalities who pledged support towards the relief efforts in fighting the COVID-19 outbreak.Rihanna’s non-profit organisation Clara Lionel Foundation donated USD 2.1 million to help victims of domestic violence in Los Angeles during the COVID-19 stay-at-home order.Her foundation also pledged USD 2 million to support undocumented workers, the incarcerated, homeless and elderly populations, and children of frontline healthcare workers in Los Angeles and New York City amid the  pandemic.While she received bouquets for her humanitarian and advocacy work, she has also courted controversies over the years.Rihanna’s 2010 song “Love The Way You Lie” kicked off a controversy over its problematic lyrics that many people believed glamourised domestic abuse.The song featured the lyrics “I Like The Way It Hurts” that people found to be odd due to Rihanna being herself a victim of domestic abuse in 2009 when she was in a relationship with singer-songwriter Chris Brown.The video of another track, “B**** Better Have My Money” ignited an intense debate about feminism, violence and race.The “Please Don’t Stop The Music” singer had reportedly also faced flak for her photo shoot in front of Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in 2013.It was reported that the mosque management had asked her to leave the premises after they felt that some of the photographs she took “were not in compliance with the terms of the mosque”.Most recently, the singer had to apologise for using a controversial song at her latest Savage X Fenty fashion show.She had received backlash online for using the song “Doom” by artist Coucou Chloe, which includes a Muslim text known as a Hadith.Rihanna had said the use of the song was “irresponsible” and called it an “honest, yet careless mistake”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rihanna-woman-who-has-india-agog-is-more-than-just-cult-pop-star-207943
04-02-2021||Chennai||We briefly discussed it in team meeting: Kohli on farmers' protest||India captain Virat Kohli on Thursday said the ongoing farmers' protest against new agriculture laws did come up for discussion in his team meeting where everyone had "expressed what they had to".Kohli, speaking online to the media ahead of the first Test against England here, did not divulge the details of the "brief" conversation on the matter."Like any issue present in the country, we do talk about it and everyone had expressed what they had to," Kohli said when asked about the agitation that has been going on for over two months."That's about it. We briefly spoke about it in the team meeting and we carried on discussing the team and game plans," he added.On Wednesday, Kohli was among a host of Indian cricket stars, including the iconic Sachin Tendulkar, who urged for unity in the country after some international celebrities like US pop star Rihanna called attention to the plight of the agitating farmers on social media."Let us all stay united in this hour of disagreements. Farmers are an integral part of our country and I'm sure an amicable solution will be found between all parties to bring about peace and move forward together," he had tweeted.India and England will lock horns in a four-match Test series starting Friday.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi's borders for over two months demanding that the three new farm laws be repealed.Farmer groups have alleged that these laws, which allow farmers to sell their produce directly to a buyer, would end the traditional mandi system and the guarantee of a Minimum Support Price for their crops.The government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.

04-02-2021||Mumbai||Kangana calls Taapsee Pannu ‘B-grade person’, ‘dumbo’ and ‘freeloader’||The cold war between Bollywood actresses Kangana Ranaut and Taapsee Pannu came to the forefront again on Thursday, with the two of them taking jibes at each other on social media.It all began with Taapsee taking a jibe at Kangana without mentioning her name. Taapsee posted a tweet saying we should not become ‘propaganda teacher’ for others.“If one tweet rattles your unity, one joke rattles your faith or one show rattles your religious belief then it’s you who has to work on strengthening your value system not become ‘propaganda teacher’ for others,” Taapsee tweeted.This comes a day after Kangana trolled international pop star Rihanna for commenting on the ongoing farmers’ protest in India.Even though Taapsee did not take names, Kangana seems to have taken her tweet as a personal attack, which is evident from the comments she made on Taapsee’s tweet. Kangana commented on Taapsee’s tweet using adjectives like “B-grade person”, “dumbo” and “freeloader”.Kangana commented in Hindi: “Teri maa ko main gali doon it will rattle your belief dumbo? National platforms pe uska apman karu... I know you will strengthen your love not do anything tabhi toh tere jaise dusaron ki rotiyon pe palne wale paltu hote hain...kabhi kuch aur nahin ban pate, chup kar aab. (Will it rattle your belief if I hurl abuses at your mother, dumbo? What if I insult her on national platforms? I know you will strengthen your love not do anything and that’s why people like you depend on others for their bread, just like pets. They cannot become anything else ever, so you better keep shut).”In another comment, Kangana wrote: “B grade logon ki B grade thinking, one should stand up for one’s faith motherland and family, yehi Karm hai yehi Dharm bhi hai .... free fund ka sirf khane wale mat bano... iss desh ka bojh... that’s why I call them B grade ... ignore them free loaders.

So far, as many as 43,91,826 — which is 45 per cent of the targeted number — have been vaccinated,” Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, adding that with sero-survey showing that majority people were vulnerable, there was no cause for complacency.The sero-survey was done between December 17 and January 8 in a general population of 28,589 and 7,171 health-care workers.“Same 700 villages, 70 districts and 21 states selected for the earlier two rounds of sero survey were chosen. As many as 100 healthcare workers per district were covered and we found sero prevalence in adults of 21.4 per cent, urban slums 31.7 per cent, non-urban slums 26.2 per cent and 19.1 per cent rural,” ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said.Health workers showed greater exposure of 25.7 per cent with 26.6 per cent in doctors and nurses.The ICMR said a good proportion was still vulnerable and people must practise COVID-appropriate behaviour.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/45-pc-of-target-health-workers-vaccinated-97-38-pc-satisfied-next-dose-on-feb-13-207929

I hope we can prevent any additional life from being lost. #FarmersProtest” Juju tweeted.Kuzma, who plays for the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA, also shared the same article Rihanna had posted.“Should be talking about this! #FarmersProtest,” the 25-year-old tweeted.Former NBA player Baron Davies also took to Twitter to highlight the farmers’ protest, urging people to spread awareness about the issue.“Are we going to address what’s happening in India ? Let my good people free !! Unfair to those who struggle, the farmers provide a way of living and they need to have a right to a way of life.“Join me and let’s bring awareness. #FarmersProtest,” he tweeted.Rihanna started the global chorus of support for India’s farmers on Tuesday.“Why aren’t we talking about this?! #FarmersProtest,” she had tweeted.Soon several international celebrities including teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg and US Vice President Kamala Harris’ niece Meena Harris too came out in support of the farmers’ protest.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at Delhi’s borders for over two months demanding repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee of minimum support price for their crops.Farmer unions have announced a countrywide blockade of national and state highways for three hours on Saturday when they would protest against the internet ban in areas near their agitation sites.Sites of the farmer protest at Delhi’s borders have turned into fortresses with police beefing up security and putting up multi-layer barricades to stop the movement of vehicles. Concertina wires have also been put up to keep off people on foot.The strengthened security measures come after the violence during the Republic Day tractor parade by the farmers.

The DDC elections had been held for the first time, he added.The dreams of former prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee; founder of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherje and Dr BR Ambedkar; Dr Syama Prasad Mukherjee and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had been fulfilled, he said.With regard to the farm laws, he said the Congress and other Opposition parties were adopting double standards.“The Congress, in its 2019 General Election manifesto, had promised to do away with the APMC Act,” he added.He condemned the violence in the name of farmers protest on Republic Day.Singh, on his turn, questioned Modi’s leadership, including the decision of demonitisation, the abrogation of Article 370 and the three farm laws, among others.He questioned the arrests of leaders of Kashmir following the abrogation of Article 370, and slapping of criminal cases against farmers and journalists during the ongoing protest against the farm laws.Singh said farm laws were passed the in Rajya Sabha without following the procedures.He said: “The Centre failed to take timely action against COVID-19 in order to host the then US president, Donald Trump, and to topple the Congress government and form its government in Madhya Pradesh.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/face-off-between-bjp-congress-in-rajya-sabha-scindia-digvijaya-singh-take-on-each-other-207926

I got a chance to talk to the farmers lodged in the jail and scribbled notes on my legs. I am going to write a detailed report."     "My work is to report from ground zero... I asked the farmers why and how they were arrested," he said.       Punia said he had been covering the protest at the Singhu border from the day it started. "It was my responsibility as a journalist to report it truthfully and faithfully. I was trying to do that. I was trying to find out the people behind the attack on the movement site. My work was interrupted by the arrest. I lost valuable time. I do feel that that I was wronged," he tweeted. He alleged that the police interfered with his work and said the incident had strengthened his resolve to continue with his work. Punia was arrested at the Singhu border on charges of "obstructing public servants in discharge of public functions", "assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty", and "voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty". He was sent to 14-day judicial custody on Sunday by the court of metropolitan magistrate.       However, he was granted bail on Tuesday after furnishing a personal bond of Rs 25,000.

Last month, the actor's handle was briefly suspended after she posted a tweet in reference to the controversy surrounding Amazon Prime Video series ‘Tandav’.In the tweet, the actor had used the phrase "time to take their heads off", which was reported by many users as offensive.Ranaut has been actively posting on Twitter since Tuesday when international pop star Rihanna came out in support of the farmers' agitation.The actor also went after actor Taapsee Pannu for her tweets but was criticised for her language.Responding to the flurry of tweets from prominent celebrities from Bollywood and sports following Rihanna's tweet, Pannu on Thursday said, "If one tweet rattles your unity, one joke rattles your faith or one show rattles your religious belief then it's you who has to work on strengthening your value system not become ‘propaganda teacher' for others."It was enough to tick off Ranaut who called Pannu “a sasta copy” (cheap replica) and also dragged the actor’s mother in the conversation.Ranaut was the first to slam Rihanna for her post, calling her a "fool" and protesting farmers "terrorists".She was also embroiled in a second Twitter spat with Diljit Dosanjh, who released a track appreciating Rihanna.

04-02-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||Heightened vaccine diplomacy to neutralise negative perception||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 4India will try to neutralise the adverse perception from the farm agitation with stepped-up Covid diplomacy. The Government will try to accommodate as many as possible of the 65 formal requests from countries for Covid vaccines, said officials.At the same time, diplomats have been reaching out to their counterparts to explain the farm laws’ favourable effect on investments in agriculture. This aspect got reflected in the US State Department’s observations on the subject broadly favouring the intention behind the farm laws.India is already manufacturing a UK-developed vaccine, which India has exported free as well as on a commercial basis. In fact, even low- income countries are seeing vaccines from India on a commercial basis, said officials.A Russian vaccine, currently undergoing Phase 3 trials, could be in the market by April. Sputnik vaccine is expected to be distributed not only in Russia, but in many Shanghai Cooperation Organisation members too. Bharat Biotech’s vaccine is also in the end stage of Phase 3 trials and will be in the market once it gets regulatory clearances.In addition, countries are interested in at least three more vaccines undergoing trials and the development of a second wave of vaccine.India will be building on the goodwill it earned during the worldwide peak of the Covid epidemic last year when it supplied medicines, PPE kits and medical equipment to a large number of countries.An empowered committee of top officials–secretaries from the Ministries of External Affairs, Commerce, Health and Finance (Expenditure)–is making periodical evaluation of the domestic supply position and all other associated factors before clearing exports of the vaccines.The export of the latest lot would be majorly directed towards African countries, said officials.“This has generated a lot of goodwill. We have proved that India is the pharmacy of the world. Vaccines’ export will prove that we are also the vaccine capital of the world,” they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/heightened-vaccine-diplomacy-to-neutralise-negative-perception-207900

It examined the impact of the pandemic on both brand value rankings and the celebrity endorsement space.With a valuation of USD 51.1 million, Shah Rukh Khan has improved his ranking by a notch to the fourth slot in 2020, while Deepika Padukone is the fifth most valued celeb with USD 50.4 million but down from the third slot in 2019; Alia Bhatt has improved to sixth slot from seventh in 2019 with USD 48 million.Ayushmann Khurrana has moved up four notches to the sixth rank with valuation of USD 48 million, but Salman Khan slipped two notches to the eighth slot with a value of USD 45 million, while Amitabh Bachchan is ninth (USD 44.2 million) and Hrithik Roshan is ranked 10th (USD 39.4).“While established celebrities continue to dominate the rankings, notable millennials with a strong social media presence continue to climb the ladder. Ayushmann Khurrana, Tiger Shroff and Rohit Sharma jumped a few spots to the sixth, 15th and 17th ranks, respectively, and Kartik Aaryan debuts on the list at 20th.“These rising millennial celebrities were in greater demand during the pandemic owing to their popularity among the youth,” Aviral Jain, managing director of Duff & Phelps said.In 2020 , the media and entertainment sector took a hit and witnessed significant slowdown in advertising spends as traditional media and outdoor entertainment were severely impacted by the pandemic. Digital marginally overtook print to become the second largest segment in the advertisement space, and it continues to witness traction among brands, according to Jain.

While stating that various schemes had been unveiled for supporting academic projects on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of Independence, Modi appealed to scholars to write books on the Chauri Chaura incident.“People know it simply as an incident in which the agitators set a police station on fire. Actually, fire was burning in the hearts of the protesters,” Modi said.The Prime Minister said 19 people were executed by the British to avenge the killing of the police personnel at Chauri Chaura. Only on rare occasions so many freedom fighters were executed in connection with a single incident, Modi said.Modi named Baba Raghav Das, spiritual guru-turned freedom fighter, and Madan Mohan Malaviya, founder president of Hindu Mahasabha and Congress leader, saying the intervention by these two had saved the lives of a number of others lined up for execution by the British following the incident.The incident was a huge inspiration for the freedom movement, Modi said in the function which was attended by a large number of schoolchildren besides others. Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel also took part in the function from Lucknow through video-conferencing.On Wednesday, 1.4 lakh students from across 75 districts of the state sang “Vande Mataram” in unison while standing in a salute pose to commemorate the centenary of the incident.Modi on Thursday also released a postage stamp issued by the Department of Posts in memory of the incident.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-blacks-out-gandhi-while-speaking-on-chauri-chaura-centenary-207882

04-02-2021||New Delhi||India falls to 53rd position in EIU’s Democracy Index||India slipped two places to 53rd position in the 2020 Democracy Index’s global ranking, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit, which said the “democratic backsliding” by authorities and “crackdowns” on civil liberties has led to a further decline in the country’s ranking.However, India is ranked higher than most of its neighbouring countries.India’s overall score fell from 6.9 in 2019 to 6.61 in the Index that provides a snapshot of the current state of democracy worldwide for 167 countries.“With mounting pressure on India’s democratic norms, India’s score fell from a peak of 7.92 in 2014 to 6.61 in 2020 and its global ranking slipped from 27th (in 2014) to 53rd as a result of democratic backsliding” under the current regime, The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) said.Norway topped The Economist Intelligence Unit’s latest Democracy Index report titled “Democracy in sickness and in health?”, with Iceland, Sweden, New Zealand and Canada making up the top five.Out of 167 countries, the Democracy Index classifies 23 countries as full democracies, 52 as flawed democracies, 35 as hybrid regimes and 57 as authoritarian regimes. India has been classified as a ‘flawed democracy’ along with countries such as the US, France, Belgium and Brazil.The EIU report said in India and Thailand, “democratic backsliding by the authorities and crackdowns on civil liberties led to a further decline in their global rankings”.It further alleged that the Narendra Modi-led government had “introduced a religious element to the conceptualisation of Indian citizenship, a step that many critics see as undermining the secular basis of the Indian state”.“The authorities’ handling of the coronavirus pandemic led to a further erosion of civil liberties in 2020,” the report said.India was ranked 51st in the 2019 Democracy Index.Among India’s neighbours, while Sri Lanka, at 68th rank, is classified as a flawed democracy, Bangladesh (76), Bhutan (84) and Pakistan (105) are classified in the ‘hybrid regime’ category. Afghanistan is ranked 139th and classified as an ‘authoritarian regime’ in the index.The EIU report looks at the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on freedom and democracy around the world.The Asia and Australasia region includes top-scoring New Zealand, which retained its fourth position in the global ranking (out of 167 countries), and persistent laggard North Korea at the bottom of the global ranking in 167th place, the EIU said in a statement.The region’s overall score fell in 2020 but it now has five “full democracies” with Japan, South Korea and Taiwan moving up the rankings compared with 2019.Australia retains its “full democracy” status and high ranking (9th).Japan and South Korea both returned to the “full democracy” fold for the first time since 2014. Taiwan attained “full democracy” status for the first time following a spectacular jump up the rankings.Despite these upgrades, Asia’s average regional score deteriorated to its lowest level since 2013 as official measures taken to combat the coronavirus pandemic led to some of the most severe constraints on individual freedoms and civil liberties in the world, the EIU said.China, Singapore and others went much further than the rest of the world in tracking and policing their citizens and locking them down in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it said.Joan Hoey, Editor of The Economist Intelligence Unit’s annual Democracy Index report, said: “The symbolism of Asia gaining three new ‘full democracies’ in 2020 and western Europe losing two (France and Portugal) was apt, as the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the shift in the global balance of power from the West to the East.”“Asia continues to lag behind the West in democratic terms having only five ‘full democracies’, compared with western Europe’s 13 but the region has, so far, handled the pandemic much better than virtually any other, with lower infection and mortality rates and a fast economic rebound,” she said.Asian governments reacted decisively (albeit deploying coercive powers in some cases), benefited from well-organised health systems and retained the confidence of their populations, she said.By contrast, European governments were slow to act, some health systems came close to collapse and public trust in government declined, Hoey added.The Economist Intelligence Unit (The EIU) was the world’s leading resource for economic and business research, forecasting and analysis, a statement said.

04-02-2021||New Delhi||Recovered Covid patients may need only one shot of mRNA vaccines, say scientists||People who have recovered from the novel coronavirus infection may need only one shot as opposed to the recommended two jabs if they are taking the Moderna or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines, according to a study which suggests ways to minimise doses when supplies are limited.The yet-to-be peer-reviewed study, posted in the preprint repository medRxiv, assessed the antibody responses in 109 individuals with and without documented pre-existing immunity to the novel coronavirus.According to the researchers, including Florian Krammer from the Icahn School of Medicine in the US, a single dose of mRNA vaccine elicits very rapid immune responses in individuals already possessing antibodies against the coronavirus from previous exposure to it."For individuals with pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 the first vaccine dose likely immunologically resembles the booster dose in naive individuals," the scientists wrote in the study.In the research, the scientists analysed mRNA vaccines which use segments of the viral genetic material to enable human cells to make the coronavirus spike proteins.These proteins train the immune system of vaccine recipients to fight the actual infectious coronavirus when their body encounters the pathogen.The scientists said the post-vaccine antibody levels in recovered Covid patients are comparable to, or exceed levels, found in those without prior exposure to the virus who received two vaccinations.Another yet-to-be peer-reviewed study in medRxiv also studied antibody responses to a single dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines in health-care workers who had previously recovered from the infection.It found that their antibody levels started peaking at seven days since immunisation, and achieved higher titers and neutralisation in 14 days compared to volunteers exposed to the vaccine for the first time."Although we did not have peak titers for these individuals after natural infection, the titers developed after single vaccination was higher than peak titers in inpatients and outpatients with COVID-19, similar to what has been described in primary vaccination after two doses of the spike-based mRNA vaccines," the researchers wrote in the study.According to the scientists from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in the US, the secondary response occurs through activation of the immune system's memory B cells.Based on the findings, the researchers recommend a strategy of single dose vaccination for patients who have already had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.They said those who had recovered from the disease could be placed lower on the vaccination priority list.Commenting on the two studies, Eleanor Riley, Professor of Immunology and Infectious Disease at the University of Edinburgh in the UK, said the findings are "very reassuring", adding that the vaccines are "very effectively boosting the immunity induced by infection".While the two studies suggest that people who have had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection may only require one dose of the vaccine, Riley, who was unrelated to the studies, said incorporating this into a mass vaccination programme may be logistically complex.He believes it may be safer to ensure that everyone gets two doses.The preprint platfrom, medRxiv, also cautions that the posted reports are preliminary in nature and have not been certified by peer review."They should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behaviour," it adds.Lawrence Young, Virologist and Professor of Molecular Oncology, University of Warwick in the UK, believes this question can be resolved with further studies."...we should be doing further studies which look at giving previously infected individuals one dose of an mRNA vaccine," said Young, who was also unrelated to the two studies."If future work can confirm this high level of immunity post a single mRNA vaccine in this group of individuals, this could become a viable option when there are concerns around vaccine supply," he added in a statement.

He is said to have had an earlier affiliation with and to maintain familial ties to the Haqqani network,” the UNSG's report said.The Haqqani network, which has the backing of elements within the Pakistani security establishment, is one of Afghanistan's most experienced and sophisticated insurgent organisations, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based non-partisan, non-profit, public policy research organisation.The Haqqani network maintains a safe haven in North Waziristan, Pakistan, across Afghanistan's southeastern border, it said. The extremist group has been behind some of the deadliest attacks across Afghanistan against US interests in the war-torn country.It said that online recruitment and radicalisation of ISIL sympathisers in South Asia continues to be a “concern, in particular through propaganda publications targeting followers, including in the Maldives and Sri Lanka”.The Secretary General's report said that ISIL also remains resilient in South-East Asia with a number of factions, in particular in the southern Philippines, giving special urgency to initiatives developed by authorities in the region, including the promotion of narratives to counter violent extremism online.

Later, his name was included in the revenue records, the petitioners have said.However, his name was struck down from the records against which their father filed an appeal before the Additional Commissioner, Ayodhya, which was allowed, they have claimed.The petitioners further claimed that the consolidation officer again removed their father's name from the records during consolidation proceedings.Against the order of the consolidation officer, an appeal was preferred before the Settlement Officer of Consolidation, Sadar, Ayodhya, but without considering the said petition, the authorities have allotted five-acre of their 28-acre land to the Waqf Board for the constructing of mosque, they said.The petitioners have demanded the authorities be restrained from transferring the land to the Sunni Waqf Board till the pendency of dispute before the settlement officer.The state government has allotted five-acre land to the Sunni Waqf Board in Dhannipur village for construction of mosque in compliance with Supreme Court direction on November 7, 2019 in the Ram Janmabhoomi- Babri mosque title suit.

He said, “The farmers do not want suspension of farm laws, they want repeal and will not retreat. The government will have to retreat, the sooner the better.” Patra attacked Rahul for “firing from the farmers’ shoulders and inciting them” and said Rahul and Rihanna spoke out of ignorance and both were clueless about rabi crops. Rahul earlier attacked the PM asking him to “do his job”.“Your job is to protect farmers. Give them a hug and ask what you can do for them,” he said, noting that India’s global reputation had taken a hit because of the government’s attitude towards farmers and journalists.“Our strength, our soft power has been shattered by the BJP and the RSS,” said Rahul, asking why the Centre had fortified Delhi.“Are you afraid of farmers?” he posed saying “India is lacking in leadership,” a charge Patra retorted with another jibe: “If anyone is lacking in leadership it is the Congress.”The Congress ex-chief also attacked the government for allegedly branding farmers as anti-nationals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-image-has-taken-a-hit-rahul-on-farmer-stir-207686

Later, Shah tweeted, “No propaganda can deter India’s unity! No propaganda can stop India from attaining new heights!” Ministers Piyush Goyal and Smriti Irani and celebrities Karan Johar, Ajay Devgan and Akshay Kumar also tweeted with hashtags “Indiatogether and “India against propaganda”.The Motion of Thanks on President’s Address, which Kalita moved, saw 118 amendments by opposition MPs, including DMK’s Tiruchi Siva and Congress’ Digvijay Singh, Deepender Singh Hooda and KC Venugopal. The RS allocated 15 hours for the debate after the Opposition and the government agreed to extend it beyond the scheduled 10 hours to include time for discussion on farmers’ issues.Kalita, former Congress chief whip in the RS, said the new laws would give new rights to farmers and doors were open for them to amicably resolve the issue. The BJP’s Vijaypal Singh Tomar, who seconded the motion, listed 12 expert committees that deliberated upon the farm reforms for two decades. Speaking in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Tomar slammed the Opposition for “spreading misinformation” and said the new laws would empower small farmers and help their children become job providers.Opening the debate from the other side, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad insisted on repeal of laws saying that the “government should not make it a prestige issue”.“There can be nothing better than the PM himself announcing the decision to withdraw the laws,” said Azad, asking the Centre to form a committee to locate “people who had gone missing after the Republic Day violence”.“We condemn what happened on January 26, particularly at the Red Fort but please ensure innocent farmer leaders are not implicated or the agitation will swell,” he warned.Demanding farm law repeal, SP’s Ram Gopal Yadav cautioned the government against corporate monopoly over farm produce.The Lok Sabha proceedings, meanwhile, were adjourned repeatedly on Wednesday as the protesting opposition members demanded a separate discussion on farm laws.The House reassembled thrice, only to again adjourn till 5 pm, then 7 pm and later till 9 pm as the Opposition continued its protest despite repeated assurances by the Speaker that the members would get adequate opportunity to put forward their views.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-stand-on-prestige-oppn-clamours-for-farm-law-repeal-207575

04-02-2021||New Delhi||Parliament panel endorses DNA profiling Bill, but with riders||The parliamentary standing committee on science and technology on Wednesday endorsed The DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill-2019 that seeks to regulate the use of DNA in solving heinous crimes, finding missing persons and identifying disaster victims, but proposed key riders.GOVERNMENT TAKEIn its report to Parliament, the committee headed by Congress’ Jairam Ramesh differed with the government on the definition of DNA profiling and the composition of DNA Regulatory Body which it said must be headed by an independent genetic expert rather than a union secretary, as currently proposed in the Bill.CAN’T RULE OUT CASTE PROFILING: OWAISIThe panel has recommended deletion of government’s definition of DNA profile – “DNA profile is the result of analysis of a DNA sample for establishing human identification” – and proposed a new definition that says “DNA profile means a DNA pattern that establishes only the genetic identity of offenders, missing persons or unknown deceased persons, and not their characteristics such as physical appearance, behaviour or health status”.The panel’s major suggestions include rephrasing the Bill as The DNA (Use and Application in Justice Delivery System) Regulation Bill, 2021; deleting clauses for establishing regional data banks (panel says National DNA databank is enough for DNA storage); DNA collection from arrested persons only after they are personally heard by a magistrate rather than on written consent as currently proposed.The Bill allows creation of national and regional DNA banks to store biological information of persons under five indices — crime scene index; suspects or undertrials index; offenders index; missing persons and unknown deceased persons index.Justifying the draft law, the government says DNA technology has the potential of wide application in the justice delivery systems and investigation of crimes through biological evidence — semen in rape cases, blood in murder cases, saliva in case of anonymous threats. “Several crimes are committed by repeat offenders. Their apprehension will be aided by comparison of biological evidence at the scene of crime with DNA profiles stored in a DNA Data Bank. In civil cases, DNA evidence helps in identifying disaster victims besides aiding in finding missing persons,” the draft Bill states.The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reports 40,000 unidentified bodies per year and 1,00,000 missing children annually.
