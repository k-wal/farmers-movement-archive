14-02-2021||New Delhi||Man’s amputated hand rejoined in challenging surgery at Delhi hospital||Doctors at a leading private hospital here have rejoined the amputated hand of a man after he suffered an accident at a factory in Prahaladpur industrial area in Delhi, hospital authorities said on Sunday.The 36-year-old man, Inderpal, was working at the factory in Badli area on January 21, when around 2 PM suddenly a heavy object from the machine fell on his hand and his left forearm got crushed and amputated, they said.He was taken to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.“Patient suffered severe pain, loss of blood and went into shock. His employer, being a good samaritan, did not hesitate in taking the patient immediately to the hospital. Further, he showed presence of mind and collected the amputated hand, well preserved in ice. By 4 pm, two hours after the accident, Inderpal was in the emergency ward,” the hospital said in a statement.According to Anubhav Gupta, Senior Consultant, Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, at the facility, “Though the patient reached us well within the golden time period (usually 3-4 hours over ice in forearm level injury), it was challenging as the forearm at the time of amputation had got badly pulled and crushed”.This led to multiple-level injuries to various structures (bone, muscles, nerves and vessels), necessitating a holistic approach requiring extensive shortening and graft usage from different parts of the body, he said.“As time was the essence, we decided to take the patient immediately for a surgery without waiting for COVID-19 test result, which came negative later,” the hospital said.Due to the severity of the injury, it took over six hours to perform the implantation of the forearm using micro-vascular technique, it said.At present, the patient’s hand has been successfully salvaged and he hopes to have a good hand functional recovery, doctors said.Gupta added that with the latest surgical techniques it is now possible to rejoin even the worst amputated limbs if they are brought in time and well preserved in ice. It is important to understand that the amputated part should not be in direct contact of ice. It should be kept in a clean polythene over ice, he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mans-amputated-hand-rejoined-in-challenging-surgery-at-delhi-hospital-212399
14-02-2021||New Delhi||Bihar polls: SC issues notice to CEC, leaders of political parties for failure to publish criminal antecedents of candidates||The Supreme Court has issued notices to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora and leaders of various political parties on a contempt petition highlighting their alleged failure to publish the criminal antecedents of candidates as ordered by the court in the November 2020 Bihar Assembly polls.A Bench headed by Justice Rohinton F Nariman asked the CEC, Bihar Chief Electoral Officer HR Srinivas, BJP Organising Secretary BL Santosh, JDU General Secretary KC Tyagi, Bihar RJD president Jagdanand Singh, LJP’s Abdul Khalik and Congress leader RS Surjewala.While issuing notice on a contempt petition filed by advocate Brajesh Singh, the top court dispensed with the personal appearance of the contemnors. It posted the matter for further hearing on March 9.Taking note of alarming rise in number of tainted lawmakers, the Supreme Court on February 13 last year ordered political parties to upload details of pending criminal cases against their candidates, the reasons for their selection, excluding those without criminal antecedents.These details were required to be published within 48 hours of the selection of the candidate or at least two weeks before commencement of filing of nominations, whichever is earlier.Petitioner Brajesh Singh alleged that the top court’s order was not followed as criminal antecedents of candidates were not published by political parties.In its February 13, 2020 order, a Bench led by Justice Nariman had directed political parties to publish such details on their official social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter as also in one local vernacular and one national newspaper.It had also asked political parties to give reasons for selecting candidates having pending criminal cases with reference to their qualifications, achievements and merit and not merely on “winnability”.Failure to submit the compliance report by political parties to the Election Commission will attract contempt action against them as the top court said the poll panel “shall bring such non-compliance” to its notice.“On a perusal of the documents placed on record and after submissions of counsel, it appears that over the last four general elections, there has been an alarming increase in the incidence of criminals in politics. In 2004, 24 per cent of the Members of Parliament had criminal cases pending against them; in 2009, that went up to 30 per cent; in 2014 to 34 per cent; and in 2019 as many as 43 per cent of MPs had criminal cases pending against them,” the Bench had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-polls-sc-issues-notice-to-cec-leaders-of-political-parties-for-failure-to-publish-criminal-antecedents-of-candidates-212398

14-02-2021||New Delhi||Farmer unions condemn arrest of Disha Ravi in toolkit case, demands her immediate release||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmers’ unions, on Sunday condemned the arrest of 22-year-old climate activist Disha Ravi by the Delhi Police during their probe into toolkit document case and demanded her immediate release.It also condemned Haryana Agriculture Minister J P Dalal’s comment on death of farmers protesting the three contentious farm laws and warned that people would teach him a lesson for such “arrogance”.“The government has shamelessly admitted in Parliament that it has no data of the farmers who sacrificed their lives in the ongoing movement,” said the statement issued by SKM leader Darshan Pal.“The SKM is maintaining a blog site where such data is readily available if the government cares. It is the same callousness which resulted in the loss of lives so far.” Condemning Ravi’s arrest, the SKM said she “stood in support of the farmers”.“We demand her immediate unconditional release,” SKM said in the statement.Ravi was arrested from Bengaluru by a Cyber Cell team of the Delhi Police on Saturday for allegedly sharing with Swedish teen climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg the “toolkit” related to the farmer’s protest against the Centre’s three agri laws.The police claimed Ravi was an editor of the “toolkit Google doc” and a “key conspirator” in the document’s formulation and dissemination. She and others “collaborated with pro-Khalistani Poetic Justice Foundation to spread disaffection against the Indian State”, police alleged. At a mahapanchayat held at Indri in Karnal district of Haryana, SKM leaders warned that the BJP’s days are “numbered as more and more farmers are getting awakened”.“Farmers’ resolve to fight unitedly, cutting across states and religions, is getting stronger with each mahapanchayat despite the government’s divisive efforts. Rural India and agriculture is the main agenda for us,” they said.Candle marches being organised in villages and towns across the nation between 7 and 8 pm on Sunday, in support of the farmers’ demand for scrapping the agri laws and legal guarantee for minimum support price for crops.More farmers are expected to join the protest sites in the coming days and make the movement formidably strong, the SKM said.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and UP are protesting against farm laws at Delhi’s border points for more than 80 days. The stalemate continues despite 11 rounds of talks between the farmer leaders and the government.

We all felt good”.“But the statement made by former Chief Justice of India, who has been now sent to Parliament, is a very shocking kind of a statement. I do not know if he tried to explain the truth of judiciary.”           The NCP patriarch added that the remarks made by Gogoi are “worrisome” for all.Pawar was speaking to reporters at the musical event ‘Khayal Yagya’ organised to celebrate the birth centenary of Pandit Bhimsen Joshi.Talking to mediapersons in Nashik, Sanjay Raut said Gogoi was making the remarks after being a part of the judiciary for years.“Gogoi’s remarks should be taken seriously. There is a precedent that the judiciary shouldn’t be criticised... Had Gogoi explained with examples during his tenure as to why he thinks so, the country would have been enlightened”.“But he is a Rajya Sabha member with BJP’s blessings...You have been part of the judiciary for several years and after retirement, you say this,” the Sena MP added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gogois-remarks-on-judiciary-shocking-worrisome-sharad-pawar-212390
14-02-2021||Guwahati||Rahul Gandhi takes advice from Arabic speaking people: Himanta||Senior Assam minister Himanta   Biswa Sarma on Sunday claimed that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi takes advice from “Arabic speaking people”, apparently hinting at AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal, and that is why his first election rally in the state was “wasted”.The Congress has teamed up with the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and four other political parties to form a Grand Alliance against the ruling BJP for the assembly election in the state due in March-April.Sarma, the convenor of the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), the regional arm of NDA, also dared the Congress to take a stand against illegal Muslim immigrants.Talking to reporters on the sidelines of an official function in Guwahati, the BJP leader claimed that the capacity of Boarding field in Sivasagar district, where Gandhi addressed a public rally during the day, is about 12,000- 15,000 people, indicating that it was not well-attended.A Congress spokesperson, however, asserted that over 50,000 people gathered at Boarding field for the rally of Gandhi, who said that his party will protect every principle of the Assam Accord and will never implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act if voted to power in the state.“He (Gandhi) could have addressed the rally through a video conference. He came by a chartered flight, then took a chopper to reach the venue. The CRPF cover was there, administration people worked tirelessly for it. So, it was an expense of around Rs 35 lakh. And I feel this money is wasted,” Sarma said.Sarma, who was once a close confidante of Gandhi while being in the Congress, said that he would have advised the Lok Sabha MP to visit the Kamakhya temple and ‘satras’ (Vaishnavite places of worship) at Batadrava and Majuli to meet people.“In this way, he would have met more people than he did in today’s rally. He is a busy man and has lots of important work like running the farmers’ protests. He is taking advice from the Arabic speaking people and that is why the plans have gone wrong,” he said.By “Arabic speaking people”, Sarma apparently meant Ajmal, the Lok Sabha member from Dhubri. His party, the AIUDF, has 14 MLAs, mostly from the minority Muslim dominated areas of Assam.“It would have been better if he was advised by Assamese people,” Sarma said.On the Congress’ ‘Assam Bachao Ahok’ bus yatra campaign across the state, the BJP leader said that the opposition party leaders are just enjoying the bus ride and moving around places.“They are saying ‘Assam Bachao’. But from whom Assam needs to be saved? From the immigrant Muslim people who came from Bangladesh and are destroying Assamese culture and identity, Sarma alleged.He also claimed that Congress leaders are encouraging those illegal immigrants.“So, how will Assam be saved? If they want to save Assam, let them take a stand against immigrant Muslims and say that they will protect Assamese culture,” Sarma said.To a question on the frequent visits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda to Assam, Sarma said that the Congress should not feel bad if the saffron party leaders meet the people of the state.“During the time of Congress, it had a culture of not meeting people. Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and JP Nadda have developed a culture of meeting people. After all, it is democracy. What is wrong in this?” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-takes-advice-from-arabic-speaking-people-himanta-212389
14-02-2021||Mumbai||Times Group sends legal notice to BARC, demands Rs 450 cr in damages||Media giant Times Group on Sunday said it has sent a legal notice to Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), alleging the TV rating agency "deliberately reduced" its English news channel's viewership at the behest of a rival launched in 2017 and demanded compensation of Rs 450 crore.The notice, which follows the probe by the city police into the fake TRP case, in which former officials from BARC and the Arnab Goswami-promoted Republic News have been arrested, was sent by MZM Legal LLP on behalf of Bennett, Coleman and Co (BCCL) on February 11. "Times Now's viewership numbers were deliberately and in a concerted manner, reduced for giving benefit to the newly launched Channel, which has considerably and adversely impacted the revenue, growth, reputation, goodwill and image of Times Now channel and the Times Group at the national and international level,” the notice, a copy of which was seen by PTI, said. It also said the BARC wilfully and deliberately did not take action on the findings of a July 2020 report commissioned following whistleblower allegations about TRP (television rating points) manipulation. When contacted, BARC declined to comment on the story. The notice said BARC should compensate Times Group with Rs 431 crore in damages and also pay back license fees of Rs 21.83 crore which has been paid by the group till date. The notice, which follows alleged chats between the arrested former chief executive of BARC Parto Dasgupta and Republic's promoter and editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, said BARC should also publish a statement stating that Times Now was the leader in the English news genre between 2017-2019. Mentioning details from the chat between Goswami and Dasgupta where both speak about suppressing Times Now's numbers, the notice also demanded the BARC to publish Acquisory Risk Consulting's forensic audit report dated July 24, 2020, and also initiate disciplinary action against errant broadcasters/channels and BARC officials involved in the fraudulent activities.Giving seven days time to comply, the legal notice warned that the media group will be constrained to adopt criminal and also civil action against the BARC. It also quoted from a press conference by the joint commissioner of police (crime) in December 2020, which said that apart from English news genre TRP manipulation also happened in the Telugu news channels category.  “The press conference makes it evidently clear that activities resulting in viewership malpractices and TRP manipulation were undertaken by BARC with a malafide intention to biasedly cause wrongful losses to some of its subscribers whilst other co-conspiring subscribers benefitted of the malicious acts,” the legal notice said.

An AQI in the “poor” range causes breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure, it states.The AQI for each city is based on the average value of all monitoring stations there. Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Noida have four such stations while Greater Noida and Faridabad have two stations each, according to the app. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-severe-in-ghaziabad-noida-very-poor-in-faridabad-212385
14-02-2021||Chennai||PM Modi forges ahead with Tamil culture pitch, sets stage for positive campaign in TN polls||Setting the stage for a positive campaign for the Tamil Nadu Assembly polls, likely in April, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday latched on to Tamil culture and justice for people and backed the aspirations of Sri Lankan Tamils.Signalling a united fight against the background of belligerence of expelled AIADMK leaders TTV Dhinakaran and his aunt VK Sasikala, Modi gestured to Chief Minister K Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam on the dias to join and lift hands with him.All smiles, the three leaders quickly interlocked their hands amid applause and the unmistakable political subtext of the event that saw the launch of completed infra projects and laying the foundation for new initiatives was not lost on anyone.“It is our honour to work towards preserving and celebrating the culture of Tamil Nadu. The culture of Tamil Nadu is popular globally,” said Modi, who had quoted from Tamil texts, including classic ‘Thirukkural’ several times in the past during different occasions.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had during his recent campaign in Tamil Nadu accused the BJP and Modi of showing ‘no respect’ to Tamil culture.While AIADMK and BJP have already announced that they would fight the assembly elections together, Sasikala’s camp, steered by  Dhinakaran, have been staking claim to the party and harping on its retrieval.Quoting verses of Tamil poet of yore, ‘Avvaiyar’, Modi said it was also an inspiration to the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ (Self-reliant India) goals. The popular lines underscore that water is the basic element that could lead to the nation’s prosperity.Stressing water conservation, the PM urged the people to do work towards that goal and underlined that it was not only a national issue, but also had global implications.“Always remember the mantra of per drop more crop, this will help future generations.”Laying the foundation stone for modernisation of 636 km-long Grand Anicut Canal System in Tamil Nadu’s Cauvery delta region, he said the Anicut “is a living testimony to our glorious past.”The plan would have a big impact and improve irrigation facilities for 2.27 lakh acres in the delta region and Thanjavur and Pudukottai districts shall gain specially, he said.“I want to appreciate the farmers of Tamil Nadu for record food grain production and good use of water resources.”    Hailing Tamil as the oldest language in the world, he quoted nationalist Tamil poet Mahakavi Subramaniya Bharathi’s famous lines that stressed on manufacturing domestically.Modi said the nation was inspired by the vision of the freedom fighter and has undertaken a massive effort to become self-reliant in the defence sector.One of the two defence corridors is in Tamil Nadu and it has already received investment commitments exceeding Rs 8,100 crore, he noted.“Today, I am proud to dedicate to the country one more warrior to protect our frontiers. I am proud to hand over the indigenously designed and manufactured Main Battle Tank Arjun Mark 1A. It also uses indigenous ammunition.”     Tamil Nadu, already a leading automobile manufacturing hub, has now evolved as the ‘Tank manufacturing hub’ of the nation.“A tank made in Tamil Nadu will be used in our northern borders to keep the nation safe. This showcases India’s united spirit  Bharat’s Ekta Darshan.”Modi said the Centre has accepted the Devendrakula Vellalar community’s demand to be listed only by their collective, traditional name of ‘Devendrakula Vellalar (DVR)’ and not by the names of seven sub-sects.Identifying himself with the community’s aspirations, he said their name ‘Devender’ rhymed with his name ‘Narendra,’ adding, “I understand their emotions.”The ruling AIADMK has backed and recommended the move.“Colonial rulers took away their pride and dignity. For decades nothing happened.” It was beyond change of name and it was about, “justice, dignity and opportunity,” for them.Praising the community, he said they celebrated harmony, friendship and brotherhood. “Theirs was a civilisational movement. It shows their self-confidence and self pride, Aatma Gaurav.”The Puthiya Thamizhagam had for a long time been demanding renaming the seven sects under a single heritage name of DVR and also had wanted delisting the caste from the list of Scheduled Castes.Asserting that his government had always taken care of the welfare of Sri Lankan Tamils, Modi said, “it is my honour to have been the only Indian PM to visit Jaffna.”Listing several development and welfare initiatives facilitated by the Centre for Tamils in Lanka, he said the issue of rights of Tamils have also been taken up by India with Sri Lanka.“We are always committed to ensuring that they live with equality, justice peace and dignity.”The projects he listed include 50,000 houses for displaced Tamils in North eastern Lanka, 4,000 tenements in plantation areas, a hospital, free ambulance services, and rebuilding the rail network there.“I feel happy to share that India has built the Jaffna Cultural Centre which we hope to open soon.”On the travails of Tamil Nadu fishermen, vis-a-vis Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister assured that his government always protected their rightful interests.The Centre has ensured early release, whenever fishermen were apprehended in Sri Lanka, he said.More than 1,600 fishermen have been released during the BJP-led government’s tenure and currently, there is no Indian fisherman in Sri Lankan custody.Also, 313 boats have also been released and “we are working for the return of the rest of the boats,” he said.Earlier, he began and ended his address with ‘Vankakkam’ and praised Chennai as a city full of energy and enthusiasm and a centre of knowledge and creativity. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-forges-ahead-with-tamil-culture-pitch-sets-stage-for-positive-campaign-in-tn-polls-212380

Making the tags compulsory would also help in ensuring that vehicles pass seamlessly through the toll plazas, as the fee payment would be done electronically.Replying to a query on FASTags, Gadkari said the government had extended FASTag registration date limit two-three times before and now, it would not be extended further. Now, everybody should immediately buy FASTags, he added.The FASTag registration has gone up to 90 per cent on some routes and only 10 per cent people are left.

14-02-2021||Dehradun||Rishiganga deluge may trigger fresh migration from hills||From devastating earthquakes to calamitous floods, natural disasters are bringing widespread death and destruction to the highly fragile hills of Uttarakhand.At a time when the horror of the Kedarnath tsunami has not dissipated completely, the Rishiganga deluge has created fresh fears in the minds of the people living in the high hills and may trigger a fresh wave of migration, which is considered as a highly sensitive issue.After the calamitous Kedarnath floods, hundreds of people from the ravaged areas like Agustmuni in Rudraprayag district migrated to Dehradun in the plains and elsewhere mainly due to safety reasons.Aruna Benjwal, chairperson of Agustmuni nagar panchayat, claimed that nearly 35 to 40 people have migrated to the plains from Silli village alone. "Scores of people have also made arrangements in such a way that they live in Dehradun during winter and come back to Kedarnath area in the summer," Kedarnath MLA Manoj Rawat said."When these types of disasters strike, it is very natural that the people may think of migrating to the plains," said S.S. Negi, Vice Chairman of the Rural Development and Migration Commission which was set up the state government on the vexed issue of migration from hills.According to an official estimate, nearly 1,500 villages out of the total 16,000 villages in the state have already been declared ghost meaning devoid of any inhabitant. "Though there are multiple reasons for migration, disasters are also one reason," said Negi.Negi and other top government officials admitted that there is no data available on the number of people migrating from hills in the wake of various calamities.Natural disasters are not just restricted to floods only in the hills. Calamities like earthquakes, forest fires and landslides take heavy toll in the state on regular intervals. In the two devastating earthquakes in the recent past - Uttarkashi-1991 and Chamoli-1999, hundreds of people were killed. In Kedarnath floods, over 5,000 people lost their lives while thousands of houses and vital infrastructure were also destroyed/damaged.Though the government has taken various steps to mitigate the suffering of the people due to disasters, environmentalists say they are not enough and call for banning hydel projects in the higher altitudes.Renowned enviromentalist Chandi Prasad Bhatt said he had written to the Centre in 2010 warning against the adverse effects of the hydel projects, including Rishiganga in the state. "Had my warning been taken seriously, such big devastations could have been avoided," he said.Sunderlal Bahuguna also kept issuing warnings on hydel projects saying these projects are adversely polluting Ganga river and triggering migration.

14-02-2021||New Delhi||Put Electricity Amendment Bill in public domain: Power engineers federation||The All India Power Engineers Federation (AIPEF) has demanded that the draft Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2021 must be put in the public domain before starting a discussion on the same.The AIPEF shot off a letter to the Prime Minister on Friday last week and pushed for placing the bill in public domain for stakeholders’ comments.The draft bill is not available on the power ministry website, AIPEF Spokesperson V K Gupta said in a statement.According to the statement, the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2021 is included in the list of 20 new bills to be placed in the current budget session of Parliament.The union power minister is to hold a video conference on February 17 with power secretaries of states and CMDs (chairman and managing directors) of discoms to discuss the proposed amendments to the Electricity Act 2003, it said.AIPEF Chairman Shailendra Dubey, in a letter to the union power minister, has said this is a short cut and rushing through amendments without due consideration or deliberations is not acceptable.There have been reports that the power ministry has circulated a draft Electricity Amendment Bill proposing changes to the Electricity Act, 2003.The proposed amendments entail de-licensing of the distribution business, among others.Gupta said the reports are unauthenticated and deserve to be discarded, particularly as the amendments would introduce a drastic policy of separating carriage and content which was earlier rejected by as many as 20 states.The outcome of the various suggestions of stakeholders on the Electricity Amendment Bill of 2020 remains undisclosed and a new draft bill has been leaked to a select few, the body said.The present approach of the Ministry of Power is non-transparent and secretive, and it seems the government is trying to hide critical facts, it added.AIPEF further said all the stakeholders, including associations/ unions of employees and engineers, consumers and others must be given sufficient time to present their viewpoints and the state governments are not the only stakeholders.

How can I cause heart pain? I apologise four times even if I bump into someone by mistake"."It can never be my intention to hurt someone's feelings through my jokes," he said.He said that the internet debates over worthless topics, abuses and hatred being spread there should stop."Why have we forgotten that the internet is for entertainment and information?" he asked."Shall we only keep on fighting on the internet?Anyone can fall prey to this herd mentality, politics. I did not fall prey to it. But I was bruised for something which I had not done," he said.Someone's politics and herd mentality can ruin a person's life, he added.An artist works hard to entertain people, the comedian said, adding that art and entertainment have always united the people."Some people are spreading hatred online. But why are we making them celebrities? You have to decide whether you want to spread love or hatred on the internet?"I can't give up comedy, I am alive because of it. I will win the hearts of the people who hate me. For this, I have to work harder. Every artist does not get this challenge.I have got it and will win their hearts," he added.Faruqui and four others were arrested on January 1 following a complaint by a BJP MLA's son that objectionable remarks about Hindu deities and Union Home Minister Amit Shah were passed during a comedy show at a cafe in Indore on New Year's Day. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/never-my-intention-to-hurt-anybody-through-my-jokes-comedian-212361

Contribution of the hero of Tawang cannot be forgotten. A due recognition has been given to Khathing, who was so far neglected,” Rijiju said.Khathing’s family members were also present at the function.Khathing, who was a Naga from Manipur, was given order by Daulatram to march towards Tawang with 200 soldiers of the Assam Rifles and 600 porters on January 17, 1951 from Chariduwar near Tezpur in Assam.Before World War II, Tawang was under administrative control of the then independent Tibetan government.Despite several attempts, the British could not annex it.According to the historical accounts of the NEFA, when Khathing and his men arrived in Tawang, he called a meeting on a high-ground near the Tawang Monastery for meeting local tax officials, village elders and prominent people of Tawang.Khathing used diplomatic skills to win over the locals.He soon realised that the local Monpa community was struggling under the harsh taxes imposed by the Tibetan administration.He told the local people about India, its democracy and assured them that India will never impose unjustified tax on them.Soon, with the Assam Rifles men, Khathing took control of Tawang, tricolour was hoisted in Tawang and Bumla and the area became part of India.

14-02-2021||New Delhi||AIMPLB moves SC opposing plea seeking uniform grounds of maintenance and alimony||The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has moved the Supreme Court against a plea seeking laying down of “gender and religion neutral” uniform grounds to award maintenance and alimony in matrimonial disputes as per international conventions and Constitution.The Board has opposed the plea filed by advocate and BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay which also seeks directions to the government to take appropriate steps to remove the prevailing anomalies in the grounds of maintenance and alimony, and make them uniform for all citizens without discrimination.“The applicant would like to submit that the expression and ‘Custom and Usage’ in Article 13 of the Constitution does not include faith of a religious denomination embedded in personal laws,” the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) plea said.“The constituent assembly was aware of the distinction between ‘personal law’ and the ‘Custom and Usage’ and chose advisedly to exclude personal law and include Custom and Usage in Article 13 of the Constitution,” it said while seeking impleadment in the petition filed by Upadhyay.The AIMPLB opposed Upadhyay’s plea on the basis that personal laws cannot be tested on the anvil of Articles 14, 15, 21 and 44 of the Constitution.The top court on December 16 last year had issued notice to the Centre on the plea filed by Upadhyay.Upadhyay’s petition, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, said that despite the eloquent provisions in the Constitution, the Central government has totally failed to provide even gender-neutral, religion-neutral uniform grounds of maintenance and alimony for all citizens.Maintenance and alimony is the only source of livelihood hence discrimination on the basis of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth is a direct attack on the right to life, liberty and dignity, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, it said.“Even after 73 years of Independence and 70 years of India becoming a socialist secular democratic republic, laws relating to maintenance and alimony are not only complex and cumbersome but also against the constitutional mandate of being equal, rational and just,” the plea said.“Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains are governed by the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 and the Hindu Adoption & Maintenance Act 1956. Muslims are dealt as per status of valid marriage & prenuptial agreement and governed under the Muslim Women Act 1986. Christians are governed under the Indian Divorce Act 1869 and Parsis under the Parsi Marriage & Divorce Act 1936, but none of these laws are gender neutral,” it said.The PIL stated that discriminatory maintenance and alimony reinforce patriarchal and stereotypical notions about women and thus any provision that perpetrates or reinforces discriminatory stereotypes against women is manifestly arbitrary.The plea has sought directions to declare that the discriminatory grounds of maintenance and alimony are violative of Articles 14, 15, 21 of the Constitution.It has also sought directions to the Law Commission to examine domestic and international laws and prepare a report on “uniform grounds of maintenance and alimony” within three months. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aimplb-moves-sc-opposing-plea-seeking-uniform-grounds-of-maintenance-and-alimony-212357
14-02-2021||New Delhi||Dinesh Trivedi 'allowed' to use floor of House for 'devious political ends': TMC to RS Chairman||The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Sunday alleged that Dinesh Trivedi, who resigned from the Rajya Sabha on Friday, took the "House for a ride" and was "allowed" to use the floor of the House for his "devious political ends"' Soon after Trivedi announced his resignation, the Trinamool Congress had lashed out at him and called him "ungrateful", while the BJP said he was welcome to join the saffron camp.Trivedi's resignation came amidst an exodus from the Mamata Banerjee's party ahead of the West Bengal assembly polls.Trivedi, a former railway minister, and two-time Lok Sabha MP, was sent to Rajya Sabha last year by the TMC after losing the parliamentary polls in 2019. He is reported to have had some issues with a senior Rajya Sabha member of the party for the past few months.In a letter to the Rajya Sabha Chairman, party's chief whip in the House Sukhendu Sekhar Ray said the TMC had recommended only two names as speakers for the discussion on the Union Budget 2021-22, but Trivedi was not among them.The TMC's allotted time on the discussion was exhausted after both the speakers spoke on their designated days, Ray said as he questioned why Trivedi was allowed to speak despite this."At about 1.25 pm on 12 February 2021, when the Hon'ble Finance Minister was about to give reply to the Budget discussion, one member of AITC, Sri Dinesh Trivedi, since resigned, was allowed to speak for about four minutes from 1.25 pm to 1.29 pm, although his name was not recommended by the AITC as speaker in the Budget discussion and no time was left for the party," he said in the letter which has been accessed by PTI.Trivedi, had said while resigning that he felt “suffocated” by the violence in West Bengal and his inability to do anything about it. He further said that Trivedi's seat was allotted in the Rajya Sabha Gallery, but he came down inside the Council Chamber and started to speak and “rambled” on his personal political motives “from a seat of his choice”  “The Chair did not take any action to stop such unauthorised intervention in Budget discussion, yet he spoke against the party he belonged to and made certain wild allegations against the AITC to substantiate his proposed resignation from the House," Ray charged. "The incident as narrated hereinabove and the manner in which Sri Trivedi grossly misutilised the floor of the House for his devious political ends and also the way he was allowed to have taken the House for a ride is absolutely unprecedented, unwarranted and is devoid of not only decorum and etiquette as envisaged in 'Rajya Sabha at Work', but also against all rules, norms and traditions of this august House," Ray said.It is a matter of great concern that although there were adequate mechanism under the rules to restrain the unruly member, it was not adopted, Ray charged. He also said that there is a specific rule to use for resigning from Rajya Sabha by a Member, but there doesn't exist any rule by which a Member is authorised to announce his resignation on the floor of the House. He said that the development that took place on February 12 was “absolutely beyond the scope of the rules, regulations, practices and traditions of this august House.” “I would urge upon you to immediately constitute an inquiry into the matter and to find out the reasons behind such unprecedented illegality committed through the deplorable action or inaction, as stated and/or any connivance or conspiracy that worked behind the scene to malign the AITC and for taking reasonable decisions at your end in the matter at the earliest,” he said.Trivedi is the fourth senior TMC leader to quit the ruling party in West Bengal in the last two months after Suvendu Adhikari and Rajib Banerjee, who had switched over to the BJP and Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who had expressed his desire to quit politics.This is not the first time that Trivedi had openly aired his grievances against the party. Earlier in March 2012, he had to step down as Railway Minister after Mamata Banerjee, who is also the TMC supremo, had opposed the railway budget placed by him.He was replaced with the then TMC general secretary Mukul Roy. Trivedi was also suspended from the party but was later reinstated.While resigning from the Rajya Sabha, he had said, "If you sit here quietly and cannot do anything, then it is better that you resign from here and go to the land of Bengal and be with people."What I mean to say is the way violence is taking place in our state. Sitting here, I am feeling perplexed as to what should I do," he had added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dinesh-trivedi-allowed-to-use-floor-of-house-for-devious-political-ends-tmc-to-rs-chairman-212350
14-02-2021||Sivasagar (Assam)||Congress will never implement CAA if voted to power in Assam: Rahul||Accusing the BJP and the RSS of “dividing” Assam, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said his party will protect every principle of the Assam Accord and will not let the Citizenship (Amendment) Act be implemented if voted to power in the upcoming assembly polls.Sounding the Congress’ poll bugle in the state, Gandhi attacked the Modi government repeatedly alleging that it was working with an approach of ‘Hum do, Hamare do’—a term he recently used while speaking in Lok Sabha to claim that the country is being run by only four people.At his first public rally in Assam ahead of the assembly elections due in the next few months, Gandhi along with all the senior leaders on the dais wore a ‘Gamocha’ (Assamese scarf) on which symbolically the word CAA was crossed out,  making it clear that Congress’ opposition to the controversial law will be a major poll plank.Gandhi hailed the contribution of former Assam Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Tarun Gogoi, who passed away recently, calling him Assam’s soldier who united the state and spent his entire life protecting it.In an apparent reference to former principal secretary to the Prime Minister Nripendra Misra being awarded the Padma Bhushan, the Congress leader, without naming anyone, said that in the same award list which had Tarun Gogoi, there was also the “name of a bureaucrat from PMO and I felt sad that the government of India had insulted Tarun Gogoi and this state”.“On one hand there is the person who dedicated his entire life for the people, united Assam and protected the flag of India, while on the other hand is the bureaucrat from PMO who only hailed the PM. Tarun Gogoi was my Guru, and I did not feel good about it,” Gandhi said.Stressing the importance of the Assam Accord, Gandhi said it was in a way the “protector” of Assam and the “tool of peace”.“I want to tell you that I, along with all Congress leaders, will protect and defend the principles of the Assam Accord. We will not back off even an inch from that,” he asserted.Gandhi said illegal immigration was an issue in Assam and exuded confidence that the people of the state have the capability to resolve the issue through dialogue.Alleging that the BJP and the RSS are trying to divide the state, he said, “If Assam is divided, then Prime Minister Narendra Modi or your Chief Minister (Sarbanand Sonowal) will not be affected, but the people of Assam and the rest of India will be harmed.”  Underlining the importance of the state, Gandhi said it was a beautiful flower in India’s bouquet.“Never forget that as much you need the country, the country needs you,” he said in his address to the gathering at the boarding field ground here.If there will be violence in Assam and it is divided, then India will be harmed along with the state, he said adding that, “we will not allow this to happen”.“We are wearing this ‘gamocha’ which has CAA written on it which is crossed out which means that no matter what happens, CAA will not be allowed (to be implemented by us)... listen ‘hum do humare do’, we will never allow CAA (to be implemented),” Gandhi said.“I have come here to tell you, all the Congress leaders are standing here that no power in the world can break Assam. The Congress and the people of Assam will teach a lesson to those who try to touch the Assam Accord and spread hatred,” he asserted.The Assam Accord provides for the detection and deportation of all illegal immigrants, who have entered the country after 1971 and living in the state, irrespective of their religion.Under the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 after facing religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants and will be given Indian citizenship.Anti-CAA protesters in the state say that the law violates the provisions of the Assam Accord.In his address, Gandhi said the state needs its “own chief minister” who will listen to the voice of the people and not the one “who listens only to Nagpur and Delhi”.“Remote control can operate a TV but it should not operate a state. The current CM listens to Nagpur and Delhi. If Assam gets a CM like this again, it will not benefit the people. The youths need a CM who will give jobs to them,” he said.Taking a dig at the Modi government and the state dispensation using an old family planning slogan, Gandhi alleged India is being run by four people—“Hum do, humare do’ baaki sab mar lo.”                  “For Assam, I have an extension, ‘hum do, humare do, aur humare do aur, jo Assam ko chala rahe hain. Aur Assam se sab kuch lo’, this is the reality,” he said.Gandhi alleged that natural resources and PSUs in the state were being “sold off” to two businessmen of the country.He also accused the Modi government of “looting” public money during the COVID-19 pandemic and waiving huge amounts of loans of his “businessmen friends”.During his address, Gandhi also held out Rs 167 and showed it to the people at the rally, to stress that the tea workers get only that amount, “while Gujarati business people get tea gardens”.“That is why they (the BJP) want to divide Assam because they know that if they have to steal from Assam then they have to divide the state,” he said.The Congress will add almost Rs 200 and give tea workers Rs 365 daily, he said.“Now you will ask where will the additional money come from, I will tell you—from Gujarati business people,” he said.Referring to the ongoing issue of the farmers protesting the three agriculture laws, he claimed that the prime minister gave a speech in Lok Sabha last week but did not say anything about farmers and there was also nothing for them in the budget.He alleged that demonetisation and GST destroyed the small and medium businesses which, he said, were the spine for employment generation.“Now they have got three farm bills through which they will destroy the whole agriculture system and India’s biggest business worth Rs 80 lakh crore, they are going to hand over to two people,” he alleged.The Congress is a party for the weak, poor, farmers, and small and medium business, Gandhi said.“We are a people’s party and wherever we come to power you will see two-three things—we will finish hate being spread, we will protect everyone and we will provide jobs,” he added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-will-never-implement-caa-if-voted-to-power-in-assam-rahul-212348

The scheme employs a three-pronged approach—combining efforts of the narcotics bureau, outreach and awareness by social justice and treatment through health department.A senior official said the NMBA will be further strengthened and continued under the National Action Plan for Drug Demand Reduction (NAPDDR), under which 13,000 youth volunteers in 272 districts will be trained as community mobilisers against drug abuse.He said around 11.80 lakh people would be benefited under the NAPDDR in the financial year 2021-22.Experts say to tackle the issue of substance abuse the government should be looking into long-term intensive treatment and rehabilitation.Loon Gangte, regional coordinator for South Asia at the International Treatment Preparedness Coalition, said employment opportunities must be provided after rehabilitation.“It needs to be ensured what happens after rehab rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is the easy path. After rehabilitation, about 80-90 per cent fall back into addiction so there needs to be a plan for it. The government should think beyond rehabilitation.

It also expressed concern over a few twitter handles proposing a repeat of the 1984 pogroms.Meanwhile, the Indian-American media has reported that Raj Sodhi-Layne, an unassuming long-time resident of California, was the driving spirit of a public campaign to fund an ad during the telecast of the Sunday Super Bowl that was watched by millions and went ‘viral’ on social media. Sodhi-Layne and her friends raised over $ 10,000 for the 30-second ad, she told Indica News.The following is the list of Indian diaspora organisations: Global Indian Progressive Alliance (GIPA); Hindus for Human Rights-USA (H4HR); Friends of India-Texas; The Humanism Project, Australia; Boston South Asian Coalition (BSAC); Voices Against Fascism in India (VAFI); Young India, Inc.; Kisan Pizza, UK; Coalition Against Fascism in India (CAFI); Students Against Hindutva Ideology (SAHI); International Solidarity for Academic Freedom in India (inSAF); Canadians Against Oppression & Persecution (COAP); Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC); Alliance to Save & Protect America from Infiltration by Religious Extremists (ASPAIRE); Coalition of Americans for Pluralism in India (CAPI); Ambedkar King Study Circle (AKSC); Dalit Solidarity Forum, US; Indian Solidarity Finland; Indian Solidarity Sweden; and Indo- Canadian Workers Association Canada.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/global-indian-diaspora-sends-roses-to-indian-missions-as-mark-of-love-to-farmers-212307

He was working on the post of havildar in the Indian Army and was posted at Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir. He had come home on leave a few weeks back and was set to return back soon.”His father Ashok Kumar Singh informed the police that Ashutosh left home on Friday night on some errand.Later that night, Ashutosh’s wife received a call on her mobile phone from a woman who informed her that Ashutosh was seriously injured and that his car was parked at a ground in Neem Sarai area.The family members soon rushed to the site and found him with severe injuries.The woman informed the victim’s kin that she was accompanying Ashutosh to check on a plot of land when they decided to buy momos but lost the way and ended up at Neem Sarai.Suddenly, they were interrupted by a few men who were blocking the road and this led to an argument with Ashutosh when he asked them to give way for the car to pass.The men attacked Ashutosh with bricks causing him serious injuries on the head.The SP said that on the complaint of the family members, an FIR has been registered against the woman who was accompanying Ashutosh and unidentified miscreants in connection with the crime.“We have detained the young woman named by the family members in the FIR. During questioning she first claimed that the unidentified miscreants also tried to rape her. However, she later changed her statement and claimed that she had been gang-raped. In the light of her conflicting statements, we are getting a medical examination of the woman conducted and have also sent her clothes for forensic examination,” he added.“The body of the victim has been sent for a post-mortem examination. Efforts are now on to identify and arrest the miscreants,” the police official said. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-man-killed-by-unidentified-men-in-uttar-pradesh-212300

With DGCA’s airfare band revision, domestic air travel would get costlier by 10 to 30 per cent, depending on the duration of the flight.Minister for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri today said, “We had 2,97,102 passengers on 2,349 flights on February 12, the highest since resumption of domestic flights on May 25, 2020. With air travel emerging as a preferred mode of travel due to safety and efficiency, we are almost touching pre-Covid numbers.”The Union minister’s remarks signaled a definite surge in demand for air travel. Taking a cue from the government, the DGCA has now announced a new price band beginning April 1.Airlines were adversely hit during Covid and reported massive losses in the last quarter. The rise in air fares, sector experts say, will help boost the finances of airline operators. As per the order, minimum fare on all seven sectors has been increased by 10-12 per cent and the limit on maximum fare has been raised by around 30 per cent. The seven sectors have been classified on the basis of approximate duration of flight.For instance, for flights with the duration of 90 to 120 minutes, the lower fare cap has been increased to Rs 3,900 from Rs 3,500, whereas the cap on maximum chargeable fare has been increased to Rs 13,000 from Rs 10,000. Routes like Varanasi-Jaipur, Ahmedabad-Kolkata, Bengaluru-Bhopal and Delhi-Bhubaneshwar among others fall under this category.Earlier, airfares on domestic routes were capped from May 25, 2020, with an intention to allow air services to resume without a massive drop or rise in prices. Domestic flights resumed after a two-month shutdown due to the Covid outbreak.As per the third-quarter results for the current financial year, SpiceJet reported a net loss of Rs 57 crore as against a profit of Rs 77.9 crore during the same period last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dgca-raises-fare-cap-air-travel-to-be-dearer-211991

In respect of all essential commodities, we should protect farmers' interests by mandating through statutory provisions that no farmer-trader transaction should be below MSP, wherever prescribed.”PM Modi, replying to the debate on the motion thanking the President's Address, had quoted former PMs Manmohan Singh and late Chaudhary Charan Singh to ask, “Why is the Opposition making U-turn on farm reforms today?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-questions-u-turn-on-msp-211994

He defended the abrogation of Article 370, saying it had enabled large-scale development and facilitated the extension of 170 laws, including the quota policy.Amit ShahOur government works on sentimentsArticle 370 abrogated for development... The Modi govt doesn’t work on laws and schemes. It works on sentiments. We believe J&K people are ours. “Nowhere does the current Bill say statehood will not be granted. The statehood will be given at the appropriate time,” Shah said after Opposition MPs Hasnain Masoodi (NC), Manish Tewari (Congress) and Asaduddin Owaisi (AIMIM) opposed the Bill and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury’s statutory resolution seeking its withdrawal was rejected by a voice vote.The minister attacked “three families that ruled J&K for 70 years” and asked, “Did these three families that ruled J&K for 70 years ever give an account of their work? We will give an account, but let these people look within and ask whether they have the right to ask others for accounts.” Listing a range of works undertaken in the UT after August 5, 2019, when Article 370 was scrapped, the government said it would defend the move in the apex court which had referred 15 petitions challenging the abrogation to a Constitutional Bench.Hasnain Masoodi, National Conference Abrogation of art 370 betrayal: NC’s MasoodiYou are continuously increasing confusion... What is the objective of this (J&K reorganisation) Bill? You are taking J&K towards uncertainty. The abrogation of Art 370 is a betrayal of pact the govt had with people.“Had the move been unconstitutional, the SC could have stayed it. But there is no stay. Should development be suspended till the matter is decided? Nowhere does the legal status say the move can’t be implemented,” Shah said after Masoodi called for halting the implementation of the move till the matter was sub judice.On Tewari’s suggestion that the government seek an early hearing in the SC, Shah said, “The Congress is not even before the SC. It has no position — yes or no. The hearing has been delayed because such a sensitive matter cannot be heard virtually.”On the post Article 370 phase in J&K, Home Minister quoted BR Ambedkar to say, “Kings will now be born in J&K from the ballot of voters and not from the wombs of queens.” The minister was referring to successful conduct of panchayat and district development council polls and said 21 subjects of governance, including mining, had been decentralised in J&K and Rs 1,500 crore provided for the works.The minister also rejected Congress’ allegations that 4G was restored under foreign pressure. On charges of human rights violations, Shah said, “These charges are relevant to times when three families ruled J&K. They never cared for the rights of West Pakistan refugees, Valmikis and Kashmiri Pandits because these people didn’t comprise their vote bank.”Shah invited sharp reactions after he said their government “worked on feelings, not laws”. “The Modi government does not work on laws. Modi government does not work on schemes and planning. It works on sentiments. We believe Jammu and Kashmir is ours. The people of J&K are ours. The whole country stands with Jammu and Kashmir. J&K will get statehood the moment development of the region, derailed by the “three-family rule”, is restored to an appropriate level,” Shah said.Congress MP Ravneet Bittu attacked Shah saying, “We knew all along that this government does what it feels right… it has no care for laws.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jk-statehood-at-appropriate-time-amit-shah-212031

Defending the Budget, Sitharaman said the Budget has set the pace for India to become “self-reliant” so as to become one of the top economies in the world.Responding to Gandhi’s speech on Thursday, during which he talked about the recent farm laws and not on the Budget proposals, she said: “It’s clear that their (Congress) belief in a democratically elected parliamentary system is finished.” She said she wanted Rahul to speak on 10 issues, but was disappointed.“I wanted to know from the Congress why it took a U-turn on the farm laws. But no reply came,” she remarked, even as she questioned the steps taken by the Congress-ruled Punjab Government to stop stubble-burning.“Rahul Gandhi did not refer to any clause in the three farm laws which, he claims, are against the farmers,” the Finance Minister pointed out. On the “Hum do, hamare do,” jibe, Sitharaman retorted: “The Modi government works for the common people, not for crony capitalists.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reform-push-to-make-nation-top-economy-nirmala-sitharaman-212032

There may be some spontaneous protests but in case of prolonged dissent or protest, there cannot be continued occupation of public places affecting the rights of others,” a three-judge Bench headed by Justice SK Kaul said.“We have considered the earlier judicial pronouncements and recorded our opinion that the Constitutional scheme comes with a right to protest and express dissent but with an obligation to have certain duties,” said the Bench, which also included Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Krishna Murari.Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the SC had on October 7 last year ruled that roads and public space couldn’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent had to be in designated places.However, review petitioner Kaniz Fatima and 11 other Shaheen Bagh protesters had requested the top court to reconsider its ruling, saying the judgment “appeared to be giving way to an unrestricted sanction to the police to take action by misusing these observations.”The protesters, who had blocked the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch in Delhi since December 15, 2019, were removed on March 24 after Covid lockdown was enforced.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/right-to-protest-cant-be-anytime-everywhere-supreme-court-212033

The rescuers are working on two strategies —drilling a hole vertically downward and also digging and excavating debris and sludge inside the tunnel. According to district officials, 166 persons are still missing while 38 bodies have been found.“As only 12 bodies have been identified so far, we have taken DNA samples of the remaining 26,” a senior administration official said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rescuers-boring-wider-hole-in-tapovan-tunnel-212036

14-02-2021||New Delhi||Farmer unions demand high-level judicial inquiry into January 26 violence||Protesting farmer unions on Saturday demanded a high-level judicial inquiry into the violence that took place during the tractor parade in Delhi on January 26 and the alleged ‘false” cases slapped on the farmers.Addressing a press conference at the Singhu border, Samyukta Kisan Morcha leaders asked farmers who are getting police notices not to appear before the force directly and, instead, approach the legal cell constituted by the unions for any assistance.Kuldeep Singh, a member of SKM’s legal cell, alleged that a retired judge of the Supreme Court or high court should probe the incidents to unravel the “conspiracy” behind the January 26 violence and the alleged “false cases” against the farmers.According to SKM leaders, 16 farmers who had participated in the tractor parade are still untraceable.Another leader Ravinder Singh said that 122 farmers had been arrested by Delhi Police in connection with 14 of the 44 FIRs, adding that SKM will provide legal and financial aid to all the arrested farmers.The Morcha leaders claimed that “false” cases were being slapped on farmers charging them with serious offences like dacoity and attempt to murder to “harass” them.Singh said that the Morcha will provide Rs 2,000 to every arrested farmer for spending in prison canteen.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points, demanding a repeal of the three agri laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmer-unions-demand-high-level-judicial-inquiry-into-january-26-violence-211940
14-02-2021|| Joshimath||Rescuers boring wider hole in tunnel; temporary lake on Rishi Ganga starts releasing water||A temporary lake formed at river Rishi Ganga has started discharging water, reducing the risk of another flash flood in the region, while rescuers on Saturday began boring a wider and deeper hole into the tunnel at the flood-ravaged Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project in an attempt to reach the over 30 people trapped inside for nearly a week. “The Silt Flushing Tunnel (SFT) was punctured on Friday night itself by drilling a 75mm-diameter hole into it but now it is being widened to 300 mm so that a camera and a water flushing pipe could be inserted into the tunnel where the trapped are possibly located,” General Manager of the NTPC project R P Ahirwal said The hole will have a depth of 12 metres, he said.Ahirwal said muck removal from the intake Adit tunnel, below which the SFT is located, has been done up to 136 metres.Rescuers said they were still hopeful of finding survivors, notwithstanding the numerous challenges like the muck and the water from Dhauli Ganga constantly flowing into the tunnels. The river had deviated from its path after the flash floods that have left 38 people dead and 166 missing.The State Emergency Operation Centre here said scientists of the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing during an aerial survey of the Rishi Ganga found that the glacial lake formed due to the avalanche over it has begun to release water, which reduces chances of it breaching or causing a fresh flash flood during the rescue operations.The lake is at the confluence of Raunthi Gad and Rishi Ganga.According to Central Water Commission (CWC) chairman Saumitra Haldar, it is 400 metres in length, 25 metres wide and 60 metres deep.The CWC is examining possibilities of what could be done if the water rises to a "critical" level. It is conducting simulation studies and also examining the possibility of carrying out a controlled blast to drain out the water."We are assessing what could be the impact if the water level rises following rains and snowfall as predicted by the IMD. We are also studying what volume of water would be released if the lake bursts and how much time it would take to reach downstream," Haldar told PTI.Ahirwal said making an approach road to the desilting basin from downstream and diverting the course of the Dhauli Ganga river from left to right are also in progress.PK Tiwari, Commandant of the National Disaster Response Force, said that based on their experience, they are optimistic about saving lives and mentioned the possible presence of air ducts and gaps in the tunnel.He said the situation had seemed irretrievable initially as the whole project had been damaged, but since then a lot of progress has been made and they will continue their efforts to reach the trapped people.When asked whether an attempt could also be made to send rescue personnel to the possible location of those trapped inside the tunnel through the hole, Ahirwal said it will need to be widened further for that and will be done if the need arises."More than 100 of our scientists are on the job. They are devising strategies and having them implemented," he said.He said all resources and mechanical equipment required for the operations are available at the project site.However, citing the conditions inside the tunnel, he said, "We can operate only with a few machines at a time. The rest of them have to be kept on standby because our strategy is to keep the operations underway round the clock". If for some reason equipment stops working, there are alternatives on standby to ensure that the operations do not stop, he said.He said many experienced workers of the project went missing in the calamity and those put on the job are new people. Still, they are working with total dedication.Talking about the biggest challenge being faced by the rescue team, the NTPC official said, "The rescue personnel are going to the tunnel where the men are likely to be trapped via HCC Adit where muck is constantly coming down from the NTPC barrage and its desilting basin to hamper the rescue efforts"."The water of Dhauli Ganga too is coming into our tunnels through the desilting basin as it has tilted to the left after the avalanche. Hence, restoring the flow of the Dhauli Ganga to the right is a big part of our strategy," Ahirwar said.The sludge choked contours and conduits of the barrage's desilting basin can also be removed more effectively only if the flow is restored to its earlier position.So far, 38 bodies have been recovered from the affected areas while 166 are still missing. DIG Nilesh Anand Bharne said 11 of the dead have been identified.Eighteen body parts had also been recovered from the flood-hit areas, of which 10 have been cremated after taking their DNA samples so far, he said.

I wish to remind you that Right of Privacy is a Fundamental Right, guaranteed to me, as a citizen of this country, under the Constitution of India, 1950,” Mitra wrote in her letter.“Upon making inquiries, I was informed that the armed officers from Police Station Barakhamba Road for my protection, however, I being an ordinary citizen of this country, did neither ask or want any such protection.

14-02-2021||New Delhi||J-K to get status of a state at appropriate time, Amit Shah says in Lok Sabha||The government on Saturday said the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir would be restored at an appropriate time and informed Parliament that 6,000 internally displaced Kashmiri Pandits would be rehabilitated in the Valley by 2022.Replying to a debate on the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Amendment Bill 2021 that allows officers of JK cadre to be merged with the AGMUT cadre, Home Minister Amit Shah said in Lok Sabha that the Bill had no association with the issue of JK’s statehood and statehood would be granted once the development of the UT was on track.The Bill was passed by a voice vote after the House rejected a statutory resolution Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury moved seeking withdrawal of the related ordinance, was rejected.Adhir also questioned the decline in Jammu and Kashmir’s economy after the August 2019 decision to abrogate Article 370 and questioned the Centre about the resettlement of Kashmiri Hindus.Home Minister Shah defended the abrogation of Article 370 saying the move had enabled the extension of 170 crucial central laws, including the anti-dowry legislation and the constitutional provisions of reservation to the UT of Jammu and Kashmir, besides fastening the pace of development works there.The home minister rejected NC member Hasnain Masoodi’s assertions that the Centre should stay the abrogation provisions since the apex court was seized of the petitions challenging the same.“The issue of constitutionality of Article 370 abrogation is pending in the Supreme Court . Had our move been so unconstitutional the SC could have stayed it. It is under consideration and not under stay. Nowhere does the legal status say it can’t be implemented and we should stop developmental works as some members have suggested,” said Shah adding that the government would defend its position when the time comes as one country could not have two flags and two constitutions.On Congress MP Manish Tewari’s suggestion that the government should move the SC with a plea for early hearing in the issue, Shah said the matter was too sensitive and elaborate for the courts to hear it virtually which was why the hearing had been delayed.“We are before the SC with a position that Article 370 should not have been there. The Congress is not even before the SC. It has no position — neither yes nor no,” said Shah.Quoting BR Ambedkar, the home minister said the abrogation of Article 370 had enabled the conduct of free and fair panchayat and district development council elections in JK and 22 subjects had been chosen to be handled at the level of panchayats and district councils including sand mining. This decentralisation, Shah said, would aid local development.“BR Ambedkar used to say real democracy would come the day kings are born from the ballot of voters and not from the wombs of queens. That’s what is happening in JK now,” said Shah adding that officers had been instructed to stay in villages, flag development gaps and plug them.He slammed AIMIM chief Asadudin Owaisi for mentioning the issue of “administrative postings in JK along religious lines” and asked, “Can’t a Hindu officer serve a Muslim and vice versa? Will we now divide officers on religion and call ourselves secular?”He termed Masoodi’s “80 per cent officers in Kashmir districts are outsiders” remark as “a comment made for cheap popularity” and said, “that’s the level of direct recruitment everywhere in India”.The minister also questioned Masoodi for referring to AGMUT cadre officers as outsiders to JK asking, “why should we treat Kashmir differently from states like Goa, is Kashmir not a part of India?”The Home Minister gave an account of development works done by Jammu and Kashmir administration in the 17 months post the abrogation of Article 370 and said: “Three families that ruled JK for 70 years never gave an account of their work. But they are asking us to give an account of 17 months. Let them look within and see if they have the locus to ask this question,” said Shah.Attacking the opposition for questioning the human rights record of BJP government in JK and accusing the Centre or restoring 4G under foreign pressure, Shah said, “Our government doesn’t work under pressure. Also this narrative of human rights violations is relevant to the 70-year rule of three families who had no care for the human rights of West Pakistan refugees, Valmikis, Kashmiri Pandits. Why? Because these people were not their vote banks,” Shah said accusing the opposition of weighing the issue of human rights from the prism of vote bank politics.Shah said out of 44,000 displaced Kashmiri Pandits, 6,000 would be resettled in the Valley by 2022.He also informed the house that the JK administration after scrapping the “Roshni Act which bred corruption” had created a land bank of over 29,000 kanal which would be utilised to facilitate investment in JK under a new industrial policy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/j-k-to-get-status-of-a-state-at-appropriate-time-amit-shah-says-in-lok-sabha-211910
14-02-2021||Satya Prakash||Right to protest cannot be anytime, everywhere: Supreme Court||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 13The Supreme Court has dismissed a petition seeking review of its Shaheen Bagh verdict that said roads and public spaces can’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations had to be in designated places alone.“The right to protest cannot be anytime and everywhere. There may be some spontaneous protests but in case of prolonged dissent or protest, there cannot be continued occupation of public places affecting the rights of others,” a three-judge Bench headed by Justice SK Kaul said.“We have considered the earlier judicial pronouncements and recorded our opinion that the Constitutional scheme comes with a right to protest and express dissent but with an obligation to have certain duties,” said the Bench which also included Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Krishna Murari.Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the Supreme Court had on October 7 last year ruled that roads and public spaces can’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.Deciding petitions seeking removal of protesters against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) from Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, the top court had said, “We have…no hesitation in concluding that such kind of occupation of public ways, whether at the site in question or anywhere else for protests is not acceptable and the administration ought to take action to keep the areas clear of encroachments or obstructions.”However, review petitioner Kaniz Fatima and 11 others Shaheen Bagh protesters had requested the top court to reconsider its ruling, saying the judgment “appears to be giving way to an unrestricted sanction to the police to take action by misusing these observations.”They had said, “Such observations may prove to be a license in the hands of the police to commit atrocities on legitimate voices of protest, especially the protesters coming from the vulnerable sections of the social strata. Again this aspect is an error of law apparent.”Notified on January 10, the CAA relaxed norms for grant of Indian citizenship by naturalisation to Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist and Jain and Parsi victims of religious persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who came to India before December 31, 2014. The top court had on January 22 refused to stay the operation of CAA and NPR.The protesters, who had blocked the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, including the Okhla underpass in Delhi since December 15, 2019, were removed only on March 24 after the COVID-19 lockdown was enforced. But the top court had chosen to keep the matter pending to clarify the legal position on the issue.The court had also faulted the authorities for not taking any decision, saying, “Unfortunately, despite a lapse of a considerable period of time, there was neither any negotiation nor any action by the administration, thus warranting our intervention.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/right-to-protest-cannot-be-anytime-everywhere-supreme-court-211900
