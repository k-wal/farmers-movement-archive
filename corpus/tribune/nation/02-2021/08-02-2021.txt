Gyawali said both the countries have common commitment to resolve the issue.“We have the common commitment to resolve it. The sanctity and security of the border is extremely important for expanding the overall developmental cooperation... We both have realised the urgency (to resolve the border issue),” he had said.Gyawali was the senior-most political leader from Nepal to visit India after relations nosedived following the boundary row. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-india-border-issue-should-be-resolved-through-serious-diplomatic-efforts-and-dialogue-oli-209642

08-02-2021||New Delhi||Punjab govt supporting 'gangster' Mukhtar Ansari, SC told||The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday unleashed a barrage of charges against the Punjab government for providing shelter to gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, who is accused in several heinous cases in Uttar Pradesh.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Supreme Court that Ansari is getting five-star treatment in a Punjab jail, and questioned why the state government was supporting a gangster. Mehta, representing the Uttar Pradesh government, did not mince words in criticising the Punjab government before a bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and R. Subhash Reddy."He (Ansari) is happy in Punjab jail and he is enjoying," Mehta said.The Solicitor General added that Ansari is being vociferously defended by the Punjab government. He said the Punjab government claims that he (Ansari) is suffering from depression, but in reality he is enjoying his time in jail. "The Punjab government is supporting a gangster. There are very serious cases pending against Ansari and the trials of the same are pending in Uttar Pradesh," Mehta contended before the top court. The Uttar Pradesh government has moved the top court seeking Ansari's transfer from Punjab to UP. However, the Ropar jail authorities have refused to hand him over citing medical grounds.Mehta added that summons were issued against Ansari, but then he got an FIR registered against himself in Punjab and did not even file for bail, rather he is enjoying his time in Punjab. The Uttar Pradesh government has termed the FIR as a complete sham and a design to help Ansari escape the law in Uttar Pradesh.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing Ansari, said that his client can appear through video conferencing in cases in Uttar Pradesh. Mehta rebutted that Ansari cannot choose a forum and he cannot sit in five-star accommodation and then appear for trial in Uttar Pradesh. Mehta told senior advocate Dushyant Dave, representing the Punjab government, "You are supporting Ansari." In an affidavit, the Uttar Pradesh government said that Ansari has been sheltered in Punjab for the past two years on the basis of two FIRs filed against him. "The respondent state of Punjab has made a mockery of the federal structure of the Constitution by seeking to defend an accused who is a gangster and a history sheeter," said the affidavit.The Uttar Pradesh government added that more than 30 FIRs and over 14 criminal trials, including for heinous crimes like murder, are pending against Ansari in various MP/MLA courts, where his personal appearance has been sought.Slamming the Punjab government, the Uttar Pradesh government said that its response is an attempt to gloss over and draw a veil over its true intent to not produce Ansari before a court in Uttar Pradesh. "The state of Punjab has not proceeded with the investigation of the FIR No. 5 of 2019 or filing of the chargesheet for two years even after arresting the accused on January 22, 2019, and lodging him in jail since January 24, 2019," said the UP government.Earlier, the top court had directed the Punjab government to file a detailed reply on the pending case against Ansari, including the status of trial along with a report on his medical condition.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-govt-supporting-gangster-mukhtar-ansari-sc-told-209623

In fact, all the preventive measures must be followed by all of us now and in the near future, as well. Considering this, it is praiseworthy that IRCS is continuing the distribution of masks from the prevention perspective,” he said.Transport drivers and helpers travel throughout the country and are vulnerable to the infection, he said, adding the masks being distributed by the IRCS will be of great help to them.Speaking on the COVID-19 situation, Vardhan said India has one of the highest recovery rates in the world.“Positive cases are also declining and stand at 1.48 lakh as of today. From one lab in January 2020, we now have 2,373 labs (for testing coronavirus). We have a capacity to conduct more than a million tests a day. We have completed 20 crore cumulative tests. This is a result of ‘whole of Government’ and ‘whole of Society’ approach,” he was quoted as saying in the statement.He further added that India has not only become self-reliant in production of masks, PPE kits, ventilators etc but is also in a position to export them now.On the ongoing vaccination drive in the country, he said more than 58 lakh beneficiaries have been vaccinated till now. On misinformation and rumours surrounding the vaccine, Vardhan said, “Many people are trying to spread misinformation and rumours related to vaccine. I appeal to the people to not believe in any such rumours.” —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/having-vaccine-does-not-mean-we-should-be-complacent-vardhan-209621

08-02-2021||Mumbai||Sunny Leone calls cheating charge 'slanderous' and 'deeply hurtful'||Sunny Leone has refuted cheating claims levelled against her, saying that half-baked information is as dangerous as misreporting.On her part, she has alleged lack of timely payment in the concerned deal.Last week, Sunny was questioned by Kerala Police at a private resort in Thiruvananthapuram. The interrogation was conducted following a complaint filed by an events manager in Kochi in an alleged cheating case.R. Shiyas, who conducts events in and around Kochi, had filed a complaint with the Kerala DGP alleging that Sunny had taken Rs 29 lakh from him while promising to attend various inaugural functions in the state but failed to do so. The case is related to a 2019 event.She has now accused the events organiser for sharing incorrect information, and hopes that law will take its course."Half information is as dangerous as misreporting.  And this is yet another case of the same. I want to set the record straight," Sunny said."As an artiste, work is worship for me. I was nothing but gracious, understanding even moving my schedule multiple times over the organisers. But they wouldn't commit to a set date. It is customary that to lock an actor's time, an advance has to be paid upfront, which wasn't done till the nth hour," she continued.There's absolutely no chance that if I have set a date and time for an event, I wouldn't show up," Sunny added."But due to a lack of timely payment from their end coupled with the fact that they dilly dallied on finalising the date, I bowed out. I have other commitments in Poovar. These are testing times and we have been shooting round the clock, putting ourselves at risk, to make sure the industry is back on its feet. Such slanderous claims and unethical behaviour on part of the event co-ordinators are deeply hurtful and unsolicited. I have already given the statement to the investigating officers and they are investigating the co-ordinators as well. Let law take its course," she further said.Sunny is currently in Thiruvananthapuram district, where she is shooting for the new season of "MTV Splitsvilla".According to a source, the event "was constantly getting rescheduled, eventually clashing with her other work engagements"."Moreover, the fees never paid in its entirety. Rs 12.50 lakh, which was to be paid seven days before the event as per the agreement, is yet to be cleared. She, however, has graciously agreed to attend the event if it matches her schedule,” claimed the source.The source also claimed that there were around five other celebrities who backed out from the event due to similar experience with the organisers, which is currently being investigated.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sunny-leone-calls-cheating-charge-slanderous-and-deeply-hurtful-209599

Kahin G-23 ke rai maan ke iss se ulta na kar de (Azad always uses polite language; he has even praised elections in Jammu and Kashmir.

He promised to examine the record and expunge anything that is found objectionable.Reddy, however, was not satisfied and continued to speak despite his mic being turned off and the Chair ordering that nothing would go on record.During this time, Reddy cast aspersions on the Chair.“You are saying the chairman is biased,” Naidu remarked.Later, Jairam Ramesh of the Congress said certain references were made at the Chair by the member.“They were highly objectionable references. I would request you to take note and take action,” Jairam Ramesh said.He was joined by other members who, too, demanded an action.Naidu said he felt “really sad today”. “Never has it happened (before),” he said.Explaining the procedure, he said if anything objectionable was said inside the House during a debate or discussion, the same could be brought to the notice of the chairman, who after examining it would expunge such remarks.“To my knowledge, nobody raised an objection or protested. Nothing was brought to my notice,” he said, referring to the objectional statement a few days back.Yet, the same could be brought to the notice of the chairman even later, he said, adding a notice could be given.“I would go through it and take appropriate action,” he said, adding: “But this sought of (remarks), in spite of the chairman saying this is not done, (the member continued to) continuously make allegations.”The idea, he said, was to make the chairman “dysfunctional”.Naidu went on to state that he had no problem if action was initiated for no-confidence in the Chairman according to the rules.“But I will not be cowed down by this sort of effort to make the chairman dysfunctional,” he said.He said he had resigned from the BJP before accepting the post.“Since then I have not been going to political programmes or attending such functions that were affiliated to a particular political party... because of this constitutional responsibility,” he said.“This,” he said, “is proper in my opinion and I have followed it till now.”“But suddenly if somebody says, ‘your body is here, the heart is there’... My heart is with the country, my heart is with the Constitution, my heart is with the people of India. I don’t worry about this, but as a human being, it pains,” he said. “I feel really sad,” Naidu added.

08-02-2021||Peshawar||Pak authorities, owners of ancestral houses of Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor urged to settle property rate||Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and the owners of the ancestral houses of legendary Bollywood actors Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor have been urged to reach a settlement over the rate fixed for the purchase of the two historic buildings for converting them into museums.Faisal Faroqui, a Peshawar-based spokesman for Dilip Kumar, told reporters here on Sunday that Peshawar lives in the heart of the Indian legendary actor and that he always discusses his association and sweet memories with his birthplace and the ancestral home in Mohallah Khudadad where he was born in 1922 before being shifted to India in 1935.The family and the fans of the Indian film legends were very enthusiastic over the provincial government’s decision to convert the two historic buildings into museums to honour the Bollywood legends and preserve their contribution to the Indian cinema, he said.Faroqui said that preserving the ancestral houses of the legendary actors will not only promote the importance of Peshawar but also strengthen Pakistan’s tourism industry.The provincial government early this month approved the release of Rs 2.35 crore to purchase the ancestral houses of the two legendary actors located in the heart of this city.The price of Dilip Kumar’s four marla (101 square metres) house has been fixed at Rs 80.56 lakh (USD 50,517) while that of Raj Kapoor’s six marla house (151.75 square metres) at Rs 1.50 crore (USD 94,061).After the procurement, both the houses will be converted into museums by the archaeology department of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.However, the owners of the ancestral houses have refused to sell the buildings at the rate fixed by the provincial government, saying the prime location property has been severely undervalued.The owner of Dilip Kumar’s ancestral house has demanded Rs 25 crore for the property.The owner, Haji Lal Muhammad, said he had purchased the property in 2005 for Rs 51 lakh after completing all formalities required for the transfer of the land and possesses all the documents of the house.He said it is unjust on part of the government to fix the rate at Rs 80.56 lakh for the property after 16 years.The owner of the ancestral house of Raj Kapoor demanded Rs 200 crore for the property in Peshawar. The government, however, has fixed the rate at Rs 1.50 crore.Raj Kapoor’s ancestral home, known as Kapoor Haveli, is situated in the fabled Qissa Khwani Bazar. It was built between 1918 and 1922 by the legendary actor’s grandfather Dewan Basheswarnath Kapoor.Raj Kapoor and his uncle Trilok Kapoor were born in the house. The building, which is in shambles, has been declared a national heritage by the provincial government.The owners of the two buildings have made several attempts in the past to demolish them for constructing commercial plazas in view of their prime location but all such moves were stopped as the archaeology department wanted to preserve them, keeping in view their historic importance.

Things in Orissa are stark. Farmers in the tribal areas have to resort to manual labour despite owning 10-12 acre of land. They don’t have money to even buy slippers,” Mahapatra said.“That visit to the tribal villages changed me. I returned home, bought a scooter and started visiting villages to mobilise farmers as there weren’t any active kisan unions in my state. I used to sleep in temples and schools. I was thrashed in Ganjam in 2013 as people took me for a child snatcher,” recalled Mahapatra, who is from Darentheng village near Bhubaneswar.The same scooter is now being used as a prop for a whiteboard for a makeshift school in many of the tribal areas.“Now, we have volunteers who have taken over, and we are active in over 40 villages. We also run an orphanage for around 30 children,” said Mahapatra, who is also the state president of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh.In his own words, he has been jailed at least seven times and has been targeted by goons on a number of occasions.“I don’t know how many times I have been injured. My parents and relatives were worried and wanted me to get a job. But now, they are supportive,” Mahapatra said.Mahapatra has been active in the farmers’ protests as well and was invited to address the crowd at Ghazipur.“I spent a lot of time at Singhu and Tikri borders but had to go back on December 26. I was part of two meetings with the government as well. We also took out our own rally in Odisha in solidarity,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhubaneswar-mba-graduate-leaves-high-paying-job-to-mobilise-odisha-farmers-209559

In addition, the volunteers have been asked to note down details, including the names of their villages and whether they have come at the behest of their local district presidents of the kisan unions.The measures are being taken after Bhartiya Kisan Union national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait called to weed out right-wing elements who have been staying at the protest site in the garb of farmers.“We will identify those who are staying here as farmers. They will be found and asked to leave soon,” Tikait had said on Saturday. “Un sab ka ilaj hoga (They will be taught a lesson),” he added.As per Jagtar Singh Bajwa, member, Kisan Andolan Committee, these checks will be a huge deterrent to those who have begun to take the protest site as a picnic spot.“It is a message to one and all that this is a protest site and only people with genuine intentions will be allowed to stay here,” Bajwa said, adding: “Today was the first day and already, our volunteers have found a few who have no business to be here,” he added.The team led by BKU’s Uttar Pradesh youth president Digambar Singh started the drive early on Sunday.“We have started to ask for Aadhaar cards from those who are staying at the Ghazipur protest site,” a volunteer said.“We take the information and check with their local contacts, including aila pramukhs to try and find out whether they have genuine business being here or not,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-weed-out-right-wingers-volunteers-screen-farmers-living-in-ghazipur-tents-209557

The case was later transferred to Bengaluru.While the trial court in Bengaluru convicted all four, the Karnataka High Court later acquitted them.The Supreme Court, allowing appeals challenging their acquittals, confirmed and restored the trial court order convicting Sasikala, Illavarasi and Sudhakaran, while abating appeals related to Jayalalithaa in view of her death in December 2016.

08-02-2021||United Nations||UN ready to contribute to ongoing rescue efforts in Uttarakhand: Guterres||The United Nations stands ready to contribute to the ongoing rescue and assistance efforts in Uttarakhand, if necessary, Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said as the top leadership of the global organisation expressed sadness over the loss of life and damage from the glacier burst and flooding in the Indian state.A portion of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district on Sunday, triggering an avalanche and a deluge in the Alaknanda river system that washed away hydroelectric stations, leaving at least seven people dead and 125 missing who are feared dead.The sudden flood in the middle of the day in the Dhauli Ganga, Rishi Ganga and Alaknanda rivers -- all intricately linked tributaries of the Ganga -- triggered widespread panic and large-scale devastation in the high mountain areas.Commenting on the glacier burst, Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Guterres, said: “The Secretary-General is deeply saddened by the reported loss of life and dozens missing following the glacier burst and subsequent flooding in Uttarakhand state, India, on Sunday”.“The Secretary-General expresses his deep condolences to the families of the victims and to the people and Government of India. The United Nations stands ready to contribute to ongoing rescue and assistance efforts, if necessary,” he said in a statement.Responding to the statement by Guterres, India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti said: “Deeply appreciate the sentiments expressed by UN Secretary General” on the glacier burst in Uttarakhand.Earlier in the day, President of the UN General Assembly Volkan Bozkir said that he is closely following the situation in Uttarakhand.“I'm closely following the news out of #Uttarakhand, #India, where the breaking of a glacier has led to at least 9 dead & 140 missing. As rescue efforts continue, my thoughts are with @IndiaUNNewYork and the Indian people,” Bozkir said in a tweet that tagged India's Permanent Mission to the UN.In response to Bozkir's tweet, Tirumurti expressed gratitude, saying “we deeply appreciate your sentiments. Thank you.”Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has said that seven bodies have been recovered while at least 125 people are missing.The glacier burst led to a rise in water levels in the Rishiganga river, which washed away the Rishiganga small hydroproject of 13.2 MW.The flash flood also affected the downstream hydro project of NTPC at Tapovan on the Dhauli Ganga river, which is a tributary of the Alaknanda.

08-02-2021||New Delhi||With no rain or melting of snow, floods in Chamoli peculiar: Experts||Two teams of glaciologists will head to Joshimath-Tapovan on Monday to study the causes of massive flood caused after a part of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district, the director of the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology said.Kalachand Sain said two teams of glaciologists -one with two members and other with three members -will leave Dehradun on Monday morning.The Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehradun, under the aegis of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), studies various aspects of the Himalayas, including the glaciers and seismic activities in the region.It had also conducted studies on the 2013 flash floods in Uttarakhand that killed nearly 5,000 people."The teams will study the reasons behind the incident. Our teams will be looking into different aspects of glaciology," Sain said, adding that it is too early to comment on the development.A portion of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Uttarakhand's Chamoli district on Sunday, triggering an avalanche and a deluge in the Alaknanda river system that washed away hydroelectric stations, leaving at least seven people dead and 125 missing who are feared dead.Sain added that the Sunday's incident was quite "peculiar" as there was no rain or melting of snow.The glacier burst led to a massive flood in the Dhauli Ganga river and caused large-scale devastation in the upper reaches of the ecologically fragile Himalayas.

08-02-2021||---||Uttarakhand glacier bursts, 10 killed in flashflood, over 125 missing||New Delhi/Dehradun, Feb 7Ten persons were killed and over 125 went missing after a portion of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district today, triggering an avalanche and a deluge in the Alaknanda river system that swept away a hydropower project and ravaged several villages downstream.The flashflood occurred around 11.20 am in the Dhauli Ganga, Rishi Ganga and Alaknanda rivers — all intricately linked tributaries of the Ganga — leading to widespread panic and large-scale devastation in the area.Read also:How it happenedTwo power plants —NTPC’s Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project and the Rishi Ganga hydel project — were extensively damaged with scores of labourers trapped in tunnels as the water came gushing in.Sixteen men were rescued from a tunnel in the Tapovan project, but over 125 were missing, said officials. Five NDRF teams, 250 ITBP and 600 Army personnel were at the site to aid rescue operations, the officials said.Rishi ganga project washed awayA 13.2 MW hydro project on the Rishi Ganga river was swept away but there is no danger of floods in downstream areas as the water level has been contained.Water level in the lower areas of Chamoli along the river was reported to be rising again and people near the river bank were being alerted, the state police said late at night after the river waters appeared to be receding earlier in the day.Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Rawat said at 6 pm that seven bodies had been recovered and a majority of those missing were workers employed at the two projects.Three more bodies were recovered later. The 13-MW Rishi Ganga project, which was washed away, was commissioned in 2020 while the other project, 5 km downstream at Tapovan, was under construction.“Around 35 persons were working at the Rishi Ganga project. Two policemen are also missing. A large number of labourers working at the other project are untraceable,” the CM said, adding that food packets were being air dropped in 13 villages that had been cut off. Five NDRF teams are at the site to execute rescue operations through the night. This is the second flashflood caused by a glacial breach in Uttarakhand after the 2013 Kedarnath deluge.Study had warned of melting glaciersA 2019 study had warned that climate change was affecting Himalayan glaciers that were melting twice as fast since the start of this century.Homes along the way were also swept away as the waters rushed down the mountainsides in a raging torrent. There was no danger of floods in downstream areas as the water level had been contained, the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC), headed by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, was informed at an emergency meeting in the National Capital. The connectivity with some border posts was “totally restricted” due to a bridge collapsing near Reni village, close to the project site, an ITBP spokesperson said.Several districts, including Pauri, Tehri, Rudraprayag, Haridwar and Dehradun, were put on high alert and ITBP and the NDRF personnel were rushed in to help with the rescue effort. The personnel were seen rappelling down steep mountainsides to aid in the rescue work.Bharti: Had opposed projects on ganga“As minister, I was against power projects on the Ganga & its main tributaries,” BJP leader Uma Bharti claimed.PM Modi has announced an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each for the next of those dead. The injured will get Rs 50,000 each. The Army has sent in various teams for the rescue operation. Two Air Force helicopters were also pressed into service to ferry NDRF teams and relief material to Uttarakhand. Navy divers had been kept on standby while the DRDO would be sending a team to study any further glacial threat, said officials.

08-02-2021||Mumbai||Finance Minister rejects ‘selling family silver’ charge||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday rejected the Opposition’s charge of “selling family assets” through the Budget stress on privatisation, terming it a “lazy allegation”.All previous governments had done disinvestment in the past, and the Narendra Modi regime had formulated a clear policy on which companies to be divested and the strategic sectors that not to be touched rather than doing one company sell-off at a time, she said in an address to business honchos here.The Budget proposals to divest stakes, which includes the sale of two public sector banks and a general insurer, have been panned by the Opposition. “It is not what the Opposition says about selling family silver, it’s not at all,” she said.“Family silver should be strengthened, it should be our ‘takat’ (strength)... because you’ve spread it so thinly, there are many of them (PSUs) that are not able to survive and the few that can perform do not get due attention. Our aim is to prime them through this policy. You need them, you need them to scale up so that they meet the aspirations of growing India,” she said.She said the idea was to ensure that there were a few state-run companies that achieved scale to deliver on the aspirations of a country like ours.For many years, taxpayer money has been spent on recapitalising inefficient state-run companies and it is the government’s intent to ensure that the available resources are spent in the best possible manner, which can be done only by reducing the number of such enterprises, she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/finance-minister-rejects-selling-family-silver-charge-209427

He slammed the reigns of the Congress, Left and the TMC for “signature corruption and lack of growth.”“In 2011 people trusted Mamata when she promised change. Mamta ki apeksha thi, nirmamta ke shikaar ho gaye (people sought empathy but got cruelty). In the very first year of her government, it was clear that Bengal had not changed but seen a rebirth of the Left rule along with interest,” said a combative PM accusing the TMC government of “institutionalising corruption, criminalising politics and politicising administration and the police.”The PM said the days of TMC’s “extortion syndicate” were numbered as the people had decided to bid adieu to Didi.Accusing Mamata of blocking a range of central benefits to the people of the state – from disbursement of cash to 25 lakh farmers under PM Kisan Samman Nidhi and Ayushman Bharat’s Rs 5 lakh free hospitalisation cover annually for poor families to the National Education Policy and the provisions of the seventh Central Pay Commission – the PM said genuine Trinamool leaders who were fed up with the “dynastic politics of Mamata had joined the BJP to chant “Jai Shri Ram.”The PM questioned the CM for silence on the “ongoing international conspiracy to defame India” and said, “These days a global conspiracy is unfolding to malign India. Have you ever seen Didi utter a word against that? Even those who ruled India for decades are backing the conspirators. But India will give a befitting reply to them,” the PM said amid global celebrities tweeting in favour of farmers’ protests.Wants institutes to teach in mother tongue||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/didi-promised-change-but-promoted-only-corruption-modi-209371

At present, the Ministry of Earth Sciences can make predictions 24 hours before such events but that’s not enough to mitigate the impact of disasters like flashfloods caused by glacial breaks, cloudbursts and heavy rain.Government sources said a plan was afoot to develop multi-hazard early warning system for disaster-risk management for “impact-based early warnings of natural disasters through the establishment of a Decision Support System (DSS) based on multiple meteorological disasters namely, tropical cyclones, heavy rainfall, urban floods, fog, air pollution emergencies, heat and cold waves, thunderstorms, lightning, windstorms and flashfloods”. Claims apart, advanced warnings were not in place even in 2013 when a glacial break caused a hydro- metrological disaster in the Mandakini valley of Uttarakhand’s Rudraprayag district in June, 2013. A report that documented the Kedarnath floods said, “Despite claims of advance warning regarding the Kedarnath incident having been communicated to the state government, what was communicated was nothing better than a general forecast predicting heavy rain.”Technology upgrade need of the hourAt present, the Ministry of Earth Sciences can make predictions 24 hours before such events, but that’s not enough to mitigate the impact of disasters like flashfloods caused by glacial breaks, cloudbursts and heavy rain.How glacial lakes are formedGlacial lakes are formed when glaciers retreating on account of climate change leave behind huge ice deposits. This ice creates lakes when it melts.

Drone technology is being effectively used for not only smuggling activities but also for surveillance purposes, jamming and bringing down a ‘swarm’ of low flying drones is the latest challenge in warfare.A study by industry body FICCI assessed India’s drone and counter-drone market potential up to around Rs 3,00,000 crore (approx US$40 billion) by 2030. Defence and Homeland Security could account for 50 per cent of it.The counter drone technology is of various type. “Many anti-drone systems have also been approved by the Ministry of Home Affairs and we are in the process of finalising the equipment suited to our requirements,” said SK Asthana the Director General of BSF.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drone-threat-looms-india-aims-to-create-40-bn-industry-209287

There is a second tunnel too where the rescuers are working,” Pandey said.Chamoli, about 270 km from state capital Dehradun, is a border district along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China and it is well known for the Badrinath shrine that is located very close to the last Indian village in Mana.The ITBP has a large deployment here as part of its mandate to guard the LAC. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nayi-zindagi-mili-itbp-rescues-workers-stuck-in-flash-flood-hit-tunnel-209206
08-02-2021||New Delhi||Uttarakhand flood: 2019 study warned Himalayan glaciers melting at alarming speed||As a part of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district on Sunday, leading to massive floods, a study published in 2019 had warned that Himalayan glaciers have been melting twice as fast since the start of this century due to climate change.The glacier collapse at Joshimath on Sunday led to a massive flood in the Dhauli Ganga river and caused large-scale devastation in the upper reaches of the ecologically fragile Himalayas.The 2019 study, spanning 40 years of satellite observations across India, China, Nepal and Bhutan, indicates that climate change is eating the Himalayas’ glaciers, the researchers said.The study, published in the journal Science Advances in June 2019, shows that glaciers have been losing the equivalent of more than a vertical foot and half of ice each year since 2000 -- double the amount of melting that took place from 1975 to 2000.“This is the clearest picture yet of how fast Himalayan glaciers are melting over this time interval, and why,” said Joshua Maurer, a PhD candidate at Columbia University in the US.While not specifically calculated in the study, the glaciers may have lost as much as a quarter of their enormous mass over the last four decades, said Maurer, lead author of the study.The study synthesised data from across the region, stretching from early satellite observations to the present.The data indicates that the melting is consistent in time and space, and that rising temperatures are to blame, the researchers said.Temperatures vary from place to place, but from 2000 to 2016 they have averaged one degree Celsius higher than those from 1975 to 2000, they said.Researchers analysed repeat satellite images of some 650 glaciers spanning 2,000 kilometres from west to east.Many of the 20th-century observations came from declassified photographic images taken by the US spy satellites.They created an automated system to turn these into three dimensional (3D) models that could show the changing elevations of glaciers over time.The researchers then compared these images with post-2000 optical data from more sophisticated satellites, which more directly convey elevation changes.They found that from 1975 to 2000, glaciers across the region lost an average of about 0.25 metres of ice each year in the face of slight warming.Following a more pronounced warming trend starting in the 1990s, starting in 2000 the loss accelerated to about half a metre annually.Researchers noted that Asian nations are burning ever-greater loads of fossil fuels and biomass, sending soot into the sky, adding much of it eventually lands on snowy glacier surfaces, where it absorbs solar energy and hastens melting.They compiled temperature data during the study period from ground stations and then calculated the amount of melting that observed temperature increases would be expected to produce.The team then compared those figures with what actually happened.“It looks just like what we would expect if warming were the dominant driver of ice loss,” Maurer said.The Himalayas are generally not melting as fast as the Alps, but the general progression is similar, the researchers said.The study did not include the huge adjoining ranges of high-mountain Asia such as the Pamir, Hindu Kush or Tian Shan, but other studies suggest similar melting is underway there as well.The researchers noted that some 800 million people depend in part on seasonal runoff from Himalayan glaciers for irrigation, hydropower and drinking water.The accelerated melting appears so far to be swelling runoff during warm seasons, but scientists project that this will taper off within decades as the glaciers lose mass.This, the researchers said, will eventually lead to water shortages.The study shows that “even glaciers in the highest mountains of the world are responding to global air temperature increases driven by the combustion of fossil fuels,” said Joseph Shea, a glacial geographer at the University of Northern British Columbia in Canada, who was not involved in the study.“In the long term, this will lead to changes in the timing and magnitude of streamflow in a heavily populated region,” said Shea. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-flood-2019-study-warned-himalayan-glaciers-melting-at-alarming-speed-209153

Kindly interfere in the matter and issue guidelines to the state for violating the human rights,” the letter from advocates Vasu Kukreja, Ravneet Kaur and Jaswanthi Anbuselvam reads.The five-page plea points out two judgements — DK Basu vs State of West Bengal (1997) in the Supreme Court that laid out guidelines and rights of arrested persons, and a Kerala High Court decision in the Faheema Shirin vs State of Kerala case that declared “the use of internet as basic human right” to support their claim.“We have approached the India head of the UNHRC seeking their intervention of gross violation of basic rights by the police,” Kukreja told The Tribune, adding: “And we have mentioned a few cases supporting our plea.”“The UN has intervened many times in such matters. So we are hoping that they do the same for the farmers as well,” he said.Nametags and clear identification of interrogation officers, memo of arrests, information to family members of those arrested, diary entry of those arrested, full check-up of the held for minor or major injuries, are some of the other demands made by the legal cell.The letter adds: “That, since the initiation of the protest, the farmers are getting arrested by the police from the protest site unreasonably and inappropriately in an arbitrary and barbaric nature by the police officials.”“That your lordship, the Government has suspended the internet services in the protest sites which has been declared a human right by the united nations and have blocked the access of information ‘to and fro’ the protesting farmers and have denied issuing many other basic rights, disrupting even the survival of the farmers in the protest sites,” the letter further reads.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmer-unions-write-to-india-head-of-unhrc-seek-intervention-in-farmers-arrest-209141

08-02-2021||Dehradun/New Delhi||Floods as glacier breaks off in Uttarakhand, 16 labourers rescued, 7 bodies found but 125 still missing||A portion of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district on Sunday, triggering an avalanche and a deluge in the Alaknanda river system that washed away hydroelectric stations and trapped more than 100 labourers who are feared dead.The sudden flood in the middle of the day in the Dhauli Ganga, Rishi Ganga and Alaknanda rivers—all intricately linked tributaries of the Ganga—triggered widespread panic and large-scale devastation in the high mountain areas.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved an ex gratia of Rs 2 lakh each for the next of kin of those who lost their lives, the Prime Minister's Office said on Sunday.The PMO also said Rs 50,000 would be given to those seriously injured.Two power projects – NTPC’s Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project and the Rishi Ganga Hydel Project – were extensively damaged with scores of labourers trapped in tunnels as the waters came rushing in.Sixteen men were rescued safely from a tunnel in the Tapovan project but about 125 were still missing. As night fell in the ecologically fragile Himalayas and rescue work in the difficult to access areas became more difficult, there were fears they may be dead.Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said seven bodies were recovered and at least 125 were missing.Homes along the way were also swept away as the waters rushed down the mountainsides in a raging torrent. There were fears of damage in human settlements downstream, including in heavily populated areas. Many villages were evacuated and people taken to safer areas.By evening, it became clear that downstream areas were safe.A 13.2 MW small hydro project on the Rishi Ganga was swept away in the glacier burst but there was no danger of floods in downstream areas as the water level had been contained, the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC), headed by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, was informed at an emergency meeting in the national capital.The NCMC was also told that people trapped in project tunnel were rescued by the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) while efforts were on to rescue those trapped in another tunnel. The operation was coordinated by the Army and the ITBP, an official spokesperson said.The flood also affected the downstream hydro project of NTPC at Tapovan on the river Dhauli Ganga, the spokesperson said.There is also no threat to neighbouring villages, according to information given by the Central Water Commission (CWC).Connectivity with some border posts was “totally restricted” due to a bridge collapsing near Reni village, close to the project site, an ITBP spokesperson said.The border guarding force has units based in Joshimath,a short distance away, and managed to reach the spot within an hour of the first alert at about 10.45 am.Several districts, including Pauri, Tehri, Rudraprayag, Haridwar and Dehradun, were put on high alert and forces of the ITBP and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) rushed in to help with the rescue and relief effort. The personnel were seen rappelling down steep mountainsides to aid in the rescue work.Groups of people were seen sitting along the high altitude roads, waiting for news of their loved ones.As details of the disaster came in, President Ram Nath Kovind said he was deeply worried about the massive glacier burst at Joshimath, 295 km from Dehradun.“Praying for wellbeing and safety of people. Am confident that rescue and relief operations on ground are progressing well,” he tweeted.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was constantly monitoring the situation in the state.“India stands with Uttarakhand, prays for everyone’s safety,” he said.Addressing a rally in West Bengal later in the day, he assured all help in fighting the calamity and said he was in constant touch with the Uttarakhand chief minister and Home Minister Amit Shah on the rescue and relief efforts being carried out.Shah also spoke to Rawat and assured him of all possible support to deal with the situation arising from the glacier burst and the resulting floods.Also read:Himalayan glaciers melting twice as fast, 2019 study foundGlacier burst: IMD says no adverse weather over affected areas on February 7-8‘Uttarakhand, we are with you’: Bollywood celebs wish for people's safety High alert in UP as glacier breaks off in neighbouring UttarakhandA Home Ministry spokesperson said four NDRF teams (about 200 personnel) were airlifted to Dehradun and would head to Joshimath. One column of the Engineering Task Force (ETF) of the Army, with all rescue equipment, has been deployed.The chief minister also appealed to people to not spread rumours through old flood videos.Besides, NTPC managing director was asked to reach the affected site immediately.Two teams of the NDRF were sent and three additional teams flown in from Hindon airport in Ghaziabad. The troops are expected to reach the affected region tonight.Indian Navy divers are also being flown in and aircraft and helicopters of the Indian Air Force (IAF) are on standby, the spokesperson said.In some good news, the India Meteorological Department informed that there is no rainfall warning in the region for the next two days.News that about 150 labourers were affected had come in the early in the day.“Representatives of the power project have told me that they are not being able to contact around 150 of their workmen at the project site,” said State Disaster Response Force DIG Ridhim Aggarwal. The waters in the Dhauli Ganga was flowing two to three metres above normal, the official added.

08-02-2021||New York||New York Assembly passes Kashmir resolution; India calls out attempts to misrepresent J-K’s rich mosaic||The New York State Assembly has passed a resolution calling on Governor Andrew Cuomo to declare February 5 as Kashmir American Day, drawing a sharp reaction from India which noted with “concern” attempts by “vested interests” to misrepresent Jammu and Kashmir’s rich cultural and social mosaic to divide the people.The resolution, sponsored by Assembly member Nader Sayegh and 12 other lawmakers, states that the “Kashmiri community has overcome adversity, shown perseverance and established themselves as one of the pillars of the New York immigrant communities”.It adds that “the State of New York endeavours to champion human rights, including the freedom of religion, movement and expression for all Kashmiri people, which are embedded within the US Constitution, through the recognition of diverse cultural, ethnic and religious identities”.Commenting on the resolution, a spokesperson of India’s Embassy in Washington said: “We have seen the New York Assembly Resolution regarding Kashmir American Day. Like the US, India is a vibrant democracy and the pluralistic ethos of 1.35 billion people are a matter of pride”.“India celebrates its diversity and rich cultural mosaic, including in Jammu and Kashmir, which is an integral and inalienable part of India. We note with concern the attempt by vested interests to misrepresent the rich cultural and social mosaic of Jammu and Kashmir to divide the people. We will engage with the elected representatives in the New York State on all matters concerning India-US partnership and the diverse Indian Diaspora,” the spokesperson said on Saturday in response to queries on the resolution.The legislative resolution, adopted in the New York State Assembly on February 3, calls on Cuomo to proclaim February 5, 2021, as Kashmir American Day in the State of New York.In a tweet, Pakistan’s Consulate General in New York acknowledged the role of Sayegh and The American Pakistani Advocacy Group towards the adoption of the resolution.Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5, 2019, and bifurcating it into two union territories — Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.India has firmly told Pakistan that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir has been, is, and shall continue to be an integral part of India. New Delhi has maintained that issues related to Jammu and Kashmir are internal matters to India.India has categorically told the international community that the scrapping of Article 370 of the Constitution was its internal matter. It also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.

08-02-2021||Dhekiajuli (Assam)||I want one medical college, tech institute in each state to teach in mother tongue: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday pitched for setting up at least one medical college and a technical institution in each state that will impart education in the native language.He was addressing a gathering after launching ‘Assam Mala’ scheme to upgrade state highways and laying the foundation for two medical colleges.“There is no dearth of talent in the villages and far-flung areas. I have a daring dream of each state having at least one medical college and a technical institution imparting education in the local language,” he said, promising setting up such institutions in Assam after the assembly elections.He said this would improve medical services in remote areas as more and more doctors would be able to reach out to people in their mother tongue and understand their problems.The two medical college and hospitals will come up in Biswanath and Charaideo districts.In India, teaching and learning have largely been in a foreign language but that could change with the advent of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.“Taking inspiration from the National Education Policy, it will now be tried to teach all technical courses including medical, engineering in mother tongue,” Modi had tweeted after the unveiling of the NEP.Meanwhile, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is unlikely to attend Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s scheduled programme at Haldia in Purba Medinipore district on Sunday evening, a top official at the state secretariat has said.The exact reason for this uncertainty has not been specified but the “insult meted out to her” on January 23, when Jai Shri Ram’ slogans were raised at an event just before her speech, could be the cause, he said.Modi is set to inaugurate four projects in Haldia in oil, gas, and infrastructure sectors.“Madam (CM) is unlikely to attend this evening’s programme at Haldia where PM Modi will be inaugurating projects,” the official told PTI.The TMC boss has also asked her party members to skip the programme, he added.Banerjee had on January 23 refused to deliver her speech at an event on the occasion of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s 125th birth anniversary, after a section of the audience raised ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans in the presence of the Prime Minister.She had said such “insult was unacceptable”.Sources in the Raj Bhavan said Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar is scheduled to attend Sunday’s event.
