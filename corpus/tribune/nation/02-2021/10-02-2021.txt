10-02-2021||Bhubaneswar||Puri temple to remain open throughout the week||Lord Jagannaths temple in Puri will remain open throughout the week, including Sundays, and the devotees can eat 'mahaprasad' (holy food) at auspicious Anand Bazaar.This was announced by Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA) chief administrator Krishan Kumar after a review of the standard operating procedure (SOP) implemented following reopening of the 12th century shrine for the general public last month."Keeping in view the experience of the last 20 days and the feedback, now it has been decided to open the temple on Sundays also."Earlier, the shrine was kept closed on Sundays for sanitisation purposes," Kumar told reporters.He said the devotees could witness the trinity (Lord Balabhadra, Devi Subhadra and Lord Jagannath) Padma Bhesa (Lotus attire) on February 14, which falls on coming Sunday.This apart, Kumar said the devotees would now also be allowed to partake ‘mahaprasad’ in Anand Bazaar.Anand Bazaar is an area located on the right side of approaching 22 steps of the temple's eastern gate where a number of traditional (bhoga) sweet stalls are located.There is also a sit out place earmarked for the visitors with water facilities. Having holy food there is regarded very auspicious.The revised rules of the world-famous temple will come into effect from February 12, Kumar said, adding all people including the residents of Puri can have darshan of the deities by 6 am every day.Kumar said the devotees can enter into the shrine through the lions gate and exit through three other gates.He said the administration had decided to strictly implement a ban on spitting in the temple premises, an offence for which penalty is Rs 1,000.In the new sop, the SJTA said it was mandatory for all pilgrims to wear face masks at all times, both inside and outside of the temple and the devotees should sanitise their hands before entering the temple and maintain physical distance at all times as per COVID-19 guidelines.The SJTA also urged devotees not to touch statues or idols inside the temple."There is a complete ban on carrying polythene bags inside the temple. A fine of Rs 100 will be levied for each violation," he said.Lighting of deepas (earthen lamps) inside the temple will be permitted at designated places, he said.After remaining closed since coronavirus-triggered lockdown in March last year, the temple was opened in a phased manner from 23 December, 2020.While the servitors and their family members were allowed to enter the temple from December 23 to 25 evening, the local residents of Puri got opportunity to have darshan of the deities between December 26 and 31.The temple was finally opened to the public for darshan of the deities  Lord Balabhadra, Devi Subhadra and Lord Jagannath from January 3 adhering to the COVID-19 guidelines.The temple management had further eased the curbs and allowed devotees to enter into the temple without mandatory production of COVID-19 negative report from January 21 this year.

10-02-2021||New Delhi||‘Certain sections attempting to treat Muslims as others’: Hamid Ansari||Former Vice President Hamid Ansari on Wednesday said a concerted effort was on from certain quarters to regard the Muslims as others.He was speaking during a discussion on his recently released autobiography “By Many a Happy Accident: Recollections of a Life”, organised virtually by the Centre for Policy Research.Attended by former ministers and Congress leaders P Chidambaram and Shashi Tharoor, former MP Pawan Verma and former foreign secretary Shyam Saran, the discussion veered into nuances of secularism and Muslim identity.Chidambaram was the first to speak of what he described as the vanishing class of Muslim icons, such as Hamid Ansari, from public life.“I am a resident of Delhi and meet a number of people but I am not meeting enough Muslim people. I don’t find them. Are they being ostracised? Are they withdrawing? I can count Muslim icons of Delhi on my fingers. I think Hamid Ansari is politely agreeing with me and is as pained as I am that developments of the last several years are threatening those who are Muslims,” said Chidambaram.The Congress leader accused the ruling BJP of targeting the Muslim identity.“Muslim identity is being deliberately targeted in India and the current dispensation is targeting them viciously,” said Chidambaram.Ansari later added that there was an effort from a section of people to treat Muslims as “others”.The former VP said, “Yes I am pained because there is a concerted effort by some to regard Muslims as others. Am I a citizen or not? If I am a citizen I have the right to be a beneficiary of all things that flow out of citizenship. For me all my life the Preamble of the Constitution and its four principles, justice, liberty, equality and fraternity sum up the discussion of what we would want to be like.”Noting that a plural society is an existential reality in India, Ansari recalled the 2015 episode where he was questioned for not saluting the Tricolour during the Republic Day celebrations.Another time he was questioned by BJP’s Ram Madhav for skipping the Yoga Day event.Ansari said those exercises in targeting him were “rigged exercises”.“I know what protocol etiquette is. Yoga is a private business. I do yoga every morning. Why should I go around parading it. I was not invited to the Yoga Day event and I did not go to the function. When the PM is the chief guest, President and VP are not invited. Those who primed the controversies later apologised in some way or the other,” said the former vice president.Ansari also defended separate personal laws in times when the ruling BJP is steadily moving towards a uniform civil code.When asked by Pawan Verma why a secular Congress government overturned a progressive SC judgment in the Shah Bano case, Ansari said, “Politicians make judgements. You can examine in hindsight if those were the correct judgements.”To another question by Verma about why post Independence no attempt was made to change personal laws of other religions barring the Hindus, Ansari argued that Muslim laws of criminal jurisprudence had been dropped during British times.Ansari asked, “Can marriage, divorce, inheritance laws be uniformed in Indian society? The argument that Muslim law was not touched is not factual. Everyone was touched to the point it suited political convenience.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/certain-sections-attempting-to-treat-muslims-as-others-hamid-ansari-210547

So the question is whether the conduct of a judge can be discussed on the floor of the House or not,” he said.He referred to an article in the Constitution to contend that no allegation can be levelled against a sitting or ex-judge.The statement made by her was deliberate, the BJP MP added.Another BJP MP Nishikant Dubey demanded that Moitra’s membership be terminated.N K Premchandran, who was in the Chair, said that the notice is under consideration of the Lok Sabha Speaker.After BJP members had objected to her remarks, Moitra had tweeted on Tuesday, “It would be a privilege indeed if a breach of privilege motion is initiated against me for speaking the truth during India’s darkest hour.”Earlier, two BJP MPs in Lok Sabha had moved a privilege notice against Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.The notice has been given against the Congress leader for calling teen activist Greta Thunberg as ‘persona non grata’.

10-02-2021||---||SC notice to Maharashtra Government on NCW’s plea against Bombay HC’s ‘skin contact’ verdict||New Delhi, February 10The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued notice to the Maharashtra Government on the National Commission for Women’s petition challenging the Bombay High Court verdict that acquitted a man accused of child abuse on the ground that  groping a child's breasts without “skin-to-skin contact” didn't amount to “sexual assault” under the POCSO Act.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde – which had on January 27 stayed the controversial verdict and the acquittal of the accused – asked the Maharashtra Government to respond to the NCW’s petition against the January 19 verdict of the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court.It also issued notice to the accused on Maharashtra Government’s petition against the High Court verdict.The Supreme Court Bench asked senior counsel Geeta Luthra, representing the NCW, why it should entertain a separate plea when it had already stayed the High Court verdict and the accused was in jail.Luthra said the NCW Act provides that commission should move court for correction if any such issues relating to women’s rights arose.The NCW had last week moved the Supreme Court challenging the Bombay High Court’s verdict, contending the interpretation that physical contact meant “skin to skin touch” was perverse and bad in law.Last month, the Supreme Court had stayed the HC verdict after Attorney General KK Venugopal submitted before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde that the judgment would set a dangerous precedent."It is a very disturbing conclusion. Your Lordships should take note of this. I will have a petition filed tomorrow or your Lordships may take Suo Motu notice. The order will set a dangerous precedent," Venugopal had said.Following public outcry over the judgment, the Supreme Court Collegium had reportedly withdrawn its recommendation for confirming Justice Pushpa Ganediwala as a permanent judge.The NCW said the Bombay High Court’s decision “severely jeopardizes the interests of women and sets a dangerous precedent, which would have a cascading effect on the safety, security, integrity and dignity of women and children”.It contended that the HC verdict overlooked the very purpose and object of the Act – the protection of weaker sections of society. Such an interpretation will adversely impact the rights of women, who were victims of sexual offences as it additionally required proof of disrobing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-maharashtra-government-on-ncws-plea-against-bombay-hcs-skin-contact-verdict-210539
10-02-2021||Chandigarh||On attaining puberty, Muslim girl can marry anyone by law: Punjab and Haryana HC||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that a Muslim girl who is less than 18 years old but has attained puberty is free to marry anyone as per the Muslim Personal Law.A bench of Justice Alka Sarin gave the verdict relying on various court rulings and the article 195 in ‘Principles of Mohammedan Law’, an authoritative textbook by prominent Muslim personal law jurist Sir Dinshah Fardunji Mulla.Quoting provisions of article 195 in Mulla’s authoritative treatise on Muslim personal laws, the bench observed that a Muslim girl on attaining the age of puberty was competent to enter into a contract of marriage with a person of her choice.Article 195 in the book explains the “capacity (eligibility) for marriage” under the Muslim Personal Law, the bench pointed out, adding that “as per this provision, every Mahomedan (Muslim) of sound mind, who has attained puberty, may enter into a contract of marriage”.In the absence of evidence, a Muslim girl is presumed to have attained puberty on completing the age of fifteen years, the bench said, quoting the provisions of article 195.“Lunatics and minors who have not attained puberty may be validly contracted in marriage by their respective guardians,” the bench further elaborated.“The bench said the marriage of a Mahomedan, who has a sound mind and has attained puberty, is void if it has been brought about without his consent,” it added.Justice Sarin gave the ruling on January 25 on a plea by a Muslim couple, seeking protection of their life and liberty from their respective families, who were against the marriage due to age difference between the man and the girl. In Muslim law, puberty and majority are one and the same thing and that there is a presumption that a person attains majority at the age of 15 years: Counsel for petitionersThe man was 36 years old while the girl was aged only 17 years.The couple told the court that they fell in love about two years ago and solemnised their marriage on January 21 this year, as per the Muslim rites.The counsel for petitioners argued that “in Muslim law, puberty and majority are one and the same thing and that there is a presumption that a person attains majority at the age of 15 years”.The counsel further argued that “a Muslim boy or Muslim girl who has attained puberty is at liberty to marry anyone he or she likes and the guardian has no right to interfere”.The petitioners also alleged in the court that their life and liberty are in “grave danger” from their relatives due to which they have also sought protection from the Mohali’s senior superintendent of police.The judge after the hearing said the court has taken note of the judgements cited on behalf of the petitioners and also the fact that the girl in the instant case is aged more than 17 years.The judge further said the marriage of a Muslim girl is governed by the Muslim Personal Law.Both the petitioners are of marriageable age as envisaged by the Muslim Personal Law, the court said.“In any event, the issue in hand is not with regard to the validity of the marriage but to address the apprehension raised by the petitioners of danger to their life and liberty at the hands of private respondents (their relatives) and to provide them protection as envisaged under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,” the judge said.Article 21 of the Constitution provides for the protection of life and personal liberty and lays down that no person shall be deprived of his or her life and personal liberty except as per the procedure established by law.“The Court cannot shut its eyes to the fact that the apprehension of petitioners needs to be addressed. Merely because the petitioners have got married against the wishes of their family members, they cannot possibly be deprived of the fundamental rights as envisaged in the Constitution of India,” the judge observed while directing Mohali SSP to take the necessary action as per law regarding protection to their life and liberty.

10-02-2021|| Hyderabad||Kazakhstan opens consulate in Hyderabad||Hyderabad now has an Honorary Consulate of Kazakhstan. It was opened here on Wednesday by Ambassador of Kazakhstan to India Yerlan Alimbayev. Kazakhstan hopes to improve bilateral trade, economic and cultural ties between the two countries.  Alimbayev told media persons that Kazakhstan was India’s main trade-economic partner in Central Asia and the trade between the two had reached a turnover of USD 2.4 billion in 2020.This exceeds the total turnover with all other countries in the region and there is a huge potential to develop trade cooperation, he said.  The Ambassador said Kazakhstan was the biggest uranium supplier to India and had supplied 9,000 tonnes so far and India sourced nearly 80 per cent of its uranium requirement from them.He hoped that a new contract would be signed between the two countries once Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev visits India sometime later this year. India and Kazakhstan would collaborate in fields of energy, nuclear industry, IT, transport and logistics, food and processing industry, pharmaceuticals, investment.  Nawab Mir Nasir Ali Khan, Honorary Consul of Kazakhstan for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, said the Honorary Consulate of Kazakhstan, established in Hyderabad, would work towards bridging and strengthening the people-to-people and business relationships between Kazakhstan and the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kazakhstan-opens-consulate-in-hyderabad-210534
10-02-2021||New Delhi||Road to fighting climate change is through climate justice: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the road to fighting climate change was through climate justice and called for giving developing countries enough space to grow.Addressing the World Sustainable Development Summit (WSDS), Modi said two things would define how the progress journey of humanity will unfold in the times to come – “health of our people and health of our planet, both of which are interlinked”."The road to fighting climate change is through climate justice. At the root of climate justice is the principle of being large-hearted. Climate justice is also about thinking about the bigger and long-term picture," he said.The remarks at the Summit, which brings together a wide range of experts to discuss ways to mitigate climate change, come amid a continuing tug of war between developed and developing countries on who needs to do more to save the environment by reducing emissions.Noting that the sad reality is that environmental changes and natural disasters impact the poor the most, Modi said climate justice was inspired by a vision of trusteeship where growth comes with greater compassion for the poorest."Climate justice also means giving the developing countries enough space to grow. When each and every one of us understands our individual and collective duties, climate justice will be achieved," he said.Asserting that India's intent is supported by concrete action, Modi said the country, powered by spirited public efforts, was on track to exceed its commitments and targets set at the Paris Climate Change Conference in 2015."We committed to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 33-35 per cent from 2005 levels. You'll be happy to know that a drop of 24 per cent of emission intensity has already been achieved," he said.Modi also said India was making steady progress on its commitment to land degradation neutrality."We're well on track to setting up 450 GW of renewable energy generating capacity by 2030," said the Prime Minister.Highlighting the impact of his government's schemes in combating climate change, Modi said the Jal Jeevan Mission had connected over 34 million households with tap connections in just about 18 months and through the PM Ujjwala Yojana, over 18 million households below the poverty line have access to clean cooking fuel."The destination we seek is a greener planet. Our culture's deep respect for forest and green cover is translating into outstanding results," he said."I'd like to draw attention to two aspects - togetherness and innovation.  Sustainable development will only be achieved by collective efforts," he asserted.The World Sustainable Development Summit (WSDS) is the annual flagship event of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). Instituted in 2001, the Summit series has marked 20 years in its journey of making 'sustainable development' a globally shared goal.

It has moved the court seeking a direction to Haryana to ensure that pollutant-free water was released in the river. They have to keep an ammonia treatment plan in Haryana and even the National Green Tribunal had said their STPs are not working at Sonepat which is upstream, Arora had said.Maintaining that pollution-free water is a fundamental right which a welfare state is “bound to ensure”, the Bench had asked the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to submit a report identifying municipalities along the Yamuna which had not installed sewage treatment plants.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yamuna-pollution-sc-issues-notice-to-jal-shakti-ministry-djb-others-210532
10-02-2021||Beijing||China harps on ‘package solution’ for India’s bid to become UNSC permanent member||China, which has been blocking India’s efforts to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council, on Wednesday reiterated its stand on New Delhi’s bid, and called for evolving a “package solution” that is acceptable to all to reform the top organ of the global body.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin’s comments in response to a question came a day after India and China discussed a wide range of issues relating to top UN body.China is a permanent member of the UNSC while India began its two-year tenure as a non-permanent member on January 1. In August, India is scheduled to serve as the president of the UNSC.Asked about the outcome of the meeting and whether there was any discussion on India’s candidature for permanent membership of the UNSC, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang told a media briefing here that during Tuesday’s virtual meeting, the two sides held consultations on Security Council issues.The two sides exchanged views on upholding multilateralism, peacekeeping operations and counter-terrorism, he said.“As for India’s bid for permanent membership to the UNSC, I can reiterate China’s principled position on this. China has been a supporter of Security Council reform, advocating that the reform should enhance the Council’s authority and efficacy and that priority be given to the increased representation and say of developing countries, with a view to enabling more small and medium-sized countries to participate in the decision-making of the Council,” he said.“Efforts should be made to seek a package solution that accommodates all parties’ interests and concerns on the basis of extensive and democratic consultations,” he said.China is part of the permanent five (P5) of the UNSC with veto power has been stonewalling India’s efforts to become member of UN’s powerful body for years pointing to lack of consensus even though the other four, US, UK, France and Russia have expressed backing for New Delhi’s membership.Beijing’s all-weather ally Pakistan is also opposed to India becoming a permanent member of the UNSC.India and China on Tuesday held discussions on a wide range of issues relating to the United Nations Security Council, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in New Delhi.The MEA said the Chinese delegation was briefed about India’s priorities during its UNSC tenure in the meeting that took place in the virtual format.It said both sides agreed to continue their engagement on key issues on the UNSC agenda.

10-02-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19: Plea in HC to extend emergency parole of aged and ailing prisoners||A plea was filed in the Delhi High Court on Wednesday seeking extension of emergency parole of prisoners who are above the age of 65 years and prone to COVID-19 infection due to some ailments and medical conditions.The petition, which was mentioned through an online link and is likely to be listed for hearing on February 12, sought to defer the surrendering of prisoners above 65 years and suffering from comorbidities.The petition filed by advocate and social activist Amit Sahni also said that in the interest of inmates and jail administration, the aged prisoners be directed to surrender after all other prisoners.The plea said social distancing is not feasible and possible in jails here as they are already overcrowded and the prisons have been extremely affected by the pandemic.It sought direction to the authorities that the prisoners, who are COVID-19 infected, should quarantine themselves at their place before surrendering.It said the Delhi jails have a capacity to retain 10,026 prisoners and presently around 14,000 inmates are lodged there, excluding around 4,000 of them which were released on interim bail or emergency parole.Sahni also referred to the Supreme Court’s January 21 order extending the stay on October 20 last year of the Delhi High Court by which interim bail granted to undertrials in view of the COVID-19 pandemic was put to an end and they were directed to surrender on various dates.The plea said as the matter is scheduled to come up for hearing before the apex court on February 25, the directions issued by the top court relating to extension of interim bail to the undertrial should also be applied to the prisoners released on emergency parole.It said DG Prisons, Tihar Jail, despite being a party to the proceedings in the Supreme Court and being aware that the matter is pending before the apex court, had issued a circular directing prisoners to surrender on their due dates with effect from February 7.“The situation in Delhi jails is not such that one room/ barrack can be provided to each infected prisoner because a number of inmates are lodged together in a single barrack/room,” it said.It said the risk of severe illness increases with age due to coronavirus, so the prisoners be directed to be surrendered in a phased manner—age, disability and medical condition of prisoners.“The jail administration considering the overall situation must be directed that the prisoners above 65 years of age and those who are suffering from ailments be not asked to surrender for a further period of eight weeks because senior citizens are prone to infection. Further the prisoners who have misused the liberty of emergency parole may be denied such benefit,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-plea-in-hc-to-extend-emergency-parole-of-aged-and-ailing-prisoners-210529

A number of makeshift huts in the border area were also torched at that time.Mizoram shares a 164.6 km border with Assam. Several dialogues held since 1995 to resolve the boundary problem have yielded little results.

The incident took place around 10 am, soon after which attempt was made to rescue the victims. Two bodies have been extracted, while efforts are on to retrieve the third.According to eyewitness and survivor, Vijay Bhaskar, who was also travelling in the car, when the ill-fated vehicle was crossing the canal bridge near Kankapaka village, a two-wheeler came in the way. To avoid a collision, the driver turned right. The car fell into the canal as the driver lost control of the vehicle.Narrating the incident to the police, Bhaskar said three of the four occupants of the car were working for a trading company and had gone to Theegarajupally village for work. The fourth occupant – Saraswathi, a government schoolteacher – had asked them for a lift and joined them.“Initially, we recovered only two dead bodies, which were found 2 km  apart. One more body was spotted some 3-4 km away. We are trying to retrieve it. A crane has been arranged to fish out the car,” Naresh, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Warangal Rural, told the media.  Authorities have reportedly shut the canal gate as the water current is heavy, which is hampering their efforts to retrieve the third body.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/3-killed-as-car-plunges-into-canal-in-telanganas-warrangal-district-210519

10-02-2021||New Delhi||Indian Navy undertaking mega exercise in Indian Ocean Region||The Indian Navy is carrying out a mega war game involving almost all operational assets like warships, submarines and aircraft over a vast geographical expanse in the Indian Ocean Region to test the force’s combat readiness in a complex multi-dimensional scenario, officials said on Wednesday.          The biennial ‘Theatre Level Operational Readiness Exercise (TROPEX)’ aims to validate the Navy’s offensive as well as defence capabilities and safeguard national interests in the maritime domain besides promoting peace and stability in the Indian Ocean, they said.“Indian Navy’s largest war game, the biennial TROPEX 21, which commenced in early January is currently underway with participation of all operational units of Indian Navy including ships, submarines, aircraft as well as units of the Indian Army, Indian Air Force and Coast Guard,” the Navy said.It said the exercise will culminate by the third week of February.The exercise is taking place at a time China has been making increasing forays into the Indian Ocean region as part of its offensive military manoeuvre.“The exercise is being conducted over a vast geographical expanse in the Indian Ocean Region including its adjunct waters and is aimed at testing combat readiness of the Navy in a complex multi-dimensional scenario set in the context of the current geostrategic environment,” the Navy said in a statement.It said the conduct of TROPEX is being overseen by the Naval headquarters with participation from all three commands of the Indian Navy and the tri-services command at Port Blair.“TROPEX is being progressed over distinct phases that also test the Navy’s transition from peacetime to hostilities,” the Navy said.As part of the first phase of the exercise, the Indian Navy along with other stakeholders held a two-day mega drill in January covering the country’s 7,516 km coastline and exclusive economic zone.The ‘Sea Vigil’ exercise from January 12-13 was billed as India’s largest coastal defence drill, and it was aimed at validating the coastal defence setup which was revamped after the 26/11 terror attack.“Valuable lessons emerging from the exercise are being incorporated in the existing procedures to further fine-tune the coastal defence architecture of the country,” the Navy said.“Exercise Sea Vigil was followed by a large-scale tri-service joint amphibious exercise AMPHEX-21, which was conducted in the Andaman and Nicobar group of Islands from January 21-25,” it said.The amphibious exercise was aimed at validating India’s capabilities to safeguard the territorial integrity of its island territories and enhance operational synergy and joint war fighting capabilities amongst the three services, the Navy said.“The weapon workup phase of TROPEX, which concluded recently, witnessed multiple ‘on-target’ ordnance deliveries including missiles, torpedoes and rockets from frontline warships, aircraft and submarines and demonstrated the lethal firepower of the Indian Navy,” the Navy said.It said the ‘weapon workout’ phase also reaffirmed the Navy’s capability to carry out long range maritime strikes in the Indian Ocean Region, a capability that is central to meeting operational challenges and ensuring safe seas and secure coasts. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-navy-undertaking-mega-exercise-in-indian-ocean-region-210516
10-02-2021||New Delhi||My statement on LAC transgressions was distorted: VK Singh||Union Minister and former Army chief General VK Singh (Retd) on Wednesday said his statement on transgressions by the Indian troops on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) was distorted that gave China a platform to try and “cover their own aggressive tracks”.Singh’s comment about Indian troops crossing the LAC had sparked a war of words between the two countries prompting Beijing to blame New Delhi for the military tension at the borders.The minister also lashed out at the newspaper ‘The Indian Express’ for carrying out a sustained campaign against him.“For almost a decade, ever since I was the COAS, the Indian Express has launched a sustained campaign against me. A misinformation campaign that sometimes bordered on the bizarre, as was the case with the now infamous coup story, have repeatedly hit the headlines,” he said.Singh was referring to a news article carried by the daily on April 4, 2012 titled ‘The January night Raisina Hill was spooked: Two key Army units moved towards Delhi without notifying Govt’.Clarifying his remarks in Madurai on Sunday, the minister said he was purported to have said “India has been transgressing the LAC with China, five times to everyone ingress of theirs”.“This distortion could not be further from the truth. I had simply stated the established fact that the borders along the LAC have not been demarcated and until that is done there will always be differing perceptions,” Singh tweeted.The minister also added that the fact is that the People’s Republic of China has refused to settle the border as part of the bullying tactics they have adopted.He said that Indian side is aware of these tactics and any aggression will be responded to with equal or greater level as was the case in Galwan.Singh pointed out that in the race to create sensational headlines, newspaper editors must verify what was said and what is reported.“The distortion of my statement/reply has needlessly given the Chinese a platform to try and cover their own aggressive tracks and shift the blame on India,” he said.In Tamil Nadu’s Madurai on February 7, Singh, while addressing the media at a Circuit House, had said that China has transgressed into India many times over the years with its own perception of the LAC.“But none of you come to know how many times we have transgressed, as per our perception. The Indian government does not announce it, while the Chinese media does not cover it,” he said.“Let me assure you, if China has transgressed 10 times, we must have done it at least 50 times,” Singh claimed.China reacted to Singh’s statement and its foreign ministry called it “an unwitting confession”.According to the statement published on the Chinese foreign ministry’s website on February 8, spokesperson Wang Wenbin reacted to Singh’s statement and blamed India for the ongoing border conflict along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.“This is unwitting confession by the Indian side. For a long time, the Indian side has conducted frequent acts of trespass in the border area in an attempt to encroach on China’s territory and constantly created disputes and frictions which is the root cause of the tensions at the China-India border,” said the Chinese foreign ministry. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/my-statement-on-lac-transgressions-was-distorted-vk-singh-210515

The decision on the same is still pending. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/evms-ensure-proper-voting-show-correct-numbers-ajit-pawar-210512
10-02-2021||New Delhi||SC stays Delhi HC verdict asking schools to provide gadgets, internet to poor students||The Supreme Court Wednesday stayed the Delhi High Court verdict which directed private unaided as well as government schools like ‘Kendriya Vidyalayas’ to provide gadgets and internet packages to students from economically weaker section (EWS) or disadvantaged group for online classes during the COVID-19 lockdown.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde agreed to hear the plea filed by the Delhi government challenging the high court judgement of September 18 last year.“Issue notice. In the meantime, there shall be stay of operation of the impugned order of the high court,” the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said in its order.A division bench of the high court had directed that cost of gadgets and internet package are not a part of tuition fee and have to be provided free of cost to these students by the schools, subject to the right of private unaided schools to claim reimbursement from the state in accordance with provision of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.While staying the verdict, the apex court also issued notices to NGO ‘Justice for All’, on whose petition the high court had delivered the judgement, and others on Delhi government’s plea.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for Delhi government, told the bench that additional burden has been put on the state by the high court verdict.“We are already spending a lot on the education front,” Singh told the bench.The bench, while observing that the apex court had earlier delivered a verdict on a similar issue in a case arising out of Himachal Pradesh, asked Singh to place that judgement before it.The high court had delivered the judgement on a plea filed by the NGO seeking directions to the Centre and the Delhi government to provide free laptops, tablets or mobile phones to poor students so that they can access classes online during the COVID-19 lockdown.The high court had said that to separate such students from others in the same class due to non-availability of a gadget or a device would generate “a feeling of inferiority” that may “affect their hearts and minds unlikely ever to be undone”.It had said if a school decides to voluntarily provide synchronous face-to-face real time online education as a method of teaching, “they will have to ensure that the students belonging to economically weaker section (EWS) or disadvantaged group (DG) category also have access and are able to avail the same”.The court had said, “Segregation in education is a denial of equal protection of the laws under Article 14 of the Constitution and in particular the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009.” The high court had said that section 12(1)© of RTE Act requires private unaided schools to provide free and compulsory elementary education to 25 per cent EWS/DG students and that means “education sans financial barrier”.“Consequently, intra-class discrimination, especially inter-se 75 per cent fee paying students viz-a-viz 25 per cent EWS/DG students upsets the level playing field and amounts to discrimination as well as creates a vertical division, digital divide or digital gap or digital apartheid in addition to segregation in a classroom which is violative of RTE Act, 2009 and Articles 14, 20 and 21 of the Constitution,” it had said.The high court had also directed constitution of a three-member committee, comprising education secretary from the Centre or his nominee, Delhi government’s education secretary or his nominee and a representative of the private schools, to expedite and streamline the process of identifying and supplying the gadgets to poor and disadvantaged students.It had said the committee shall also frame standard operating procedures (SOPs) for identifying the standard of the equipment and internet package to be supplied to the poor and disadvantaged students.

Immediately he informed the management. The big cat quickly made its way out within seconds. This happened in the early hours, so no one other than the security were present in the parking lot.... such incidents are not a rarity, the place is frequently visited by the big cats,” Sanjay Koradiya, the owner of the hotel, told IANS.“Junagadh is a place for lions. The city is not segregated place from the sanctuary. The hotel is very well close to the railway station in the central part of the city. For some unfortunate reasons, the lioness seems to have got separated from its pride and it seems that the animal wanted to return to the wild. It happens once in a while. For the rest of the country, this incident might be a thing of sensation, but for the people of Junagadh, this is an occasional thing,” Dr Sunil Berwal, the Deputy Conservator of Forest, Junagadh, told IANS.“We have got a good healthy population of lions in the Gir Sanctuary and the local people are very supportive of the initiative and they don’t mind the big cats’ presence in the city,” added Berwal.“The lioness seems to be a younger member of its pride and must have lost its way to the wild,” he said.Koradiya noted that people in Junagadh have never had experienced lions attacking them. “However, the other big cats like leopards are known to attack people in the city,” he added. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lioness-strolls-around-hotel-in-junagadh-210505

10-02-2021||Lucknow||Congress will scrap farm laws if it comes to power: Priyanka Gandhi||Attacking the Centre over the new farm laws, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday told a rally in western Uttar Pradesh that if voted to power her party would scrap them.At a ‘kisan panchayat’ organised by the party in Saharanpur, the Congress general secretary accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders of “insulting” farmers who are protesting against the laws.“The three laws are demonic. If voted to power, the Congress will scrap these laws,” she said.She said the party’s fight will continue till the laws are scrapped.The rally is the first in a series of such farmers’ meetings planned by the party in western Uttar Pradesh, a year before the assembly elections in the state.When asked to comment on the Congress event, UP minister Anand Swarup Shukla said a “drama” is being enacted in the name of farmers.He claimed that “gangs” opposing the government have gone international, and referred to tweets on the farmers’ protest by foreign celebrities.He asked Congress leaders to “oppose Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but not the country”.Law Minister Brijesh Pathak said the BJP government was committed to help farmers and termed Priyanka Gandhi’s tour an “eyewash”.“Some leaders just want to be in the limelight,” he added.

10-02-2021||London||Scientists develop model to forecast timing of Indian monsoon||Scientists, including those of Indian-origin, have developed a new system which they say can provide farmers in India early forecasts of expected variations in the monsoon season, an advance which may help reduce crop losses.The researchers, including those from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in the UK, used their long-term global weather forecasting system to predict when the summer monsoon will start, and how much rainfall it will bring.In the study, published in the journal Climate Dynamics, they noted that the model provided accurate forecasts a month in advance for the timing of the monsoon in India’s major agricultural regions.The scientists believe providing this information to farmers could help them prepare earlier for unexpected heavy rainfall or extended dry periods, both of which regularly destroy crops in India.According to the researchers, the Indian monsoon brings around 80 per cent of India’s annual rainfall with even small variations in the timing of its arrival potentially having a huge impact on agriculture.“Accurately predicting these year-to-year variations is challenging, but could be the difference between prosperity or poverty for many families,” said study co-author Amulya Chevuturi from the University of Reading in the UK.“The forecasting accuracy we identified in India’s main agricultural regions provides a clear opportunity for this system to make a positive difference to people’s lives,” Chevuturi said in a statement.He believes a month’s warning of a drought or deluge is a valuable time to understand the likely impact on water availability and for the farmers to make provisions to reduce the threat to food supplies.“Better forecasts save lives, and this kind of in-depth global analysis is only possible when the best scientists and leading research institutes work together for the benefit of the whole planet,” Chevuturi added.The monsoon season in India begins around 1 June every year, starting in south-west India before spreading across the whole subcontinent.In the study, the scientists analysed 36 years’ worth of monsoon data to evaluate for the first time the effectiveness of the ECMWF’s latest seasonal forecasting system—SEAS5—in predicting how the Indian monsoon would differ from the long-term average.They compared forecasts from 1 May each year from 1981-2016 with actual observations of the monsoons that followed.The team found that the forecasts were accurate for the large-scale processes, like temperature and winds that drive the monsoon rainfall across India.According to the scientists, SEAS5 was good at predicting early or late monsoon arrival over the important agricultural regions along the river Ganges plains and the eastern and western coasts of India.The study could also identify deficiencies in the system, which the researchers believe could pave the way for model improvements, potentially providing more detailed and accurate seasonal long-term monsoon forecasts.However, the scientists said the forecasts tended to overestimate rainfall over the mountainous Western Ghats and Himalayan regions, and underestimated rainfall along the plains of the river Ganges in the north of the country, and its delta at the Bay of Bengal.They added that the predictions were correct for the monsoon rainfall pattern across India overall, making them useful for planning purposes. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scientists-develop-model-to-forecast-timing-of-indian-monsoon-210492
10-02-2021||New Delhi||Parliament passes Bill to provide autonomy to major ports||Allaying fears that the Major Ports Authority Bill, 2020 aims at privatisation of the country’s top 12 major ports, Ports, Shipping and Waterways Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Wednesday said it seeks to provide autonomy to these ports and boost their decision-making powers in order to compete with private ports.The Major Ports Authority Bill, 2020 was passed through ballot votes in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday with 84 votes in its favour and 44 against it. The Lok Sabha had passed the Bill on September 23 last year.Taking a strong objection to some members’ remarks that it is intended to benefit big corporate houses and would result in the ruining of the ports and their plunder, Mandaviya, in his reply to the debate on the Bill, said rather, it would turn these ports into world-class ports and enable their boards to take decisions on their own.“Would a patriot oppose this Bill? This Bill is not for privatisation of ports.... The Bill has nothing to do with privatisation. Former finance minister Arun Jaitley and former shipping minister Nitin Gadkari had also specified that there will not be privatisation of ports.... The Bill is not to sell ports,” he said.Various opposition parties, including the Congress, TMC, SP, RJD, DMK, AAP, CPI(M) and CPI raised objections on the Bill in the Upper House of Parliament and alleged that it is aimed at privatising the ports and diluting the powers of the states on land use. However, the BJD, JD(U), YSRCP supported it, saying it is a welcome move to expand the port development infrastructure.Mandaviya questioned: “Have Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra governments not given ports to private companies for development? Did that happen in the tenure of Narendra Modi?”He said the government, led by Prime Minister Modi, believes in the federal structure and assured the Upper House that “state government representatives will not be removed”.The minister said: “We developed the Kolkata port on the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. We paid the liabilities for all pensioners. The loss-making ports are now profitable. This is because of the reforms.”           He said disputes with private companies and PPP operators are cropping up, but the existing law has no provisions to deal with such issues and the new law will also help improve infrastructure.Taking a dig at the Opposition for opposing the Bill, Mandaviya said “the sky has not fallen” and the Bill was introduced after taking into account the major recommendations of the standing committee.Assuring the House to protect the interests of labourers, he said earlier, in the name of labourers, such people were made trustees who had nothing to do with labourers.No port is in operational loss for the last six years, the minister asserted and took a swipe at the Opposition, saying “Narendra Modi has 123 crore friends”.He also alleged that earlier, no one knew what happened in the name of dredging and digging sea.Recalling the country’s rich maritime history, where it traded with the world through the sea route in ancient times, Mandaviya said now, 4,000 km of inland waterways have been developed and made operational.As many as 300 projects are underway for modernisation of ports while coastal cargo has increased, the total cargo traffic has reached over 700 million tonnes and there has been overall efficiency in port operations.The Bill was passed through ballot votes after Deputy Chairman Harivansh ordered the lobbies to be cleared for a division vote.Secetary General of the Rajya Sabha Desh Deepak Verma explained to the members the changed procedure of voting, owing to the change in the seating arrangements in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Voting was done through division slips and not through the electronic system.The electronic voting system could not be used as the members were not seated in their usual seats due to social distancing.Earlier, participating in the debate, Sukhendu Sekhar Ray of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) said it follows the Singapore model of corporatisation and the next step in the offing is privatisation.P Wilson of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) alleged that the Bill has only been brought to serve the interests of private players and will lead to the mushrooming of private ports.Opposing the Bill, Ram Gopal Yadav of the Samajwadi Party (SP) said the government is trying to sell the assets of the country, while Elamaran Kareem of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) alleged that the Bill proposes to convert the port authority into a corporate entity and the assets of the ports will be sold off to private players.Manoj Jha of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Binoy Viswam of the Communist Party of India (CPI) and Narain Dass Gupta of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also opposed the Bill.Shaktisinh Gohil of the Congress alleged that it would facilitate the entry of private sector entities into the management of ports.“Like all airports have gone to a friend, this Bill has been drafted in such a way to give away these 12 major ports to another friend,” he said.Anil Desai (Shiv Sena) expressed apprehensions of discontent among the employees of the ports while Viswam saw “unseen hands...unseen brain behind the Bill”.Those supporting the Bill included BJD’s Subhash Chandra Singh, BJP’s Suresh Prabhu and Ram Chandra Prasad Singh of the JD(U).

The minimum functional repair to be undertaken for smoother operation of the plants with procurement of mechanical, electrical, instrumentation and catalyst items etc. shall attract an estimated expenditure of Rs 100 crores and therefore, the Centre has approved Grant in Aid of Rs 100 crores to BVFCL,” a cabinet statement said.BVFCL is situated at North-Eastern part of India, which plays an important role of economic growth in the region.The grant in aid of Rs 100 crore to BVFCL will restore the urea production capacity of 3.90 lakh MT per annum and ensure timely availability of urea to tea industry and farming sector in the entire North Eastern region, specially in Assam.It will also continue the existing employment of about 580 employees on permanent basis and another 1,500 persons on ad-hoc basis. Further, 28,000 people get benefits indirectly from this establishment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/another-pre-poll-sop-for-assam-cabinet-approves-grant-in-aid-of-rs-100-crore-to-bvfcl-210467

10-02-2021||Mumbai||No evidence against Arnab Goswami in TRP case chargesheet: Republic TV to HC||ARG Outlier Media, the company that runs all Republic TV channels, has told the Bombay High Court that the Mumbai police’s charge sheet in the fake TRP scam did not disclose any evidence against Republic TV and its editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, who is an accused in the case.In a rejoinder affidavit filed on Tuesday in the high court to counter the police’s charge sheet, the company said the police had “falsely implicated” its employees in the case.It said the entire case against its channels and employees arose out of an “unparalleled political vendetta” and a “deeply malicious witch hunt”.The company also said its employees had been targeted for the “fearless news reporting” done by the Republic TV on the Maharashtra police’s investigation into the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and Palghar lynching incident of last year.Rajput was found hanging at his home in Mumbai’s Bandra area in June last year.The ARG Outlier Media in its affidavit said Hansa Research Group, the original complainant in the case, had not named the Republic TV or its employees in its complaints.The company further said the Mumbai police’s crime branch too had not found any evidence against its channels or employees, and yet, the police named its channels and their employees, including their top management, as accused and suspects in its charge sheet.“The charge sheet though voluminous in weight is negligible in evidence against petitioners,” the affidavit said, adding “there is not a single shred of evidence of wrongdoing in the charge sheet”.The company has also alleged in the affidavit that the police harassed and physically tortured some of its employees, including Assistant Vice President Ghanshyam Singh.It said Singh, CEO Vikas Khanchandani, and some others were pressurised to implicate the Republic TV and other accused persons in the case.“It is a matter of public record that Mr Singh was physically and medically tortured in custody to falsely self incriminate, and to falsely incriminate his organisation,” the affidavit said.The company also said the purported WhatsApp chats between Arnab Goswami and Partho Dasgupta, the former CEO of Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), were selectively leaked by the police to “create prejudice”.It also said in the affidavit that no actual stakeholders, be it advertisers, or media houses, which were supposedly affected by the alleged fake TRP scam, had come forward as complainants in the case.The Mumbai police last month filed two affidavits in the case through city Commissioner of Police Parambir Singh, and ACP Shashank Sandbhor of the crime branch, saying the police had not targeted the Republic TV or its employees.The police said their probe was not a result of any political vendetta.A bench of Justices SS Shinde and Manish Pitale is presiding over a bunch of pleas filed by the ARG Outlier Media, seeking, among other things, that no coercive action be taken against its employees and the probe be transferred from the Mumbai police to the CBI or any other independent agency.The fake Television Rating Points (TRP) scam came to light last year when the ratings agency BARC filed a complaint through the Hansa Research Group, alleging that certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers.TRP, measured by recording viewership data at sample households, is crucial for attracting advertisers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-evidence-against-arnab-goswami-in-trp-case-chargesheet-republic-tv-to-hc-210454
10-02-2021||New Delhi||Republic Day violence: Dead farmer’s kin move Delhi HC for court-monitored SIT probe||The family of a 25-year-old man, who died after his tractor overturned at Central Delhi’s ITO during the protesting farmers’ tractor parade on Republic Day, moved the Delhi High Court on Wednesday seeking a court-monitored SIT probe into the incident.The petition, which is likely to be listed for hearing on Thursday, is filed by deceased Navreet Singh’s grandfather who has sought enforcement of his right to fair investigation and justice as well as the right to know the truth about his grandson's death.According to the police, the man had died as his tractor overturned at ITO where many farmers participating in the parade had reached from the Ghazipur border after taking a detour from the pre-agreed route for the march.The police had claimed that the man was driving the tractor and he came under the vehicle as it overturned.However, the petition said that as per eyewitness accounts reported in the media, Navreet was driving his tractor past the Andhra Education Society in New Delhi, and he was allegedly shot by policemen, due to which he lost control of his tractor which thereafter collided with some barricades and overturned.The plea, filed through advocates Vrinda Grover, Soutik Banerjee, Mannat Tipnis and Devika Tulsiani, sought a court-appointed and court-monitored Special Investigation Team (SIT) comprising police officers with a demonstrably impeccable record of professional integrity, honesty and efficiency, to carry out time-bound investigation into the death of petitioner Hardeep Singh's grandson.It also sought a direction that the SIT should file periodic status reports before the court to ensure a time-bound court-monitored investigation.“The petitioner's grandson was lying in a critically injured condition under the overturned tractor, however, despite the presence of a large number of policemen, including senior police officials, in the vicinity, no attempts were made by Delhi Police to provide immediate critical medical intervention to save the life of the petitioner's grandson.“Instead, Delhi Police resorted to teargas shelling to prevent other protesters from reaching the site where the tractor lay with the petitioner's grandson's body underneath. No efforts were made by Delhi Police to cordon off the site of the incident and to collect time-sensitive material evidence from the site, which was allowed to be erased and destroyed,” the petition claimed.It alleged that no steps, as mandated under the Code of Criminal Procedure, were taken by the police after the unnatural death of Navreet to carry out inquest proceedings.“In the face of such apathy and hostility by Delhi Police, the body of the petitioner's grandson was recovered by other farmers and later handed over to the petitioner's family, who took the body to their native place in Rampur, Uttar Pradesh,” it said.The plea said that the entire incident was captured by multiple CCTV cameras installed in the vicinity, however, the police cited technical difficulties and did not facilitate the farmers in viewing the CCTV footage.It said the victim's postmortem was conducted the next day at the district hospital in Rampur but the video or x-ray reports were not shared with the family.It said the medical/forensic experts who had reviewed the description of injuries in the postmortem report had independently made statements, reported by various media houses, opining that the injuries were consistent with firearm/gunshot wounds and that the said injuries could not have resulted from the tractor overturning, as had been repeatedly asserted and announced by Delhi Police.“The haste with which Delhi Police has made public statements declaring the incident to be an accident, as well as registered FIRs against senior journalists who have pursued the possibility of Navreet's death having resulted from a firearm injury, inspires no confidence in the petitioner that Delhi Police would conduct a fair and honest investigation into the death/murder of his grandson,” it claimed.The petition has arrayed the Home Department of Delhi government, SHO of IP Estate police station here, SHO of Bilaspur police station in UP and Chief Medical Officer of the district hospital at Rampur as parties.

Therefore, he mentioned that the licence had gone missing in the court.”Salman was arrested in 1998 for hunting two blackbucks in Kankani village near Jodhpur.At that time, a case under Arms Act was registered against him and the court had asked him to submit his arms licence.Salman gave an affidavit in the court in 2003, saying that he had lost the licence. He also lodged an FIR at the Bandra police station in Mumbai in this connection.However, the court later came to know that Salman’s arm licence was not lost, but had been submitted for renewal.Public prosecutor Bhavani Singh Bhati had then demanded that a case of misleading the court should be filed against the actor.A trial court in 2018 had convicted Salman and awarded five-year imprisonment to him for the killing of two black bucks during the shooting of the film ‘Hum Saath Saath Hain’ in October 1998. The actor had challenged the trial court verdict in the sessions court.Salman’s fellow actors Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Neelam and Sonali Bendre, who were present on the spot in Kankani along with him, have been acquitted.  — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/salman-khan-apologises-for-mistakenly-giving-fake-affidavit-in-poaching-case-210427

We have already pulled the ship towards the shore and also dismantled some portions of the hull, making it impossible for the ship to remain afloat now,” said Patel, after learning about the SC order from the media.“I have not received any notice yet from the court.But it is already too late for the ship to be used for any other purpose. Our legal team would submit a reply if a notice is served to us,” he said.The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered status quo on the dismantling of ‘Viraat’ which was in service with the Indian Navy for nearly three decades.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde issued notice to the Centre and others seeking response on a plea filed by a firm which seeks preservation of the ship as a museum.The centaur-class aircraft carrier, INS Viraat, was in service with the Indian Navy for 29 years before being decommissioned in March 2017.The Centre had in July 2019 informed Parliament that the decision to scrap Viraat was taken after due consultation with the Indian Navy. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nearly-impossible-to-reassemble-viraat-now-ship-breaker-210425

10-02-2021||New Delhi||SC rejects plea seeking formulation of national mortal remains management, disposal protocol||The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea which had sought a direction to the Centre to formulate a national mortal remains management and disposal protocol for pandemic and non-pandemic times to be implemented across the country.The plea was filed by a Delhi-based man who had said that the body of his mother was mistaken for some other Covid victim and was handed over to another person due to the negligence of a hospital here.The petitioner said that he was denied the sacred right of doing the last rites of his mother, who was not a Covid patient, due to the “callous action” of the hospital.The plea came up for hearing before a bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and RS Reddy.“You can intervene in the suo motu matter. You can file proper intervention application. These issues are being taken up in the suo motu PIL. Why should we hear a fresh petition?” the bench told advocate Manoj V George, who was appearing for the petitioner.The top court had last year taken suo motu cognisance of reports of improper handling of Covid patients and undignified disposal of victims' bodies in the country. The suo motu case is titled as ‘Proper Treatment of Covid-19 Patients and Dignified Handling of Dead Bodies in Hospitals etc'.George said this is not an “adversarial petition”.“My (petitioner) mother's body was swapped and I was denied the right of dignified burial to her. This can happen to anyone,” he told the bench, which dismissed the plea.Petitioner G Manohar had sought directions to all the states to formulate a state mortal remains management and disposal protocol for pandemic and non-pandemic times within a reasonable period.The plea had said that states should be directed to designate the district medical officer to be the appropriate authority for implementation of this protocol.

10-02-2021||New Delhi||India, US consult on Myanmar sanctions||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday night as an apparent follow-up to the Biden-Modi phone conversation the previous evening, especially on a common stand on Myanmar and deepening cooperation among Quad countries.On the human rights front, the coup in Myanmar is the first test case for the Biden administration with an avowed focus on human rights and democratic values. The frequent consultations with India would ensure that the impact of the impending sanctions does not adversely affect India’s interests in the region.Currently, India is in the middle of several major initiatives with Myanmar such as the transfer of military platforms including a submarine, finishing touches to an India-refurbished port in Sittwe, a connecting road to Mizoram and a highway to Thailand besides a large number of high impact community projects.With the UNSC unable to move towards a sanctions regime, US NSA Jake Sullivan has spoken of their inevitability by the Western block. At the same time, the State Department has made it clear the sanctions won’t be imposed without consultations with “like-minded allies and partners’’.Like India, the Myanmar generals will also not like being sanctioned in a manner that pushes them to a situation where China becomes their sole option for trade and security, said the sources.Though the US administration has termed the February 1 regime change as a coup, the generals have gone by the Constitution. After the President was unwilling to sign the order, the army’s nominee stepped in to approve, as the Constitution mandates, for one year. India may therefore prefer for the US to turn the screws gently, indicated the sources.The Quad was discussed by Blinken and Jaishankar and a few hours later figured at the US State Department briefing. The two Foreign Ministers discussed the “value’’ of US-India cooperation across the Indo-Pacific and said they looked forward to expanded regional cooperation, including through the Quad.The US read-out of the Blinken-Jaishankar conversation and the State Department said Quad aimed to “confront some of the defining issues of our time’’ including Covid, climate and democratic resilience.The quad had momentum and potential, and the Biden administration will build on it by deepening cooperation on areas of traditional focus including maritime security, said US State Department spokesperson Ned Price.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-consult-on-myanmar-sanctions-210404

We note the ongoing talks between the governments of India and China, and we continue to support direct dialogue and a peaceful resolution of those border disputes," State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters at his daily news conference.Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh since early May last year.In the ninth round of military talks last month, India and China agreed to push for an early disengagement of troops and resolved to continue "effective efforts" to stabilise and control the situation in eastern Ladakh.Responding to questions, Price said, "We are concerned by Beijing's pattern of ongoing attempts to intimidate its neighbours. As always, we'll stand with friends, we'll stand with partners, we'll stand with allies to advance our shared prosperity, security, and values in, in this case, the Indo-Pacific.” The spokesperson also said that the United States regularly engages with the Indian government on the two countries' shared commitment to democratic values."What I can say – and this applies not only to India but to every partner of ours across the board – we are committed to supporting democratic values, including a free and open civil society and the strong rule of law," Price said.Asked if the ongoing farmer agitation and human rights issues came up during the recent conversations that the top officials of the Biden Administration have had with their Indian counterparts, he said, "We regularly engage with the Government of India...on our shared commitment to democratic values. We believe it's the bedrock for the US-India relationship. It is actually in keeping, as you know, with India's own democratic values, its pluralistic values, and its history of tolerance."

On Monday, police got the first complaint that Yash Pratap has gone missing, from his uncle Shailendra Singh. He told police that the child went missing from a fair, where he had gone with his aunt Neeraj.An FIR for kidnapping was lodged into the matter.The police began scanning the footage of the fair but did not see the child with Neeraj.Yash’s father, Brijendra Singh, who lives in Etah district, said that his sister-in-law Neeraj told him on February 7 that his son has been missing from the fair.Next morning, she changed her statement and told him that she took Yash out of the house and closed the doors after she found that he had soiled the bed. Later, when she opened the doors after 45 minutes, the boy was missing.Police got suspicious after seeing CCTV footage and the changing statements coming from the woman.During aggressive interrogation, she finally admitted committing a crime and took the police where she had buried the body with the help of her 65-year-old father, Ram Bahadur.Her father has also been arrested on Tuesday.Superintendent of Police (SP) Farrukhabad, Ashok Kumar Meena, said that during interrogation, Neeraj told the police that after beating and smothering her nephew to death, she called her father and informed him about the incident.Ram Bahadur, who lives 60 km away from Neeraj’s house, advised her to bring the body to his place in Kampala and he would make some arrangements.The father told the police that his daughter took the body in a black bag to his house located under Kampel police jurisdiction in an auto.The woman, with the help of her father, buried the boy’s body in a deep pit in a forest.Meena said that Sections 302 (murder) 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC has been added in the FIR.The body was exhumed and the post mortem report revealed that the boy was smothered to death, said Meena, adding that several injury marks were also found on his body.The boy had been staying with his aunt in Farrukhabad’s New Fauji Colony for the past 7 months, as his father wanted him to study with other children.

All are safe,” her father tries to console her.“Dad, a man is standing on the dam’s barrage… Why isn’t he running away? Isn’t he scared of death? Oh Mumma, many will die today,” a frightened elder daughter joins in, her voice choking with grief.“Don’t lose hope. The God will protect them,” he replies, asking the girl, who inconsolably sobs, to record a video.“Raffu uncle is gone too,” the younger one cries. “Challe gaye, challe gaye (yes, they all are gone)… It’s a holocaust, an unforeseen one,” the man sighs as the flashflood violently makes way through the “strong” gates of the dam’s barrage.In shock, the family watches the nature unfold its sequence of destruction: A deafening sound shaking them up on an otherwise tranquil morning, a plume of dust rising into the sky and a ferocious wall of mud and boulders emerging from behind the mountains and wiping out whatever came its way.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/video-uncles-gone%E2%80%A6-doomsday-is-here-confused-father-consoles-sobbing-girls-as-family-watches-kin-swept-away-in-chamoli-deluge-210393

It’s fairly normal for government and private sector to solicit support and seek endorsement from celebrities and it’s up to each one whether to align with or decline it. This situation arose due to the laziness or inability of some of our celebs to rewrite content. To top it up, an investigation whether they were arm twisted?

Two bodies were extricated from the debris at Raini village in Joshimath today and the rescue efforts currently remained concentrated to the tunnel, which was ravaged by the deluge, said officials. Nepal alerts UP on sharda river surgeLakhimpur Kheri (UP): Officials in Kanchanpur district of Nepal have sent an alert to the Lakhimpur Kheri district administration, informing that one of its ‘under repair’ lake banks has developed cracks and may cause an increase in the water level in the Sharda river, known as Mahakali in Nepal. IANSThe missing persons include the labourers who were working at the National Thermal Power Corporation’s 480 MW Tapovan-Vishnugarh project site and the 13.2 MW Rishiganga plant. Some villages too were affected with houses being swept away by the floods.Operations on warfooting: Home Minister“Satellite data shows a landslide at 5,600 m triggered an avalanche covering 14 sq km area. This caused a flashflood in the Rishiganga. Rescue operations are on at a warfooting,” Amit Shah told Parliament.Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) personnel are part of the rescue operation, which is being led by the ITBP, a force equipped with trained mountaineers. “The work of clearing the second tunnel of slush and debris was underway through the night,” said ITBP spokesperson Vivek Pandey. He said the slush mounds were so high that they required heavy lifting through machines.Relief is being distributed by helicopters among the residents of the 13 villages cut off from mainland. Meanwhile, former Environment Minister and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh today questioned the rationale behind hydel projects in ecologically sensitive zones. “As Environment Minister, I came under sharp attack for stopping hydel projects on Alaknanda, Bhagirathi and other rivers in Uttarakhand on ecological grounds. We were not considering the cumulative impacts of these projects. I cannot help but recall that now in the wake of Uttarakhand disaster,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/165-untraced-hope-for-survivors-dims-210134
10-02-2021||Joshimath||Race against time... sensors, drones at work||A grim atmosphere is gripping the Tapovan hydel project site where multi-agency rescuers have been working overtime to find traces of life in tunnel-1, but have found none so far.“We are not giving up hope,” says Benu Dhar Nayak, Commanding Officer of the ITBP battalion in Joshimath, who led 50 personnel to the flashflood-ravaged site on Sunday morning and pulled out 12 workers alive from tunnel-2.All of 50 metres length, tunnel-2 was easier to access. But that has not been the case with tunnel-1, which is 2.5 km long, structurally challenging and flooded with slush, hampering rescue operations from the word go. At least 30 to 35 labourers are estimated to be trapped inside the tunnel at around 200 metres from the opening. High-power machines landed at the tunnel only yesterday and have cleared around 120 metres of debris.“So far, we have been able to enter only 120 metres inside the tunnel. We are using drones and sensors to locate life as project officials told us around 50 people were working inside at the time of the deluge. It’s taking too much time and we can’t say when will we be able to clear the whole path of this tunnel,” ITBP DIG Aparna Kumar tells The Tribune today.Kumar has been monitoring rescue operation at the site and coordinating with the NDRF and the SDRF.The team of rescuers has now been on the job nonstop for over 60 hours and it is getting progressively frustrating. “But our spirits remain high and we will clear the entire tunnel,” says ITBP Deputy Commandant Nilesh Sharma, the man who pulled out the first worker alive.An expert mountaineer, Sharma deployed ropes when the ITBP team breached tunnel-2 on Sunday evening and rescued 12 men alive. All these men, recuperating at the ITBP base hospital here, were discharged to jubilant families today.Sharma recalls how he entered the tunnel. “We used ropes. I had two jawans with me who entered the tunnel and rescued the remaining nine by Sunday evening while I rescued the first three,” says Sharma.The rescuers say debris remained a challenge even at tunnel-2 and a mud-loader JCB machine had to be used to clear its mouth and head inside.With precious time passing, rescue personnel appear overwhelmed with emotion as chances of survival of those missing dim. So far, the sheer courage and grit of the first rescue team of ITBP remains intact, as Nayak says, “We never say die.”Narrating the turn of Sunday events, he says, “I heard a terrible sound at 10.25 am in my camp office, 20 km from the NTPC project site. I checked with the local SDM to find out what had happened. In five minutes, I was out with 50 men to the project site.”At the rescue site, ITBP men divided themselves into two teams, one went to tunnel-2 and made some headway; the other went to tunnel-1 where it continues to dig deeper in search of life.In all, 425 ITBP men along with 129 of NDRF, 90 of SDRF and 124 of the Army are engaged in the rescue operation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/race-against-time-sensors-drones-at-work-210135
10-02-2021||New Delhi||US-India cooperation to expand under Biden||The phone call between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden late on Monday night indicated a widening of areas of cooperation between India and the US to include climate change and restoring global economy.The US President also assured continuing cooperation with India in fighting global terror, but also underlined that “the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld”.The US State Department and a member of the US Congress Foreign Affairs Committee have already underlined the need for observing democratic norms while handling farmers’ protests on Delhi’s borders. Several prominent Democratic Party members have earlier spoken against the Kashmir lockdown and the NRC. A White House readout listed five areas where the Biden administration wanted to work closely with the Modi government. These were cooperation in combating the pandemic, renewing partnership on climate change, rebuilding global economy, cooperating against global terrorism and continuing the close cooperation for a stronger regional architecture through the Quad.In his first foreign policy speech earlier this month, Biden had identified America’s “closest friends” as Canada, Mexico, the UK, Germany, France, NATO, Japan, South Korea and Australia. Having spoken to all of them, India was the next on the list. Biden also spoke to Valdimir Putin but that was due to the imperative of extending a treaty on limiting the number of strategic missiles. The White House touched on democratic values a couple of times and described them as the “bedrock” for the US-India relationship. It said both leaders also resolved that the rule of law and the democratic process must be upheld in Burma. In contrast, the MEA readout made a passing reference of shared democratic values and was silent on Myanmar. The three PM tweets did not touch on democracy at all.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-india-cooperation-to-expand-under-biden-210136

More recently he was given the charge of Kashmir in the DDC elections in the newly formed UT. Sources say BJP’s performance in J&K helped his return to place of prominence in Bihar. His entry in Bihar politics is being viewed with lot of interest. The three- time Lok Sabha MP has been a known baiter of JD-U supremo Nitish Kumar, who he blamed for his Bhagalpur seat being taken away in the last elections.Meanwhile, with three new faces from the region the BJP has given prominence to Kosi region to improve position in the Seemanchal region. Hussain in particular is expected to help the party’s chances in upcoming Bihar elections where Muslims play a major role.Hussain is among the 17 leaders, who also include Neeraj Kumar Singh “Bablu”, (a cousin of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput), to be inducted in the first expansion of Cabinet of CM Nitish Kumar after winning the Assembly elections last year. The Cabinet strength of the Nitish Kumar Government is now 34.All new inclusions are from the two major allies, the BJP and the JD-U.

However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan’s Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents. They often complain of harassment by the extremists.

Let us see how many lives we can save,” Rawat told reporters.Rawat, who reached Tapovan on Monday evening to review rescue efforts, undertook an aerial survey of the affected areas earlier Tuesday and also met 12 workers who were rescued from the tunnel on Sunday evening.Thirteen border villages of Joshimath block were cut off following the avalanche in Rishi Ganga river on Sunday.The villages that lost road connectivity in the wake of the calamity are Raini Palli, Pang, Lata, Suraithota, Suki, Bhalgaon, Tolma, Fagrasu, Long Segdi, Gahar, Bhangyul, Juwagwad and Jugju.Nearly 100 ration kits have been supplied to the affected villages by helicopters to ensure they face no dearth of essentials, officials said.Talking to reporters, Rawat said the priority is to get to those trapped inside the tunnel and save as many lives as possible.Additional heavy machines could be pressed into service to expedite the process of clearing tonnes of debris inside the tunnel blocking the path of rescue personnel.A portion of the Nanda Devi glacier possibly burst through its banks in Chamoli district on Sunday. It appeared to have triggered an avalanche and a deluge that ripped through the Alaknanda river system in the upper reaches of the ecologically fragile Himalayas.Experts, however, are still trying to determine the exact cause of the disaster in Joshimath. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/toll-climbs-to-31-in-uttarakhand-disaster-cm-rawat-meets-villagers-209973

This is not a small thing, this a big thing," Modi said.He noted that Azad had called him to ask for an all party meeting during COVID-19 period."I liked that and also did it. This kind of connection is there because he has the experience of both being in power and in opposition. Twenty-eight years experience in all, it is a big thing," the prime minister said.Reminiscing about their long association, Modi said that as chief ministers of Jammu ad Kashmir and Gujarat, both of them kept in touch with each other.Sharing details of their communication during a terrorist attack on some Gujarati pilgrims in Jammu and Kashmir, Modi said Azad was the first one to call him about the incident.With tears rolling down his cheeks, Modi said that Azad cried on the call while informing him about the horrific attack."Azad was the first person to call me. During that call he could not stop crying," Modi said with a choked voice as tears rolled down from his eyes.Azad later went to the airport when the bodies were sent back and kept in touch till the plane landed in Gujarat, Modi said."Power comes and goes but (only a few know) how to digest it...therefore like a friend, I respect him on the basis of the things he has done over these years," Modi said while wiping his tears and saluting Azad.Modi said he believes that Azad's concern for his country won't let him sit and whatever responsibilities he takes in the future would be beneficial for the nation."At a personal level, I would request him to not believe that he is not in the House. My door is always open for all of you. I will always expect and value your inputs," he said."I will not let you become weak," the prime minister told Azad as he closed his comments.Earlier, Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu described Azad as a voice of sanity in public life over few decades when he made valuable contributions while serving both in government and in opposition.Azad retires from Rajya Sabha on February 15 after being the leader of opposition for over six years since June 8, 2014.Naidu said Azad's retirement is particularly painful with the House having lost Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley.
