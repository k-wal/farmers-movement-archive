25-06-2020||Lucknow||Lucknow University students move HC against varsity’s plan to hold exams amid pandemic||A group of Lucknow University students on Thursday moved the Allahabad High Court challenging the varsity’s plan to hold examinations amid the COVID-19 pandemic.The petition, filed by one Jatin Katiyar and 22 other students of the varsity, has also demanded en masse promotion of students to next classes amid the COVID-disrupted academic session of the varsity.The petition, challenging the varsity’s June 19 & 23 notifications scheduling various examinations, has been listed for hearing by Justice Saurabh Lavania of the high court’s Lucknow Bench on Friday.In the petition, the students have argued that the examination controller has issued the schedule without going through the effect of COVID-19 due to which trains are not properly running, rendering varsity students, who had to return to their home towns and other far off places in the state amid the pandemic spread, unable to reach the city.“The students will have to look for new accommodations and it would be almost impossible to maintain social distancing in hostels,” the petition said.The petitioners also pleaded that three professors and some staff of the varsity were found coronavirus-infected and hence there would be a high risk of spread of infection in the campus.The students also questioned the success of online classes by the university.Citing examples of IIT, Kanpur, and Delhi University and other institutions, the petition also sought the court direction to university to either promote students en masse to next classes or consider holding online examinations, keeping in consideration the availability of internet and laptop to the students.

25-06-2020||Lucknow||UP child rights panel issues notice to Priyanka Gandhi over Kanpur shelter home remarks||The Uttar Pradesh child rights panel on Thursday issued a notice to Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, asking her to file a reply within three days for her “misleading” comments on the Kanpur shelter home.The Congress leader has also been asked to issue a denial of her Facebook post, with the panel saying the remarks were “without any proof” and hurt the honour of the girls lodged at the shelter home.   The Commission has sought her reply within three days and action under a relevant section will be taken against her if she did not issue a denial of her post, UP State Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairman Vishesh Gupta said.        The Congress leader in a Facebook post on Sunday had attacked the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh over a media report that 57 girls tested positive for coronavirus at the state-run child shelter home, with two girls being “found” pregnant, including one HIV positive. She had equated the incident with the Muzaffarpur shelter home case in Bihar, where cases of alleged sexual abuse were reported.                           The Kanpur district administration too had clarified that the five of the 57 girls who tested positive for coronavirus had come to the shelter home when they were already pregnant.The authorities had also lodged a case against unknown people for “misleading public” by allegedly claiming that two girls there suffered from HIV and hepatitis.Taking a suo motu notice of the Congress leader’s remarks, the Commission said her post was “misleading and without any proof”, which hurts the honour of the girls.The notice said some media organisations did misleading reporting without any proof to malign the image of the government.“The HIV reports of the girls are also negative. Due to the misleading post, these minor girls had undergone mental pain and they are hurt with baseless and misleading comments,” the notice said.

Persons having any co-morbidity like hypertension, diabetes, renal diseases etc would be shifted to COVID care centre/hospital.”     Earlier, Sisodia said corona-positive persons will not be required to visit COVID care centres for a clinical assessment for home isolation or hospitalisation.It has been decided to withdraw the Centre’s order regarding the requirement of COVID care centre visit by corona-positive persons at the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) meeting, he said.Sisodia said those found COVID-19 positive through the rapid test will be clinically assessed by medical officers on the spot.

25-06-2020||Chennai||Nirmala Sitharaman rues import of even Ganesha idols from China||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday there was nothing wrong in imports to spur growth but wondered why even Ganesha idols should be bought from China.Importing raw materials that were not available in the country and needed for our industries was not wrong, she said addressing the BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit workers via a virtual link.“There is nothing wrong in imports that would spur production and create job opportunities and it can be done definitely,” she said while speaking on the Centre’s Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan initiative.However, imports that could not bring benefits like employment opportunities and support growth would not help self-reliance and the Indian economy, she said.Ganesha idols made of clay have been traditionally bought from the local potters during Ganesh Chaturthi festival every year, she said.“But today, why even Ganesha idols are imported from China...why such a situation...can’t we make a Ganesha idol from clay, is it the situation?” she asked.She wondered if importing household products used everyday like a soap-box, plastic items or incense sticks used for pooja purposes would support self-reliance especially when such products were made locally by Indian firms and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.Such a situation of importing things that are locally made and available should change and self-reliance is the basic idea behind the Aatmanirbhar Abhiyan, she said.Self-reliance was practised in India for long, but it faded subsequently and now the Abhiyan initiative stood for local manufacturing, she said.“Self-reliant India (Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan) does not mean that imports should not be done at all. For industrial growth and creation of job opportunities here you may please do whatever imports that are needed.”   In her speech in Tamil, she referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as “Modi Ayya (sir)”, and listed out the “achievements” of the government in the past one year after her party returned to power at the Centre.She praised the valour of Havildar K Palani from Tamil Nadu who was among the 20 soldiers killed in a clash with Chinese troops at Ladakh on June 15.

Both these things are definitely comforting for Mumbaikars,” the BMC release stated.The city reported its first coronavirus patient on March 11 and after initial slow growth, there was a sharp spike in cases, especially when the virus spread to slum areas of Worli, Dharavi, Deonar, Govandi and other suburbs.On March 22, the doubling rate was just three days. It went on improving from five days on April 15, ten days on May 12, 20 days on June 2 to 30 days on June 16.Among 24 wards of the city, H-east ward has the highest doubling rate of 97 days.

High-skilled Indian professionals brought important skill sets, bridge technological gaps and imparted a competitive edge to the US economy. They have also been a critical component of the workforce that is at the forefront of providing COVID-19 related assistance in key sectors, including health, information technology and financial services.“The US has always welcomed talent and we hope our professionals will continue to be welcomed in the US in the future,” hoped Srivastava while pointing out that Indian skilled professionals had availed of the non-immigrant visa programmes to “work lawfully in the US”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-hopes-us-will-reverse-visa-curbs-in-future-104390

25-06-2020||Patna/Lucknow||Thunderstorm, lightning kill 110 people in Bihar, UP; PM Modi, Rahul condole deaths||Thunderstorms and lightning have wrought havoc in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh over the past two days, claiming 110 lives, leaving at least 32 injured and causing widespread damage to property, officials in the two states said on Thursday.The lightning strikes were more devastating in Bihar, where 83 people have lost their lives since Wednesday, according to the figures released on Thursday by the Disaster Management Department in Patna.More than 20 people have been injured in these incidents and hospitalised, they said. Meanwhile, in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, at least 24 people died when they were struck by lightning on Thursday, while 12 were injured, officials said in Lucknow.Three had perished to lightning strikes in the state on Wednesday, they said.Coming back to Bihar, the state’s Disaster Management Department said that Gopalganj district accounted for the maximum number of casualties at 13.Other deaths were reported from: Nawada and Madhubani (eight each); Siwan and Bhagalpur (six each); East Champaran, Darbhanga and Banka (five each); Khagaria and Aurangabad (three each); West Champaran, Kishanganj, Jehanabad, Jamui, Purnea, Supaul, Buxar and Kaimur (two each); and Samastipur, Sheohar, Saran, Sitmarhi, Madhepura (one each), it said.The lightning has also caused widespread damage to houses and belongings of the residents.In Uttar Pradesh, nine people were killed in Deoria, six in Prayagraj, three in Ambedkar Nagar, two in Barabanki, and one each in Kushinagar, Pratapgarh, Balrampur and Unnao, an official report released in Lucknow said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the loss of lives. “Received tragic news about death of several people in some districts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar due to heavy rains and lightening.

25-06-2020||---||India sidesteps public expression of discord with Nepal||New Delhi, June 25India has soft-peddled reports of the obstructionist behaviour from Nepal on flood prevention along its border with Bihar as part of its attempt to avoid commenting on issues of bilateral discord with its neighbour.It has also refrained from public expression of its views on Nepal changing its political map to include mutually disputed areas as well as on reports that spoke of a proposal to impose certain citizenship restrictions.“Both countries are coordinating on a real-time basis to minimise the damage due to flooding this monsoon season,” said the Ministry of External Affairs in an observation that contradicted media reports critical of Nepal putting up barricades and hindering personnel from crossing over to complete the work.“The embankment and anti-erosion works have already commenced,” MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava observed at a media briefing on Thursday.The MEA spokesperson also refused to be drawn in on other issues of recent discord with Nepal, including the changes in its Constitution to update a new map or the Communist Party of Nepal considering citizenship restrictions on foreign women marrying Nepali men.On the map issue, Srivastava said: “We have made our position clear on the issue and would not like to add anything.”On media reports of Nepal posing problems in trade and supplies at a border point, the MEA spokesperson again offered a boilerplate statement. “Trade and supplies are going on without any hindrance between the two countries, including at the Kakarbhitta-Panitanki border.”On the contrary, the two countries have extensive trade relations and bilateral trade has grown despite the lockdown.“In fact, in May, it surpassed $300 million. Despite the present challenging times of COVID-19, we have facilitated continuous and smooth flow of trade and supply of essential goods to Nepal,” said Srivastava.On the proposal to bar citizenship for seven years to Nepali men marrying foreign women, Srivastava was non-committal.“We have seen the reports on this. People of India and Nepal share deep-rooted and familial bonds. These bonds reflect the close civilisational and cultural linkages between our two countries,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-sidesteps-public-expression-of-discord-with-nepal-104382
25-06-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||China amassing troops along LAC since May, violating all norms: India||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 25India on Thursday said the “heart of the matter’’ behind the frequent incidents and face-offs along the LAC was the massive armament and troop build-up by China in the area since May this year. This has been accompanied by Chinese forces behaving in complete disregard of all mutually agreed norms.Calling upon China to sincerely follow up on the understanding reached between the two Foreign Ministers to ensure speedy restoration of peace in border areas, India cautioned that a continuation of the current situation would only vitiate the atmosphere for the development of bilateral ties.Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the deployment of a large body of troops and changes in their behaviour has also been aggravated by unjustified and untenable claims. The recent shift in the Chinese position on the Galwan Valley is one example, he said.Srivastava said the Chinese build-up had forced India to undertake counter deployments and the resulting tension has “thereafter expressed itself’’. This build-up by both sides, he said, needed to be reduced in accordance with a 1993 treaty to keep military forces in the areas along the LAC to a minimum level compatible with friendly and good neighbourly relations between the two countries.In terms of cooling tensions, the MEA felt the meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) after a gap of nearly a year was a “significant development’’.The MEA said neither the change in Chinese behaviour in recent years, which departed from a mutual understanding of set patterns of patrolling that avoided each other, nor the massive build-up on the border was in accordance with the provisions of several bilateral pacts, especially the key 1993 Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along the LAC.It all began in early May, when Chinese troops hindered India’s normal, traditional patrolling pattern in the Galwan Valley area. Though the ground commanders addressed this issue, the Chinese side sought to change the status quo in other areas of the Western Sector.“We registered our protest on the Chinese actions through both the diplomatic and military channels, and made it clear that any such change was unacceptable to us. Subsequently, senior commanders met on June 6 and agreed on a process for de-escalation and disengagement along the LAC that involved reciprocal actions. Both sides had agreed to respect and abide by the LAC and not undertake any activity to alter the status quo,’’ recounted Srivastava.But, the Chinese side departed from these understandings and sought to erect structures just across the LAC. When this attempt was foiled, Chinese troops reacted violently on June 15. Thereafter, both sides remain deployed in large numbers in the region, while military and diplomatic contacts are continuing, he added.Placing the incidents and face-offs along the LAC in a larger context, the MEA pointed out that respecting and strictly observing the LAC was the basis for stability on the border. It also reiterated its previous statements about Indian troops being fully familiar with the alignment of the LAC and having always built the infrastructure on the Indian side. Indian troops also never tried to change the status quo at the LAC, but that has not been reciprocated by the Chinese side, leading from time to time to face-offs. Changing patternsIndia points out that over many years, both sides have developed patterns of patrolling. It was a reasonable expectation that patrols will not be obstructed in the discharge of their legitimate duties. Unfortunately, over the last many years there has been obstruction to patrolling that often accompanies efforts to unilaterally change the status quo.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-amassing-troops-along-lac-since-may-violating-all-norms-india-104374
25-06-2020||New Delhi||India, China willing and able to properly manage differences: Chinese Ambassador Sun||Striking a conciliatory tone after rising tensions in eastern Ladakh to a fever pitch, China on Thursday said it was ready to work with India to properly deal with the border standoff while noting that “suspicion and friction” was a wrong path that goes against the fundamental aspirations of people of the two countries.In an interview to PTI, Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidon said India and China were able to properly manage their differences and called upon New Delhi to avoid taking actions that might “complicate” the situation in eastern Ladakh. He went on to add that at present, the overall situation in the China-India border areas was “stable and controllable”.“We hope the Indian side meets the Chinese side halfway, avoids taking actions that may complicate the border situation and takes concrete actions to maintain stability in the border areas,” he said.The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last six weeks, and the tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in Galwan Valley on June 15.The Chinese ambassador said “mutual respect and support” was a sure way and met the long-term interests of both countries, but at the same time, largely put the onus on India to ease tension in the region.“China and India are both large developing countries and emerging economies with more than one billion people, and both have the historic mission of realising our own development and revitalisation,” he said.He further said: “China and India are willing and able to properly manage differences. In the last few weeks, both sides have held a series of diplomatic and military talks to cool down the temperature even as Chinese military has increased its presence in all sensitive areas along the 3,500 km Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de-facto border.”At a weekly media briefing, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava, on Thursday, said the Chinese side departed from the previously agreed understanding in respect the Galwan Valley area and sought to erect structures just across the LAC.“When this attempt was foiled, Chinese troops took violent actions on June 15 that directly resulted in casualties,” the spokesperson asserted.He said the conduct of Chinese forces this year had been in complete disregard of all mutually agreed norms.The ambassador said: “Mutual respect and support is a sure way and meets the long-term interests of both countries; suspicion and friction is a wrong path and goes against the fundamental aspiration of the two peoples.”“Under the guidance of the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, we are ready to work with the Indian side to properly deal with the current situation, jointly uphold peace and stability in the border areas, and ensure a sound and steady development of bilateral relations,” Sun said.In their historic informal summit in the Chinese city of Wuhan in 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping underscored the importance of maintaining peace and tranquillity in all areas of the India-China border region in the interest of the development of bilateral relations.The summit had taken place months after a 73-day military face-off between the two armies in Doklam that raised fears of a war between the two Asian giants.In the course of the interview, Sun repeated the Chinese government’s stand — which has been rejected by India — that Indian troops are responsible for the Galwan Valley clashes, and indicated that the onus was on India to improve the situation in eastern Ladakh.“The onus is not on China. The Indian side crossed the LAC (Line of Actual Control) for provocation and attacked the Chinese border troops. The Indian forces seriously violated agreements on border issues between the two countries,” he said.After the killing of 20 Indian soldiers in Galwan clashes, India called it “a premeditated and planned action by China” and sent a veiled warning to China saying “India wants peace but if provoked, India is capable of giving a befitting reply”.Referring to talks between foreign ministers of the two countries on June 17, the envoy said both sides agreed to “fairly address” the serious situation caused by the Galwan conflict and vowed to jointly follow the consensus reached at the commander-level meeting on June 6 to ease the situation as soon as possible.Sun said China would not like to see a similar situation like the Galwan clashes, repeating Chinese foreign ministry's allegations that India was responsible for it.The Ambassador said the two sides kept the peace for decades in Galwan Valley, adding since the beginning of 2020, the Indian side has built facilities at or the crossing of the LAC in the Galwan Valley, “constantly changing the status quo of ground control”.On May 6, he claimed the Indian troops crossed the LAC in the Galwan Valley by night and trespassed into Chinese territory.“They resorted to violent means to create a standoff between the two sides and built infrastructures in an attempt to maintain a permanent presence,” he alleged.India has been maintaining that Galwan Valley belongs to it and has strongly rejected China’s claim of sovereignty over it.Sun said the Chinese side lodged representations on multiple occasions to the Indian side through military and diplomatic channels following the incident and that India agreed to withdraw its personnel from the area.The two sides held Lt General-level talks on June 6 during which they agreed on disengagement of troops from all the standoff areas.The ambassador said the Indian side promised in the talks that they would not cross the estuary of the Galwan river to patrol and build facilities, adding the two sides agreed to build observation posts on either side of the Galwan river mouth.“However, after the commander-level meeting, when the situation on the ground was already easing, the Indian border troops copped out on the consensus reached at the commander-level meeting, demanded that China dismantle its observation post,” he said.India has been consistently maintaining that Galwan Valley clashes had taken place on the Indian side of the LAC. The envoy said actions taken by the Indian side are not in consonance with the spirit of several agreements signed by the two countries.

An abundant warning to Ramdev that Maharashtra won’t allow sale of spurious medicines,” Deshmukh tweeted.“Claims of a cure for COVID-19 without sharing clinical trials, sample size details, registration with authorities can’t be acceptable. It’s great that @moayush banned such advertisements. There can be no compromise with public health and well-being at all,” Deshmukh further added.Earlier this week, the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) had ordered Patanjali to stop advertising the drug as a cure for COVID-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-bans-baba-ramdevs-coronil-104365

25-06-2020||Shiv Kumar||Sharad Pawar wanted to join BJP govt in Maharashtra: Fadnavis||Tribune News ServiceMumbai, June 25Former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis reiterated on Thursday that he had received feelers from Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar two years ago about joining the BJP-led government in Maharashtra."We had come quite far (about forming the government). But our senior leaders wanted the Shiv Sena to be with us even as we wanted to isolate the Congress. So we couldn't go ahead," Fadnavis said. Earlier this week, Fadnavis had made similar remarks in an interview with aMarathi news channel, where he had said that the senior Pawar had earlier supported the BJP but turned against it. "We had received feelers from Sharad Pawar and not Ajit Pawar. But the former turned against us," Fadnavis told the interviewerFadnavis, however, refused to speak on how he was sworn in as Chief Minister late last year for just 78 hours before being forced to quit after the NCP had second thoughts about joining the government. "I am planning to write a book on it. I don't want to give up the suspense," he said in response to a question.Fadnavis said that the BJP was approached by Ajit Pawar on the grounds that a three-party alliance would not be able form a stable government in Maharashtra.The BJP leader, however, insisted that his party was not exploiting the division within the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress coalition to topple the government. "This is not the right time for (bringing down the government). We are concentrating on exposing the government's failure in the management of Covid-19," Fadnavis said.Both the Shiv Sena and the NCP are so far tight-lipped on the revelations made by Fadnavis. Leaders of the two parties refused to comment on the matter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sharad-pawar-wanted-to-join-bjp-govt-in-maharashtra-fadnavis-104352

The doctor, who is currently in the USA, resumed work after defeating the deadly disease.She will feature in a Hollywood documentary film on COVID-19 warriors of Indian origin.Dr Pooja is among the five Indian doctors working on the frontline during the COVID-19 in the USA which has been included in a feature-length documentary movie, "A Pandemic: Away from the Motherland".The documentary is made by Sweta Rai, an Indian filmmaker in Hollywood.The movie showcases the remarkable contribution of Meerut-origin Dr Ankit Bharat, who is well-known for robotic lung surgeries and recently, performed pioneering double-lung transplant surgery on a COVID-19 patient.The other COVID warriors of Indian origin based in the USA, who feature in the film, include Dr Uma Madhusudana (Internal Medicine), Dr Shreedhar Kulkarni (Internal Medicine) and Dr Shantanu Singh (Critical Care and Pulmonary Diseases).As the film was shot during the lockdown, the filmmaker guided the doctors through a mobile app for shooting professional videos, like Skype, Zoom and WhatsApp video-calls.“Reducing the pain and suffering of patients is a satisfying experience in itself. I am happy that the efforts of the medical fraternity have been acknowledged and appreciated universally in the COVID era,” said Dr Pooja, daughter of Rohtak-based senior advocate Amarnath Bhatia.Dr Pooja is married to Sameer Malhotra, a software engineer based in the USA.Dr Pooja’s brother Vishal Bhatia points out that after having tested positive for COVID, his sister stayed at home in strict isolation for more than two weeks and got treated.“After defeating the disease, she resumed her clinical work and also gave her own blood-plasma for the treatment of COVID patients,” said the proud brother.It was a big challenge: Filmmaker Sweta RaiTalking to The Tribune on the phone, filmmaker Sweta Rai said it was a big challenge to shoot the film amidst the pandemic and lockdown and she was happy that they had made it.“The underlying idea behind making the movie was to underline the contribution of Indian-origin doctors who are working far away from their country. The film focuses on the personal lives of the doctors and their family members in the Covid era,” stated Rai.The Hollywood filmmaker revealed that she got the idea to include the Rohtak-origin woman doctor from her mother, who lives in India and had read a news report in The Tribune about Dr Pooja’s dedication towards the treatment of patients after recovering from Covid herself.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-based-rohtak-doctor-beats-covid-19-to-feature-in-hollywood-flick-104348

MM Naravane concluded his visit of Ladakh on Thursday after having made all the strategic calculations to meet any eventuality as the Indo-China standoff positions have made the situation fragile and fluid on the borders in eastern Ladakh.In fact, after assessing the situation on the ground and drawing strategies to counter any eventuality that may arise because of the continuing standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh, the Army chief has drawn a roadmap to maintain Indian position on the LAC, and also to ensure that no violent clashes and casualties occur in the sector that has turned hyper-sensitive in the military terminology.The situation had deteriorated after the June 15 Galwan Valley clashes in which India lost 20 soldiers, while Chinese stayed quiet about their casualties.It was a significant visit for the first time ever since he took over, a firsthand review of situation vis-à-vis Chinese aggressions was taken on the ground where exact stand-off and its strategic ramifications were unfolding for the region.These face-offs have been measured by the international community as “serious” and the calls for de-escalation have peaked.Gen. Naravane , who was scheduled to conclude his two-day visit on Wednesday, extended it by a day to  further review the situation as a downpour of reports of fresh intrusions by Chinese troops in Despang, Pangong Tso and diversion of waters of Galwan river started.The emerging situation called for a further detailed review of the situation and to work out plans to meet eventualities that made Gen. Naravane to extend the visit and draw the new strategies along with his commanders.The meetings were held at 14 Corps headquarters in Leh continuously for three consecutive days, beginning from the first day of his visit on Monday.The Northern Command chief Lt. Gen. YK Joshi and  14 Corps Commander Lt. Gen. Harinder Singh whose troops look after the boundaries in the whole of Ladakh sector, were  part of these strategic meetings.Gen. Harinder Singh, who had led the Indian side twice in military-level talks  with his Chinese  counterpart Major General Liu Lin in Chushul-Moldo area  along  the Line of Actual Control, briefed the Army chief about the nature of the dialogue and the body language and the moves that Chinese made during the  talks that lasted for hours together.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-chief-naravane-concludes-ladakh-visit-amid-indo-china-standoff-104347
25-06-2020||Vibha Sharma||China funded Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, says BJP; asks Congress to explain||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 25Launching yet another scathing attack on the Congress and the Gandhi family, the BJP on Thursday claimed that China had funded the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation.Armed with documentary proof, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the Congress needed to explain why the Chinese Embassy donated about Rs 90 lakh to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation.Also read: Why hasn’t India benefitted from your ‘strange bonhomie’ with China, Cong asks PM“They (Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi) are attacking the Narendra Modi government and supporting China because of these donations to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation,” Prasad said, also suggesting the Congress pushed for a comprehensive free-trade agreement between the two countries, causing grave economic losses to the country.“First, they give away land to China, then they take Rs 90 lakh as a charity. The Rajiv Gandhi Foundation was nothing but an extension of the Congress. Did they take permission before taking money? Did they inform the government why they had taken the money?” Prasad asked, calling it a gross violation of rules and regulations.Meanwhile, a petition has also been filed before the Supreme Court to seek probe into the memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Congress and the Communist Party of China signed in 2008.Prasad claimed not just the Embassy of The Peoples Republic of China in India but even the Government of the People’s Republic of China is a donor to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation.Making similar allegations earlier, BJP’s IT cell chief Amit Malviya also tweeted that “Congress President Sonia Gandhi is the Chairperson of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation. Dr Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi, P.Chidambaram and Priyanka Vadra sit on its board.”Prasad said the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation did several studies on how an FTA between India and China was desirable and required. Studies argued that India needed the FTA much more than China and should pursue it as part of its efforts to improve bilateral relations.Under the UPA, the overall trade deficit with China increased 33 times from $1.1 billion in 2003-04 to $36.2 billion in 2013-14, Malviya also wrote.Asking whether the donations to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation had any connection with the MoU signed between the Congress and the CPC in 2008, the BJP is asking “full disclosure” from the Congress.These donations to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, if you could still call them that, did have any connection with the MoU signed between the Congress and the CPC in 2008, it said.Speaking during the Madhya Pradesh Jan Samvad Rally, BJP president JP Nadda said he was amazed that the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation received money from China.“I saw television and I was shocked and surprised to know that the People’s Republic of China and the Chinese Embassy gave $3,00,000 to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) in 2005-06,” he claimed.“This is the secret relation of Congress and China,” he said.Accusing Rahul Gandhi of trying to “divide the nation and demoralise” the armed forces during crucial situations, Nadda said: “First, the Congress signs an MoU with the Chinese Communist Party, then the Congress surrenders land to China. During the Doklam issue, Rahul Gandhi secretly went to the Chinese embassy and during crucial situations, he tries to divide the nation and demoralise armed forces. Effects of the MoU?”Sonia Gandhi was the chairperson of RGF, while former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi and P Chidambaram were members of the board when the donation was made, he said.“The country wants to know why the funds were given to the Foundation? What studies were carried out for that nation?” Nadda said.Nadda, in his remarks, said: “Due to the mistakes of one family we lost 43,000 sq kilometres,” adding the Congress had no moral right to speak about India's security.He also alleged that during Doklam stand-off between India and China in 2017, bonhomie prevailed between Rahul Gandhi and Chinese officials in Delhi.Due to weak Congress governments in the past, China was in possession of Indian land, the BJP chief alleged.He also alleged that amid tensions in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control and the coronavirus crisis, the Congress was not playing the role of a responsible opposition.Congress terms RGF donation issue an attempt to divert people’s attentionResponding to the claims by the BJP, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said: “Please stop living in 2005 and start answering questions in 2020.”At a press conference, he said when the country wants to know answers on the issues concerning securing the borders and Chinese transgression, the BJP is trying to divert the attention of the nation.Attempts were being made to divert the attention from issues of national security, territorial integrity and the Chinese transgression in Indian territory, he said.Later, Surjewala also told PTI: “This (making allegations) is an act of classical BJP’s desperation, diversion and disinformation and should be rejected with the contempt it deserves.”Meanwhile, the Congress sources said in 2005, there was an equivalent matching grant given by the governments of India and China to the RGF for helping the disabled as also undertaking studies by researchers on Indo-China relationship.The grant had been duly audited by the Income Tax department and all other authorities, the sources said. — With inputs from PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-funded-rajiv-gandhi-foundation-says-bjp-asks-congress-to-explain-104345

It is the Pakistan government’s moral and legal responsibility to protect minorities in its territory,” Gill said.Escalating the matter, Sangat's national executive president Davinder Singh Gujral urged the world community to call out Pakistan with regard recurring violation of human rights of the minorities and their religious persecution.“The Rashtriya Sikh Sangat urges the UNO to weigh in against Pakistan to ensure religious and social harmony,” Gujral said, adding that the targeting of the minorities, including Sikhs, in Pakistan was very disconcerting.He said the Sikh Gurus had always espoused the cause of justice and protection of rights of the minorities and had left rich tradition as “legacy of universal and transcendental humanism”.Reports say that the girl kidnapped in Jacobabad, Sindh, was married off to a Muslim man after her forceful conversion of religion this week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rashtriya-sikh-sangat-condemns-kidnapping-of-hindu-girl-in-pakistan-104339

25-06-2020||New Delhi||Congress seeks virtual Parliament session to discuss LAC stand-off||The Congress on Thursday demanded that the government convene a virtual session of Parliament to discuss important issues before the country, especially the border standoff with China.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said during the 1962 war, then BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee demanded that a session of Parliament be convened to discuss it and then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru accepted his demand.“A session of Parliament should be convened to discuss important issues. The Parliamentary Committees are also not meeting, even when there are key issues to be discussed,” Khera said at a press conference.The Congress leader said Parliament is the only medium where everyone can discuss the key issues and together work out a strategy to deal with them.Party spokesperson Manish Tewari on Wednesday accused the government of hiding behind rules to escape parliamentary oversight and demanded that a session be held soon to answer key queries of opposition parties.“This government has walked the extra mile to hide behind rules, to escape parliamentary oversight. This is nothing short of the emasculation of Parliament,” he said.“Unfortunately, presiding officers of both the Houses should have walked the extra mile to prevail upon the government, not should try to subvert Parliament in this manner and escape parliamentary oversight,” he said.His colleague and party spokesperson Gaurav Gogoi cited the government’s experience of having conducted a bilateral summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart.“Surely we can have a special session of Parliament to discuss important issues, keeping in mind both social distancing and the importance of national security,” Gogoi said.“It is a sign of authoritarianism and only an effort by the BJP government to buy time so that it can escape the questions which have been asked by the people of India through the major opposition parties,” Gogoi alleged.Tewari said it is extremely unfortunate and regretful that while one can have a Russia, India, China trilateral summit virtually, the G-20 can be held and an all-party meeting on China can be held virtually, “why can’t this government hold a virtual session of Parliament”.Opposition members, especially from the Congress, have been demanding a Parliament session to discuss key issues confronting the country like the coronavirus pandemic and the “Chinese intrusions into India at Ladakh”.

Launched in 2019, it was implemented by the Union Jal Shakti Ministry.Union Jal Shakti Ministry officials said as of May-end this year, Functional Household Tap Connections (FHTC) had been provided to 2,000 of the total 44,000 households in Ladakh.“The Ladakh Administration is committed to cover remaining households by March 2022,” said a Ministry source.The officials of Ladakh recently assured the Ministry to complete the project by March 2022. This was during a presentation on the status of the JJM implementation to seek the approval of the UT’s Annual Action Plan for the financial year 2020-2021.The assured fund of Rs 428 Crore is available with the UT during 2020-21 for the JJM.The poor implementation of the project in Ladakh presents tough and high-altitude geographical terrain and hostile weather condition. The traditional technology harnessed for laying the pipes and supply of water is inadequate.There were incidents of the network of water pipes bursting owing to varying pressures in them due to undulating terrain.Also, with Ladakh, earlier being part of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, the focus on it was comparatively less, including with regard implementation of government schemes.A peculiar feature of the area is that the villages and habitations have their own unique problems, unlike in the plains.Hence, concentration will be greater on village specific plans for the project.The Ministry officials feel that now the JJM project will get some momentum.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amidst-military-face-off-with-china-centre-focus-on-jal-jeevan-mission-in-ladakh-104330
25-06-2020||New Delhi||Why hasn’t India benefitted from your ‘strange bonhomie’ with China: Cong asks PM||The Congress on Thursday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi why had India not gained anything from the “strange bonhomie” which it claimed he shared with China.Seeking to turn the tables on the ruling party, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said the BJP also shared bonhomie with the Communist Party of China (CPC) with several party-level exchanges taking place in the past.Also read: China funded Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, says BJP; asks Congress to explain*45th anniversary of Emergency: Modi, BJP launch attack on Cong, GandhisHe sought to know whether India's borders have become safe after these exchanges in the last many years.The Congress leader asked what has the country gained out of these exchange delegations and why were the borders insecure despite the bonds that the two ruling parties of India and China shared with each other.“There is a strange kind of bonhomie between Narendra Modi and China, a two-decade-old bonhomie. Why doesn’t the country get the benefit of that bonhomie,” he asked at a virtual press conference.Khera said all that the Congress would continue to question is about the political will that just did not get visible when it came to China.“Whatever is happening on the border today, is it despite the bonhomie which you have with China, or is it because of the bonhomie which you have with China. The country needs to know,” he asked.“We do want to ask you, if as president of the party, Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari and Amit Shah have been sending delegations, strengthening the bonds between the Communist Party of China and the BJP. What has the country gained out of these bonds? Why are the borders insecure despite these bonds that you have,” he added.The ruling has hit out at the Congress for signing an MoU with China’s Communist Party and has questioned its “bond” with the ruling party in China.Khera also asked what role did the India Foundation, an organisation run by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval's son has in strengthening the bonds with China.“Why does India Foundation keep visiting these countries? Who do they meet? What's the outcome? What's the role of NSA Ajit Doval's son- Shaurya Doval? Does he keep attending these meetings through India Foundation? These are important questions in the light of what is happening,” he asked.Khera said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was showing “red eyes” to those who were asking him questions instead of showing them to the enemy.“It is time to stand with the Army and show red eyes to China,” he said.The Congress leader said questions will be asked to Modi especially when there are definitive reports, satellite images of incursions in the Ladakh region of India by the Chinese.He alleged that China laps up the comment of Modi and uses it across the world that the Indian prime minister says that China is in its own territory and Galwan is theirs.“After a lot of pressure, PMO contradicted what the prime minister said. This kind of a goof-up is unpardonable,” he alleged. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-hasnt-india-benefitted-from-your-strange-bonhomie-with-china-cong-asks-pm-104328

25-06-2020||New Delhi||45th anniversary of Emergency: Modi, BJP launch attack on Cong, Gandhis||Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP on Thursday lashed out at the Congress on the 45th anniversary of Emergency, reminding it of all the “excesses” during the period.Prime Minister Modi paid homage to all those who participated in the “struggle to protect democracy, withstanding all torture.”“The country will not be able to forget their sacrifices,” the Prime Minister said in his post on social media.Top BJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda, remembered those who resisted “anti-democratic forces” and slammed the “dynastic grip and totalitarian mindset” of the Congress party.The BJP also posted a blog by late Arun Jaitley, ‘The Emergency Revisited: The circumstances leading to the imposition of Emergency’.आज से ठीक 45 वर्ष पहले देश पर आपातकाल थोपा गया था। उस समय भारत के लोकतंत्र की रक्षा के लिए जिन लोगों ने संघर्ष किया, यातनाएं झेलीं, उन सबको मेरा शत-शत नमन! उनका त्याग और बलिदान देश कभी नहीं भूल पाएगा। pic.twitter.com/jlQVJQVrsX  In a post, ‘Emergency 1975- The unforgivable sin of Congress’, it also talked of “forcible sterilization (the dreaded nasbandi) that created a strong terror wave throughout the country”.“Millions of helpless people were subjected to forcible sterilisation and many lost their lives.“RSS defied the ban imposed on it and thousands participated in Satyagraha (peaceful protests) against the ban and against the curtailment of fundamental rights.“According to a report of the International Human Rights Organisation, 1, 40, 000 people were arrested without trial during then Congress Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s Emergency.“Before the President’s signature on the declaration papers, top national leaders like JP Narayan, Morarji Desai, LK Advani and AB Vajpayee along with hundreds of others had been imprisoned overnight,” it said.As one of India’s opposition parties, Congress needs to ask itself:Why does the Emergency mindset remain?Why are leaders who don’t belong to 1 dynasty unable to speak up?Why are leaders getting frustrated in Congress?Else, their disconnect with people will keep widening.  According to Shah, “On this day, 45 years ago one family’s greed for power led to the imposition of the Emergency. Overnight the nation was turned into a prison. The press, courts, free speech...all were trampled over. Atrocities were committed on the poor and downtrodden.“Due to efforts of lakhs of people, the Emergency was lifted. Democracy was restored in India but it remained absent in the Congress. The interests of one family prevailed over party interests and national interests. This sorry state of affairs thrives in today’s Congress too!"Union Minister Piyush Goyal called Emergency “the darkest period in independent India’s history” while his counterpart Jitendra Singh wrote, “History will always recall it as a black day of Indian democracy....”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/45th-anniversary-of-emergency-modi-bjp-launch-attack-on-cong-gandhis-104306

We have all been savouring his pani-puris and other snacks since years," said a resident Girish Agarwal, who launched the crowd-funding drive to Yadav's family comprising wife and a daughter who is a Maths teacher."So far, there are contributions of around Rs 2.53 lakh from some 125 plus of his patrons in India and abroad, on the platform, www.ketto.org fundraiser for the panipuriwala," Agarwal told IANS."While we can try to find another snacking spot, his family will gravely miss a loving father, husband, and provider. They need our support. That's why we've created this page to contribute whatever you feel fit. And will make sure your generosity reaches his wife and his daughter Kusum," he said in the appeal.Another resident A. Shah said that he had been frequenting Yadav's stall for over three decades for the hygiene and "unchanged taste" he always maintained, and he was sad to learn of his passing.Many of his regular patrons were not even aware of his name, but over a couple of months ago, started missing him when his stall did not open for days in the evening.Enquiries revealed that he was a diabetic and had been admitted to a hospital and in the third week of May, succumbed to Covid-19, shocking the local residents.It also transpired that he was the sole breadwinner for his family and the crowd-funding initiative is intended to help them after his sudden demise, added Agarwal.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbaikars-raise-rs-2-50-lakh-for-family-of-covid-victim-104301

Earlier people used to dump garbage in the area where the temple now stands. A priest comes to the temple twice every day and offers puja,” says Chung (73), an inhabitant of Kolkata’s Chinatown located in the Tangra area of the city.The “Chinese Kali Mandir”, dedicated to the popular Hindu goddess, is just a stone’s throw away from Chung’s residence. With his children settled in Canada and his restaurant closed due to the lockdown, Chung, whose parents had come to Kolkata from China, passes time having endless cups of tea supplied by the neighbourhood chaiwallah and gazing at photographs of grandchildren sent to him from Toronto.“I do not want to shift to Canada. I like it being here. I was born in Kolkata in 1947 when the country became independent,” the septuagenarian restaurant-owner says proudly.Global Times, an English tabloid brought out from Beijing by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC), recently ran a story with the headline “Chinese in India say they are being harassed amid rising anti-China sentiment following border clash”.Quoting unnamed sources, the daily described how the campaign against Chinese products and other anti-China protests taking place in the country were making Chinese people living in India nervous.However, contrary to the claim made by the Beijing paper, residents of Kolkata’s Chinatown, which boasts of having the largest concentration of people of Chinese origin in the country, do not betray any feeling of insecurity.“We are Indians. I was born here and I am going to be buried here one day,” says Katy Ku, an elderly Chinese origin woman, when asked if she ever thought that the recent conflict between the two armies could prove costly for her and others of her ethnicity living in the area.A tour of the neighbourhood makes it clear that more than the Galwan Valley flare-up, it is the coronavirus pandemic originating in China that poses a bigger problem here.A large number of people in the locality earn their livelihood from the restaurant business. The lockdown ordered to arrest the spread of the virus and the consequent closure of restaurants has dealt those associated with the business a crushing blow.“The border clash has no impact on us. But the lockdown has. I was working in a restaurant but lost my job,” said Hsiung, a middle-aged man of Hakka Chinese origin.Lee, an elderly man of Chinese origin man and Thomas, a young inhabitant, also reported having lost their jobs as a result of the lockdown.Residents admitted having seen on television pictures of smashing of Chinese products and other anti-China protests but said that they did not feel threatened by the protests.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pandemic-not-border-clash-troubles-chinatown-residents-in-kolkata-104285

25-06-2020||New Delhi||Growth in coronavirus cases will flatten in July-end or August-beginning, says AIIMS director||India has jumped past 4.5 lakh coronavirus cases and 14,476 people have succumbed to the viral infection so far. In this backdrop, speaking to IANS in an exclusive interview, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said India is also vulnerable to second wave of coronavirus and people should continue to follow social distancing, wearing mask and other precautions, after cases begin to decline.He added that in order to contain the outbreak of Covid-19, a limited lockdown in hotspots, where volume of cases is very high, may be considered along with a micro-plan to prevent leakage of cases from these areas to other non-containment areas. Excerpts of the interview are below: Q: Reports say China and South Korea are witnessing a second wave of coronavirus infection, what is this second wave, is India also vulnerable to this?A: When cases come down significantly, people tend to drop their guard against the viral infection, and this leads to the second wave (which means a sudden increase in the number of cases). After cases begin to decline, people should continue to follow the precautions -- continue to maintain social distancing and wear masks regularly. See what happened in Singapore, it was struck by a second wave of coronavirus. Look, what happened in the 1918 pandemic, people dropped their guard and the second wave of viral infection struck back. If people do not follow social distancing then the spike in cases is apparent. We need to take these precautions at least for one year. India is also vulnerable to this second wave.Q: If Covid-19 cases continue to rise rapidly, do you think we need another lockdown in areas where volume of cases are very high?A: A large volume of cases is concentrated in specific areas like hotspots, and in order to maintain things in order, we may need a limited lockdown in these areas. This should be followed by a micro-plan which entails extensive testing of people and also extensive contact tracing of people who have got in touch with positive people. Need to ensure there is no leakage of cases from these areas. People from these areas should not mix with others in non-containment areas. This will aid in containing the outbreak of the virus. People who have developed symptoms should get themselves tested, especially in the containment areas. Q: With more than 4.5 lakh cases and close to 14,500 deaths, do you think India has reached its peak and a decline in cases is prominent?A: The cases will continue to increase for some time. The doubling time of cases has also increased. But, the cases will also begin to flatten. Though, it is difficult to give an exact time period in this viral infection, it seems, the growth in cases will flatten in the end of July or beginning of August. A decline will come to this viral infection, but it does not mean that people should drop their guard. As a measure, we need to decrease community participation and citizens should continue to follow social distancing. People should get themselves tested. All these efforts will help in preventing people from contracting this virus. These precautions will also prevent us from the second wave, and we must continue to take precautions. The virus has not gone away, it is still lurking.Q: India has crossed the 4.5 lakh coronavirus cases so far, although our recovery rate is good, but still 10,000 to 15,000 cases are reported daily. Why do cases continue to spiral, what is the reason?A: We have to remember a few things -- the bulk of cases are in 10 cities, nearly 70 per cent, and if we take into account cases per million population, the number is not very high, as compared with countries including countries in Europe. Many European countries put together still do not add up to the Indian population. Do not compare India to countries like Italy, Spain etc. We need to focus on hotspots, which contribute to between 70 -80 per cent of cases, and we have to identify cases in these areas at an early stage. The population density is very high in these cities. People in lower socio-economic status are highly vulnerable to the viral infection, as many live together in small spaces and there is a lot of mixing of people happening there. Look at the market places, people are not following social distancing and not wearing masks. In fact, many are in close vicinity of each other.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/growth-in-coronavirus-cases-will-flatten-in-july-end-or-august-beginning-says-aiims-director-104277

India has the highest TB burden in the world.“TB notifications in 2019 rose by 14 per cent over 2018. We were missing 10 lakh cases annually. This is down to 2.9 lakh. It’s a significant achievement for TB elimination efforts and we are confident of meeting elimination targets ahead of the national deadline of 2025. TB test coverage for HIV patients has increased from 67 pc in 2018 to 81 pc in 2019,” Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said today.Private doctors notified 6.7 lakh cases among 24.04 lakh, reporting 45 pc rise in notifications. Areas of concern are the predominant disease burden in 18 to 30-year-olds and a whopping 66,359 cases of multi-drug resistant TB in 2019. The Health Ministry says 85 per cent of them are on treatment.Another challenge is the burden of paediatric tuberculosis, which is one of the 10 major causes of mortality globally among children under 15 years. Globally, in 2018, an estimated 11 lakh children fell ill with TB and 2.5 lakh died. In India, about 3.43 lakh cases of paediatric TB are estimated to occur every year, accounting for 31 per cent of the global burden and 13 per cent of the overall TB burden in the country. The number of deaths in 2019 were 79,144.177 TB notifications per lakh populationHimachal awardedHimachal Pradesh was adjudged the third best state after Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh in TB elimination in 50 lakh-plus population category.

25-06-2020||New Delhi||Post Azhar push, Pak bid to list three Indians as terror sponsors||In its eighth term at the UN Security Council, India will have to spend its diplomatic energy on fending off attempts by Pakistan to list three Indians as designated terrorists after the US blocked its first bid to list another Indian.Last year, Pakistan had proposed the designation of four Indian nationals under the UN 1267 Sanctions List under which Masood Azhar was named as a listed terrorist. The US did not see much substance in the Pakistan proposal to target Venumadhav Dongara, an engineer, who at the time, was working on an Afghanistan project. Pakistan has now turned its attention to three others — Ajoy Mistry, Gobinda Patnaik and Angara Appaji — alleging they were using their work as engineers as a cover to provide financial, technical and material support to terrorist groups, including the TTP, Tariq Gidar Group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar.“We are disappointed that Pakistan’s proposal to designate Venumadhav Dongara as a terrorist has been objected to. Pakistan hopes that the listing requests of other three Indian nationals will be given due consideration by the UNSC 1267 Sanctions Committee in an objective and transparent manner,” read a Pakistan Foreign Office statement.“Taking advantage of the prolonged conflict in our neighbourhood, India has fomented terrorism inside Pakistan by providing training, financial and material support to terrorist groups to kill innocent people in Pakistan. These Indian nationals are now residing in India with impunity which vindicates Pakistan’s position that India is a state-sponsor of terrorism,’’ it added. Pakistan was unable to provide additional evidence to back up its accusations against Dongara, working with a RPG group company, of having orchestrated the Peshawar airbase attack last year. Pakistan began the move to accuse the four Indians in March last year, which sources say was retaliation for New Delhi’s vigorous efforts to get Jaish chief Masood Azhar listed as a designated terrorist.Getting wind of the FIR against Dongara filed in Peshawar, Indian agencies managed to ask Dongara to leave Afghanistan in order to preclude the possibility of Pakistani agencies kidnapping him. The other three Indians are also back in the country. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-azhar-push-pak-bid-to-list-three-indians-as-terror-sponsors-104015
25-06-2020||---||Amid diplomatic talks, note of rancour||New Delhi, June 24Even as Indian and Chinese diplomats today agreed to sincerely implement the understanding on disengagement and de-escalation that was reached by senior military commanders on June 6 and 22, official statements from Beijing continued to blame India for the June 15 Galwan valley clash.Interacting through video-conferencing, the 15th meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) saw India convey its concerns on the recent developments in eastern Ladakh. It was emphasised that both sides should strictly respect and observe the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Also Read:Taking place after almost a year, the meeting recalled the conversation last week between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in which they agreed to implement the June 6 understanding expeditiously.In Beijing, spokespersons of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministries again injected a note of rancour, blaming India for the June 15 clash. The Defence Ministry, in particular, gave a graphic account of events that led to the clash. Asked why he was treading old ground when ice-breaking conversations had been held subsequently, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said he wanted to clarify the situation “because the MEA in India and also Indian media have made some false reports.’’ There has been no reaction from the MEA to this allegation so far.However, both spokespersons later in their statements wound down the aggression, hoping the situation would cool down as soon as possible. Defence Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian termed China and India as “important neighbours to each other’’ and wanted both sides to make efforts to jointly ease the border situation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-diplomatic-talks-note-of-rancour-104018

Latest satellite imagery shows additional structures by the People’s Liberation Army of China have come up in the area where the deadly clash took place in the Galwan valley on June 15.Also read: Separately, sources reported movement of additional PLA troops over the past one week at the Depsang plains further north of Galwan towards the Karokaram pass, raising concern as the strategic airfield of Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) is less than 25 km from the Chinese posts.Indian Army officials in New Delhi, however, said the satellite images were yet to be verified. The officials refused to comment if it was the same spot – Patrol Point 14 — where the clash had occurred, saying it would be imprudent to comment for now.The satellite images of the Galwan valley dated June 22 put out by Twitter handle @detresfa, which has been releasing accurate images since early May, show a buildup by the PLA at the valley after the June 15 clash.Images used by the Twitter handle show possible defensive positions like walls and trenches being set up.In New Delhi, sources said the movement at Depsang plains was serious, as the PLA was close to a place called ‘Bottleneck’ from where it had a vantage position to interdict patrols of the Indian Army along Patrol Points 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13. This is the Rakki Nallah and Jeewan Nallah area where the standoff took place in 2013.Any further movement westwards by the PLA can threaten the Darbuk-Shyok-DBO (DSDBO) road and the airfield at DBO. North of DBO is the Karokaram pass and to the west of it lies Siachen.At a meeting of Lt General-level commanders of India and China on June 22, it was decided that the modalities would be worked out on the ground to disengage troops and withdraw their heavy military equipment, including fighter jets and tanks, lined up near the LAC.No immediate movement was expected as there was an element of mistrust after the Galwan valley clash.Meanwhile, Army Chief Gen M M Naravane is scheduled to visit a forward location along the LAC on Thursday, before he flies back to New Delhi. The Army Chief had visited forward areas along the LAC on Wednesday and reviewed the operational preparedness.Heightened threat for Indian ArmyOfficials tight-lippedIndian Army officials in New Delhi have said the satellite images on the buildup are yet to be verified.
