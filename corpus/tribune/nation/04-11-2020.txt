They were later freed on bail.The fresh FIR against the Bhopal Central MLA and half- a-dozen others was filed on a complaint lodged by Dharma Sanskriti Samiti functionary Dr Deepak Raghuwanshi, said Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) Bhopal range, Upendra Jain.On the complaint of Dr Deepak Raghuwanshi, the FIR under IPC section 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) was registered against Masood and six others,” he said.“Their protest has hurt the religious feelings of people, Jain said.The FIR was registered in the Talaiya police station of the city, he said.As per the complaint, Masood had gathered a large number of people and burnt an effigy of Macron and also the French flag over depictions of Prophet Mohammad,” the police officer said.The Congress MLA also warned the Central government and its ministers for supporting France over the cartoon controversy, Jain said.“Masood’s speech incited the crowd and created fear in the minds of people. His statements also have the potential to adversely affect India’s relations with France, the ADGP said.The others named in the FIR included corporator Shahwar Mansoori, he said.The anti-Macron protest, which also saw participation from Muslim clerics, was held last Thursday at Iqbal Maiden here.Last weekend, Masood and 49 others were arrested on bailable offences.

European missile maker MBDA’s Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile, Scalp cruise missile and MICA weapons system will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.The IAF is also procuring a new generation medium-range modular air-to-ground weapon system Hammer to integrate with the Rafale jets.Hammer (Highly Agile Modular Munition Extended Range) is a precision-guided missile developed by French defence major Safran.  The missile was originally designed and manufactured for the French Air Force and Navy.Meteor is the next generation of BVR air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat. The weapon has been developed by MBDA to combat common threats facing the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden.The first squadron of the Rafale jets is stationed at Ambala airbase while the second one will be based at Hasimara in West Bengal.

The Indian borders were also inaccurate in the map.Okay, finally got around to making my electoral map prediction. #2020Election #VOTE pic.twitter.com/STmDSuQTMb  Trump Jr drew flak on social media for the tweet and for showing Kashmir and the North-east states in a colour different from the rest of India.“So much for the friendship with Trump Senior. Junior has placed India firmly with @JoeBiden & @KamalaHarris though interestingly Jr. believes J&K & the NorthEast go against the rest of India & will vote Trump. Someone needs to take his colouring pencils away,” former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah tweeted.Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted, “The price of Namo’s bromance: Kashmir & the NorthEast cut off from the rest of India, & the whole “filthy” place relegated by Don Jr to the realm of hostiles, along with China & Mexico. So much for the crores spent on obsequious serenading stadium events!”Senior Fellow and Director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security Ilan Goldenberg tweeted, “I’m pretty sure Don Jr. confused Iran and India on a world map.

04-11-2020||Mumbai||ED files first chargesheet against Kochhars, Dhoot in ICICI Bank-Videocon Group PMLA case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed its first chargesheet against former ICICI Bank CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot on money laundering charges, official sources said on Wednesday.They said the chargesheet or the prosecution complaint had been filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). It was filed before a special court in Mumbai on Tuesday and the court was yet to take cognisance of it, said sources.The central probe agency had arrested Deepak Kochhar in September after it filed a criminal case of money laundering after studying an FIR registered by the CBI against the Kochhars, Dhoot and others.It slapped money laundering charges against the Kochhars and their business entities for "illegal sanctioning of loans amounting to Rs 1,875 crore to the Videocon Group of companies".The ED had earlier said an amount of Rs 64 crore, out of the loan amount of Rs 300 crore sanctioned by a committee headed by Chanda Kochhar to Videocon International Electronics Limited, was transferred to Nupower Renewables Pvt Ltd (NRPL) by Videocon Industries Limited on September 8, 2009, just a day after disbursement of loan by ICICI Bank.NRPL was earlier known as Nupower Renewables Limited (NRL) and is a company of Deepak Kochhar.The agency had alleged that the "net revenue of Rs 10.65 crore was generated by NRL from these tainted funds"."Therefore, proceeds of crime amounting to Rs 74.65 crore were transferred to or to say generated in NRPL," the ED had claimed.These facts have been mentioned in the first chargesheet filed by the agency in this case, sources said.The ED, early this year, also attached assets – including a Mumbai flat in which the couple lived, land, and plant and machinery of a windfarm project based in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra – valued at Rs 78 crore "in possession of" Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar and the companies owned and controlled by him. It had said Chanda Kochhar and her family "acquired" the Mumbai apartment, owned by one of the Videocon Group companies, by way of "acquiring that company through her family trust at a nominal price and by creating book entries".The couple has been questioned by the central probe agency multiple times in the past at its offices in Mumbai and Delhi.The CBI, in its FIR, had named Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar, Dhoot and his companies – Videocon International Electronics Ltd (VIEL) and Videocon Industries Limited (VIL). It also named Supreme Energy, a company founded by Dhoot, and Nupower Renewables, a company controlled by Deepak Kochhar, in its FIR.The CBI slapped sections of the Indian Penal Code related to criminal conspiracy, cheating and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act on all the accused.The CBI alleged that Dhoot had invested in Deepak Kochhar's company Nupower through his firm Supreme Energy, a quid pro quo to loans cleared by ICICI Bank after Chanda Kochhar took over as the CEO of the bank on May 1, 2009.The ownership of Nupower and Supreme Energy changed hands through a complex web of shared transactions between Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot, the CBI had alleged.During its preliminary enquiry, the CBI found that six loans worth Rs 1,875 crore were sanctioned to the Videocon Group and companies associated with it between June, 2009 and October, 2011 in alleged violation of laid-down policies of ICICI Bank.

04-11-2020||New Delhi||Toxic haze suffocates Delhi; unfavourable meteorological conditions to be blamed||A layer of pungent haze shrouded the national capital and smudged landmarks from view on Wednesday, as people complained of itchy throat and watery eyes.Unfavourable meteorological conditions—calm winds and low temperatures—caused the air quality to be in the “severe” category.According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 448 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 7 pm, the highest in this season so far. PM10 level below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is a particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and can get into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.The levels of PM2.5 -- finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream—were 242 µg/m3. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.“It is not even Diwali yet and the city has already become a gas chamber. This happens every year. For how long will this continue?” asked Shiv Shrivastava, a resident of south Delhi.As the skies hung heavy and acrid over the national capital, the visibility reduced to merely 600 metres at the Safdarjung Observatory. It was 800 metres at the Palam weather station.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum wind speed was 5 kilometres per hour and the minimum temperature 10.6 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.Health experts said that during the COVID-19 pandemic, air pollution has become a serious health concern for about the two crore residents of the national capital.“I can feel the pollutants in my throat despite wearing a mask. My eyes are burning. It is going to make the pandemic worse. I am scared,” said Piyush Vohra, a resident of Jangpura.According to a doctor at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, intake of every 22 micrograms per cubic metre of polluted air is equivalent to smoking a cigarette. Ajit Jain, the nodal officer for COVID-19 at Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said air pollution was turning the pandemic catastrophic.IMD officials said the situation is likely to worsen as similar weather conditions are expected over the next two days.“The wind speed slowed down suddenly after 10 am in the Delhi-NCR region due to an anti-cyclone. The temperatures have dipped alarmingly over the last few days. Unfavourable meteorological conditions trapped pollutants, resulting in a haze,” V K Soni, a senior IMD scientist, said.Delhi recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 279 at 10 am. It worsened to 386 by 7:30 pm. Several monitoring stations, including the ones at Narela (461), Wazirpur (445), Bawana (452), Jahangirpuri (454) and Rohini (444), recorded the air quality in the ‘severe’ category.The neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad and Greater Noida also recorded ‘severe’ levels of air pollution.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.However, the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor SAFAR said the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution was just five per cent on Wednesday. It was 10 per cent on Tuesday.Stubble burning accounted for 16 per cent of Delhi’s pollution on Monday and 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season.Last year, the farm fire contribution to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/toxic-haze-suffocates-delhi-unfavourable-meteorological-conditions-to-be-blamed-166026
04-11-2020||London||India will not compromise on its territorial integrity: Shringla||India will not compromise on its territorial integrity, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla has said, noting that China’s “unusual step” to “unilaterally” alter the status quo has contributed to the deterioration of the bilateral ties.Shringla, who is on a seven-day trip to Europe to review bilateral relations and discuss matters of mutual interest with key European nations, was responding to a question on the recent border tensions with China in eastern Ladakh during an interview to a German news channel.“It has contributed to deterioration in terms of the ties between our two countries because of the unusual step of China to seek to unilaterally alter the status quo,” Shringla told DW News.“You have to keep in mind that there is no common perception on the border but yet if you seek to change where the current line where troops are then of course it does impact on the larger relationship. We are concerned that China has taken this step,” he added.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated following at least three attempts by Chinese soldiers to “intimidate” Indian troops along the northern and southern bank of Pangong lake area between August 29 and September 8 where even shots were fired in the air for the first time at the LAC in 45 years.“We are very, very clear that we will stand firm and resolute in our resolve not to allow our territorial integrity or sovereignty to be compromised,” Shringla said. “We have not allowed any of this to take place. Our troops have stood resolute,” he said. “We will not compromise on our territorial integrity.”      Responding to a question on the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad - comprising Japan, India, Australia and the US, Shringla said that it is a grouping of countries which have the same vision of a free, open and transparent Indo-Pacific region and international rules-based order, international freedom navigation in global commerce and also issues such as open connectivity, respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years.Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims. In the East China Sea, China has territorial disputes with Japan.The Quad works to bolster the capacities and the abilities of the countries in the Indo Pacific within a manner that’s both constructive and cooperative, Shringla added.Asked about Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s recent comments on India, Shringla said that it was an “attempt to distract international and domestic attention from its own problems.” “I can only say that is ripe coming from the prime minister of a country that does not recognise the state of Israel, that until now does not acknowledge that the Holocaust took place, that has provided a safe sanctuary for Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar of the Taliban years after 9/11,” he said.“Considering his situation and Pakistan’s own approach towards radicalism, terrorism and issues that are important to the international community, he (Khan) really shouldn’t be making such irresponsible statements,” he added.On a question about the recent developments in Hong Kong, Shringla said, “We don’t comment on what becomes the internal affairs of states. We have said that there is a large community of Indian origin, there is a large Indian community in Hong Kong, so we are watching the situation with some level of attention and concern and we will continue to do so”.Shringla travelled to Germany from France early this week on the second leg of his three-nation European tour that also includes the UK. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-will-not-compromise-on-its-territorial-integrity-shringla-166023
04-11-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Delhi records 6,842 cases; 51 fatalities take death toll to 6,703||Delhi on Wednesday saw yet another record single-day jump in COVID-19 cases with over 6,800 confirmed infections as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the city was witnessing the “third wave” of the virus amid rising pollution levels and festive season.This is the second consecutive day when the number of daily cases in the national capital has crossed the 6000-mark. The city has been witnessing a fresh surge in coronavirus cases over the last few days.The Delhi government has also started conducting targeted COVID-19 tests in markets and other crowded areas to strengthen its surveillance mechanism.On Wednesday, 51 new fatalities pushed the toll to 6,703.The 6,842 fresh cases were detected following the 58,910 tests conducted the previous day, and the positivity rate stood at 11.61 per cent.The previous highest single-day spike of 6,725 cases was recorded on Tuesday.Delhi had recorded over 5,000 daily cases for five days on the trot ending Sunday when the count stood at 5,664. The city had recorded 4,001 COVID-19 cases on Monday.The active cases tally on Wednesday rose to 37,379 from 36,375 the previous day.The chief minister said that the city has witnessed a jump in the number of virus cases in the last few days, terming it as the “third wave”.Kejriwal, however, said that there is no need to panic as the Aam Aadmi Party government was closely monitoring the situation.He said there were adequate beds for COVID-19 patients in the city, but admitted to a shortage in ICU beds with ventilators in some private hospitals that he said would be addressed in the next one or two days.“Delhi has witnessed a jump in the number of COVID-19 cases. I think we can call it a third wave...we have been monitoring the situation continuously and there is no need to panic. We will take whatever steps are needed,” the chief minister told reporters.He said that during September end and beginning of October, the number of coronavirus cases was less than 3,000 in the city.On October 6, Kejriwal had said that Delhi is past the peak of the second wave of coronavirus and the situation has been controlled to a large extent.The AAP government’s priority is to give the best treatment and healthcare facilities to COVID-19 patients in Delhi and to keep the death rate as low as possible, Kejriwal said on Wednesday.He said that a high-level meeting has been called on Thursday to review the COVID-19 situation.Meanwhile, Health Minister Satyendar Jain said that the government has started conducting targeted COVID-19 tests in markets and other crowded areas to strengthen its surveillance mechanism.Interacting with reporters, Jain said, the current pandemic situation in the national capital, can be termed as the third wave.In a high-level meeting on Monday, chaired by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, the current COVID-19 situation was discussed threadbare.It was decided to concentrate efforts in certain key areas, such as targeted RT-PCR testing in sensitive and critical zones such as restaurants, market places, and salons; gear up the availability of medical resources including beds, ICUs, and ventilators as a preemptive measure and ensure high degree of contact tracing along with monitoring of quarantined contacts so as to suppress and break the chain of transmission, the statement said.Jain told reporters, “Targeted testing has started in market places and other densely crowded areas”.Asked if the tests will all be RT-PCR ones, he replied, RT-PCR tests will also be increased.According to a source in Delhi government’s health department, in targeted testing, samples are collected at regular intervals from a restaurant or a market place in an area reporting a high number of cases or where safety protocols may not have been adhered to diligently.As to why COVID-19 cases in Delhi are rising whereas it is showing a declining trend elsewhere, he said, “We are doing aggressive testing and contact tracing. These may be why daily cases are high. About other places, I cannot comment.”         Jain also acknowledge that he was getting reports that many people were either lax in adhering to safety norms or not wearing masks at all.On the issue of reservation of 80 per cent ICU beds in some private hospitals, the minister said, “The high court has put a stay on it, so we are going to appeal in the Supreme Court.”       Around 800 extra ICU beds would have been available otherwise, he added.Jain also said in the initial days of the pandemic, more cases were coming from congested areas.“This time, more cases are being recorded in upper-middle class and middle class segments, and they have an inclination to go to private hospitals. But treatment protocols are same in private and government hospitals. Beds are available in government facilities,” he said.The National Centre for Disease Control in a report drafted recently had warned that Delhi needs to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of COVID-19 per day taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-delhi-records-6-842-cases-51-fatalities-take-death-toll-to-6-703-166018

04-11-2020||Mumbai||Rhea’s complaint is attempt to take revenge: Rajput’s sisters||Late actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s sisters Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh on Wednesday told the Bombay High Court that the complaint lodged against them by Rhea Chakraborty for allegedly fabricating a medical prescription was an attempt to take revenge.Rhea’s complaint was based on “unfounded allegations, unsubstantiated facts, speculations and was a counterblast” to the abetment of suicide case filed against her by their father KK Singh in Bihar, the sisters said in a rejoinder in the HC.Priyanka and Meetu Singh have moved the HC seeking quashing of the case filed by Bandra police here against them for allegedly procuring a fake medical prescription for their brother a few days before he committed suicide.The rejoinder came in response to an affidavit filed by Chakraborty seeking dismissal of their petition.Chakraborty, Rajput’s girlfriend, had alleged in police complaint that Rajput’s sisters, with the help from Delhi-based Dr Tarun Kumar, forged and fabricated a medical prescription for the actor for his anxiety issues.The sisters in their rejoinder said Chakraborty lodged the FIR only “for wreaking vengeance”.“This is a classic case of malicious prosecution where the unsubstantiated and baseless allegations do not disclose commission of any offence,” it said, also seeking damages for malicious prosecution over a “concocted story”.Rajput’s father had filed a complaint in Patna, alleging that Chakraborty and her family were responsible for his son’s suicide on June 14.

04-11-2020||Satya Prakash||Right to claim maintenance must date back to filing application, rules SC||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 4 The right to claim maintenance under all enactments, including those under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), must date back to the filing of the application, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday."Financial constraints of a dependent spouse hampers their capacity to be effectively represented before the court. In order to prevent a dependent from being reduced to destitution, it is necessary that maintenance is awarded from the date on which the application for maintenance is led before the concerned court,” said a Bench headed by Justice Indu Malhotra."The delay in adjudication was not only against human rights, but also against the basic embodiment of dignity of an individual,” it said while deciding a matrimonial case from Maharashtra in which the maintenance of a wife and son under Section 125 of CrPC had to be determined.As courts adopt different judicial yardsticks to grant interim maintenance and permanent alimony in matrimonial cases, the top court also laid down guidelines to ensure uniformity and consistency in judicial practice in such matters.The guidelines issued by the top court addressed the issues of overlapping jurisdiction, payment of interim maintenance, criteria for determining the quantum of maintenance, date from which maintenance is to be awarded and enforcement/execution of orders of maintenance.On interim maintenance, it said an affidavit of disclosure of assets and liabilities annexed to the judgment should be filed by both parties in all maintenance proceedings, including pending proceedings before the concerned family courts, district courts or magistrate courts across India.For determining quantum of maintenance, the Bench said courts should consider the criteria enumerated in the judgment which were not exhaustive and the court concerned may exercise its discretion to consider any other factor/s which might be necessary or of relevance in the facts and circumstances of a case.It directed that a copy of the judgment be communicated by the SC Secretary General and to Registrars of all High Courts for onward circulation to all district courts. It shall also be displayed on websites of all subordinate courts for awareness and implementation, it said.The order or decree of maintenance may be enforced like a decree of a civil court, it noted.Dealing with the issue of overlapping, it said in cases where successive claims for maintenance were made by a party under different statutes, the court would consider an adjustment or set off the amount awarded in the previous proceeding/s while determining whether any further amount was to be awarded in the subsequent proceeding.To avoid conflicting orders in a subsequent maintenance proceeding, the applicant shall disclose the previous maintenance proceeding, and the orders passed therein, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/right-to-claim-maintenance-must-date-back-to-filing-application-rules-sc-166008
04-11-2020||Mumbai||Arguments, pleadings; high drama marks Arnab’s arrest||High drama was witnessed at the residence of Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami here on Wednesday morning when a police team arrived to arrest him in an abetment to suicide case with the entire episode, interspersed with arguments and pleadings, recorded on camera.“Arnab ji chaliye,” said a police officer, requesting the 47-year-old journalist to come along with them to Alibaug, a coastal town in Raigad district adjoining Mumbai where the case against him has been registered.The case relates to suicide by a 53-year-old interior designer in 2018, a police official said.Footage aired on Republic TV and social media platforms showed Goswami arguing with police official, alleging assault and pleading for medical aid.After sometime, as Goswami kept arguing and firing a volley of questions, police officials caught him and took him out of his Lower Parel residence in Central Mumbai and put him in a waiting van.The police officer’s “Arnab ji” address reminded people of Goswami’s jibe at the Maharashtra chief minister as Uddhav Thackeray ji on his TV shows.Mumbai Police personnel were present to assist their Raigad counterparts in completing the entire process of detention and arrest.A video showed police officers pulling Goswami out of the door of his flat and requesting him to come out. A few moments later, Goswami was seen coming inside his flat and sitting on the sofa in the hall.Family members of Goswami started recording the incident on their mobile phones and one of them was heard saying everything is live now.As a verbal altercation between police officers and Goswami ensued, one of the cops was heard telling him, better you come with us... you have to cooperate with the police.As Goswami showed reluctance, an officer introduced himself as “DySP Pravin Patil of the Raigad police”.Patil told Goswami he has come to his place in legal capacity to arrest him in case no 59/2018 registered at the Alibaug police station under IPC sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 34 (acts done by persons in furtherance of common intention).Patil also informed Goswami’s family members present in the flat that he is being taken to Alibaug, around 100 km from Mumbai.Goswami was seen alleging that he was “physically assaulted” by the police and he will not accept physical assault. I am the Editor-in-Chief of Republic TV, you are physically assaulting me, is this right?” Goswami is heard asking the police in the video.The police officials, who were present in the flat, countered Goswami and said nobody assaulted him. Goswami is seen shouting at the police and saying “Don’t touch my son, you assaulted me, you cannot assault my family. My hand is injured and I suppose to go to the hospital.”A female police officer wanted signature of Goswami’s wife on a paper. However, the well-known TV journalist immediately intervened and asked his wife not to sign on any paper and told the police to maintain physical distance.Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze, an “encounter specialist” with the Mumbai Police, was also at Goswami’s residence to assist the Raigad cops.Goswami alleged assault by Vaze and said he has illegally entered in his flat. The Republic TV Editor-in-Chief also demanded action against Vaze and DySP Patil.As the police repeatedly asked Goswami to come along them, he was heard telling them,“I want medical advice before leaving. I want to make some arrangements and I want to talk to my family.”As an officer told him that he is in police custody, Goswami sought to know what charges have been levelled against him.The officer was seen telling him,” Once again I will tell you, you are arrested by the Raigad police under sections 306, 34 of the IPC.”The officer told Goswami he has full legal right to defend himself, but for now he has to come with them. At this juncture, Goswami was seen alleging highhandedness by the police and told his wife to call the doctor.After several rounds of arguments, the police team decided to pick him up and asked him to accompany them.An officer told him, “Arnab ji chaliye” after which he was caught by police officials and pushed towards the door of the flat.At this point, Goswami in loud voice told his wife to record the entire episode.The case against Goswami relates to suicide by 53-year-old interior designer Anvay Naik in 2018.The architect and his mother committed suicide over alleged non-payment of dues by Republic TV, police said.

04-11-2020||New Delhi||SC reserves order on Skoda’s plea challenging FIR in UP over ‘cheat device’ in diesel car||The Supreme Court Wednesday reserved orders on a plea filed by Skoda Volkswagen India challenging an FIR registered in Uttar Pradesh by a customer over the use of “cheat device” in its diesel car.A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde said there are many legal procedures by which the automobile company can secure relief for itself and observed that prima facie investigation should continue in the case.“We have read the case. We are saying as to why the trial/investigation should not go on... There are many ways to deal with the criminal investigation...we know that Volkswagen is a legendary motor vehicle manufacturer, we are admirers of it... We have had the highest respect for it since World War II...but you are wrong on the stage at which you are coming here,” the bench observed.At the outset, senior advocate AM Singhvi, appearing for Skoda, told the top court that in December 2015, a complaint against Volkwagen was made in the National Green Tribunal and in March, 2019 a penalty was imposed which was stayed by the apex court.There was also this FIR lodged in UP and the company moved the high court seeking its quashing, Singhvi told the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Singhvi questioned how a fresh case can be filed when the both NGT and SC were still hearing the case.The apex court, however, said that these are two different issues.Singhvi argued that the vehicle was purchased by the complainant in 2018 and there were no complaints or representations made to the company.“In connection with the NGT matter, we had come to the SC and there was immediate stay. While the matter is pending, this FIR was lodged where the allegations are same as the application before the NGT in the earlier complaint,” Singhvi said.The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by Skoda against the Allahabad High Court order refusing to quash the FIR and dismissing its plea.The high court had said that whether a cheat device was installed in the vehicles is a matter of investigation and it cannot be interfered with by the court on an erroneous interpretation of the interim order of the Supreme Court.The top court had earlier restrained the Centre from taking any “coercive” step against it for non-submission of Rs 500 crore fine imposed by the National Green Tribunal for damaging environment through use of “cheat device” in its diesel cars in India.Earlier, a green panel bench headed by chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel had directed the car maker to deposit the amount within two months with CPCB.The tribunal had enhanced the compensation amount of Rs 171.34 crore, which was recommended by a NGT-appointed committee, to Rs 500 crore as a means of “creating deterrence”.The auto maker, however, had said that it did not violate the BS-IV norms and that the test results were based on “on road testings” for which there were no prescribed standards.A ‘cheat’ or ‘defeat device’ is software in diesel engines to manipulate emission tests by changing the performance of the cars globally.Volkswagen India had in December 2015 announced the recall of 3,23,700 lakh vehicles in India to fix the emission software after ARAI conducted tests on some models and found that their on-road emissions were 1.1 times to 2.6 times higher than the applicable BS-IV norms.The automobile giant had admitted to the use of ‘defeat device’ in 11 million diesel engine cars sold in the US, Europe and other global markets to manipulate emission test results.After the tests by ARAI, Volkswagen India had undertaken to rejig the software by recalling around 3.23 lakh vehicles fitted with EA 189 diesel engines which were in alleged violation of emission norms.The company, however, had said that the recall in India was purely voluntary in nature as it did not face any charges regarding violating emission norms in India, unlike in the US.

04-11-2020||New Delhi||No arbitrariness in selection of consultant for Central Vista project, Centre tells SC||The Centre told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that there was no arbitrariness or favouritism in selecting consultant for the Central Vista project, which covers 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens’ Delhi, and the argument that government could have adopted a better process cannot be a ground to scrap the project.Gujarat-based architecture firm HCP Designs has won the consultancy bid for the Centre’s ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista.The revamp, which was announced in September last year, envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is targeted to be constructed by August 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day. The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar that there was “no abdication of duty” in selection of consultant and every stakeholder participated and gave suggestions in the process.“An argument that the government could have adopted a better process, cannot be a sufficient ground to scrap the project,” Mehta said while opposing the pleas which have raised questions over several aspects including the environmental clearance (EC) granted to the project.“There was no element of arbitrariness or favouritism in selection of consultant,” he told the bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna.The solicitor general said the decision was taken by the competent authority and there is no allegation of “colourable exercise of power”.He said the petitioners have not shown any constitutional or statutory breach in the matter and they have only offered an alternative method, which cannot be a reason to scrap the project.The recent trend is to involve constitutional morality and due process clause from foreign countries in every case, Mehta said.“Due process is not contemplated by our Constitution,” he said. “We have our Constitution and we should not deviate from it”.Arguments in the matter remained inconclusive and would continue on Thursday.The Centre had told the apex court on Tuesday that the Central Vista project would “save money” which is paid as rent for housing central government ministries in the national capital.      The government had said that decision to have a new Parliament building has not been taken in haste and no law or norms have been violated in any manner for the project.The top court is hearing several pleas on the issue, including the one filed by activist Rajeev Suri, against various permissions given to the project by the authorities including the nod to change of land use.Earlier, the apex court had said that any change at the ground level made by authorities for the Central Vista project will be “at their own risk”.It had made it clear that the fate of the project, which includes several new government buildings and a new Parliament House, will depend on its decision.The pleas have also challenged the grant of a no-objection certificate by the Central Vista Committee (CVC) and also the environmental clearances for the construction of a new parliament house building. One of the pleas was filed against a Delhi High Court order which had said the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) was not required to apprise it before notifying changes in the Master Plan to allow the Central Vista project. The division bench of the Delhi High Court had on February 28 stayed an order of its single judge bench which had asked the DDA to approach the court before notifying any change in the Master Plan for going forth with the Centre’s ambitious project to redevelop the Central Vista. The high court’s stay order on the single judge bench’s February 11 direction had come on the intra-court appeal of the DDA and the Centre.The petitioners before the high court had opposed the Central Vista project on the ground that it involves a change in land use of the green area adjoining Rajpath and Vijay Chowk for building new Parliament and government offices. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-arbitrariness-in-selection-of-consultant-for-central-vista-project-centre-tells-sc-166000
04-11-2020||New Delhi||Toxic Air: Ambala records country's worst air quality||At a time when stubble burning is at its peak, Haryana's Ambala city recorded the most noxious air in the country on Wednesday.According to the official data, seven out of 10 most polluted cities were in Uttar Pradesh and three in Haryana.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, Ambala logged the worst air quality at 452 micrograms per cubic meter, followed by Uttar Pradesh's Moradabad at 425, Baghpat at 420, Muzaffarnagar at 412 and Haryana's Fatehabad at 406.These top most polluted cities are followed by Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad, which recorded air quality of 389 micrograms per cubic metre, Hapur at 380, Meerut at 374, Haryana's Yamunanagar at 369 and Greater Noida at 368.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences, the share of stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and other adjoining states in Delhi's air pollution was only 5 per cent for Wednesday, as against 40 per cent on Sunday. It is, however, slated to increase again due to shift in wind direction."Shift of wind direction for a limited period may bring the plume of smoke as upper wind speed is highly favourable. This may make a sudden jump in particulate pollutants for some time leading to a higher 24-hour average by Thursday. It is likely to increase the share of stubble-related intrusion by Thursday," said the ministry officials.A layer of smoky haze also lingered over Delhi-NCR on Wednesday, as air quality of the region hit 'very poor' levels at 343 micrograms per cubic metre due to contribution of stubble burning from the adjoining states and slow wind speed.Delhi's neighbouring regions – Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Noida and Greater Noida – logged 'very poor' quality of air, while Gurugram recorded 'poor' category air. Ghaziabad and Greater Noida's air quality remained the worst among all."Visibility in the region has dropped to 800m as against to 2,000m in the morning. There is a layer of pollutant in the atmosphere from the smoke emanating from stubble burning and local sources. There will be no respite for the next 2-3 days," said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department's Regional Forecasting Centre.Vijay Soni, scientist at the air pollution division of India Meteorological Department, told IANS that Punjab recorded 2,500 farm fires on Tuesday, whose smoke, combined with the low wind speed, had resulted in deterioration of air quality in the national capital and the surrounding regions."Transport of smoke caused by stubble burning in Punjab and air pollution are affecting India from north to south, even reaching the Arabian Sea," the European Union's Directorate-General for Defence Industry and Space said in a statement.

Ramasubramanian, said: “We will hear it after Diwali vacation.” Tej Bahadur had moved the top court against the Allahabad High Court which dismissed his election petition against the prime minister.The top court allowed the Centre’s plea to adjourn the hearing in the matter after Diwali vacation.After his nomination papers as the Samajwadi Party candidate in Varanasi in the 2019 polls were rejected, he had filed a special leave petition before the top court  contending that his nomination papers were rejected by the returning officer allegedly under pressure from the ruling BJP, and urged the top court to set aside the rejection.Tej Bahadur challenged the validity of the High Court judgment passed in December 2019, where the court declined to entertain his election petition saying it had no locus. It had also observed that he was neither a resident of the Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency nor a registered voter.The trooper was sacked from service after he released a video in 2017 complaining about the quality of food served to personnel of the paramilitary force. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-hear-bsf-ex-troopers-plea-against-modi-poll-win-after-diwali-165997

Can we issue a writ to such persons?” the Bench wondered.“This is infringement of my (petitioner) private life,” she said, adding directions can be issued to the Ministry of Home Affairs as there was no law to regulate this particular field.Later, Makhija chose to withdraw the PIL that also wanted the government to set up a mechanism to prevent transmission of unlawfully procured personal details of Indian citizens to foreign countries.The petitioner alleged that two private detectives who are directors of a Delhi-based company had illegally recorded and filmed her personal details without authorisation from any authority and forwarded them to a person based in the US. The US national was using those “fraudulently procured details” in a court of law there, it was alleged.The petitioner had also sought a direction to the private company not to share or transfer in public domain the illegally procured details of petitioner and also to restrain it from testifying its veracity in the Circuit court of Fairfax County, Virginia in a case filed there by a woman against her divorced husband.It wanted MHA to initiate legal action against the private firm for trespassing in the personal and intimate domain of the petitioner by impersonating its true identity and motive.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-pil-seeking-guidelines-to-regulate-private-detectives-165996
04-11-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||TRS to build office in national capital||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, November 4 Telangana’s ruling political party, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has been allotted land in Delhi to build an office. TRS is a regional party and has representation in Parliament through its MPs in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.The party announced that the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs handed over papers for the land today. The TRS has been given 1,100 square metre of land in New Delhi’s posh Vasant Vihar for the construction of the office building. This will be a party office, while Telangana and Andhra Pradesh continue to share the Bhawan building in Delhi, which also houses the state’s residential commissioner in the national capital.  The papers were received from Union Minister by Telangana’s Roads and Buildings Minister Vemula Prashant Reddy, party said in statement. The Land and Development Office of the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs had conveyed its decision to the party last month. Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR), who is also the president of the party, was told about the decision and KCR promptly responded by saying that the party would soon lay the foundation stone and complete the construction of the office building expeditiously.  TRS was floated in 2001 by KCR and other founding members with the sole objective of seeking a separating state of Telangana by bifurcation of the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh. The people of Telangana had a grouse that the region was neglected by the leaders of Andhra Pradesh.  The Congress party conceded to the demand and Telangana state came into being in 2014 with KCR as its first chief minister. Till recently, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh shared the capital Hyderabad and Andhra Pradesh had many offices running from the capital city. After the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) came to power at the end of 2019, it decided to vacate most offices in the city, including the secretariat building.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trs-to-build-office-in-national-capital-165995

04-11-2020||New Delhi||Targeted COVID-19 testing begins in market places, crowded areas in Delhi: Jain||The Delhi government has started conducting targeted COVID-19 tests in markets and other crowded areas to strengthen its surveillance mechanism, the city’s Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Wednesday amid a surge in daily coronavirus cases in the national capital in the last few days.Delhi recorded over 6,700 fresh COVID-19 cases for the first time on Tuesday taking the infection tally in the national capital to over four lakh, while the positivity rate was recorded at 11.29 per cent amid festive season and rise in pollution levels.Interacting with reporters, Jain said the current pandemic situation in the national capital can be termed as its “third wave”.In a high-level meeting on Monday, chaired by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, the current COVID-19 situation was discussed threadbare.It was decided to concentrate efforts in certain key areas, such as targeted RT-PCR testing in sensitive and critical zones such as restaurants, market places, barber shops and salons; gear up the availability of medical resources including beds, ICUs, and ventilators as a preemptive measure and ensure high degree of contact tracing along with monitoring of quarantined contacts so as to suppress and break the chain of transmission, the statement said.Jain told reporters, “Targeted testing has started in market places and other densely crowded areas”. Asked if there theses tests will be all RT-PCR ones, he replied RT-PCR tests will also be increased.According to a source in Delhi government’s health department, in targeted testing, samples are collected at regular intervals from a restaurant or a market place in an area from where high number of cases is getting recorded or where safety protocols may not have been adhered to diligently.As to why COVID-19 cases in Delhi are rising whereas it is showing a declining trend elsewhere, he said, “We are doing aggressive testing and contact tracing. These may be why daily cases are high. About other places, I cannot comment.”                Jain also acknowledged that he was getting reports that many people were either lax in adhering to safety norms or not wearing masks at all.On the issue of reservation of 80 per cent ICU beds in some private hospitals, the minister said, “The high court has put a stay on it, so we are going to appeal in the Supreme Court.” Around 800 extra ICU beds would have been available otherwise, he added.Jain also said in the initial days of the pandemic, more cases were coming from congested areas.“This time, more cases are being recorded in upper-middle class and middle class segments, and they have an inclination to go to private hospitals. But treatment protocols are same in private and government hospitals. Beds are available in government facilities,” he said.According to experts, if a person removes his facemask in a public place and the prescribed distance of two metre is not followed, then transmissibility of coronavirus increases.But the safe distance of two metre is difficult to maintain in market areas especially during the festive season, they said.Delhi had recorded over 5,000 daily cases for five days on the trot, ending Sunday when the count stood at 5,664. The number of containment zones in Delhi increased to 3,453 on Tuesday from 3,416 the previous day.The sudden spike in cases comes amid festive season and rising pollution level. While Durga Puja celebrations ended on October 25, the next major festivals are Diwali and Chhath in November.The National Centre for Disease Control in a report drafted recently had warned that Delhi needs to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of COVID-19 per day taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/targeted-covid-19-testing-begins-in-market-places-crowded-areas-in-delhi-jain-165969

Law and order is a state subject. The removal of the rail blockade for the smooth passage of passenger and goods trains is in the interest of everyone. For winters, we have to move LPG cylinders and clothing for forces deployed in forward areas,” Javadekar said responding to a question relating to Punjab Chief Minister’s dharna here.Javadekar also wondered whether the agitation was “political in nature and in support of commission agents” as farmers had benefitted by selling their produce at a higher MSP rate.Farmers in Punjab have been protesting against the Centre’s three farm reform laws, which began around September 24, as they expressed apprehension that the new legislations would pave the way for dismantling of the MSP system, leaving them at the “mercy” of capital intensive corporate houses.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-governments-inaction-led-to-rail-blockade-in-state-prakash-javadekar-165964

We are not against the growth of the country but don’t you think that the distance of 22 km of a mine from the eco-sensitive zone is dangerously close to the forest”.Venugopal said that if that is the case, then in Goa, the mining will not be possible, if this distance parameter is adhered so strictly.Senior advocate AM Singhvi, also appearing for Jharkhand, said that the distance from the eco-sensitive zone in the animal corridor was held to be 19 kilometre by the top court and area outside the protected area is as important as the protected area.Singhvi said that in the present case all the seven areas in question are the eco-sensitive areas and suggested that the expert panel will not take much time. Venugopal said that if the top court is going to stay the auctioning throughout the country then the Centre needs to argue in the matter.         “Then we will stay the e-auction at other places also if it’s brought to our notice that they are close enough to the mining areas,” the bench said adding, “any proposed mining block near the 50 Km radius will not be e auctioned”.   Venugopal opposing the suggestion of the court said that the Jharkhand was asking for more revenue share in the writ petition and the eco-sensitive issue and the elephant corridor was never argued. “Please grant me one day time to show that the stopping of mining will cause irreparable damage,” Venugopal said. The bench said it would keep the matter pending and grant time to AG to bring more facts related to the Jharkhand’s plea and other aspects. It posted the matter for further hearing on November 6 and till then intervenors will have to wait with their plea.On September 30, the top court had observed that if an area falls under eco sensitive zone then neither the Centre nor the state government will have the right to mine it.It had said that prima facie central government is entitled to auction the coal blocks in the state but to find out if the areas in question are eco-sensitive or not, it may send some experts.Jharkhand had earlier sought postponing of e-auction of coal block for commercial mining in the state till its suit under Article 131 is decided by the top court.Referring to the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution, which deals with administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes, state’s plea had said that six of the nine coal blocks in Jharkhand - Chakla, Chitarpur, North Dhadu, Rajhara North, Seregarha and Urma Paharitola—which have been put up for auction fall within the Fifth Schedule. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/e-auction-of-mining-near-50-km-radius-of-eco-sensitive-zone-may-not-be-allowed-says-sc-165956

We don't know any political party or persons. What we want is justice for my deceased father," she said.Meanwhile, Akshata Naik said they are grateful to the Maharashtra Police for taking action against Goswami."Maharashtra police are well capable to investigate this case. My husband had mentioned names of three persons including Arnab Goswami in his suicide note but no arrest was made then. He committed suicide only because his legitimate dues were not paid by the accused persons," she said.Police had said that in a suicide note, Anvay Naik, who owned Concorde Designs Pvt Ltd, had claimed that he was ending his life due to non-payment of his dues by Goswami, Feroz Shaikh of IcastX/Skimedia and Niteish Sarda of Smartworks.Police said that as per the note, the three firms owed Naik's company Rs 83 lakh, Rs four crore and Rs 55 lakh respectively.In May this year, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh announced he has ordered a fresh probe in the case after a complaint by Adnya Naik.

He is scheduled to meet Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli on Friday. India's decision to send the Army chief to Nepal to reset the ties is seen as part of a larger exercise by New Delhi to rejuvenate relations with Myanmar, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan in the wake of greater efforts by China to expand its influence in the region.The ties between the two countries came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory. Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories.After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a "unilateral act" and cautioning Kathmandu that such "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it.In June, Nepal's Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring areas which India maintains belong to it.India termed as untenable the "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims by the neighbouring country.India said Nepal's action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks.Nepal Prime Minister Oli has been asserting that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to Nepal and vowed to "reclaim" them from India.The Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India.Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory - India as part of Uttarakhand's Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Dharchula district.

04-11-2020||Chandigarh||As winter commitments spike, BRO seeks dedicated ice-cutters for high altitude areas||As its winter commitments spike amidst unprecedented troop deployment in high altitude areas, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is looking at the procurement of tracked ice-cutters for enhancing the efficacy of snow clearance operations to ensure vital lines of communication remain free of hazards.The BRO, at present, is using snow blowers along with bulldozers, that are used for road construction activities.While snow blowers are used for clearing soft snow, bulldozers, both tracked and wheeled, are used for removing soft as well as solidified snow, but these have limitations in clearing ice as a gap remains between the blade and the road surface or the road gets damaged, BRO sources said.Wide dozer blades, according to a BRO officer, are meant to dig up or scrape the rough ground and moving loose earth and are not designed for use on paved surfaces like roads."We have projected the requirement for dedicated equipment, that can break up ice and solidified snow and then blow it aside without damaging the road surface", he added.Dozers are okay for clearing landslides, but snow clearance along lengthy road stretches require a different approach.With heavy deployment and increased movement of vehicles, BRO’s commitments in winters will also go up substantially, when areas in Ladakh and the north-east experience frequent and heavy snow. Environmental conditions, as well as constant traffic over the same place, results in snow turning into ice, movement over which become dangerous.“Due to the ongoing stand-off with China, many smaller roads and tracks in the vicinity of the Line of Actual Control that otherwise remained closed in winters will also have to be kept serviceable,” said a senior BRO officer. This would require constant repositioning of resources along with functional support from locally deployed troops.Operational plans have been drawn up to meet the requirements and also to cater for any exigencies.BRO is responsible for the construction and maintenance of road communication lines in border areas of the country.In spring this year, BRO had opened up the road link to Ladakh along the Manali-Leh, Srinagar-Leh and Darcha-Padam axis, which remains closed for several months in winters due to snow, several weeks ahead of schedule.Works in border areas were stepped up after the stand-off with the Chinese unfolded.A large number of bridges along vital routes were also inaugurated recently and more roads and bridges are expected to be complete shortly.The BRO’s budget, which was Rs 5,400 crore in 2017-18, had spiked to Rs 11,000 crore in 2020-21, which also includes a hike in the allocation for procurement of equipment from domestic and foreign sources.China also has a well-developed border infrastructure on its side.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-winter-commitments-spike-bro-seeks-dedicated-ice-cutters-for-high-altitude-areas-165940
04-11-2020||Mumbai||Give copy of plea over Disha Salian's death to Maharashtra govt: HC||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday asked an advocate to serve to the Maharashtra government a copy of his petition that seeks court-monitored CBI probe into the death of Disha Salian, former manager of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput.The petition filed by advocate Puneet Dhanda claimed that the deaths of Disha Salian and Rajput are interconnected as they occurred under suspicious circumstances.When the plea was taken up for hearing on Wednesday by a division bench of Justices K K Tated and G S Kulkarni, the petitioner's advocate Vineet Dhanda told the court that Salian had died on June 8 and Rajput on June 14."The Mumbai police has not done their work and not carried out a proper inquiry into the deaths. The case (both the deaths) has created hue and cry in the country," Vineet Dhanda argued.The bench was, however, informed by the additional government pleader that the state has not been served a copy of the petition.Dhanda then claimed that he has already served a copy but will do so again."You (petitioner) file an affidavit of service and also give them (government) another copy," the bench said and posted the plea for further hearing on November 26.The petitioner, Puneet Dhanda, approached the Bombay High Court after the Supreme Court refused to hear the plea and directed them to approach the high court first.Salian, 28, died on June 8, 2020, after falling off the 14th floor of a residential building in suburban Malad.Rajput, aged 34, was found hanging from the ceiling of his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14.While the Mumbai police had initially registered an Additional Death Report (ADR) case in Rajput's death, the probe was later handed over to CBI after his father KK Singh filed a case in Bihar accusing the actor's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and her family of abetting his suicide and cheating him.

04-11-2020||New Delhi||Arnab's arrest: Cong slams BJP for 'selective outrage', says law will take own course||Hitting out at the BJP over its criticism of Arnab Goswami's arrest in Mumbai, the Congress on Wednesday said its "selective outrage" on press freedom is "shameful" and the law will take its own course in the case against the Republic TV editor-in-chief.Goswami was arrested from his residence in Mumbai on Wednesday for allegedly abetting the suicide of a 53-year-old interior designer.Several Union ministers and senior BJP leaders have criticised the Congress over Goswami's arrest and called it an "attack on freedom of press". The Congress is part of the Shiv Sena-led coalition government in Maharashtra.Asked about Goswami's arrest and the BJP's criticism of it, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said she was “actually very shocked with the selective outrage of the BJP of the sections of the government”. “Why are they silent when Prashant Kanojia is jailed for a number of months just because he exposed a scam where children were being served salt and chapati in Mirzapur?" the spokesperson asked, referring to the journalist who was arrested by the UP Police.Addressing a media briefing, she raised several other questions.Why, she asked, is the BJP "selectively silent" when sedition charges are slapped against journalists and when a case has been filed against (Scroll) journalist Supriya Sharma because she exposed the pathetic state of affairs in a village in Varanasi. “And when a reporter who exposed the PPE kit scam in Uttar Pradesh is jailed and faces serious sedition charges instead of action been taken against those responsible for the scam,” she added."So this selective outrage is extremely unwarranted, is shameful and they (the BJP) should be ashamed of saying anything," she told reporters.Shrinate also hit out at Goswami, saying she herself had been a journalist for almost two decades and alleged that he had brought complete "disgrace and shame" to journalism.                "What he does in the garb of journalism is not journalism, what he does in the garb of journalism is the work of a BJP frontal," Shrinate said."To accuse people, to hurl abuses, to make any sort of allegations, to use the language that he does. Is he judge or jury? What sort of journalism is he doing in the garb of running a TV channel," she said.Shrinate said the BJP should be the last one to be talking about freedom of the press.     She also accused the BJP of controlling the media through advertisements and through "intimidation and fear"."I am reasonably certain that wherever Congress is in government or we are in alliance, people will not be punished if they are absolutely innocent.  I also believe that law will take its own course even in this case," she said.The Congress believes in the independence of institutions and has never compromised their independence or autonomy, Shrinate said.Goswami, who was seen being pushed into a police van, claimed he was assaulted by police at his home.BJP president J P Nadda and various senior Union ministers, including Amit Shah, slammed Goswami's arrest, describing it as a "blatant misuse of state power" and reminiscent  of the Emergency.

04-11-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Military proposes pension cut, increase in retirement age of armed forces officers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 4In a path-breaking move, the Department of Military Affairs has initiated a twin-move: one to ‘review’--cut down--the pension for those officers opting for premature retirement and the second to increase the retirement age  of officers  of the Indian armed forces.The issue has come under severe criticism as the pension formula will change in a manner which could impact the financial position of those retiring now. A senior lawyer, who deals in the subject of military law, said “the DMA has no locus standi to alter pension formula and it will be challenged in court”.The DMA, headed by General Bipin Rawat, is the newly created entity under the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and is tasked for HR and coordination issues   between the Army, Navy and the Indian Air Force (IAF).A letter sent out by the DMA office on October 29 says a draft of the Government Sanction Letter (GSL) is being readied by November  10 for review by General Rawat, who is the Secretary of the DMA and also the Chief of Defence Staff.This letter proposes to increase the retirement age of Colonels, Brigadiers  and Maj Generals to 57 years, 58 years and  59 years, respectively. The same will apply   to officers of similar ranks in the Navy and the IAF. The existing retirement age for Colonels, Brigadiers and Maj Generals is 54 years, 56 years and 58 years, respectively.The core issue is the pension formula which is now suggested to be in a format that increases the emoluments with years of service.As per the proposal, an officer with 20-25 years of service will get 50 per cent   of ‘entitled pension’. The existing entitled  pension is 50 per cent of the last pay drawn. In other words the pension will be halved.An officer serving for 26-30 years would get 60 per cent of entitled  pension; those doing 30-35 years of service will get 75 per cent of entitled pension. Only those  who do more than 35 years of service will be entitled for full pension, that is 50 per cent of the last pay drawn.A functionary pointed out that, only those who get commissioned by 22 years of age will be eligible  for full pension after serving for 35 years as they could retire at Colonel’s at 57 years of age.There has been an ongoing debate on rising pension bill of the MoD since the ‘One rank, one pension’ was implemented. In the ongoing fiscal ending March 31, 2021, the pension bill stands at Rs 1,33,819 crore, which is 28 per cent of the overall budget of the MoD at Rs 4,71,372 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/military-proposes-pension-cut-increase-in-retirement-age-of-armed-forces-officers-165910

Poll experts said that the turnout is going to be the key in the election results. The mail-in ballots could take days or weeks to be counted in some states, meaning a winner might not be declared in the hours after polls close on Tuesday.There is an estimated four million Indian-American population of which about 2.5 million are potential voters in the November 2020 presidential elections. Over 1.3 million Indian-Americans are voters in key battleground states, including Texas, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania.Large lines were seen and hundreds of people had queued up before polling stations, particularly in the key battleground states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Trump in the wee hours of Tuesday urged Americans to vote for him. “Vote like your freedom, your livelihood, and our future depends on it… Because they do!” tweeted Trump, who is seeking to avoid becoming the first incumbent President to lose a re-election since George HW Bush in 1992.Biden also tweeted urging people to vote: “It’s election day. Go vote, America!” National polls continue to show Biden leading Trump, by a comfortable 8 percentage points. US elections, however, are not determined by the national popular vote, but rather in the 538-member Electoral College, with each candidate needing a majority of 270 to win the presidency.The Covid pandemic was a major topic during the election.
