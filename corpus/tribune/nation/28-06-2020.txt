28-06-2020||New Delhi||Congress demands that locust attacks be declared ‘natural disaster’||The Congress on Sunday demanded that the government should declare locust attacks a natural disaster and farmers be given compensation under the crop insurance scheme.The demand came after swarms of crop-destroying locusts entered Gurgaon in Haryana, border areas of the national capital and over half a dozen districts in Uttar Pradesh, prompting state authorities to sound an alert.The Centre had said it has deputed more teams to assist in control operations.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala claimed that the farmers and the general public are being told to bang ‘Taali and Thali (claps and plates)’ when there is a locust attack.“Sometimes the useless government prescribes ‘taali-thaali’ solution for the coronavirus pandemic, while at other times it prescribes it to deal with the locust attacks,” Surjewala said in a statement.“Is there no other scientific and rational solution left with the government?” he asked.Locust swarms have attacked crops in Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and western Uttar Pradesh.  Now these attacks have reached Delhi, he said.Farmers from more than 84 districts of these states have been badly affected by the attack of locusts from Pakistan, Surjewala said.“Today, more than 10 lakh hectare of farm land has been affected by locust swarms, but no relief has been provided to farmers,” he said. Rahul Gandhi had warned the government about the issue, but like on coronavirus, the government did not act, the Congress’ chief spokesperson alleged.Insurance companies are refusing to compensate the farmers for the losses suffered by the locusts under the crop insurance scheme because Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not include the locust swarm attack in the definition of “natural disaster”, Surjewala said.The Congress demands that compensation to farmers be paid under the crop insurance scheme by including locust attack in the definition of “natural disaster” by the Department of Agriculture and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Surjewala said.A special relief package should be given to all farmers after special ‘girdawari’ (survey) of the destroyed crops, he said.Surjewala said a scientific and rational solution must be found to the locust attacks happening since more than 75 days on agricultural lands, trees and plants.

28-06-2020||Chennai||Not even hurtful language allowed, says city police chief on arrest guidelines||Guidelines laid down for police on handling arrests or accused persons include not even using hurtful language against them, while beating them up was “unlawful,” City Police Commissioner AK Viswanathan said on Sunday.His comments, made in response to scribes’ queries here on the standard procedure in this connection, come in the backdrop of a national furore over the death of a father-son duo in a hospital in Tuticorin recently after they were allegedly thrashed while in police custody earlier.Popular Tamil cinema director G Hari, known for his blockbuster cop stories like ‘Saamy,’ expressed concern over the Tuticorin deaths and ‘regretted’ his glorifying the police in five of his action flicks.Viswanathan, speaking to reporters here, said there are a number of guidelines, besides Supreme Court directions, vis-a-vis arrests.“Assault and torture (of the arrested) should not be done. As far as the Greater Chennai Police or the state police is concerned, we have reiterated that even language that could hurt someone should not be used,” he said.“Beating up is wrong, unlawful. We have been insisting this to all officials, personnel and police stations,” he added.P Jayaraj and his son Fennix, arrested for ‘violating’ lockdown norms over business hours of their cellphone shop, died at a hospital in Kovilpatti on June 23, with the relatives alleging that they were severely thrashed at the Sathankulam police station by police personnel earlier.The incident had triggered a furore in the state, leading to the suspension of four policemen, including two sub-inspectors.Civil society members and activists, political parties and celebrities have demanded justice for the death of the father-son duo.Meanwhile, director Hari expressed concern over the Tuticorin deaths.He said a Sathankulam-like incident should not recur and said highest punishment for the culprits alone would ensure this.“The excesses of a few personnel in the department have maligned the entire force. I really regret making five films glorifying the police,” he said in the statement.Known for his fast-paced action thrillers, Hari had churned out blockbuster cop stories ‘Singam’ and ‘Saamy,’ starring Surya and Vikram respectively in titular roles, following them up with sequels.Meanwhile, Makkal Needhi Maiam founder-president Kamal Haasan also sought justice for the father-son duo.In a statement, he said while financial assistance announced by the government was needed, however, the government should not stop with it.He called for a detailed probe into the matter, saying all concerned should be punished for their role in the incident.Meanwhile, a constable attached with the city police has been suspended pending enquiry following a social media post in connection with the Sathankulam incident.“The post maligns the police department,” sources said.When enquired, the policeman revealed he had shared his Facebook account password with his friends and that someone had written the post of which he was not aware of.He has been since suspended for bringing disrepute to the police department and an enquiry has been ordered, police sources said.

28-06-2020||New Delhi||Vande Bharat Mission phase 4: IndiGo, AI & GoAir to operate flights between July 3-15||Air India will fly 114 flights while IndiGo and GoAir will operate 457 and 41 flights respectively between July 3 and July 15 under the fourth phase of the Vande Bharat Mission.The government started the mega mission to evacuate stranded Indians from abroad on May 6. Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Under the fourth phase of the mission, Air India will operate 114 flights to India from 17 countries, Canada, the US, the UK, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Kyrgyzstan, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Thailand, South Africa, Russia, Australia, Myanmar, Japan, Ukraine and Vietnam, according to the airline’s document accessed by PTI.Air India’s chartered flights are scheduled to be operated between July 3 and 15, the aforementioned official document stated.It said the airline would fly 31 flights from the US and 19 flights from the UK. Earlier, a previous document of Air India had said it would operate a total of 170 flights to and from 17 countries.Private airlines like IndiGo and GoAir will also play a major role in the fourth phase of the mission.In a tweet on Sunday evening, the Civil Aviation Ministry said: “Private Airlines will have significant participation in Phase-4 of VBM. Among others, IndiGo will operate 238 flights from Qatar & 219 flights from Kuwait; while GoAir will operate 41 flights from Kuwait. A number of private carriers, flights & destinations likely to increase.”Air India is scheduled to operate 272 chartered flights to and from various countries in the third phase, which began on June 10 and will end on July 4.The first phase started from May 7 and commenced on May 16.The US Department of Transportation announced on June 22 that it has barred Air India from operating chartered flights between India and the United States from July 22 without its prior approval, in apparent retaliation to the Indian government for not allowing American carriers to operate between the two countries.On June 23, the Aviation Ministry said that it was considering establishing “individual bilateral bubbles” with the US, the UK, Germany and France, allowing airlines of each country in the pact to operate international passenger flights.After nearly two months of suspension to combat the coronavirus outbreak, the government resumed scheduled domestic passenger flights from May 25 but in a curtailed manner and by placing lower and upper limits on airfares depending upon the flight duration.Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on June 20 said the government would start thinking on resuming scheduled international passenger flights in mid-July when it expected the domestic air traffic to reach 50 to 55 per cent of the levels before COVID-19.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said last Friday that it was extending the suspension of scheduled international passenger flights in the country till July 15 but added that some international scheduled services on selected routes may be permitted on a case-to-case basis.

28-06-2020||New Delhi||IP University to lead project to develop low-cost test for detecting COVID-19 antibodies||The Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University will lead a project to develop a low-cost test for rapid detection of COVID-19 antibodies, a statement from the university said on Sunday.The translational project of Rs 98 lakh was submitted to BIRAC-DBT by Dr Gaurav Pandey of the University School of Biotechnology (USBT). It has been selected for funding in response to a research consortium call on COVID -19, the statement added.“It is a matter for pride that IP University will lead a multi-institutional project to develop the indigenous technology for rapid detection of COVID -19 antibodies with minimum infrastructural requirement,” it said.The Biotechnology Industry Research Council (BIRAC), a public sector enterprise set up by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) through its COVID -19 research consortium after competitive evaluation, will fund the university and its partners to develop a low-cost completely indigenous test for SARS COV2 antibody testing, which can be used for large scale screening of pandemic population, it said.Currently most of these antibody tests either as complete tests or with some of key components such as antigens rely on imports, it said.Dr Gaurav Pandey from IP University, Dr Anurag Rathore from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi and Mr Prateek Mittal from Medsource Ozone form a translational team which will “develop a scalable process to produce the required antigens components and manufacture the point of care lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) device”.The LFIA test provides the results in maximum 15-20 minutes and is almost resource independent, the statement said.“It doesn’t require high-end equipment and can be used in remote settings. The partnership with an industrial partner Medsource Ozone Pvt. Ltd will ensure faster diffusion of technology, manufacturing and commercialization,” it added.

28-06-2020||New Delhi||DGCA issues show-cause notice to AirAsia India executive after pilot alleges safety violations||The aviation regulator DGCA has issued a show-cause notice to a top executive of AirAsia India two weeks after one of its pilots, who runs a popular YouTube channel called Flying Beast, alleged violations of safety norms by the low-cost airline, senior officials said on Sunday.“A show-cause notice has been issued to Manish Uppal, Head of Operations, AirAsia India after the pilot’s allegations,” the DGCA officials said.An AirAsia India spokesperson said, “AirAsia India confirms receipt of the notice and we are assisting the regulator in its fact finding process. We will fully cooperate with the regulator.”Captain Gaurav Taneja, a popular Youtuber, tweeted on June 14 that he has been suspended by AirAsia India “for standing up for safe operations of an aircraft and its passengers”.On June 15, he posted a detailed video on YouTube titled “Reasons behind suspension from my pilot job”.Taneja alleged in the video that the airline has asked its pilots to do 98 per cent of landings in “Flap 3” mode, which allows it to save fuel. He said if a pilot does not do 98 per cent of landings in “Flap 3” mode, the airline considers it a violation of its standard operating procedure (SOP).Flaps are part of wings of an aircraft and they are engaged to create a drag during a landing or a take-off.Taneja gave the example of the Imphal airport, where the plane descends more steeply as compared to other airports when approaching for landing. He said when an aircraft is coming down steeply, it needs to have a drag so that it remains slow, and in these circumstances a pilot has to do a “Flap full” landing.“In order to achieve targets, what would people do? They will do Flap 3 landings without giving consideration whether it is safe or unsafe. This directly impacts the passenger safety,” he said in his YouTube video.If something happens during a Flap 3 landing, then the question would be asked to the pilot if he or she cares more about saving fuel or 180 passengers’ lives, Taneja said.On June 15, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said on Twitter that it had taken note of the concerns raised by some stakeholders “against a particular airline and its approach to safety”.“DGCA has already started an investigation into the issues flagged and shall take appropriate action based on the outcome of the said investigation,” it added.Senior DGCA officials had confirmed on June 15 itself that AirAsia India was under investigation after Taneja’s allegations.

28-06-2020||Yash Goyal||Rajasthan CM demands PM to clarify actual status on LAC||Our CorrespondentJaipur, June 28Assailing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement of ‘no intrusion inside the Indian territory nor any post of the Indian Army captured’, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday demanded that the NDA government should clarify the actual and the current status of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on India-China border.“The Government of China and its media has hailed and taken up Modi’s statement of ‘no intrusion into the Indian territory nor any post of the Indian Army capture’ as a ‘certificate given by the Prime Minister inadvertently,” Gehlot said during an official video-conference here.“It was not required for the PM to make such a statement. He has made a blunder. He should withdraw this statement and clarify the present status of the LAC and tell how many Indian and Chinese soldiers were killed and how many got injured,” Gehlot stressed.The public wanted to know from the NDA-led Prime Minister what was going and if there was any intrusion or seizure of any Indian post, Gehlot said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi should have a moral responsibility to take the nation in his confidence as the entire Opposition parties had shown their solidarity with the unity and integrity of the nation, the Chief Minister urged.“Because of India’s deteriorating economic condition due to COVID-19, China had done this cruel act on the Indian soldiers, and it should be analysed by the Central Government’s MEA,” Gehlot commented.Gehlot added that whosoever was the BJP president, his relations with China were very comfortable and Narendra Modi had been frequently going to China and meeting its President in India as well.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has had meetings with the Chinese President 18 times and when he was the Chief Minister, he had visited China four times,” Gehlot counted.When China had a huge market and business in India, why such brutal attacks happened on the LAC, Gehlot added.When asked about US President Donald Trump’s support to Modi this issue, Gehlot said: “It was good to speak or lecture and make friends all over the World, but ‘Aaj PM ki pole khul rahi hai... America Kya kar raha hai aap ke saath, Decemeber mein kya karega sabko maloom hai’”.The Prime Minister should not blame the Opposition parties for the action he was taking to run the government and dealing with the international borders, he said, adding that Narendra Modi should also reply to Rahul Gandhi’s question which he raised on the same issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-cm-demands-pm-to-clarify-actual-status-on-lac-105773

28-06-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||India’s tango with Russia to dissuade China||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 28When Defence Minister Rajnath Singh accompanied by top Ministry bureaucrats landed in Moscow at short notice following the Galwan Valley clash, it was not just the quest of arms that saw them overlooking new-found friends the US and Israel.One aspect of their dash to Russia was to tap the Kremlin’s Asia-Pacific policy of binding itself in consultative and cooperative arrangements with both China and India. This diplomatic positioning places the Kremlin as the best bet to lower immediate tensions with China; the retaliation can then take place at a time and place of New Delhi’s choosing.Hence, the RIC format came in handy for foreign ministers of the three countries to look beyond the immediate dissonance by the deaths of Indian soldiers. The format also became a forum for Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to announce RIC’s expansion to include interactions between the Defence Ministers as well as a continuation of the past practice of holding a leaders’ RIC involving Modi, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the next G-20 summit.But arms and weapons are a transactional relationship and a bottomless pit for the recipient nation, in this case, India. In order to ensure that Russia stays with India and the taxpayer also reaps visible benefits, India will have to seize the opportunities in the Arctic and the Far East.Always wary of looking for a challenge from China, India, in this case, need not look over its shoulder. The signals emanating from Moscow are that it would prefer India and Japan as its partners for the quest in both these geographically vast, climatically forbidding and largely untapped region studded with natural resources such as oil and gas, timber and coke.Although India’s interest in Russia’s wilds precedes the current crises with China, this may be time to accelerate the policy on the basis of leverages provided by New Delhi. India has extended a $1 billion line of credit for the development of the Russian Far East. Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, several of his Ministers and Chief Ministers have braved six time zones to signal India’s interest by visiting Vladivostok, called the San Francisco of Russia.Lavrov is already on record as having stated that Russia wants India to be the first non-Arctic state to mine resources from the region. Implicit is the indication that China, which along with India, joined the Arctic Council as an Observer in 2013, will be kept out.India also needs to reach out to Norway where it has its sole permanent research station for the Arctic in order to avoid getting caught in the West versus Russia cross-fire which is inevitable as resource exploitation of the Arctic gets into high gear.A stronger Indian foothold in availing of natural gas, oil, timber, diamond and high-quality coal from the Far East and the Arctic will mean more ships passing through South China Sea and the Malacca Straits. While Russia sells sea-denial and air-denial military hardware to India to keep China at bay, its stake in shipments to India will ensure that the Kremlin will always be at hand to cool tensions if the Sino-Indian rivalry gets out of hand.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-tango-with-russia-to-dissuade-china-105758
28-06-2020||New Delhi||No storm can continue forever: Vice President Naidu on COVID-19 pandemic||Asserting that the COVID-19 pandemic cannot continue forever, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday urged people to take all precautions to keep the killer virus at bay as the country emerged from the nationwide lockdown and entered the “unlock” phase.In a Facebook post, he appealed to the people to stay calm and have a firm belief that “no storm can continue forever.”Naidu noted that most of the countries have ended the lockdowns and had started focusing on the economy.He said the government was taking continuous measures to boost the economy and asked everyone to support it by taking necessary precautions and following the guidelines. He advised people not to press the “panic button” but reach out for the “prevention and protection buttons”.Calling upon the people to collectively fight against this unprecedented health crisis, the Vice President said India’s strength was rooted in its faith in spirituality and trust in science.Maintaining that the solution to COVID-19 lay in precautions, the Vice President M Venkaiah listed simple steps such as the use of face masks, practising safe distancing and washing of hands frequently as the only known ways of staying safe.Along with these steps, he also suggested the use of traditional foods, herbal and medicinal plant preparations that have proved to be great immunity boosters.Asking people to stay connected with family and friends, he wrote that technology could help them enjoy the feeling of togetherness.Cautioning people not to get carried away by sensational news or “panic-inducing” social media posts, Naidu asked them to refrain from forwarding unfounded and unverified messages.The vice president also opined that there could not be an easy or definitive answer to questions such as ‘how long will the restricted lifestyle last and when will we return to our normal lifestyle?’“We have to probably live with both the uncertainty of the duration of the pandemic and the stress it has induced,” he said.

28-06-2020||---||WB could not be made beneficiary of migrants’ job scheme as TMC govt didn’t give data: Sitharaman||Kolkata, June 28Criticising the TMC dispensation in West Bengal for allegedly opposing pro-people policies of the Centre, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday said the state could not be made a beneficiary of the ‘Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan’, as it had not provided any data on migrant labourers.Addressing a virtual rally for the people of Bengal, the Union finance minister also slammed Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for “her reluctance to allow Shramik Special train services in the state”.“The West Bengal government has been opposing all pro-people policies of the Centre...Six states have shared data on migrant workers, following their return. West Bengal, however, did not,” she said. “Our prime minister launched a scheme, which covers 116 districts in the country, but none from Bengal could be included as the TMC government didn’t bother to share any data with us. The ruling dispensation in Bengal doesn’t want any of the Centre’s welfare policies to be implemented,” Sitharaman said.Senior TMC leaders had recently criticised the Union government for not making the state a beneficiary in the ‘Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan’, a job scheme for migrant labourers.Sitharaman, however, appreciated the chief minister for her support to the central government on the issue of the Sino-India border standoff.“I would credit her for one thing; at least on the Sino-India border issue, she (Mamata Banerjee) stood by the Centre,” Sitharaman said.Terming the TMC government as “anti-people”, Sitharaman said the state was informed about cyclone ‘Amphan’, 11 days in advance, but it failed to take adequate precaution.Several lives could have been saved, if timely measures were taken, she said.On West Bengal’s alleged unwillingness to bring back migrant labourers, Sitharaman said it was the only state that was not keen on taking back its workers.“The migrant labourers would never forget the treatment you (Mamata Banerjee) have meted out to them. She (Mamata) had said that these special migrant trains were bringing more coronavirus cases to the state. It was a heartless statement,” the Union minister said.The issue of bringing migrant workers back to West Bengal has snowballed into a major political row over the past several weeks with the BJP and the Centre alleging that the state government is not keen to take them back, a claim rebuffed by the TMC dispensation.Criticising the state government over the “mishandling” of COVID-19 crisis in the state, Sitharaman also said that the inter-ministerial central team that visited the state for assessment of the situation had to face several roadblocks.Indicating that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act will be a major electoral plank in the assembly polls, Sitharaman demanded that Banerjee explain the reasons for opposing the legislation.“This law was brought in to help the refugees, what is the harm in it? Mamata didi needs to come clean on why she is opposing the CAA, what’s wrong in granting citizenship to refugees,” she stated.Terming the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in the state a “complete failure”, Sitharaman said the people of West Bengal should give the BJP a chance to take the state to new heights.

The clear answer is no,” Thackeray said.The unlock process, dubbed Mission Begin Again by the state government, was being gradually implemented to put the economy back on track, Thackeray said.He said the ‘Chase the Virus’ initiative that received good results in the worst-hit Mumbai would now be expanded to other parts of the state to combat the COVID-19 outbreak.As part of the campaign, 15 close contacts of each COVID-19 patient will compulsorily be kept in institutional quarantine, while community leaders will tell people about comorbidities, meals and other facilities available at institutional quarantine facilities etc, clinic timings etc.The campaign was launched on May 27.“We have received good results of Chase the Virus campaign in Mumbai and we have now decided to implement it across the state,” he said.He said he had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to extend the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Abhiyaan so that Maharashtra could continue the supply of food grains to the poor at low prices.

28-06-2020||New Delhi||Congress says PM CARES Fund accepted Chinese donations, asks why Modi not calling China aggressor||Hitting back at the BJP for raising the issue of funding to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, the Congress on Sunday alleged that Chinese firms were contributing to the PM CARES Fund and asked why it was accepting such donations when India and China had been engaged in a tense border standoff in Ladakh.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi also questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his “18 meetings” with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the past six years and asked why he had not yet called China “an aggressor”, hours after Modi in his radio broadcast asserted that India had given a befitting reply to those who cast an evil eye on its territory in Ladakh.“I implore the Prime Minister to say China is an aggressor,” Singhvi said.“What is most worrying and alarming for national security is the fact of donations received by Prime Minister Modi from the Chinese companies in his (seemingly personal) PM CARES Fund,” Singhvi said a virtual press conference.“If the Prime Minister of India will compromise his position by accepting donations of hundreds of crores from Chinese companies in the controversial and opaque fund, how will he defend the country against the Chinese aggression? Prime Minister Modi needs to answer,” he said.The PM CARES Fund was set up in March this year with an objective to deal with any emergency arising due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, certain Opposition parties have demanded the donations received by the fund be made public.Singhvi also alleged that the BJP had maintained ties with the Communist Party of China since 2007 and its presidents, starting with Rajnath Singh, Nitin Gadkari and Amit Shah, have had the maximum number of exchanges with China.“There is no political party in India’s history whose presidents have had so much contact with China in the last 13 years,” he claimed, adding that Singh had interactions with the CPC in January 2007 and October 2008; Gadkari in January 2011 went on a five-day official visit to China; and Shah sent a large delegation of MLAs at a “party school” gathering of the CPC in early 2014.Singhvi said for this government it seemed that national security was not important. “What is important for it is ‘I, Me, Myself’ and the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation.”The Congress spokesperson demanded that Modi should say “China has intruded into Indian territory” and has occupied posts and land.“The PM should say we are not going to compromise and we will push China back,” Singhvi said, adding the whole country, including the Opposition, would stand behind him if did so.Paying tributes to the 20 Army men martyred in the violent faceoff with the China’s People’s Liberation Army on June 15 in eastern Ladakh, Modi in his radio broadcast said India’s brave soldiers showed they would not allow the nation’s pride to be hurt.“Those who cast an evil eye on Indian soil in Ladakh have got a befitting response. India honours the spirit of friendship. It is also capable of giving an appropriate response to any adversary without shying away,” the Prime Minister said, without naming China.The Congress has been accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of “misleading” the country on the Chinese incursions and the border stand-off in Ladakh, citing experts who say China has occupied Indian territory and posts. On the other hand, the BJP has turned the heat on Congress by accusing it of receiving money in the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, of which Sonia Gandhi is the chairperson, from China.Coming back to the PM CARES Fund, Singhvi said reports suggested the fund had received Rs 9,678 crore by May 20. He did not specify any report.“The shocking part is that though Chinese forces have transgressed into our territory, Prime Minister has received money in the Fund from Chinese companies... Will Prime Minister answer why has he received Chinese money into the Fund despite the overt Chinese hostilities in the year 2013,” Singhvi asked.He alleged Huawei has donated Rs 7 crore, TikTok Rs 30 crore, Paytm Rs 100 crore, Xiomi Rs 15 crore and Oppo Rs 1 crore to the controversial fund.“Does Huawei have a direct connection with the People’s Liberation Army, China? Has the Chinese company owning TikTok facilitated a donation of Rs 30 crore to the controversial PM CARES Fund,” he asked.Singhvi also alleged that money had been diverted from the PM CARES Fund, noting that no one knew how it was controlled or money given to it was utilised.“The fund is not even subjected to audit by any public authority including CAG,” he said, adding that the PMO had gone to the extent of saying this fund was not a public authority.The PM CARES Fund was not even subjected to the RTI, he said alleging that the fund “appears to be solely run by the Prime Minister in an opaque and secret fashion with zero transparency and zero accountability”.

28-06-2020||New Delhi||Universities should not conduct exams amid coronavirus pandemic: Kapil Sibal||Universities should not conduct examinations in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and even holding online tests is not right as it is “discriminatory” towards poor students, former human resource development minister Kapil Sibal said on Sunday.The senior Congress leader also said that with almost half the 2020-21 academic year of schools over without proper classes due to the COVID-19 spread, board examinations for Class 10 should not be held next year as it would burden the students unnecessarily.“What has happened is that half the year has been lost and we don’t know how long this pandemic will continue. There is no need for Class 10 board exams for a while for these two years --  this year and next year—and then they could relook at this policy,” Sibal told PTI in an interview.Sibal, who as the HRD minister had spearheaded a reforms process in the education sector under which it was decided to abolish compulsory CBSE Board exams for Class 10, said it was a sensible policy to have been followed but when the NDA came to power they reversed that.“Thank god they have listened to some sane advice and they have cancelled the board exams. Consider the impact it would have had, especially on the poor students who don’t have access to any online facilities,” said Sibal, who was the HRD Minister from May 2009-October 2012 in the UPA-II government.His remarks come days after the remaining CBSE and ICSE board examinations for classes 10 and 12, scheduled to be held in July, were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.“Quite frankly even university exams should be postponed,” Sibal said.Till such time there is a pandemic, there should be no exams and holding online examinations will be “extremely discriminatory” because in a lot of places in India, in remote areas, there is no facility for online examinations and the poor will be discriminated against, he said.“See you are creating an elitist culture where the advantage goes to the rich which have access to online facilities and to those institutions which are privileged to provide online facilities and online teaching,” Sibal said.“Why should you hold these exams in the midst of a pandemic. Many of them (students) have not got teaching materials even the specially-abled persons have not been fully provided teaching materials,” he said.Delhi University on Saturday postponed the online open book exams for final-year students, which were scheduled to begin from July 1, by 10 days “in view of the prevailing situation of COVID-19 pandemic”.Several other educational institutions, including Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), have decided to conduct online open book exams.Asked if examinations are not held how university students will be promoted, Sibal said there were two issues—those who are to be promoted from the first year to the second year as well as from second year to third year, and those in the third and final year.Those going from first year to second year and those from second to third year must have appeared for semester exams during the period, so assessments can be made based on those results for them to be promoted to the next year and that should be provisional so that when full classes are held examinations can be conducted, Sibal said.“But in the meantime, their promotional prospects should not be jeopardised. That takes care of 1st year to second year and second year to 3rd year,” he said.“Now you come to the university exams. Many students who come from far off places must have gone away from the hostels, how will they take part in online exams from those places. Many of those students are from neighbouring countries, how will they sit for these exams,” Sibal asked.Noting that in some states, the universities have said they will not hold exams, he suggested that what can be done is that final-year students could be given a provisional degree based on their past performance and they can sit for exams as and when they have the materials and the tenure of the teaching class has been completed as would have happened in a regular year.“Some universities are doing that. I don’t know why that is not being done in Delhi,” he said.Asked if the Centre should introduce a uniform policy for examinations in universities, Sibal said the problem is that universities are independent institutions and the government can’t decide what they should do or not.The universities have a level of autonomy, but they themselves should find innovative ways to deal with a situation rather than have an “elitist approach and say we have decided, this is what is going to happen and we are not going to see the situation on the ground”.Thrusting these decisions on poor students is very poor management of education, he said.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16 when the central government announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as one of the measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.

28-06-2020||Kolkata||‘Terminated’ Zomato employees burn company T-shirts to protest Chinese investment in firm||A group of employees of food-delivery platform Zomato tore and burnt the company T-shirts to protest against Chinese investment in the firm, which said the protesters were terminated recently and vented their ire by riding a “wave of sensitive sentiment”.Zomato filed a police complaint against those who took part in the agitation that came in the backdrop of the killing of 20 Indian soldiers in a clash with Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15.During the protest at Behala in the southwestern parts of the city on Saturday, some agitators claimed that they quit their jobs as Zomato has a sizeable Chinese investment and urged people to stop ordering food via the company.In 2018, Ant Financial, a part of Chinese firm Alibaba, had invested USD 210 million in Zomato for a 14.7-per cent stake. The food delivery company recently raised an additional USD 150 million from Ant Financial.“Chinese companies are making profits from here and attacking the Army of our country. They are trying to grab our land. This cannot be allowed,” one of the protesters said.Another protester said they were ready to starve but would not work for companies that have investments from China.In May, Zomato laid off 520 employees or 13 per cent of its workforce in a huge retrenchment exercise due to the coronavirus pandemic.A company spokesperson on Sunday said, “This protest was conducted by a small number of delivery partners who had their contracts terminated recently for repeatedly violating our platform guidelines”.“Unfortunately, in their spite, they decided to get themselves heard by riding the wave of a sensitive sentiment. We have filed a police complaint against these miscreants,” she told PTI.However, the nature of the complaint was not disclosed.The official claimed that Zomato’s operations are continuing smoothly in Kolkata as other delivery partners have not taken part in the “misleading protest”.The company has around 3,000 delivery partners in the city, she said.

The exercise was launched on June 26.Another official said Southwest Delhi has reported a rise of 37 containment zones since the re-mapping exercise was launched, taking the number of such areas in the district to 80.According to a list of the COVID-19 containment zones issued by the government, there are 421 such areas in the national capital.North Delhi district has 59 containment zones, followed by South Delhi (56), Central Delhi (40), Shahdara (38), East Delhi (33) Southeast Delhi (32), Northwest Delhi (28), West Delhi (25), New Delhi (21) and Northeast Delhi (nine).“Till Saturday night, we have screened around two lakh people for COVID-19 in a house-to-house survey being conducted across the city. Also, 45,000 people have been screened in the containment zones,” an official told PTI.The process of screening every household in the national capital has to be completed by July 6.According to the 2011 Census, there were over 34.35 lakh households in Delhi, including 33.56 lakh in urban areas and 79,574 in rural areas.According to the COVID-19 response plan issued by the Delhi government, the re-mapping of the containment zones is to be completed by June 30.Under the new rules, the authorities have to delineate the containment zones on a micro level, instead of big ones.At least 1,100 teams comprising two members each have been formed to screen the national capital’s population for COVID-19. The teams are armed with a mobile application — SS Corona — which will send real-time details to a dedicated web portal set up by the government.Apart from basic details like name, age, address and contact number, the teams are feeding the mobile application with information such as every individual's travel history, whether or not they use the Centre’s Aarogya Setu app and if they have symptoms of influenza.The same mobile application was being used in carrying out the screening in the COVID-19 containment zones, officials had said earlier.

Our brave soldiers have shown that they will never allow the honour of mother India to be hurt,” Modi said.Dispelling despondency in some quarters of the country occasioned by a slew of negative developments in the first half including the outbreak of COVID pandemic, cyclones, earthquakes, and external aggression along LAC, Modi said the year 2020 will prove to be a milestone of this decade positively.“The country will scale new heights in various fields, peak success in the hitherto unchartered course,” Modi said, and added that he had “great hope” on the dynamism of its 130 crore people.Without naming China, he said its aggression along the LAC was being given a befitting reply.   “India knows how to be committed, and conduct friendly relations, but also knows how to see in the eyes of anyone who challenges its sovereignty,” Modi said in his monthly ‘Mann ki Baat’ radio broadcast.Paying tributes to the valour of Indian soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice during the skirmish with China’s PLA in Ladakh area, Modi said the entire country was beholden to them and their families.“The world knows India’s capability of defending its interests,” Modi said, adding that umpteen number of aggressors tried to change the course of our country’s destiny in the past, but failed.The country has inherent strength, renaissance enlightenment, knowledge and wisdom to keep intact its cultural identity and harness them for contributing to the world community.India was taking measures to become stronger and self-reliant in all fields, and pitched for “Aatm Nirbhar” campaign urging for “vocal for local”.Urging people for production and consumption of local goods, he said this would be a contribution to country’s march to self-respect and emergence as a greater power-house.He left no one in doubt that his call for self-reliance, including indigenous production of Defence hardware, was predicated on exigencies of country security and sovereignty.“World will witness peace and tranquillity if India is strong,” Modi said,He noted that India lagged in defence productions in comparison to countries who were an equal at the time of Independence. This, despite it having Ordinance Factories. This anomaly is being rectified.He urged caution and guards-up on safeguards against Corona even when the country was getting of the lockdownHe said the government has opened the Space and the Mining Sectors to private players which will help to “unlock” country’s potential- post lockdown.Also, the agriculture sector was being reformed.He batted for protection of environment and conservation of water.He paid homage to former Prime Minister late PV Narasimha Rao on his birth anniversary.Hailing him as an erudite, linguist, and a leader of great administrative skill who led the country in trying times, Modi observed that the former premier took part in Independence struggle since his early days.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mann-ki-baat-india-has-given-befitting-reply-in-ladakh-to-those-who-eyed-its-territory-says-pm-modi-105677
28-06-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus: India registers biggest spike yet, records nearly 20,000 new cases; cases surge to 5.28 lakh||With a record spike of nearly 20,000 cases in a day, India’s COVID-19 tally mounted to 5,28,859 on Sunday and the death toll rose to 16,095, while Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh announced a door-to-door survey joining several states and UTs which have opted for the exercise in their efforts to check the surge.The Centre noted that recoveries exceeded active COVID cases by over one lakh, stressing that “proactive steps” taken by it along with the states and union territories   are showing “encouraging results”.The number of active cases stands at 2,03,051, while 3,09,712 people have recovered and one patient has migrated, according to the updated data.“Thus, around 58.56 per cent patients have recovered so far,” an official said.“The graded, pre-emptive and proactive steps taken by the Government of India along with the states and UTs for prevention, containment and management of COVID-19 are showing encouraging results,” the Union Health Ministry said in a statement.India saw a surge of 3,38,324 infections from June 1 till date as the lockdown restrictions eased.The country reported 19,906 cases on Sunday. This is the fifth consecutive day that coronavirus infections have increased by more than 15,000.As the country enters the “unlock” phase, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, it will have to focus on defeating coronavirus and bolstering the economy. India has always transformed adversities into stepping stones to success and this year won’t be different, he said.He said people have to remain more vigilant compared to the lockdown period.“Always remember, if you do not wear a mask, do not observe the two-yard social distancing norms or do not take other precautions, you are putting others at risk besides yourselves, especially the elderly and children at home,” he cautioned in his monthly “Mann ki Baat” radio address.Speaking in the same vein, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said the restrictions will continue even after June 30 as the crisis is not over.“Even if I am not using the term lockdown, do not misunderstand and lower your guard. In fact, we need to show more stringent discipline,” he said.“We can’t leave this war halfway in this final phase. I am sure that you will continue to cooperate with the government to ensure that lockdown is not re-imposed,” he said in a televised address.The unlock process, dubbed Mission Begin Again by the state government, is being gradually implemented to put the economy back on track, Thackeray said.Maharashtra has reported the highest number of cases at 1,59,133 followed by Delhi at 80,188, Tamil Nadu at 78,335, Gujarat at 30,709, Uttar Pradesh at 21,549, Rajasthan at 16,944 and West Bengal at 16,711, according to the ministry data.Mumbai Police urged the city residents not to move beyond 2-km radius of their homes for the purpose of exercise or visiting shops and salons, in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus.Movement beyond 2 km is permitted only for attending office or medical emergencies, a senior police official said, adding that movement outside this radius for shopping is strictly prohibited.With the further easing of coronavirus-induced curbs in the state, some salons opened in Mumbai on Sunday after a gap of three months while many remained closed due to lack of manpower.Thackeray also said the ‘Chase the Virus’ initiative that received good results in worst-hit Mumbai will now be expanded to other parts of the state.As part of the campaign, 15 close contacts of a COVID-19 patient will be compulsorily kept in institutional quarantine.It was launched on May 27.In Delhi, where authorities are implementing a revised strategy after a major surge in cases, the number of COVID-19 containment zones has risen from 218 to 417 after a re-mapping of such areas, while around 2.45 lakh people have been screened in a mammoth house-to-house survey to check the spread of COVID-19. Officials said the count of containment zones is expected to jump further as the authorities in some districts were yet to complete the task of redrawing such areas following the Centre’s directions.“We have screened around two lakh people for COVID-19 in house-to-house survey being conducted across the city. Also, 45,000 people have been screened in COVID-19 containment zones,” an official told PTI.The process of screening every household has to be completed by July 6.According to the 2011 Census, there were over 34.35 lakh households in the national capital, including 33.56 lakh in urban areas and 79,574 in rural areas.Other states with more than 10,000 cases are Telangana (13,436), Haryana (13,427), Madhya Pradesh (12,965), Andhra Pradesh (12,285) and Karnataka (11,9230).Stepping up surveillance, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh will also conduct house-to-house survey like Delhi, Goa, Odisha and Jharkhand.Uttar Pradesh’s Additional Chief Secretary (Medical and Health) Amit Mohan Prasad said the state will launch a large-scale campaign from Meerut division in July, where house-to-house survey will be undertaken similar to the pulse polio immunisation.“It will be carried out in containment and non-containment zones,” he said.The Madhya Pradesh government said it will launch a ‘Kill Corona’ campaign from July 1 to control the spread of COVID-19 in the state.Under the campaign, door-to-door survey will be conducted and tests would also be done on citizens for other diseases as well, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said during a virtual review meeting on the COVID-19 pandemic. Chouhan said during the 15-day campaign, 2.5 lakh tests will be carried out and 15,000 to 20,000 samples would be collected daily, according to a press release.In Karnataka, Bengaluru police said criminal cases will be filed against those flouting face mask and social distancing rules and public can call police in case someone refuses to follow the COVID-19 preventive norms in the city. While police and civic body officials will patrol city roads and enforce the mask rule and social distancing, the public can also do their bit and ask every other person to follow them, Bengaluru Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao said in a series of tweets as the government stepped up efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.Bihar’s Backward and Extremely Backward Classes Welfare Minister Vinod Kumar Singh and his wife tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday and were sent to an isolation ward at a city hotel in Katihar district, officials said.India now has 1,036 diagnostic labs dedicated to COVID-19. This includes 749 in the government sector and 287 private labs.“Daily more than 2,00,000 samples are being tested. The samples tested in the last 24 hours have further increased to 2,31,095. The total number of samples tested, as on date, is 82,27,802,” the Union Health Ministry statement stated.As on June 28, the COVID related health infrastructure has been strengthened with the availability of 1,055 dedicated COVID Hospitals with 1,77,529 isolation beds, 23,168 ICU beds and 78,060 oxygen supported beds, it said.Of the 410 new deaths reported till Sunday morning, 167 were in Maharashtra, 68 in Tamil Nadu, 66 in Delhi, 19 in Uttar Pradesh, 18 in Gujarat, 13 in West Bengal, 11 each in Rajasthan and Karnataka, nine in Andhra Pradesh, seven in Haryana, six each in Punjab and Telangana, four in Madhya Pradesh, two in Jammu and Kashmir and one each in  Bihar, Odisha and Puducherry.

28-06-2020||Washington||India’s COVID-19 fight people-driven, PM Modi tells Indian-origin doctors||India’s fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic is driven by its people, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said, attributing the success against the contagion to the implementation of the nationwide lockdown in its initial phase.In an address during the virtual meeting of the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI) on Saturday, Modi said that the COVID-19 had been used as an opportunity to work towards making the country self-reliant.This is for the first time that an Indian Prime Minister addressed the annual meeting of the AAPI, a representative body of more than 80,000 Indian-American doctors in the US.Sharing the statistics of various countries, Modi said India has performed much better in the fight against the coronavirus.“As against the death rate of 350 individuals per million in the US and over 600 per million in European nations like the UK, Italy and Spain, the rate of fatalities in India is less than 12,” he said.“Uttar Pradesh has been remarkably successful in fighting against the coronavirus,” Modi said. “And same is the case with several other states as well.”          The Prime Minister attributed this to the support from the people of the country. “Rural parts of the country have largely remained untouched from this pandemic,” he said.Without people’s cooperation, Modi said, the success would not have been possible in the world’s second-highest populated country—with high density, where social gathering is a norm of life, large religious and political gatherings and large-scale interstate migration are regular.India defied the fears of the world’s top-most experts in this regard, according to Modi.India has been able to save the lives of thousands and lakhs of its citizens because of the timely lockdown, he told the Indian-American physicians.Modi said the COVID-19 pandemic has been used as an opportunity to improve the health care facilities. “For instance, at the start of the coronavirus, there was only one COVID-19 testing lab. Now there are 1,000, he said.The Prime Minister underlined that India, which imported most of its Personnel Protection Equipment (PPE) kits at the start of the pandemic, was now almost self-reliant and in a position to export them.The country is making more than 30 lakh N95 masks per week. More than 50,000 new ventilators are being made available to the healthcare sector, all made inside the country, he added.Modi said he was proud of the achievements and contribution of the Indian-origin physicians across the world in the battle against the COVID-19.India’s ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu echoed the Prime Minister and said the early lockdown has helped delay the spread of the deadly virus and save lives.Appreciating the role of the Indian-American doctors during the COVID-19, Sandhu said: “You are the real heroes who have risked your lives and have been out to assist others.”     There is a widespread recognition of their contributions in the US, he added.

The team members were seen carrying files and wearing masks and gloves as precautionary measures against Covid spread.They said the Congress leader’s statement was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) as the politician’s purported links with the Sandesara brothers, main accused in the Sterling-Biotech case, are under scanner.The ED had earlier summoned Patel (70), Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat, twice for questioning in the case, but he cited prevailing Covid-19 guidelines that advise senior citizens to stay indoors to remain safe from the pandemic. The agency then assured the Congress leader that all care would be taken while he is questioned at its office, but it was pointed out by his legal team that there are media reports about positive cases being found at the ED headquarters too.The agency then told him that they are willing to visit his home as taking the probe forward in the case was important. Subsequently, the time for home visit was fixed and the agency informed Patel that they would send the investigating officer of the case to him for questioning.The case pertains to the alleged Rs 14,500 crore bank loan fraud that is said to have been perpetrated by the Vadodara-based pharma firm, Sterling Biotech, and its main promoters — Nitin Sandesara, Chetan Sandesara and Deepti Sandesara — all of whom are absconding. Later, Patel said his conscience was clear and he had nothing to hide. He accused the government of “using probe agencies every time it faced a crisis or when there was an election”.Sterling Biotech scamThe case pertains to the alleged Rs14,500 cr bank loan fraud that is said to have been perpetrated by Vadodara-based pharma firm Sterling Biotech and its promoters — Nitin Sandesara, Chetan Sandesara and Deepti Sandesara, all of whom are absconding. It is alleged that the company took loans of Rs5,383 crore from a domestic consortium led by Andhra Bank, which had turned into non-performing assets.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-grills-congs-ahmed-patel-in-rs-14-500-cr-bank-fraud-case-105600

We will support him if he publicly condemns China. —Kapil Sibal, Congress leader“The RGF accounts were duly audited and statutory returns were filed under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA) to the Government of India. This grant has been reflected in all filings to the Income Tax Department and the Home Ministry and no authority has ever found any wrongdoing of any nature,” Surjewala said.The Congress admitted that the RGF received money from the PM Relief Fund but said, “Pursuant to the unprecedented tsunami in the last week of 2004, the RGF received a modest amount of Rs 20 lakh from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund in the 2005 financial year, which was duly utilised to undertake relief activities in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.”Surjewala said the total failure of PM Narendra Modi and Nadda “to protect national security and territorial integrity of India cannot be washed away in the cacophony of manufactured and desperate allegations vis-a-vis grants received by the RGF, which has been audited and reported both to the Income Tax Department and the Home Ministry.“The Congress leader said, “Diversion, disinformation and distraction were the hallmark of the BJP government.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-rgf-got-china-funds-for-sino-india-ties-research-105602

He said, “Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is safe and secure, and its armed forces are fully capable of protecting the country and its sovereignty.”Alleging that national interest was “sacrificed” and donations into the family-run foundation were accepted, Nadda said the RGF, which is headed by Sonia, continuously received donations from the Chinese embassy between 2005 and 2009, from the “tax haven” of Luxemburg between 2006 and 2009 and NGOs with commercial interests.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/come-clean-on-links-with-china-jp-nadda-tells-sonia-105623

India has always claimed territory till ‘Finger 8’. PLA has unilaterally stopped Indian troops from patrolling crucial areas east of Finger 4. Each spur or ridgeline is identified as ‘finger’ in military parlance and each ridgeline is separated by 2-5 kmAs of now positions of the Indian Army and People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are within 500 metres of each other, or within the range of handheld rifles carried by troops on the either side.At 135-km long glacial melt lake, which is at an altitude of approximately 14,000 ft, Indian Army and PLA troops stand deployed in good numbers around what is called the “Finger 4”. India has always claimed territory till “Finger 8”, which lies east of “Finger 4”.The PLA has unilaterally stopped Indian troops from patrolling crucial areas east of “Finger 4”. Eight mountain spurs of the Chang Chenmo range end at the north bank of this lake. Each spur or ridgeline is identified as “finger” in military parlance and each ridgeline is separated by 2-5 km. On the intervening night of May 5-6, troops of both sides clashed, resulting in injuries and damage to patrol boats of both sides. The PLA removed some Indian structures and the Indian Army repaid.Two other brawls were reported on May 14 and May 31, but were not as serious as the one on May 5-6.It is not that 2020 started these clashes. Things had been changing in the past few years. The PLA had been edgy about Indian patrols and often a face-off would occur in the disputed area – between Finger 4 and Finger 8 – a source said, adding the first physical clash happened in August 2017. This was when the two armies were locked in a 73-day stand-off at the Doklam plateau at the edge of South-eastern Sikkim, troops of the either side clashed north of Pangong Tso. The two locations are separated by more than 2000 km.After a lull of one year, aggressive patrolling from both sides resumed in 2019. In the latter half of 2019, China started objecting to India patrolling to east of Finger 4. With the snow season commencing in October-end, the patrolling was restricted.In latter part of February and early March, patrolling parties of both sides once again had a few face-offs. Indian troops found another route to complete their patrols east of Finger 4, which the PLA blocked. The Indian Army at its meetings with PLA has asked for restoration of status quo ante.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-pangong-tso-troops-are-just-500-m-apart-105442

New Delhi rejected the offer within hours on Saturday after Islamabad conveyed its readiness to reopen the corridor.DELHI'S CONTENTIONPak hasn’t built bridge over Ravi for safe journey in monsoonSources here said any such decision would have to be taken in consultation with the health authorities and other stakeholders as cross-border travel had been suspended to contain the virus.India accused Pakistan of being less than sincere in making the offer as Islamabad aired the proposal at a short notice of two days. On the other hand, the bilateral agreement provides for information to be shared by India with the Pakistan side at least seven days before the date of travel. This would need India to open up the registration process well in advance, the sources pointed out. Besides, Pakistan has not built the bridge on their side across the flood plains of Ravi river despite having committed to it in the agreement. With the advent of monsoon, it would need to be evaluated whether safe pilgrim movement was possible through the corridor.
