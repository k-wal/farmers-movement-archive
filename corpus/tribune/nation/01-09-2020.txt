A complex will come up on the land given by the government. The objective of the complex will be to serve humanity. The basic purpose will be to bring together the ethos of India and the spirit of Islam,” he told PTI.“The philosophy of Islam or any other religion is to serve humanity and that will be the primary objective. It will solve the purpose of healing the nation. The attempt will be to bring everyone together to serve the society,” he said.The Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF), a trust constituted by the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board for the construction of the mosque on the five-acre plot in Ayodhya, will oversee the work.The Uttar Pradesh government allotted the five-acre plot in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur village for the construction of the mosque on the directive of the Supreme Court.After a protracted legal tussle, the Supreme Court had on November 9 last year ruled in favour of the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.The mosque in Ayodhya was demolished on December 6, 1992 by ‘kar sevaks’ who claimed that an ancient Ram temple stood at the same site.Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the ‘bhoomi pujan’ ceremony to begin the construction of the Ram Temple on August 5.Akhtar, the Head of the Department of Architecture at Jamia Millia Islamia here, said, “Over 1,000 architects have been my students and are spread across the globe, and they can collaborate with me. The option to work on this project will be open for my current students also as it will be a learning experience for them.”                Akhtar has designed the university’s computer centre, its hospital and even the architecture building and has also worked with the Delhi government for drawing up local area plans.He has been consultant for the UNDP-sponsored programme ‘Capacity Development of Urban Local Bodies’.Akhtar said due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he would not be able to visit Ayodhya right now, but added that he had visited the site earlier and was “aware of the place”.

Both were married with families back home. On the basis of forensic examinations so far, we can say that all the five bullets were fired from Subbas SLR and no third person was involved”, the SSP told reporters.The incident, which has triggered shockwaves across the city, has also fuelled speculations that the trigger could have been pulled in a fit of rage and that the two colleagues might be having an affair.Asked whether he suspected that Subba had first killed Putung before pointing the gun at himself, the SSP said, “we are not ruling out anything at this moment.“We would be able to say more after getting feedbacks from their colleagues about what type of relationship the two deceased shared.

01-09-2020||New Delhi||Devotees can’t rub Shivalingam at Ujjain’s Mahakaleshwar Temple, orders SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday restrained devotees from rubbing the Shivalingam at Ujjain’s Mahakaleshwar Temple in order to prevent its further erosion.“Poojaries, Janeupati, Khutpati, Purohits, and their authorised representatives (have) to strictly ensure that no visitor or devotee rubs the Shivalingam at any cost. If it is done by any devotee, accompanying Poojari or Purohit shall be responsible for not stopping the rubbing,” a Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra ordered.“No rubbing of Shivalingam to be done by anyone except during traditional Puja and Archana performed on behalf of the temple,” said the Bench which issued a series of directions to management committee of the temple for preservation of the Shivalingam and better upkeep of the temple.“The rubbing of curd, ghee or honey on the Shivalingam by the devotees is also a cause of erosion.  It would be appropriate that only pouring of a limited   quantity of pure milk is allowed by the committee. Whereas in the traditional puja to be done on behalf of the temple, all pure materials can be used,” it said.“The entire proceedings of puja and archana in garbh griha to be video recorded 24 hours and be preserved at least for six months,” it said, adding if any violation is found by any poojari, purohit, the temple committee can take suitable action against that poojari or purohit.It said, as agreed by the temple committee, no Panchamrita to be poured on Shivalingam by any devotee. It may be used only during traditional puja and archana of the Shivalingam.The top court said it was for the temple committee to provide pure milk from its resources to the devotees   for offering and ensuring that no impure or adulterated milk was offered to Shivalingam. It asked the poojari/ purohit concerned to ensure compliance. The top court directed the temple committee to ensure that the pH value of Bhasma during the Bhasma Aarti was improved and Shivalingam was preserved from further deterioration and to implement the best methodology to prevent further damage to the Lingam.It asked the temple committee to ensure that weight of Mund Mala and Serpakarnahas was further reduced to preserve the Shivalingam from mechanical abrasion and find out a way and consider if it was necessary to use metal Mund Mala on the Shivalingam, or there can be a way out to use Mund Mala and Serpakarnahas   without   touching   the   Shivalingam.“Possibility of further reducing weight may also be   found out to prevent mechanical abrasion,” it said.The Bench – which also included Justice BR Gavai and Justice Krishna Murari—directed the expert committee comprising experts from Archaeological Survey of India and Geological Survey of India already appointed by it to visit the temple and submit a report by 15 December 2020, as to the steps to be taken to preserve Shivalingam and temple structure, including Chandranageshwar Temple.It sought a compliance report by second week of January 2021.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/devotees-cant-rub-shivalingam-at-ujjains-mahakaleshwar-temple-orders-sc-134790
01-09-2020||New Delhi||Chidambaram lauds 6 states for rejecting Centre’s GST proposal||Congress leader P Chidambaram on Tuesday lauded the finance ministers of six states for rejecting the Central government’s proposals for bridging the GST compensation gap.He said the states should not allow the Centre to evade its legal and moral responsibility to compensate them for the revenue shortfall.“Congratulations to the finance ministers of Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, West Bengal, Telangana and Delhi for rejecting the bogus twin options given by the central government to bridge the GST Compensation gap,” he said on Twitter.The former Union finance minister said as far as he knows, Rajasthan and Puducherry have also rejected the two options.“Happy that Tamil Nadu has also rejected the two options,” he said.“The States must not allow the Centre to evade its legal and moral responsibility to compensate the States for the revenue shortfall. The financial burden of additional borrowing must be borne by the Centre,” he said.As many as seven non-BJP ruled states and Union Territory Puducherry on Monday rejected the Centre’s suggestion that the states borrow to make up for the GST shortfall, saying the constitutional liability to fill the gap lies with the Union government.At an informal meeting on Monday, six non-BJP ruled states—Punjab, West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Telangana—felt that an alternative mechanism should be worked out to compensate the GST revenue shortfall.Besides, Congress-ruled Rajasthan and Puducherry too said they will follow suit on the issue of compensation.

01-09-2020||New Delhi||Defence minister Rajnath to leave for Russia on Wednesday to attend SCO meet||Defence minister Rajnath Singh will leave for Russia on Wednesday to attend a crucial meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which is taking place under the shadow of an escalating border row between India and China, two of the bloc's key members.Besides attending the SCO defence ministers' meeting on September 4, Singh will hold talks with Russian defence minister Sergey Shoigu and several other top military officials with an aim to expedite implementation of a number of procurement programmes, officials said.Singh will depart from Moscow on the evening of September 5, they said.Chinese Defence Minister Gen Wei Fenghe is also expected to attend the SCO meeting.The defence minister's visit comes just days after India withdrew from a multilateral war game to be held in Russia, and expected to be attended by the Chinese and Pakistani troops.Asked about the possibility of a bilateral meeting between Singh and Chinese defence minister Wei on the sidelines of the SCO event, officials said there is no such plan.The SCO defence ministers' meeting is taking place in the wake of fresh tension between India and China following Chinese army's unsuccessful attempts to change the status quo on the southern bank of Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh.The two sides have held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks to end the border standoff which began on May 5.The fresh attempts by China to change the status quo in the Pangong lake area escalated the tension further.Russia has already said that India and China should resolve the border dispute through talks and that a "constructive" relationship between the two countries was important for regional stability.It will be Singh's second visit to Moscow since June. He had represented India at the Victory Day Parade in Moscow on June 24 that commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War.Russia has also invited External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to attend the SCO foreign ministers' meeting on September 10.In his bilateral meeting with Russian Defence Minister Shoigu, Singh is likely to press for early supply of various weapons and spares to the Indian armed forces under defence contracts concluded earlier.In the talks, both sides are expected to officially finalise a long-pending proposal to produce AK 203 rifles in India.Officials said Singh is also likely to request the Russian side to ensure timely delivery of the S-400 missile defence systems to India.The delivery of the first batch of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to India is scheduled by the end of 2021.In October 2018, India had signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, notwithstanding warning from the Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions.Last year, India made the first tranche of payment of around USD 800 million to Russia for the missile systems.Officials said the SCO meeting is likely to deliberate on regional security scenarios and ways to deal with various threats and challenges.The SCO, seen as a counterweight to NATO, has emerged as one of the largest transregional international organisations which accounts for almost 44 per cent of the world population stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Indian Ocean and from the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea.The aim of the SCO is to maintain peace, stability and security of the region. India and Pakistan became members of SCO in 2017. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defence-minister-rajnath-to-leave-for-russia-on-wednesday-to-attend-sco-meet-134787
01-09-2020||Kolkata||Wearing a ‘gamcha’, Mukherjee used to walk 2 km barefoot to school in monsoon: Friend||Pranab Mukherjee, who headed several key ministries before becoming the President, used to walk two kilometres barefoot while going to a village school in West Bengal’s Birbhum district wearing a ‘gamcha’ (traditional towel) during the monsoon in the 1940s, his friend Prof Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay said.Reminiscing about his association with Mukherjee for nearly seven decades since they were admitted to a college in the district in 1952, the eminent academician rued that he could not fulfil his friend’s wish to write a biography of him.The two friends had some time back decided that Mukhopadhyay would to write a biography of the former President in English.“A few days before he fell ill, Pranab telephoned me and said it was getting late and told me that after the corona pandemic is over, he will come to Kolkata and give me three complete days to record his interview for the book, but that was not to be,” Mukhopadhyay told PTI.The former head of the Department of Political Science at Presidency College here said that Mukherjee went to a free village school at Miriti for his primary education and then to Shibchandra Uchcha Vidyalaya (High School) at Kirnahar.“At that time, those who pursued high school education in the area were sent to Labhpur town, but since Pranab’s father Kamada Kinkar Mukhopadhyay was an idealist, he wanted him to pursue his schooling at the institution in nearby Kirnahar,” Mukhopadhyay said.“Since village roads were generally muddy and waterlogged during the monsoon, he would have to wear a gamcha at times with his pants in his bag and walk barefoot two kilometres to school,” he said.On July 1, 1952, two half-pant clad boys Mukherjee and Mukhopadhyay—started attending classes at Suri Vidyasagar College and the seeds of a life-long friendship were planted there.After graduation, Mukherjee came to Kolkata and enrolled for Comparative Philology at Calcutta University, but he did not take a liking to the subject and switched to Political Science, Mukhopadhyay said.After doing his master degree in Political Science, Mukherjee also did his Masters in History, before getting an LLB (Bachelor of Law) degree.Mukhopadhyay said that his friend used to work as a private tutor at that time as he had decided not to take money from his father while pursuing his master’s degree in Kolkata.While doing his Masters, Mukherjee married his student Suvra Ghosh in 1957.“This was a revolutionary decision at that time on two counts. First, he married while he was still a student, and secondly, it was an inter-caste marriage. He came from a conservative Brahmin family,” the retired professor said.Mukhrejee later joined active politics.As a young Rajya Sabha member in 1969, Mukherjee, who was an avid reader, caught the attention of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, when she found him reading in the Parliament library for hours every day.“One evening, when he was to speak in the Rajya Sabha for the first time, there was no quorum in the House. On learning of this, Gandhi came with her ministers to attend it and was pleased to find Mukherjee’s speech very informative and logical and later made him a deputy minister in the Industries ministry,” he said.Mukherjee gradually rose to newer heights and headed several important ministries including finance, defence and external affairs before becoming the President in 2012, crowning a political career of over five decades.

He had already shot a missive to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman expressing the state’s opposition to the Centre’s move. The chief minister has pointed out that the states were at the forefront of fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and reviving the state economies, and thus, in need of more resources than the Centre.The letter which is with The Tribune reads “Telangana state suffered a revenue loss of 83 per cent in April this year whereas COVID-19 pandemic related expenditure increased”.He further wrote, “The Centre has violated the provisions of GST Compensation Act by parking the surpluses of the Compensation Fund in its Consolidated Fund instead of parking them in the non-lapsable Compensation Fund in the Public Account”. Further, the chief minister strongly opposed the Centre’s suggestion to the states to go for borrowings to meet the financial requirements.He requested Prime Minister Modi to reverse the Centre’s decision and as an alternative, the Centre can borrow the entire shortfall amount based on the strength of the receipts into the cess amount.He felt that the entire debt servicing – both principal and interest can be paid from the cess collected for such an extended period beyond 2022 which can be decided by the GST Council.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-cm-k-chandrashekhar-rao-seeks-pms-intervention-on-gst-dues-134756

However, we are yet to see any meaningful action against such elements,” he said.The Minister went on to add: “Facebook has been a novel experiment in democratising the expression of people and giving a platform to millions of ordinary citizens to freely express their views, connect, build communities, associate and communicate. I hope that you are cognizant that this experiment should not be allowed to be hijacked by a vested lobby that abhors free speech and tries to enforce one world view and rejects diversity.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ravi-shankar-to-zuckerberg-pages-of-right-of-centre-ideology-getting-deleted-134754

However, things need to change and fast because the way the “potential power house of economic growth” is being treated or managed currently, the gains may have limited and even minuscule. In any case, good harvest has not translated in increased farmers’ income because of chocked and fragmented supply chain, they addCalling for a “new normal” in the sector, agriculture policy expert Devinder Sharma says India must learn from the debacle and give agriculture its rightful place in the economy. “Agriculture is the only sector that performed well but gains also have to be equal for farmers.”“Agriculture is the only sector that can reboot the economy.  The answer to both economy and climate change is sustainable agriculture and for this we need a new normal, an economic model based on our (India’s) requirements with the sector receiving equal attention like other GDP segments.  “We cannot sacrifice agriculture for the sake of industrial growth. It has a huge role to play in employment generation which so far we have failed to understand. If agriculture was performing at the level of other sectors had been there would be food riots in the country,” says Sharma.  According to agriculture expert Sudheer Panwar, not only agriculture production remained neutral to the lock-down it also registered impressive growth (of 3.4%) when service and industry nosedived, “but to expect that agriculture production will make up the losses of industry and services sector is exaggeration because its share in the GDP is mere 15.96%”.  “One of the reasons for good harvest is favourable climatic conditions and good monsoon, which is driver of agriculture in 60% of total crop area, however, good harvest could not be translated to increased farmers’ income because of chocked/fragmented supply chain. Horticulture and perishable produce could not reach market and farmers had to plough it in fields or throw on roads. “The Central Government stepped up MSP purchase specifically wheat and paddy in UP, Punjab and MP that provided some relief to farmers. The flood situation in Bihar, Assam and other areas, locust in Rajasthan, spread of Covid-19 in rural areas may affect future prospects which look bright because of good climatic conditions,” Panwar adds. Meanwhile, the current estimate includes the agricultural production for the Rabi season, including dairy, fishery and poultry. In the kharif season, acreage has already surpassed recent records. The sector also attracted some private investments in July-August. In addition reverse migration and uncertainty of future livelihood may have also encouraged improvement in the sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-grim-economic-scenario-agriculture-emerges-as-ray-of-hope-134753

Jamia Millia Islamia has been singled out in this context,” the letter read.It went on to add that it was “completely perverse” to allege that there was a conspiracy to infiltrate Muslim officers into the services or “to use terms such as UPSC Jihad or Civil Services Jihad” in this connection.“The country is already smouldering with hate speech against Muslims, including allegations of Corona Jihad and Love Jihad, which various courts have found to be false. This telecast will add further fuel to that fire,” it said.Noting the recent judgment by the Supreme Court, while not granting a stay on the telecast of the programme, the ex-bureaucrats said: “We note that under statutory provisions, competent authorities are vested with powers to ensure compliance with the law, including provisions of the criminal law intended to ensure social harmony and the peaceful co-existence of all communities.”The group also urged the authorities concerned to order lodging of FIRs under the relevant legal provisions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/group-of-ex-civil-servants-asks-for-strong-action-against-sudharshan-tv-134734

These three states account for nearly 34 per cent of the total testing," the ministry underscored.There has been sustained growth in the average weekly numbers of tests.It has increased by four times since the first week of January. Expanded diagnostic lab network and facilitation for easy testing across the country have given it a substantial boost."The tests per million have also seen a sharp increase to 31,394," the ministry said, adding Goa, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are reporting the maximum number of tests in a day.Goa's tests per million stands at 1,30,091, followed by Delhi with 85,923 tests, Andhra Pradesh 65,078, Tamil Nadu 59,923, Assam 44,404, Karnataka 44,061, Punjab 34,815 and Maharashtra 32,723, according to the data shared by the ministry.With 69,921 people testing positive for coronavirus infection, India's COVID-19 tally mounted to 36,91,166, while the death toll climbed to 65,288 with 819 new fatalities being reported in a span of 24 hours, the health ministry data updated at 8 am showed.

01-09-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||India to borrow from Japan to fight Covid||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 1Japan and the EU have approved big loans to India to fight Covid and develop infrastructure, respectively.While Japan has lent to further equip hospitals, the EU Bank has made its second largest lending operation outside its traditional sphere to support the building of a metro in Kanpur. The Bank is also financing the construction of the metro in Lucknow, Bhopal, Pune and Bangalore. The total loan from EU alone for the two metros in UP is estimated at Rs 8,000 crore.The ballpark figure for loans taken by India to battle the pandemic is over Rs 60,000 crore which is expected to rise as more tranches are being negotiated with multilateral banks.Japanese Ambassador to India Satoshi Suzuki and Indian officials exchanged documents concerning the provision of a yen loan for response to Covid. The maximum amount that India can draw is 50 billion yen or close to $ 500 million (about Rs 3,500 crore).With its finances in acute disrepair, India has taken to negotiating for loans with individual countries. India has also borrowed from Germany and France. Germany committed an emergency support measure of 460 million Euros (Rs 3,893 crore) to support the “One Nation One Ration Card” scheme while France committed 200 million Euros (about Rs 1,700 crore) to boost the PM Garib Kalyan Yojana.The loan from Japan will help equip hospitals with ICUs and infection prevention and management facilities, which are undersupplied in India. It is also expected to lead to the enhancement of telemedicine using digital technology in numerous villages across India. The loan has been offered at 0.01 per cent per annum for 15 years.The EU Bank, EIB, has approved a Euro 650 million loan (about Rs 4,500 crore) to build a metro in Kanpur. This will be its second biggest operation outside the EU to date. The EIB will finance a 32.4 km metro line with 30 stations and the rolling stock. EIB has so far lent over Rs 20,000 crore for connectivity projects in India.This is the second metro rail project supported by the EIB in Uttar Pradesh, following the Euro 450 million (about Rs. 3,500 crore) investment in the development of a metro rail system in the city of Lucknow. “The Kanpur project is an important investment in making public transport efficient, safe and sustainable. I am happy to see the European Investment Bank fully engaged in this transformational process,” said EU Ambassador to India Ugo Astuto.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-borrow-from-japan-to-fight-covid-134720
01-09-2020||New Delhi||Mask use and social distancing may prevent 2 lakh COVID deaths in India: Study||Widespread mask use and data-driven social distancing measures in India may help prevent over 200,000 COVID-19-related deaths in India by December 1, according to a modelling study which shows the disease will continue to pose a major public health threat in the country.The study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in the US suggests that there is an opportunity to further limit the toll of COVID-19 in India.It highlights the critical need for people to comply with face mask use, social distancing, and other COVID-19 prevention guidelines as advised by the public health authorities."India's epidemic is far from over, as a large proportion of the population is still susceptible," IHME Director, Christopher Murray, said in a statement."In fact, our modelling shows there is a wide range of potential outcomes, depending on the actions that governments and individuals take today, tomorrow, and into the near future. Mask-wearing and social distancing are crucial to mitigate the spread of the virus," Murray explained.Reacting to the findings of the modelling study, Gautam Menon, Professor, Departments of Physics and Biology, Ashoka University in Haryana said it is certainly true that mask wearing and distancing measures will significantly slow the progress of the disease while protecting vulnerable populations."My first view is that the IHME model predicts a peak in infections only by early to mid-December, peak numbers of close to 6 million new infections per day and total deaths of about 500,000 in the 'no intervention' scenario," Menon told PTI.However, he noted that these numbers appear inflated compared to other estimates and models which suggest a peak that should happen well before mid-December."Given that, the estimate of lives saved (in the study) may be on the excessive side," Menon noted.The researchers in the IHME study noted that India's response to COVID-19 has produced some significant successes that highlight the opportunity to limit the pandemic's toll in the country.Giving the example of some urban areas, including Delhi, they explained that containment measures which include intensive contact tracing, widespread testing, mask-wearing, and social distancing mandates have helped reduce the spread of the virus.Their modelling study found that, in the best-case scenario, India can expect approximately 291,145 total COVID-19 deaths by December 1, up from 60,000 in late August.This scenario assumes that face mask usage increases to near-universal (95 per cent) levels and that six-week, state-level lockdowns are re-imposed if the daily death rate exceeds 8 per million in the states.On the other hand, if lockdown restrictions continue to ease up and face mask usage remains at current levels, India can expect approximately 492,380 total deaths by December 1, according to the study.In this scenario, the researchers said, 13 states would each have over 10,000 total COVID-19 deaths by that time, while currently only Maharashtra has crossed this threshold."India is at a tipping point. If hospitals in those states are unable to accommodate everyone needing COVID-19 care, the result will be more deaths and greater long-term harm to state and local economies," Murray said.The researchers said until there is a widely available vaccine against COVID-19, much of India's population remains susceptible to the disease."Monitoring trends state-by-state, encouraging mask use, continuing social distancing and hygiene precautions, and using state-level or district-level lockdowns if needed can help save lives and minimise the impact of the pandemic on India's health and economy," the researchers said.

01-09-2020||New Delhi||No party can form government in Bihar alone, alliance a reality: Sushil Modi||Confident about the ruling NDA returning to power in Bihar, Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Modi said on Tuesday that no political party is in a position to form a government alone in the state where ‘alliance politics’ has become a reality with the BJP, JDU and RJD being three major triangular forces.In an interview to PTI-Bhasha, the senior BJP leader claimed the opposition grand alliance, led by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and known as ‘Mahagathbandhan’, was nowhere in fight against the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and also lacked credibility.He said the NDA, under the state leadership of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, would contest the elections together and form the government again.“BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party), JDU (Janata Dal United) and RJD are major triangular forces of Bihar politics and alliance is the state’s reality. There should not be any misconception about it. Today, no political party is in a situation to form a government of its own,” Modi said.The term of the Bihar legislative assembly is scheduled to end on November 29 and the polls are likely to be held sometime in October-November.Referring to the 2015 assembly polls that the BJP had contested alone and the 2014 Lok Sabha elections fought alone by JDU, Modi said: “The BJP has no misunderstanding about its strength. We are strong and we have an organisation, but we will succeed only when we fight together. The BJP’s central leadership is also not under any illusion about it”.He said the alliance between the BJP and JDU has been a smooth affair since 1996 and it has provided good governance in the state with robust coordination among alliance partners.“We will contest the next assembly polls unitedly and succeed,” Modi said.Asked about the alleged discontent among the NDA partners with the JDU and the LJP (Lok Janshakti Party) targeting each other over a host of issues including holding elections during the COVID-19 pandemic, Modi called it “momentary” and hoped the issue will be resolved soon.“The leadership of all allies are very matured and strong-minded. Everything will be resolved. There will be no split in the BJP-JDU-LJP alliance. We will fight unitedly,” he said.Modi, a long-term associate of Chief Minister Kumar, rejected the opposition parties’ charge that there was resentment among people over the state government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and floods and also its alleged apathy towards migrant labourers.“The state government turned every crisis into an opportunity. There is no resentment as is being claimed. Today, neither the migrant labourers nor floods are any issue,” he said.Modi said there might have been some issues in initial days as no one was fully aware of the then emerging situation after imposition of lockdown in view of the coronavirus crisis, but the situation was under control after 10 days.Asked whether the BJP would be in a position to lead the alliance in the state in the near future, the senior BJP leader did not give a direct reply.“The place that the BJP has attained in the politics of Bihar today is not below par,” he said.Modi said the party has already decided on who will be the chief minister.“Nitish is already there and there are no ifs and buts about his role. We will contest the elections under his leadership. The BJP will ensure victory of its candidates as well as of the allies,” he said.He rejected any notion about the opposition grand alliance being able to put any major challenge against the NDA and said, “They have neither any leadership nor any credibility. There is no credibility of their leadership also. There is not even transparency”.“Their entire leadership is immersed into corruption.” he alleged, while asserting that the opposition alliance “stands nowhere against us”.Modi said the NDA has contested five elections against the grand alliance and defeated them every time.“As far as the difference of vote share between the two alliances is concerned, it has been up to 13 per cent (in state polls). The difference reached 23 per cent in the last Lok Sabha polls. It’s a huge difference,” he said.Before the 2014 parliamentary polls, the JDU had left the NDA and contested the 2015 Bihar assembly elections in alliance with RJD. The then grand alliance of RJD, JDU and Congress had formed the government in the state also, but the political scenario changed in 2017 with the JDU returning to the NDA.Modi slammed opposition parties for “ruining” Bihar under their 55 years of rule and said he was challenging them to contest the next elections on issues of ‘bijli, sadak and pani’ (electricity, roads and water).“Had they performed on these basic issues, we would have taken the state to greater heights,” he said, while claiming 80 per cent of the promises made by the BJP during the 2015 assembly polls have been already fulfilled.“Be it electricity, roads or water or even agriculture, we have done unprecedented work,” he said.

The NTRP is a 24x7 online window to make various kinds of payments into government accounts of any ministry or department using internet-based payment technologies.According to available information, PFMS has hit about 66.60 crore transactions involving a sum of Rs 12,75,980 crore so far during 2020-21 fiscal. The NTRP’s count is about 29.5 lakh transactions amounting to Rs 5,07,671 crore.The Internal Audit Wings of ministries and departments are responsible for conducting their own audit of various schemes and projects. The protocols, methodology and IT tools used for audit are different.The CGA has sought details from all its field establishments about the IT tools and procedures being used by them for conducting scheme audit and risk-based audit so that these can be studied for developing a standard internal audit protocol.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-revamping-internal-audit-protocols-to-cater-for-increasing-digital-payments-134709

He was 84.“A postal stamp I request… If the government agrees, I will be very happy,” he said.“And on the personal side, I am planning to convert the first floor or the ground floor of the house my father constructed at Jangipur into a museum-cum-library,” Abhijit said.“I will gather his personal belongings, particularly the vast number of books, gift items such as plaques and put them into that museum,” he said.Abhijit, however, rued his father could never stay in that house for longer durations. “By the time the house was constructed, he had gone to a bigger house, the President’s House,” he said, as the elder statesman left on his final journey.Abhijit remembered he had brought a jackfruit for his father from their farm in Jangipur on August 4.“Jackfruit is available in Delhi, too, but I took all the pain…because that’s from our field. I travelled by train and brought him one,” the former Jangipur MP said.“My father ate it. Fortunately, his blood sugar level remained in control. I am happy I could at least fulfil this wish of my father,” he said.Abhijit said his father had told him that in politics and otherwise, one should avoid being revengeful. “His message was clear and I will always remember it.”Abhijit also thanked the doctors for trying their best while treating his father.“They tried everything…but it seems he had completed his role in the world. He passed away at the right age. He got everything whatever a common man wants to have,” Abhijit added.Family members, relatives, friends, politicians, members of the general public and Congress workers paid their homage to the departed leader at his 10, Rajaji Marg residence.People stood in long queues in the lawns, wearing masks and maintaining a distance of two feet among each other, which typified the new normal in times of COVID-19.

"We are in the process of identifying the distressed sectors to vary benefits as per the impact of hit they have taken," he said."Please let the Centre, RBI and Bankers Association put their heads together,” Mehta said Noting that the economy has contracted by 23 per cent due to COVID19, he said several steps had been taken for stressed sectors.The top court -- which is seized of petitions demanding waiver of interest, or waiver of interest on interest on the suspended EMIs during moratorium -- had earlier commented that there was no point in charging interest on interest. Maintaining that the matter can't delay any further, the Bench posted it for further hearing on Wednesday. "Mr. Mehta, this Bench is not scheduled to sit tomorrow. We will sit tomorrow only to hear this case," the court said.Announced by RBI in March for three months, the loan moratorium is a legal authorization to debtors to postpone payment of EMIs. it was extended to six months till August 31, 2020.   The RBI and Centre maintained that a complete interest waiver was not possible as banks too had to pay interest to depositors.Noting that everything can't be left to banks, the Supreme Court had on June 17 asked the Government to consider interfering on the issue of interest waiver for the loan moratorium announced in view of COVID-19 lockdown.  "Central Government can't raise its hands in helplessness... After announcing moratorium, it can't now say it's between banks and customers. If you announced moratorium, you must ensure the benefits are given to customers purposefully," the Bench had said.Responding to a PIL filed by Gajendra Sharma, RBI had told the court that forced waiver of interest on term loans would jeopardise the financial health and stability of banks and would also harm debtors' interests.The Bench, however, had said many customers didn't avail of moratorium as they knew they weren't getting any benefits.  "Our limited concern is to ease the burden on borrowers during these trying times," it had said, adding everything can't be left to banks."It's an irony that thousands of crores have been defaulted on NPA accounts but you have to charge interest here. We are aware of the problems if interest is not charged, but a pandemic is not a normal situation," the Bench had said.The top court had asked the Centre and RBI to review the situation and clarity if banks can come up new guidelines for specific sectors such as agriculture, auto, business and home loans in this regard.It had sought to know if banks can forgo interest on the outstanding loans or if the Centre could share the burden.Earlier, the top court had asked the RBI to examine if benefits of its policy decisions were being passed on to borrowers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/loan-moratorium-capable-of-being-extended-by-two-years-centre-rbi-tell-sc-134677

01-09-2020||New Delhi||‘Ruining’ of economy began with demonetisation, govt introduced erroneous policies: Rahul||The Congress on Tuesday attacked the Centre over the GDP slump, with former party chief Rahul Gandhi alleging that the “ruining” of the economy began with the demonetisation and the government thereafter introduced one “erroneous” policy after another.The country’s economy suffered its worst slump on record in April-June, with the gross domestic product (GDP) contracting by 23.9 per cent as the coronavirus-related lockdown weighed on the already declining consumer demand and investment.“GDP - 23.9. The ruining of the country’s economy began with demonetisation. Since then, the government introduced one erroneous policy after another,” Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet.GDP -23.9देश की अर्थव्यवस्था की बर्बादी नोटबंदी से शुरू हुई थी।तब से सरकार ने एक के बाद एक ग़लत नीतियों की लाइन लगा दी।https://t.co/rNewLiHfB2  Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also alleged that the government was responsible for the slump in the economy.Rahul Gandhi had spoken of an “economic tsunami” six months ago while the government announced a package just for “show” and look at the condition now, Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.The BJP government has caused a slump in the economy, she alleged.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a tweet in Hindi: “Modi ji, at least now accept that what you hailed as masterstrokes were actually ‘disaster strokes’ — demonetisation, faulty GST and lockdown.”मोदी जी,अब तो मान लीजिए कि जिसे आपने “मास्टर स्ट्रोक” कहा, वास्तव में वो “डिसास्टर स्ट्रोक” थे!नोटबंदी, ग़लत जीएसटी,औरदेशबंदी (तालाबंदी) ।#GDP2020  6 Years of Govt - “Acts of Fraud” !Last three months- “Act of God” ?Fraud on People, Blame on God !!!MODI HAI TO YE BHI MUMKIN HAI !#GDP2020  The GDP contraction is the sharpest contraction since quarterly figures started being published in 1996 and worse than what was expected by most analysts.Chief Economic Adviser KV Subramanian, however, has said the economy was “experiencing a V-shaped recovery” after the lockdown eased.

Despite all odds, it was done,” Ajay Pal Lamba, who was posted as Deputy Commissioner of Police-West in Jodhpur in 2013, told PTI.Lamba has penned his experience of the case in a book titled “Gunning for the GODMAN - The true story behind Asaram Bapu’s conviction”, recalling the hardship and challenges he and his team faced during the investigation and the trial.The book, co-authored by Sanjeev Mathur and published by HarperCollins Publishers, will be released virtually on September 5.Lamba said he, his team members, witnesses and even lawyers received threats during the investigation and trial.Asaram was arrested by a team from the Jodhpur police from his ashram in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, on August 31, 2013, and taken to Jodhpur via Delhi by air.According to Lamba, it was while the team was talking to Asaram in his ashram before his arrest that he boasted about his political connections and told a police officer: “Soon you will receive orders from your superiors that you cannot arrest me.”However, Asaram panicked when the officer switched off his mobile phone in front of him, Lamba, a 2005-batch IPS office presently posted as Additional Commissioner of Police in Jaipur, recounted.Two members of the investigation team were deputed to stay at the ashram as Asaram’s followers to collect evidence.“It was discovered that he had some kind of sex addiction and demanded a new nubile girl every night,” Lamba writes in the book, referring to the claim of some individuals associated with Asaram.The girls were made to believe by Asaram’s aides that they were sick and must “surrender” to him if they wanted to be cured, he said.It is claimed that members of Asaram’s ashram management, especially the matron of the Chhindwara ashram, Shilpi, were always on the lookout for underage and attractive girls studying or staying at the ashram who could be brainwashed into believing that the accused was “god incarnate and that they were his chosen ones”.“The girls were made to feel inadequate or sick and convinced that their cure lay with Baba Asaram. They were told that they must surrender to him totally if they wanted to be remedied of their ills,” Lamba said.He said the young girls, usually from poor families, were either “paid off” later or threatened with dire consequences if they say a word about their ordeal.“There was parental pressure too. They were, therefore, not in favour of taking any legal action against the accused,” he said in the book.Lamba narrated in detail his experience of questioning Asaram when he was brought to Jodhpur and lodged in a police guest house.“‘Baba, tu yeh bata ki yeh sab kya kar dala tune. Jaldi bata.’ I asked him in a gruff voice, with contempt in my eyes. (Baba, you tell me why you did all this. Tell me quickly) What he said in response astounded me. ‘Galti kar di… galti kar di maine (I committed a mistake… I committed a mistake’.”“That was exactly where I wanted him. My plan had succeeded. I knew that it would now be easy to make him confess to his crime and to corroborate the allegations against him,” the officer said in the book.Lamba said he meticulously selected every single member in his team, those with expertise in areas such as forensic science, legal matters and interrogation. They comprised both young and experienced officers with high integrity and reliability to be able to take the case to a logical conclusion.He claimed that Gujarat police, which was investigating the case against Asaram’s son Narayan Sai, had revealed that an accused in that case planned to kill a woman officer, Chanchal, by blowing up her vehicle with an IED.“In the wake of such disclosures, Chanchal had to be provided additional armed guards round the clock even when she was later transferred to Bhilwara district,” he said.The officer told PTI that he held regular media briefings to make sure that no speculative news was generated. This proved to be a crucial factor, particularly during his arrest.“I decided to write the book to give a first-hand account of the investigation and the challenges in the high-profile case. It tells about the importance of planning, teamwork, leadership qualities which are essential to execute a task,” he said.Asaram was sentenced to life in jail till natural death by a Jodhpur court on April 25, 2018. The court awarded 20 years imprisonment to two co-accused, including Chhindwara ashram matron Shilpi, and acquitted two others, Shiva and Prakash.The teenaged victim from Shahajahanpur in Uttar Pradesh, who was studying at Asaram ashram, had accused him of raping her on the night of August 15, 2013. An FIR was lodged with a police station in Delhi and was transferred to Jodhpur for investigation.

01-09-2020||Mumbai||1 in 3 Indians saving up to Rs 5K a month due to work from home: Survey||At least one in three persons (29 per cent) employed in urban cities in India are saving Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 on an average in a month as a result of working from home, which was otherwise spent on commuting, clothing and food in the normal scheme of things, a new survey said on Tuesday.While 74 per cent of the respondents in the online survey said they were willing to work remotely, 80 per cent pointed out that their job roles can be performed from a remote environment, according to the survey from Awfis, India's largest homegrown flex workspace provider.The survey was conducted over a period of two months (June and July) across seven metros and analysed inputs from 1,000 employees across diverse industries.While 47 per cent employees reported a lack of comfortable desk and chair, 71 per cent said that they would be successful in working from home if they have a dedicated area to work from.Nearly 60 per cent of employees usually spend more than an hour commuting to and from the office.Owing to work from home, on average, an employee saves 1.47 hours of travel time daily – translating to time worth 44 additional working days in a year, the findings showed."To be effective, organisations across diverse industries need to understand the changing requirements and challenges faced by their employees and provide them with the required resources," said Amit Ramani, CEO and Founder, Awfis.The positive sentiment to work from remote locations can be attributed to factors like significant cost savings, considerable time savings, better time management and self-discipline.Nearly 27 per cent of the employees felt they lack opportunities for engaging with colleagues and developing strong networks."A combination of virtual and physical environments will come to define the future of how India works, thereby giving rise to the emergence of distributed workspaces that will cut across physical headquarters, satellite offices and homes pan-India," the survey said.For example, a company with a strength of 100 employees will follow a 60/30/10 split for deciding the work location (work from home, work near home or work from the main office).The co-working sector is poised to become 20 per cent of the total commercial estate (CRE) market in the next two-three years, as compared to the current five per cent."By means of this survey, we were able to deconstruct the employee perspective and share critical insights that would help managers and organisations in devising sustainable remote working strategies," said Ramani.

01-09-2020||New Delhi||JEE Mains held amid stringent precautions||The Joint Entrance Exam (JEE)-Mains for admission to engineering colleges began on Tuesday amid stringent precautions and social distancing measures in view of COVID-19 pandemic.Staggered entry and exit for candidates, sanitisers at the gate, distribution of masks and maintaining social distancing as candidates queued up, were among the scenes witnessed at the exam centres across the country.The exam which has been postponed twice in view of COVID-19 pandemic is scheduled from September 1 to 6."Hand sanitisers are being made available at the entrance of the examination centre and inside the exam hall at all times. The usual process of checking the admit cards of candidates has been replaced with barcode readers, which have been made available to the examination centre authorities," said an official of the National Testing Agency (NTA)."While all the candidates are asked to go to the exam centres with masks and sanitisers, once they enter the centre, they have to use the masks provided by the examination authority. Each candidate will be offered a 3-ply mask at the time of entry and expected to wear the same during the examination in order to avoid any form of unfair means at the time of examination," the official added.The first shift of the exam began at 9.30 am while the second shift will begin from 2.30 pm."Before the start of each exam shift and after the last shift ends, all seats will be thoroughly sanitised and the work stations and keyboards will be disinfected," the NTA official said.Over 9 lakh candidates have registered for the JEE-Mains exam for admission to engineering courses in IITs, NITs and Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs). Increasing the number of examination centres, alternate seating plans, fewer candidates per room and staggered entry and exit are among the steps the National Testing Agency has taken for safely conducting the crucial exam.While the governments of Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have assured students that they will provide transportation to candidates, a group of IIT alumni and students have also launched a portal to provide transport facilities to exam centres for the candidates in need.There has been a growing chorus for postponing JEE-Mains and medical entrance exam NEET amid the rising number of COVID-19 cases. The Supreme Court had earlier dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the two exams amid a spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases, saying a "precious year" of students cannot be wasted and life has to go on. Based on the results of the JEE-Mains Paper 1 and Paper 2, the top 2.45 lakh candidates will be eligible to appear for the JEE-Advanced exam, which is a one-stop exam to get admission into the 23 premier Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). JEE-Advanced is scheduled to take place on September 27. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jee-mains-held-amid-stringent-precautions-134662

01-09-2020||Nagpur||HC refuses to stay JEE-Main examination||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court on Tuesday refused to stay the JEE-Main examination, but said any student residing in flood-hit parts of Maharashtra's Vidarbha region who cannot reach the exam centre or reaches late can apply to the National Testing Agency to seek a re-examination.A Division Bench of Justices Ravi Deshpande and Pushpa Ganediwala said the National Testing Agency (NTA) shall consider such applications and decide accordingly, after checking the veracity of the same, within 15 days.The engineering Joint Entrance Examination (JEE)-Main began at 9 am across the country on Tuesday."The situation is grim in several districts due to floods. Students should not suffer for no fault on their part,” the Bench said.The court said any aggrieved student could file an application to the NTA via their centre coordinator."The National Testing Agency shall then decide on the application after consulting with the District Collector concerned within a period of 15 days," the court ordered.Assistant Solicitor General Ulhas Aurangabadkar, appearing for the NTA, told the High Court that the agency shall consider any application submitted by a student who was not able to appear for the exam due to the flood situation or problem of transport.Earlier, the High Court on Monday took cognisance of a letter written to it by Nitesh Bawankar, a resident of Maharashtra's Bhandara district, raising concern over how students will reach the exam centres to appear for the JEE amid the flood situation.Also read: 7.77 lakh to take JEE Mains from todayBawankar sought postponement of the exam for students residing in the flood-hit parts of Nagpur, Amravati, Akola, Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gondia and Gadchiroli districts.Due to floods, students from these areas will find it difficult to appear for the JEE-Main examination, he said.On Tuesday, Gadchiroli collector told HC that due to heavy rains and flood, inter-district transport was affected and the situation might remain unchanged for a few more days.In such a condition, the NTA would be the appropriate authority to decide the issue of postponing the exam for students affected by flood, said the Collector.Nagpur Collector told the court that 1,284 students were to attend the exam in six centres of the district and that there was no flood-like situation there.Akola Collector also told the court that as there was no flood-like situation in the district, there would be no hurdle in conducting the exam there.A similar submission was made by Amravati Collector.Chandrapur collector told the court that 21 villages were affected by flood in the district and rescue teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) enquired at local levels if there were any students who needed to appear for the JEE-Main exam, but no response was received.He also said there were four examination centres at the Chandrapur district headquarters which was not affected by flood and hence, was accessible by road.Collectors of Bhandara and Gondia told the court that while their districts were worst hit due to heavy rains and release of water from the Sanjay Sarovar dam in Madhya Pradesh, there were no centres for JEE-Main examination in both these districts.They submitted that candidates appearing for the examination shall have road accessibility to Nagpur and would not face any problem in appearing for the exam.The court on Monday directed the Centre, Maharashtra Government, the NTA and Collectors of these districts to consider postponing the JEE-Main exam for students who were residing in the flood-affected areas and were unable to reach the centres to appear for the exam.

However, he was not released for four days and the NSA was subsequently invoked against him. Hence, his detention was illegal, the petition argued.Khan was in jail since January after he delivered an allegedly provocative speech at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests in December last year.

01-09-2020||New Delhi||August receives 27 pc more rainfall, fourth highest in 120 years||The country received 27 per cent more rainfall than normal in August, the fourth highest amount in the last 120 years, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.The overall rainfall recorded in India from June 1 to August 31 was 10 per cent more than normal, the IMD said on Monday.                            "August has recorded 27 per cent more rainfall than normal," R K Jenamani, scientist with IMD's national weather forecasting centre, said."Rainfall recorded in August 2020 is the fourth highest in the last 120 years and highest in 44 years," Jenamani added.This is also one of the rainiest months of August recorded. The August of 1926 saw 33 per cent more rainfall than normal, the highest precipitation recorded so far in the month; 1976 recorded 28.4 per cent more rainfall than normal, while the August of 1973 recorded 27.8 per cent than normal. This year saw 27 per cent rainfall.  Mahesh Palwat, vice president, Skymet Weather, said due to formation of five low pressure areas in Bay of Bengal in August, the month recorded excess rainfall.A low-pressure area is a cyclonic circulation. It is also the first stage of a cyclone. However, it is not necessary that every low pressure develops into a cyclonic storm."August saw unusually high formation of low-pressure areas. Of the five, three even reached Gujarat and Rajasthan. One low pressure area intensified into a deep depression, while another developed into a well-marked low-pressure area. This gave good rainfall over central and east India," Palawat said.Several parts of the country witnessed floods last month due to incessant rainfall.June had recorded 17 per cent more rainfall than normal while July ended with a 10 per cent rainfall deficiency.The IMD had predicted that July will get rainfall that is 103 per cent of the Long Period Average (LPA), which falls in the "normal" category.In its long-range forecast for rainfall in the second half (August-September) of the 2020 Southwest Monsoon released last month, the IMD said August was likely to receive rainfall that is 97 per cent of the LPA with an error margin of plus/minus nine per cent."Quantitatively, the rainfall over the country as a whole during the second half of the season is likely to be 104 per cent of the LPA with an error margin of plus/minus eight per cent," it had said.The LPA rainfall over the country for the 1961-2010 period is 88 centimetres.Monsoon in the range of 96-104 per cent of the LPA is considered normal. The official rainfall season in the country is from June 1 to September 30.The northwest division of the IMD has a 9 per cent deficiency. It comprises Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana and the Union territories of Chandigarh, Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.The central India division received 21 per cent more rainfall. The division comprises Goa, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and the Union territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.The south peninsula meteorological division of the IMD has received 20 per cent more rainfall than normal. The division covers Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Kerala, Karnataka and the Union territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep and Puducherry.The east and northeast India division has also recorded 2 per cent more rainfall. The division comprises West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and the northeastern states. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/august-receives-27-pc-more-rainfall-fourth-highest-in-120-years-134646

India has also raised concerns about Chinese deployment in areas near the Black Top and Helmet Top.Indian troops have also occupied hill tops and the Chinese want them to step back.Talks between the two sides also took place for five hours on Monday.Indian and Chinese troops were engaged in skirmishes at the southern bank of the Pangong Lake where the Chinese brought in close to 450 troops and attempted to change the status quo, the Indian Army said as it thwarted the opponent's effort.Sources said Chinese People's Liberation Army troops with help of ropes and other climbing equipment started climbing at a table-top area between Black Top and Thakung Heights at Pangong Tso's south bank.Hearing the commotion, the Indian Army was alerted and swung into action.Earlier, Indian intelligence agencies had alerted the Indian Army about the Chinese's PLA plans to change the status quo in other areas along the Line of Actual Control. Thereafter, skirmishes erupted between both sides but things did not escalate. When Chinese troops saw the strength of Indian troops, the skirmishes stopped."Both the countries' troops are still in an eyeball-to-eyeball position," said a source. To further de-escalate, the brigade commander-level flag meeting is taking place.The Indian Army, however, has officially denied any skirmish.In a statement issued here, the Indian Army said that on the intervening night of August 29 and August 30, PLA troops violated the previous consensus agreed in military and diplomatic engagements during the ongoing standoff in eastern Ladakh and carried out provocative military movements to change the status quo."Indian troops pre-empted this PLA activity on the southern bank of Pangong Lake, and undertook measures to strengthen our positions and thwart Chinese intentions to unilaterally change facts on the ground," the force said.The Indian Army also stated that they are committed to maintaining peace and tranquillity through dialogue, but are also equally determined to protect India's territorial integrity.China on Monday maintained its troops never crossed the Line of Actual Control.

01-09-2020||New Delhi||Yechury urges Modi to defer finalisation of Health Data Management Policy||CPI(M) chief Sitaram Yechury urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to defer the finalisation of the Health Data Management Policy (HDMP) and the National Digital Health Mission ( NDHM) till Parliament concludes its consideration of the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2019.In a letter to Modi, Yechury said the former's intervention was required in the backdrop of comments sought by the Union government on HDMP by September 3, 2020."This needs to be postponed and no policy may be finalised before a structured discussion on the serious implications contained in this draft are considered," Yechury said about the provisions in the draft of the HDMPSuch a discussion is imperative because the HDMP is part of the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) that was announced by Modi on Independence Day 2020."Strangely, the government has sought comments on the HDMP in isolation and not the NDHM as a whole," Yechury said in the letter.The CPI(M) head raised apprehension about the government's move, saying the NDHM proposes to collect sensitive personal data of all citizens which will then be made available to private insurance corporates and pharmaceutical companies.Besides, Yechury's objection is against the HDMP allegedly skipping any reference to PDP Bill, which is pending in Parliament.The bill was introduced in Parliament following a marathon debate in the country on the protection of personal data in the context of surge of digitisation.The Opposition parties also contextualised the vulnerability of data with national security."Infact the proposed HDMP has many provisions that amount to a serious dilution of the essence of the Bill before parliament i.e. regarding governance of data protection," Yechury said.Both the houses of Parliament have been convened to meet on September 14. It should discuss and consider the NDHM and the HDMP while it discusses the PDP Bill.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yechury-urges-modi-to-defer-finalisation-of-health-data-management-policy-134642
01-09-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||After second incident in week, India asks China to control its troops||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 1India on Tuesday charged Chinese troops of having made a second attempt in a week to change the status quo in the South Bank area of Pangong Lake.The attempt took place on August 31 even as the ground commanders of the two sides were in discussions to de-escalate the situation due to the scuffle that had taken place on August 29 night.In a demarche, New Delhi has asked Beijing to discipline and control their frontline troops from undertaking such provocative actions. “Due to the timely defensive action, the Indian side was able to prevent these attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo,” said the Ministry of External Affairs in a statement.Chinese troops had first engaged in provocative military manoeuvers late in the night of August 29 and the next day in an attempt to change the status quo in the South Bank area of Pangong Lake. Soon after, the Army said it had responded to these provocative actions and taken appropriate defensive measures. MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava regretted that Chinese action and behaviour along the LAC since earlier this year has been in clear violation of the relevant bilateral agreements and protocols.“The Indian side is firmly committed to resolve all outstanding issues along the LAC in the Western Sector through peaceful dialogue. In this context, we expect the Chinese side to sincerely abide by the understanding reached earlier and earnestly work with India to resolve the situation and to restore peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” said Srivastava.Meanwhile, China gave different responses to the clashes on the line of actual control (LAC) on the night of August 29 and the next day.The Chinese mission said India had “grossly violated China’s territorial sovereignty, seriously violated relevant agreements, protocols and important consensus”. In a statement on Tuesday, the Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong accused Indian troops of turning their backs on the consensus reached in several rounds of diplomatic and military level talks. She specifically complained of Indian troop activity “across the LAC” at the southern bank of the Pangong Tso Lake and near the Reqin Pass. These, it said, were “flagrant provocations, which again stirred tension in the border areas”.But in Europe, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said there were bound to be some problems because the India-China boundary is yet to be demarcated. “China-India relations have recently attracted the attention of all parties. The boundary between China and India has not yet been demarcated, so there will always be problems of this kind. We are ready to manage all kinds of issues through dialogue with the Indian side,” he said in Paris at an interaction with French strategic experts at the French Institute of International Relations.“Differences should be managed and controlled, and in particular, differences should not escalate into conflicts. I think that various departments of the two countries should implement important consensus,” he added.India has also taken a similar approach as the Chinese of blowing hot and cold on the LAC conflict. Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat has said the military option is on the table if talks fail to yield results. On the other hand Foreign Minister S Jaishankar on Monday spoke of achieving some sort of an equilibrium in ties with China and, a couple of days after Gen Rawat’s statement, had said no border dispute has been solved by military action.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-second-incident-in-week-india-asks-china-to-control-its-troops-134641

01-09-2020||New Delhi||UP govt should provide insurance cover to all journalists: Priyanka||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday urged the Uttar Pradesh government to provide insurance cover to journalists, asserting that scribes are performing the important duty of providing information amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Her appeal to the government came after the death of a young journalist due to COVID-19."A very sad news. Neelanshu Shukla, a young journalist from Lucknow, is no more. He was battling COVID-19 since many days," Priyanka Gandhi said in a Facebook post in Hindi.Paying tributes to Shukla, the Congress general secretary said he was a talented journalist.May God give courage to his family to bear the suffering in this hour of grief, she said."I raised this issue earlier as well that journalists are performing the important work of providing information in times of (the coronavirus) crisis," Priyanka Gandhi said."The UP government should provide financial help to Neelanshu Shukla's family and insurance cover to all journalists," she said.

01-09-2020||Washington||Scientists develop portable, point-of-care Covid test||Scientists, including one of Indian-origin, have developed a prototype of a rapid COVID-19 test using a simple-to-use portable instrument for reading the results with a smartphone in 30 minutes, an innovation that may enable point-of-care diagnosis without needing to send samples to a lab.According to the study, published in the journal PNAS, the new technology may help overcome bottlenecks in supplies and laboratory personnel which have led to long waiting times for COVID-19 test results in several parts of the world amidst the ongoing pandemic."If such a device and test were available, we could test for COVID-19 at public events, auditoriums, large gatherings and potentially even at home for self-testing. The results could be sent back to the appropriate public health system for coordination," said Rashid Bashir, a professor of bioengineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in the US.In one of the common methods to test for the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, health care workers take a sample from patients with a long nasopharyngeal swab, which is put into a substance called viral transport media, and sent to a lab for extracting, isolating and multiplying the viral genetic material, the scientists said.This viral RNA multiplication process, called RT-PCR, requires several temperature fluctuation cycles, specialised equipment and trained personnel, said Brain Cunningham, another co-author of the study.In the current research, the scientists used a simpler process to analyse the viral transport media, called LAMP, which bypasses the RNA extraction and purification steps."LAMP only needs one temperature -- 65 C -- so it is much easier to control," said Anurup Ganguli, the first author of the study."Also, LAMP works more robustly than PCR, especially when there are contaminants in the test sample. We can just briefly heat the sample, break open the virus, and detect the genetic sequence that specifically identifies SARS-CoV-2," Ganguli said.When the researchers compared the LAMP assay with PCR, they found the results were in agreement, following which they documented the sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP test.The scientists then incorporated the assay onto a small 3D-printed cartridge that has two input slots for syringes -- one for the sample-containing viral transport media, one for the LAMP chemicals.Once the two syringe components are injected, they react within the cartridge, the study noted."We use modern, high-speed additive manufacturing to make these cartridges. The entire thing can be quickly scaled up to hundreds of thousands of tests," said Bill King, another co-author of the study from the University of Illinois."Production scale-up is typically the biggest obstacle for commercial applications of microfluidic cartridges, and we can overcome that obstacle using this new approach. Modern additive manufacturing is elastic and scalable, and it can be ramped up very quickly compared with legacy manufacturing technologies," King said.According to the researchers, the cartridge can be inserted into a hand-held portable instrument with a heating chamber, which heats the cartridge to 65 degrees Celsius for the duration of the reaction, and a smartphone cradle is in place for reading the results.In approximately 30 minutes, a positive result would emit fluorescent light, they said."The reader illuminates the liquid compartments with light from blue LEDs, while the phone's rear-facing camera records a movie of the green fluorescent light being generated," Cunningham explained.The scientists noted that they are currently assessing whether the assay would work with saliva samples to eliminate the need for nasopharyngeal swabs.

01-09-2020||New Delhi||No major impact of Ola, Uber drivers’ strike in Delhi||A strike called by a section of Ola and Uber drivers here on Tuesday had no major impact as passengers said they did not face any hassle in booking the cabs.A section of drivers associated with the two cab aggregators went on a strike to demand a fare hike and a moratorium on loan repayment.Kamaljeet Singh Gill, the president of the Sarvodaya Drivers Association of Delhi said nearly 250 drivers gathered at Mandi House here to raise their demands but police dispersed them.Meanwhile, passengers claimed that they did not face issues while booking a ride even though Gill claimed that the strike affected cab availability in many parts of the city.“In some areas like Dwarka and Uttam Nagar, people paid more money to travel as cabs were not available,” he claimed.Rashmi Dixit, a resident of Palm Olympia Housing Society in Greater Noida, booked an Ola from the society to her office in Naraina around 7.30 am on Tuesday and did not face any hassle.“I had heard about the strike and was initially apprehensive about finding a cab. But I found a cab within five minutes and did not face any issues during the entire trip apart from the morning rush hour traffic,” she said.Another commuter, who travelled from east Delhi to south Delhi, said that he did not face difficulty in booking a cab and the waiting time was also not high and even the fare was normal.Cab aggregator Uber regretted the “minor inconvenience” caused to a small section of its riders due to the strike, whereas Ola did not comment on it.“Drivers remain at the heart of our business, and we will continue to create sustainable livelihood opportunities for them, while also ensuring we have robust processes in place to both hear them and address their concerns,” said an Uber spokesperson.Taxi drivers of various associations in Delhi-NCR, who work with Ola and Uber, decided to go on strike from Tuesday as their appeals for help did not lead to any action by the government, Gill said.“Due to the acute financial crisis caused by the coronavirus-induced lockdown, drivers are unable to pay their EMIs. The moratorium of loan repayment ended and the banks are already putting pressure on us. Drivers are scared that banks will tow away their vehicles for not paying EMIs,” he said.The drivers have also demanded that fares should be hiked and their commission increased by the cab aggregators.Gill said fares should be fixed by the government instead of the cab aggregators. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-major-impact-of-ola-uber-drivers-strike-in-delhi-134632

Leaders paid floral tributes to a photo of Mukherjee, while his remains were kept in another room.Besides the 'VIPs', workers of various parties and the general public stood in long queues maintaining social distancing, wearing masks and carrying bouquets as they waited patiently to catch a glimpse of Mukherjee for one last time.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat, Army Chief Gen M M Naravane, Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria and Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh visited the late president's home to condole his death. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, CPI general secretary D Raja and BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia were also there to pay their respect to a man who had spent more than five decades in public life and was admired as a "consensus builder".  "Whether people agreed with him or not, he was very forthright in articulating his views keeping in view the interests of the country," Raja told reporters.Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel said Mukherjee never differentiated between leaders of the ruling party and the Opposition. "He was an excellent politician, orator... For the Congress, he was the helmsman. He won the the hearts of everyone. Our prime minister respected him so much, one can imagine, how important he was for the country. He was a true Bharat Ratna," Goel told reporters.Mukherjee, 84, leaves behind his daughter and two sons. "I am planning to build a museum cum library in his memory on one floor, first or the ground, at our house in Jangipur in West Bengal," his son Abhijeet Mukherjee said, an acknowledgement of his father's enduring connect with his home state.Mukherjee was admitted to the Research and Referral Hospital on August 10 and was operated for removal of a clot in the brain the same day. He also tested positive for COVID-19 during his admission and was being treated for a lung infection.  The statesman and scholar, known for his encyclopaedic memory and sharp intellect, served as the country's first citizen from 2012 to 2017. In 1982, he became India's youngest finance minister when he was just 47. In the years that followed, he served as India's Minister for External Affairs, Defence, Finance and Commerce and was the first Indian president to have done so.Mukherjee had the distinction of serving three prime ministers as a minister -- Indira Gandhi, P V Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh - and was the party's trusted Man Friday as it evolved over the decades.The seven-time parliamentarian was also India's only non-prime minister who was the leader of the Lok Sabha for eight years. He was also the leader of the Rajya Sabha from 1980-85.Mukherjee's tenure as president will stand out for the tough stance he took on mercy petitions. Of the 34 mercy petitions presented to him, he rejected 30. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-photos-former-president-pranab-mukherjee-cremated-with-full-state-honours-134630

Later, it had rejected their review petitions, saying there was no "justifiable reason" to entertain their pleas.Telcos wanted to make a staggered payment, contending that they faced financial constraints. The DoT had supported their plea and urged the court to allow staggered payment AGR dues by telcos in the next 20 years.The Bench, which also included Justice BR Gavai and Justice Krishna Murari, had reserved the verdict on July 20 on the aspect of granting timeline to telcos for staggered payment of AGR- related dues.However, the Bench had made it clear that it will not hear "even for a second" any arguments on reassessment or re-calculation of AGR.During the hearing, it had asked telcos to furnish books of accounts for the last ten year. It had said 15-20 years sought by some telecos was not reasonable.Last month, the DoT had said all liabilities, including AGR-related dues, should be cleared by telecos before spectrum trading.The DoT had said it can seek to recover dues from sellers and buyers of the spectrum, jointly or individually.The DoT had said that no demand has been raised against Reliance Jio and Airtel for part dues of Reliance Communications (RCom) and Videocon respectively.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-grants-10-year-time-to-telecos-to-clear-agr-dues-134625

It's going to take a little more energy," Biegun said."The time is short before the US elections and a lot of governments around the world are hedging a little bit. I wouldn't be surprised if the Indian government as well,” the American diplomat said.The US remained India's top trading partner for the second consecutive fiscal in 2019-20. According to the data of the commerce ministry, in 2019-20, the bilateral trade between the US and India stood at USD 88.75 billion, as against USD 87.96 billion in 2018-19.The US is one of the few countries with which India has a trade surplus. The trade gap between the countries has increased to USD 17.42 billion in 2019-20 from USD 16.86 billion in 2018-19, the data showed.In 2018-19, the US had surpassed China to become India's top trading partner.

The top court declared unconstitutional the MCI regulation that barred states from extending the benefit of such reservation to in-service doctors.A state legislature has the authority to provide reservation for in-service doctors, but state regulations must provide for work bonds for five-year service in rural/remote areas for the person who gets PG admission through this reservation, the top court said.The Bench asked states to formulate their schemes for rural/remote service by in-service doctors after completing PG degree. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-okays-quota-for-in-service-doctors-in-pg-admissions-134465
01-09-2020||New Delhi||BJP attacks Congress over donations to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation||The BJP today accused the Gandhis and the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) of accepting donations from persons involved in fraudulent and anti-India activities and indicted under PMLA like fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi, Islamist preacher Zakir Naik, Yes Bank’s Rana Kapoor and Jignesh Shah.Praising the Army, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra attacked the Congress for its “red eye” jibe against PM Narendra Modi, questioning why “the party is always in tears” whenever the Indian Army does something brave.“It is not a party issue, but the matter is about the country. The Army has already issued a statement on this incident. We all feel proud about our country and the country feels proud of our Army,” Patra said, asking Congress leaders Randeep Surjewala and Rahul Gandhi to clarify why they were always in tears whenever the Indian Army does something brave.“India has always had red eyes, but the Congress is always in tears. The country is in safe hands today and people have faith in the Indian Army and the government,” he said in response to Congress’ attack against the Narendra Modi government, asking when the PM will show his “red eyes” to China.Patra alleged the RGF receiving donations from persons facing severe charges under the PMLA was not a “coincidence, but a conspiracy”.Patra claimed said Choksi, an accused in the PNB fraud case, donated Rs 10 lakh to the foundation in 2014 through a company owned by his family, while Kapoor, the arrested founder of Yes Bank, donated Rs 9.45 lakh to the foundation in September 2016.

But, before that, how many Chinese companies have donated to the PM Cares fund that should also be investigated,” Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said.Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted, “A scared Modi government will do a press conference and will not answer China’s transgressions of our territory, sinking GDP, but will instead blame Congress, Sonia Gandhi, RGF, weather and God.”Congress secretary Pranab Jha dismissed the allegations as “plants” and said these were rehashed, old charges.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/probe-if-theres-wrongdoing-says-congress-134468
01-09-2020||---||Modi govt destroying informal sector: Rahul||New Delhi, August 31Congress leader Rahul Gandhi today posted a video, alleging that the government was deliberately attacking the informal sector and the recent lockdown was one such calculated move.Gandhi said the aim was to enslave the poor who form the backbone of India’s informal economy. Demonetisation, flawed GST and lockdown were examples of how the government was undermining a whole sector, he said.He said India survived the 2008 recession due to a strong informal sector. “Till the time India’s informal sector is strong, no economic storm can touch it. The BJP government has been attacking the informal sector over the past six years. I am giving you three massive examples right now — demonetisation, wrong GST and lockdown. Don’t think the lockdown was unplanned. Don’t think it was done at the last minute. The aim of these three decisions was to destroy our informal sector,” he said.Gandhi argued that the PM needed the media and marketing to run the government. “The informal sector has a lot of money which the government can’t touch. They want to break this sector and extort this money from them. The effects of this attack on informal sector will be seen soon. The results will be that India won’t be able to produce jobs,” said Rahul.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-govt-destroying-informal-sector-rahul-134469

01-09-2020||KV Prasad||A quintessential politician cherished for his sagacity||Pranabda or Pranab babu, as Pranab Mukherjee was addressed by those who knew him, remained a quintessential politician whose enormous contribution both in the Congress party and the government remains invaluable.Read also: Ex-Prez Pranabda passes away at 84 For nearly 50 years, Mukherjee remained integral to politics, policy and processes that shaped the country from the time he became a member of the Indira Gandhi Cabinet in 1969 till 2012, when he consciously moved away following his election as the 13th President of India.Mukherjee held a unique distinction of having worked in three of the four important ministries on the Raisina Hill — Defence, Finance and External Affairs — and entered Rashtrapati Bhawan with decades of administrative experience.Former PM Indira Gandhi relied on Mukherjee’s acumen and trusted him to preside over Cabinet meetings in her absence. Yet, this proved politically expensive after her assassination. For when talks about a successor began, a theory of Mukherjee pushing the envelope swirled and the fallout was swift. He was out of the Congress during Rajiv Gandhi’s time. He floated the Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress, which he eventually merged with the parent party.Mukherjee’s career took off again in 1991 with PV Narasimha Rao rehabilitating him in the Planning Commission. Having spent decades in Parliament and as Leader of both Houses, Mukherjee had absolute understanding of the processes and was relied upon even during his stint in the Opposition. His political sagacity and commitment to Parliament was uniform both when he was in the government and Opposition.Mukherjee’s expertise to draft papers both for the party and government was phenomenal as was his memory. On any occasion, he could string events together, dipping into pages of history with reference years from memory. While Mukherjee wrote books of his years in public life, his diligently maintained diary with inner thoughts remain bequeathed with his daughter Sharmishta who may choose to make it public.One could knock and walk into his room. The knack of starting a conversation was to approach him with the sincerity of a student eager to learn and Pranabda would make everyone comfortable. The teacher in him was always there and a silly question would invite an immediate scold. His temper and outbursts mellowed after a serious road accident in 2007 but, as Congress president Sonia Gandhi remarked when he was declared the presidential candidate, “I will miss his tantrums”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-quintessential-politician-cherished-for-his-sagacity-134464
01-09-2020||New Delhi||India thwarts PLA bid, takes key heights||Fresh tensions have erupted between India and China, this time in the area between Thakung and Chushul along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China attempted to change the status quo at the LAC two days ago but was reportedly thwarted by the Indian Army.Read also: PLA at it againClash after Provocation by 400 PLA menOn Monday, in a counter operation, Indian troops of the secretive commando Special Frontier Force (SFF) occupied key mountain heights which China claims as its own. The SFF consists of soldiers recruited from the Tibetan community in India.One SFF officer was reportedly killed and at least two were injured in the operation. So far, the death has been attributed to a mine explosion.The first incident on August 29-30 night triggered by the PLA occurred on the southern side of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake, the Ministry of Defence said on Monday morning.The SFF action took place in two areas —- the south bank of Pangong Tso and Rezang La, which is further south of Chushul.Since May, clashes have taken place at the Galwan valley and north bank of Pangong Tso, making this the first such incident south of Pangong Tso. The area between Thakung and moving southwards towards Chushul is sensitive as a road runs almost parallel to the LAC for several kilometres. Thakung is an Indian military base located on the LAC. Chushul is an important base located 50 km south of Thakung.The MoD statement said: “The PLA carried out provocative military movements to change the status quo (at the LAC). Indian troops pre-empted this activity on the southern bank of Pangong Tso and undertook measures to strengthen our positions and thwart Chinese intentions to unilaterally change the facts on the ground”.Sources said the armies of the two sides had a physical clash as some 400 PLA soldiers attempted to change the status quo along the LAC. The PLA move has led to troop deployment at three fresh locations around ‘Black Top’, a mountain top just south of Thakung that is higher than 14,000 feet.A Brigade Commander-level flag meeting was conducted at Chushul along the LAC to resolve the issues, but the matter remains unsettled. On Monday, the PLA Western Theater Command accused India of “illegally crossing the line” on August 31 at two points.Rising tensionsIAF surveillance up as China deploys fighter jets||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-thwarts-pla-bid-takes-key-heights-134422

The group of eight—coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement and electricity—comprise 40.27 per cent of the index of industrial production. The fiscal deficit was also going out of hand. In April-June, it was at Rs 8.21 lakh crore because the total receipts were only Rs 2.32 lakh crore whereas the expenditure was Rs 10.54 lakh crore. Last year, the fiscal deficit for the same period was Rs 5.47 lakh crore.Subramanian sought to give an upbeat scenario by claiming that India was beginning to experience a V-shaped recovery. For instance, core sector growth had fallen to 38 per cent in April but the decline was progressively reduced to 22 per cent in May, 13 per cent in June and 9.6 per cent in July.The CEA also pointed out that railway freight in July was at 95 per cent of July 2019 levels and it was six per cent higher in the first 26 days of August this year compared to the same period last year. Similarly, e-way bills, which capture inter-state trade, in August have nearly climbed to last August’s levels.Meanwhile, investor wealth tumbled by Rs 4,55,914.68 crore following heavy selloff in the equity market where the BSE benchmark Sensex plummeted 839 points amid fresh India-China border tensions. Investors were also cautious ahead of the release of GDP data, traders said.After rallying 543 points in morning trade, the BSE Sensex surrendered all gains to close at 38,628.29, a decline of 2.13 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gdp-shrinks-24-expected-says-govt-134451

On the contrary, it is more derogatory to the reputation of this court and would amount to further scandalising and bringing administration of justice in disrepute, in which the common citizen of this country has faith,” the Bench said, adding the contemnor had indulged in making reckless allegations against the institution of justice. Hours later, Bhushan told reporters that he will “respectfully” pay the fine as he has “the greatest respect for judiciary”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-fines-bhushan-re-1-for-contempt-134454

And that is in Indian interest,” the minister said at a webinar organised by the US India Strategic Partnership Forum. Jaishankar twice mentioned “trust” with Indian talent as if to differentiate them from some migrants to the US who had been indicted for espionage and data theft. The minister was seeking freer immigration policies for “trusted” talent from his country against the backdrop of a severe squeeze on visa categories such as H-1B availed by tens of thousands of Indian every year.On observations from the US side that the Atmanirbhar Bharat policy had led to confusion among defence suppliers, the minister said: “Why should they be bought from abroad? This is a great opportunity for countries to invest in defence manufacturing. Terms have become more liberal. It is good for your business.”He also sought to dispel the impression that India was seeking a closer security relationship with the US as a hedge to China. “The partnership is not tailored to a particular situation or focused on a country. It is about the larger ability of India and the US to think alike in so many ways…to secure the world and make it a better place,” he said.To the American corporate leaders at the webinar, he described Atmanirbhar Bharat as a programme to increase national capacities, with manufacturing at its heart. “This will open up new business opportunities along with more liberal ownership norms for foreign investors. We are much more interested in global value chains passing through India and using Indian manufacturing capacity,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/allow-easy-visa-to-trusted-indians-jaishankar-tells-us-134462
