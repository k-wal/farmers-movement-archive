He also misbehaved with the woman at the hotel where they met, the official said.Tarai’s WhatsApp and phone records showed that he had numbers of several female police officers, the SDPO added.Preliminary investigation suggests he has cheated multiple individuals. A probe is on, police said.He has been booked under various Indian Penal Code sections, including 420 (cheating), 307 (attempt to murder), 354 (outraging modesty) and 506 (criminal intimidation, it added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fake-cop-cons-real-cop-of-rs-4-5-lakh-360714

In the current scenario we recommend three medicines for prophylaxis,” Ayush Ministry officials said today.These three medicines are Ayuraksha kit which consists of Chyawanprash 6 gm a day; Ayush kwath 75 ml (3gm powder boiled in 150 ml water and reduced to 75 ml) once a day; Samshamani vati 500 mg twice a day; Anu Taila once a day one to two drops nasal application in each nostril once a day.The second prophylaxis intervention in the Ayush guideline is Guduchi Ghan Vati 500 mg twice a day; third is Ashwagandha tablet 500 mg twice a day.The ministry said during the first wave, 19,000 Delhi police personnel were given Ashwagandha tablets and a peer reviewed research was published to show they were either not infected or did not progress to severe disease.For management, the ministry suggested AYUSH 64, a poly herbal formulation developed by the Central Council of Research in Ayurvedic Sciences along with CSIR. “Seven clinical studies were done and were found effective for management through AYUSH 64 of which 2 tablets of 500 mg twice a day are recommended for management of asymptomatic cases and 2 tablets of 500 mg thrice a day for mild to moderate Covid,” said the ministry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-advises-ayush-drugs-for-covid-prevention-management-360703
12-01-2022||Amaravati||AP govt creates parallel Mahila Police set up||The Andhra Pradesh government on Wednesday framed the AP Mahila Police (Subordinate Service) Rules, 2021, creating a parallel set up in the Police Department by organizing a separate cadre for women police.Called the Mahila Police, the new cadre will be organized in five ranks like Mahila Police, Senior Mahila Police, Assistant Sub-Inspector, Sub-Inspector and Inspector (Mahila Police), according to an order issued by in-charge Principal Secretary (Home) G Vijaya Kumar.The job chart for the Mahila Police says educating and creating awareness among people on social issues and propagating government schemes would be their main role.While the Mahila Police will be recruited directly by the respective district Superintendents of Police and Commissioners of Police, the other ranks will be on promotion based on qualification and eligibility during a particular selection year, the Government Order said.A dress code, with a separate logo, has been prescribed for different ranks of the Mahila Police, with only khaki colour being common with the regular police.The government has fixed a recognized graduate degree as the basic academic qualification for recruitment as Mahila Police and the maximum age limit has been set at 28 for general candidates.The new set of rules was brought in in the backdrop of an ongoing litigation in the High Court challenging the designation of the ‘Grama Mahila Samrakshana Karyadarsi/Ward Mahila Samrakshana Karyadarsi’ as ‘Mahila Police’, treating them as equal to lady constables.Close to 15,000 women were appointed by the district Collectors in the village and ward secretariats that were newly created by the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government in July 2019 and called women protection secretaries (WPS).Last month, the government informed the Andhra Pradesh High Court that it was withdrawing a GO designating the ‘Grama Mahila Samrakshana Karyadarsi/Ward Mahila Samrakshana Karyadarsi’ as ‘Mahila Police’, treating them as equal to lady constables.Accordingly, in the new rules, the government completely avoided referring the Mahila Police as lady constables.The new rules, the Government Order specified, were in supersession of all rules issued vide various orders in the years 2019 and 2021.The ‘Grama Mahila Samrakshana Karyadarsi/Ward Mahila Samrakshana Karyadarsi’ recruited as per the 2019 rules have now been “re-designated” as Mahila Police, irrespective of their fulfilling the eligibility criteria, particularly in terms of academic qualification and physical parameters.Henceforth, new recruits would have to undergo training for three months after submitting a security bond for Rs 5,000, stating they would “serve the Department after training for a minimum period of three years from the date of their actual appointment”.According to the new job chart prescribe under a separate Government Order on Wednesday, the Mahila Police will function “to curb violence against women and girls and report any untoward incident in the community”.“They will strive to encourage the community members to be responsible for creating a safe environment for women and girls and children. They shall create awareness among the targeted beneficiaries, pregnant women, lactating mothers, children, etc. about various government programmes,” the order said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ap-govt-creates-parallel-mahila-police-set-up-360702
12-01-2022||Bengaluru||Karnataka HC asks Congress to furnish permission taken for its ‘padayatra’||The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday asked the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) to submit before it by January 14 whether they had taken any permission to hold the ‘Walk for Water’ demanding a balancing reservoir across Cauvery river at Mekedatu in Ramanagara district.Hearing a petition, the division bench comprising Chief Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Suraj Govindaraj also directed the state government to submit before it on Friday how the permission was granted to the KPCC to hold the rally.The Bench asked the state government what measures were taken to restrain the KPCC from holding the rally. The court directed the Congress to explain whether they were adhering to Covid-19 norms such as wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing.The petition was filed by A V Nagendra Prasad through advocate Shridhar Prabhu.Following a surge in Covid-19 cases in the state, the Karnataka government had on January 4 banned protests, demonstrations and congregation of people.Yet, the Congress went ahead with its ‘padayatra’ (march) saying that the government was inflating the number of coronavirus cases, and alleging that it’s trying to scuttle the party’s programme.The Karnataka government said it will review the observations made by the court and initiate action accordingly.“The CM and I have noticed the observations made by the High Court on this issue. We have asked the Advocate General for details of the observations made by the court. We will study it and take a decision accordingly,” Karnataka Home Minister Araga Jnanendra told reporters.To a query on the measures taken, Jnanendra said many First Information Reports (FIRs) have been filed against those leading the padayatra.The minister said the High Court has given the government a day’s time during which the matter will be discussed and a decision taken accordingly.He was hopeful that the Congress, which was in power earlier and is the principal opposition party, will stop their march after receiving a “direction” from the Karnataka High Court.“The High Court has served a notice to the Congress party, which is a responsible opposition party, asking them whom did they seek permission from and why did they choose this time for their agitation. Hence, I feel that they will stop it (march),” Jnanendra said.Replying to a query on why the government did not stop the march at the beginning itself, the minister said, “Your statement that this march should have been stopped is also the opinion of people. There is public anger against the padayatra. We had given them warning also. Against this background, we will take action.”  Meanwhile, Karnataka Chief Secretary P Ravi Kumar held a meeting with Director General of Police Praveen Sood, Advocate General Prabhuling K Navadgi, and senior officials of various departments including home department regarding the government’s submission to the court on Friday for allowing the padayatra, sources told PTI.Reacting to the development, former chief minister Siddaramaiah, who along with Congress state president D K Shivakumar is spearheading the march, said he would honour the High Court order.“I am not aware what the court has said. I will wait for the court order. The matter is posted to January 14. We will obey the order,” Siddaramaiah said. He, however, said the padayatra would continue on Thursday as well.To a query that the court has asked the government how it allowed the padayatra to happen, Siddaramaiah said, “The question is to the government, not us.”  When asked whether the Congress took permission to hold demonstration, Siddaramaiah said demonstrations are always held without seeking permission. “We had informed the government about our agitation but we did not take permission,” he explained.BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel accused the Congress leadership of organising the padayatra with malafide intention of spreading Covid-19 among masses and jeopardise their lives.“The High Court has expressed its dissatisfaction over the event. If they have respect for the court and lives of people, they should immediately withdraw their agitation,” Kateel said in a statement.Alleging that the march has become a prestige issue for Shivakumar, MLA from Kanakapura constituency, Kateel accused the Congress of delaying the project unnecessarily.The Congress started its 10-day padayatra demanding implementation of the Mekedatu project across Cauvery river, despite Covid-19 restrictions, on January 9.Led by Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah, the padayatra with the theme ‘Namma Neeru Namma Hakku’ (Our water, Our right) began at the Sangama, the confluence of Cauvery and Arkavathi rivers at Kanakapura in Ramanagara district, and will be spanning a distance of nearly 139 km.Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai has accused the Congress of playing politics on the Mekedatu issue, instead of behaving like a responsible opposition. Further, alleging that the Congress did not put any efforts to take the project forward while in power, he reiterated that his government is committed to implement the project.The Congress’ march from Mekedatu to Bengaluru is scheduled to pass through Kanakapura, Ramanagara and Bidadi, before culminating at Basavanagudi in Bengaluru on January 19. It will be covering about 15 of the 224 Assembly constituencies in the state.Though the padayatra is being projected as apolitical by demanding the implementation of the Mekedatu project, it is also seen as Congress’ attempt to mobilise its cadres and consolidate its voter base in the old Mysuru region, which is a Vokkaliga bastion, where JD(S) is its traditional rival and the ruling BJP is attempting to make inroads ahead of the 2023 Assembly polls.Much is at stake for Shivakumar, the man behind this march, as several Congress functionaries believe that it is an attempt by the KPCC chief, ahead of the state elections, to assert his chief ministerial ambitions, for which Siddaramaiah is also a strong contender. The party has seen several incidents of political one-upmanship between the two leaders last year.The Karnataka government submitted a Detailed Project Report (DPR) to the Central Water Commission (CWC) in 2019, which was then referred to the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) where it is stuck currently as Tamil Nadu, which is the lower riparian state has opposed the project tooth and nail.Karnataka has maintained that the project within its territory will benefit both states as the surplus water stored can be managed between the two during the distress years, and its implementation will in no way affect the interests of Tamil Nadu’s farming communities, as there will be no impact on its share of water.While the neighbouring state is of the view that the project would “impound and divert” the uncontrolled water flow due to Tamil Nadu from Kabini sub-basin, the catchment area below Krishnarajasagara, and also from Shimsha, Arkavathi and Suvarnavathi sub-basins besides other small streams.The estimated Rs 9,000 crore Mekedatu multipurpose (drinking and power) project involves building a balancing reservoir near Kanakapura in Ramanagara district. The project once completed is aimed at ensuring drinking water to Bengaluru and neighbouring areas (4.75 TMC) and can also generate 400 megawatts of power. — PTIFormer Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah (C) with KPCC President D K Shivakumar (2L) and Congress MP D K Suresh (R), during the 3rd day of the 10-day padayatra from Mekedatu to Bengaluru to demand the implemention of Mekedatu water project, in Kanakapura, near Bengaluru, on January 11, 2022.

12-01-2022||New Delhi||Former Uttarakhand Congress chief Upadhyay sacked from party posts||Former Uttarakhand Congress president Kishor Upadhyay was on Wednesday sacked from all party posts for anti-party activities.Upadhyay, a former industry minister in the election-bound state, is said to have been in touch with the BJP and some other rival parties of the Congress in Uttarakhand.AICC in charge for Uttarakhand Devendra Yeah in a letter to Upadhyay accused him of holding parleys with other parties.”Despite multiple warnings given to you personally, your conduct of indulging in anti-party activity continues unabated. You are therefore removed from all party positions, pending further action in the matter,” Yadav said in his letter to Upadhyay.Yadav said the people of Uttarakhand were yearning for change and are waiting to throw out the “corrupt BJP government”.“There is widespread anger with the maladministration, misgovernance and all round corruption aided and abetted by the BJP leadership. It is the solemn duty of each one of us to rise to the challenge and serve the Devbhumi of Uttarakhand as also its people.Sadly, you have been hobnobbing with BJP and other political parties with a view to undermine this fight and weaken the cause of the people,” Yadav accused Upadhyay in a letter to him.The Congress just recently warded off a crisis in the state unit after placating former chief minister Harish Rawat who had taken to Twitter to say enough was enough.Rahul Gandhi had to step in to pacify Rawat who was told he would lead the campaign and the chief minister face would be decided after the elections.Rawat and other state leaders last week released the campaign song of the Congress in Uttarakhand titled “teen tigada kaam bigada” in a pun on the ruling BJP appointing three CMs in five years.Uttrakhand will vote in a single phase on February 14 with Punjab and Goa.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-uttarakhand-congress-chief-upadhyay-sacked-from-party-posts-360695

Ans: Both opened the bowling for Town Club, Vivekananda once taking 7 wickets in an innings. Incidentally, the man who started the club was Saradaranjan Ray, the grand uncle of Satyajit Ray,” Bhattacharjya wrote in tweet posted this morning.According to cricket writer Abhishek Mukherjee, Hemachandra Ghose, revolutionary freedom fighter, who was associated with Town Club (Kolkata), hadspotted a strapping youth when Town Club was having a practice session. Ghoshtrained him to bowl overarm. This boy, Narendranath Datta,who later became famous as Swami Vivekananda,took 7/20 against Calcutta Club, whose team members were Englishmen who lived in Kolkata then.This could be the first five-wicket haul in the history of club cricket in Kolkata, wrote Mukherjee, writer of the book “Sachin and Azhar at Cape Town: Indian and South African Cricket Through the Prism of a Partnership” (with a foreword by the popular cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle).Mukherjee posted on social media a clipping from a newspaper report of the match. The report says that the English cricketers were curious to know about the young Indian bowler. Hemchandra Ghosh told the curious Englishmen, “This young spark is our discovery. One day he will master your English game”.After a pause, Ghosh said, “He is Narendranath Dutta, comes from the Datta family of Simla” (Simla is the name of the Kolkata neighbourhood where the Datta family lived).In all likelihood, the match was played in 1881. Vivekananda was then 18 years of age. The clipping posted by Mukherjee, however, does not show the date of the issue of the publication or the name of the paper.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-birth-anniversary-cricket-fans-pay-tribute-to-vivekanandas-cricketing-feat-360686

Across the time period of analysis from May 2021 to now, the fully vaccinated population had between 90.2 pc and 97.5 per cent lower chance of getting hospitalised with Covid-19 compared to the unvaccinated. The message is clear – vaccinations are preventing severe disease and death,” health ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said today as India’s active cases soared to 9,55,319, daily cases touched 1,94,720 and case positivity rose sharply from 1.1 pc on December 30 to 11.05 pc.The health ministry further cited WHO advisories to say that while Omicron has a growth advantage over the Delta, clinical severity data from South Africa, UK, Canada and Denmark shows a reduced risk of hospitalisation compared to Delta.“Hospitalisations appear to be low but we need to be vigilant,” Member Health NITI Aayog VK Paul said cautioning against irrational use of medicines and recalling how over prescription of steroids in the second wave led to the mucormycosis epidemic.The guilt of over prescription in the second wave is still there, Paul said noting that paracetamol, gargles and steam and budesonide if cough persists for five days is enough along with good diet and rest to recover from mild Covid and Remdesivir is not be given at home under any condition.However, the ministry added that more data was needed to understand the clinical markers of severity from Omicron such as oxygen and mechanical ventilation use and deaths.Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization, however, appears to be substantially higher than that against symptomatic disease since the vaccines are disease modifying and not disease preventing, ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said.Worldwide 159 nations have reported 552191 Omicron cases and 115 deaths. In India, 28 states and UTs gave 4868 Omicron cases of which 1805 have recovered and 3061 are active. India has seen one death from Omicron.ICMR, meanwhile, assured plenty of testing capacity in India saying once the person is exposed to Covid virus, tests will detect the disease from the third day to the eighth day. Bhargava said India had a capacity to produce 18 lakh home antigen test kits a day with kits of seven manufacturers approved for use and detailed on ICMR website.On management, Bhargava said home quarantine was mandatory for all contacts of Covid positive people for 7 days although testing is needed only for high risk 60 plus contacts of lab confirmed patients and not all family members.Soon India will upscale the availability of Omisure kit for detection of Omicron, developed by TATA MD and validated by ICMR, he said. It will detect Omicron in 2-3 hours.Paul also said India was in a very good shape with regard to its testing ability.“The real concern is irrational use of medicines,” he noted, adding that there were some people on ventilators with Omicron also and caution is necessary.VACCINE STATUSVaccination – 1st dose given to 86.62 cr (92 pc adults); both doses to 64.16 cr (68 pc adults)Precaution dose (since Jan 10) to 18.86 lakh; 15-18 year old dose to 2.83 cr (38 pc).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/post-omicron-study-shows-78-low-infection-chance-in-fully-vaxed-360685

12-01-2022||Guwahati||25-years before US heart transplant with pig’s organ, Assam doctor had experimented with tragic outcome||Global recognition for a medical experiment to use a pig’s heart as a transplant in a human body, now being claimed by US surgeons could have been in an Assam doctor’s name 25 years ago had he submitted his findings for a crucial peer review and sought requisite permissions before his path-breaking operation.Dr Dhaniram Baruah, a man ‘ahead of his times’, had achieved the near-impossible in 1997 when he had “successfully” transplanted a pig’s heart and other organs into a person.However, his refusal to place his findings and procedures before scientific peer scrutiny cost him not only with lack of recognition but also an arrest after the patient in whom he fitted the pig’s heart died after seven days.“Dr Baruah perhaps thought ahead of his times, but he had to play by the rules of the game. People’s lives are at stake and one has to go through the correct process (of peer review and seeking of permissions before actual transplant),” Dr A Goswami, a leading cardiac consultant surgeon here, said speaking to PTI.He underlined that research on critical surgeries involving the heart takes years and is constantly evolving. A team from University of Maryland School of Medicine, near Washington DC on Monday said on Monday it had successfully transplanted a genetically modified pig heart into a 57-yer-old patient with terminal illness.“The US doctors who performed the procedure now have 25 years of more research to work on than Dr Baruah did,” Goswami pointed out.“Also, medical facilities in 1997 in Assam were primitive compared to the US of today. The process of preparing the heart to be transplanted is a novel process and Dr Baruah perhaps did not have optimal resources at his disposal,” he added.Dr Goswami stressed the need for proper review and documentation for any such critical procedures to be undertaken on human beings, an aspect in which Dr Baruah’s research and work lacked and deprived him of any official recognition.Baruah, an FRCS had transplanted the pig’s heart into a 32-year-old male patient who had a ventricular septal defect or hole in the heart in January 1997.The surgery, which took 15 hours to perform, seemed successful.However, the patient died of multiple infections seven days later, leading to accusation of insufficient research and lack of permission from authorities before taking up the surgery. Dr Baruah and two others involved were arrested for violating the organ transplantation act.Dr Raj Dutta, a consultant with Dispur Hospital here, said “research cannot be a stand-alone. It has to be corroborated”.“Peer review is crucial to ensure that the findings are of optimal benefit, without risk of leading to any harmful side-effects. Dr Baruah should have submitted his findings to review, which would have helped in knowing how much breakthrough he had actually achieved,” Dr Dutta added.A senior Guwahati-based journalist Mrinal Talukdar, who had covered the event and the brouhaha which arose when Dr Baruah had made his sensational claim of the successful transplant, said, “Our question as journalists was whether his findings were peer reviewed.

She will automatically qualify for it, provided she completes her graduation in the meantime,” Sarma stated.The chief minister exhorted the 24-year-old to set a shining example of equal dedication to her other responsibilities as well.Besides her monthly salary, Lovlina will be given additional Rs 1 lakh per month for her training expenses, he said.If it gets difficult for her to continue training at Patiala in Punjab, the state government might think of bringing an international-level coach for her to Guwahati, he promised.“We will also soon name a road in Guwahati after Lovlina,” Sarma said.Referring to enlistment of other sportspersons in the Assam Police since last year, in line with the state’s new policy, Sarma said sports should not be viewed as a co-curricular activity anymore.“Earlier, parents used to dissuade their children from pursuing sports after a certain age as there was no guarantee of a successful career even if someone excelled in a discipline. We want to change that. We want to prove that sports itself can be a career,” he asserted.Besides putting a thrust on recruitment of sportspersons in the Assam Police, the government is also working on increasing sports quota in other departments, Sarma pointed out.He said that priority was being given to construction of sport complexes in different parts of the state, including a Rs 25-crore stadium named after Lovlina in Sarupathar assembly constituency.“Coaching, training and talent identification are essential. The government is focussing on early talent identification and giving them scholarships to take such sportspersons forward,” the CM said.Sarma, who launched a crusade against the drug menace after assuming office in May last year, noted that sports can work as an alternative to engage youths and dissuade them from substance abuse.The CM said every police station has been asked to form own football and volleyball teams, which can then participate in district-level competitions.He urged upon the district administrations to ensure timely organisation of school-level sports competitions once the pandemic situation eases.Borgohain, in her brief speech on the occasion, said, “This is a memorable day for me as I am joining the Assam Police.” “I will give my best in the boxing ring and bring more glory to my state and people,” the Khel Ratna awardee added as her eyes welled up with tears.The pugilist scripted history last year by becoming the first sportsperson from Assam to win an Olympic medal. She clinched the bronze in the welter-weight category in last year’s Tokyo Games.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/sports/hope-lovlina-makes-it-to-ips-cadre-himanta-after-olympic-medallists-enlistment-in-assam-police-360669
12-01-2022||New Delhi||Weekly case positivity in 300 districts over 5%, don't treat Omicron as common cold: Centre||As many as 300 districts in India are reporting weekly Covid case positivity of more than 5 per cent, the Union government said on Wednesday as it urged people not to treat infection due to Omicron variant as common cold and get vaccinated.It said Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Gujarat are emerging as states of concern due to the rise in Covid cases there.Addressing a press conference, Joint Secretary in Health Ministry Lav Agarwal said a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections has been noted in India with the case positivity climbing to 11.05 per cent on Wednesday from 1.1 per cent on December 30.Concurrently, Covid cases have been rising globally with January 10 recording the highest ever single-day rise of 31.59 lakh cases worldwide, he said.The official said that currently, 300 districts in India are reporting weekly case positivity of more than 5 per cent.Informing the press conference that 19 states have over 10,000 active Covid cases, Agarwal said Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala and Gujarat are emerging as states of concern due to the rise in Covid cases there.Stressing on the importance of getting inoculated, he quoted the World Health Organisation to say that vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation appears to be substantially higher than against symptomatic Covid-19 disease.NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul said, “Omicron is not the common cold, cannot take it lightly. We need to be vigilant, get vaccinated and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.”“Vaccination is an important pillar in our Covid response programme,” he added.India added 1,94,720 new infections to its tally of Covid-19 cases pushing it to 3,60,70,510, according to the Union Health Ministry data on Wednesday.Active cases have increased to 9,55,319, the highest in 211 days, while the death toll has climbed to 4,84,655 with 442 fresh fatalities. Of the total 4,868 cases of the Omicron variant, 1,805 people have recovered or migrated so far.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-cases-have-been-rising-globally-with-january-10-recording-the-highest-ever-single-day-rise-of-31-59-lakh-cases-worldwide-360668
12-01-2022||Islamabad||Pakistan's new security policy seeks ‘peace' with India: Report||Pakistan is willing to make peace with immediate neighbours, including India, under its first-ever National Security Policy which leaves doors open for trade with New Delhi even without the settlement of the Kashmir issue provided there is headway in bilateral talks, according to a media report.The National Security Policy, separately endorsed by the National Security Committee and the Cabinet last month, is scheduled to be formally unveiled by Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday.Peace with immediate neighbours and economic diplomacy will be the central theme of Pakistan's foreign policy in the new National Security Policy, the Express Tribune newspaper reported on Tuesday.The five-year-policy document covering a period between 2022-26, is being propped up by the Pakistan government as the country's first-ever strategy paper of its kind that spells out the national security vision and guidelines for the attainment of those goals.The original 100-page policy, which would be kept under wraps, leaves the door open for trade and business ties with India without the final settlement of the longstanding Kashmir dispute provided there is progress in the talks between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, an official was quoted as saying by the paper."We are not seeking hostility with India for the next 100 years. The new policy seeks peace with immediate neighbours,” the official said on condition of anonymity.If there is a dialogue and progress, there would be a possibility of normalising trade and commercial ties with India as it had happened in the past, the official added.Ties between India and Pakistan nose-dived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in the neighbouring country. Subsequent attacks, including one on an Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The relationship dipped further after India's war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.The relations deteriorated after India announced withdrawing the special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of the state into two union territories in August, 2019.India has told Pakistan that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Islamabad in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence.As the new national security policy seeks a shift in Pakistan's approach from geo-strategic to geo-economics, there is a renewed optimism of a possible thaw with India, the report said."Economic security will be the central theme of the new national security policy," the official disclosed."But geo-economics does not necessarily mean we overlook our geo-strategic and geo-political interests,” the official said, adding the long-standing Kashmir dispute with India has been identified as a ‘vital national policy' issue for Pakistan.The official, however, clarified that there were no prospects of rapprochement with India under the current government in New Delhi.The official said this would be the first-ever codified national security policy that would cover both internal security as well as foreign policy."Only a part of the national security policy will be made public,” the official clarified, saying in the rest of the world such policies often remained classified.The official said though Pakistan did have defence, foreign and internal policies, the new policy would act as an “umbrella document” providing direction for the future.It took seven years to prepare this policy, which was started by then-national security adviser Sartaj Aziz in 2014."Inputs were taken from all the federal, provincial institutions as well as military and other departments,” the official said.The official said the Opposition was not taken on board since policy making was the domain of the executive but for a consensus, "we are ready to sit with the Opposition." However, the Opposition had boycotted the session when National Security Adviser Moeed Yusuf briefed the parliamentary committee on national security a few weeks ago.When asked to comment on the implementation of the policy, the official said the classified document lays out a complete implementation mechanism and the prime minister will review the progress on a monthly basis.The policy will be reviewed every year and at the time of change of government, the official said, adding the issue of political stability was also taken care of in it.Pakistan has a chequered history with no elected prime minister ever having been able to complete his/her five-year term.The new policy also deals with the issue of militant and dissident groups and advocates dialogue with ‘reconcilable elements.' On the internal front, the new policy identifies five key areas of population/migration, health, climate and water, food security and gender mainstreaming, according to the report. ---||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistans-new-security-policy-seeks-peace-with-india-report-360664
12-01-2022||Kochi||‘Vaccine nationalism’ could spawn new variants, warns medical expert||Attempts by developed nations to monopolise the production of coronavirus vaccines and hoard them, a phenomenon described as ‘vaccine nationalism’, could weaken the fight against the pandemic and lead to spawning of new virus variants with vaccine resistance, a leading medical expert has warned.This assumes significance in the wake of the massive spread of Omicron and detection of a new Covid-19 variant in France, temporarily named as ‘IHU’.“The narrow, self-centric, behaviour may not only turn out to be epidemiologically self-defeating and clinically counterproductive, but is also bound to prolong the pandemic by perpetuating the spread of the contagion in and across unprotected populations,” according to Prof (Dr) Yatish Agarwal, Vardhman Mahavir Medical College & Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi.If the majority of the world population goes unvaccinated, the toll taken by Covid-19 illness will continue to wreak havoc, Prof Agarwal writes in an article that appears in the Manorama Yearbook-2022.Making a strong pitch for equitable distribution of vaccines and speedy immunisation of people across the globe, he said the politicisation of vaccine distribution is proving counterproductive for democratic practices globally.Dr Agarwal argues that the practice betrays ‘a crass moral failure’ in the backdrop of WHO’s declaration of ‘Health for All’.Vaccine nationalism, spurred by the market approach, may snowball into a situation which could go horribly wrong.“In such a setting, the virus is bound to grow and multiply and spawn new virus mutations. These new avatars of coronaviruses may lead to vaccine resistance, and precipitate a fresh threat to the human race,” writes Dr Agarwal.Given the small scale of vaccine production, extending vaccine protection to the entire global population is no mean task, according to him.“The challenge deepens, given that most vaccines require at least two jabs to instil a primary protection, and very possibly, one or more subsequent booster shots to keep up the immunity.” Dr Agarwal, who is also Dean, University School of Medicine, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, New Delhi, says the rich nations with their economic strength and vastly superior scientific and pharmaceutical capabilities have forced an unequal run on the coronavirus vaccine supply, and left little or no provisions for the citizens of the third world.A small contingent of wealthy nations — Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, USA and the European Union — through investments in vaccine manufacturing and advance purchase agreements, secured nearly half of the planned 2021 supplies of the leading vaccine candidates, says Dr Agarwal.“Together, these countries account for just 14 percent of the global population. Still, by making advance market commitments, they collectively reserved nearly five billion vaccine doses,” he points out.The US has entered into at least six bilateral deals, totaling more than one billion doses – more than enough to inoculate the entire American population. The European Union, Britain and Canada have each entered into seven bilateral deals, with the potential of securing enough doses to cover their populations two, four, and six times over, respectively.Dr Agarwal says the compulsions of the electoral politics of democratic governments in developed countries are understandable as they need to win the approval of their own people by prioritising their health over those of all others.However, these nations must strike a fine balance to share stockpiles of vaccines, waive patent protections, relax export controls on ingredients used for vaccine production, and reduce vaccine costs for poor countries.Making a strong case for building a diplomacy-based international political clout, he suggests tailoring a ‘vaccine continuum’ as an imperative that would reflect the global will to stymie the pandemic and secure the health and well-being of human race.“Eradicating Covid-19 requires nothing less than a universal vision and global leadership. The benefits of vaccination must percolate across large parts of the world if human populations have to develop herd immunity and call a stop to the deadly play of the virus,” argues Dr Agarwal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccine-nationalism-could-spawn-new-variants-warns-medical-expert-360661

We have arrested them on Tuesday evening," a senior police official said.Investigation revealed that the accused colluded to get the documents like sponsor certificate, identity card and residential certificate for the visas for Pakistan citizens willing to come to India, police said.For the attestation, they fabricated the signature of a teacher Gautam Puri, the police said.  "During investigation, we found that Puri had no idea about this attestation in his name and he was not aware of his name being used in fabrication of documents for this purpose”, said the officer associated with the investigation adding that a third class teacher does not fall into the category of a gazetted officer, thus ineligible for such attestations.Of the four accused, Sohel and Chiranjiv worked as a typist in the High Court premises here and had charged Rs 500 for preparing forged documents for 11 Pak citizens so far, the officer said.Sohle and Chirinjiv are relatives and were working as agents to prepare Visas for willing Pakistani citizens.  As per the procedure, a Pakistan citizen has to submit his documents to the Indian High commission in Pakistan for a visa for India. For this, there is the requirement of a sponsor or guarantor from India. This sponsor certificate has to be attested by a gazetted officer. This certificate is then annexed with the visa documents to obtain a visa for India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/four-nabbed-in-jodhpur-for-preparing-forged-documents-for-pak-immigrants-360643

The Indians are innovating and collaborating to find solutions and writing the code of global prosperity. They are ruling the roost in the world of unicorns. India is entering the golden age of the startup world. The mantra of new India is compete and conquer,” said the PM, citing the Indian achievements in the recent paralympics and terming them as a never-before event.The PM also hailed the adolescents for vaccine acceptance saying over 2 crore children aged 15 to 18 had been vaccinated already. “Today’s children show the resolve for duty. Our 15 to 18 year olds have shown a tremendous sense of responsibility by quickly getting vaccinated,” said the PM.He added that the government bill to raise the age of marriage for women to 21 years on par with boys is a step towards equality.“Boys and girls are equal. The raising of the legal age of marriage will help girls build a career and get space,” the PM said, adding that the world today is looking at India with hope and trust because India is the youngest country in the world – young in enterprise, in dreams, in thoughts and in awakening.Saluting the sacrifices by Sahibzadas, the sons of Guru Gobind Singh; of Bhagat Singh and Netaji Subhas Chander Bose for the freedom of India, the PM said, “Bharat ki toh pracheenta mein bhi naveenta hai (there is modernity even in India’s ancient history).”Hailing Indian youth, the PM said they would surely carve the path of happiness and security for the country.“The world agrees that India today has two major powers – demography and democracy. The nation's strength is directly proportional to its youth power. India’s youth not only have a demographic dividend, they also have democratic values. India considers its youth the drivers of development,” said the PM, adding that the Indian youth were leading development and democratic values.“What India says today, the world considers the voice of tomorrow. India's dreams mirror the dreams of the world. Today's youth have to live for the country and fulfil the dreams of freedom fighters,” said the PM exhorting youngsters to resolve for a better India.Quoting Sri Aurobindo, the PM said a brave, clean-hearted and aspiring youth is the only foundation on which a future nation can be built.“Sri Aurobindo's remarks should serve as a life lesson for 21st century youth. Today as the world’s youngest nation we are at a crossroads. This is a crossroads of new dreams and resolutions. Youth’s strength can steer India to new heights,” the PM said, adding that the government is attempting to create space for the youth, minimise its interference and support enterprise.The PM also urged everyone to think about being vocal for local when buying products.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/compete-and-conquer-is-the-mantra-of-new-india-pm-360641
12-01-2022||New Delhi||Covid hospitalisation rate has stabilised, current wave may have peaked: Delhi health minister||Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain on Wednesday said the number of hospital admissions in the national capital due to Covid has stabilised over the last five days, which is an indication that the current wave of the pandemic may have peaked and cases may decline in two-three days.While sharing that Delhi is expected to report 25,000 cases on Wednesday, he said it is difficult to conclude if a wave has peaked by looking at the positivity rate or the number of cases. Hospital admission rate is the major indicator, he said in response to a question.“We have observed that the number of hospital admissions has stabilised in the last four to five days and only 2,200 beds are occupied and 85 per cent of the beds are vacant,” the minister told reporters.“Plateauing of hospital admissions is an indication that the wave may have peaked. We may see a decline in cases in two to three days,” he said.Cases have started declining in Mumbai and Delhi is likely to follow the same trend, Jain added.He also assured that if cases come down in the next couple of days, restrictions would be lifted.The minister added that most of those who have died in the ongoing surge of infections had comorbidities and very few deaths had taken place due to coronavirus."People with comorbidities are facing more problems, not many people are coming to hospital for treatment of coronavirus," he said.The national capital had reported 23 fatalities on Tuesday. It has already recorded 93 fatalities in the first 11 days of the month.It had logged 54 fatalities in the last five months - nine in December, seven in November, four in October, five in September and 29 in August. In July, the virus had claimed 76 lives in the national capital.The health minister also welcomed the Centre's new guidelines for Covid testing, saying asymptomatic cases do not need to get tested.“The presence of virus in the human body is not a matter of concern until symptoms emerge,” he said.He said “very few” children are contracting the infection, and only those having pre-existing problems may need hospitalisation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-cases-have-stabilised-in-delhi-possibility-of-infections-coming-down-satyendra-jain-360625

All #HumanRights of minorities need to be fully & equally protected,” Varennes said in a tweet on Tuesday.Delhi Police last week arrested Aumkareshwar Thakur, 26, who is believed to be the creator of ‘Sulli Deals’ app from Madhya Pradesh's Indore, the first arrest made in the case.Hundreds of Muslim women were listed for “auction” on the mobile application with photographs sourced without permission and doctored.The accused, a Bachelor of Computer Application degree holder, admitted that he was a member of a group on Twitter and the idea to defame and troll Muslim women was shared there."He admitted that he had developed the code/app on GitHub. After the uproar regarding the Sulli Deals app, he had deleted all his social media footprints," a senior police officer said.In a separate ‘Bulli Bai’ case, Delhi Police on January 1 registered an FIR in connection with an online complaint submitted by a city-based woman journalist against unidentified persons for allegedly uploading her doctored picture on a portal.The case pertains to the creation of the 'Bulli Bai' app, which targeted Muslim women by putting up their images online for "auction".According to Delhi Police, Niraj Bishnoi, 21, who was arrested from Assam, was the alleged mastermind and creator of the ‘Bulli Bai’ application.He had disclosed during interrogation that he was in touch with the person behind the Twitter handle @sullideals, the alleged creator of the ‘Sulli Deals’ app that was hosted on GitHub in July last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sulli-deals-form-of-hate-speech-in-india-must-be-condemned-un-official-360614

I am a staunch feminist ally and I assure you there was no gender implied in my tweet and certainly no intent to attack you as a woman.“I hope we can put this behind us and that you will accept my letter. You will always be my Champion.

Also, foreign companies can ‘make for the world’ or export the India-produced equipment.The MoD is now coming up with a policy framework to decide which items can be imported and why. It is called the “Defence Production and Export Promotion Policy”. The upcoming policy will also lay down items that can be exported to friendly countries.As the policy gets finalised, the ministry will review the existing programmes that are listed for import — termed as “buy global category” under the MoD acquisition procedure. The review will provide list of items that cannot be imported and can be made within India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/make-in-india-the-focus-mod-plans-to-allow-only-few-imports-360491

12-01-2022||---||UP Assembly polls 2022: BJP set to release first list around Makar Sankranti||New Delhi, January 11The ruling BJP is expected to announce its first list of candidates for the Uttar Pradesh elections around Makar Sankranti (January 14), even as BSP supremo Mayawati is yet to reveal her cards.The BSP is expected to field quite a few Muslims, especially in segments where the community’s hold is strong. This will only work to the advantage of the BJP as the Opposition, including its chief rival Samajwadi Party, the Congress and the AIMIM, is also eyeing this crucial vote bloc.The BSP has “finalised” names on the majority of seats and also “intimated the selected candidates”, sources say.The BJP, which convened a meeting of its state election committee on Monday, held discussions on the first three phases of the elections, which will cover western UP, Rohilkhand, Braj and the Yadav-dominated belt of Etawah, Mainpuri and Bundelkhand.The sources say the state unit forwarded feedback received from the grass-root level to the central leadership for final approval.Though the BJP wants to announce a majority of candidates as soon as possible, there are some seats on which it needs to tread cautiously, especially the ones where key rival Samajwadi Party has an upper hand.This is where the BSP and its vote share comes in.The BSP has not allied with any party and is contesting all 403 seats alone. With a “declining” vote share projection, it is projected to win eight to 16 seats only. However, with a dedicated vote share, it has the potential to spoil the chances of many.In 2007, the minority community had voted largely for the BSP. And in 2012, it had voted for the SP. In the last elections, the Muslim vote got split among the SP-Congress combine, the BSP and the Peace Party, benefiting the BJP.Mayawati won’t contest: BSP leaderNew Delhi: BSP general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra on Tuesday said party president Mayawati would not contest the upcoming UP elections. He said he would also not be contesting. Former UP Chief Minister Mayawati is neither an MLA nor an MP, and has decided to put up candidates on all 403 Assembly segments in the state. The BSP had won 19 seats in the 2017 poll.

And we’re concerned by the China’s attempt to intimidate its neighbours. We’ll continue to stand with our partners,” Psaki asserted. India and the US are strategic partners.Sources in India said they looked forward to a “constructive” dialogue with China. Beijing, however, said the current situation in the border areas with India was “stable”, but it sort of apportioned the blame on India.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said, “China hopes that India will help the situation move from an emergency mode to a regular daily based management phase.” India has maintained that military deployments were done due to China’s attempt to unilaterally alter the LAC. Wang said: “At present, the situation in the border areas is stable on the whole and the two sides are in dialogue and communication through diplomatic and military channels.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-intimidating-neighbours-says-us-360469

He cited “grave oppression” of Dalits, OBCs, farmers, unemployed and small businessmen” under CM Yogi Adityanath as the reason behind his resignation. Soon after, the three MLAs, Roshan Lal Verma (Shahjahanpur), Brijesh Prajapati (Tindwari) and Bhagwati Sagar (Bilhaur), quit the BJP in “Maurya’s support”.Though the Samajwadi Party tweeted a photo showing its president Akhilesh Yadav welcoming Maurya and Verma into the party, the minister’s daughter and BJP’s Badaun MP Sanghamitra Maurya claimed her father was yet to join any party. He had quit the BJP and would reveal his strategy soon, she maintained.Sources said the next 48 hours were crucial for the BJP as more ministers and MLAs could quit the party. “Maurya is trying to influence other ministers and MLAs. Leaders have been tasked to talk to them,” said sources. BJP leaders, however, said a majority of those threatening to quit were the ones who knew they would be dropped on the basis of their performance. “Over 25 per cent of the MLAs may be denied the ticket. As far as Maurya is concerned, he was kept out of key decision-making committees as the leadership was aware this (resignation) was coming,” they said.Union Minister Amit Shah had a detailed discussion with Maurya during his last visit to UP as the latter was seeking “25-30 tickets for his supporters”, the leaders said. The defection comes as a shot in the arm for Akhilesh, who is trying to project himself as the leader of all backward communities. He has been actively wooing non-Yadav OBCs, who comprise 35 per cent of the total OBC population in the state, by stitching alliances with smaller caste-based parties. “There will be social justice and change in 2022,” Akhilesh said while welcoming Maurya into the SP. Before he joined the BJP, Maurya (68) was considered close to BSP chief Mayawati. Alleging auctioning of party ticket, he had left the BSP before 2017 Assembly polls.Was expected: BJP4 from Punjab join BJP‘Dalits, OBCs being ignored’Because of the grave oppression of Dalits, OBCs, farmers, unemployed and small businessmen, I am resigning. — Swami Prasad Maurya, former minister||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/setback-for-bjp-in-up-as-minister-three-mlas-resign-likely-to-join-sp-360444

12-01-2022||Kolkata||Health experts fear Gangasagar will be a 'super-spreader'||Health experts warned once again that allowing the Gangasagar Mela, a religious gathering in Sagar islands, at a time when the country is in the throes of a third Covid-19 wave could turn out to be a super -spreader 'incident.Experts warned that the Mela, akin to the Kumbh Mela held at Haridwar and Prayag among other places, which is slated to attract several lakhs of people could transform into a "hot source of transmission of the coronavirus"."It (Gangasagar Mela) will definitely be a super-spreader. There is no doubt of that. Lakhs of people will congregate and we fear there will be violation of Covid-19 safety protocol.""This will definitely boost the transmissibility of the virus. This Mela will definitely be a hot source of transmission (of the coronavirus). The number of daily cases will be much more than what we are seeing now," Dr Anima Halder, principal of state-run Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General (ID&BG) Hospital, told PTI. In the last seven days, the state has witnessed a massive surge in Covid-19 infections with the positivity rate shooting to 37 per cent. West Bengal reported over 24,287 infections on Sunday, the highest since the pandemic began.Halder pointed out that the Mela will give an opportunity to asymptomatic infected people to "mix with those yet not infected" in large numbers and that could help the virus spread in geometric progression.A doctors' forum had filed a writ petition before the Calcutta High Court seeking a ban on the gathering. The petitioners had sought a direction to the state government not to hold the annual Gangasagar mela scheduled for January 8 to January 16 on the occasion of Makar Sankranti at Sagar Island, situated about 130 km from Kolkata.However, the high court allowed the Mela to proceed on assurances from the state government that it would take steps to enforce Covid protocols and after ordering that the island be declared a notified areas, a committee be set up to monitor the measures taken, and to ensure that only double vaccinated people who have had RT-PCR Covid tests done 72 hours before reaching Sagar are allowed.Echoing Dr Halder's apprehensions, Dr Hiralal Konar, one of the conveners of the West Bengal Joint Platform of Doctors, said that there is a very strong possibility of the situation going out of hand and warned the healthcare infrastructure would be severely challenged if that happens. "Though, we know that the Omicron variant is not as fatal as previous strains, the rate of transmissibility will definitely cause havoc after the congregation has taken place at Sagar Island. This will definitely be a severe challenge to the health infrastructure," Dr Konar told PTI.Dr Shanta Dutta, director of the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, also reiterated the same fear stating that controlling people and making them follow safety protocols is a tough task in such a big gathering."Distancing while taking the dip? That will not be possible. So, it will definitely pave the way for the virus to transmit more and more," Dr Dutta told PTI.When contacted, Dr Subhrojyoti Bhowmick, Clinical Director, Academics and Research, Peerless Hospital, said, "Yes, I believe that gatherings like Gangasagar Mela are super spreaders and will add fuel to the fire of Covid19 surge.

12-01-2022||Vibha Sharma||Uttar Pradesh:  After Swami Prasad Maurya, three more MLAs quit BJP||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 11In a major setback to the ruling BJP in Uttar Pradesh, top OBC leader and state minister Swami Prasad Maurya on Tuesday resigned from the Cabinet of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath alleging “grave oppression of Dalits, OBCs, farmers, unemployed and small businessmen” under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and joined Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party.Soon thereafter three more MLAs, Roshan Lal Verma (Shahjahanpur), Brijesh Prajapati (Tindwari) and Bhagwati Sagar (Bilhaur), also tendered their resignations.   Sources, in fact, say the next 48 hours (or till the time the official candidate list is announced) are crucial for the ruling BJP as more sitting MLAs may follow suit, a development that may negatively impact the party trying to return on the basis of planks like “development, law and order, social equality” during its rule.BJP jolted on UP poll eve: Cabinet minister Swami Prasad Maurya quits, joins SPSome of those threatening to leave are also believed to be ministers in the Adityanath government. “Maurya is trying to influence other ministers and MLAs”, sources say, adding that state leaders have been tasked to “talk to them”. Though according to BJP leaders, the majority of those “threatening to leave are the ones who know they are being dropped/replaced on the basis of their performance”.“More than 25 per cent of the sitting MLAs are likely to be dropped. So far as Swami Prasad Maurya is concerned, he was kept out of important decision-making committees, meaning that the leadership was aware and this (resignation) was expected,” they say.Home Minister Amit Shah also had a “detailed talk with him during his last visit to UP”, they say, claiming that Maurya was asking for “25-30 tickets for his supporters”.However, coming just a couple of days before the poll-plan for the first phase gets rolling, Maurya’s exit is an embarrassment for the BJP which is trying to build its case among other backward classes (largely non-Yadav OBCs) and Dalits.Announcing his resignation Maurya said, “Despite a divergent ideology, I worked with dedication in the Yogi Adityanath cabinet. But because of the grave oppression of Dalits, OBCs, farmers, unemployed and small businessmen, I am resigning”. After resigning, he said, “Ab pata chalega, Swami Prasad Maurya kaun hai. Main jahan rahunga wahan sarkar banegi (now it will be known that who is Swami Prasad. The next government will be formed wherever I am)”.An OBC strongman, Maurya served as Minister of Labour, Employment and Coordination in the Adityanath’s cabinet.The defection comes as a shot in the arm for Akhilesh Yadav who is trying to project himself as the leader of all backward communities.Akhilesh Yadav has been actively wooing non-Yadav OBCs, who constitute 35% of the OBC population in the state by stitching alliances with smaller caste-based parties like the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), the Janwadi Socialist party (JSP) and the Mahan Dal, and resolving issues with uncle Shivpal Yadav.“Saamajik nyay ka inqalab hoga, baees me badlav hoga (There will be social justice and change in 2022),” said Akhilesh, welcoming Maurya.Interestingly, before he joined the BJP, the 68-year-old Maurya was considered a confidant of BSP chief Mayawati. He left the BSP, alleging “auctioning” of party tickets before the 2017 Assembly elections. Though according to BSP leaders, Maurya jumped ship after Mayawati declined to concede to his demand of tickets for his supporters and family members.   He is a five-time MLA from Padrauna, while his daughter Sanghmitra Maurya is a BJP MP from Badaun in the Lok Sabha.Maurya's daughter and BJP's Badaun MP Sanghamitra Maurya, however, claimed that her father has not joined any party and will reveal his strategy in a couple of days.The Samajwadi Party tweeted a photo of Maurya and Verma with Akhilesh Yadav, welcoming them in the party Sanghamitra said while that her father has resigned, he has not joined Samajwadi Party or any other political party yet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttar-pradesh-the-next-48-hours-crucial-for-bjp-as-cabinet-minister-swami-prasad-maurya-resigns-360332
12-01-2022||New Delhi||BJP jolted on UP poll eve: Cabinet minister Swami Prasad Maurya quits, joins SP||In a severe pre-election setback to the ruling BJP in Uttar Pradesh, state minister and senior leader Swami Prasad Maurya resigned from the cabinet and joined the Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party.Uttar Pradesh: After Swami Prasad Maurya, three more MLAs quit BJPIn a Twitter post, Maurya, a tall OBC leader representing the numerically dominant Kushwahas, Maurya said on Tuesday that he tried his best to work for the welfare of people in UP despite ideological differences with the BJP.“But I am now resigning from the UP cabinet in the wake of severe discrimination and neglect of the poor, farmers, marginalised, unemployed in the state,” Maurya said in his resignation letter to Governor Anandi Ben Patel.Maurya’s exit days ahead of seven-phase state election starting February 10 spell trouble for the BJP which seeks to appeal to all other backward classes.For the SP on the other hand Maurya is a great catch as it would help bolster SP’s image as a party with space for all OBCs and not Yadavs alone.Maurya’s entry will help SP reach out to Kushwahas, a dominant OBC caste in the state. SP does not have any tall Kushwaha leader in its fold.In Etawah, Mainpuri, Kannauj, and Badaun Mauryas—prestige segments for SP—are second numerically only to Yadavs.Maurya was earlier been the leader of opposition in the state assembly as a BSP MLA. He had quit for BJP ahead of the 2017 state polls after Mayawati declined to field three members of his family on polls—him, his son, and daughter.Swami Prasad Maurya contested and won from Padrauna on a BJP ticket in 2017 and was rewarded with a cabinet berth.He was the Minister of Labour, Employment, and Coordination in Uttar Pradesh.“Saamajik nyay kaa inqalab hoga, baaes me badlav hoga (There will be a revolution in the field, or social justice and there will be change in UP),” said Akhilesh welcoming Maurya on Tuesday.Maurya had quit the BSP in 2016 accusing Mayawati of betraying Dalits and auditioning party tickets.Maurya in SP fits the party’s plan to expand its OBC base beyond Yadavs. Earlier, Beni Prasad Verma, a Kurmi leader, had joined the SP.With its alliance also spanning the RLD, Aklihesh led SP is seeking to strengthen caste outreach ahead of a critical poll battle.UP polls are critical for the ruling BJP, which is defending 325 seats in an assembly of 403.SP had won 47 seats in 2017, BSP 19 and Congress 7.SP has allied with RLD and smaller parties this time to challenge the incumbents.दलितों, पिछड़ों, किसानों, बेरोजगार नौजवानों एवं छोटे-लघु एवं मध्यम श्रेणी के व्यापारियों की घोर उपेक्षात्मक रवैये के कारण उत्तर प्रदेश के योगी मंत्रिमंडल से इस्तीफा देता हूं। pic.twitter.com/ubw4oKMK7t||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-jolted-on-up-poll-eve-cabinet-minister-swami-prasad-maurya-quits-joins-sp-360325
