16-01-2022||Vibha Sharma||Amit Shah likely to hit campaign trail in UP after January 22: Sources||New Delhi, January 16Home Minister Amit Shah is expected to begin his tour of the poll-bound Uttar Pradesh from next week around January 22, a top BJP leader on Sunday said, exuding confidence of a “clear result” and “at least 300 of the 403 Assembly constituencies” for the party in the upcoming seven-phase elections in the state.“The people have made up their mind (on who to elect). In the first two phases (the candidates of which were declared yesterday), the BJP will win around 83 seats like the last time. The people of Uttar Pradesh have given a clear majority in the past elections. This time also they will give a clear majority,” the senior leader said in an informal interaction a day after the party declared its first list of 107 candidates for the key state.Shah is expected to begin his tour after Saturday and hold meetings, including with organisational leaders, and cover the entire stretch of Uttar Pradesh, the senior leader said, adding that the first two phases are crucial as the momentum generated there will carry forward in the remaining five phases.Dismissing any adverse effect on BJP’s fortunes due to the exit of OBC leader Swami Prasad Maurya and others, he said Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath gave “OBCs, in fact all castes, due representation in his Cabinet and also made Keshav Prasad Maurya his deputy”.“The BJP gave Mauryas and all communities due representation in the UP,” he said. “Those leaving will not make any difference to the party as issues raised by them are wrong. Neither reservation of any backward has been stopped nor any issue related to reservation is pending,” he said.Regarding allegations that the BJP was anti-backward castes, the leader said those leaving essentially claim to represent their castes and what may have prompted their resignation is that the party has been successful in winning over these communities, leading to their own marginalisation.“The representation backward castes like Maurya, Saini or Nunia have received in the organisation and the government is there for all to see…the Samajwadi Party had never given these communities any position. Whatever these defectors say, these communities have no reason to not support the BJP,” he added.The leader said tickets have been given to those who guarantee the party’s victory.With several party leaders seeking tickets for their kin, he said any relation of a party member who is already holding an elected position like an MP or MLA is unlikely to be fielded.However, this rule will not apply to those who are already MLAs.“Any sitting MP will not be made to contest the Assembly elections. There is also no possibility of giving two Assembly tickets to one family,” he said.On whether Akhilesh Yadav’s sister-in-law Aparna Yadav will join the BJP, he said she may but “the BJP will not give seat on her request”.Terming Ayodhya an important issue for the BJP, he said the name of the candidate will be decided by the party. Regarding CM Adityanath being feiled from Gorakhpur (urban), he said “all senior leaders in BJP decide their own seats”.The Election Commission has extended the ban on public meetings and roadshows till January 22.The BJP says even if the ban remains in place, the EC has allowed indoor meetings under certain conditions, sources said.“The Yogi Adityanath-led government’s performance on the issue of law and order and corruption, besides the welfare programmes of the Modi government at the Centre, will win people’s support,” the leader said.SP president Akhilesh Yadav has been targeting the saffron party over the alleged non-performance of Yogi Adityanath government and is trying to broaden base by inducting leaders from rival parties.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-shah-likely-to-hit-campaign-trail-in-up-after-january-22-sources-361830

Bengal means Business,” Rabbani posted on the microblogging platform as reply to Musk’s January 13 tweet.Drop here, we in West Bengal have best infra & our leader @MamataOfficial has got the vision.Bengal means Business … https://t.co/CXtx4Oq7y5Tatas, which had set its sights in Singur for a small car factory, was forced to pull out of Bengal in 2008 following a massive agitation led by the TMC over forcible land acquisition for the project.Mocking Rabbani, BJP’s IT cell in-charge Amit Malviya sought to remind him of the state’s past records.“You might think it is a joke. But it isn’t! West Bengal’s minister in charge for Minority Affairs and Madrasa Education has made an offer to Elon Musk to come invest in WB. His pitch will start with Mamata Banerjee’s record on post poll violence and end with Singur agitation?” Malviya tweeted.You might think it is a joke.

It is even more baffling for us that the tableau was rejected without assigning any reasons or justifications,” Banerjee said in a two-page letter to Modi. The proposed tableau was set to commemorate the contributions of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and his INA on his 125th birth anniversary year, the CM said. “I may like to inform you that all the people of West Bengal are deeply pained by this attitude of the central government. It is shocking to find that the contribution of its valiant freedom fighters finds no place in the nation’s ceremony to celebrate the occasion of Republic Day on the 75th year of our Independence. “I urge you to reconsider the decision and include the tableau of freedom fighters from West Bengal in the Republic Day parade on the 75th year of our Independence,” Banerjee added.                                     #controversy                                     #MamataBanerjee                                     #NarendraModi                                     #Netaji                                     #RDayrow                                     #Republicday                                     #tableau||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shocked-by-centres-move-to-reject-bengal-tableau-from-r-day-parade-mamata-banerjee-writes-to-narendra-modi-361806
16-01-2022||New Delhi||When Robert Clive named Calcutta one of ‘most wicked places’||Colonial administrator Robert Clive once compared the ancient city Gomorrah, notorious for vice and depravity, to Calcutta and dubbed the then capital of British India as “one of the most wicked places in the universe”.Clive, who was the first governor of Bengal Presidency under the East India Company in the 18th century, earned the title “Clive of India” as he played a key role in establishing Britain’s colonial domination over India.In July 1765, in a letter to East India Company official Sir Francis Sykes, Clive compared Gomorrah favourably to Calcutta.“I will pronounce Calcutta to be one of the most wicked places in the Universe. Corruption licentiousness and a want of principle seem to have possessed the minds of all the civil servants, by frequent bad examples they are grown callous, rapacious and luxurious beyond conception,” the letter says.This anecdote has been shared by BJP MP MJ Akbar in his new book ‘Doolally Sahib and the Black Zamindar: Racism and Revenge in the British Raj’, a chronicle of racial relations between Indians and their last foreign invaders.The author says on his return from England in May 1765, the first decision Clive made was to curb ‘gifts’, a euphemism for rampant corruption.“All presents between 1,000 and 4,000 now required permission—anything above that went into Company coffers. This shocked and infuriated Company officials, who believed that they needed 3,000 pounds a year to maintain their lifestyle, and thrice that amount to take back as retirement benefits, at a time when the salary of a member of the governor’s council was 330 pounds.”“The historian Percival Spear, using florid metaphors appropriate to colourful larceny, writes: ‘The brotherhood of exploitation, the freemasonry of graft, had been violated. Clive had put himself outside the pale. They sharpened their mental knives of revenge on the grindstone of hate while dipping their quills of complaint in the ink of defamation’,” the book says.Published by Bloomsbury India, the book draws upon the letters, memoirs and journals of traders, travellers, bureaucrats, officials, officers and the occasional bishop.A multitude of vignettes, combined with insight and analysis, reveal the deeply ingrained conviction of ‘white superiority’ that shaped this history.So who is Doolally?According to the book, ‘Doolally’ derives from Deolali, a transit camp situated in Nashik about a 100 miles from Bombay and referred to the feverish Doolally Sahib and the Black Zamindar eccentricity of the English soldier waiting to go home.Among many other interesting bits of information, Akbar writes about one of Mahatma Gandhi’s less-known talents—his ability to use laughter as a piquant missile in the armoury of non-violence. “During his visit to England in 1931 for the second Round Table Conference, Gandhi was asked by journalists what he thought of Western civilization. It would be a good idea, the Mahatma replied,” he writes.“The quip must have been especially pungent for Winston Churchill, still an intermittently successful provocateur rather than the icon he would become. Churchill, the eternal imperialist, had famously dismissed Gandhi as a ‘malignant subversive fanatic’ and seditious lawyer ‘now posing as a fakir of a type well-known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Viceregal Palace’, after Gandhi’s pact with the Viceroy Lord Irwin in March 1931,” he says.Churchill described “Hindus as a ‘beastly people with a beastly religion’ because they had the temerity to challenge his beloved British Empire. Churchill got along quite well with Indians who supported the Empire”, the book says.Akbar also argues that Churchill belonged to the “school of hard-boiled imperialists who scorned ‘Indian tricks’ and the religious baggage trundling in its wake”.“He was determined never to be outwitted by a toothless Mahatma without an appetite who had adopted the garb of a fakir. What Churchill did not appreciate was that Indians had always understood the difference between the artifice of a conjuror and the power of a man of God,” he writes.                                     #British                                     #Britishraj                                     #EastIndiaCompany                                     #Gandhi                                     #MJAkbar                                     #newbook                                     #RobertClive                                     #WinstonChurchill||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/when-clive-named-calcutta-one-of-most-wicked-places-361797
16-01-2022||Mumbai||Less than one-third of people get flight cancellation refund amid pandemic: Report||Less than one-third of the people who cancelled their flights owing to the emergence of the Omicron variant-led third pandemic wave were able to receive refunds, according to an online survey.For those who were forced to cancel their hotel bookings on account of the same reason, 34 per cent of people could get the refunds, online community platform Localcircles said in the survey.The survey received more than 20,000 responses from citizens residing in 332 districts of India.The rapid rise in the Omicron variant-led Covid cases in India have prompted many citizens—who had travel booked during January-March—to revisit their plans, and a subset of them have also approached airlines and hotels for cancellations.The first question in the survey on airlines asked citizens, “For the flight travel that you had booked for January-March 2022, how did the cancellation process work?” In response, 29 per cent said, “Travel agent and/or airline accepted cancellation and refunded full amount”, while 14 per cent said they received partial amount.At the same time, 29 per cent of respondents said “travel agent and/or airline accepted cancellation and refunded a very small amount”.About 14 per cent of people surveyed said, “travel agent and/or airline did not refund anything but rebooked the ticket for a later date,” and 14 per cent couldn’t say anything, as per the survey.On an aggregate basis, of those who cancelled flight tickets due to the third Covid wave, only 29 per cent were able to get a full refund from airlines/travel agents, it added.In comparison to the second wave, over twice as many citizens were able to get a flight ticket refund due to third-wave related cancellation. However, the majority still ended up losing money to airlines, the survey said.The survey found out that of those who cancelled hotel booking due to the third Covid wave, only 34 per cent were able to get a full refund from hotels/travel agents.On hotel bookings during January-March 2022, 34 per cent said “travel agent and/or hotel accepted cancellation and refunded full amount”, 13 per cent of respondents received a partial refund and 13 per cent got a very small amount.Besides, 27 per cent of people surveyed said “travel agent and/or hotel did not refund anything, and…lost the entire booking amount”.When compared to the second wave, over 2.5 times as many citizens were able to get a hotel booking refund due to third-wave related cancellation. However, the majority still ended up losing money to hotels, the survey said.“Citizens on the LocalCircles platform have been suggesting that the Government should come up with a special policy for travel booking refunds till the Covid pandemic is going on, especially for airlines and hotels.“Due to lack of uniformity in cancellation charges by different airlines and hotel operators, the majority don’t approve of the existing travel booking refund policies during the pandemic,” said Sachin Taparia, founder, LocalCircles.                                     #Covid                                     #flight                                     #refund||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/less-than-one-third-of-people-get-flight-cancellation-refund-amid-pandemic-report-361796

Three more died this morning,” he said.“All deaths have taken place in Chhoti Pahari and Pahari Talli localities of the town. The SHO of Sohsarai has been suspended for being lax in keeping an eye on the activities in an area under his jurisdiction,” added the SP.Bodies of the three persons who died Sunday morning have been sent for post mortem. All bereaved family members have said that the deceased consumed liquor on Friday night.Sale and consumption of liquor is completely banned in Bihar since April, 2016.The hooch tragedy comes barely two months after more than 40 people died after consuming spurious liquor in four north Bihar districts.Meanwhile, state BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal, whose party shares power in the state, launched a fresh attack on the chief minister’s party.“JD(U) leaders would do well to acknowledge that the hydra-headed monster that is illicit liquor trade cannot be slain until the nexus of high officials, police personnel and liquor mafia is broken,” said Jaiswal in a statement.The BJP leader, who represents Pashchim Champaran in Lok Sabha, has been sore ever since a JD(U) spokesman took potshots at him for the hooch deaths in his constituency in November last year.                                      #bihar                                     #death                                     #liquor||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-hooch-toll-climbs-to-11-361793

He announced his decision on social media on Saturday evening.Taking to Instagram, wife Anuskha Sharma penned a heartfelt note for Virat Kohli.The Bollywood actress wrote, "I remember the day in 2014 when you told me that you have been made the captain as MS had decided to retire from test cricket. I remember MS, you & I having a chat later that day & him joking about how quickly your beard will start turning grey. We all had a good laugh about it. Since that day, I’ve seen more than just your beard turning grey. I’ve seen growth. Immense growth. Around you & within you. And yes, I am very proud of your growth as the captain of the Indian National Cricket team & what achievements the team had under your leadership. But I’m more proud of the growth you achieved within you."Here's the note with a heartening picture of Virat Kohli:A post shared by AnushkaSharma1588 (@anushkasharma)Recalling the journey since 2014 and appreciating Virat for his commitment and good intentions, she added,"In 2014 we were so young & naive. Thinking that just good intentions, positive drive & motives can take you ahead in life. They definitely do but, not without challenges. A lot of these challenges that you faced were not always on the field. But then, this is life right? It tests you in places where you least expect it to but where you need it the most. And my love, I am so proud of you for not letting anything come in the way of your good intentions. You led by example & gave winning on field every ounce of your energy to the extent that after some losses I’ve sat next to you with tears in your eyes, while you wondered if there's still something more you could have done. This is who you are & this is what you expected from everyone. You've been unconventional & straightforward. Pretence is your foe & this is what makes you great in my eyes & the eyes of your admirers. Because underneath all this were your pure, unadulterated intentions always. And not everyone will be able to truly understand that. Like I’ve said, truly blessed are those who tried to get to know you beneath what meets the eye.

16-01-2022||New Delhi||Omicron 'deviant' from Covid pandemic progression script: Virologist||Omicron is a “deviant” from the Covid-19 pandemic progression script and so it must be postulated that two pandemics are going on side by side, one by the Delta and close relatives and the other by the latest variant of concern, said noted virologist Dr T Jacob John. Speaking to PTI on how the pandemic can now be expected to progress, he pointed out that Omicron is not “fathered, or mothered, by Wuhan-D614G, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Kappa or Mu and that much is for sure”.“So in my opinion, this is a variant of unknown proximal parentage but great, great grandparent was Wuhan-D614G... We shall see as the pandemic progresses,” John, a former director of the ICMR’s Centre of Advanced Research in Virology, said.D614G refers to an amino acid mutation in this protein that has become increasingly common in SARS-CoV-2 viruses from around the world.“Since Omicron is illegitimate or ‘deviant’ from Covid-19 pandemic progression script, we must think of two pandemics going on side by side—Delta and close relatives, and Omicron and its variants in the future.”“Diseases caused by them are also different. One is Pneumonia-hypoxia-multiorgan damage disease but the other an upper/middle respiratory disease that pushes pre-existing chronic disease or old age beyond the wall,” he said.Asked if the peak of the third wave has been reached since cases have started plateauing in some places, John said metro cities started first and will finish first.“All put together, this is a national epidemic,” he said.On whether the upcoming Covid-19 variants would be more infectious but less lethal, John said generally new pathogens get adapted to human hosts and in the process tend to become more infectious and less pathogenic, within limits.“Time frame is long, not one or two years... Remember, Delta came late but was both faster-spreading and more pathogenic,” he said.Omicron, the highly infectious variant of coronavirus, is driving the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic in India.The country registered 2,71,202 new coronavirus infections, taking the tally of Covid-19 cases to 3,71,22,164, including 7,743 cases of the Omicron variant, according to the Union Health Ministry data on Sunday.                                     #corona                                     #coronavirus                                     #Covid                                     #deviant                                     #mutations                                     #Omicron                                     #SARSCoV||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/omicron-a-deviant-from-covid-pandemic-progression-script-virologist-361771

Ali and Prakash too have sought an “independent, credible and impartial investigation” by an SIT into the incidents of alleged hate speeches at the Dharm Sansads.Referring to the videos with blatant calls for genocide against minority communities being circulating on social media, the petitioners — Major General SG Vombatkere, Colonel PK Nair and Major Priyadarshi Chowdhury — said if unchecked, such incidents would have a serious impact on the morale of the soldiers in the armed forces who come from diverse communities and religions.“From personal experience, it is felt that such hate speeches can even affect the battle-efficiency of our armed forces and in turn compromise national security,” the petitioners submitted.Such seditious and divisive speeches violate not only the criminal law of the land, but also strike at the core of Article 19 of the Constitution, they said, adding, “These speeches stain the secular fabric of the nation and also have serious potential to impact public order adversely.”Will impact morale of armed forcesIn their petition, Major General SG Vombatkere, Colonel PK Nair and Major Priyadarshi Chowdhury said if unchecked, such incidents would have a serious impact on the morale of the soldiers in the armed forces who come from diverse communities and religions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hate-speech-ex-army-officers-move-apex-court-for-sit-probe-361601

He humiliated the people of Bahujan Samaj. I tried hard, but the alliance could not happen,” Azad said, adding that efforts are being made to form a third front of several opposition parties.“However, if that does not materialise, Azad Samaj will go alone,” he added. Yadav has stitched an alliance with several small caste-based parties, building his campaign on social justice for backward classes and Dalits. Azad said leaders of backward classes, Dalits and others were supporting Yadav with a belief that he would do social justice. “However, I believe that Yadav does not understand the meaning of social justice,” Azad said.Yadav, however, rubbished Azad’s claims, saying he had offered him two seats. On CM Yogi Adityanath having food at a Dalit household, Azad said it was clear that he still considered “Dalits untouchable hence is trying to prove a point by going and eating there”.SP gets EC notice for violating Covid normsThe EC on Saturday issued a notice to the Samajwadi Party for organising a public gathering “in the name of virtual rally” at its Lucknow office on Friday in violation of Covid-19 norms.

The help extended by India is worth over $900 million and about $1.5 billion more is in the pipeline, said sources.Sri Lanka’s economic position can be gauged from the fact that shortly after China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit to Colombo, it is sending a shipment of sugar.During the virtual meeting, Jaishankar also raised the issue of Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan custody and urged for their early release as a humanitarian gesture while reaffirming that “India will be a steadfast and reliable partner of Sri Lanka”.“We positively noted the extension of the $400 million swap facility and the deferred ACU settlement of $515.2 million (by two months). Discussed the early realisation of 1 billion term loan facility for essential commodities and of 500 million LoC for fuel purchase,” the EAM said.The two ministers also reviewed the progress in extending the Indian credit facility of $1 billion for importing food, essential items and medicine and $500 million for importing fuel from India.During the meeting, Rajapaksa recalled India’s long-standing cooperation with Sri Lanka and deeply appreciated the gestures of support. He welcomed Indian investments in Sri Lanka in a number of important spheres, including ports, infrastructure, energy, renewable energy, power and manufacturing and assured that a conducive environment would be provided to encourage such investments.“The west terminal (at Colombo port) and the tank farm are two very important transactions (with India). As I see it, the two sides should move seamlessly into the strategic area,” Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner Asoka Milinda Moragoda said during a virtual address to students of Gandhinagar-based Rashtriya Raksha University.“Of course, given the nature of the power play in this region, Chinese presence can be looked at differently. In that context, I think our dialogue with India is what is important — to build trust and to understand each other. And, maybe, have some sort of red lines which both sides will not cross,” Moragoda said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-top-up-over-900-mn-aid-for-lanka-with-1-5-bn-bailout-package-361596

Rajnath Singh, Defence MinisterIn his address at the Army Day parade here, General Naravane said, “Our message is clear, the Army will stall any effort to unilaterally change the status quo at the boundary.” This third successive reference made it clear that the LAC cannot be altered by force. The LAC is the de facto boundary with China along the Himalayas and is not demarcated.In a message broadcast on Friday night, the General said, “We stand firm to counter any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo along borders.” On January 12, he had said, “No status quo (at the LAC) can be changed with force.” India has in the past officially said that China made a unilateral attempt in April/May 2020 to alter the LAC. Both countries have their own perception where the LAC runs hence the dispute. A military stand-off has ensued in the past 20 months and the Army Chief’s words come at time when the 14th round of talks between military commanders failed to resolve all points of friction along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.This morning at the parade, the Army Chief said the two armies have disengaged at several places and termed it as “a positive step”. He added, “We continue to work to resolve the existing issue on basis of mutual security.”Asserting that the morale of our troops was high, he said, “Patience is the outcome of our self-confidence, none should try and test it.”New combat uniformThe Army on Saturday unveiled a new combat uniform that is comfortable, climate-friendly and features a digital disruptive pattern.

Both are contesting the February 14 elections in an alliance. Twentytwo of the 32 farm unions from Punjab that comprised the SKM regrouped under Rajewal to float the political outfit. Rajewal and Charuni were core committee members of the SKM.The decision to expel their outfits was taken today during a general house meeting organised by the SKM at the ‘Kisan Andolan’ office at Singhu border. Farmer leaders Rakesh Tikait, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Jagjeet Singh Dallewal, Yogendra Yadav and Yudhvir Singh were among those present.Opposing 2 partiesThe Samyukt Kisan Morcha isn’t opposing any farm organisation, but only the two political parties (floated by Rajewal and Charuni). Joginder Singh Ugrahan, BKU-Ekta presidentUgrahan, BKU-Ekta president, said any farm outfit or leader taking the poll plunge or getting indirectly involved in electoral politics couldn’t be part of the SKM. “The SKM isn’t opposing any farm organisation, but only the two political parties (floated by Rajewal and Charuni),” he maintained. If needed, said Ugrahan, the decision may be reviewed after three months.The SKM said their organisation was apolitical and no politician was allowed on any stage during the over 12 months of their agitation. Yudhvir said Tikait would visit Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh for three days from January 21 to press for the sacking of Union Minister Ajay Mishra whose son Ashish is accused of mowing down protesting farmers last year. “Tikait will meet victims, jailed farmers and officials. If there is no progress, a siege may be laid in Lakhimpur by farmer organisations. A ‘pucca morcha’ may be started there,” he said.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha leadership also warned of launching ‘Mission UP’ (against the BJP) from February 1 if the Union Government failed to fulfil its promises, including formation of a committee on MSP and cancellation of police cases against protesters. “We will observe January 31 as ‘Vishwasghat Diwas’ (betrayal day) and hold nationwide protests at block and district headquarters’ level,” the SKM said.
