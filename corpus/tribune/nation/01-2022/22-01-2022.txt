Canada’s High Commissioner-designate to India Cameron MacKay called for bringing human smugglers to justice stating that “Canadians are shocked by the tragedy”.US authorities have detained seven people without proper documentation, as well as one US citizen, for allegedly being involved in human smuggling activity.On the US side, India’s Consulate in Chicago has sent a team to Minneapolis, which has sought consular access to the seven detained persons of apparent Indian descent. Indian missions in the US are also in touch with US Justice Department and the Border Police, said the sources.Giving a sequence of events, sources said on January 19, US authorities in Minnesota State, near the border with Canada, came across a group of people, apparently without proper documentation. Based on information about some persons left behind, Canadian authorities launched a search and found four bodies on their side of the border.These four (a man, a woman, a teenage boy, an infant) appeared to have died due to the cold.The people without proper documentation on the US side, as well as the dead people on the Canadian side, appear to be Indian nationals, said the sources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/diaspora/attempt-to-identify-family-that-froze-to-death-on-us-canada-border-363544

The stretch also sports 422 red granite benches.Along the Rajpath, the new red granite walkways spreading 1,10,457 sqm have been created, replacing bajri sand that lined the ground earlier.As many as 987 concrete bollards have been installed on the Rajpath. A total of 1,490 modern-look manholes have replaced the earlier ones.On January 11, Puri had said the recent record rainfall had delayed the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project by “a day or two, but not more”.Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Limited is executing the redevelopment work of the Central Vista Avenue.The redevelopment project of the Central Vista—the nation’s power corridor—envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the three-km Rajpath, a new prime minister’s residence and prime minister’s office, and a new vice president’s enclave.                                      #CentralVista                                     #HardeepPuri                                     #Rajpath                                     #Republicday||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/redeveloped-central-vista-will-have-red-granite-walkways-stepped-gardens-363543

22-01-2022||Ranchi||CBI seems to be protecting accused in judge murder case: Jharkhand HC||Jharkhand High Court has slammed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for its “laxity” in probing the murder of Dhanbad judge Uttam Anand, and observed that it seems that the agency was trying to quit the investigation and even protect the accused.The division bench of Chief Justice Ravi Ranjan and Justice S N Prasad, while reading the report of the narco-analysis test of the two accused, on Friday said when the auto-driver and his accomplice knew that Anand was a judge before hitting him, how could the CBI come up with the theory of murder for robbing a mobile phone?Rejecting the CBI’s theory, the bench said that the agency has failed to get down to the bottom of the matter.“The investigation into the case raises a question on the credibility of the CBI. It seems that the agency is now tired of the case and wants to quit the investigation, which is why it is making up stories so that the accused are not charged with murder. The probe is going in such a direction that it appears that the CBI is trying to protect the accused,” the bench noted.The narco-analysis test report was read out in the court. In the report, the autorickshaw driver’s assistant Rahul said, “Lakhan was driving the autorickshaw fast. I was sitting on the left side. The judge was jogging slowly. He had a handkerchief in his left hand. Lakhan hit the judge intentionally and he collapsed on the ground.”The report found that someone had assigned them the task to kill the judge.The bench said that when the report of the narco-analysis test conducted by the CBI says that both the accused knew the judge beforehand and they did not find his mobile phone, how can the investigating agency say that he was murdered for a mobile phone?With the CBI planning to conduct another narco-analysis test, the bench wondered if there is a need for another such test after four months and if the report contradicted the previous one, which one is to be believed?The CBI earlier presented a map showing the judge’s morning walk route, and stated that the entire area was under CCTV surveillance, and all the mobile phones active in the area at that time were examined but no communication was found between the accused and anyone else.It said that the accused had not conducted a recce before hitting the judge, and neither had the auto-rickshaw stopped in between nor had anyone contacted them.But the court said that the way the judge was killed, it seems that the accused had conducted a recce earlier.The court said that even after the passage of so many months since the incident on July 28 last year, the CBI’s inability to close the case with a logical conclusion raises a question on the agency’s credibility.It said that the incident was gradually moving towards a hit-and-run case.“Jharkhand has been affected by militancy but never before has a judge come under threat. The incident has caught the attention of the entire nation. The court wants that the main conspirator be brought to book and sentenced so that such incidents don’t recur,” it said.Additional Solicitor General S V Raju, virtually appearing for CBI from Delhi, said that National Investigation Agency (NIA) besides CBI is also a very competent agency and the case can be handed over to it, to which the bench wondered whether the CBI was trying to quit the investigation.                                      #CBI                                     #DhanbadJudge                                     #JharkhandHighCourt                                     #Judgemurder||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-seems-to-be-protecting-accused-in-judge-murder-case-jharkhand-hc-363539

22-01-2022||IANS||Kerala nun rape case: Prosecution to appeal acquittal of Bishop Franco Mulakkal||Thiruvananthapuram, January 22Kerala police has decided to appeal against the acquittal of Catholic Bishop Franco Mulakkal in the nun rape case before a higher court.The special prosecutor in the case Jithesh Babu submitted the legal advice to this effect to the Kottayam SP, who will go forward in the appeal, as the time period for it is 90 days, from the date of the verdict which came from the Kottayam Additional district court judge G. Gopakumar on January 14, whose verdict enabled Franco to walk out free.Incidentally, soon after the verdict came, the former Kottayam SP Harisankar, who oversaw the probe, said he was supremely confident that the verdict would be against the accused."This was the least expected as the witnesses did a very clean job. An appeal should be filed," said Harisankar, then.The trial in the case extended over 105 days with 39 witnesses being examined and 122 documents produced before the court. While serving as Bishop of the Jalandhar Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church, he was accused of raping a nun, who belonged to the Missionaries of Jesus congregation.During his visits between 2014 and 2016 to Kerala, he was accused of raping the 43-year old nun on 13 occasions. Later, he was removed from the charge of the Jalandhar diocese.A complaint was filed against him in June 2018 in Kerala and Mulakkal was arrested on September 21, 2018 on rape charges.He secured bail on October 16, 2018.The charge sheet names 83 witnesses, including the Cardinal of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, Mar George Alencherry, three bishops, 11 priests and 22 nuns.Of the 83 witnesses, 39 were called and they were heard.Franco had approached the Kerala High Court and also the Supreme Court to quash the FIR against him, but both the courts refused to do so and the trial began.--IANS                                     #BishopFrancoMulakkal                                     #KeralaNunRape||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-nun-rape-case-prosecution-to-appeal-acquittal-of-mulakkal-363532
22-01-2022||Satya Prakash||PIL urges SC to declare poll-eve freebies unconstitutional||New Delhi, January 22As political parties attempt to woo the electorate by populist promises in the ensuing assembly polls in five states, including Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, a PIL in the Supreme Court on Saturday demanded that irrational freebies using public funds be declared unconstitutional.In his PIL filed through advocate AK Dubey, petitioner Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay – a Delhi BJP leader and advocate – contended that “promise of irrational freebies from public funds before elections unduly influences voters, disturbs level-playing field, shakes the roots of a free and fair election, and vitiates purity of election process”.Holding that freebies promised in poll manifestos vitiated the electoral process, the top court had on July 5, 2013 asked the Election Commission to frame guidelines to check it in consultation of political parties.Such promises by the political parties violated Articles 14, 162, 266(3) and 282 of the Constitution and amounted to bribery and undue influence under Section 171B and Section 171C of the IPC , he submitted.“The injury to the citizens is extremely large because Punjab needs Rs 12,000 crore per month to fulfil the political promises if AAP comes to power, Rs 25,000 crore per month if SAD comes to power and Rs 30,000 crore (per month) if Congress comes in power, though GST collection is Rs 1400 crore only,” Upadhyay submitted.“In fact, after debt repayment, the Punjab government is not able to pay even salaries-pensions, then how will it provide freebies? The bitter truth is that Punjab’s debt is increasing every subsequent year. The state’s outstanding debt has increased to Rs 77,000 crore, with Rs 30,000 crore accumulating in the present financial year itself,” the PIL pointed out.“Political parties are prioritising their self-interest over national interest and the public fund, which should have been properly utilized to secure fundamental rights of citizens, is being used to lure voters,” Upadhyay said, urging the top court to direct the Election Commission to seize election symbols and deregister political parties that promised to distribute irrational freebies to voters from public funds.“Unless some mechanism is put in place, political parties would try to buy out the voters by hook or crook as their aim is only to ascend to power,” he submitted.                                     #assemblyelections                                     #PollFreebies                                     #SupremeCourt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-urges-sc-to-declare-poll-eve-freebies-unconstitutional-363529

This is Kairana from where people used to flee earlier, and today when I went on around, the people told me that 'Modijee kee kripa ho gayee'. "Yogiji has improved the law and order. Those who forced the exodus have had to flee. This is the kind of confidence we are seeing in the people of UP. I think that in the coming days, Uttar Pradesh will become the most developed state of India," Shah told reporters here.The Union Home Minister met the "victim" families who have returned to Kairana after the BJP came to power.  "They said that they do not have any fear now, and they are peacefully doing their business activities," Shah said.  Security personnel had a difficult time as crowds jostled to see the BJP leader."I would like to tell the people of UP that if you want to retain the law and order situation in UP, end appeasement and the culture of working for one caste, and develop UP under the leadership of Modijee, then the government of Yogi Adityanath should be formed once again," Shah later told reporters.  He appealed to the people of western UP to come out and vote on February 10."'If owing to COVID guidelines, our workers are not able to reach you, then you should cast your vote early in the morning keeping in mind the five years of hard work of the BJP and the achievements of seven-and-half years of Modiji."  He exuded confidence that the BJP will win 300 seats in the 403-member UP Legislative Assembly. The Union Home Minister noted that he is coming to Kairana after January 2014. ''Today after coming to Kairana, I am feeling at peace due to the atmosphere here. "After 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the reins of development of UP in his hand. After becoming the chief minister of UP in 2017, Yogi Adityanath accelerated the pace of development. In the entire state, a new wave of development and enthusiasm can be seen," Shah said.  He listed various achievements of the government including the building of roads, airports and medical colleges and provision of cooking gas for the poor, toilets, free vaccines during COVID and free ration. "All these schemes were sent by Modiji, and Yogiji implemented at the ground level," he said.  The residents of the area spoke about security being the most important issue for them and some showered flower petals on the BJP leader and chanted 'Modi-Modi'.Security personnel, however, had a difficult time as crowds jostled to approach the BJP leader.  The BJP has fielded Mriganka Singh, eldest daughter of late Hukum Singh who had won the seat several times, from Kairana against the RLD-Samajwadi Party candidate Iqra Hasan.  Iqra Hasan was fielded after political adversaries attacked the SP for giving a ticket to tainted sitting party MLA Nahid Hassan who was arrested under Gangster Act on January 15 after filing his nomination. Kairana is a city and municipal board in Shamli district in western UP.Shah has been again given the task of overseeing the BJP campaign for assembly elections as he is known to have a good understanding of caste dynamics in the state and effective coordination with workers across constituencies.He was the chief architect of the BJP's stupendous wins in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha elections and 2017 assembly polls in the bellwether state. Elections to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly will be held in seven phases starting from February 10.PTI                                     #UPPolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-hah-meets-exodus-affected-families-in-kairana-as-he-begins-door-to-door-campaign-in-western-up-363525

Jaleel, local MP and state All India Majalis-E-Ittehadul Muslimeen president, said in a letter to district guardian minister Subhash Desai that Maharana Pratap's name is immortal in history due to his valor.But nothing would be gained by erecting his statue by spending Rs 90 lakh, and the real tribute would be to set up a `sainik school' in his name where the youth from rural areas can avail of military training, he said. Local Shiv Sena leader and Member of Legislative Council Ambadas Danve, however, criticized Jaleel for his stand.Maharana Pratap is a "pride of Hindutva", he tweeted, adding that the AIMIM MP "may not get inspiration for good work from statues, but we get that." Danve also said that Jaleel should get a sainik school built through a Central government scheme and also ensure that the Kendriya Vidyalaya in the district is expanded.                                      #AIMIM                                     #MaharanaPratap||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aimim-mp-opposes-maharana-prataps-statue-says-military-school-would-be-better-tribute-363520
22-01-2022||IANS||Oxygen requirement in 3rd Covid wave remains nominal: Study||New Delhi, January 22The oxygen requirement during the current Covid-19 wave stands at a nominal 23.4 per cent in comparison to the demands in the first and the second wave as high as 63 per cent and 74 per cent, respectively, said a study conducted by Max Healthcare on all admitted patients across the hospitals.During a phase when Delhi recorded 28,000 positive cases per day in the second wave last year, hospitals across the city were full and no ICU beds were available.In comparison to that, in the third wave, when the national capital recorded its highest around 28,000 positive cases in a single day, the hospital Covid occupancy is at less, as per the study.The overall mortality in the first wave was at 7.2 per cent which increased to 10.5 per cent during the second wave. However, only 6 per cent mortality in Covid-19 patients during the ongoing wave has been recorded at hospitals.Talking to IANS, Sandeep Buddhiraja, Group Medical Director, Max Healthcare, who conducted the study, said: "Two important points have been observed from the study. One is that total admissions during this wave have been very less. The second point is that out of total admitted patients in hospitals during the second wave, around 70 to 80 per cent needed the oxygen support. However, in this wave only 20 to 30 per cent of total admission have needed the oxygen support which indicates that the infection is not much severe this time." Dr Buddhiraja added that despite the fact that less people needed hospital admission this time, at least 40 per cent needed hospital care because of multiple medical problems and comorbidities.Among the paediatric admissions across hospitals, only 41 children below 18 years have been admitted. However, no deaths have been reported in this age-group.On being asked about the children hospitalisation trends in this wave, Buddhiraja said no such rising trends of kids hospital admission have been observed so far.

22-01-2022||New Delhi||Delhi HC directs UIDAI to give info of people issued fake Aadhaar cards||The Delhi High Court has directed the UIDAI to provide information relating to over 400 people who were allegedly issued fake Aadhaar cards for enrollment for civil defence training in the national capital.Justice Chandra Dhari Singh allowed the petition filed by the Delhi government seeking direction to the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to disclose information on the Aadhaar card holders sought by an investigation agency for probe of a case.The case was lodged by the Anti-Corruption Branch for the alleged offences of criminal conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act.“This court is inclined to allow the instant petition. The respondent (UIDAI) is hereby directed to provide all relevant information, qua the persons named in annexure... of the petition, as required for the purposes of investigation as per the provisions of the Aadhaar Act.“The investigation agency is also directed to investigate the matter, upon receiving the requested information, with due regard to the provisions of the statute,” the court said.According to the petition, a complaint of Vijender Gupta was received in the Delhi government’s Anti Corruption Branch stating that the manner of recruitment of marshals for DTC buses was illegal.It was further alleged that the recruitment process was manipulated and the district magistrate had issued fake certificates, certifying as Delhi residents for making Aadhaar cards, to over 400 people from his home state Rajasthan and had compelled them to pay Rs 2 lakh per head.It was alleged that a large number of Aadhaar cards with bogus Delhi addresses were made for people from Rajasthan at the Aadhaar centre functioning in the office of the district magistrate on holidays.On the basis of the complaint, an FIR was lodged in January 2020.The prosecutor submitted before the court that the then district magistrate had committed criminal misconduct by abusing official position as public servant with an ulterior motive to give benefit to ineligible people, and in total, around 450 candidates with fake Aadhaar cards who had enrolled for training in civil defence.She said the information sought by the investigation agency was crucial for establishing the forgery committed and disclosure of such an information by the authority in no way amounts to invasion of right to privacy of the card holders.The counsel for UIDAI submitted that the authority has no objection in sharing the information being sought, to the extent and in a manner as permissible under the provisions of the Aadhar Act, on being directed by this court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-hc-directs-uidai-to-give-info-of-people-issued-fake-aadhaar-cards-363518

We know there are great risks in doing so,” he said.The prime minister said that Canada is working very closely with the United States to stop smuggling.According to Canadian officials, the incident was unusual as illegal migrants generally try to cross into Canada from America, rather than the other way round. Border crossings into Canada on foot increased in 2016 following the election of Donald Trump as the president of the United States.On Thursday, the Manitoba Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said that the bodies of four people—two adults, a teen and an infant—were found on the Canadian side of the US/Canada border near the Emerson locality in south central Manitoba on Wednesday.The family, believed to be Gujaratis, died from the exposure to extreme cold weather.Confirming the nationality of the deceased, India's High Commissioner to Canada Ajay Bisaria described the incident as a grave tragedy."This is a grave tragedy. An Indian consular team is travelling today from @IndiainToronto to Manitoba to coordinate and help. We will work with Canadian authorities to investigate these disturbing events," Bisaria tweeted.According to the criminal complaint filed in a court in the US state of Minnesota, all the foreign nationals found on the US side, part of the larger group, spoke in Gujarati.Manitoba RCMP was notified by US Customs and Border Protection on Wednesday morning that a group of people had crossed into the US near Emerson, and that one of the adults was carrying items intended for a baby, but there was no infant with the group.An immediate search began on both sides of the border, and by that afternoon, the bodies of an adult man, an adult woman, and an infant were found. The body of a boy believed to be in his mid-teens was found shortly afterwards.The US Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota said in a press release that 47-year-old Steve Shand of Florida had been arrested.A criminal complaint has been filed on Thursday in the US District Court for the District of Minnesota against Shand, who has been charged with human smuggling.Shand, a "suspected smuggler of undocumented foreign nationals”, was arrested near the US/Canadian border on January 19 for transporting two Indian nationals, who were illegally present in the US. The two Indian nationals have been identified as ‘SP' and ‘YP' in the complaint.The complaint said that five Indian nationals “illegally present in the United States were also identified and arrested” around the time of Shand's arrest.Inside the vehicle, US officers found cases of plastic cups, bottled water, bottled juice and snacks in the van. As the officers were taking the trio back to the border patrol station in North Dakota, they came across another group of five Indian nationals walking.They said they had walked across the border and had expected to be picked up by someone. The group said they estimated they had been walking for more than 11 hours.One person in the group had a backpack he told officials he was carrying for a family of four they had become separated from that contained children's items such as clothes, a diaper and a toy.The bodies found on the Canadian side of the border have been tentatively identified as that family of four, the release from the US Attorney's Office said.Soon after the discovery of the four bodies on the Canadian side of the border, RCMP Assistant Commissioner Jane MacLatchy called it "an absolute and heartbreaking tragedy"."At this very early stage of the investigation, it appears that they all died due to exposure to the cold weather," MacLatchy said, adding that the RCMP believe the four people are connected to the group that was apprehended on the US side of the border.She said all four were located within 9-12 metre of the border.MacLatchy said that the group was "on their own in the middle of a blizzard" and "faced not only the cold weather but endless fields, large snowdrifts and complete darkness".Canadian police said the conditions where the four bodies were extreme and the temperature was 35 below zero degrees with a wind chill.MacLatchy said work is under way to identify the victims, but at this stage, it appears they all died from exposure to the cold.The RCMP said it is working with US Customs and Border Protection and the US Department of Homeland Security.In a statement, the Canada Border Services Agency said it is also working with law enforcement partners, as well as its American counterparts, on the investigation.The office of the Minister of Public Safety said in a statement: “We are shocked and saddened by the tragic deaths of four people attempting to cross the Canada-US border, near Emerson, Manitoba. We extend our most heartfelt condolences to their loved ones, and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.”                                     #JustinTrudeau||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/diaspora/indians-death-in-brutal-cold-canadian-pm-trudeau-says-working-very-closely-with-us-to-stop-smuggling-363485

22-01-2022||New Delhi||Amar Jawan Jyoti at India Gate merged with eternal flame at National War Memorial||The Amar Jawan Jyoti at the India Gate was merged with the eternal flame at the National War Memorial (NWM) here on Friday.The Amar Jawan Jyoti will be put out and people can now pay their respects at the eternal flame at the NWM, military officials said.After India defeated Pakistan in the 1971 war, the Amar Jawan Jyoti was constructed as a memorial for Indian soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice. It was inaugurated by the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, on January 26, 1972.In a short ceremony on Friday afternoon, a part of the Amar Jawan Jyoti flame was taken and merged with the flame at the NWM 400 metres away.Chief of Integrated Defence Staff Air Marshal B R Krishna presided over the ceremony, the military officials said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on February 25, 2019, inaugurated the NWM, where names of 25,942 soldiers have been inscribed in golden letters on granite tablets.Ex-servicemen expressed mixed reactions on the Centre's decision to merge the flames.Former Army Chief General Ved Malik supported the government's decision, stating that it is "a natural thing" to merge flames now as the NWM has been established and all ceremonials related to remembrance and honouring soldiers killed in action are being held there.Former Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur, however, tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Twitter and requested him to rescind the decision."Sir, the eternal flame at India Gate is part of India's psyche. You, I and our generation grew up saluting our brave jawans there," he stated.While the NWM is great, the memories of the Amar Jawan Jyoti are indelible, Bahadur noted.The Congress on Friday morning accused the BJP government of "removing history" by extinguishing the Amar Jawan Jyoti at the India Gate here and merging it with the eternal flame at the NWM.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi hit out, saying some people cannot understand patriotism and sacrifice, and added that the Congress will light the Amar Jawan Jyoti once again."It is a matter of great sadness that the immortal flame for our brave soldiers will be extinguished today. Some people cannot understand patriotism and sacrifice - never mind...We will once again light the 'Amar Jawan Jyoti' for our soldiers," Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.Government sources maintained there is a lot of misinformation on the matter, and said the flame of the Amar Jawan Jyoti is not being extinguished but is being merged with the flame at the National War Memorial.BJP leader Sambit Patra also echoed the government view in a tweet.The government sources said it was an odd thing to see that the flame at Amar Jawan Jyoti paid homage to the martyrs of the 1971 and other wars but none of their names are present there at the India Gate.The names inscribed on the India Gate are of only some martyrs who fought for the British in the World War-I and the Anglo Afghan War and thus is a symbol of the country's colonial past, the government sources said.They said the names of all Indian martyrs from all the wars are housed at the National War Memorial. Hence, it is a true homage to have the flame paying tribute to martyrs there, they added.

Bayern’s deployment in the region is in line with Germany’s Indo-Pacific policy guidelines that focus on maritime security and cooperation, a pre-requisite for global stability, he observed.Shringla identified counter-terrorism as another key area of cooperation and referred to the recent incident in Texas which showed that the international network of terror, with its epicentre in India’s neighbourhood, was very much active and had long-lasting implications. “Just two days ago, India reiterated its position when it conveyed that any attack on innocent civilians and civilian infrastructure was completely unacceptable. It will be in blatant violation of international law and against all civilised norms,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-welcomes-germanys-foray-into-indo-pacific-region-363295

The Constitution will consume the 100 crore Hindus of this country. Those who believe in this Constitution will be killed. Those who believe in this system, in these politicians, in the Supreme Court, and in the Army will all die the death of a dog.”In a letter addressed to activist Shachi Nelli, who had sought his consent to initiate contempt proceedings against Narsinghanand, Venugopal said the statement in question was a “direct attempt to lower the authority of the Supreme Court in the minds of the general public. This will certainly amount to contempt of the Supreme Court”.Arrested by the Haridwar Police on January 15 in a hate speech case, the Juna Akhara Mahamandleshwar was denied bail by a Haridwar court on Thursday.Nelli had written to Venugopal that the comments were a vile and clear attempt at interfering in the course of justice by means of abusive rhetoric and baseless attacks on the integrity of the Constitution and courts and undermined the majesty and the authority of the Supreme Court.SC upholds Gujarat’s purchase tax demandThe SC on Friday upheld the Gujarat Government’s Rs480.99 crore purchase tax demand and penalty on ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India Limited, previously known as Essar Steel Ltd, for wrongly availing of tax exemption.Self-immolation bid outside apex courtA man on Friday attempted self-immolation outside the SC.

Despite higher recruitment, the number of officers on Central deputation has dropped from 117 to 114 during the same period. This has necessitated tweaking of the rules,” said a source.The sources said at least seven states had written to the Centre opposing the proposed changes. Apart from Bengal, Odisha, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh these include BJP and NDA-ruled Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Meghalaya.As per a plan, amendments are proposed to Rule 6 of the IAS (Cadre) Rules-1954. One of the major changes proposed is that if the state government delays posting a state cadre officer to the Centre and does not implement the Centre’s decision within a specified time, “the officer shall stand relieved from the cadre from the date as may be specified by the Union Government”.At present, officers have to get a no-objection certificate from the state government for the Central deputation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/despite-states-objections-centre-mulls-changes-in-ias-ips-rules-363289

You, I and our generation grew up saluting our brave jawans there,” he wrote.But Lieutenant General Satish Dua (retd) expressed “great satisfaction” over the move. “I had been of this view all along that India Gate is a memorial to the fallen heroes of World War-I… National War Memorial pays homage to the soldiers killed in action after the country’s Independence,” he observed.British-built India Gate has the names of soldiers who fought for the British during World War I (1914-18) and the Anglo-Afghan wars between 1837 and 1919.‘National gratitude’ Netaji’s statue at India gateA statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose will come up at India Gate as a symbol of ‘national gratitude’, PM announced on Twitter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amar-jawan-jyoti-merged-with-war-memorial-flame-363286

22-01-2022||New Delhi||Extinguishing Amar Jawan Jyoti amounts to extinguishing history: Congress||The Congress on Friday accused the BJP government of "removing history" by extinguishing the Amar Jawan Jyoti at the India Gate here and merging it with the immortal flame at the National War Memorial.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi hit out, saying some people cannot understand patriotism and sacrifice, and added that the Congress would light the Amar Jawan Jyoti once again."It is a matter of great sadness that the immortal flame for our brave soldiers will be extinguished today. Some people cannot understand patriotism and sacrifice - never mind...We will once again light the 'Amar Jawan Jyoti' for our soldiers," Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.Government sources maintained that there is a lot of misinformation on the matter, saying the flame of the Amar Jawan Jyoti is not being extinguished, but is being merged with the flame at the National War Memorial.BJP leader Sambit Patra also echoed the government view in a tweet.Congress leader Manish Tewari alleged that extinguishing the flame amounted to removing history."Extinguishing Amar Jawan Jyoti tantamounts to extinguishing history. For it commentates sacrifice of those 3,483 brave soldiers who cleaved Pakistan into two parts and redrew map of South Asia post partition," he said on Twitter. Tewari said it is ironical that in the 50th year of liberation of Bangladesh the government seems to be working overtime to erase India's finest hour in post independent history."Amar Jawan Jyoti is imbued in the national consciousness. A billion people have grown up venerating it. Why can't India have two eternal flames? Amar Jawan Jyoti and National War Memorial."Redeveloping the Central Vista was hubris enough but extinguishing the eternal flame at India Gate is nothing short of a crime. I am surprised that the nation is silent as a national icon would be snuffed out in the project to re-write history," the former union minister said.Government sources said it was an odd thing to see that the flame at Amar Jawan Jyoti paid homage to the martyrs of the 1971 and other wars but none of their names are present there.The names inscribed on the India Gate are of only some martyrs who fought for the British in the World War 1 and the Anglo Afghan War and thus is a symbol of our colonial past, the government sources said.They said the names of all Indian martyrs from all the wars, including 1971 and wars before and after it are housed at the National War Memorial.Hence it is a true homage to have the flame paying tribute to martyrs there, they added.Patra said, "It is ironic that people who did not make a National War Memorial for seven decades are now making a hue and cry when a permanent and fitting tribute is being made to our martyrs".                                     #AmarJawanJyoti||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/extinguishing-amar-jawan-jyoti-amounts-to-extinguishing-history-congress-363201
