There were six foreigners in the third category of Padma Sri awards, including a former Ambassador of Poland to India.While Satya Narayana Nadella, Sundararajan Pichai and Madhur Jaffery are the well-known Americans of Indian origin who were awarded the second highest Padma Bhushan, a fourth Indian Sanjaya Rajaram, though not as well known and who passed away last year, made more concrete contribution to the country’s farm sector.Sanjaya Rajaram was a Mexican scientist who won the 2014 World Food Prize for developing 480 wheat varieties that have been released in 51 countries. This innovation led to an increase in global wheat production by over 20 crore tons. The Government had recognised his contribution earlier as well by awarding him the Padma Shri.Among the six awardees for Padma Sri, three are Sanskrit scholars from Poland, Ireland and Thailand. One of the winners, Sanskrit scholar from Ireland Rutger Kortenhorst was mentioned by PM Modi in his ‘Mann ki baat’ programme last year.

25-01-2022||New Delhi||13 SC judges, 400 court staff infected with Covid-19 in third wave: CJI||Thirteen judges of the Supreme Court and 400 court staff were infected with Covid19 during the third wave of the pandemic, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said on Tuesday.The revelation came from the CJI after an advocate complained that his case was not urgently listed by the Registry for hearing."If you don't know the problem, what can we do? Four hundred people in the Registry got Covid and 13 judges were tested positive with the virus. Despite our bodies not cooperating we are sitting and doing cases…You should understand that,” CJI Ramana told the lawyer.Against a sanctioned strength of 34 judges, the Supreme Court has a working strength of 32 judges, including the Chief Justice of India. It has nearly 3,000 court staff.In view of the rising number of Covid-19 cases, the top court had reverted to the virtual system of hearings from January 3 in view of the third wave of Covid19.                                     #CJI                                     #infected                                     #judges                                     #SC                                     #SupremeCourt                                     #thirdwave||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/13-sc-judges-400-court-staff-infected-with-covid-19-in-third-wave-cji-364397

25-01-2022||New Delhi||Job aspirants involved in vandalism while protesting will be barred from getting recruited: Railways||Railway job aspirants found involved in vandalism and unlawful activities while protesting will be barred from ever getting recruited in the railways, the national transporter said on Tuesday, a day after protesters squatted on tracks in several places in Bihar.In a general notice, the railways said, "Such misguided activities are the highest level of indiscipline rendering such aspirants unsuitable for railway/government job. Videos of such activities will be examined...and candidates/aspirants found indulged in unlawful activities will be liable for police action as well as lifetime debarment from obtaining railway job." The notice came a day after railway job aspirants squatted on tracks at different places in Bihar, including the state capital Patna, to protest alleged erroneous results of Railway Recruitment Board's Non-Technical Popular Categories (RRB NTPC) exam.The protests, which continued till late in the evening on Monday, resulted in the cancellation of at least five long-distance trains originating from Patna. Routes of some other trains were diverted as the youth blocked tracks at Rajendra Nagar Terminal.The railways also cautioned the aspirants that they should not come under the influence of elements which are trying to misguide them for their own “selfish ends”.Officials said the railways has also got in touch with coaching centres to urge them to spread awareness among candidates.The controversy over the exam arose as many candidates claimed the screening process is designed to favour those with higher qualification, even in jobs that require lesser qualification.For the NTPC exam, around 1.25 crore candidates had appeared and the results were declared earlier this month.The railways had earlier said that it was looking to fill 35,281 posts. Of these, 24,281 posts in 13 categories were open to graduates and 11,000 posts in six categories were for undergraduates. These thirteen categories were segregated into five groups based on the Seventh Central Pay Commission pay-scale levels (Levels 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).These posts included that of train assistant, guard, junior clerk, time keeper and station master across its various zones.While to get a Level 2 job, where the starting pay is about Rs 19,000 one requires to be a Class 12 pass, for a level 6 post like station master, who gets a starting pay of about Rs 35,000 being a graduate is mandatory.Aspirants have alleged that during the Computer Based Test -1 which were held last year, candidates with higher qualification have sat for exams meant for Level 2 jobs."If these candidates sit for such jobs, how will we even imagine getting these jobs which are meant for us?” an aspirant wrote on social media.The problem, officials said, is that the railways cannot stop an aspirant with higher qualification from sitting for an exam with lower qualification requirement.In a clarification, the railways has said that no candidate can be recruited for multiple posts thereby ensuring that every deserving candidate gets selected.It said short-listing of candidates has been done separately for each level based on educational qualifications and options exercised by the candidates.For the second stage computer-based test (CBT) of each level, the number of candidates called was 20 times the community-wise vacancies notified against each RRB, it said."In case multiple candidates have obtained same marks at the cut-off, all have been called," it said.Based on merit obtained in second stage CBT, the candidates will be short-listed for third stage exam in which eight times the number of vacancies will be called."The final result will contain a unique list of 35,281 notified vacancies and no candidate will be appointed against more than one post. A candidate who has been short-listed for high level post cannot be debarred for appearing in second stage CBT of lower level post," it said.Earlier, the short-listing was done 10 times the vacancy, however, this time it is 20 times the vacancy for second stage, officials said.According to the RRB NTPC exam dates, the CBT 2 exam for which seven lakh candidates have been short-listed is scheduled to be conducted on February 14 and 18.                                      #RailwayMinistry                                     #Railways||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/job-aspirants-involved-in-vandalism-while-protesting-will-be-barred-from-getting-recruited-railways-364393
25-01-2022||Saurabh MalikChandigarh||Beant Singh assassination: Balwant Singh Rajoana seeks parole to attend father’s last rites||Facing the gallows after being convicted in Punjab’s former Chief Minister Beant Singh’s assassination case, former Punjab police constable Balwant Singh Rajoana on Tuesday moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court seeking parole for attending his father’s last rites.In his petition filed through counsel Vivek K Thakur, Rajoana submitted that he was in custody for the last 26 years and was awarded the death penalty on July 27, 2007. Thakur submitted on the petitioner’s behalf that he filed an application before the jail authorities seeking permission to attend the last rites of his father.It was stated that his father was the only person taking care of him in the jail and continuously meeting him for the last 26 years. As such, he may be permitted to attend the last rites. His request was, however, rejected on the ground that he could not be released on parole since he was undergoing a death sentence.Thakur submitted that the Supreme Court in similar circumstances allowed a parole petition filed by a convict undergoing a death sentence to attend his mother’s last rites after being escorted by the police. The petition is scheduled to come up for hearing on January 27.The former Chief Minister was assassinated in a blast outside the Punjab Civil Secretariat on August 31, 1995. Human bomb Dilawar Singh too was killed in the explosion, along with 16 others.                                     #BalwantSinghRajoana                                     #BeantSinghassassination                                     #parole                                     #PunjabHC                                     #Rajoana||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/beant-singh-assassination-balwant-singh-rajoana-seeks-parole-to-attend-fathers-last-rites-364392
25-01-2022||New Delhi||Nitesh Rane moves SC against denial of anticipatory bail in attempt to murder case||Nitesh Rane—a BJP MLA in Maharashtra and son of Union Minister Narayan Rane—has moved the Supreme Court challenging the January 17 Bombay High Court order rejecting his anticipatory bail plea in an attempt to murder case.A Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Tuesday agreed to hear his petition after Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi alleged on his behalf that it was a case of political rivalry.“Upon being mentioned by Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel for the petitioner, we deem it appropriate to direct the Registry to list the matter on 27.01.2022 before an appropriate Bench,” the top court said in its order.Rane is accused of being the mastermind behind the attempt on the life of a Shiv Sena member on December 18 last year in the Kankavli area of Maharashtra.The Sindhudurg Sessions Court and the Bombay High Court had rejected his anticipatory bail plea. The Maharashtra government had assured that no coercive action would be taken against Rane till January 27, 2022 in order to enable him to approach the Supreme Court.Rane had submitted before the Bombay High Court that the FIR against him was because he had mocked Shiv Sena leader and State Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray and that the FIR was registered with the sole aim of preventing his participation in the December 30, 2021, Sindhudurg Co-operative Bank district elections.The state police contended that they had circumstantial evidence to support their case and they needed Rane’s custody to complete the probe.                                     #anticipatorybail                                     #attempedmurder                                     #murdercase                                     #NarayanRane                                     #NitishRane                                     #SC                                     #Shivsena||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nitesh-rane-moves-sc-against-denial-of-anticipatory-bail-in-attempt-to-murder-case-364390
25-01-2022||New Delhi||Intercourse in marriage can’t be labelled rape, wife cannot seek specific punishment to satisfy ego: Delhi HC told||Sexual intercourse between husband and wife cannot be labelled rape and at worst such an act of wrongdoing can be called sexual abuse, and a wife cannot compel the prescription of a particular punishment against her husband to satisfy her ego, an intervenor said in the Delhi High Court on Tuesday.Counsel for the intervenor NGO, Hriday, told the court, which is hearing a batch of petitions to criminalise marital rape, that in the marital sphere, sexual wrongdoing amounted to “sexual abuse” which was included under the definition of “cruelty” under section 3 of the Domestic Violence Act and indicated “any conduct of a sexual nature that abuses, humiliates, degrades or otherwise violates the dignity of woman”.Counsel R K Kapoor, representing Hriday, emphasized that the marital rape exception aimed to “protect the institution of marriage” and was not arbitrary or in violation of Articles 14, 15 or 21 of the Constitution.“Parliament does not say that such an act is not sexual abuse (any conduct of a sexual nature) but has taken it on a different plane to save the institution of marriage.“Wife cannot compel the Parliament to prescribe a particular punishment against the husband to satisfy her ego. The only difference in Section 376 IPC and Domestic Violence Act is the quantum of punishment, though the act of sexual abuse in both the cases has been deprecated,” the lawyer stated.“Sexual intercourse between husband and wife in marital relationship cannot be a labelled as rape and at the worst it can be called a sexual abuse only, which would be clear from the definition of cruelty as defined under Domestic Violence Act 2005,” he submitted.The bench of Justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar is hearing PILs filed by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association, a man and a woman seeking striking down of the exception granted to husbands under the Indian rape law.The petitioners have challenged the Constitutionality of the marital rape exception under section 375 IPC (rape) on the ground that it discriminated against married women who are sexually assaulted by their husbands.In an earlier hearing, the court had questioned that when the rape law granted no exemption in case of forced intercourse with a sex worker who chooses to withdraw consent at a belated stage, why a wife should be “less empowered”.Kapoor submitted that any comparison between the two was an “insult to the institution of marriage” and there cannot be any comparison between them as there is no emotional relationship in the case of a sex worker.“A perpetrator cannot claim restitution of conjugal rights against sex worker and correspondingly sex worker cannot claim regular maintenance from a perpetrator. There is no emotional relationship between sex worker and the stranger. The relationship between husband and wife is a package of a large number of mutual rights and obligations which are social, physiological, religious, economic etc. It cannot be limited to just one event of consent for sexual relationship,” he said.He further said that the offences concerning marriage stand on a different footing and the wisdom of the Parliament in retaining the marital rape exception should not be doubted when there are other sufficient provisions in the IPC and other statutes to redress the grievances of a woman.The lawyer also claimed that the legislature has classified several types of sexual offences under the IPC on the basis of a “number of incidental and collateral circumstances, the relationship between the parties and the age of the woman”, and the retention of the marital rape exception which is based on a “reasonable classification” cannot be found fault with.He also said that there are limitations on the powers of the court in matters of judicial review and when legislation has given protection to the citizen in the form of the marital rape exception, the court cannot take it away and enact a new offence.The court can only make a recommendation to the Parliament if some changes are required, he said.Senior advocates Rebecca John and Rajshekhar Rao, who were earlier appointed as amicus curiae, have contended that the marital rape exception is unconstitutional and ought to be struck down.The Delhi government has told the court that marital rape was already covered as a “crime of cruelty” under the IPC.The Centre has informed that it was considering a “constructive approach” to the issue and holding consultations with the stakeholders.The central government, in its earlier affidavit filed in the case, has said that marital rape cannot be made a criminal offence as it could become a phenomenon that may destabilise the institution of marriage and an easy tool for harassing the husbands.The hearing in the case will continue on January 27.                                      #MaritalRape||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/intercourse-in-marriage-cant-be-labelled-rape-wife-cannot-seek-specific-punishment-to-satisfy-ego-delhi-hc-told-364381
25-01-2022||New Delhi||India sees 61 pc drop in donkey population from 2012-2019: Study||Reduced utility, theft, illegal slaughtering and decreasing grazing land are among the reasons for a 61 per cent decline in the population of donkeys between 2012 and 2019, according to a new study.The study by Brooke India (BI), a chapter of the United Kingdom-based international equine charity Brooke, was aimed to understand the existence of the donkey hide trade in India.Field visits and interviews for the study were conducted in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Bihar, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, where a major decline in donkey population has been witnessed between 2012 and 2019, as per the livestock census.Increasing literacy rate, mechanisation at brick kilns and adoption of mules instead of donkeys for transportation purpose are also among the reasons for their decline, the study noted.It said Maharashtra witnessed a 39.69 per cent decrease in its donkey population in the eight-year period while Andhra Pradesh registered 53.22 per cent fall in donkey population.Rajasthan saw a fall of 71.31 per cent in these eight years, Gujarat registered 70.94 per cent fall, Uttar Pradesh 71.72 per cent and Bihar registered a decline of 47.31 per cent in the population of donkeys between 2012 and 2019, it said.The porous Nepal border and donkey fair, too, deny the perception that the country is free from the fangs of illegal donkey killings, it said.The study found that the illegal export of live donkeys, their hides and meat is being carried out across borders via easily accessible routes.“Traders and breeders of donkeys claim to know about the illegal transportation and purchase of donkeys. They are sure that the donkeys are not going to be utilised for general purposes such as transportation of goods and people,” the study noted.It investigated if the skin of donkeys is smuggled to other countries, especially to China for Ejiao, which is used in treating different types of illnesses.Quoting a local donkey trader, the study said that he was approached by a person from China a couple of years ago to buy 200 donkeys per month.“The Chinese man, who had approached him through a local man from Maharashtra, told him that only the skins of donkeys were wanted,” the study said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-sees-61-pc-drop-in-donkey-population-from-2012-2019-study-364375

After an argument broke out, the farmer dared the sales person to arrange for same day delivery of vehicle if he came back with the money within an hour.When he returned with cash, the salesperson could not manage instant delivery due to long waiting period. The farmer and his friends then demanded apology from the sales person as heated arguments followed and the police had to intervene.While the sale staff apologised, the farmer left saying he didn’t want to buy from the showroom. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mahindra-top-brass-promises-urgent-remedial-action-in-farmer-humiliation-row-364374
25-01-2022||Bhopal||MP: Dalit groom’s home attacked over marriage procession; 6 held||The home of a Dalit bridegroom was pelted with stones and ransacked allegedly by a section of local residents in a village in Madhya Pradesh’s Sagar district after he took out a wedding procession in an act seen as defiance against tradition, the police officials said on Tuesday.The police have arrested six persons in connection with the attack on the house of the groom in village Ganiyari under Banda police station limits of the district, some 200-km from the state capital Bhopal, in the Bundelkhand region on Sunday, an official said.Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Vikram Singh said some villagers allegedly pelted stones and ransacked the house of the groom.Following a complaint, 20 persons were booked under provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and six of them were arrested while some others are being interrogated, he said.Meanwhile, Home Minister Narottam Mishra on Tuesday said in Bhopal the police had received a complaint in which the complainant had expressed apprehension that some villagers may stop the groom from taking out marriage procession.“On getting information, the police reached the spot and a procession (which is called ‘rachh’ in local language) was taken out. The marriage procession then left for Katni (bride’s hometown). Later, some people allegedly pelted stones at the groom’s home,” he said.Mishra said police personnel have been posted in the village to maintain law and order and six accused arrested after the complaint.Dilip Ahirwar, the groom, alleged that members of his community are not allowed to take out a marriage procession in the village.He broke this tradition and this angered some villagers, Ahirwar claimed.The bridegroom said the marriage procession was eventually taken out with help of the police and Bhim Army workers.He said later in the evening his house was vandalized. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-dalit-grooms-home-attacked-over-marriage-procession-6-held-364371
25-01-2022||Naveen S GarewalHyderabad||Nizamabad MP hackled for failure to get turmeric board||Turmeric producing farmers in Telangana’s Nizamabad area who voted for Bharatiya Janata Party Member of Parliament Dharmapuri Arvind in the last Parliamentary elections for getting a turmeric board set-up in the area blocked his way on Tuesday and forced him to return due to delay the board set-up in the area.The BJP MP had defeated Telangana Chief minister’s daughter K. Kavitha, who had as sitting Nizamabad MP failed to get this demand of the farmers’ met.A turmeric board has been a long-pending demand for the region’s farmers. The farmers’ forced the defeat of the then sitting Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) K. Kavitha by fielding hundreds of farmers as candidates from each village to protest her failure to get the promised turmeric board set up here.Dharmapuri Arvind had to cut short his visit when hundreds of farmers obstructed his convoy and raised slogans demanding him to quit as their representative in Parliament because he failed to get a Turmeric Board approved. This they said was his election promise based on which they voted for him in place of the chief minister’s daughter.Telangana is the largest turmeric-producing state in the country, with four districts of Adilabad, Karimnagar, Nizamabad, and Warangal, mainly growing this spice. A study in 2017 put the turmeric cultivation during 2015-16 in an area of 42535 hectares that produced 184285 tonnes of spice. Most of the families in the Nizamabad district are dependent on the production of this spice.Since setting up a turmeric board is an emotive issue in the area, he was stopped around noon when Dharmapuri Arvind was on his way to Nandipet, near Issapally village in Armour Mandal, and a confrontation took place between turmeric farmers and the MP’s followers.Farmers demanded that he submits his resignation as MP as he had failed to fulfil his election promise based on which he won the parliamentary elections in 2019. They asked him to get a turmeric board in the district or quit Parliament.Some BJP supporters said that some politicians instigated the farmers, and the outburst was more due to political rivalry between the BJP and TRS rather than the issue itself. The farmers, however, have rubbished this saying they will not rest till they get a turmeric board in the area.                                     #BJP                                     #delay                                     #DharmapuriArvind                                     #heckled                                     #MP                                     #Nizamabad                                     #turmeric                                     #turmericboard||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nizamabad-mp-hackled-for-failure-to-get-turmeric-board-364364
25-01-2022||Islamabad||Pakistan slips further on Corruption Perceptions Index, ranks 140 out of 180 countries; India ranked 85: Report||Pakistan has dropped 16 spots on the global Corruption Perceptions Index for 2021 and is ranked 140th out of 180 countries, Transparency International said in a report on Tuesday, in a major blow to Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government which came to power on the promise of introducing a clean governance system.The report released by the Berlin-based non-profit organisation formed to combat global corruption said that corruption levels remain at a standstill worldwide, with 86 per cent of countries making little to no progress in the last 10 years.In its 2021 edition, the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), drawing on 13 expert assessments and surveys of business executives.In 2020, Pakistan’s CPI was 31 and it was ranked 124 out of 180 countries. According to Transparency International, the country’s corruption score has now deteriorated to 28 while it is ranked 140 out of the total 180 countries on the index.Comparatively, India’s score stands at 40 and is ranked 85, while Bangladesh’s CPI is 26 and stands at 147th position. Explaining the causes of low score of Pakistan, the report said the absence of the “rule of law” and “state capture” were the main reasons.The report comes at a time when Prime Minister Khan is under pressure to improve the performance of his government which came to power in 2018 on the promise of introducing a clean governance system.His adviser on accountability, Shehzad Akbar, stepped down on Monday amidst reports of his poor performance to bring the corrupt elements under the law.To add to Khan’s woes, Justice Nasira Iqbal (retd), Vice-Chair of Transparency International Pakistan, said the ranking of Pakistan under the PTI government has gradually come down.In 2019, it was 120th out of 180 countries, in 2020, it was 124th and in 2021 it worsened further to 140, she said.In contrast, in 2018, during the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) period, Pakistan’s ranking was 117 out of 180 countries.Former prime minister and PML-N leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi while addressing the media said that the report showed that the Khan’s government is corrupt and incompetent.“This government is the most corrupt government in the entire history of Pakistan,” he said, and demanded Khan step down immediately.The CPI global average remains unchanged at 43 for the tenth year in a row, and two-thirds of countries score below 50, the report said.According to the report, the top-performing countries are Denmark, Finland and New Zealand — all having a corruption perceptions score of 88 — followed by Norway, Singapore and Sweden, all of them scoring 85.In contrast, the worst-performing countries were South Sudan with a corruption perceptions score of 11, followed by Syria (13), Somalia (13, Venezuela (14) and Afghanistan (16).As anti-corruption efforts stagnate and deteriorate, human rights and democracy are under attack. This is no coincidence. The continued use by governments of the COVID-19 pandemic to erode human rights and democracy could also lead to sharper declines across the globe in the future, the report said.Transparency International calls on governments to act on their anti-corruption and human rights commitments and for people across the globe to join together in demanding change.“In authoritarian contexts where control over government, business and the media rests with a few, social movements remain the last check on power. It is the power held by teachers, shopkeepers, students and ordinary people from all walks of life that will ultimately deliver accountability,” said Daniel Eriksson, Chief Executive Officer of Transparency International.Since its inception in 1995, the CPI has become the leading global indicator of public sector corruption.The Index scores 180 countries and territories around the world based on perceptions of public sector corruption, using data from 13 external sources, including the World Bank, World Economic Forum, private risk and consulting companies, think tanks and others. The scores reflect the views of experts and business people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/pakistan-slips-further-on-corruption-perceptions-index-ranks-140-out-of-180-countries-india-ranked-85-report-364363
25-01-2022||Vijay MohanChandigarh||Punjab had highest number of drone incidents, recovery of arms and narcotics along Indo-Pak border||The international border in Punjab remains the most vulnerable stretch along the entire western front with Pakistan, with the highest number of drone sightings, apprehensions of intruders and recovery of arms as well as narcotics in the past year being reported in this sector.Of the 100 odd drone sightings reported by the Border Security Force (BSF) in 2021, as many as 67 have been in Punjab Frontier, followed by 24 in Jammu Frontier and six in Rajasthan Frontier, according to BSF sources. Gujarat Frontier and Kashmir Frontier reported two and one sighting, respectively.A senior BSF officer revealed that last year, there were 62 instances where enemy drones operating in the vicinity of the international border were fired upon by BSF personnel. These included 43 in the area of Punjab Frontier and 17 in Jammu Frontier, followed by two in Rajasthan Frontier.BSF data also showed that there have been 58 incidents of hostile drones crossing over into Indian territory, out of which 45 were in Punjab alone. There have also been instances of shot down drones being recovered by the BSF.BSF officers said the use of drones by adversaries as well as criminals in the border belt has increased over the past two years, posing new challenges.Extensive use of drones is being made by adversaries for surveillance of border areas and intelligence gathering. Similarly, this technology is being used by criminals indulging in smuggling of drugs, arms and other contraband items from Pakistan into India. BSF has been devising various strategies to counter the threat from drones.India, according to the Ministry of Home Affairs, shares 3,323 kms of its land border with Pakistan along the states of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.While the BSF is responsible for the peace time management of the international border from the Rann of Kutch in Gujarat to Akhnoor in Jammu, some of its battalions are also co-deployed with the Army along the Line of Control up to Kargil in Kashmir and Ladakh sectors.The length of the international border in Punjab is approximately 553 kms of international borders with Pakistan, comprising the districts of Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Tara Taran and Ferozepur.While most of this border is fenced and flood-lit, riverine stretches along the course of the Ravi and Sutlej are vulnerable and difficult to guard. This came into focus during the recent terror attacks in Gurdaspur and Pathankot.Among states sharing the international border with Pakistan, Punjab also topped in the number of arms being recovered. The BSF seized 54 weapons, including AK series rifles and pistols along with 3,322 rounds of ammunition in the area of responsibility of Punjab Frontier, followed by 17 weapons and 1,170 rounds in Jammu Frontier. No weapons were seized in Gujarat and Rajasthan frontiers.As far as narcotics are concerned, BSF data shows that about 80 per cent of seizures along the western border in 2021 were in Punjab. Out of the total of 599.220 kgs of heroin seized, 485.165 kgs was in Punjab, followed by 57.670 kgs in Rajasthan and 37.935 kgs in Jammu.Last year, the BSF apprehended 38 Pakistani nationals, including criminals and inadvertent crossers, out of which 28 were in Punjab. Four Pakistani nationals were apprehended in Rajasthan and three each in Jammu and Gujarat. In addition, six Pakistani intruders each were shot by the BSF in Punjab and Jammu, two in Rajasthan and one in Kashmir.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjab-had-highest-number-of-drone-incidents-recovery-of-arms-and-narcotics-along-indo-pak-border-364361
25-01-2022||Aditi Tandon||Our battle not for cowards: Congress after RPN Singh's exit||New Delhi, January 25Moments after senior leader RPN Singh joined the BJP on Tuesday, the Congress said the ideological battle it was fighting was “not meant for cowards.”Downplaying the exit of a UP heavyweight and former minister of state for home in the UPA government, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said, “It has been brought to my notice that the leader is quitting. I still do not know where he is joining….”She said the Congress’ fight was against government’s resources and agencies.“It is a battle of ideology, a battle for truth and to fight a battle as strongly pitched as this one you have to fight with courage. You have to fight with a lot of dedication. I do not think this battle is meant for cowards. Like Priyanka Gandhi has said, you need to be on your toes, you need to be full of courage. You cannot be a coward and fight this battle. From this platform, of course, I would like to wish him a glorified career ahead and the very best,” Shrinate said, quoting her leaders.RPN, 57, the sitting AICC in charge for Jharkhand, member of the Congress Working Committee and star campaigner of the party in UP (declared only yesterday) follows in the footsteps of young leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jitin Prasada, Sushmita Dev, Priyanka Chaturvedi and Lalitesh Tripathi who quit the grand old party for varied options.In fact, RPN served in the UPA council of ministers with Scindia and Prasada, who have both since joined the BJP. Scindia is union aviation minister and Prasada is a minister in BJP ruled UP.Although the Congress dismissed the exit, RPN, a prominent OBC leader from eastern UP, holds sway in Kushi Nagar which adjoins UP CM Yogi Adityanath’s parliamentary constituency Gorakhpur.A scion of the royal Sainthwar family of Kushi Nagar, RPN has been three time MLA (1996 to 2009) from Padrauna in Kushi Nagar Lok Sabha segment.The former Congress leader won the Kushi Nagar LS seat in 2009 and became a minister in UPA. He lost the seat in the 2014 and 2019 general elections.Considered close to the Gandhis, RPN became AICC secretary in 2003 having earlier been UP Youth Congress president.He fell out with the Gandhis of late and was known for speaking freely at CWC meetings. At the meeting held to discuss the Abrogation of Article 370 in J&K, RPN advocated sensing the public mood in favour of the move. He earlier argued that personal attacks on PM Narendra Modi were not helping.Much of Rahul Gandhi’s political offensive has involved attacking the PM’s image.Gandhi siblings have long maintained that those who want to leave the party can leave because they do not seem prepared for the long haul of an ideological battle.                                     #UPassemblypolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/our-battle-not-for-cowards-congress-after-rpn-singhs-exit-364359

If the petitioners have any other suggestion, they may file a representation before the authorities which may be considered on its own merits by the authorities,” the Bench said.Mehta also questioned the locus standi of the petitioner a US-based NGO saying, “I don’t know what’s the purpose of this PIL. Something is amiss,” he added.The FCRA requires NGOs to get a license from the Union Ministry of Home (MHA) authorising them to receive foreign funds.On behalf of the petitioner, senior Advocate Sanjay Hegde urged the Bench to extend the FCRA licenses of NGOs if they applied for extension in the next two weeks.However, the Bench said the petitioner may submit a representation to the authorities which may consider it on merits.Hegde submitted that to the best of the petitioner’s knowledge, the licenses of over 6000 organizations have been withheld. The bench observed that those NGOs may have chosen to not apply under the new FCRA regime following the recent amendments.The top court is yet to pronounce its verdict on petitions challenging an amendment to FCRA prohibiting transfer of foreign funds, requiring Aadhaar as identification for prior approval, registration and mandating opening of FCRA primary account exclusively in an SBI branch in New Delhi.On Tuesday, it said the NGO’s PIL will be considered after its verdict on the petitions challenging the FCRA amendments.The petitioner wanted the top court to issue a general interim order that all NGOs whose FCRA licence was valid as on September 30, 2021 ought to continue to be eligible to receive foreign funds until further orders. It sought a direction to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to exempt all NGOs from the purview of FCRA during the Covid-19 pandemic and quash the December 31, 2021 public notice to the extent it turned down FCRA licence renewal applications of NGOs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-extend-lapsed-fcra-licenses-of-6-000-ngos-364357

25-01-2022||New Delhi||PM Modi calls for higher polling, discussion on 'one nation, one election'||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday expressed concern over low voting percentage, especially in urban areas considered educated and prosperous, and said this should change in a vibrant democracy like India.In an interaction with BJP workers from across the country, Modi also raised the issues of "one nation, one election" and "one nation, one voters' list", saying that continuous cycle of elections result in politics being seen in everything while development works suffer.His address coincided with the National Voters' Day on Tuesday. While noting that the voting percentage rose from 45 per cent in the first Lok Sabha polls in 1951-52 to 67 per cent in 2019, he said the rise in woman voters participation was a good thing, but added that everyone from citizens to members of different political parties should think over low polling.It is seen that urban areas, which are considered educated and prosperous, have low polling, he said, lamenting that their residents discuss elections on social media but don't go to vote. Modi asked the BJP's "panna pramukhs" and other ground workers to work to ensure 75 per cent polling in every election. Polling is the most sacred donation to strengthen democracy, the prime minister said, lauding the Election Commission for its several initiatives to increase polling.Referring to the recently passed legislation which seeks voters to link their Aadhaar number and voter ID, he said it will boost transparency.  Pushing for discussion on "one nation, one election" and "one nation, one voters' list", he said let different point of views emerge. Even this interaction with BJP "panna pramukhs", those in charge of one page of voters list of a booth is linked to elections, he said, adding that he had been planning such an interaction for some time.Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur will be held in seven phases beginning next month.  The audio interaction was earlier meant only for Gujarat BJP workers but was later expanded to include party members from different parts of the country.Modi has often pushed for holding elections, from that of Lok Sabha, to state assemblies and local bodies, simultaneously, saying frequent polls hamper development works and make people impute political motives every step of a government.On the National Voters' Day, held to mark the Election Commission's foundation in 1950, Modi praised the poll watchdog and noted it enjoys wide support from different political parties and institution. The EC also enjoys powers like issuing notices and transferring officers, that its counterparts in other democracies do not, he said, noting that the makers of the Constitution knew that a lively democracy was possible only when there is a strong and unbiased electoral process.In his address, Modi also urged BJP workers to run campaign with people's participation against malnutrition so that a healthy India emerges by 2047, the centenary year of its independence. He also asked them to get more and more to connect with the BJP through its micro donation exercise.

We don't prostrate before our prophet and we believe in oneness of the God. "Surya Namaskar" is not allowed for Muslim students," he said."We also strongly advice Muslim parents and children not to participate in this idolatrous practice. This should also be an occasion to make children understand the concept of oneness of God and its demands. We urge the management of schools and institutions to respect this diversity and freedom of choice," he explained.The central government has issued instructions on the 75th Republic Day celebrations that special programmes to perform "Surya Namaskar" with musical instruments should be held across the country. The plan is to achieve a target of 75 crore "Surya Namaskar" across 30 states, 30,000 institutes by involving three lakh students. "We wish to say that "Surya Namaskar" is devotional Yoga practice involving prostration to the Sun and chanting of hymns. Islam strongly prohibits any act of worship or devotion to any of the creation," he said."Islam strictly recommends that is permissible only to the creator of the entire universe - Allah. Muslims are not allowed to prostrate even to the beloved personality of Prophet Muhammad. We have been asked not to perform Namaz, including prostration at the exact time of dawn or dusk to avoid any doubt of resemblance to sun worship," he explained.Hence it will be an infringement on the fundamental and constitutional right of Muslim children to expect or ask them to participate in this respect. The government should not enforce religious practices of one community on others since it is a violation of the secular principles and against the spirit of equality, justice and liberty, he said.The hijab row in Udupi College has resulted in resentment and a standoff between the Muslim girls and the management. The girls continued to be excluded from the classes till date. The right choice of dress, practice of one's religious belief is a fundamental and constitutionally guaranteed right which cannot be denied to any individual, he said.Hijab has never been an obstacle to identity and progress. To deny the same to the girl students at Udupi and as a result deny them dignity and right to education is highly deplorable. The issue should not be politicised and the matter should not lead to polarisation and hatred between the communities, he demanded.

Singh did not commit to whether he will contest from Padurana, saying that the call will be taken by the leadership, predicting a big win for the BJP in upcoming polls.Two other Congress leaders Shashi Walia and Rajendra Hawana, also joined the saffron party on Tuesday."This is a new beginning for me and I look forward to my contribution to nation building under the visionary leadership and guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president JP Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah," Singh said targeting the Congress.Praising PM Modi for the development work in UP with the double engine government, he also targeted the Congress. "I was with a party for 32 years, working hard with lagan and mehnat. However, it is no longer a party it used to be. For many years, many people told me to join the BJP. Today I can only say better late than never.”"I am proud I come from Purvanchal, what people there dreamt of has been realised there,” he said also praising law and order situation in UP.This is a new beginning for me and I look forward to my contribution to nation building under the visionary leadership & guidance of the Honourable Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi, BJP President Shri @JPNadda ji & Honourable Home Minister @AmitShah ji.  Today, at a time, we are celebrating the formation of our great Republic, I begin a new chapter in my political journey.

Jai Hind".Singh is believed to be upset with Congress leadership over his close associates being denied tickets in UP elections.Though he is believed to be looking at a more central role, the buzz is he may also be fielded from Padurana against Swami Prasad Maurya, who recently jumped ship from the BJP to Samajwadi Party.Singh hails from Padrauna and has also been a Congress MLA from thereDetractors, however, claim he moved to the central politics a long time back and "does not have much support in the region"The apart, the  shift is expected to bolster BJP's perceptions in UP, where it suffered major embarassment following the exit of leaders like Maurya, and dampen the spirits of cadres of the  Congress, which general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is trying to revive .Sources say the Congress is also keeping a close watch on Jharkhand, where Singh was the AICC in-charge. His shift to the BJP can also change the political equations in the state Singh helped the Congress to win.                                     #Congress                                     #RPNSingh                                     #UPPolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-ex-union-minister-rpn-singh-quits-party-says-new-chapter-amid-reports-of-move-to-bjp-364315

It said political parties should also be made parties to the PIL.Holding that freebies promised in poll manifestos vitiated the electoral process, the top court had on July 5, 2013 asked the Election Commission to frame guidelines to check it in consultation of political parties.On Tuesday, the CJI lamented that the EC has held only one meeting with political parties on the issue after the top court’s order. On behalf of the petitioner -- – a Delhi BJP leader, senior counsel Vikas Singh contended that the promise of irrational freebies from public funds before elections unduly influenced voters and disturbed level-playing field.Such freebies shook the roots of a free and fair election, and vitiated the purity of the election process, the petitioner submitted. Such promises by the political parties violated Articles 14, 162, 266(3) and 282 of the Constitution and amounted to bribery and undue influence under Section 171B and Section 171C of the IPC , he contended.“The injury to the citizens is extremely large because Punjab needs Rs 12,000 crore per month to fulfil the political promises if AAP comes to power, Rs 25,000 crore per month if SAD comes to power and Rs 30,000 crore (per month) if Congress comes in power, though GST collection is Rs 1400 crore only,” Upadhyay submitted."In fact, after debt repayment, the Punjab government is not able to pay even salaries-pensions, then how will it provide freebies? The bitter truth is that Punjab’s debt is increasing every subsequent year. The state’s outstanding debt has increased to Rs 77,000 crore, with Rs 30,000 crore accumulating in the present financial year itself," the PIL pointed out.“Political parties are prioritizing their self-interest over national interest and the public fund, which should have been properly utilized to secure fundamental rights of citizens, is being used to lure voters,” Upadhyay said, adding “Unless some mechanism is put in place, political parties would try to buy out the voters by hook or crook as their aim is only to ascend to power.”                                     #assemblypolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notices-to-centre-ec-on-pil-seeking-ban-on-irrational-poll-eve-freebies-364309

In western UP, the hotbed of farmers’ agitation against the now-repealed farm laws, the RLD is its key partner.Observers believe while Muslim votes will “easily transfer” to RLD candidates, the same may not be possible for SP’s Muslim candidates. In other words, the Jat votes may get divided between the BJP and the RLD and SP candidates may have to bear the brunt.However, SP leader Sudhir Panwar said, “Our alliance is three years long. Both SP and RLD leaders have utilised this experience in identification of issues and candidates for the poll.” Panwar, a star campaigner of his party, said, “The farmers’ stir has rekindled hope in different sections of society. The transfer of votes between SP and RLD candidates will not only be complete, but also smooth because of many factors. The first and foremost being historical as both parties draw their ideology from Chaudhary Charan Singh who formed alliances of MAJGAR, including farmer’ castes and Muslims. The farmers’ stir, in which both Jats and Muslims participated , not only cleared their differences but also provided them a common platform.” MAJGAR refers a caste combination of Muslim, Ahir (Yadav), Jat, Gujjar and Rajput, which suffered a major dent following the 2013-Muzaffarnagar violence.Samajwadi nominees opt for RLD symbolSP list of 159The SP released a list of 159 candidates for the UP poll, fielding party chief Akhilesh Yadav from Karhal in Mainpuri district, jailed leader Azam Khan from Rampur and re-nominating party MLA Nahid Hasan from Kairana||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sp-rld-alliance-may-see-splitting-of-votes-in-western-up-364213

This is just two days before Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold the first-ever such interaction with the five presidents.With China giving hot competition in Central Asia, India is attempting to ensure that its first-ever summit with presidents from the region does not become a one-off affair. India has proposed that such a summit be held every two years and is also willing to bankroll a secretariat based here to push the various cooperation proposals forward.China made a surprise announcement on Monday that its President Xi Jinping will chair a virtual summit with presidents of the five Central Asian nations to mark the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. This is exactly what Prime Minister Modi plans to do on January 27, with the programme having been decided at least a month in advance.This will be China’s first major diplomatic action with Central Asia this year and the first heads-of-state meeting between China and the five Central Asia countries. “The summit is of great significance for all sides to take stock of the achievements and experience of China-Central Asia relations, and seek coordination and make plans for future bilateral cooperation,” said the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs while making the announcement on Monday. It is extremely unusual to announce such a summit just 24 hours before it is due to begin.On the other hand, the India-Central Asia summit had been fixed much in advance. In fact, the five Central Asian presidents were to arrive here in-person to participate as joint chief guests for the Republic Day celebrations. But the spike in Omicron cases forced the cancellation of their visit and it was agreed to hold the summit virtually on January 27.India and the five Central Asian countries have a foreign minister-level mechanism that has met thrice on an annual basis. New Delhi has proposed similar ministerial level interactions on political issues and development cooperation, trade and connectivity, culture and tourism and defence and security.Beijing said during its summit, Xi and the five Central Asian presidents would adopt and release a leaders’ joint statement. “China is ready to work with Central Asian countries to deepen political mutual trust and expand mutually beneficial cooperation across the board so as to further upgrade the relationship and bring it to new heights,” said its Foreign Affairs Ministry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-rival-summits-with-central-asia-this-week-364197

In addition to taking ties to a higher level during previous Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s tenures, the Modi government has also initiated an “economic Quad” in West Asia consisting of itself, Israel, the UAE and the US.The logo that was launched by the two envoys features the Star of David and Ashoka Chakra and forms the numeral 30 depicting the 30th anniversary of bilateral relations. This special logo symbolises the strong friendship, love and admiration that exists between the people of Israel and the people of India. It also depicts the growing strategic partnership between the two sides.Both countries had launched a logo design contest last year for students of prominent design colleges in Israel and India.

Launching the poll campaign in the presence of Congress campaign head Harish Rawat, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel said the four promises were being made as price rise and unemployment were at their peak while the poor were getting poorer and the rich becoming richer under the present government at the Centre.Baghel said the present government’s policies were aimed at bringing more prosperity to industrialists at the expense of the poor and promised not to allow the LPG cylinder price to cross Rs 500 if the Congress comes to power in Uttarakhand.“In view of the problem of unemployment, the state Congress has decided to pay Rs 40,000 per annum to five lakh families of the state so that they could lead a life of dignity,” he said.Apart from this, four lakh people will be given jobs and medical services will be taken to people’s doorsteps with the help of drones considering the uneven topography of the state, he added.Recalling that states of Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand were created together in 2000, Baghel said he was confident that the Congress would form the government in Uttarakhand. — PTIHarish Rawat in fray from RamnagarNew Delhi: The Congress on Monday fielded Uttarakhand ex-CM Harish Rawat as its candidate from Ramnagar for the February 14 poll.

The first container service from this route will enter Iran’s Shahid Beheshti port on February 16, Deputy Head of Iran’s Ports and Maritime Organisation (PMO) Jalil Eslami has said.Regular container service with a traffic schedule of 10 to 15 days is performed by the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL). The PMO will offer the necessary tariff incentives and facilities on tolls and transportation costs to support the traders that use the lines, said a PMO statement.India had previously launched shipping lines between Chabahar and the Indian ports of Mumbai and Mundra in 2017. In January 2019, the second direct shipping route was launched. It passes through Mumbai, Mundra, Kandla, Chabahar and finally Bandar Abbas in southern Iran. India is using these shipping routes to transit goods to Afghanistan and Persian Gulf nations as well as the countries in Central Asia, the Iranian media reported. Through Chabahar port, India can bypass Pakistan and transport goods to Afghanistan and Central Asia, while Afghanistan can get linked to India via sea.Iran has awarded India the project for installing and operating modern loading and unloading equipment, including mobile harbour cranes in Shahid Beheshti Port in Chabahar.The first-ever India-Iran-Uzbekistan trilateral was held last month to develop communication routes with Central Asian countries.Pakistan’s denial of transit for India to Afghanistan and Central Asia has severely hobbled its drive to transform the age-old ties of commerce and blood into an enduring post-modern relationship between nation states of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.First service on Feb 16||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-bypass-pak-india-iran-launch-3rd-shipping-route-to-chabahar-364167

What’s the clarification sought I don’t understand…Dismissed,” a Bench led by Justice SK Kaul said rejecting the plea, filed by Syed Bahadur Abbas Naqvi – an intervenor in the case.Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the Supreme Court had on October 20 ruled that roads and public spaces can’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.Deciding petitions seeking removal of protesters against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) from Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, a three-judge Bench headed by Justice SK Kaul had said, “We have…no hesitation in concluding that such kind of occupation of public ways, whether at the site in question or anywhere else for protests is not acceptable and the administration ought to take action to keep the areas clear of encroachments or obstructions.”On February 13 last year, the Supreme Court had dismissed a petition seeking review of its Shaheen Bagh verdict.“The right to protest cannot be anytime and everywhere. There may be some spontaneous protests but in case of prolonged dissent or protest, there cannot be continued occupation of public places affecting the rights of others,” it had said.“We have considered the earlier judicial pronouncements and recorded our opinion that the Constitutional scheme comes with a right to protest and express dissent but with an obligation to have certain duties,” it had said.                                     #ShaheenBagh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-junks-plea-for-clarity-on-shaheen-bagh-verdict-364165
