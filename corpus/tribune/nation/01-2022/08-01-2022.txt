Further technical analysis is being done and forensic examination of devices is underway, police said."During interrogation, Bishnoi has revealed that he has the habit of hacking and defacing websites. He has been learning it since he was 15-year-old. He had hacked or defaced various websites of schools and universities of India as well as of Pakistan. His claims of hacking websites," Deputy Commissioner of Police (Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations) KPS Malhotra said.Bishnoi has an inclination towards the Japanese animated gaming character 'GIYU'.

"Lmao only one guy was ever involved and that's me. You pajeets arrested a follower of that acc with sikh dp, who had nothing to do with the app and didn't tweet anything wrong. Do you have even the slightest bit of shame slumbai pulis?" Bishnoi had said.Police said Bishnoi has further disclosed that he was in touch with the persons arrested by the Mumbai Police and used to chat through Twitter.He had never met those persons and even did not have their contact numbers.

He had also tried to harm himself twice and also threatened to commit suicide, police claimed.Due care is being taken care of him in custody. His medical examination has been conducted and he is stable and unharmed.

08-01-2022||New Delhi||Mandatory for parties to publish why candidate with criminal record selected for polls: EC||Political parties fielding candidates with criminal cases will have to mandatorily upload on their website details of such persons as also reasons for selecting them to contest the polls, the Election Commission said on Saturday.The poll panel on Saturday announced assembly election schedule for Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Manipur and Goa. The polls will be held between February 10 and March 7 in seven phases, with counting of votes on March 10.The political party concerned will then submit a compliance report with the poll panel within 72 hours of the selection of the candidate.If a political party fails to submit such compliance report with the Election Commission (EC), the poll panel will bring “such non-compliance by the political party concerned to the notice of the Supreme Court as being in contempt of its directions”. Following the directions of the Supreme Court in March, 2020, in successive polls, the Commission had been asking parties to furnish such information. It is mandatory for political parties (at the central and state election level) to upload on their website detailed information regarding individuals with pending criminal cases, including the nature of the offences and details such as whether charges have been framed who have been selected as candidates.The parties will also have to provide the reasons for such selection, “as also as to why other individuals without criminal antecedents could not be selected as candidates,” the Commission’s statement on the five assembly elections said.“The reasons as to selection shall be with reference to the qualifications, achievements and merit of the candidate concerned, and not mere ‘winnability’ at the polls,” the EC said.The information will also be published in one local vernacular newspaper and one national newspaper, and has to be uploaded on the official social media platforms of the political party, including Facebook and Twitter.These details will have to be published within 48 hours of the selection of the candidate and not prior to two weeks before the first date of filing of nominations.Candidates with criminal antecedents are also required to publish information in this regard in newspapers and through television channels on three occasions during the campaign period so that electors have sufficient time to know about the background of such candidates.

08-01-2022||New Delhi||100 new Sainik schools to provide opportunity to girl students to join armed forces: Rajnath||The government’s decision to set up 100 new Sainik schools will provide an opportunity for girl students to join the armed forces and contribute to national security, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Saturday.In an address at an online conference, Singh said the government is for increasing the role of women in the armed forces and a series of steps have been taken in that direction, including clearing the way for their admission in Sainik schools and providing permanent commission to women officers.The defence minister exuded confidence that the decision to establish new Sainik schools will encourage girls to realise their dreams of serving the country.Singh suggested that the department of defence and Sainik School Society should devise a mechanism for ranking all Sainik schools on the basis of their performance and audit.This, he said, will lead to healthy competition among the schools, besides providing encouragement to introduce innovative steps.He said, along with the curriculum, children should be exposed to patriotism and loyalty towards the nation as it will help in building their character and benefit the country.The defence minister described the announcement of the expansion of Sainik schools as one of the many important decisions taken by the government in the last six-seven years to improve the quality of basic education of children and ensure the holistic development of the country.“The setting up of 100 new Sainik schools will provide an opportunity to girls to join the armed forces and contribute to national security,” Singh said.In October, the Union Cabinet approved the affiliation of 100 schools from the academic year 2022-23 in government and private sectors with Sainik School Society under the Ministry of Defence.Singh stated that while ‘Sainik’ signifies unity, discipline and devotion, ‘School’ is the centre of education, therefore, Sainik schools are playing a pivotal role in making children capable citizens.Singh said the government is focussing on providing quality education to the youth of the country as it lays a solid foundation for the all-round development of the society.“Quality education is the fourth of the 17 sustainable development goals adopted by the United Nations. There are several other goals under ‘quality education’. It has been our strong political commitment to achieve these goals,” Singh said.“Several schemes like Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan are being run. Setting up of 100 new Sainik schools is another important step in that direction,” he said.Singh mentioned that Sainik schools have contributed to the recruitment of more than 7,000 officers in the armed forces so far and have given the country officers like former Chiefs of the Army Staff General Deepak Kapoor (retd) and General Dalbir Singh Suhag (retd).In this context, he also mentioned Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, former RBI Governor D Subbarao and film director Rakesh Roshan.“Today, our country is moving fast in the path of self-reliance in every field. It is touching newer heights in fields like defence, health, communication, industry and transport due to the synergy between public and private sectors,” he said.Singh said there is a need for a revolution in the education sector and the holistic development of children.“This is only possible if there is a strong collaboration of defence, education and private sector,” he said.

The entire country expressed concern over what happened in Punjab," Thakur told reporters here.The Punjab government did not take the incident seriously, he alleged.The law will take its own course now as the matter was before the Supreme Court, Thakur said.“But the way Punjab chief minister, the state Congress president, and other leaders made comments on this issue was sad. It shows what they think and how they speak about the prime minister," he said. "Moreover, it raises several questions and says a lot as the AICC president (Sonia Gandhi) and senior party leaders remained silent on this," the Union minister added.To a question, Thakur, who also handles the Youth Affairs and Sports portfolio, said the Mission Olympic Committee has already been constituted, and training is being imparted to sportspersons for the next Olympic games.As many as 1,000 centres would be set up in the country under the Khelo India initiative, and 250 of them have been already sanctioned, he added.The I&B ministry has taken action against Pakistan-based web portals which were spreading misinformation in the country, he said, adding that such action will continue in the future too.Earlier, Thakur participated in convocation at the Border Security Force (BSF) Academy at Tekanpur near here.During the ceremony, 78 officials including three women were inducted into the force as assistant commandants.Thakur urged them to dedicate themselves to the nation while working to protect its borders and also facing challenges of internal security. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-security-breach-union-minister-anurag-thakur-rues-statements-by-congress-leaders-questions-sonia-gandhis-silence-359429
08-01-2022||Chennai||TN political parties barring BJP to put up unified struggle to abolish NEET||Political parties in Tamil Nadu, except the BJP, on Saturday resolved to wage a unified legal battle to completely abolish National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to medical colleges in the State.A decision to this effect was taken at an all political party leaders meeting chaired by Chief Minister MK Stalin at the Secretariat here. The resolution passed by 12 political parties amid a walkout by the BJP states that NEET examination and the subsequent National Medical Commission Act have greatly affected the Tamil Nadu students by imposing NEET for admissions to medical colleges. "The Centre has deprived the State government of the right to decide on the manner of admitting its students to the State-run medical colleges. This is against State autonomy," the resolution said.  "NEET is the problem of Tamil Nadu - the problem of our students. .. In a country like India where the poor live, where there is inequality in the name of caste, the biggest and most difficult thing is to access education," Stalin said at the meeting attended by even the opposition AIADMK.  Abolishing entrance examinations makes higher education accessible to the poor and those with rural background, he argued. NEET deprived those sections of the right to education and the State is opposed to NEET as it is an impediment to the educational development of Tamil Nadu students. "How can we accept the two-hour exam called NEET after plus two? Isn't this social injustice? How many can afford to spend a huge sum for NEET coaching?" the Chief Minister asked.  He explained the circumstances prompting him to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi to exempt TN from NEET,  and recalled that the Assembly resolution seeking exemption from the test was passed unanimously on September 13, 2021. "We forwarded the bill to the Governor to be sent to the President for his assent. But the Governor had not sent the bill to the President,” he said and added that he had to meet the Governor in person and insist the bill be sent.  "This is a situation where the State's rights and the legislative power is under question that we have urgently convened this all-party meeting," Stalin informed.  NEET favoured those students who have access to coaching and it created the impression that the 12 years of schooling is of no use for admission to medical courses besides it renders the education system meaningless. "It not only shatters the dreams of the students but also destroys the principle of federalism," the resolution further said. "Not sending this bill to the President is considered unbefitting to the sovereignty of the legislature," the resolution said and mentioned about the efforts of the Chief Minister calling on the Governor to urge him to send the bill for Presidential assent. The Union Home Minister's refusal to meet the all-party delegation is against democratic norms, the resolution said and added that the delegation would meet the Union Home Minister if an audience is given. Senior legal experts will be consulted for necessary legal measures to completely abolish the NEET system which is shattering the higher education dreams of poor and rural students and disrupting the principle of State autonomy. Hence, it was resolved that all political parties would work in unison and make all necessary efforts to ensure a consensus so that other States in the country can realise the disadvantages of NEET, the resolution said. "Nearly 12 out of 13 political party leaders who participated in the meeting resolved to meet the Union Home Minister on demanding exemption from NEET and also to consult legal experts on how to proceed with the legal battle," Health and Family Welfare Minister Ma Subramanian said emerging from the meeting. The all-party delegation has planned to meet the Governor again to seek the nod for the Tamil Nadu Assembly Bill, he told reporters. Demanding a white paper on the status of admission of poor students to medical colleges and fee structure in and capitation demanded by the medical colleges before NEET came into existence, BJP Mahila Morcha national president and Coimbatore South legislator Vanathi Srinivasan said the DMK and other parties gave a picture that the BJP government  at the Centre had introduced NEET.  "It was introduced by the Congress-led UPA government in which the DMK was a constituent. The BJP does not agree with the NEET exemption resolution," she said after staging a walkout from the meeting. She claimed that 69 per cent reservation being followed in Tamil Nadu ensured social justice and the allegation that NEET was discriminatory does not hold water. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tn-political-parties-barring-bjp-to-put-up-unified-struggle-to-abolish-neet-359426

When wedding attendance has been limited to 20 people then the political rally attendance should also be capped by the Election Commission,” Bajaj said.Sugandh Ahluwalia, Chief of Strategy, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, said the most important thing now is to ensure that all Covid protocols are strictly followed by all voters.“No one should be allowed to vote if they have not been fully vaccinated. The EC should ensure social distancing at all polling booths. No voter should be allowed to vote without a mask. Temperature of the voters should be checked via infrared thermometers. While large-scale voting is important for democracy, it is also critical to ensure the safety of all voters,” Ahluwalia said.Dr Sajid Khan, a Noida-based endocrinologist, said those suffering from co-morbidities should specially take extra care.“This is a very critical time and the next couple of weeks are very crucial for the Covid situation in the country, hence it is advisable that extra caution is exercised by people, especially those suffering from co-morbidities like diabetes and hypertension,” he said.The Health Ministry on Wednesday said that India is seeing an exponential rise in the number of coronavirus cases, which is believed to be driven by its Omicron variant.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan, in his meeting with the poll panel on Thursday, also presented the overall global and domestic status of the spread of Covid, as well as Omicron, in the country. Details were also presented on the status of preparedness of the public health response within the states for control and management of the increasing numbers of Covid cases, the Health Ministry had said.

08-01-2022||New Delhi||India’s R-naught value recorded at 4, Covid-19 peak expected between Feb 1-15||India’s R-naught value which indicates the spread of COVID-19 was recorded at 4 this week, suggesting a very high infection transmission rate, according to a preliminary analysis by IIT Madras predicting the peak of the third wave between February 1-15.R-naught or R0 indicates the number of people an infected person can spread the disease to. A pandemic is considered to end if this value goes below 1.Based on preliminary analysis by computational modeling done by IIT Madras, which was shared with PTI, the R0 value was close to 2.9 nationally in the past week (December 25 to December 31). The number was recorded at 4 this week (January 1-6).Explaining further, Dr Jayant Jha, Assistant Professor, Department of Mathematics, IIT Madras, said R0 depends on three things—transmissibility probability, contact rate and the expected time interval in which infection can happen.“Now, with the increase in quarantine measures or restrictions, maybe the contact rate will go down and then in that case R0 can decrease. So, based on our preliminary analysis, which is just based on the last two weeks, we can tell these numbers, but again, these numbers can change based on how much affirmative action is taken with respect to social gathering and all,” he told PTI.The Union Health Ministry on Wednesday said India is seeing an exponential rise in the number of coronavirus cases, which is believed to be driven by the Omicron variant. It also highlighted that the country’s R naught value is 2.69, higher than the 1.69 recorded during the peak of the pandemic’s second wave.Jha said the ministry’s estimates are based on a different time interval than IIT Madras which has done the preliminary analysis from the past two weeks.He further said that as per their estimate, the peak in the current wave is expected to come between February 1-15 and it is expected to be sharper than earlier peaks.“What we expect from the exploratory data analysis is that the peak will happen somewhere between February 1-15 and our analysis also shows that as compared to previous waves, there will be a sharper increase to the peak,” Jha said.He said this wave will be different from the previous waves because of vaccination and factors like less social distancing seen this time.Responding to how it is estimated that there is less social distancing in this wave, he said during the first wave many restrictions were imposed but right now despite having a high number of cases there are not many restrictions imposed yet.“But the advantage here is that almost 50 per cent of the population this time has got vaccinated,” Jha added.The preliminary analysis has been done jointly by IIT Madras’ Department of Mathematics and Centre of Excellence for Computational Mathematics and Data Science headed by Prof Neelesh S Upadhye and Prof S Sundar.India saw a single-day rise of 1,41,986 new coronavirus cases, raising the tally to 3,53,68,372, which included 3,071 cases of Omicron variant reported across 27 states and union territories so far, the Union Health Ministry said on Saturday.

The ‘adverse  inputs’ harassed so many and then disappeared in two weeks. The POWER OF LOVE is stronger than the power of 56 inch.”Screenshot tweeted by O’Brien of the related page of the Home Ministry website showed Missionaries of Charity located at AJC Bose Road in Kolkata at serial number 688 in the list of FCRA registered organisations.The Home Ministry is yet to give an official statement on what prompted it to restore the MoC’s FCRA licence.Mother Teresa, canonized by the Vatican, has many admirers in the West and refusal to renew the FCRA licence of her charity infuriated them.

Compared to Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram, where the tobacco prevalence has been found the highest in the country at 58 per cent, only 1 per cent children use tobacco products in Himachal.Besides, the state has witnessed a significant decline in the use of tobacco among adults too. The survey in 2016-17 recorded a decline of 24 per cent in tobacco use from 2010. “If we go by the real-time data at present, the decline is roughly around 50 per cent. It puts us among the best performing states on this count,” said Dr Gopal Chauhan, state programme officer for tobacco control.The sharp reduction in tobacco use could be attributed to the programme’s success in reducing the exposure of smoking at home. “In the 2010 GATS survey, 82.5 per cent adults were exposed to smoke at home. Thanks to sustained efforts, the number came down to 32.9% in the second survey in 2016,” he said. Dr Chauhan considers the lowest prevalence of tobacco use among kids as the biggest success. “If we are able to keep a child away from tobacco in this age group, his chances of getting addicted later in life reduce significantly. Also, it is difficult to give up tobacco if one has started using it early in life,” he said.The other is that it considerably reduces the possibility of children going for some other form of substance use. “Tobacco is the gateway to the world of drugs. If we succeed in keeping youth away from tobacco, we will see less youth doing drugs,” said Dr Chauhan.

Some rating agencies fear that the rising Omicron cases may shave off up to 0.3 per cent from the GDP estimates for the fourth quarter. In actual numbers, the real GDP in 2021-22 is estimated at Rs 147.54 lakh crore against the provisional estimate of Rs 135.13 lakh crore.In other words, the NSO anticipates the GDP to grow by about Rs 12 lakh crore during the current fiscal. The numbers are still below the pre-pandemic levels. At this point two years ago, the NSO had estimated the real GDP for 2019-20 at Rs 147.79 lakh crore. This means at the end of the current fiscal, the real GDP will fall short of the performance achieved two years ago.The growth in GDP was mainly due to improvement in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors. “The advance estimates are more optimistic considering the supply bottlenecks, coal, power and semiconductor shortages and the looming third wave of the pandemic,” said analysts at Brickwork Ratings. Despite a shortfall in disinvestment proceeds and additional demand for supplementary grants, the fiscal deficit target of 6.8% of the GDP is likely to be achieved, the NSO said.IN FIGURES||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/economy-to-grow-at-9-2-nso-359162

A Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna, which had for two consecutive days heard the matter on applicability of Rs 8 lakh annual income criteria for determination of economically weaker section (EWS), passed an interim order, saying “there is an urgent need to commence the process of counselling”. It said that it is passing operative directions while the detailed reasons would follow shortly. “Counselling on the basis of NEET-PG 2021 and NEET-UG 2021 shall be conducted by giving effect to the reservation as provided by the notice dated July 29, 2021, including the 27 per cent reservation for the OBC (other backward class) category and 10 per cent reservation for EWS category in the AIQ (All India Quota) seats,” the Bench said.The top court, which passed five operative directions, said that the criteria for the determination of EWS notified by the office memorandum (OM) 2019, including Rs 8 lakh annual income criterion, will be used for identifying the EWS category for candidates, who appeared for the NEET-PG 2021 and NEET-UG (Under Graduate) 2021 examinations.However, the Bench said that the validity of the criteria determined by the Pandey Committee for identification of EWS would prospectively for the future be subject to the final result of the petitions. “The petitions shall be listed for final hearing on the validity of the EWS criteria as recommended by the Pandey Committee in the third week of March 2022,” the Bench said. — PTIHearing in MarchThe Bench says petitions shall be listed for final hearing on the validity of the EWS criteria as recommended by the Pandey Committee in the third week of March 2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/neet-pg-nod-to-counselling-sc-upholds-quota-359160

He survived by the grace of Mahadev (Lord Shiva). If a thorough investigation is conducted, it will not only unmask the role of the Punjab CM’s office, but also reveal that wires may be connected to the top.”BJP MPs held protests against the Congress near Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in the Parliament complex.

How could the SPG allow this?” said Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate.The Congress also said a new viral video of the January 5 incident showed that BJP supporters were in close proximity to the PM.“PM Modi is the sole SPG protectee in the country. The SPG reports to the PMO and the Cabinet Secretary. So we want to ask the government to make public all inputs, on which the SPG acted,” said Shrinate.She further said, “The time the PM was stranded on the flyover, the SPG had not even covered his line of sight as it is clear from the visuals.

Referring to statements by the Sikhs for Justice, he said it could be an issue of cross-border terrorism.The petitioners wanted the court to pass orders to fix responsibility of the Punjab Chief Secretary and the state’s Director General of Police and place them under suspension; and direct the Centre to initiate departmental action against them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/secure-all-records-put-probes-on-hold-sc-on-security-lapse-359154

The team found that Covid formed 29 per cent of deaths from June 2020 to July 2021 and of the 32 lakh deaths that were estimated during this period, as many as 27 lakh happened in April to July 2021, the time of the second wave in India.The researchers conducted an independent telephonic survey (done by CVoter) covering 1,37,289 adults in all states and UTs from March 2020 to July 2021.Questions asked included who died in the household and when and if the respondents thought the death was due to Covid or non-Covid. The answers were put together and analyzed.The study authors, including Prabhat Jha of the University of Toronto and Yashwant Deshmukh of CVoter, said, “Using an independent nationally representative survey of 0.14 million (1.4 lakh) adults, we compared COVID mortality during the 2020 and 2021 viral waves to expected all-cause mortality.COVID constituted 29 per cent of deaths from June 2020-July 2021, corresponding to 3.2M deaths, of which 2.7M occurred in April-July 2021 (when COVID doubled all-cause mortality). A sub-survey of 57,000 adults showed similar increases in mortality with COVID and non-COVID deaths peaking similarly.Two government data sources found that, when compared to pre-pandemic periods, all-cause mortality was 27 per cent higher in 2 lakh health facilities and 26 pc higher in civil registration deaths in ten states; both increases occurred mostly in 2021. The analyses find that India’s cumulative COVID deaths by September 2021 were 6-7 times higher than reported officially.”As of January 1, 2022, India reported over 35 million cases of SARS-CoV-2, second only to the United States. India’s official cumulative COVID death count of 0.48 million implies a COVID death rate of approximately 345/million population, about one-seventh of the US death rate.India’s reported COVID death totals are widely believed to be under-reports because of incomplete certification of COVID deaths and misattribution to chronic diseases and because most deaths occur in rural areas, often without medical attention.Of India’s 10 million deaths estimated by the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) in 2020, over three million were not registered and over eight million did not undergo medical certification.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-covid-mortality-maybe-6-7-times-higher-than-officially-reported-study-359100
08-01-2022||New Delhi||India among largest emitters could cause extreme climate impacts||The emissions of just five economies — India, China, the US, the EU and Russia — over the period 1991-2030 will double the number of countries experiencing extreme hot years every second year by 2030, according to a new scientific paper published in Communications Earth and Environment.The results highlight the outsized role these emitters play in driving warming and temperature extremes around the world.The study led by scientists at ETH Zurich and Climate Analytics looks at the impacts of these top five emitters over two periods: 1991-2030, and 2016-2030, over which they will contribute 52 per cent and 53 per cent of global emissions respectively.Under current emissions reductions targets, 92 per cent of all countries are expected to experience extreme hot years every second year by 2030, twice as many countries as without the 1991-2030 emissions from the top five polluters (46 per cent).Notably, 15 per cent of this increase would be attributable to the emissions of these five economies between 2016 and 2030, after the Paris Agreement was signed."Our work shows that over a relatively short-time period, the emissions of these five economies will have a strong impact on extreme heat experienced around the globe by 2030. We're talking about annual mean temperatures that would only be experienced once every 100 years in preindustrial times happening every second year", said ETH Zurich researcher Lea Beusch, lead author of the study.The paper also looked at the per capita emissions of these major emitters. It found that if all countries had the same projected per capita emissions as the US -- the highest per capita emitter in the group -- in the period after the Paris Agreement was signed (2016-2030), global mean warming in 2030 would be 0.4 degree Celsius higher than under current pledged emission reductions.This is a full 0.5 degree higher than if all countries followed the same per capita emissions trajectory of India, which has the lowest emissions per capita in the high emitters group.The study comes in the wake of the COP26 Glasgow Climate Pact that requests countries to revisit their 2030 climate targets to align them with the 2015 Paris Agreement temperature goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius."Our results underscore that the actions of the world's top emitters will have a huge impact on our global temperature trajectory in this decade. How they respond to the COP26 outcome will be fundamental to whether 1.5 degrees Celsius stays within reach -- none of their targets are currently sufficient", said Alexander Nauels of Climate Analytics, who co-authored the study.

08-01-2022||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court tells Punjab and Haryana High Court Registrar-General to secure all record on PM's 'security breach'||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 7Amid raging controversy over the security lapse during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Punjab visit, the Supreme Court on Friday ordered the Registrar-General of the Punjab and Haryana High Court to secure and preserve forthwith all records relating to the visit that had to be called off.“We direct the Director-General of Police, Union Territory of Chandigarh and an officer of the National Investigation Agency, not below the rank of Inspector General, to be nominated by the Director-General, National Investigation Agency, to assist the Registrar-General, Punjab and Haryana High Court, to forthwith secure and seize the records from the State police as well as Central agencies,” a Bench led by CJI NV Ramana ordered.It directed the Punjab Government, police authorities, the SPG and other Central and state agencies to give necessary assistance to the Registrar-General “in securing and seizing the records.”While ordering transmission of its order electronically to all concerned, the top court directed the Registrar-General, Punjab and Haryana High Court to keep the records in his safe custody for the time being.The order came on a petition filed by Lawyer’s Voice seeking a thorough probe into the lapse in the Prime Minister’s security during his visit to Punjab. The security breach happened on Wednesday when Modi was on his way to address a BJP rally and his cavalcade had to take a U-turn after some protesters blocked his way. The Prime Minister was reportedly stuck on a flyover for around 20 minutes.The Bench, which also included Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli, asked the committees set up by the Centre and Punjab not to go ahead with their respective inquiry for the time being and posted the matter for hearing on Monday. “We are not including this in our order, but ask both the committees to hold their operations till Monday,” the CJI said.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta clarified that the Centre’s committee was not meant to punish any officer from Punjab and that it was only for ascertaining as to why and how the security lapse happened.As Mehta termed it an issue of grave concern that has led to an international embarrassment, Punjab Advocate-General DS Patwalia said certainly there was a lapse and the State didn’t want to join the issue with the Centre or the petitioners.He, however, said both the Centre and the State committees should hold their horses till Monday. “We can proceed according to the directions of this court,” Patwalia said.Agreeing that it was a matter of grave concern, Patwalia said the state took it seriously and immediately set up a committee to look into it.“Mr Modi is our Prime Minister and even though this petition reeks of politics, we are not against it,” The Advocate-General said.Mehta said the records must be secured first and then the top court can decide the future course of action on Monday.Earlier, senior advocate Maninder Singh, representing the petitioners, demanded that the state’s committee should be stayed. Referring to certain statements of Sikh for Justice, he said it could be an issue of cross-border terrorism. Under the Special Protection Group (Amendment) Act, 2019, the Centre, states and other local bodies have to act in aid of the SPG, the unit tasked with PM’s security, he said, adding there was an “impermissible stoppage of the PM’s cavalcade, and this is the highest breach”.When Maninder Singh sought a stay on the functioning of the state’s panel citing some allegations against the panel head, Patwalia said, “If there are allegations against the judge we appointed, I cannot argue one way or another. The IG of SPG, who is a member of the Centre’s committee, was also responsible for this (security lapse) and can’t be a judge in their own case.”Mehta suggested the SPG Inspector General can be replaced with the Union Home Secretary.Terming it an “unacceptable” and “serious lapse” on the part of the Punjab government and the state police, the petitioners have demanded a thorough investigation into it under the supervision of the top court.The petitioners wanted the court to pass orders to fix responsibility of the Punjab Chief Secretary and the state’s DGP and place them under suspension; and direct the Centre to initiate departmental action against them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lapse-in-pm-security-sc-orders-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-registrar-general-to-secure-all-records-forthwith-359044
08-01-2022||New Delhi||SC allows resumption of NEET-PG 2021 counselling, upholds validity of OBC quota in admissions||The Supreme Court on Friday, in an interim order, allowed resumption of medical counselling for NEET-PG admissions for the year 2021-22 and upheld the validity of 27 per cent OBC quota.A Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna said that detailed reasons for the interim order will follow, and the counselling for the NEET-PG for the academic year 2021-22 will proceed as per the criteria already notified.“Counselling on the basis of NEET-PG 2021 and NEET-UG 2021 shall be conducted by giving effect to the reservation as provided in the notice dated July 29, 2021 including the 27 per cent reservation for the OBC category and 10 per cent reservation for EWS category in the All India Quota seats”, the Bench said.It said the submissions which have been made before this court over a span of two days necessitates a detailed interim order on the applicability of the EWS criteria as notified by Office Memorandum of 2019 for NEET-PG 2021.“The formulations of the reasons in the interim order on the EWS reservation would take some time. The validity of OBC reservation in the All India quota seats in NEET-PG and NEET-UG is upheld for reasons to follow,” it said.The Bench said, “We accept the recommendation of the Pandey committee that the criteria which have been stipulated in Office Memorandum (OM) of 2019 be used for 2021-22 in order to ensure that the admission process is not dislocated.“The criteria for the determination of EWS notified by OM of 2019 shall be used for identifying the EWS category of candidates who appeared for NEET-PG 2021 and NEET-UG 2021 examinations”, the Bench said.It added that the validity of the criteria determined by the Pandey committee for identification of EWS would prospectively for the future will be subject to the final result of the petitions.“The petition shall be listed for final hearing on the validity of EWS criteria as recommended by the Pandey committee in the third week of March 2022. Reasons shall follow,” the Bench said.During the two consecutive day hearing which started on Wednesday, the Centre had told the apex court that the introduction of OBC and EWS reservations after the issuance of NEET-PG exam notification does not amount to “changing the rules of the game” midway.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, had submitted that the submission of petitioners that OBC reservation is unconstitutional is legally unsustainable.Justifying the application of Rs 8 lakh income criteria for the EWS category, Mehta said the decision was arrived at after due deliberation by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.The Bench passed the interim order on a batch of petitions filed by the NEET-PG candidates, who had challenged a July 29, 2021 notification for the implementation of the OBC and the EWS quotas from the 2021-22 academic year on grounds that the Rs 8 lakh income criteria for determining EWS was without any scientific study.The Centre had constituted the three-member committee, comprising Ajay Bhushan Pandey, former finance secretary, VK Malhotra, member secretary, ICSSR, and Sanjeev Sanyal, Principal Economic Adviser to Centre, on November 30 last year according to an assurance given to the top court to revisit the criteria for determining EWS.The committee in its report submitted on December 31 last year to the Centre said, “The current gross annual family income limit for EWS of Rs 8 lakh or less may be retained. In other words, only those families whose annual income is up to Rs 8 lakh would be eligible to get the benefit of EWS reservation.”                 In its affidavit, the Centre has said it has decided to accept the recommendations of the three-member panel to retain the current gross annual family income limit for defining EWS at Rs 8 lakh or less. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-allows-neet-pg-counselling-as-per-notified-criteria-for-2021-22-upholds-validity-of-obc-ews-quotas-359031
