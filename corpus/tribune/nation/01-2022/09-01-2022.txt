In the first and second waves also, we had taken various stringent measures and that was the reason we could keep the infection rate less and casualties to the minimum. We will also tackle the ongoing pandemic confidently.”              “We make separate barracks for old inmates where we keep few young prisoners along with them. Temperature and oxygen level of these inmates are checked daily and if someone shows any Covid symptom, they are isolated immediately,” Goel said.All the new inmates will have to undergo quarantine for 10 days and mandatorily undergo the rapid-antigen test, the officer said.Social distancing among staff and inmates is followed to the extent possible. Inmates are mostly restricted to within their wards and an educational and awareness programme about following Covid norms are carried out regularly, officials said.The total number of prisoners in all the three jails of Delhi Prisons as of January 7 was 18,528. Tihar has a maximum of 12,669 inmates, Mandoli 4,018 and Rohini 1,841.As of January 8, a total of 34 inmates are Covid positive. Of them, 19 are from Tihar and 15 from Mandoli.

Jaishankar only posted about a “wide ranging conversation with my Iranian colleague” during which they “discussed the difficulties of Covid, challenges in Afghanistan, prospects of Chabahar and complexities of the Iranian nuclear issue”.In case the issue was taken up, it marks an expensive change of strategy. The Government would not be faced with the prospect of diverting all the wheat to the ports and arrange for containers at a time when their availability is tight and freight rates are high.Even if the costs are met, the conditions earlier cited by MEA officials for not transporting wheat via Iran still remain valid. The foremost is the reluctance among shippers and reinsurance agents to touch a consignment destined to Iran for they fear getting entangled in the web of sanctions announced by the US. Even if that reluctance was surmounted, officials had pointed out the lack of infrastructure in Nimroz province of Afghanistan to cater to the huge consignment of wheat. In contrast, entry points from Pakistan into Afghanistan had well-oiled mechanisms in this regard.A week back, the MEA had said, “In (the) coming weeks, we will be undertaking the supply of wheat and the remaining medical assistance. In this regard, we are in touch with UN agencies and others to finalise the modalities for transportation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-examines-other-options-for-wheat-to-afghanistan-359707

The NHAI also said it has no record of the number of complaints related to damages or bad roads on the 35-km stretch.“No separate budget is allocated for the repair for the stretch under the Brijghat toll plaza. However, a sum of Rs 5,39,72,337 has been spent on the maintenance and repair from Garhmukteshwar to Moradabad,” Rakesh Kumar Sood, the general manager-cum-project director for NHAI’s project implementation unit in Moradabad stated in the reply.According to information available on the NHAI website, the Brijghat toll plaza has a design capacity for handling 60,000 vehicles a day and had daily traffic of 46,360 vehicles in March 2017.

It will carry out a probe. If solid evidence against those involved is found appropriate action will be taken,” Garhwal DIG KS Nagnyal had said.Several Opposition leaders, including those from the Congress and the Trinamool Congress, have condemned what they said was a “hate speech conclave” and called for strict action against those involved.Also, retired police officers, including former DGPs of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, have written to Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami describing the Sansad as a blot on Uttarakhand’s long tradition of peaceful coexistence of different religions.

09-01-2022||New Delhi||Delhi govt looking at minimum restrictions so that livelihoods are protected: CM Kejriwal||The Delhi government on Sunday assuaged fears of migrant workers and businessmen, saying to protect livelihoods, its attempt is to impose minimum Covid restrictions and not a lockdown.The national capital in the past few days has seen a massive spike in daily cases, with migrants workers fearing a lockdown, like those imposed during the 2020 and last year Covid waves, could further dent their earnings, landing them into a severe financial crisis.Addressing a virtual press conference, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal stressed that the hospitalisation rate is low and that there will be no need of a lockdown if everyone wears a mask.“Rising Covid cases are a matter of concern but there is no need to panic. Very few people are getting hospitalised. Wearing mask is very important. There will be no lockdown if you continue to wear mask. There is no plan to impose a lockdown as of now,” he said.The Delhi government has already announced night and weekend curfews, among other restrictions, to check the spread of the coronavirus.Kejriwal said that he along with Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and the Centre is keeping a close eye on the Covid situation.“Our attempt is to impose minimum restrictions so livelihoods are not affected,” he said.Delhi on Saturday, recorded seven fatalities due to Covid and 20,181 cases as the positivity rate rose to 19.60 per cent, while on Friday, the city recorded 17,335 cases, the highest single-day rise since May 8, and nine deaths, with a positivity rate of 17.73 per cent. The figures on Thursday, stood at 15,097 fresh cases, six deaths and a positivity rate of 15.34 per cent.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain has repeatedly stressed that most Covid cases, this time, are mild or asymptomatic, not requiring hospitalisation.Delhi has reported six times lower hospital admissions due to the coronavirus this time as compared to the first wave of infections, he had said on Friday.There are a total of 48,178 active cases in the city, but only 1,480 Covid patients are in hospitals. Only 27 of them are on ventilator support, according to government data.Chamber of Trade and Industry chairman Brijesh Goyal and president Subhash Khandelwal said that businessmen are worried about a lockdown.The Omicron (variant of Covid) is not that dangerous. Many patients are recovering in home isolation, they claimed, adding that additional restrictions on markets will lead to financial losses to businessmen and their employees.Migrant workers said the situation so far has been manageable.“(Arvind) Kejriwal has said there will be no lockdown. A weekend curfew is manageable. I hope the situation doesn’t worsen,” Sudhan Mandal, 33, said.Working at a government construction project in Central Delhi, Mandal said he had returned home in West Bengal’s Malda district during the 2020 lockdown.“It had become really difficult to arrange food during the first lockdown. It instilled fear among migrant workers. In 2021, I was so scared that I left for home before the lockdown started,” he said.Swapan Jadhav, 35, a rickshaw puller from Jharkhand’s Sahebganj district, said families on the breadline would never want a lockdown.“I have six members in my family, including four children. I went back to my village during the two lockdowns, but I could hardly find enough work there too. I can still manage with a weekend curfew, but a complete lockdown will break our back,” he said.If a lockdown becomes inevitable, the government should take care of lodging and food, Jadhav said.Raj Kumar, 33, working at a government housing project site in Sewa Nagar, said that he and his co-workers were badly beaten up by police at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border when they were walking home during the first lockdown in 2020.“Once I reached home, the situation became worse. There was no work for days. I did odd jobs to eke out a living,” Kumar, a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal district, said.“I stayed in Delhi for the entire lockdown duration last year. There was no point being beaten up by police again and remain jobless at home. The situation is not that bad this time. I survived the second lockdown, I can survive this too,” he added.Mohammad Saleem, 53, said he has realised there is no point returning home again and again.“Earlier, people did not know much about coronavirus. Now, we have experienced it,” the rickshaw puller said. “I will sleep in my rickshaw if a lockdown is imposed again. My only request is that the government make arrangement for our food at least,” he added.The Maharashtra government has also said most of the cases in Mumbai are asymptomatic and bed occupancy rate is low, asking people not to panic.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday tweeted: “ I reiterate that we want to curtail unnecessary crowding but not impose any lockdown. The fact is that no restrictions will be effective unless we all adhere to Covid protocols.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-govt-looking-at-minimum-restrictions-so-that-livelihoods-are-protected-cm-kejriwal-359676

The bench, however, did not dictate it as part of the order, and had asked the counsels to convey its feelings to the authorities.The Registrar-General of the High Court will be assisted by the Director General of Police, the Union Territory of Chandigarh, and an officer of the National Investigation Agency not below the rank of Inspector General in securing the requisite records from the state government, its police and central agencies, the bench had said.The plea has sought a thorough investigation into the “breach” in Prime Minister Modi’s security in Punjab to ensure there is no such event in the future.It has also sought preservation of evidence on security arrangements, court-monitored probe and action against erring officials of the Punjab government responsible for the alleged lapse.

09-01-2022||Beijing||Former RBI Governor Urjit Patel appointed vice president of AIIB||Former RBI Governor Urjit Patel has been appointed a vice president of the Beijing-based multilateral funding institution AIIB, according to sources in the bank on Sunday.India is a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) with the second highest voting share after China. It is headed by former Chinese Vice Minister for Finance Jin Liqun.Patel, 58, will be one of the five vice presidents of the AIIB with a three-year tenure. He is expected to take over his posting next month.He will succeed outgoing vice president D J Pandian, who is in-charge of sovereign and non-sovereign lending of the AIIB in South Asia, the Pacific Islands and South-East Asia, AIIB sources told PTI.Pandian, who has previously served as the Chief Secretary of Gujarat, is set to return to India later this month.Patel had taken over as the 24th Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) succeeding Raghuram Rajan on September 5, 2016.Patel resigned in December, 2018 “on account of personal reasons”, saying “I have decided to step down from my current position effective immediately”.Prior to taking over on September 6, 2016, he was a Deputy Governor overseeing the monetary policy department at the RBI under Rajan and was known as his “inflation-warrior”.Patel has previously worked with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Boston Consulting Group and Reliance Industries among other organisations.Patel’s posting to AIIB is regarded as significant as India has emerged as its biggest beneficiary by obtaining USD 6.7 billion funding for 28 projects, Pandian said in his farewell luncheon interaction on Saturday.Also, the AIIB along with the Asian Development (ADB) is processing a USD two billion loan for India to purchase COVID-19 vaccines.Of the USD two billion loan, the Manila-based ADB is expected to finance USD 1.5 billion and AIIB is considering providing USD 500 million.The AIIB had recently granted USD 356.67 million loan for the expansion of the Chennai metro rail system. It is also considering funding several other infrastructure projects for the development of Chennai city and its suburbs.The bank has also funded the Bengaluru metro rail project.In his farewell interaction, Pandian sought to dispel the impression, especially in India, that the AIIB is a Chinese bank.He said that the bank now has emerged as a multilateral bank becoming the lead financiers of the infrastructure projects in Asia.Except the US and Japan, most of the developed and developing countries have joined the bank, he said.A readout on AIIB official website said the bank is a “multilateral development bank whose mission is financing the Infrastructure for Tomorrow—infrastructure with sustainability at its core”.“We began operations in Beijing in January 2016 and have since grown to 105 approved members worldwide. We are capitalised at USD 100 billion and Triple-A-rated by the major international credit rating agencies,” it added.

This includes my friends from the media, from whom I have learned a lot. I’m currently going through a rough patch but I’m sure that my friends and fans will see me through it.“It is with this trust that I would request my media friends to not circulate images of a nature that intrude my privacy and personal space. You would not do this to your own loved ones, am sure you would not do this to me either. Hoping that justice and good sense prevails. Thank you,” the Sri Lankan actor said in the statement.Last year, Fernandez was grilled by the ED multiple times as the agency suspects she is a “beneficiary” of the proceeds of crime allegedly generated by Chandrashekhar after conning and extorting money from some high-profile people.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/entertainment/jacqueline-fernandez-requests-media-to-respect-privacy-after-picture-with-alleged-conman-surfaces-359627
09-01-2022||Kochi||Models death case: Arrested interior designer granted bail by Kerala HC||The Kerala High Court has granted bail to an interior designer who was arrested in connection with the deaths of three people, including two models, in a car accident which allegedly resulted as he was chasing them in his four-wheeler.Justice Gopinath P, while granting the relief to Syju M Thankachan, said that prima facie and for the purpose of considering his entitlement to bail, the provisions of Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) may not be attracted even if all the allegations against the accused interior designer were true. According to the prosecution, investigation in the case has revealed instances of various other crimes, including those under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, committed by the accused and the CCTV visuals, including those of traffic cameras, show the manner in which he caused the accident.Thankachan was arrested in the case on November 27, 2021.Ancy Kabeer (25) and Anjana Shajan (24) had died in the fatal crash on November 1 last year.A third passenger, in the car, succumbed to his injuries a few days later. The driver, who escaped with injuries, was later arrested and is the first accused in the case.Thankachan is accused of stalking the models from a bar and later intercepting their car at Kundannoor in Kochi city. Later, the women sped away in their car to avoid him and he allegedly chased them in his vehicle, police had said.The state urged the high court that he may not be granted bail as he was very wealthy and influential and granting him the relief may not be conducive for his successful prosecution.It also told the court that if it was going to grant him the relief then stringent conditions may be imposed on him.Thankachan’s lawyer told the court that the driver of the car which met with the accident was in a highly inebriated condition and this alone could be the reason why he lost control of the vehicle and not because the accused was chasing them.The court, thereafter, granted Thankachan bail subject to his executing a bond for a sum of Rs one lakh with two solvent sureties each for the like amount.It also directed him to appear before the Investigating Officer of the case on every Monday and Saturday at 9 AM and not to leave the local limits of Ernakulam District without permission from the jurisdictional court.

09-01-2022||New Delhi||State polls: Will SP, TMC, AAP, Akalis, BSP be successful in providing a non-BJP, non-Congress alternative ahead of 2024?||The elections to the five states will also test the potential of several regional players, including the Aam Aadmi Party, the Samajwadi Party, the Rashtriya Lok Dal, the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Akali Dal, and the Trinamool Congress of providing a non-BJP, non-Congress alternative in political strategies ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The results will also confirm whether the minority Muslim and anti-BJP vote banks stacked up against the saffron party or split to its advantage, say observers. Punjab, meanwhile, will also test the potential of farmers as a political force.      Importantly, the next few weeks will also check the politics and potential of two non-Congress, non-BJP Chief Ministers outside their comfort zones — Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal and his West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee and their ambitions.  Uttar Pradesh will reveal if former CM Akhilesh Yadav’s strategy of forming alliances with small, caste-based parties emerged resilient against the powerful poll machinery of the ruling BJP and the combined strength of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi AdityanathWhile the SP is drawing crowds in UP, AAP has emerged as a strong challenger in Punjab and a talking point in Uttarakhand, UP, and Goa. In fact, sources are indicating a “tough road” for the BJP in two states in specific, Punjab and Uttarakhand, among the five states.  While Mayawati-led BSP is said to be on shaky ground in UP, it has an alliance with the Akali Dal in Punjab, which will witness a five cornered contest with Sanyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM)-Samaj Morcha (SSM), the Congress, the AAP, and the BJP-Punjab Lok Congress-SAD(Sanyukt) alliance.Meanwhile, Mamata Banerjee is trying her luck for the first time in Goa. In power for 10 years, this is the first Assembly election the BJP will be contesting in the absence of its popular leader, late Manohar Parrikar. Like Sikhs in Punjab, in Goa too the BJP has been trying to woo Catholics, who constitute a third of the population there.Interestingly, the fourth angle of the Goa story, the Congress, believes the AAP and the TMC are “marginal players”.  The AAP tested the waters in 2017 but failed to make an impact, Congress leaders say, claiming a “complete lack of local support for the TMC”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/state-polls-will-sp-tmc-aap-akalis-bsp-be-successful-in-providing-a-non-bjp-non-congress-alternative-ahead-of-2024-359611

Punjab, meanwhile, will also test the potential of farmers as a political force While the BJP is defending existing governments in UP, Uttarakhand, Manipur and Goa, in Punjab, it is trying to emerge on its own in a new avatar minus the Akali Dal.Will reflect Priyanka’s leadership skillsFor the Congress, meanwhile, Punjab elections are important from the point of fundamental existence in the face of a tough challenge from the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP.Notably, Congress’ 20 per cent seats in the Lok Sabha come from Punjab. Likewise, of the BJP’s total Lok Sabha seats, almost 20 per cent are from Uttar Pradesh. Not just the Congress needs to return to power in Punjab, it also has to make a decent breakthrough in other states to remain relevant.For the saffron party, the biggest challenge is Uttar Pradesh, where the results also have the potential to affect Presidential elections scheduled later this year.Any dent in the Assembly elections, particularly in UP, may affect the number game of the BJP in the electoral college. With 403 seats, the UP Assembly accounts for a vote value of 83,824 — that is around 15.25 per cent of MLAs in the electoral college.For the party that banks on optics and popularity of PM Modi, the digital format of electioneering is expected to be more beneficial for the BJP given its deep-rooted party network and strong booth management.While the SP is drawing crowds in UP, the AAP has emerged as a strong challenger in Punjab and a talking point in Uttarakhand, UP and Goa.Observers say elections will also answer several questions that will affect the politics across the country.If the Congress returns in Punjab, the win will be attributed to Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/state-polls-crucial-test-not-just-for-bjp-cong-but-regional-forces-too-359460

The study authors said Covaxin was the first in India to report safety and immunogenicity results from a booster clinical trial — a phase-2 double-blind, randomised controlled trial.The analysis showed six months after a two-dose BBV152 vaccination series cell-mediated immunity and neutralising antibodies to both homologous and heterologous strains (Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Delta plus) persisted above baseline, although the magnitude of the responses had declined.Furthermore, neutralising antibodies against homologous (same dose) and heterologous (mixed dose) SARS-CoV-2 variants increased 19 to 265 fold after a third vaccination.Booster BBV152 vaccination is safe and may be necessary to ensure persistent immunity to prevent breakthrough infections, researchers said, adding neutralisation titers against the wild type and Delta variants was five times higher than after a two-dose schedule.Over 2 crore adolescents get first doseNew Delhi: More than 2 crore children aged 15 to 18 years have received the first dose of Covid-19 within five days of the commencement of Covid inoculation drive for children. India has overall administered 1,50,61,92,903 doses. More than 91 per cent of the adults have now been covered with the first dose and over 66 per cent have been fully inoculated.

Jinko, Longi and Trina Solar, the major suppliers of modules to Indian renewable energy developers, have not heard from officials, thus automatically excluding them from the approved list.Covid curbs boomerangThe examiner, National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE), has reported travel restrictions with China as the inhibiting factor. The agency remained unresponsive to pleas for a global third party audit of the facilities and products of Chinese manufacturers.China has imposed a tough policy for admitting visitors in order to check the Covid pandemic. But Chinese companies who wanted to invite Indian inspectors for checks have been inadvertent victims.Till the time cheaper Chinese modules arrive, solar tariff is expected to range between Rs 2 and Rs 2.8 per kilowatt hour, but the expectation is that the prices may rise to Rs 3.5 or even to Rs 4 as the only suppliers left in the field are domestic manufacturers. The government also intends imposing a basic Customs duty of 40 per cent on solar panel imports in the coming budget.India plans to achieve 175 GW of renewable targets by December 2022 and 450 GW by 2030. In April 2020, the government had mandated compulsory registration of manufacturers of solar panels to be eligible to participate in government solar tenders in order to set a quality benchmark for procurement of solar panels and cells.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-firms-excluded-from-panel-of-approved-solar-module-makers-359457

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh have met their Chinese counterparts abroad, notably in Russia in September 2020, but no intervention has been welcomed or allowed. That stance will continue. The ongoing talks notwithstanding, matters at the LAC could take a turn any way, even move towards a lingering and constant deployment by both countries, as per an assessment in security circles. The newly created infrastructure comprising roads, bridges, expansion of airstrips, shelters from fighter jets and military bases will not go away. It will remain at the LAC and so will be the new dual-use villages made by China close to the LAC on its side. All this means ability to quickly deploy by both sides.India-US 2+2 talks likely in MarchChina is just not keen on demarcating the LAC and defining a border and till that is done a long-standing resolution will not be possible. The LAC is undefined and undemarcated. The Chinese have dithered on its alignment on ground. Commanders of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have been shifting goalposts even for the existing pullback from the LAC.The military commanders are slated to meet on January 12. The agenda will be pullback from the military posturing along the 832-km LAC in eastern Ladakh. The existing impasse is over PP 15, also referred to as Hot Springs, besides Depsang Bulge, a 972-sq-km plateau.India wants a three-step process to be followed. The first is disengagement from areas where troops are within close proximity. The next two steps, de-escalation and de-induction, would entail pulling back troops and equipment to the pre-April 2020 levels. Till that is agreed upon and complied, it cannot be assumed to be business as usual.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/troop-deployment-infra-build-up-at-lac-new-normal-359456

If the BJP wins Uttar Pradesh, Adityanath will emerge as a strong contender as a successor to PM Modi in future.If the Congress returns in Punjab, the win will be attributed to Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who affected the leadership changes in the state, replacing Amarinder Singh with Charanjit Singh Channi.

The video was readily available on various news portals and social media platforms, a senior police officer said.“With the ill-intent to promote enmity and instigate communal disharmony, the video was morphed and a new voiceover was super imposed in which the alleged persons tried to show that the meeting was against the Sikh community,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (IFSO) K P S Malhotra had said.The city police had registered a case under section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) of the Indian Penal Code and investigation was initiated, police said.Primarily, two Twitter accounts -- @simrankaur0507 and @eshalkaur1-- were identified which had started the propagation of the video in question, they said.During technical investigation, it was noticed that there were various accounts, which had tweeted the same video with the same content and hashtag, police said.All the accounts were created between October to December last year. The technical analysis has been revealed that these accounts were being operated from a single browser (developed by multilogin.com), police said.Multilogin provides Mimic browser and stealthfox browser, which has features of multi sessions and private sessions. The technical analysis had pointed that these accounts are being used from Pakistan. These 46 accounts are being blocked, police said.Meanwhile, the Delhi Police took Twitter and urged people not to spread rumours and forward such videos.“#DelhiPolice urges you to not spread rumours and forward videos that are not authentic in time and space. Any attempt to create disharmony will face action as per law,” it tweeted.

Your silence, honourable prime minister, emboldens the hate-filled voices and threatens the unity and integrity of our country,” it said.“We ask your leadership to turn our minds and hearts, as a nation, away from inciting hatred against our people. We believe that a society can focus on creativity, innovation, and growth, or society can create divisions within itself,” it added.They urged him to steer the country away from “forces that seek to divide us”.The letter said the signatories wanted to build an India that stood as an exemplar of inclusiveness and diversity in the world and expressed hope that Modi will lead the country in making the right choices.It noted that the Constitution gave people the right to practice their religion with dignity, without fear and without shame.“There is a sense of fear in our country now. Places of worship, including churches in recent days, are being vandalised, and there have been calls to take arms against our Muslim brothers and sisters. All of this is carried out with impunity and without any fear of due process,” it added.
