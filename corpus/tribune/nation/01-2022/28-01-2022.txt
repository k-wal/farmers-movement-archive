28-01-2022||Kota||Priyanka Gandhi urges Modi to facilitate repatriation of body of Rajasthan man who died in Russia||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to facilitate the repatriation of the mortal remains of a tribal man from Rajasthan who died in Moscow last year, saying his daughter wants to see her father one last time.The Congress general secretary on Friday shared on Twitter a copy of her letter to the prime minister dated January 27. She also posted a photo with the daughter of the tribal man, Hitendra Garasia, who hailed from Godwa village in Rajasthan’s Udaipur district.In her letter, Vadra said the family of Garasia, who died in Russia on July 17, 2021, has been demanding that his mortal remains be brought back to India so that his last rites can be conducted respectfully.“Showing great courage, the daughter of late Hitendra Garasia even appealed to your (prime minister’s) office. She wants to see her father one last time. But so far, no action has been taken in the matter,” the Congress leader said.Gandhi further requested Modi to take serious note of this issue.Garasia’s wife Asha Devi, daughter Urvashi and son Piyush, accompanied by Bundi-based Congress leader Charmesh Sharma, met Vadra at her office in Delhi earlier this week.According to Sharma, Vadra assured the family that she will take care of them in future.AICC secretary and former MLA from Jahazpur in Rajasthan Dheeraj Gurjar was also present at the meeting.Garasia had gone to Russia in April 2021 on a one-year work visa but was reportedly found dead in a park in Moscow. The Moscow Police closed the case as an accidental death. Later, the body was buried in Moscow.Garasia’s family was informed about his death by the local police on August 28, 2021. Since then, his family has been trying to get his mortal remains back to India.The family moved the Rajasthan High Court in December last year. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priyanka-gandhi-urges-modi-to-facilitate-repatriation-of-body-of-rajasthan-man-who-died-in-russia-365033

28-01-2022||New Delhi||Beijing concern over DRI raids on Xiaomi, Oppo||Beijing has expressed concern over the raids earlier this month on Chinese mobile phone companies in India and sought a “fair, transparent and non-discriminatory environment” for Chinese enterprises.The concern over the “business environment’’ in India by Gao Feng, spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce, was made after the Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) launched a probe into tax and income issues of Chinese mobile companies such as Oppo, Xiaomi, and OnePlus.The DRI had slapped a preliminary demand of Rs 653 crore on Chinese mobile phone giant Xiaomi for not including royalty payments in the assessable value of the goods it imported over three years from 2017 to 2020. It had claimed to have acted upon intelligence that Xiaomi India was evading customs duty by undervaluation.Its searches led to the recovery of incriminating documents indicating that Xiaomi was remitting royalty and licence fee to Qualcomm US and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software. But this was not being added in the assessable value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers.Xiaomi said it is being asked to pay import taxes on the royalty and license fees that are not related to its current business while noting that it is not a final decision.“China has contributed to Indian economic development, and created a large number of local jobs, and we hope India can provide a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese businesses,’’ said Gao.Terming the DRI investigation as an “irregular tax audit’’, the Chinese newspaper Global Times said Chinese mobile phone brands are highly popular in the Indian market, and their market share far exceeds that of local Indian brands. Xiaomi led the Indian smartphone market shipments in the third quarter of 2021 holding a 22 per cent share, per Counterpoint’s latest research. The total Indian smartphone shipments crossed 52 million units in the third quarter, and while Xiaomi is on top, it said quoting an Indian survey.                                     #China                                     #DRIraids                                     #Oppo                                     #Xiaomi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/beijing-concern-over-dri-raids-on-xiaomi-oppo-365028
28-01-2022||Vibha SharmaNew Delhi||Battleground UP: Amit Shah's invitation to RLD aimed at isolating Jats, say Akhilesh Yadav, Jayant Chaudhary||Ally Jayant Chaudhry by his side, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Friday launched a scathing attack against the ruling BJP from Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, accusing it of deliberately delaying his helicopter in Delhi “without any reason” and calling it “losing BJP’s conspiracy and a proof of their frustration”.Yadav and Chaudhary also denied the buzz about any post-poll alliance between the BJP and the Rashtriya Lok Dal, calling Home Minister Amit Shah’s statement “proof of desperation” in the ruling camp because of the ground situation.“Unka nyota maan kaun raha hai…sochiye kaise halaat hain unki ki nyota dena pad raha hai. (Who is accepting their invitation…just think about their situation that they have to send such an invite,” Yadav said.Meanwhile, terming the SP-RLD alliance “solid as a rock”, Jayant called Shah’s invite “mischievous and aimed to mislead and isolate Jats’, a politically significant vote bloc in Western UP which his party, the RLD, represents.“Our alliance is solid and aimed at furthering the cause of farmers, “ said Chaudhary who yesterday created quite a flutter saying “main koi chavanni nhi hoon ke palat jaun, ye mann samman ki ladai hai”.Yadav also claimed that “a historic SP-RLD win will wipe out the BJP in UP”.While the buzz is that feelers, including an offer of a berth in the Centre, were sent to Chaudhary by the BJP to “consolidate Jat votes”, all of it has been denied by the RLD leader. “It is a mischievous attempt (by BJP) to create problems and confusion,” he said.        Interestingly, while Shah has been breathing fire against the SP and Mayawati-led BSP, his “soft” approach towards Chaudhary has set off a myriad of speculations. Yadav, meanwhile, also asked farmers to be wary of the BJP, saying the Centre had withdrawn the controversial farm laws only for the sake of votes. “The BJP promised to double the income of farmers but it brought the three anti-farmer laws. The farmers forced the government to repeal the laws. The BJP rolled back the laws for the sake of votes,” the SP chief said.Jats are a deciding factor in almost all seats in western UP, the region where the RLD enjoys influence among the community. The SP and the RLD are trying to revive MAJGAR, the caste combination of Muslim, Ahir (Yadav), Jat, Gujjar and Rajput, which suffered a major dent following the 2013-Muzaffarnagar violence.Yadav said the SP-RLD alliance was headed for a historic win and the BJP was using every possible ploy to divert attention from real issues. “We are sons of farmers and have joined hands to save the legacy of Chaudhary Charan Singh. We would lay our lives for the cause of farmers and save the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb of the region,” said Yadav, taking a pledge over food grains with Chaudhary. “Those who are talking of palayan (exodus) we will ensure their political exodus from UP in March,” he said.                                     #AkhileshYadav                                     #AmitShah                                     #JayantChaudhary                                     #RLD                                     #SP,                                     #UPPolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/battleground-up-akhilesh-yadav-jayant-chaudhary-preset-united-front-says-shas-invitation-to-rld-aimed-at-isolating-jats-365025
28-01-2022||New Delhi||Soon, no fuel without valid pollution-under-check certificate in Delhi: Govt||Having a valid pollution-under-check certificate will soon be made mandatory for refuelling vehicles at fuel pumps in the national capital.The city government will put a draft policy in this regard in the public domain for inviting suggestions and objections.Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the policy will help ensure that polluting vehicles do not ply in Delhi and residents enjoy cleaner air.Reena Gupta, advisor to the minister, said the policy affirms the commitment of the Kejriwal government towards ensuring clean air for all citizens of Delhi.“Vehicle owners will have to carry their PUCC to the fuel pump. In case the PUCC is found invalid, they will have to get it reissued at the pump,” a statement said.“This is a very ambitious policy. North India including Delhi face grave air pollution particularly in winter. With this policy in place, vehicles will be mandated to have their PUC certificate with them at the fuelling station. Thus, pollution levels of vehicles in the state will be kept in check from time to time,” the statement quoted Rai as saying.The government is also working on technology-based measures for effective implementation of the policy to ensure that vehicle owners as well as petrol pump owners do not face any inconvenience and there are no long queues because of checking of PUC certificates.While the exact mechanisms are being worked out, these methods can also include technologies like radio-frequency identification systems.Earlier this month, the Delhi government had issued a draft Motor Vehicle Aggregators Scheme, 2021, calling on online passenger and commercial vehicle operators to increasingly adopt electric vehicles.In August 2020, the government had introduced Delhi Electric Vehicles policy which aims at increasing the EV share in total vehicle sales to 25 percent by 2024.In October last year, the city government launched a massive drive to check PUC certificates and deployed around 500 teams at petrol pumps for this purpose.Under Section 190(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1993, vehicle owners not having a valid PUC can be fined up to Rs 10,000, or imprisoned for up to six months or both. The owners are required to get their vehicles tested to ascertain if they meet emission standards for pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide.There are 966 authorised pollution checking centres in the city.The city government had earlier announced that it will deregister all diesel vehicles which completed 10 years on January 1, 2022, and issue a no-objection certificate (NOC) so that they can be re-registered in other places.However, no NOC will be issued for diesel vehicles that have completed 15 years or more on the date of applying for it, according to an order issued earlier this month.The government also implemented the “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” campaign during winter to cut down vehicular pollution.Under the campaign launched on October 16, 2020, drivers are encouraged to switch off their vehicles while waiting for the traffic light to turn green.As per government estimates, the transport sector accounts for 28 per cent of the PM2.5 emissions in Delhi. Vehicular contribution also makes up 80 per cent of nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide in Delhi’s air.A total of 1.33 crore vehicles are registered in Delhi currently. The count of vehicles in the national capital more than doubled to 643 per thousand population in 2019-20 from 317 in 2005-06. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/soon-no-fuel-without-valid-pollution-under-check-certificate-in-delhi-govt-365024
28-01-2022||New Delhi||SKM to mark January 31 as 'betrayal day', will ask Uttar Pradesh to 'punish BJP'||Samyukta Kisan Morcha on Friday upped the ante against the central government saying it would mark January 31 as a day of betrayal given the non-fulfilment of promises the BJP ruled Centre made to farmers of the country on December 9, 2021, leading to farmers ending their year-long sit in at Delhi borders.SKM also said it would jointly appeal to the people of election-bound Uttar Pradesh to “punish the BJP” saying its “Mission UP” will enter a new phase and details would be announced on February 3.The umbrella body of farmer organizations met today and called upon farmers across India to mark “Vishwasghat Diwas” on January 31.In a statement, SKM said protests will be organised at 500 districts of India on January 31 and a memorandum will be presented to the government for its failure to keep the promises made earlier.SKM said that despite written assurances by the union agriculture secretary in a December 9, 2021 letter, cases lodged during the agitation had not been withdrawn, compensation had not been paid to affected families who lost their kin and the promised committee to discuss MSP had not been announced.“We call upon farmers to raise their voice against the government,” SKM leaders Darshan Pal, Hannan Mollah, Jagjit Singh Daddewal, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Shiv Kumar Sharma, Yudhvir Singh, and Yogendra Yadav said.They said that Mission UP would continue in order to expose “the anti-farmer face of the BJP.’“Mission UP will flag the fact that union minister of state for home Ajay Mishra was not sacked despite SIT probe finding the culpability of his son in Lakhimpur Kheri killings. The anti-farmer policies of BJP ruled UP will be exposed and a public appeal will be made to the people to punish the BJP,” the SKM said with BJP and rival SP-RLD combine actively wooing Jats of agriculture dominant western UP which goes to polls in the first two phases starting February 10.SKM further cautioned candidates and parties in Punjab against using their name or credentials for electoral purposes and warned members of stern action should they align politically.SKM also declared support for the nationwide strike call central trade unions have given for February 23 and 24 against the new labour code, MSP, and privatisation.In western UP, Rakesh Tikait, a prominent SKM leader, has been tacitly backing RLD although publicly he has pledged political neutrality.                                      #agriculturelaws                                     #BJP                                     #farmersagigation                                     #SKM                                     #UPPolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/skm-to-mark-january-31-as-betrayal-day-will-ask-uttar-pradesh-to-punish-bjp-365022

South African great Jonty Rhodes and West Indies swashbuckler Chris Gayle had also received similar letters from the PM."Dear, Mr @narendramodi, Thanks for the incredibly kind words in your letter to me.

28-01-2022||New Delhi||India discussing several ideas with Canada to check illegal migration||On the back foot after four undocumented Indians from Gujarat were found frozen to death on the Canada-US border, the government has said a number of ideas remain under discussion with Ottawa to check irregular migration, smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings.The Canadian authorities have confirmed the identities of the four who died while crossing the Canada-US border in a blizzard were Jagdish Patel (39 years), his wife Vaishaliben Patel (37 years), and their two children Vihangi (11 years) and Dharmik (three years).Post-mortems of their bodies showed that they had all died due to “exposure to the outdoor elements”.The MEA admitted that in the longer term this tragedy has brought into focus the need to ensure that migration and mobility are made safe and legal and that such tragedies do not recur. A number of ideas remain under discussion between India and Canada to prevent and suppress irregular migration, smuggling of migrants and trafficking in human beings.To facilitate sustainable and circular mobility India has proposed a comprehensive Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement (MMPA) to Canada, which remains under the consideration of the Canadian government, it said. India has pursued similar agreements with the UK and France but analysts such as Liz Barratt say in the most part they are light on details.“It sets out the broad basis on which the Indian and UK governments intend to build on the ‘long-standing and historical bonds of friendship’ between the two nations to facilitate mutually advantageous mobility of professional skilled workers and students,’’ she observes about the India-UK MMPA.“People-to-people relations are an important pillar of India-Canada bilateral relations. Canada is a preferred destination for Indian immigrants and students. India and Canada work together to ensure the safety and well-being of all Indian immigrants into Canada. The two countries have a regular consular dialogue which takes up issues related to migration and welfare of citizens in each other’s territories,’’ said the High Commission of India in Ottawa.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-discussing-several-ideas-with-canada-to-check-illegal-migration-365014
28-01-2022||New Delhi||HC asks Centre to clarify if it wishes to withdraw stand opposing pleas to criminalise marital rape||The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Centre to inform whether it wishes to withdraw its 2017 affidavit in which it had submitted that marital rape cannot be made a criminal offence as it could become a phenomenon which may destabilise the institution of marriage and an easy tool for harassing husbands.A bench of Justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar, which has been conducting marathon hearings on a batch of petitions seeking criminalisation of marital rape, asked Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma to take instructions on this aspect and listed the matter for January 31.The court’s direction came after advocate Karuna Nundy, representing petitioner NGOs RIT Foundation and All India Democratic Women’s Association, sought a clarification as to whether she shall address on the written submissions and affidavits filed by the central government so far or they are withdrawing it.To this, Justice Shakdher said, “Mr Sharma take instructions on that as well. What do you want? Monday.” This assumes significance as the Centre, in its affidavit filed in August 2017, had said the Supreme Court and various High Courts have already observed the rising misuse of Section 498A (harassment caused to a married woman by her husband and in-laws) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).It had further said that marital rape has not been defined in an statue or law and while the offence of rape is defined under section 375 IPC, defining marital rape would call for a broad based consensus of the society.However, in January, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the high court that it was considering a “constructive approach” to the issue and has sought suggestions from several stakeholders and authorities on comprehensive amendments to the criminal law.He had said criminalisation of marital rape involves “family issues” as well as the dignity of a woman and cannot be looked at from a “microscopic angle” and sought some time to respond with the government’s stand.The bench, on January 24, granted 10 days to the Centre to come back with its stand on the issue.The court, which has been hearing the pleas on a daily basis since January 10, has concluded hearing the submissions of petitioners, Delhi government and some NGOs which have been opposing the pleas.On Friday, Sharma submitted that the petitioners should advance their rejoinder arguments after the Centre places its arguments before the court.However, the bench said that either the central government shall start its submissions from January 31 or it would hear the rejoinder arguments of petitioners.“You are not starting so we will hear them. What to do now? If you do not start, we will hear them. Without you it is not going anywhere. At least we will hear Karuna Nundy and Colin Gonsalves (counsel for petitioners),” the bench said.Sharma responded by saying there was “no unseemly hurry” in the matter and the court has already granted time to the Centre.To this, Justice Shakdher shot back, “Please don’t say that. We have taken out our judicial time on this, so don’t say this and don’t enter on side issues. Let us have a dialogue on more substantial things, which is the law.” “Take a week after they have finished but at least start. You can come back on that,” the bench said.During the hearing, NGO, Men Welfare Trust (MWT), which is opposing the batch of petitions seeking criminalisation of marital rape, submitted that the Domestic Violence Act was specifically promulgated for recognizing spouse sexual violence.Advocate Sai Deepak J, representing the NGO, submitted that the immunity provided is to protect the civil liberties of the husband, thanks to the nature of the relationship.He also clarified that the entity which he represents is not against recognition of spousal sexual violence and claimed that some of the news reports have slightly misconstrued his submissions.On this, the bench said “by the time we finish, we will also face flak.” Nundy also submitted that she has received rape threats but she has not talked about it.MWT’s counsel had earlier argued that sexual intercourse between a husband and wife cannot be treated at par with that in non-marital relationships as the issue of consent cannot be divorced from the context of a marriage.The bench was hearing PILs filed by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association, a man and a woman seeking striking down of the exception granted to husbands under the Indian rape law.Under the exception given in Section 375 of the IPC, sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape.The petitioners had said that marital rape was the biggest form of sexual violence against women and the Delhi government had said that this act was already covered as a “crime of cruelty” under IPC.The petitioner NGO has challenged the Constitutionality of section 375 IPC on the ground that it discriminated against married women being sexually assaulted by their husbands.                                      #DelhiHighCourt                                     #MaritalRape||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-asks-centre-to-clarify-if-it-wishes-to-withdraw-stand-opposing-pleas-to-criminalise-marital-rape-365013

28-01-2022||Satya PrakashNew Delhi||Show statesmanship, not brinkmanship, SC tells lawmakers||Maintaining that Parliament and state legislative assemblies are regarded as sacred places, just like a temple of justice, the Supreme Court on Friday asked lawmakers to show statesmanship, and not brinkmanship.“As a matter of fact, the first place where justice is dispensed to the common man is Parliament/Legislative Assembly albeit by a democratic process,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar said while quashing the suspension of 12 BJP MLAs from Maharashtra Assembly for a year.Supreme Court quashes suspension of 12 BJP MLAs from Maharashtra Assembly“Being House of respected and honourable members, who are emulated by their ardent followers and elected from their respective constituency, they are expected to show statesmanship and not brinkmanship. In the House, their goal is and must be one — so as to ensure the welfare and happiness of ‘we the people of this nation’. In any case, there can be no place for disorderly conduct in the House much less “grossly disorderly,” it said.“It is a place where policies and laws are propounded for governing the citizenry. It is here that the entire range of activities concerning the masses until the last mile, are discussed and their destinies are shaped. That, in itself, is the process of dispensing justice to the citizens of this country,” the Bench noted.Noting that disorderly conduct must be dealt with sternly for ensuring orderly functioning of the House, the top court said, “But, that action must be constitutional, legal, rational and as per the procedure established by law”.It said, “This case has thrown up an occasion for all concerned to ponder over the need to evolve and adhere to good practices befitting the august body; and appropriately denounce and discourage proponents of undemocratic activities in the House, by democratically elected representatives.”Maintaining that legislature was meant for “robust and dispassionate debates and discussion inspired by the highest traditions of truth and righteousness” for resolving the burning issues confronting the nation/State and for dispensing justice—political, social and economic,” it said, “The happenings in the House is reflection of the contemporary societal fabric.”The court said, “It is in public domain (through print, electronic and social media) that the members of the Parliament or Assembly/Council of the State, spend much of the time in a hostile atmosphere. The Parliament and Legislative Assemblies are becoming a more and more intransigent place”.It said: “The philosophical tenet, one must agree to disagree, is becoming seldom seen or a rarity during the debates. It has become common to hear that the House could not complete its usual scheduled business and most of the time had been spent in jeering and personal attacks against each other instead of erudite constructive and educative debates consistent with the highest tradition of the august body. This is the popular sentiment gaining ground amongst the common man.“It is disheartening for the observers. They earnestly feel that it is high time that corrective steps are taken by all concerned and the elected representatives would do enough to restore the glory and the standard of intellectual debates of the highest order, as have been chronicled by their predecessors. That legacy should become more prominent than the rumpus caused very often.”Noting that aggression during the debates has no place in the setting of a country governed by the Rule of Law, the top court said, “Even a complex issue needs to be resolved in a congenial atmosphere by observing collegiality and showing full respect and deference towards each other. They ought to ensure optimum utilisation of quality time of the House, which is very precious, and is the need of the hour especially when we the people of India that is Bharat, take credit of being the oldest civilisation on the planet and also being the world’s largest democracy (demographically).”“For becoming world leaders and self-dependant/reliant, quality of debates in the House ought to be of the highest order and directed towards intrinsic constitutional and native issues confronting the common man of the nation/States, who are at the crossroad of semi-sesquicentennial or may we say platinum or diamond jubilee year on completion of 75 years post-independence,” it said.                                     #BJP                                     #SupremeCourt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/show-statesmanship-not-brinkmanship-sc-tells-lawmakers-365003

Minorities facing trouble in any of our neighboring countries prefer to seek refuge in India because India is safe. Let’s be grateful to our great nation,” Rijiju said in a series of tweets.What Hamid Ansari Ji said is wrong..I belong to a minority community and I can proudly say that India is safest nation.Minorities facing trouble in any of our neighboring countries prefer to seek refuge in India because India is safe.Let's be grateful to our great nation.  Participating in the panel discussion from India, former vice president Ansari had expressed his concern over the rising trend of Hindu nationalism.“In recent years, we have experienced the emergence of trends and practices that dispute the well-established principle of civic nationalism and interpose a new and imaginary practice of cultural nationalism.... It wants to distinguish citizens on the basis of their faith, give vent to intolerance, insinuate otherness, and promote disquiet and insecurity,” he had alleged.Countering Ansari, Rijiju said some isolated incidents do take place at individual-community level “but Indian culture is always inclusive. Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji’s mantra is sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas, sabka prayas”.Before 2014, communal riots and violence were regular but India is more peaceful now, the Union minister said.“Why some people who enjoy the best freedom and privilege in India join the anti-India propaganda peddled by foreign based anti India forces? What’s the satisfaction that they acquire by defaming India? At least, people in remote villages without facilities are loyal to motherland,” Rijiju said in a dig at Ansari.                                     #HamidAnsari                                     #HinduNationalism                                     #KiranRijiju||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-ex-vice-president-hamid-ansari-said-is-wrong-law-minister-kiren-rijiju-on-iamc-event-365002

Both the cities have exceeded the limit of air pollutants allowed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), as reported by the latest report of Greenpeace India.Strangely enough, Hyderabad, despite being landlocked, has hundreds of water bodies and trees to clean up the air. At the same time, Vizag or Vishakhapatnam, as it is also known, is a coastal city on the Bay of Bengal and houses the Eastern Naval Command, one of the three command-level formations of the Indian Navy. But despite all the positives, both Hyderabad and Vizag house lot of industry that is the culprit for unhealthy air here.Greenpeace India has found 2.5 (PM2.5) particulate matter (solid and liquid particles suspended in air) in both these cities, an increase by 7 to 8 times, while the particulate matter 10 (PM10) has gone up 6 to 7 times.The report is based on the finding of the NGO in air quality assessment in 10 big southern cities of Bengaluru, Chennai, Kochi, Mangaluru, Mysuru, Puducherry, Coimbatore and Amaravati. Surprisingly, these cities don’t lag far behind metros like Delhi in impacting good health.The report explains that PM2.5 is a fine particulate matter produced by vehicles, while the dust from construction sites produces PM10. These suspended materials can enter the human lungs during breathing and reach the bloodstream leading to heart and breathing issues.The report wonders how air pollution has increased despite extended lockdowns due to Covid-19.Greenpeace India report talks about the annual average PM2.5 values of the ten south Indian cities. It puts the increase at Coimbatore, Bengaluru, Amaravati, and Mangaluru at 6 to 7 times, and Chennai, Kochi, Mysuru and Puducherry at 4 to 5 times.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/despite-lockdown-hyderabad-and-vizag-air-becomes-worse-364999

28-01-2022||Dehradun||Uttarakhand polls: Harak Singh Rawat not in contest for first time in two decades||With all parties having announced their candidates for the February 14 Uttarakhand election, former cabinet minister Harak Singh Rawat has emerged as the most prominent face to have been left out of the poll fray.It is for the first time in the two-decade old electoral history of Uttarakhand that Rawat—the veteran of many a poll battle is not contesting.The Kotdwar MLA, who was recently expelled from the BJP for allegedly insisting on a ticket for both himself and his daughter-in-law, had rejoined the Congress on January 22. Despite returning to the Congress fold, he could not get a ticket for himself while his reinduction too was not smooth.However, the four-time MLA’s daughter-in-law and former Femina Miss India contestant Anukriti Gusain did get a Congress ticket from Lansdowne.Harak Singh Rawat has been saying that he is not keen to contest, but would do so if asked by the party.There was speculation about the Congress fielding him from Chaubattakhal constituency against BJP heavyweight and sitting MLA from the seat Satpal Maharaj but things appear to have not fallen into place eventually.Harak Singh Rawat was a candidate in all the four elections held in the state since its creation in November 2000 and emerged victorious in all of them. He won from Lansdowne in 2002 and 2007. He won from Rudraprayag in 2012 and from Kotdwar in 2017.Meanwhile, Harak Singh Rawat is likely to throw all his might and political clout into the battle to ensure the victory of his daughter-in-law from Lansdowne.Another prominent leader missing from the poll fray this time is former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat who opted out saying he did not want to contest so he could focus on working for the BJP’s second consecutive victory in the polls.Made chief minister after the party got a huge mandate of 57 out of a total of 70 seats in the state in 2017, Trivendra Singh Rawat was removed rather unceremoniously in March last year just a few days ahead of completing four years in office.                                      #HarakSinghRawat                                     #LansdowneConstituency                                     #Uttarakhandpolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-polls-harak-singh-rawat-not-in-contest-for-first-time-in-two-decades-364991

On Independence Day last year, he chose a saffron headgear with red patterns and a long plume.For his maiden Independence Day speech in 2014, he had opted for a bright red Jodhpuri bandhej turban with green at the tail.In 2015, he chose a yellow turban covered with multi-coloured crisscross lines, and a tie and dye turban in hues of pink and yellow in 2016.The prime minister’s turban for 2017 was a mix of bright red and yellow with crisscrossed golden lines all over.

This trial has been permitted to be conducted at 9 sites.In August, the nasal vaccine had received the regulator's nod for conducting phase 2 clinical trials.BBV154 is an intranasal replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus SARS-CoV-2 vectored vaccine."BBV154 (nasal covid vaccine) has received approval for phase-3 clinical trials. The trials will evaluate BBV154 nasal vaccine for both the two-dose primary schedule and booster dose schedule," a source in Bharat Biotech said.An intra-nasal vaccine would not only be simple to administer but also reduce the use of needles and syringes, among others. It would also impact the overall cost of a vaccination drive, chairman of Bharat Biotech Krishna Ella had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dcgi-allows-bharat-biotech-to-conduct-phase-3-trials-for-covids-intranasal-booster-dose-364983

Besides Deshmukh, it had named named his two sons as accused in the case.Prior to that, the probe agency had filed a charge sheet against 14 accused, including Deshmukh’s private secretary (an additional collector-rank officer) Sanjeev Palande and personal assistant Kundan Shinde.Deshmukh was arrested by the ED on November 1 last year in connection with the case and is currently in judicial custody.The ED had launched a probe against Deshmukh and his associates after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed an FIR against the NCP leader on April 21 last year on charges of corruption and misuse of official position.The ED’s case is that while serving as state home minister, Deshmukh allegedly misused his official position and through Sachin Waze, a police officer who has been dismissed from service after his arrest in the ‘Antilia’ bomb scare and Mansukh Hiran killing cases, collected Rs 4.70 crore from various bars in Mumbai.The money was laundered to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, an educational trust controlled by the Deshmukh family.

Now it’s planned to be released on OTT platform, ‘Limelight’ on January 30 – the day Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse.NCP leader and an MP from Shirur Lok Sabha constituency Amol Kolhe has played the role of Godse in the film. He recently clarified that he was a firm believer in Gandhian thoughts and he took up the controversial role only to challenge himself as an actor.Petitioner Sikarndar Behl alleged that the film glorified Nathuram Godse and celebrated his act of killing Mahatma Gandhi. The movie intended to tarnish the image of the Father of the Nation and was aimed at creating communal disharmony, spreading hatred and disturbing peace, he alleged.Behl wanted the top court to issue directions for regulation of OTT platforms which were beyond the jurisdiction of the censor board as a result of which uncensored content was being broadcast.                                     #AmolKolhe                                     #OTT                                     #SikarndarBehl||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-sc-against-why-i-killed-gandhi-on-ott-platform-364968

After the company court admitted the winding up petition, SpiceJet moved the Madras High Court which refused to entertain its appeal, forcing the airline to approach the top court.During the hearing, the Bench said, “If you (SpiceJet) don’t want to run the airlines, we will declare you insolvent. This is not the way to run an airline.”“We will come to something, we have something in mind. Please stay the high court’s order,” Salve replied.Following this, the Bench adjourned the matter for three weeks and also stayed the Madras High Court order.                                     #CreditSuisse                                     #MadrasHighCourt                                     #SpiceJet||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sc-stays-madras-hc-order-admitting-winding-up-petition-against-spicejet-by-company-court-364965

28-01-2022||Bhopal||TV actor Shweta Tiwari booked for 'hurting religious sentiments'||Police here on Friday registered a case against television actor Shweta Tiwari for allegedly hurting religious sentiments through her remark on god, an official said.The case was registered against Tiwari in the wake of Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra's directions to the city police to investigate her remark and submit a report.Tiwari had made the controversial statement in Bhopal on Wednesday during the promotion of her web series ‘Show Stopper’. A video of Tiwari's statement has gone viral on social media, in which she purportedly referred to god while speaking about her innerwear. Her co-actors were also present when she made the remark during an interaction with mediapersons."A case was registered against Shweta Tiwari early on Friday under IPC section 295 (A) (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs)," the official of Shyamla Hills police station said. The case was filed based on the complaint lodged by Sonu Prajapati, a local, who alleged that the actor had hurt his religious sentiments through her comment."We will summon Tiwari to the police station either by sending her a notice by post or by sending a police team to her place to serve notice," he said.The offence is non-bailable, but as it attracts imprisonment of less than seven years, no arrest can be made as per the Supreme Court's directive issued earlier, he added.When contacted, Assistant Commissioner of Police (Kotwali) Bittu Sharma told PTI that the actor would be formally arrested, but she could get bail from the police station itself after which she had to get it rectified by a competent court.                                     #case                                     #MP                                     #religiousentiments                                     #ShwetaTiwari||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tv-actor-shweta-tiwari-booked-for-hurting-religious-sentiments-364954
28-01-2022||Satya PrakashNew Delhi||Treat cadre as unit for collecting quantifiable data to determine inadequacy of SC/ST representation, says SC||The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that cadre has to be the unit for collecting quantifiable data to determine inadequacy of representation of members of Schedule Castes and Scheduled Tribes for extending the benefit of reservation in promotions to them in government jobs.Maintaining that it was meaningless to collect data on the entire service, a three-judge Bench led by Justice NL Rao said the states were obligated to collect quantifiable data regarding adequacy of representation of SCs/STs in public employment.The Bench – which also included Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice BR Gavai – however, said courts cannot lay down any yardstick to determine inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in government services.“Collection of quantifiable data for determining the inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs is a basic requirement for providing reservation in promotions,” the top said, reiterating its verdict in M Nagraj case.“For the purpose of collection of quantifiable data for providing reservation in promotions, the entire service cannot be taken to be a unit and treated as a cadre,…” it added.“The State should justify reservation in promotions with respect to the cadre to which promotion is made. Taking into account the data pertaining to a ‘group’, which would be an amalgamation of certain cadres in a service, would not give the correct picture of the inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in the cadre in relation to which reservation in promotions is sought to be made,” the Bench said.The top court – which had reserved its verdict on the issue October 26 last year—said a review has to be conducted regarding data for the purpose of determining inadequacy of representation for providing reservation in promotion. The period of review should be reasonable, it noted.The verdict can potentially lead to another round of litigation on the contentious issue as the Bench left it to the government to lay down the yardstick to determine inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in government services and the period of review.The top court fixed February 24 to take up individual petitions, including contempt petitions against senior government officials, which will be decided on the basis of the constitutional principles laid down by it on Friday.It declared that the conclusions in BK Pavitra (II) case decided in 2019 approving the collection of data on the basis of groups and not cadres was contrary to the verdict in Jarnail Singh’s case (2018).The verdict came on a batch of petitions on the issue of reservation in promotions to the employees belonging to SC and ST given by the Central Government, various PSUs and state governments in public employment.While upholding validity of the 77th, 81st, 82nd and 85th Amendments on various aspects of reservation in promotions, the SC had in M Nagraj case in 2006 stipulated that in each case State will have to show the existence of “compelling reasons”, including “inadequacy of representation” and overall “administrative efficiency” before providing reservation in promotions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-refuses-to-lay-down-yardstick-for-granting-reservation-in-promotion-to-scs-sts-364951

Thus, the impugned resolution is unreasonable, irrational, and arbitrary and liable to be set aside.”Allowing the petitions of BJP MLAs, the Bench said, “…the petitioners are entitled for all consequential benefits of being members of the Legislative Assembly, on and after the expiry of the period of the remainder of the concerned Session in July 2021.”It declared that the impugned resolution directing suspension of the BJP MLAs beyond the period of the remainder of the concerned Monsoon Session held in July 2021 “is non est in the eyes  of  law, nullity,  unconstitutional, substantively illegal and irrational. The impugned resolution is, thus, declared to be ineffective in law, insofar as the period beyond the remainder of the  stated Session in which the resolution came to  be passed.”Twelve BJP MLAs were suspended from the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly for a year after the State Government accused them of misbehaving with Presiding Officer Bhaskar Jadhav in the Speaker's chamber on the first day of the monsoon session on July 5, 2021.The suspended BJP MLAs are Dr. Sanjay Kute, Ashish Shelar, Abhimanyu Pawar, Girish Mahajan, Atul Bhatkhalkar, Harish Pimple, Jaikumar Rawal, Yogesh Sagar, Narayan Kuche, Bunty Bhangdiya, Parag Alvani and Ram Satpute.The top court said, “It would also impact the   democratic   setup   as   a   whole   by   permitting   the   thin majority   Government   (coalition   Government)   of   the   day   to manipulate the numbers of the Opposition Party in the House in an undemocratic manner.  “Not only that, the Opposition will   not   be   able   to   effectively   participate   in   the discussion/debate in the House owing to the constant fear of its members being suspended for a longer period.  There would be no purposeful or meaningful debates but one in terrorem and as per the whims of the majority. That would not be healthy for democracy as a whole,” it added.Maintaining that “suspension is essentially a disciplinary measure”, the top court said, “It must follow that suspension for a period of one year would assume the character of punitive and punishment worse than expulsion.  For, suspension for a long period and beyond the Session has the effect of creating a de facto  vacancy though not a de jure vacancy.”                                     #BJP                                     #Maharashtra                                     #MLAs                                     #SC                                     #suspension||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-quashes-suspension-of-12-bjp-mlas-from-maharashtra-assembly-364950

India has asserted that its decisions are based on its national interest to protect its national security.“Well in many ways, this doesn't change the concerns that we have with the S-400 system. I think it shines a spotlight on the destabilising role that Russia is playing not only in the region but potentially beyond as well,” State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters on Thursday at his daily news conference.“When it comes to CAATSA sanctions, you've heard me say before, we haven't made a determination with regard to this transaction, but it's something we continue to discuss with the government of India given the risk of sanctions for this particular transaction under CAATSA,” he said.Price was responding to a question on implications of the Russian S-400 system to India on its bilateral ties with New Delhi given the unprecedented tension it is having with Moscow on what it calls an imminent Ukrainian invasion.Despite strong objections from the US and threat of sanctions from the Biden Administration, India has refused to make any changes in its decision and is going ahead with the purchase of the missile defence system.“Whether it is India, whether it is any other country, we continue to urge all countries to avoid major new transactions for Russian weapon systems,” Price said.The Biden Administration, so far, has not taken any decision on CAATSA sanctions. “I don't have a timeline to offer, but these are issues that we continue to discuss with our partners in India,” Price said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russia-playing-a-destabilising-role-in-region-us-says-on-its-selling-s-400-defence-system-to-india-364942

Karan Singh, former ministers Ashwani Kumar, Anand Sharma, Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor and Kapil Sibal and former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda hailed the award to Azad.Karan Singh said, “If one of our colleagues is honored he should be greeted with appreciation rather than snide remarks.” He said he had known Azad for 50 years since Azad started hispolitical career as an active participant in his second election campaign for the Lok Sabha in 1971 from the Udhampur constituency, to which he belonged.“These awards should be recognised for what they are and should not be viewed from the perspective of which party is conferring the award on whom,” Ashwani Kumar said, even as Kapil Sibal said it was ironic that the Congress did not need Azad’s services when the nation recognised his contributions to public life.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/distressed-says-jk-ex-guv-on-award-row-364773

Market authorisation means that private hospitals can now directly procure the shots from the manufacturers. The vaccines will, however, not be sold off the shelf and will continue to be administered at registered vaccination centres through the CoWIN platform.The conditions of the approval say the firms will have to submit data of overseas ongoing clinical trials with due analysis once every six months instead of once every 15 days. The vaccine will be supplied for programmatic setting and all vaccinations done in India will be recorded on CoWIN platform. Adverse event post-immunisation and adverse event of special interest will continue to be monitored with safety data to be submitted once in six months (instead of 15 days).Bharat Biotech-made Covaxin, and Serum Institute of India’s Covishield are the first Covid shots to get conditional regular approval in India. So far these were allowed for emergency use.On January 19, the Subject Expert Committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) on Covid-19 had recommended regular market approval to Covishield and Covaxin subject to certain conditions.The emergency use authorisation (EUA) is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, during public health emergencies such as the current Covid-19 pandemic. The Health Ministry today said the approval indicates the promptness and timeliness with which the public response strategy and decision-making apparatus of the country has responded to the emerging needs during the pandemic. Of all regulatory authorities worldwide, only the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the UK have so far granted “conditional market authorisation” to Pfizer and AstraZeneca Covid vaccines, respectively.The “conditional market authorization” is a new category of market authorisation that has emerged during the current pandemic.Under this, approval pathways are fast-tracked conditionally to enhance access to certain pharmaceuticals for meeting the emerging needs of drugs or vaccines.Today’s approvals will allay the fears of skeptics who are vaccine-hesitant due to emergency approval of the shots. The conditional market authorisation also means the vaccine safety has been firmly established.A government analysis of the Omicron-induced third wave has shown significant lower mortality this year as compared to the second wave in 2021 on account of over 74 per cent adults fully covered with both doses in 2022 as against just 2 per cent in May 2021.                                     #Covaxin                                     #Covishield||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covaxin-covishield-get-conditional-market-nod-for-inoculating-adults-364754

The summit, hosted by PM Narendra Modi, was attended by presidents of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyz Republic.Summit’s motives1 Strong ties essential for regional security2 Framework must for regular interactions3 Roadmap for unity via integrated approachAgreement on biennial meetingsThis was to be an in-person interaction, but rising Covid cases led to the cancellation of the presidents’ Delhi visit to attend the Republic Day parade as chief guests.PM Modi sought to set an ambitious agenda by suggesting a roadmap for the next 30 years on connectivity and cooperation in an integrated manner, said MEA’s Secretary (West) Reenat Sandhu.The joint declaration issued after the summit also identified health as another area of cooperation with the presidents keen on leading Indian hospital chains seeking to expand their footprint.An important outcome of the meeting was the agreement to hold the summit once every two years. One of the key proposals by the Prime Minister was to institutionalise the framework for India-Central Asia cooperation at the regional level through line-level ministerial meetings to strengthen cooperation in political and developmental partnership, trade and connectivity, culture and tourism, and security, said Sandhu.PM Modi suggested that an India-Central Asia centre to serve as a secretariat could be set up here. He said the interaction had three main objectives.First, to make it clear that cooperation between India and Central Asia was essential for regional security. The second was to establish a framework of regular interactions and the third was to create a roadmap for cooperation through an integrated approach.                                     #NarendraModi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-central-asia-meet-pm-talks-of-30-yr-plan-on-trade-connectivity-364756

Miram Taron was handed over to the Indian Army at the Wacha-Damai border meeting point in Anjaw district of far-eastern Arunachal.Indian authorities are “de-briefing” the youth to ascertain if he had lost his way in the thickly forested areas along the LAC or had he been abducted by the PLA.

Today’s decision has rekindled a hope in the community that all guilty will be punishment,” Sirsa said. He has urged the HC to direct the SIT to take action against Kamal Nath in an FIR lodged in 1984 at Parliament Street police station in which five persons were named and were allegedly accommodated at the Congress leader’s house.The case is related to a mob of rioters storming the Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib here. The five accused were discharged for want of evidence.

Members of the two communities participated in the yearlong agitation against the now-repealed farm laws.Jolt for Congress, former Goa CM opts outNew Delhi: In a massive pre-election jolt to the Congress in Goa, former six-time Chief Minister Pratapsinh Rane on Thursday decided to withdraw from the race for the Poriem constituency he has represented since 1972. The decision came after the ruling BJP nominated Rane’s daughter-in-law Deviya Vishwajeet Rane from the seat. TNSParrikar’s son to go IndependentPanaji: Former Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar’s son Utpal (in picture below) has filed his nomination as an independent candidate. Utpal had resigned from the BJP after he was denied ticket by the ruling party, which opted for sitting BJP MLA Atanasio Monserrate instead. IANSHome Minister Amit Shah, who was in the region today for yet another outreach, had yesterday held a meeting with leaders of the Jat community at the residence of Delhi MP Pravesh Verma. Interestingly, apart from slamming main rival Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav for corruption and law and order, Shah also termed him an “outsider” while going all out to woo his ally, RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary.Breathing fire against the SP and the Mayawati-led BSP, his “soft” approach towards Jayant was unmissable, even today in Mathura, leading to widespread speculations.While addressing Jat leaders assembled at Verma's residence yesterday, Shah said, “Why do you bring outsiders in a fight within the house?" He also said “Jayant has chosen the wrong house this time”, while pointing that “ideology of both the BJP and the Jats is the same as both keep national interest first and have been fight against invaders”. Though Chaudhary has rejected the offer terming it an “election tactic”, rivals are sensing red, calling it an “underhand attempt to confuse the voters”.                                     #AkhileshYadav                                     #AmitShah                                     #UPPolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shah-woos-western-up-jats-gujjars-calls-akhilesh-outsider-364769
