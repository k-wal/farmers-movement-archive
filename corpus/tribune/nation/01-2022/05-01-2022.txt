05-01-2022||---||An SC/ST in one state can't claim benefits admissible to such community in another state: SC||New Delhi, January 5A person belonging to a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in one state can’t claim the benefits admissible to persons belonging to such a community in another state, the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday.The top court endorsed the view that social condition of a community varied from state to state and it will not be proper to generalise any caste or any tribe as a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe for the whole country.A Bench led by Justices MR Shah said the appellant in the case before it being a Schedule Caste person from Punjab and a permanent resident of Punjab, he could not claim the benefits admissible to an SC person in Rajasthan for purchase of land belonging to an SC person.The Bench relied upon a 1994 Constitution Bench judgment in the Action Committee on Issue of Caste Certificate to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the State of Maharashtra and Another Vs. Union of India to decide the dispute was with respect to a piece of land in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan.“Appellant – original defendant being a Scheduled Caste belonging to State of Punjab and being an ordinarily and permanent resident of the State of Punjab cannot claim the benefit of a Scheduled Caste in the State of Rajasthan for the purpose of purchase of the land belonging to a Scheduled Caste person of State of Rajasthan, which was given to original allottee as Scheduled Caste landless person, and therefore, as rightly held by the Division Bench of the High Court, the sale transaction in favour of the appellant – original defendant was in clear breach and/or in violation of Section 42 of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955,” the top court held.The piece of land under dispute was allotted to the father of the respondent in 1972 as Scheduled Caste landless person. A lender belonging to Jat caste duped him by making him sign a sale deed in favour of Bhadar Ram (appellant) an SC from Punjab.The Rajasthan High Court held that Bhadar Ram being a SC person from Punjab could not have taken the benefits admissible to an SC person in Rajasthan.On an appeal filed by Bhadar Ram, the top court ruled that the land transaction was in breach of Section 42 of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/an-sc-st-in-one-state-cant-claim-benefits-admissible-to-such-community-in-another-state-sc-358463

The UK does not include this drug nor does the WHO,” ICMR Director-General Balram Bhargava said, adding that the drug poses major safety challenges.He said the US has approved it based on results in 1,433 patients, with only 3 per cent reduction in moderate disease.“However, this drug has major safety concerns. It can cause teratogenicity, mutagenicity, cartilage damage and muscle damage. Couples must use contraception for three months if this drug has been administered to a pregnant woman because it can harm the child. This drug is not included in the Indian Covid treatment protocols. We are concerned about its impact on pregnancy, lactation, and soft tissue. So, it is not part of the national taskforce treatment guidelines,” Bhargava said.The Indian experts have twice debated the use of the antiviral in Covid patients but decided against it. The discussions are ongoing.Around 13 Indian companies, including Cipla and Dr Reddy’s Labs, are manufacturing Molnupiravir developed by US-based Ridgeback Biotherapeutics in partnership with Merck.While teratogenicity refers to a drug’s ability to harm the fetus and disturb its formation, mutagenicity is permanent damage to genetic materials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/molnupuravir-first-anti-covid-pill-has-major-safety-concerns-icmr-after-dcgi-approval-358461

Punjab received 2 mm rain against the normal of 1.8 mm, while Haryana recorded 0.5 mm against the normal of 1.8 mm.As far as precipitation during the past 24 hours is concerned, IMD data showed that there has been a massive surplus in the aforementioned three states. Rain has been above normal by 650 percent in Himachal, 283 percent in Punjab and 73 percent in Haryana, IMD data showed.According to IMD, the minimum temperatures remained above normal by 2 to 5 degree Celsius over most parts of north India during the past 24 hours. The weatherman does not expect any significant change in minimum temperatures during the next 4-5 days and nor is there any prediction of a cold wave over north India in this period.The wet spell over northwest India is expected to continue till January 9 due to two consecutive active western disturbances. A western disturbance lies over Afghanistan and its neighbourhood while an induced cyclonic circulation lies over southwest Rajasthan and adjoining Pakistan, with moisture feeding from Arabian Sea over northwest India. This will result in widespread light to moderate rain or snow continuing over many parts of north India on January 5.Thereafter, an intense western disturbance is very likely to affect northwest India from the night of January 6 onwards, leading to widespread rain or snow over the western Himalayan region as well as plains of Punjab and Haryana during January 7-9, the IMD has predicted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/north-india-gets-surplus-rain-but-temperature-remains-above-normal-358460
05-01-2022||New Delhi||Security lapse: Congress tried to physically harm PM Modi, alleges BJP||The BJP on Wednesday launched an all-out attack on the Congress over the breach in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s security in Punjab, alleging it wanted to physically harm him as repeated defeats in elections have taken the party on the path of “insanity”.Top BJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah and party president J P Nadda, lashed out at the Congress, which is in power in the state, over the incident.Nadda accused the Congress of trying “all possible tricks to scuttle” Modi’s programmes, including a rally, in the state. Union Minister Smriti Irani asked whether the Congress leaders were “happy that the prime minister was on the verge of death”.Hitting out at the state government after Modi’s rally was called off and another programme disrupted as protesters blocked his route breaching the security protocol, Nadda said what is extremely worrisome is that the incident was also a big security lapse.In his tweets, Shah said, what was witnessed in the state is “Congress-made” and a trailer of how this party thinks and functions.“Repeated rejections by the people have taken them on the path of insanity. The topmost echelons of the Congress owe an apology to the people of India for what they have done,” he said.Noting that his ministry has sought a detailed report on the security breach in Punjab, Shah said such dereliction of security procedure in the prime minister’s visit is totally unacceptable and that accountability will be fixed.Modi’s Punjab visit was cut short as he was stranded on a flyover for 20 minutes due to a blockade by protesters.According to a Home Ministry statement, after the serious lapse in security, Modi’s convoy decided to return without attending an event at a martyrs’ memorial at Hussainiwala. The prime minister also could not attend a rally in Ferozepur.Addressing a press conference in Delhi, Union Minister Smriti Irani blasted the Congress alleging planted political instruments were given political patronage by the party’s government in Punjab to breach Modi’s security.“Never before in the history of our country has a state government knowingly constructed a scenario where the prime minister of the country will be brought in harm’s way,” she said.“The Congress failed in its murderous intentions on the holy land of Punjab... Congress leaders were expressing joy over the prime minister’s security breach. Were they happy that Prime Minister Modi was on the verge of death?” Irani posed.Hitting out at the Punjab government, she alleged police functionaries in a state were “directed to breach the security of the Prime Minister of India and cause him physical harm”.In a series of tweets, Nadda sought to put the state government in a dock over its alleged lapses.“Protestors were given access to the Prime Minister’s route while the Punjab CS (chief secretary) and DGP gave assurances to SPG that the route is clear. To make matters worse, Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi refused to get on the phone to either address the matter or solve it. The tactics used by the Congress government in Punjab would pain anyone who believes in democratic principles,” he said.Nadda alleged that the state police was instructed to prevent people from attending Modi’s rally and a large number of buses were stranded because of the high-handedness of the police in connivance with the protesters.In doing so, they did not bother that the prime minister was to pay tributes to Bhagat Singh and other freedom fighters, and lay the foundation stone for key development works, the BJP president said.“By their cheap antics, Congress government in Punjab has shown that they are anti-development and have no respect for freedom fighters too,” he said, alleging it was done as the ruling party in the state fears a resounding defeat in the upcoming Assembly polls.“It is sad that the prime minister’s visit to launch development projects worth thousands of crores for Punjab was disrupted. But we will not let such cheap mentality hinder the progress of Punjab and will continue the effort for the development of Punjab,” Nadda said.Chief Minister Channi on Wednesday expressed regret after Prime Minister Narendra Modi had to cut short his visit to the state, but asserted that there was no security lapse.Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said Nadda should stop indulging in blame game and the BJP should instead introspect its “anti-farmer” attitude. He alleged that lack of crowd at Modi’s rally was a factor being the prime minister calling off his trip.BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh, who is from Punjab, said what happened in the state was a matter of shame for the Channi government.He alleged that Channi and Punjab Congress president Navjot Sidhu had joined hands with subversive and anti-national forces to foil the democratic right of the prime minister and the BJP to address public meetings.Lashing out at the Congress, BJP general secretary (organisation) B L Santhosh said, “Politicisation of administration and police reaches new low under Congress in Punjab today. After the Emergency in 1975, it has committed the second grave mistake today. Hon’ble PM’s security was compromised. Congress and the leadership will pay for this heavily in days to come.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/security-lapse-congress-tried-to-physically-harm-pm-modi-alleges-bjp-358457
05-01-2022||---||Centre defends before Supreme Court Rakesh Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police chief||New Delhi, January 5The Centre has defended before the Supreme Court the appointment of Gujarat cadre IPS Rakesh Asthana as the Police Commissioner of Delhi, saying the challenge to his appointment was due to personal vendetta.A 1984-batch IPS officer from the Gujarat cadre, Asthana was the Director-General of the Border Security Force (BSF) before being appointed as Delhi Police Commissioner. Four days before his superannuation on July 31, 2021, the Appointments Committee of Cabinet appointed him as Delhi Police commissioner.His appointment as Delhi Police Commissioner has been challenged by an NGO—Centre for Public Interest Litigation—mainly on the ground that it went against the top court’s ruling on such appointments in Prakash Singh’s case (2006) on police reforms.The Delhi High Court had on October 12 last year dismissed a challenge to Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police Commissioner, saying there was no irregularity, illegality, or infirmity in his appointment. Thereafter, the NGO moved the top court.A Bench of Justice DY Chandrachu – which had on November 26 issued notices to the Centre and Asthana on the NGO’s petition – posted the matter for final hearing. It could not hear it on Wednesday as it was busy with the issue of EWS quota in NEET for admission to PG medical courses.In an affidavit filed in response to the PIL, the Centre said, “Considering the complexities and the sensitivities involved and also considering that no officer of appropriate seniority with balanced experience was available in the AGMUT Cadre, it was felt that an officer belonging to a large state cadre, who had the exposure of complexities of governance and who had the knowledge of nuances of broad canvas policing is given charge of Commissioner of Police Delhi,”It said there was a “compelling need” to have someone like Asthana to head the police force of Delhi, in view of the national capital’s “extremely challenging situations” of public order, policing issues, and their implications on national security.Asthana was chosen “to provide effective policing on the recent law and order situation” which arose in Delhi and that he was given inter-cadre deputation and extension of service “in public interest”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-defends-before-supreme-court-rakesh-asthanas-appointment-as-delhi-police-chief-358453

New cases have also risen sharply from 30,000 on December 31 to over 58000 today with active cases crossing 2 lakh and India adding 1.38 lakh active cases in just nine days since December 27 when the load was 75841.Paul said the country was facing an exponential rise in Covid cases driven by Omicron particularly so in larger cities.He also said that health workers, frontline workers and 60 plus people with comorbid conditions will get as a booster the same vaccine of which they have received the first two doses.On child vaccinations he said as of today over 1 crore adolescents had received their first dose and the plan is to cover all 7.4 crore eligible 15 to 18 year olds in India.“The precautionary vaccine dose to be given to HCWs, FLWs and 60 plus people from January 10 will be the same vaccine as given before. It will be homologous . Those who have received Covaxin will receive Covaxin. Those who have received Covishield will receive Covishield. We are still studying the mixing and heterologous approach as science evolves,” said Paul.He however said the hospitalization rate currently was lower as compared to Delta which saw 20 pc.At present the hospital rate in Delhi is 3.7 pc and in Mumbai 5 pc.“Evidence shows that the current surge is falling as steeply as it is rising especially in Denmark, UK and South Africa but we cannot extrapolate the trends. We have to be alert, be disciplined and be prepared but we should not panic,” said Paul adding that when cases surge beyond a limit, health systems and homes could get overwhelmed.The government stressed on masking, distancing and Covid protocols and called for a people’s movement to address mild Covid at home.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-expanding-exponentially-r0-2-69-much-higher%C2%A0than-1-69-at-2nd-wave-peak-358441

We will announce today fast, decisive and precise measures to cut the transmission chains,” Lam told reporters at a press conference.The two-week ban on passenger flights will be effective until January 21.Travellers who were recently in those countries or had transited through them will be barred from returning to the city for two weeks.She said the measures were vital for preventing imported cases – especially infections carrying the highly transmissible Omicron variant – from spreading further in the community and to prevent public hospitals from being overloaded with Covid-19 patients.Lam said she hoped affected businesses would understand the “decisive, swift and sharp” action taken to curtail the virus.“We will take bold and stringent measures so that within a very short period of time we can contain the Omicron variant,” she said.Leading microbiologist Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, declaring that a fifth Covid-19 wave was “technically” underway, said a number of untraced cases were appearing in the community with health officials still scrambling to pin down their origin.Fellow government adviser Professor Gabriel Leung, dean of the University of Hong Kong’s faculty of medicine, estimated that it would take at least three to six months to fully control the epidemic if there was a community outbreak.“If so, the plan to open the border will once again fail,” he said, amid a pending scheme to resume quarantine-free travel with mainland China.On Wednesday, Hong Kong reported 38 Covid-19 cases, pushing the official tally to 12,799, with 213 related deaths, the Post report said.India on Wednesday saw a single-day rise of 58,097 new coronavirus infections, the highest in around 199 days, taking the total tally of cases to 3,50,18,358. The active cases were recorded above 2 lakh after around 81 days, according to the Health Ministry.The country’s death toll has climbed to 4,82,551 with 534 daily fatalities, the data stated.A total of 2,135 cases of Omicron variant of coronavirus have been detected, out of which, 828 have recovered or migrated, the ministry added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/hong-kong-bans-flights-from-india-7-other-countries-until-january-21-due-to-omicron-358429

These actions continue to fuel a hostile environment for religious communities,” said USCIRF Chair Nadine Maenza while reposting an article that said India’s move to block the flow of foreign funds to Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity (MC) comes amid a pushback by right-wing Hindu nationalists who accuse Christian missionaries of converting Hindus against their will or by offering bribes.It said MC is among the most prominent of thousands of nonprofits, religious charities and rights groups facing a funding ban as part of tighter scrutiny of these groups under the FCRA.The effective freeze on the charity’s foreign donations is being seen by critics as part of the targeting of religious minorities. “If you want to create an impact, you pick icons. When you target visible and revered icons, its shock value is far greater and there is nothing in India more prominent, more trusted and respected than the Missionaries of Charity,” said Valson Thampu, former principal of St. Stephen’s College.The Home Ministry has said it was not renewing MC’s licence to receive foreign funds because of“adverse inputs”’ but provided no further explanation. The development comes after the MC-run children's home in Gujarat was accused of allegedly attempting to convert young girls to Christianity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/such-actions-fuel-hostile-environment-for-religious-communities-uscirf-chief-358416

Though there are unconfirmed reports of a female Cheetah being spotted around 1951.The other new habitats of the Cheetah in India include the Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary, the Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary-Bhainsrorgarh Wildlife Sanctuary complex, the Shahgarh bridge in Jaisalmer and the Mukundara Hills Tiger Reserve. Meanwhile, the government is also working on a futuristic and multi-pronged strategy for the next decade of tiger conservation, officials said.  Addressing a meeting of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), Yadav said Tiger continues to be an endangered species and the situation calls for adopting active management.  “As part of effective regulation of tourism activity, the Tiger Reserves must have one core area which is sacrosanct,” he said. Tiger Reserves are also crucial from the water security point of view because more than 35 rivers originate from these areas, Yadav also saidCurrently, there are 51 Tiger reserves in the country and efforts are being made to bring more areas under the network.  Of these 14 are accredited under CA|TS and the NTCA is working on getting other reserves evaluated for accreditation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-will-soon-have-the-charismatic-cheetah-back-bhupender-yadav-358406

Thank you all for respecting my privacy and for your kind comments,” Bhargava wrote.His resignation comes after the Department of Telecommunications under the Ministry of Communications in December warned Starlink to get necessary permission required to offer satellite-based Internet services in India.The Elon Musk-owned company on Tuesday informed some individuals in the country that it will refund their pre-orders.“I have stepped down as country director and chairman of the board of Starlink India for personal reasons. My last working day was December 31, 2021,” said Bhargava.The Indian government had told Starlink, the satellite internet division of billionaire Musk’s rocket company SpaceX, to stop “booking/rendering the satellite internet service” in the country sans a licence.Starlink later announced that it will apply for a commercial licence in India by January 31.Bhargava said: “I have no time for endless meetings where the statutes, rules, procedures, and internal regulations are discussed, knowing that nothing will be done. I no longer have the patience to stand absurd people who, despite their chronological age, have not grown up”.“My time is too short: I want the essence. My spirit is in a hurry. I do not have much candy in the package anymore”.Earlier, Starlink had announced that it will focus on 10 rural Lok Sabha constituencies to provide the Internet services.“I am also keen to have 30-minute virtual conversations with MPs, ministers, secretaries to the Union government, or principal secretaries to states to see if they think 100 per cent broadband would help improve lives,” Bhargava had said.Starlink shipped 100,000 terminals to customers recently. The project aims to provide global broadband connectivity via a constellation of satellites.SpaceX began satellite launches in November 2019 and opened its $99 per month beta programme for select customers around a year later.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/elon-musks-starlink-india-head-quits-wants-to-live-next-to-people-who-take-responsibility-for-their-actions-358362

If positive, they will be asked to take routine RT-PCR and ask to wait for results,” Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, BMC, tweeted.Presently, 13 countries are listed in the ‘at risk’ category. Passengers arriving from the UAE will also have to undergo rapid RT-PCR tests on arrival as per rules.On Tuesday, Mumbai reported 10,860 new COVID-19 cases, the highest daily count after April 7, 2021, while two more patients succumbed to the infection, as per the civic body.The passengers found positive for coronavirus in the rapid RT-PCR test will have to undergo a regular RT-PCR test at the Mumbai international airport itself, as per the revised order of the BMC.“If the routine RT-PCR test is positive, then the sample will be sent immediately for genome sequencing and the passenger will be sent to institutional quarantine,” the order said.Passengers who test negative will be allowed to leave the airport, but they will need to observe mandatory home quarantine for seven days.“If this sample (routine RT-PCR) test is negative, then the concerned passenger will be allowed to go home for mandatory home quarantine for a total period of seven days,” as per the revised guidelines.All symptomatic passengers testing positive at the airport will be admitted to Seven Hills Hospital, while asymptomatic passengers will be admitted to the jumbo COVID-19 facilities in the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) or Kanjurmarg.If any symptomatic passenger prefers a private hospital, he/she will be shifted to the Bombay Hospital or Breach Candy Hospital, while the asymptomatic patients with similar preferences will be transferred to linked hotels on their expenditure, the guidelines said.

In one lease pertaining to modernising 61 British-era tanks, Indian Oil Corporation will hold a minority stake of 49 per cent with the rest for Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), which will also operate the remaining tanks.India has coveted the Trincomalee farm tanks as it was averse to a foreign company operating them in the vicinity of its shoreline. Talks were being held intermittently since 1987 but the big breakthrough came when Sri Lanka landed in an economic crisis this year. India wasted little time and dispatched Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla in October, who pointedly toured the tank farms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sri-lanka-clears-trincomalee-oil-tank-farm-deal-with-india-358201

Later, the charred body of the victim, identified as Sanju Pradhan, was recovered from the spot.The incident occurred barely a fortnight after the Jharkhand Assembly passed the Prevention of Mob Violence and Mob Lynching Bill, 2021, which aims at providing “effective protection” of constitutional rights and the prevention of mob violence in the state.Pradhan was lynched allegedly by a mob near Besrajara Bazaar area, Kolebira police station in-charge Rameshwar Bhagat said. Hundreds of villagers who gathered around the spot alleged that the man was involved in the illegal felling of trees for stealing wood.The locals initially refused to hand over Pradhan’s body to the law enforcers. The police recovered the body after much persuasion.The Prevention of Mob Violence and Mob Lynching Bill, 2021, envisages imprisonment for those pronounced guilty of mob violence and lynching for periods ranging from three years to life term, besides imposition of fine and attachment of property. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jharkhand-man-lynched-set-on-fire-by-mob-for-felling-trees-358202

He has some more months left as the Governor and it is best to “ignore him and not give him any attention because that is what he appears to be aiming for”, according to a BJP leader.The leadership seems to have adopted a similar strategy with its Pilibhit MP Varun Gandhi, who too has been hitting out at the BJP with posts on social media.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-poll-on-mind-bjp-may-just-ignore-maliks-remark-358199

India added nearly one lakh (95,989) active cases in eight days with the load reaching 1,71,830 on Tuesday as against 75,841 on December 27 last year. The active cases are the ones that need hospital or home care and reflect the rising burden on health systems.Kerkhove, in a fresh warning, said, “While some reports do show a reduced risk of hospitalisation of Omicron compared to Delta, there are still far too many people infected, in hospital sick and dying from Omicron and Delta. We can prevent infections, save lives now. Nations must work for vaccine equity.”The WHO warning came on a day when French researchers reported a new variant with far more mutations than Omicron, which has 32 to 36 mutations in the spike protein the virus uses to attach to the human cells.Ringing the bell with their discovery of a cluster of 12 cases of Covid-19 variant with 46 mutations and 37 deletions, the French researchers said the cases came from southern France after an index patient returned from Cameroon. The new variant has been named IHU (B16402) and studies are underway to assess its transmissibility and vaccine escape potential.Back in India, chief of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation NK Arora said the third wave was very much here and could peak very soon.He said nearly 75% of all Covid cases in major metros of Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata were now of Omicron but added that the trajectory of infection in South Africa showed it could subside sooner. “In South Africa, Omicron cases rose rapidly through two weeks and then started to decline with most cases asymptomatic or mild,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/its-not-common-cold-warns-who-358184

The development comes before Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visits Colombo after bad blood due to a soured deal for fertilisers. The move is seen as a flag-for-flag response to a video by the Chinese state media purportedly showing PLA soldiers unfurling their national flag in the region three days back. The two armies had exchanged sweets and greetings on January 1 at 10 spots along the 3,488-km-long undemarcated boundary. Sources say the Chinese flag unveiling and sloganeering was not at Galwan valley where troops of both sides had clashed in June 2020.The video could have been shot anywhere along the Galwan river valley bed on the Chinese side. There are no geo coordinates to indicate that it was shot at the LAC, claim the sources. The image of Chinese troops shows white-coloured markings on the mountain. There is no marking visible on the mountains at the spot where the Galwan river enters Ladakh from Tibet.The Galwan river enters India after a sharp westward bend and some 7 km downstream joins the Shyok river for its onwards journey into the Indus. The LAC is close to the bend where the river takes a westward turn. Part of the valley is on the other side of the LAC and some part is in India. The images, which the Indian side clicked, showed a fully occupied post and small platoon of men clothed in winter clothing, snow boots and fully armed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tricolour-at-galwan-valley-army-defies-chinese-pitch-358187

Dozens of projects to improve the road, rail, air and waterways connectivity were going on in the state to achieve the objective, he said.Inaugurates 13 projects, lays stone for nine in ImphalNotably, the moniker, “Gateway of Northeast”, is normally used for Assam as it connects the N-E states with the rest of the country through road and rail link.PM Modi, who today inaugurated the new terminal building of the airport in Agartala built at a cost of Rs 3,400 crore, said the Centre was making huge investments in infrastructure building. “Tripura is slated to become the hub of business and trade of the N-E region,” he added.The PM said besides a three-fold increase in the airport capacity in terms of passenger movement and air traffic, more than a dozen aircrafts could be parked at the airport following the latest changes. The expansion of the airport, named after Tripura’s erstwhile monarch Maharaja Bir Bikram, would give a boost to the air connectivity of the entire N-E region, he said.The PM said trade and business of the entire NE region would get a big boost when the cold storage, being built at the domestic cargo terminal of the airport, would get ready.He added that while international water connectivity with Bangladesh gave Tripura a unique advantage, the Central Government was also pressing hard for establishing rail link between Agartala and Akhaura, Bangladesh.Modi, who was addressing a rally at Agartala’s Swami Vivekananda Maidan, also launched the Tripura Gram Samriddhi Yojana and Project Mission 100 of Vidyajyoti Schools. Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb were among those present at the rally.Earlier in the day, Modi visited Imphal, capital of Manipur where Assembly poll are slated to take place next month. He inaugurated 13 projects worth Rs 1,850 crore and laid the foundation stone for nine projects worth Rs 2,950 crore in Imphal. These projects relate to diverse sectors such as road infrastructure, drinking water supply, health, urban development, housing, information technology, skill development, art and culture, among others.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-working-to-make-tripura-gateway-of-northeast-modi-358195

Lord Krishna must be cursing them because he must be telling them when you were in power you did nothing for Mathura and Vrindavan,” Adityanath was quoted as saying in reference to the two holy cities in western UP linked to Lord Krishna.Recently, BJP leader Harnath Singh had said, “I had dreams that Yogi Adityanath ji should contest from Mathura and I felt that Lord Krishna was directing me to act as a mediator.” adding that he had also written to BJP president JP Nadda suggesting the same.Responding in a lighter vein, the SP supremo had on Monday said that Lord Krishna comes to his dream every night to tell him that he will form the next government and establish ‘Ram Rajya’ in Uttar Pradesh. “The way to Ram Rajya is through the path of ‘samajwad’ (socialism). The day ‘samajwad’ is established, the ‘Ram Rajya’ will be there in the state,” Akhilesh had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/religion-takes-centre-stage-in-up-political-arena-358196

Officials said the turnout for the event was much higher than permitted.The event was part of the party’s election campaign “Ladki Hoon, Lad Sakti Hoon” (I am girl, I can fight) in which hundreds of girls and women took part.While the Congress alleged that the incident was fallout of laxity on part of the district administration and a conspiracy, the BJP said the opposition party was making girls “pawns” for its “petty politics”.“Permission was given for 200 children. However, the number of those who actually turned up for the event was much higher,” City Magistrate Rajiv Pandey said, adding that the incident would be thoroughly probed and action would be initiated against the guilty. He said a few of the injured were admitted to the district hospital.Videos of the event showed there was no social distancing and many were not wearing masks, violating Covid protocols. As participants started the run, a few of them in the front tripped and fell on the ground, which led to a brief scare. The situation almost led to a stampede.Congress leader and former Bareilly Mayor Supriya Arom, who organised the event, later said there was nothing to worry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/three-girls-hurt-in-stampede-like-situation-in-cong-organised-run-358197

However, all officers of the level of Under Secretary and above have to attend office regularly.EC mulls stricter curbs for ralliesnew delhi: The Election Commission met here on Tuesday and discussed parameters to evolve fresh stricter Covid guidelines and protocol for political parties while organising rallies in the run-up to the Assembly polls in five states, including Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa.Active cases go up by nearly 1 lakh In 8 daysIndia added 95,989 active cases in 8 days with the load reaching 1,71,830 on Tuesday as against 75,841 on December 27 last.The guarded outlook by HDFC economists tallies with the Reserve Bank of India’s latest Financial Stability Report (FSR) which had noted that global economic recovery had started losing momentum in the second half of 2021-22 itself (October 2021 to March 2022) in the face of resurfacing Covid infections, the new variant Omicron, supply disruptions and bottlenecks, elevated inflationary levels, and shifts in monetary policy stances in advanced and emerging market economies.“With states imposing Covid-related restrictions (night curfew on movement of people, restaurants allowed at 50% capacity, offices to operate at 50 per cent capacity in various states), economic activity is likely to get impacted in Q4 of fiscal 2022,” they said.The downside risks are both from states imposing restrictions which might go into January 2022 as well as the slowdown in global recovery, pointed out by the RBI, which will weigh on the exports.The RBI might also desist from hiking interest rates as growth gets impacted. The RBI may continue with its focus on liquidity normalisation and capping yields, said the HDFC report while pointing out that Omicron cases are spreading at a faster pace in India and about 60 per cent of the overall infections are reported to be that of the new variant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/omicron-spread-stricter-curbs-may-hit-growth-by-0-3-in-q4-358183
05-01-2022||Mumbai||Rising Omicron cases can impact growth by 0.3% in March quarter: Report||Growth might be impacted by up to 0.30 per cent in the March quarter as normal economic activities come under pressure due to restrictions being imposed by more states to curb rising Omicron cases, economists at the country’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank said on Tuesday.The economists said they were earlier estimating Q4 growth to come at 6.1 per cent, which can get impacted by 0.2-0.3 per cent because of the Omicron threat.“With states imposing Covid-related restrictions (night curfew on movement of people, restaurants allowed at 50 per cent capacity, offices to operate at 50 per cent capacity in various states), economic activity is likely to get impacted in Q4FY22,” they said.The downside risks at the current juncture emanate from more states imposing restrictions, the restrictions extending beyond January 2022 and also a slowdown in global recovery which will weigh on the exports, they said in a note.Experience from previous waves during the Covid pandemic suggests that restrictions are imposed on mobility as Covid cases rise, which in turn has an impact on economic activity, they said.It said the Omicron cases are spreading at a faster pace in India and about 60 per cent of the overall infections are reported to be that of the new variant.The overall Omicron tally stood at 1,700 as of Monday but the actual number could be higher as India has very few testing facilities to check genome sequencing, it said, adding that some media reports peg the total Omicron cases at 18,000 in the country.The note also said that despite the threat of the Omicron, the rupee will stay range bound between Rs 74-76 to the greenback, and added that the RBI will intervene if the need arises.Rate hike expectations will moderate as the growth gets impacted and the reverse repo hike expected in February is also uncertain now, it said, adding that the central bank will continue with its focus on liquidity normalisation and capping yields. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rising-omicron-cases-can-impact-growth-by-0-3-in-march-quarter-report-358167
05-01-2022||New Delhi||Indian troops hoist National Flag in Ladakh's Galwan Valley on New Year||Photographs of Indian Army troops holding a large Tricolour in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley as part of New Year celebrations were released on Tuesday by sources in the security establishment, in a tit-for-tat response to a video by the Chinese state media purportedly showing PLA soldiers unfurling their national flag in the region three days back.Law Minister Kiren Rijiju, a lawmaker from Arunachal Pradesh that shares border with China, also posted on Twitter three photos with a caption “brave Indian Army soldiers in Galwan Valley on the occasion of #NewYear2022”.On January 1, China’s state media played up the video purportedly showing Chinese PLA soldiers sending New Year greetings to the Chinese people from Galwan Valley while resolving to “never yield an inch of land.”     The sources in the Indian security establishment said the site of the Chinese soldiers celebrating the New Year is in a depth area on their side near the Galwan Valley region and that it is not at all close to the buffer zone created in the region after the deadly clash that had taken place on June 15, 2020.The video shared by the Chinese media triggered reactions in India with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “break the silence” over Chinese “incursions” in the Galwan region of eastern Ladakh.The Opposition party has been targeting the Modi Government over its handling of Chinese incursions in eastern Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh.The ties between India and China nosedived significantly following the fierce clash in the Galwan Valley that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two countries in decades.In one of the photos, released by the sources in the Indian security establishment as part of the information warfare, around 30 Indian soldiers armed with Sig Sauer-716 assault rifles were seen with the National Flag.Another photo showed the group with four of them holding the flag and another Tricolour flying high on a flagpole adjacent to a temporary observation post. A flag of the Dogra regiment of the Indian Army is also seen in the photo.The sources said the photographs were of January 1 in the Galwan Valley.The Indian and Chinese troops exchanged sweets and greetings at 10 border points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) including in eastern Ladakh and North Sikkim on January 1, 2022, which was seen as a warm gesture in the midst of the lingering row in eastern Ladakh.In contrast to the Indian security establishment releasing photographs of the exchange of sweets and greetings on the New Year, China chose to play up the purported video.The attempt by the Chinese state media also came two days after China renamed some places in Arunachal Pradesh that drew a strong response from India.In its reaction, India asserted that Arunachal Pradesh has “always been” and will “always be” an integral part of India and that assigning “invented” names does not alter this fact.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5, 2020, following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas.Both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process last year in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake and in the Gogra area.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.The 13th round of Corps Commander-level military talks in October ended in a stalemate with the Indian Army saying that the “constructive suggestions” made by it were not agreeable to the Chinese side.In their virtual diplomatic talks on November 18, India and China agreed to hold the 14th round of military talks at an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement in remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh.It is learnt that the Chinese side is yet to respond to the next round of military talks.The defence ministry on Friday said it held several rounds of military talks with the Chinese side to deescalate the situation in eastern Ladakh without compromising on its stand of ‘complete disengagement and immediate restoration of status quo ante.India has been insisting on returning to the status quo that existed before the face-off took place in early May 2020.

If the lockdown is enforced again, it will badly affect everyone. But, if the daily Covid-19 cases cross the 20,000 mark, a lockdown will be implemented by the civic body and the state government as per the Union government’s rules,” Pednekar said.She appealed to citizens to follow Covid-19-appropriate behaviour, avoid overcrowding in markets, malls and marriage functions, and wear masks properly.The mayor also appealed to people to hold marriage functions as per the rules and ensure such events do not prove to be Covid-19 super-spreaders.She said currently, only six Omicron patients are admitted in Mumbai hospitals and all other persons infected by the new Covid-19 variant have been discharged.To check the spread of Covid-19 cases, the Mumbai civic body is conducting RT-PCR tests and distributing masks to those who don’t have them. The BMC is also focusing on vaccinating a maximum number of people, she added.“The civic body procured for free the vaccines sold to hospitals here by the Union government under the 25 per cent quota and administered them to citizens without taking charges. The vaccine doses are administered in societies, buildings and chawls and to groups of youths, senior citizens and women,” the mayor said.“If a ward has 20,000 homes, we have covered 15,000-16,000 of these homes,” she claimed.Pednekar said the Shiv Sena cancelled two programmes of the party due to the rise in Covid-19 cases.The mayor also appreciated Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar for his reported statement that he would not attend any function if more than 50 people are present.Mumbai is witnessing a huge surge in Covid-19 cases since the last week.On Monday, the country’s financial capital reported 8,082 Covid-19 cases, the highest daily count since April 18, 2021, taking the caseload beyond the eight lakh mark, while two more patients succumbed to the infection, the BMC earlier said.Mumbai also reported 40 new cases of the Omicron variant, pushing the number of such infections to 368 in the metropolis, according to the Maharashtra government’s health department.With fresh additions, the city’s coronavirus tally rose to 8,07,602, while the death toll increased to 16,379 on Monday, as per official data. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-will-be-imposed-in-mumbai-if-daily-covid-19-cases-go-past-20-000-mayor-358142

According to police, more arrests are likely.While a court in Mumbai remanded Jha in police custody till January 10, a court in the northern state granted city police four-day transit remand of Shweta Singh so that she could be brought here. She will be produced before the Mumbai court on Wednesday, said a senior police official.The Mumbai Police had registered a First Information Report (FIR) against unidentified persons following complaints that doctored photographs of hundreds of Muslim women were uploaded for ‘auction’ on an app called ‘Bulli Bai’, hosted on the open-source software platform GitHub.While there was no actual ‘auction’ or ‘sale’, the purpose of the app seemed to be to humiliate and intimidate the targeted women, many of whom are active social media users.A team of the Mumbai cyber police arrested Shweta Singh in Uttarakhand, an official said here, adding that she was operating multiple accounts related to the app.Engineering student Jha was detained in Bengaluru in connection with the case on Monday and later brought here.The Mumbai cyber police station has also registered a case against the app’s unidentified developers and Twitter handles which promoted it.Jha, said the senior police official, was operating a Twitter handle by the name ‘Khalsa Supremacist’, and had changed the names of some other fake handles to resemble Sikh names.Police will also probe whether there was any attempt to create religious tension in Punjab where elections are due this year, he said.Some other Twitter handles which promoted the app also had photographs or caricatures of Turbaned persons in their profile pictures and the posts in question contained text in the Punjabi script, in an apparent attempt to mislead about the identity, an official had said earlier.Mumbai police produced Vishal Kumar Jha before the Bandra metropolitan magistrate’s court here on Tuesday, and sought his custody for ten days.The court remanded him in police’s custody till January 10.It also granted the police permission to carry out searches at his house in Bengaluru.While seeking his custody, the police told the court that after the suspect detained in Uttarakhand (Shweta Singh, later arrested) was brought here and her custody was obtained, the two accused would be questioned together.“My client Vishal Jha has been falsely implicated in the case. He had no role in the creation of this app or any fake accounts. He is just a student,” his lawyer Dinesh Prajapati told PTI.Prajapati also denied that Jha knew Shweta.The Bulli Bai app (now blocked by GitHub) is the second case of this kind of sexual harassment and cyber-bullying targeting women from the minority community.A similar app and website called ‘Sulli Deals’ had come to light last year.Amid outrage, the Delhi Police has sought details from the GitHub platform about the developers of the ‘Bulli Bai’ mobile application and also asked Twitter to block and remove related “offensive contents”.The police also sought from Twitter information about the account handler who first tweeted about the app.Leaders from across the political spectrum condemned this cyber harassment and called for strict action against the culprits.Terming the matter as “serious”, the Delhi Minorities Commission has issued a notice to Delhi police chief Rakesh Asthana seeking an action-taken report by January 10.On Tuesday, Maharashtra Home Minister Dilip Walse-Patil and Minister of State for Home Satej Patil said strict action will be taken against the culprits.Satel Patil praised the “prompt action” by the Mumbai police, and said there seemed to be a “much bigger network” behind such coordinated crimes and the city police will unearth the “entire nexus that is enabling hate crimes against women in our country.”  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bulli-bai-app-row-woman-detained-from-uttarakhand-engineering-student-held-in-bengaluru-358116
