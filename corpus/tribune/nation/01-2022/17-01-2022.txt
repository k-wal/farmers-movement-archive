Mansukh, who had claimed that the vehicle had been stolen from his possession, was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5 last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/antilia-bomb-scare-case-former-mumbai-police-officer-sachin-waze-moves-delhi-hc-362093

The OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) has also observed that the people who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with the Covid-19 virus should minimize close direct contact with animals, including wildlife,” the affidavit read.The affidavit has been filed in response to Surat Parsi Panchayat Board’s plea seeking relaxation in the existing SOP/norms for disposal of Covid-19 positive bodies to allow traditional burial for the members of the Parsi community.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud on Monday that it was not an adversarial issue and the government was ready to consider suggestions of the community.As senior advocate Fali S Nariman said he will get in touch with the Solicitor General and will try to sort it out, the Bench posted the matter for hearing after two weeks.                                     #corona                                     #coronavirus                                     #Covid                                     #funeral                                     #parsi                                     #SC                                     #towerofsilence||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-not-permissible-to-relax-norms-for-disposal-of-bodies-as-per-parsi-rites-says-centre-362090

We may have to ban this mobile business. Mr counsel, you are now practising in the Supreme Court and you appear regularly. Can’t you afford to have a desktop to argue,” a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.The CJI’s comments came after his Bench was forced to adjourn hearings in around 10 cases due to repeated audio-visual disruptions from advocates’ end during the proceedings in the pre-lunch session.“We have no energy to hear cases like this. Please devise a system by which we can hear you. Ten matters are over like this and we are shouting,” said a visibly upset CJI.Later, a circular issued by the top court’s Registry requested all advocates and party-in-person to join “the court hearings through video conference via a desktop/laptop with a stable internet connection, preferably wired, to avoid any disruption in the court proceedings and inconvenience to the Hon’ble Judges.”It also advised them to avoid joining the video conference hearings through mobile phones and close all background applications running on their devices for best video conference experience.The top court has been functioning in virtual mode via video-conferencing since March 2020 due to the pandemic and has been relaxing or tightening the conditions from time to time keeping in mind the changing pandemic situation.In view of a sudden spike in the number of Covid-19 cases across India, on January 2 it decided to hear all matters in virtual mode and from January 7 with judges joining the hearings from their residential offices.                                     #CJI                                     #disruptions                                     #lawyers                                     #SC                                     #virtualhearings||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-you-afford-to-have-a-desktop-to-argue-cji-asks-lawyers-using-mobile-phones-362083
17-01-2022||Mumbai||Maharashtra Congress chief says can beat up Modi; was referring to local goon, he clarifies later||Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole found himself in the middle of a controversy on Monday after a video of him saying he can “beat up” and “badmouth Modi” went viral, prompting the BJP to launch an attack on him.Patole, however, later said he was not referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi but a local village goon.In a purported video, which was tweeted by a channel and then by Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, Patole is seen talking to villagers in Bhandara district and can be purportedly heard saying: “I can beat Modi, I can badmouth him. Which is why he came to campaign against me”.  In his defence, Patole said citizens had complained to him about a local goon named Modi in his constituency, adding that the video of him talking to villagers was "viciously" being made viral on social media. “Let me clarify again that I was not talking about the Prime Minister, but about a local goon named Modi," Patole asserted. Latching on to the purported comment, Fadnavis said that the prime minister was stuck on the road for 20 minutes in Punjab and the Congress chief minister there did not even take note of it. “Now, the Maharashtra Congress chief says he can beat up Modi and badmouth him. What is happening with the Congress. The party, which at some point of time, was involved in the freedom struggle, has stopped this low,” Fadnavis tweeted. Fadnavis went on to say that Patole had grown only physically, not mentally.                                      #Congresschief                                     #Fadnavis                                     #Maharashtra                                     #Modi                                     #NanaPatole                                     #video||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-congress-chief-says-can-beat-up-modi-later-clarifies-was-referring-to-local-goon-362080

The IAC has been built at a cost of around Rs 23,000 crore and its construction propelled India into a select group of countries having capabilities to build state-of-the-art aircraft carriers.President Ram Nath Kovind and Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu visited the ship recently here.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aircraft-carrier-vikrant-completes-third-sea-trials-returns-to-kochi-harbour-362079

17-01-2022||Vijay Mohan||Covid-19 disinfectant technology developed by CSIO being installed in Parliament, rail coaches, enclosed spaces||Chandigarh, January 17Technology developed recently by the Central Scientific Instruments Organisation (CSIO), Chandigarh, is being installed to combat the Covid-19 pandemic in railway coaches, air conditioned buses and other indoor spaces, including Parliamnt and election campaign-related meetings.The Ultraviolet (UV-C) based technology developed by CSIO under the aegis of the Council of Scientific and Industrial research (CSIR) is said to be effective for mitigation of airborne transmission of SARS-COV-2 and will also remain relevant in post-Covid era.The technology has been successfully tried in railways, buses and even in the Parliament House, and is now open for general roll-out for use by the common masses, according to a statement issued by the Science and Technology, today.The Railways had carried out trials of the technology for a month in coaches on the Bandra to Chandigarh route, covering a distance of 1,000 km. Railway’s Research Designs and Standards Organisation, Lucknow, has recommended its use in all Railways coaches in a phased manner.The technology has been developed according to the requirements for deactivation of SARS COV-2 virus contained in an aerosol with necessary ventilation measures, necessary safety and user guidelines and tested bio-safety standards. UV-C deactivates viruses, bacteria, fungus and other bio-aerosols with appropriate dosages of 254nm UV light, the statement added.It uses UV lights installed in the air conditioning and ventilation ducts to kill the virus and bacteria present in re-circulated air and is suitable for installation in auditoriums, conference halls, classrooms, malls and offices.Speaking virtually after releasing the CSIR Guidelines on Disinfection Technologies for Mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 Transmission, Dr Jitendra Singh, Minister of State for Science and Technology; Earth Sciences; PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, said that that CSIR will write to the Election Commission of India for use of this technology during indoor meetings with limited capacity during the ensuing state assembly elections in five states as the commission has imposed a ban on physical rallies and road shows for a specific period.The Commission had, however, recently allowed indoor meetings in the poll-bound states with a maximum attendance of 300 persons or 50 percent capacity of the hall or auditorium, subject to adherence to other Covid protocols.The technology was installed in the Central Hall, Lok Sabha Chamber and two committee rooms of Parliament in July last year ahead of the monsoon session. Dr Jitendra said that he will take up a case to with the Secretary General of Rajya Sabha for installation of this technology ahead of the upcoming budget session.Installation of this technology notwithstanding, strict adhere to Covid protocols, including the use of face mask, maintaining social distance, avoiding crowds maintai9ning personal hygiene and use of hand sanitisers has been highly recommended to check the spread Covid.                                     #Covid                                     #CSIO                                     #CSIR                                     #SARSCOV2                                     #Ultraviolet||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-disinfectant-technology-developed-by-csio-being-installed-in-parliament-rail-coaches-enclosed-spaces-362074
17-01-2022||Mumbai||‘Bulli Bai’ case accused used Sikh names in accounts to create animosity: Cops to court||Three students arrested in connection with a case pertaining to the ‘Bulli Bai’ app, which targeted Muslim women, deceptively used names belonging to the Sikh community for their social media accounts with an intention to breach peace in the society and create animosity among religious groups, the Mumbai police told a local court on Monday.The city police’s cyber cell submitted its affidavit before the metropolitan magistrate in suburban Bandra opposing the bail pleas filed by the three accused in the case - Vishal Kumar Jha, Shweta Singh and Mayank Rawat.Singh (18) and Rawat (21) were arrested by the Mumbai police’s cyber cell from Uttarakhand on January 5, while Jha was nabbed from Bengaluru on January 4. All three are currently in judicial custody with Jha and Rawat quarantined in a BMC-run facility after they tested positive for coronavirus.The court heard the arguments put forth by the accused’s advocates and posted the bail applications for further hearing on Tuesday.The police on Monday sought the court to reject their bail pleas, arguing the accused could flee or tamper with evidence in the case.The cyber cell added that a police team has been sent to the national capital to seek custody of two more persons – Niraj Bishnoi, arrested in another Bulli Bai app case lodged by the Delhi police, and one Omkareshwar Thakur, apprehended in the ‘Sulli’ deals app case.According to the police’s affidavit, Jha, Singh and Rawat were part of several social media groups operating with a specific mindset.“The accused were highly active on social media and were posting material which could cause breach of peace in the society,” it said.These accused falsely included names and words from the Sikh community in their Twitter handles and also while posting messages through these social media accounts with an intention to create animosity between two religions, the affidavit maintained.“The timely arrest of the accused persons has prevented a law-and-order situation,” it said, adding the police were still on the look-out for other accused in the case.“The accused persons have created the Bulli Bai app by impersonating as Sikh group followers and the intention behind this needs to be ascertained through further probe,” the police said.They added that further investigation was required to ascertain if any person was instigating the arrested accused to target women from a particular community.“Probe is also on to see if there was any monetary gains by the accused for which bank statements (of the arrested accused) has to be looked into,” the affidavit said.“Preliminary probe has revealed that apart from the Bulli Bai app, the arrested accused were also active in the ‘Sulli’ deals app of July 2021 and further probe is required to be done with this regard,” the police said.The police’s affidavit further said that all the three accused – Rawat, Singh and Jha - knew Bishnoi, an engineering student, arrested by the Delhi police.The Delhi police’s special cell, which nabbed Bishnoi from Assam, has claimed he was the main creator of the Bulli Bai app.“The four accused were among those who created the Bulli Bai app,” the Mumbai police affidavit said.It added that the three accused are students and have good knowledge of the cyber world.“The accused tried to hide their location history while using their social media accounts by showing that they have logged in from other countries. Their accounts also hide their true identity,” the police said.“As per investigation carried out so far, the trio during their custodial interrogation have accepted that the Bulli Bai app was created by Twitter accounts @giyu84, @giyu44 and @giyu94. These three accounts used the GitHub platform to set up the app,” the police said.These three accounts were operated by Bishnoi, police said.The police told the court that all the three accused were operating multiple social media accounts on Twitter, Instagram and Gmail.The cyber cell further said many of the accounts were deleted or suspended for posting defamatory content and information regarding the same is yet to be procured.The Mumbai police registered an FIR in the case following complaints made by several women, who were targeted by the ‘Bulli Bai’ app.The app made public the details of several Muslim women, allowing users to participate in their ‘auction’.                                      #BulliBai                                     #Mumbai                                     #Sikhcommunity                                     #socialmedia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bulli-bai-case-accused-used-sikh-names-in-accounts-to-create-animosity-cops-to-court-362062
17-01-2022||Lucknow||MSP for every crop, free irrigation, cane arrear in 15 days: Akhilesh's promises to farmers||Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday made several promises to the farmers of Uttar Pradesh including MSP for every crop, free irrigation facilities, payment of arrears to cane-growers in 15 days, interest-free loans, and insurance and pension. Yadav also said that cases lodged against farmers during their agitation against the now-repealed farm laws would be withdrawn, and the families of farmers who died during the protest would be given Rs 25 lakh each.Speaking to the media here, the SP supremo said all these promises would be part of the party's election manifesto for the assembly elections in the state.He said a special 'Farmers Revolving Fund' would be created, if needed, to ensure the payment of arrears to sugarcane farmers in 15 days.Before announcing the blueprint, the SP chief took an "Anna Sankalp" (food commitment) to express his firm resolve for the welfare of the farmers in the state.He said the party has already vowed to provide 300 units of electricity to everybody.The Samajwadi Party, which has entered into an alliance with the Rashtriya Lok Ddal, is trying to cash in on the recent farmers' agitation.The western Uttar Pradesh, from where many farmers had participated in the stir against the agri-marketing laws on Delhi borders, is scheduled to vote in the first phase of voting on February 10. Rakesh Tikait, one of the more prominent faces of the year-long agitation, hails from this region, While explaining in detail his party's plan for the farmers, the SP chief did not miss an opportunity to attack the BJP, accusing it of neglecting farmers during its rule."The BJP in its 2017 polls manifesto had promised to double the income of the farmers. Has it been achieved?" he asked.Referring to the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which four farmers were knocked down by a four-wheeler in October last year, the former chief minister said the incident was even worse than the infamous Jallianwala Bagh case during British rule."In the Jallianwala Bagh case innocent people were killed by the Britishers by shooting them I their chest, but in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident innocent farmers returning home were crushed under the wheels of the vehicle," he said.The SP chief also took a swipe at the BJP for "not initiating any action" against Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra Teni whose son Ashish has been described by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) as the main accused of the October 3 killings. Ashish is lodged in jail in the case that raised concern across the country.Reacting to Yadav's promises, Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh tweeted in Hindi, "Those who used to roam around with a gun in their hand, are pretending to be the well-wishers of farmers. During their regime, our farmers used to fear going to their farms during the night."  While Minimum Support Price (MSP) is at present provided on some selected crops, the SP chief promised to cover all the crops under the safety net.   The SP supremo was accompanied by Tejinder Singh Virk, who had led the farmers' protest in Lakhimpur Kheri against the visit of Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to Ajay Mishra's native place. Virk had alleged that the vehicles that ran over the protesters that day also targeted him. Asked if Virk would be fielded by the party in the current elections, Yadav was non-committal. “He is a respected person for his party.”  To another question about whether the Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikiat will get the SP nomination in the polls, Yadav mockingly replied, “If you bring him to me I will certainly consider so”.                                      #Akhilesh                                     #farmers                                     #MSP                                     #SP                                     #UPassemblypolls                                     #UPPolls                                     #UPpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/msp-for-every-crop-free-irrigation-cane-arrear-in-15-days-akhileshs-promises-to-farmers-362054
17-01-2022||Vibha SharmaNew Delhi||BJP dismisses, expels Uttrakhand minister Harak Singh Rawat||The ruling BJP has dismissed Harak Singh Rawat, a cabinet minister in the Uttarakhand Government, and expelled him from the primary membership of the party. Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has written to the Governor, informing about the decision.Harak Singh’s expulsion shows the BJP does not tolerate indiscipline or bow down to pressure of any kind, party leaders said.Dhami said Harak Singh was expelled as he was “mounting pressure” for tickets to family members for the upcoming polls. “The BJP tried to take him along despite the fact that he caused considerable issues but when he began mounting pressure for a ticket for himself as well as family members, the party had to take a decision,” Dhami said, adding that the BJP is against “dynasty politics and follows the path of development and nationalism”.Senior leaders also quoted the case of Utpal Parrikar, a son of late leader Manohar Parrikar who has been seeking a BJP ticket from Panaji—a seat that his father represented for several years—and late Ananth Kumar who used to contest from Bangalore South, now represented by Tejasvi Surya.“The BJP is clear...no one is bigger than the party,” they said.Harak Singh is believed to have been seeking at least “three” tickets.Dhami said: “We will not give tickets to two people from the same family. We have decided not to give a ticket to more than one person from a family. Our party has always been against it”.Denying any division in the party, he said: “No BJP MLA is going anywhere”.An emotional Harak Singh accused the BJP of removing him without speaking to him.Predicting a victory for the Congress, Harak Singh said: “They (BJP) did not talk to me once before taking such a big decision. If I had not left Congress to join BJP, I would have resigned from the BJP four years ago. I don’t have much interest in being a minister, I just wanted to work for the welfare of people”.Denying that he was already in talks with the party, he claimed the BJP will not be able to do ‘thod-phod’ in other parties like they had earlier now. “The wind is blowing in favour of Congress and I will work for the party that comes to power,” said Harak Singh, one of MLAs who rebelled against Congress leader Harish Rawat and switched to the BJP in 2016.Harish Rawat though did not seem too elated at the prospect of his bete noire returning to the party.  Representing the Kotdwar seat, Harak Singh is believed to have been demanding a ticket for daughter-in-law Anukriti Gusain from Lansdowne and a change of seat for himself.For the past few weeks several attempts were made by the BJP to placate him. Dhami also met him over lunch over his demand for a medical college in his constituency after he threatened to quit. At the same time, he is also believed to have been holding “secret meetings” with Congress leaders, much to the chagrin of the BJP leaders.“The highly ambitious Harak Singh wants to become the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand. He was instrumental in getting Trivendra Singh Rawat being removed as the CM last year. His relationship with Harish Rawat is well known,” observers say.A regular party hopper, Harak Singh has been in different political parties in past three decades.Notably both Congress and BJP have held meetings to finalise the name of candidates. Apparently, some Congress members willing to switch sides are also in touch with the BJP, say sources.                                       #BJP                                     #cabinetminister                                     #expelled                                     #government                                     #HarakSinghRawat                                     #Harishrawat                                     #PushkarDhami                                     #Uttarakhand                                     #Uttarakhandpolls                                     #Uttarakhandpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-dismisses-expels-uttrakhand-minister-harak-singh-rawat-362051

17-01-2022||Vibha Sharma||BJP reaches out to 'jats' in western UP, Sanjeev Balyan meets BKU president Naresh Tikait||New Delhi, January 17A day after Naresh Tikait purportedly announced support to the Samajwadi Party-Rashtriya Lok Dal combine in the upcoming Assembly polls, senior BJP leader and union minister Sanjeev Balyan on Monday visited the BKU president at his residence in Sisauli village in Muzaffarnagar, while his brother Rakesh Tikait said the key farmers' union has not extended support to any political party.“We did not extend any support, people have made a mistake in understanding,” Rakesh Tikait said after a video of Naresh Tikait extending support to the SP-RLD emerged.“If someone comes to your house, you do say ‘we are with you’. It does not mean that we are telling whom to vote for. We have decided that we (BKU) will not support anyone. Even if we are against the government, everyone (the people) knows what they have to do,” Rakesh Tikait said.Interestingly, Rakesh Tikait also said that Yogi (Adityanath) must win elections from (Gorakhpur) "as we need strong opposition in the State".Notably, in the very first ‘mahapanchayat’ in Muzaffarnagar during the farm laws' agitation, last year, Naresh Tikait said the “mistake” made by ‘jats and khaps’ in the 2019 by not supporting late RLD leader Ajit Singh will be rectified in 2022 Assembly elections.In his last Lok Sabha elections from Muzaffarnagar, Ajit Singh lost by a narrow margin to Balyan.He got 5,67,254 votes against Balyan’s 5,73,780.The BKU, especially Rakesh Tikait, has played a key role in the year-long agitation against the now repealed farm laws.According to Balyan, who belongs to the same ‘khap’ (Balyan) as Tikait brothers, it was a courtesy call.“Naresh Tikait had undergone a medical procedure a few days ago. We are like a family…we keep meeting often…I came here to know about his health. He is recovering well. We had a good meeting,” the BJP’s Muzaffarnagar MP said.A key part of the saffron strategy for poll-bound agrarian states Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand is to make amends with the politically significant and apparently still upset ‘jat’ community by reaching out to their leaders.Though BJP leaders claim that all ‘khaps’ in Western UP will support the party like they had in the 2014 Lok Sabha, the 2017 Assembly and the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “Jats are very happy with the governance of Chief Minister Yogi Aditayanth, they will not forget what happened in 2013 (Muzaffarnagar riots),” state BJP spokesperson Anila Singh said.So far, both Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of farmer unions, and the BKU, have refrained from promoting any political party.The SKM has also warned of launching ‘Mission UP’ (against the BJP) from February 1 if the centre failed to fulfil its promises, including formation of a committee on MSP and cancellation of police cases against protesters.“We will observe January 31 as ‘Vishwasghat Diwas’ (betrayal day) and hold nationwide protests at block and district headquarters’ level,” the SKM has warned.The SKM will also support the countrywide strike on January 23 and 24 called by central trade unions.Rakesh Tikait is also scheduled to visit Lakhimpur Kheri on January 21 where he will meet the farmers and decide upon the future course of the agitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-reaches-out-to-jats-in-western-up-union-minister-sanjiv-balyan-meets%C2%A0naresh-tikait-in-sisauli-362036

At the same time, the role of our doctors, nurses and healthcare workers is exceptional. When we see glimpses of people being vaccinated in remote areas, or our healthcare workers taking the vaccines there, our hearts and minds are filled with pride,” said the PM, assuring that India’s approach to fighting the pandemic would always remain science-based.As India recorded 2,71,202 new Covid cases on Sunday marking an eight-month high and active cases (in need of home or hospital care) touched a 225-day peak of 15,50,377, the PM said the government was augmenting health infrastructure and urged everyone to keep following Covid protocols to overcome the pandemic.Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya released a commemorative stamp to mark one year of the vaccination drive. The stamp features a health worker administering the indigenous shot Covaxin to a senior citizen.Importantly for the region, Himachal Pradesh earned accolades today for leading the way throughout the vaccination journey. As of Sunday, Himachal was among the only four states and UTs (others being Andaman and Nicobar Islands, J&K and Lakshadweep) to have achieved the target of 100% vaccination of all adults. Earlier it was the first state to administer the first dose to 100% adults while Kinnaur became the first fully vaccinated district in the country, achieving the target 50 days in advance.The Health Ministry today hailed Himachal a leader in the vaccination campaign, mentioning the state in a compilation to mark the milestone.

We applied for India's regulator’s approval,” he said. Moscow has already permitted Sputnik M for teenagers. TNSRisk less, cost extremely highThere is no relation between opening schools and spread of Covid. The risks for children are low and cost is extremely high. Jaime Saavedra, world bank’s global education directorSaavedra, whose team has been tracking the impact of Covid-19 on the education sector, says there is no evidence that reopening schools has caused a surge in Covid cases and that schools are not a “safe place”.He also asserted that it did not make sense from public-policy perspective to wait till children were vaccinated as there was “no science” behind it.“There is no relation between opening schools and spread of Covid. There is no evidence linking the two and there is no justification now to keep the schools closed,” Saavedra said in an interview from Washington.“It does not make sense to keep restaurants, bars and shopping malls open and keep schools closed. There is no excuse,” he added.According to various simulations by the World Bank, health risks for children if schools are opened are low and the cost of the closure is extremely high.“During 2020, we were navigating in a sea of ignorance. We just didn’t know what is the best way of combating the pandemic and the immediate reaction of most countries in the world was let’s close schools. Time has passed since then and with evidence coming in from late 2020 and 2021, we have had several waves and there are several countries which have opened schools,” he said.“We have been able to see if schools opening have had an impact in the transmission of virus and new data shows it doesn’t. Many counties have also had waves when schools were closed so obviously there has been no role of schools in some of the spikes.

It will lay down guidelines which items can be imported and why.The purchase of Quick Reaction Surface to Air Missiles (QR-SAM), which was being done from global sources, is now on ‘buy Indian’ list. Only Indian firms will be able to supply the missile for Army’s air-defence system.Similarly, the all-terrain vehicles used in high-altitude areas will only be sourced from Indian vendors. The light machine guns (LMGs) for the Army will also be sourced from local sources. A decision in this regard was taken at a high-level virtual meeting on Friday. The decision to add more items on the ‘import ban’ list is expected in the coming week.The Tribune had first reported in its January 12 edition that only cutting-edge technology will be imported and that too will have some kind of clause of servicing and maintaining the equipment. Import could be allowed in items such as aircraft engines, armed drones and long-range planes, among others.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had last month said at an industry event that it will be ‘make in India’ for military equipment in future.Within the Ministry of Defence, a policy is being crafted that will allow import of only specific items which cannot be produced in India. This will lay down guidelines which items can be imported and why. It is called ‘Defence Production and Export Promotion Policy’.The review will provide the list of items that cannot be imported and those which could be made in India.                                     #ATV                                     #Importban                                     #Makeindia                                     #Missiles||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/missiles-all-terrain-vehicles-lmgs-on-import-ban-list-361929

Nishad said he would meet senior BJP leaders, including Amit Shah, in Delhi on Monday to finalise the constituencies where the party will field its candidates. PTI“SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is ready to throw western UP into communal fires yet again… People responsible for the Kairana exodus are being given tickets. Also on SP’s list are rioters of Muzaffarnagar and professional history-sheeters,” Yogi said on Sunday, raking 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots that drew deep chasms between the dominant local Jats and Muslims, yielding electoral advantage to the BJP in 2014 Lok Sabha elections, and until later.Pulling out history sheets of some of the candidates the SP has fielded in western UP, the CM on Sunday reminded the locals of the exodus of Hindu families from Kairana after the Muzaffarnagar riots and warned them against potential recurrences. The CM’s reference was to Nahid Hasan whom the SP has fielded from the communally sensitive Kairana segment that bore a massive brunt of Muzaffarnagar riots.“By fielding Hasan, the SP has exhibited its true communal colours. Hasan has 17 cases registered against him in Shamli and Saharanpur districts,” Yogi said                                     #UPassemblypolls                                     #YogiAdityanath||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yogi-rakes-up-muzaffarnagar-says-rioters-on-sp-list-of-candidates-361930
17-01-2022||---||Modi government mulls bringing crypto under tax net||New Delhi, January 16After shelving a law to regulate cryptocurrencies, an attempt to bring them under government’s gaze by taxing them is again on the cards.The government is looking at taxing cryptocurrencies as a whole or at one of the three stages — mining or when it is created; used as a capital asset; or when used for a transaction. The broad consensus is to tax it under the head “Income from other sources” for transactions and charge capital gains tax on its trading.The endeavour is proving to be much harder than earlier thought. The first attempt was made in the 2018 Union Budget but never followed through as the Supreme Court began hearing a case in this regard. A year later, it asked the government to frame crypto-currency regulation policies which may now be introduced in the forthcoming Budget session.Taxing rather than banning cryptocurrencies is considered a better option for India, which has the highest number of crypto owners, mainly youngsters, though the cumulative investment is modest.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has already said “the government will take measures to eliminate use of crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system. The focus, however, would be on the distributed ledger system or blockchain technology that allows organisation to record and authenticate transactions without the need of intermediaries.”                                     #cryptocurrency                                     #cyrptotaxlaws                                     #ModiGovernment||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-mulls-bringing-crypto-under-tax-net-361932

Banerjee wrote she was “profoundly shocked and hurt” by “abrupt” exclusion of the proposed tableau of the West Bengal Government from the R-Day parade without assigning any reason.“The tableau was commemorating the contributions of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and his INA on his 125th birth anniversary and was carrying the portraits of some of the most illustrious sons and daughters of the country,” Banerjee wrote in the letter addressed to PM.Urging the Prime Minister to reconsider the decision, Mamata said the tableau would be the most befitting way to pay respect and homage to those who fought for the country’s freedom.The Congress also attacked the Centre for rejecting the tableau proposed by Bengal.In a letter addressed to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Congress MP from Berhampore Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said, “This is an insult to the people of West Bengal, our cultural heritage and our great hero Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Netaji is not only the pride of West Bengal, but the entire nation.”                                     #Bosetableau                                     #Mamtabanerjee                                     #ModiMamta                                     #PMModi                                     #RDayparade||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-writes-to-pm-over-rejection-of-boses-tableau-361933

He asked the Election Commission to take cognisance of the issue and send them back, failing which, he said elections might not remain impartial. PTI“People have made up their mind (on who to elect). In the first two phases, the BJP will win around 83 seats like the last time. The people of Uttar Pradesh have given a clear majority in the past elections. This time also they will give a clear majority,” the senior leader said.Shah is expected to begin his tour after Saturday and hold meetings, including with organisational leaders, and cover the entire stretch of UP, the senior leader said, adding that the first two phases are crucial as the momentum generated there will carry forward in the remaining five phases.Dismissing any adverse effect on BJP’s fortunes due to the exit of OBC leader Swami Prasad Maurya and others, he said Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath gave “OBCs, in fact all castes, due representation in his Cabinet and also made Keshav Prasad Maurya his deputy”. “Representation backward castes like Maurya, Saini or Nunia have received in the organisation and the government is there for all to see,” he added.                                     #AmitShah                                     #BJPcampaign                                     #Shahhitstrail                                     #UPBJP                                     #UPPolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shah-may-hit-campaign-trail-in-up-next-week-361934
