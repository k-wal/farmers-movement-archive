In order to avoid further damage to the German Navy, the Bundeswehr, but above all to Germany, I consider this step necessary,” said the German Navy Chief Kay-Achim Schönbach.Lost in the furore were his comments during a lecture at the Manohar Parrikar Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis here on Friday that China was a greater threat. “Even India and Germany need Russia against China,” he had said.The German chief had timed his visit to coincide with the docking of frigate ‘Bayern’ in Mumbai which had marked Berlin’s symbolic presence in South China Sea.“I believe in Christianity and there we have a Christian country, even if Putin is an atheist. It doesn’t matter. Having this big country, even if it’s not a democracy, on our side as a bilateral partner, gives them a chance with the EU and also the US, having them on eye level. It is easy,” he had added.The next day first the German Ministry of Defence disowned his comments and sought an explanation.Terming his comments in India as a “mistake” and “misjudged in the situation”, German Navy Chief Kay-Achim Schönbach said, “What he really wants is respect. And, my God, giving someone respect is low cost, even no cost. If I was asked it is easy to even give him the respect he really demands and probably also deserves.”What may have cost his job were his comments on Crimea which led to the Ukraine Foreign Office summoning the German Ambassador in Kiev.The new German coalition government may also be trying to overcorrect as it is under fire from hardliners in Europe and the US for not permitting overflight of planes carrying US weapons to Ukraine. On the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, he said “the Crimean Peninsula is gone. It will never come back” while dismissing the idea that Russia wanted to take over Ukrainian territory as “nonsense”.                                     #Crimea                                     #GermanNavyChief                                     #Putin                                     #Russia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/german-navy-chief-quits-after-comments-made-in-india-363810
23-01-2022||New Delhi||Drowning in losses, Delhi traders slam weekend curfew, odd-even rule||Weekend curfew and odd-even rule have hit the businessmen hard in the city with many of them struggling to meet break-even.Some of the traders PTI spoke to contemplated mortgaging jewellery to meet the rising expenses or even cutting down on meals to save money.Lalit, a grocery shop owner in Khari Bawli area of Old Delhi, said odd-even has impacted them specially as most of the customers would not know which days the shop would be open.“There is no business at all. We are facing 100 per cent losses. Ours is a wholesale market and customers come here to buy in bulk. But they are keeping away due to the odd-even rule,” Lalit said.“They would not know which shop is open on which day. More than the weekend curfew the odd-even rule for opening of shops has been responsible for losses.”Businessmen have urged Delhi LG Anil Baijal to consider removing curbs.On January 21, the Delhi government had proposed the Delhi LG to withdraw weekend curfew and the odd-even system but the proposal was rejected.Ashok Randhawa, president of Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Traders’ Association, expressed worry over the unsold garments due to lack of customers.“Curbs should be eased for us. Shopkeepers have bought winter stuff and with no customers now to buy them, where will they keep the stuff till next year? They don’t have money to afford rent for a godown.”He said the situation has forced workers at these shops to return to their hometown.“Most workers at these shops come from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. They stay here on rent but with shops opening on odd-even basis, shopkeepers are forced to pay them for the number of days the shop opens, like say for 10 days.“Many of them have left for their home since they were unable to make ends meet,” Randhawa said.He said the government should at least allow those markets to open that have received the ‘fully vaccinated’ certificate from the district authorities.Mohan Kapoor, a shopkeeper in Tilak Nagar market of West Delhi, rued the lack of business and said he has cut down on meals to save some money.“I have stopped having lunch and eat only a single meal during the day. My wife and I ensure that our child eats three meals but we have cut down on our meals,” he said.Kapoor said just when he had begun to recover from the losses from the two previous lockdowns, the current curbs brought him down.A shopkeeper, who sells cosmetics items for women in Tilak Nagar, said he might be forced to mortgage his wife’s jewellery to pay bills.“My shop is on rent. I have to pay EMI for my house I bought before the 2020 lockdown. All my savings were exhausted during the last two lockdowns,” he said.“If the curbs are not eased soon, I might have to mortgage by wife’s jewellery to meet the expenses,” he added.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain has been saying that the hospitalisation rate has stagnated in the national capital, indicating that the current wave has reached a plateau.The number of daily cases and the positivity rate has also shown a decline in the last few days. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/drowning-in-losses-delhi-traders-slam-weekend-curfew-odd-even-rule-363804
23-01-2022||---||Hate speech: Hindu outfits move SC, seek action against Muslim leaders, clerics||New Delhi, January 23Ahead of the hearing on a PIL seeking action against those who delivered hate speeches during the Haridwar ‘Dharam Sansad’ last month, two Hindu groups have moved the Supreme Court seeking a probe into similar speeches by Muslim politicians and clerics against Hindus.Lucknow-based Hindu Front for Justice and Delhi-based Hindu Sena wanted the top court to direct the state governments concerned to state governments to register FIRs against the Muslim leaders/clerics who delivered provocative against Hindus.Such utterances created an atmosphere of fear and unrest in the Hindu community reminding them of the working of Muslim League which resulted in India’s partition.They cited several instances of hate speech by Muslim leaders/clerics, including those by All India Majlis-e Ittehadul Muslimeen leaders Akbaruddin Owaisi and Waris Pathan, AAP leader Amanatullah Khan, Islamiic preacher Taukeer Raza and Urdu poet Munawar Rana.Hindu Front for Justice alleged that “some leader and preachers of Muslim community have been propagating against Hindu religion, community, their gods and goddesses and even against the sovereignty of India. The provocative speeches delivered by Muslim leaders have created an atmosphere of fear and unrest in Hindu community reminding them of the working of Muslim League which resulted in the partition of the country”.The Supreme Court had on January 12 issued notice to the Centre, Uttarakhand Government and Delhi Police on a PIL seeking action against those responsible for delivering hate speeches during the ‘Dharam Sansad’ held at Haridwar and an event organized by ‘Hindu Yuva Vahini’ in Delhi last month.Asking them to respond to the PIL filed by journalist Qurban Ali and senior advocate Anjana Prakash, a Bench led by CJI NV Ramana had posted the matter for further hearing after 10 days. It’s likely to come up for hearing in the week beginning on January 24.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hate-speech-hindu-outfits-move-sc-seek-action-against-muslim-leaders-clerics-363803
23-01-2022||New Delhi||'Bose' moved to Edward Park in 70s; now his new statue to assume King George canopy||Nearly 50 years after a statue of freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose replaced that of King Edward VII in Old Delhi, ‘Netaji’ is now set to take the hallowed space left behind by his son King George V under an ornamental canopy facing the India Gate.In 1939, an imposing marble statue of King George V at the site near India Gate was unveiled by the then viceroy as a memorial to the British monarch under whose reign the capital of ‘New Delhi’ was built, according to archival records.However, it and the statue of King Edward VII were ousted in the late 1960s and dumped at the site of the 1911 royal durbar in northwest Delhi, now known as Coronation Park.The canopy at the India Gate, which has been lying empty since 1968, will house a granite statue of Netaji, with official sources saying its installation will be a case of India “reclaiming” its history.In Old Delhi, the heroic statue of Netaji along with his INA compatriots was installed at the ‘Subhas Park’ in 1975, which was earlier called the ‘Edward Park’, near Jama Masjid, heritage activist Sohail Hashmi said.‘Edward Park’ till the late 60s had an imposing equestrian statue of King Edward VII in the garden built in his memory, whose foundation was laid by his son King George V on December 8, 1911, and it was unveiled by George’s son and then Prince of Wales Edward in 1922 during his royal tour of India.While the statue of Edward VII found its way to Toronto later, the towering marble statue of King George V in durbar regalia stands at a corner of the Coronation Park on a plinth.King George V ruled until his death in January 1936, after which memorials were built and statues erected in various cities under the British Empire, the most notable among them being New Delhi—the administrative seat of a country that was held as the ‘Jewel in the Crown’.The ‘George V Memorial’ was planned next to the All-India War Memorial Arch (now called India Gate), and Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens, the chief architect of New Delhi, designed the canopy and the layout of the memorial, according to archival records and old books.The gently tall and exquisite statue, crafted out of white marble, was designed by famous British sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger and its models were exhibited in 1933 and 1935 at the Royal Academy, according to victorianweb.org, a scholarly resource.However, Jagger died in 1934 before he could complete his work, which was then completed by other artistes, it says.The statue of George V beneath the oriental-style canopy, endowed with royal motifs and surrounded by a pool of water, was unveiled by Viceroy of India Lord Linlinthgow on November 14, 1939, according to old documents and archives accessed by PTI.Born in 1865 in London, King George V was coronated as a king in 1910, and the next year, he travelled along with his consort Queen Mary to India to attend the famous 1911 Delhi Durbar, where he had also announced the shifting of the capital to Delhi from Calcutta.On December 15, 1911, the royal couple laid the foundation stone of the ‘new capital’ of the British Raj and the imperial city, which would later be christened ‘New Delhi’, was built over a period of nearly two decades. It was formally inaugurated in February 1931 by Viceroy Lord Irwin.“The King was everybody’s King. More particularly can we who are gathered here be sensible of this personal relationship with the Sovereign, who 28 years ago announced his decision to restore Delhi to its ancient birth right and who laid the first stones of his Imperial Capital,” as per the text of the Viceroy’s speech published in Indian Information publication in 1939.The famed canopy stands on four columns of the Delhi Order devised by Lutyens for the new capital’s main buildings sitting on the Raisina Hill complex radially opposite the India Gate on a long and wide axis called Rajpath (earlier Kingsway).The canopy will now house a grand statue of freedom fighter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, which will be installed at India Gate as a symbol of India’s “indebtedness” to him.Till the statue, made of granite, is completed, a hologram statue of his would be present at the same place.A section of historians and heritage activists, however, have lamented the “sudden transition” of “this sacred landscape”, and said, any change in this heritage precinct should have been done only after “due deliberations and proper public consultations”.Historian and author of “Connaught Place and the Making of New Delhi”, Swapna Liddle, feels, the canopy should have “remained empty” as a “symbol of the end of the Raj”.“Statues inspire curiosity, and with time can assume a controversial nature. And, while removal of George V’s statue was done in a nationalistic wave seen post-Independence, I feel the canopy should have been left unoccupied. No, one person only belongs there, there are too many heroes who made our free India. It’s not appropriate to install any single leader’s statue,” she said.Other historians also recalled the time in the late 80s when there was a proposal to install a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the vacated canopy, but it faced a lot of opposition, and eventually the planned statue was moved to Parliament House complex.Hashmi, who conducts heritage walks in the city, underlined that a project of such dramatic a scale, should have been done only after “proper and due consultations with the public, including experts and not suddenly announced, as if, it is some magic trick being performed”.“Bose is our great hero, and his statue could have been installed elsewhere in Delhi. But, to give him a space earlier occupied by a British ruler of India, and that too which was a memorial built after the king’s death, is not suitable by any stretch of imagination,” he argued.                                      #freedomfighter                                     #IndiaGate                                     #KingEdwardVII                                     #Netaji                                     #OldDelhi                                     #SubhasChandraBose||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bose-moved-to-edward-park-in-70s-now-his-new-statue-to-assume-king-george-canopy-363801

It’s part and parcel of who I am. My father had inculcated this interest in me. I have collection from across the globe and now have more than 1,350 Disney plush toys. I am the winner of the Limca book of records for the most number of Disney plush toys for an Indian.”She said that although the collection is priceless, many people, had asked her to sell the toys. A very renowned person had also offered her Rs 80 lakh for the same. However, she rejected him.The toys may fetch more than Rs 3 crore in the market as her collection is unique and is not owned by many collectors, according to Rizwana.She owns a limited edition full life-size toy of ‘Simba’ the Lion which is a unique piece as only 40 such pieces were produced. The Simba, which is 5 ft and 3 inches tall, adores her toy room.Rizwana said that all these toys are sold in Disneyland, Disneyworld, parks, stores, and toy shops and she had been collecting them for more than 25 years.When she was seven, her mother narrated her the story of Cinderella that hooked her to the world of Disney plush and turned her into an avid toy collector.She got most of her toys from her father who bought them for her on his business trips to the US, the UK, and various European countries.The avid collector said that her aim is to break into the Guinness World records and she has also started applying for the same.She said: “I don’t think there is anyone who has more than 1,350 Disney plush toys in their collection in the whole world and for that, I am applying to the Guinness... Let them verify and find out but I am confident that I will be having the maximum collection.”The 33-year-old investment banker said that she had passionately collected the Disney plush toys from wherever she could and may auction some of them soon to use the money raised for charity work.Rizwana’s great grandparents were from Afghanisthan but after her birth, her family settled in Thrissur. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/33-year-old-dubai-bizwoman-in-limca-book-of-records-for-maximum-disney-toys-363798

The stature of the rival political parties has already been reduced as a number of their leaders have joined the BJP.”“Whatever duties are assigned to me by the party, I will discharge them to the best of my ability. If the party asks me to campaign for SP chief Akhilesh ‘bhaiya’, then I will go to Karhal and seek votes for him,” he said.Singh said he decided to join the SP as the party does not discriminate against anyone and takes everyone along.Responding to a question about the SP having a pro-criminal image, Singh said, “If there are criminals and mafia elements in the SP, then you must specifically point them out. There are people who only spread rumours, and rumours should not be believed. Has there been any party under whose tenure there were no riots?” Asked if he will be contesting the assembly polls, Singh said it is for the SP president to decide.“As of now, I have just joined the party. As far as contesting the assembly elections is concerned, the decision in this regard will be taken by party chief Akhilesh ji. If he gives me a ticket, then I will definitely contest the elections,” he said.He added that if the party gives him a ticket, he will prefer to contest from the Pratapgarh assembly constituency.Singh on Saturday joined the SP in Lucknow in the presence of party president Akhilesh Yadav.The SP tweeted a photo in which Singh, dressed in a crisp white kurta-pyjama with a grey Nehru jacket on top, is seen standing with Yadav and other party leaders.Singh said he requires double the amount of fabric as compared to a normal person to get a kurta-pyjama stitched.“For a kurta, I need 4.5 to 5 metres of fabric. For a pyjama, I require around 4 metres of fabric,” he said.In a tweet in Hindi on Saturday, the SP said, “Expressing faith in the policies of the Samajwadi Party and the leadership of Shri Akhilesh Yadav, today Shri Dharmendra Pratap Singh of Pratapgarh joined the Samajwadi Party.”In a Facebook post, SP’s chief spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said, “We hope that with Dharmendra Pratap Singh (46), the tallest man of India joining the party, the SP will get strengthened.” PTI                                     #AkhileshYadav                                     #samajwadiparty                                     #Tallestman                                     #UPPolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-tallest-man-joins-samajwadi-party-hopes-to-dwarf-opponents-363787

23-01-2022||Kolkata||Netaji sent secret letter to Soviet leadership in 1939 asking for help in India's liberation||Amiya Bose, freedom icon Subhas Bose's nephew, was tasked by his uncle to carry a secret letter seeking Soviet help in India's liberation, which was to be delivered to agents in Britain in October 1939, barely a month into the Second World War.The freedom fighter's nephew, who was searched on landing in Britain by officers from New Scotland Yard, managed to smuggle in the letters – one of which was handed over to British Communist leader of Indian origin Rajani Palme Dutt and another to a Soviet agent."My father had recalled that his uncle had summoned him from Cambridge to India in May 1939 and was asked to go on a ‘Russian mission'. His father Sarat Bose was in the know but not his mother. He was asked to carry the messages in his overcoat pocket," said Madhuri Bose, the daughter of Amiya Bose and author of the book ‘The Bose Brothers', said in an interview to PTI.Amiya Bose had narrated to his daughter that he had told Subhas Bose, whose 125th birth anniversary is being celebrated Sunday, "If I get caught with your message, you would certainly be hanged." Bose had replied he would gladly take the risk.Subhas Bose, also called Netaji by millions of Indians, had held meetings with the Communist Party of India to enlist support in approaching the government of Soviet Russia. Madhuri Bose recalls that Soli Batlivala, who represented CPI at the meeting, agreed to this course of action.Batlivala in a hand-written record of the meeting given to Amiya Bose three decades later recounted that Netaji told him, "The strategy I suggest is: We in India launch a full-scale national movement for freedom; at the same time Soviet Russia marches from the North." Netaji apparently told Batlivala that "Soviet Russia could be trusted not to take advantage and occupy the country." CPI did not look upon the scheme with favour, according to the Kolkata-based communist, but agreed to see that the message reached Moscow.Accordingly, it was decided that Subhas Bose will send a direct communication through Amiya Bose. On arriving at UK's Poole port by seaplane, Amiya Bose was accosted by a New Scotland Yard officer who spoke perfect Bengali. He was interrogated for three hours and his luggage searched.His shaving kit and spare shoes were confiscated but amazingly his overcoat, in whose pockets the letters were kept, was not searched. Amiya Bose later recounted that his uncle clearly had "a good understanding of the minds of intelligence officers".Amiya Bose contacted Rajni Palme Dutt, then secretary of the British Communist party and member of the Comintern, and gave him one of the letters. Palme Dutt in turn organized a rendezvous for Amiya Bose with a Soviet agent in a Bristol Hotel where the second letter addressed to the Soviet leadership was handed over."There was no reply from the Soviet Union to Subhas Bose's letter. My father used to say that someday that letter will turn up when Soviet archives are truly revealed," Madhuri Bose said.Subhas Bose, who was later jailed by the British and kept under house arrest, escaped from British vigilance and made his way in 1941 to Germany via Afghanistan and Soviet Russia, using an Italian passport in the name of Count Orlando Mazzotta.After founding the Indian legion in Germany from Indian prisoners of war, he finally made his way to Japan to form the Indian National Army to try and militarily free India.                                      #NetajiSubhasBose||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/netaji-sent-secret-letter-to-soviet-leadership-in-1939-asking-for-help-in-indias-liberation-363778

The merger took place during a brief ceremony on Friday.While some military officials defended the decision to merge the flame, several opposition parties, including the Congress accused the BJP-ruled Centre of "removing history".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-dropped-abide-with-me-from-beating-retreat-as-indian-tunes-more-appropriate-sources-363767

She urged the voters to ignore the Congress because its role in the Uttar Pradesh election is that that of a“kill-joy”.She slammed Priyanka for backing out from her own self projection as the chief ministerial face of the party.Political pundits are of the view thatMayawati's jibe at Priyanka was a payback in kind for the latter recentlyraising doubts on Mayawati keepinga low profile vis-a-vis the election affairs in Uttar Pradesh for the past few months.Gandhi had reportedly said that it was possible that the BJP government was exerting pressure on Mayawati.This is perhaps the first timethe two senior women politicians have exchanged barbs.While the Congress through Gandhi has embarked on winning over women voters through ‘Mein ladki hun, lad sakti hun’ to revive and shore up the party in the state, Mayawati is on a mission to dispel any notion of her dwindling influence among the Dalits, Muslims and others caste groups.There were questions in some quarters on her popularity in the backdrop of the exodus of senior leaders from the BSP.Mayawati’s dig at Gandhi becomes stark in the context of the latter backing out from her earlier assertion that she was the only Congress face in the polls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mayawati-takes-a-jibe-at-priyanka-gandhi-hits-out-at-congress-363757

BA.2 lineage is in a substantial fraction in India and S gene dropout based screening is thus likely to give high false negatives," it said.S-gene dropout is a genetic variation like that of omicron."The recently reported B.1.640.2 lineage is being monitored. There is no evidence of rapid spread and while it has features of immune escape, it is currently not a variant of concern. So far, no case has been detected in India," the INSACOG said.The INSACOG, in its bulletin of January 3 which was also released on Sunday, also said omicron is now in community transmission in India and has become dominant in Delhi and Mumbai where new cases have been rising exponentially."Further spread of omicron in India is now expected to be through internal transmission, not foreign travellers, and a revised sampling and sequencing strategy of INSACOG is being worked out to address genomic surveillance objectives in the wake of dynamic changing scenario of virus infection," the INSACOG said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/omicron-in-community-transmission-stage-in-india-dominant-in-multiple-metros-insacog-363755

Minimum temperatures have been close to and above normal.This is largely due to clouds and rain preventing long exposure to sunshine between January 9 and January 19, said Mahest Palawat, vice president (Meteorology and Climate Change), Skymet Weather, said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-88-2-mm-delhi-logs-highest-january-rainfall-since-1950-363749

They reached the office at 8.55 and questioning commenced under the leadership of Crime Branch Superintendent of Police C. Mohanachandran.Popular because of the comic characters he plays on screen, Dilip has been in the news for the wrong reasons after a frontline South Indian heroine complained that she had been abducted and sexually assaulted by a gang of goons in 2017 and certain scenes were filmed to blackmail her.After the main accused Sunil was arrested and questioned, the prosecution charged Dileep with being the main conspirator in the case. Dileep was arrested and jailed. He spent two months in prison before getting bail and the trial has been going on.Recently, a former close associate of Dileep, Balachandrakumar, a movie director who had fallen out with the actor, revealed that Dileep had conspired to do away with the investigating officers in the case.He alleged that Dileep, while watching a YouTube video of the then Superintendent of Police A.V.  George had spoken openly about doing away with the officer and engaging rowdy elements for this. Dileep's accomplices, according to the film director's version of the conversation, had said that they would have to spend Rs 1.5 crore for this.Balachandrakumar made the deposition before a magistrate's court along with a few audio recordings he had made at Dileep's residence.The police officers who Dileep had allegedly said that he would do away with included DGP B. Sandhya, ADGP S. Sreejith, SPs A.V. George and S. Sudarshan, and Deputy SP Byju Paulose.Balachandrakumar also revealed that Dileep had said he would cut and remove the right hand of SP Sudarshan, who he said had assaulted him while he was in police custody.

23-01-2022||---||Poll season and party hopping: Why self-gain is the ideology of choice||Renu Sud SinhaTHE findings of a report by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) on candidates who switched parties and recontested from 2014 to 2021 are both insightful and eye-opening. Based on the election affidavits of 500 MLAs and MPs, the BJP, as expected, emerged as the biggest gainer, with 173 joining the party. The Congress was the biggest loser, with 177 defecting.The defections, the report noted, led to governments in Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Goa, Arunachal Pradesh and Karnataka falling, blaming it on the nexus of money and muscle power, and absence of laws on the functioning of parties. “It will be a mockery of democracy if we fail to plug these loopholes,” the report released in September last year concluded, adding that it is high time “our parties and politicians put an end to the politics of convenience and self-gain, and start practising politics of conviction, courage and consensus”.However, parties think that they are above law, says Jagdeep Chhokar, co-founder, ADR. This is quite evident in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur, where party hopping remains the most dominant election activity ahead of the polls beginning next month.A lawyer by profession, Chhokar favours a “comprehensive and strict law governing the functioning of parties that can have checks and balances to take care of many existing loopholes”. Till such a law comes into existence, he says, the free run of hopping parties will continue.Maj Gen Anil Verma (retd), national coordinator and head, ADR, calls it a sad state of affairs. “The parties have been defying orders of the Election Commission of India (EC) and the Supreme Court on poll-related issues.”He suggests a three-pronged strategy — a strict and proactive judiciary, a vigilant EC and an informed voter. “I don’t have much hope from the voters because they do fall prey to caste, creed, religion, and freebies. The electorate also does not understand the gravity of electing representatives with criminal background. The only solution left is voter education for ethical and informative voting.”The EC and judiciary, he says, have been acting lenient for reasons best known to them. “Both should take stern measures. The present penalty by the SC on defectors (post-election) is quite low — between Rs1 lakh and Rs5 lakh. It should be increased to a few crores to at least cover the cost of conducting elections.”The EC, says Maj Gen Verma, may not have much power such as de-registering parties which encourage hoppers, or freezing their symbol, but Article 324 does give it some freedom to resolve issues plaguing the electoral system, “which the EC has not been using pro-actively”. The anti-defection law, too, needs to be amended, he says, “but lawmakers are these politicians only and they are, obviously, not keen on doing it”.“Switching parties has always been a part of both pre and post-poll scenario. However, this time, most parties seem to have become dharamshalas with no doors,” says Dr Pramod Kumar of the Institute for Development and Communication (IDC), Chandigarh.Balwinder Singh Laddi, Congress MLA from Sri Hargobindpur in Gurdaspur district, seems to prove this point. Miffed at not getting the party ticket, he, along with sitting Congress MLA Fateh Singh Bajwa and former minister Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi walked across the saffron line. Laddi was back in his parent party in less than a week, calling it an “emotional decision to go to the BJP”. However, even his apologies to the Congress have not earned him a ticket.A veteran politician of over 50 years, Bir Devinder Singh, who has himself switched parties, calls it the downside of the anti-defection law that penalises only individual legislators switching parties after the election. “Politics nowadays is completely devoid of values. There is no commitment to ideology by anyone anymore, neither by the individuals switching sides or by parties who welcome such turncoats into their parties,” says the former Punjab Vidhan Sabha Deputy Speaker.Dr Kumar feels blurred ideological boundaries have made this mobility easy as well as fast.Come one, come allDespite assertions by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal of not accepting ‘kachra’ from any party in Punjab, AAP has been on a major induction spree, ‘welcoming’ leaders from the Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and rewarding them with tickets, even at the cost of causing resentment among its own committed cadre.However, of all the 117 names already announced, the party claims only 20 per cent of its nominees are ‘migrants’. Thirteen had joined AAP only a few days ago.Some of the major names from the Congress that have been given the ticket include Sukhjinder Singh Lalli (Majitha), Raman Bahl (Gurdaspur), Ranjit Singh Rana (Bholath), Raman Arora (Jalandhar Central), Jagroop Singh Gill (Bathinda Urban) and Joginder Singh Mann (Phagwara).Even many veterans with deep roots in SAD have given in to the allure of power. Traditional Panthic leader and former minister Surjit Singh Kohli, with over seven decades’ association with the Akali Dal, has switched allegiance to AAP, along with son Ajit Pal Singh Kohli, a former Patiala mayor and now the party’s nominee from there. Other prominent names include real estate baron Kulwant Singh, who has been given a ticket from Mohali, and former SAD minister Sewa Singh Sekhwan’s son Jagrup Singh Sekhwan, who is contesting from Qadian (Gurdaspur).In this season of defections, AAP has seen some losses as well — the most curious case being that of Ashu Banger, the party’s nominee from Ferozepur Rural. This is perhaps the first time that a candidate has switched sides even after getting the ticket, the denial of which is otherwise the usual factor for deserting any party. While AAP leader Harpal Cheema alleges coercion on part of the Congress, Banger denies the charge, saying he will soon reveal the reality.Prof Jagroop Singh Sekhon, former professor of political science at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, calls it an era of ideology-less politics. “Power remains the sole aim and getting the ticket the only end with all kinds of means justified to get it.”The only agenda most political parties have is to win the elections at any cost, adds Dr Kumar.From 23 to 65When the BJP and SAD parted ways in Punjab and with the backlash generated by the farmers’ protest, the BJP, the buzz was, would find it difficult to even field 117 candidates. Today, with new partners in Capt Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa’s SAD (Sanyukt), the BJP has forced the Congress to delay releasing the second list, lest the sulking leaders who are denied the ticket switch over to the saffron party.A defender in other four poll-bound states, this is the first time the BJP is contesting on its own in Punjab, at around 65 seats from a mere 23 earlier. In an effort to play down its Hindutva image and gain a foothold in the state, it is accommodating prominent Sikh leaders from the Congress and SAD.Apart from Congress’ Bajwa, Sodhi, Dhaliwal, Harjot Kamal, Akali leaders Jagdeep Singh Nakai, Gurtej Singh Ghuriana, Sarabjit Singh Makkar and Manjinder Singh Sirsa have joined the BJP. The party has also managed to rope in Akali stalwart Gurcharan Singh Tohra’s grandson Kanwarveer Singh (Amloh). In its first list released on Friday, out of 35 candidates, 13 are Sikhs.The party is serving an inclusive platter of nominees, including Brahmins, Khatris, Baniyas, SCs and farmers. Notable inclusions in the first list are recent entrants from the Congress — Nimisha Mehta (Garshankar), a close associate of CM Channi, and Arvind Khanna (Sangrur), a relative of former Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh.Most significantly, one-third of these 35 nominees are recent entrants from the SAD and the BJP.But as candidates change parties at their convenience, how do they justify it to those whom they represent — their voters?Prof Sekhon says the traditional voter is not going anywhere and will vote according to caste. Populism should take care of others, adds Dr Kumar. “This is evident from freebies offered in manifestoes, rather ‘menufestoes’. With at least five parties in the ring, competitive bribing is the new norm,” he rues.“The protest movement against farm laws had brought in some accountability, with leaders strongly telling farmers not to vote for a particular party. Their becoming stakeholders now will only add to the problem,” feels Prof Sekhon.From promises of money, free atta-dal to jobs, the parties are offering need-based sops. Surinder Rai (33), an unemployed professional from Ferozepur, remains hopeful of AAP’s promises of employment, not affected by the Banger episode.For Sirhind-based Anmol Bali, the sitting Congress MLA from Fatehgarh Sahib Kuljit Nagra’s past performance is the deciding voting factor. Banger, too, is certain of his win despite the last-minute switch. “I have worked hard in my constituency, sometimes even 18 hours at a stretch. My voters and supporters know this.”With elections in the state being deferred by a week, February 1 is now the last date to file nominations. The season of defections has just got extended.Reverse migration in UPThe BJP may have emerged as a major poacher in Punjab, but in Uttar Pradesh, it is the Yogi Adityanath government that has been facing the heat.Three ministers — Swami Prasad Maurya, Dara Singh Chauhan and Dharam Singh Saini — and MLAs Bhagwati Sagar, Roshan Lal Verma, Brijesh Prajapati, Vinay Shakya, Mukesh Verma and Bala Awasthi have gone to the Samajwadi Party (SP), which has emerged as the saffron party’s main Opposition.Another BJP MLA, Avatar Singh Bhadana, has joined the RLD. Two Apna Dal MLAs have also quit.“Maurya claimed he and other OBC leaders were feeling alienated in the Thakur-dominated administration. Akhilesh Yadav is actively courting such leaders as he wants to remove the Yadav tag from his party and consolidate the non-Yadav OBC vote, which these leaders should bring,” says a Lucknow-based veteran journalist.“Mulayam’s daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav and two more relatives, Hari Om Yadav and Pramod Gupta, joining the BJP is a mere face-saving for the party, as they hardly bring anything to the table,” he adds.The saffron party was also able to induct Priyanka Maurya, Congress’ poster girl of “Ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon” campaign.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/features/poll-season-and-party-hopping-why-self-gain-is-the-ideology-of-choice-363714

At the Beating the Retreat, Massed Bands of the forces played this tune at the fag-end of the ceremony conducted each year at Vijay Chowk.As per the programme schedule released by the Ministry of Defence, the Massed Bands will play three tunes to end the ceremony.

Between the lines, we cannot turn a blind eye to behaviour which would threaten the respect for international law. That’s why the presence (of German warship Bayern) is documentation that we are in favour of a rules-based international community,” German Ambassador Walter Lindner said here on Saturday.The German envoy was speaking at a virtual media interaction along with Commander Tilo Kalski, Commanding Officer of the frigate Bayern, which was denied permission to dock in Shanghai despite Berlin’s protestations that its showing up in South China Sea was more symbolic than military.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-ignore-disrespect-for-global-norms-german-envoy-363581

According to sources, the SSM had moved an application for registration as a political party on January 8. In response, the EC had sent a letter to the SSM on January 18 with various objections, including submitting income tax returns for just one year, instead of three. Besides the address proof of the party’s registered office submitted by the SSM was not found as per the norms. The EC also objected to several columns being left blank in the registration form.Sources said the development had left the SSM leadership confused. One of the options being considered now is to contest the elections on the symbol of another political party, possibly a dormant political outfit, already registered with the EC.Prem Singh Bhangu, a member of SSM’s parliamentary board, said: “We are trying to resolve the registration issue before the deadline for the filing of nomination papers. If it is not resolved by then, we will explore the possibility of getting a common symbol.” After the success of the farmers’ agitation, a large section of the SKM had formed the political outfit to contest the elections.                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ssm-in-soup-ec-raises-objections-363562

PTIVisiting Sadhu Sweet shop, whose owner Rakesh Garg migrated to Ambala after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and returned later, and another affected local family of Mittals, Shah said residents told him they no longer lived in the shadow of fear.BJP’s star campaigner, who visited Kairana for the first time today since 2014, said he was elated at the scale of transformation in the area, especially the atmosphere of peace, with people saying those who forced others to migrate were themselves fleeing UP now.Shah gave slogan “Abki baar 300 paar”. The BJP has fielded its late Kairana MP Hukum Singh’s daughter Mriganka from the seat, while SP candidate is Iqra Hasan. Iqra is the sister of SP’s sitting Kairana MLA Nahid Hassan, who the party had fielded first. A change was necessitated after Nahid Hassan’s recent arrest under the Gangster Act.

The bitter truth is that Punjab’s debt is increasing every subsequent year. The state’s outstanding debt has increased to Rs 77,000 crore, with Rs 30,000 crore accumulating in the present financial year itself,” the PIL pointed out.“Political parties are prioritising their self-interest over national interest and the public fund, which should have been properly utilised to secure fundamental rights of citizens, is being used to lure voters,” Upadhyay said, urging the top court to direct the Election Commission to seize election symbols and deregister political parties that promised to distribute irrational freebies to voters from public funds. —                                     #AssemblyPoll2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/declare-irrational-poll-freebies-unconstitutional-plea-in-sc-363566
