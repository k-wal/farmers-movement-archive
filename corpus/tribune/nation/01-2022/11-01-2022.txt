11-01-2022||---||Suspension of BJP MLAs from Maharashtra Assembly ‘worse than expulsion’: SC||New Delhi, January 11Terming the suspension of 12 BJP MLAs from Maharashtra Legislative Assembly for a year as “worse than expulsion”, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said it created a constitutional void as the constituencies concerned remained unrepresented in the House.“We will accept the arguments of Mr (Siddharth) Bhatnagar that this decision is worse than expulsion. This suspension for one year is worse than expulsion. The consequences are so dreadful,” a Bench led by Justice A M Khanwilkar said, endorsing the argument of the counsel representing some of the petitioners.Noting that there was a statutory obligation to fill in a seat within six months, the Bench said, “You can’t create a constitutional void…a hiatus situation for the constituency. And, it is one constituency or 12 constituencies, makes no difference. Each constituency has an equal right to be represented in the House.”The House has power to suspend a member but not for a period of beyond 59 days, the top court said while hearing petitions filed by 12 BJP MLAs against their one-year suspension from the assembly for allegedly misbehaving with the presiding officer.The one-year suspension was not about punishing the member, but the constituency as a whole, it noted.Twelve BJP MLAs were suspended from the Assembly for a year after the Maharashtra Government accused them of misbehaving with Presiding Officer Bhaskar Jadhav in the Speaker’s chamber on the first day of the monsoon session on July 5 last year.The suspended BJP MLAs are Dr. Sanjay Kute, Ashish Shelar, Abhimanyu Pawar, Girish Mahajan, Atul Bhatkhalkar, Harish Pimple, Jaikumar Rawal, Yogesh Sagar, Narayan Kuche, Bunty Bhangdiya, Parag Alvani and Ram Satpute.Referring to Article 190 (4) of the Constitution, it said if for a period of 60 days, a member of a House, without its permission, was absent from all meeting, the House may declare his or her seat vacant.“In the facts of the present case, we will say enough is enough in two pages. We don’t have to elaborate much about this case,” it said.The Bench posted the matter for further hearing on January 18 after Maharashtra counsel said he would get back to the court.The Supreme Court had on December 14 issued notice to the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly on BJP MLAs’ petition challenging their suspension from the House for a year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/suspension-of-bjp-mlas-from-maharashtra-assembly-worse-than-expulsion-sc-360373

11-01-2022||New Delhi||India’s fuel consumption shows almost no growth in December||India’s fuel consumption showed flattish growth in December 2021 ahead of fresh restrictions kicking in to control the surge of a new variant of coronavirus that is likely to further dampen demand, according to official data released on Tuesday.Total petroleum product consumption in December 2021 stood at 18.43 million tonnes, compared with 18.36 million tonnes in the same month last year. This after a rise in demand for transport fuel was negated by a fall in industrial fuel.The consumption was 7.6 per cent higher month-on-month but was still 2.7 per cent lower than pre-COVID-19 levels of 2019, according to the data released by the oil ministry’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC).As the economy continued to rebound from the deep impact of the second wave, transport fuel demand rose in December.Diesel, the most used fuel in the country accounting for almost 40 per cent of all petroleum product consumption, rose 1.5 per cent year-on-year to 7.305 million tonnes and was near pre-COVID-19 demand of 7.387 million tonnes in December 2019.Petrol sales, which crossed the pre-COVID-19 level a few months ago, climbed four per cent to 2.81 million tonnes in December 2021. The demand for fuel, most used in cars and two-wheelers, stood at 2.47 million tonnes in December 2019.Increased travel during the holiday season is said to have contributed to the rise.With increased air travel, aviation turbine fuel (ATF) posted a 29 per cent growth in consumption to 5,52,000 tonnes but it was lower than 7,29,000 tonnes           Cooking gas LPG consumption fell almost two per cent to 2.4 million tonnes. This is largely because consumption in December 2020 was higher on the back of the free cylinders that the government gave to the poor to tide over the hardships of the pandemic.Yet, the demand in December 2020 was higher than the pre-COVID-19 level as LPG sales in December 2019 was 2.35 million tonnes, the data showed.Consumption of naphtha, which is used as a fuel in industries, fell two per cent to 1.18 million tonnes, while petcoke demand fell 14.8 per cent. The sale of bitumen, used in road construction, was down 19 per cent to 6,95,000 tonnes. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-fuel-consumption-shows-almost-no-growth-in-december-360353
11-01-2022||Vibha Sharma||UP polls: BJP gets its act ready with first list of candidates around Makar Sakranti||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 11The ruling BJP, which on Monday set the process of finalising candidates for the crucial Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, is expected to announce the first list around Makar Sakranti.However, despite her “declining vote share”, there is an eager wait for BSP supremo Mayawati to reveal her hand.The BSP is expected to field “quite a few Muslims” in UP, especially in the regions directly influenced by the second largest religious bloc in the state. Any situation like this will only work to the advantage of the BJP as most of the opposition, including its chief rival Samajwadi Party, the Congress, and the AIMIM, are also eyeing this crucial vote bloc. The BSP has “finalised” names on the majority of seats and also “intimated the selected candidates”, according to sources.  The BJP, which held the meeting of its state election committee yesterday, held discussions on the first three phases, which includes regions like the western UP, Rohilkhand, Braj and Yadav dominated belt of Etawah, Mainpuri and Bundelkhand. The sources said the state unit sifted the feedback received from the grass-root level and forwarded it to the central leadership for final approval.Though the BJP wants to announce the majority of names as soon as possible, there are some seats on which it needs to tread cautiously, especially the ones where key rival Samajwadi Party has an upper hand. This is where the BSP and its vote share come in.The BSP has not allied with any party and is contesting all the 403 seats alone. With a “declining” vote share projection, it is projected to win only around eight to 16 seats only. However, with a dedicated vote share it has the potential to spoil the chances of many.   While in 2007 the minority community voted largely for the BSP and for the SP in 2012, in the last elections its votes got split amongst the SP-Congress combine, the BSP and the Peace Party to the advantage of the BJP. The Muslims are the second-largest religious bloc and constitute around 20 per cent of the population and this time around Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM is also in the contention.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-polls-bjp-gets-its-act-ready-with-first-list-of-candidates-around-makar-sakranti-360347

There is a need to oust BJP from power there,” he said.The NCP chief said his party will contest ensuing elections in Uttar Pradesh, Manipur and Goa.“BJP would like to contest the elections on communal lines but I am confident that the voters will not accept it,” Pawar said.On claims of security lapse during of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Punjab visit, Pawar said, “The post of prime minister is an institution and security is the responsibility of the Centre and the state and necessary care needs to be taken.” On Uttar Pradesh minister Swami Prasad Maurya quitting the state cabinet to join Samajwadi Party, Pawar said, “Every day some new faces will ‘migrate’ in the run up to the voting.” The NCP chief said he will participate in a meeting called by Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav.There will be change in Uttar Pradesh, Pawar said, speaking on the fate of the Adityanath government in the north Indian state. “People need change,” he added.Pawar slammed Yogi Adityanath over the latter’s “80:20” remarks. Adityanath has called the UP election an “80 versus 20 battle”, in a highly controversial comment seen to imply a religious divide. The numbers citied by him roughly correspond to the ratio of Hindus to Muslims in UP.NCP will contest five seats in Manipur with Congress, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/talks-on-with-like-minded-parties-to-fight-bjp-in-goa-sharad-pawar-360341

This is in effect a violation of her right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and forces her to relive the trauma that she experienced as a refugee in her own country.The petition contended that on December 14, the petitioner’s cousin Sahil Tikoo had a discussion in a Twitter space wherein he was called an Indian agent, and a lot of other allegations were made against him.On December 15, tagging the Home Minister Office’s handle on Twitter, Aarti Tikoo - founder and editor of ‘The New Indian’ - had posted a tweet which read: “My brother @TikooSahil_ who lives in Srinagar, is being openly threatened by jihadi terrorists sitting in Kashmir-India, and their handlers in Pakistan, UK and US. Is anyone watching? Are we sitting ducks waiting to be shot dead by Islamists or will you crackdown on them?”.Her plea stated that it is clear that the arbitrary action of Respondent No.2 in suspending the account of the Petitioner for merely calling out radical Islamism is something that deserves to be censured and quashed.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-notice-on-scribe-aarti-tikoos-plea-against-twitters-decision-to-lock-her-account-360327

11-01-2022||New Delhi||Classic fun comic Tintin turns 93||Tintin has turned 93!On January 10, 1929, Le Petit Vingtième (French for ‘The Little Twentieth’) the weekly youth supplement of the newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle (The Twentieth Century) published from Brussels first began publishing a comic strip featuring a young man with a tuft of hair and his companion, Snowy, a Fox Terrier. The creator of the strip was Georges Prosper Remi, who went under the pen name Hergé (1907-1983). This was “Tintin in the Land of the Soviets”.The rest, as they say, is history.In the first book, Tintin seems to count more on brawn than brain. The sketches too lacked the beauty that one sees in Herge’s later works. Tintin, introduced by Herge as a reporter, next visits Congo and then America. While in Congo (Tintin in Congo 1931) Tintin betrays some of the prejudices prevalent among the white folks at that time (“In the portrayal of Belgian Congo the young Herge reflects the colonial attitudes of the times”, noted the publisher in a recent issue of the book), in Tintin in America (1932), Herge made no bone about his sympathy for the native Americans.Tintin stories set in South America (Tintin and the Picaros, The Broken Ear) reaffirm the stereotype of the countries in this region being “Banana Republics”. However, “Prisoners of the Sun” (1948) does show how roughly the indigenous folk of the region were treated by the descendents of the Europeans who had migrated to South America after the discovery of the “New World”.India features in three of Tintin stories. In the book “Cigars of the Pharao” (1934), Tintin’s plane crashes in the jungle. He then runs into a sick elephant. Tintin cures the elephant who then transports him to safety. Besides befriending the elephant, Tintin also experiences other aspects of the Indian exotica during his adventure in the country. He runs into a friendly Maharaja, meets a mendicant who prefers a bed of nails for seating rather than a cushioned chair.In Blue Lotus (1936), Tintin heads for China from India. Tintin last came to India en route Tibet (Tintin in Tibet, 1960). Tintin and his friend Captain Haddock land in Delhi and see the Red Fort and Qutab Minar. Haddock gets a dressing down from a labourer for bumping into him . Interestingly, the angry remarks of the labourer made in Hindi were written in the book in Devanagari script .Bengali children’s magazine “Anandamela”, brought out by the Kolkata-headquartered media behemoth ABP Group, first translated Tintin into an Indian language in the mid-1970s. It was an instant hit. According to the memoir written by Badal Basu, publisher of the ABP Group, Satyajit Ray, the legendary filmmaker, had suggested Aveek Sarkar, proprietor of the ABP Group, to translate and publish Tintin comics in Bengali. Tintin has been hugely popular in Bengal.Joy Bhattacharjya, former team director of Kolkata Knight Riders, was among the first to post a message on twitter to remind those following him that it was Tintin’s 93rd b’day.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tintin-turns-93-360283

At that time, the two leaders laid out their shared vision for US-India relationship and (we) will continue to work closely this year,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference.“You can expect our governments will be moving forward on a wide-ranging set of initiatives from cooperating to fight the pandemic, scaling up action to address climate change, working bilaterally and through the QUAD (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue), expand our cooperation in trade and investment, cyber, and in new and emerging technologies,” Psaki said.She was responding to questions on the agenda of the Biden administration with regard to the India-US relationship in 2022.“And continuing to talk about as always, we are focused on strengthening the deep ties between our people and our shared democratic values that underpin the relationship. But obviously, we're going to continue to build from here,” Psaki said.In response to another question on China's aggressive behaviour on the border with India, she said the United States continues to monitor the situation.“We continue to closely monitor the situation. We continue to support dialogue and peaceful resolution of these border disputes. We've been pretty clear how we view Beijing's behaviour in the region around the world.

11-01-2022||Aditi Tandon||Weeks ahead of elections, Goa minister, legislator quit BJP||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 10Less than a month to go for the Goa elections scheduled for February 14, minister Michael Lobo and BJP legislator Pravin Zantye on Monday resigned from the party and the legislative Assembly hinting at parleys with the Congress.Congress ex-MLA Masood joins SPFormer Congress MLA Imran Masood, along with his supporters, joined the SP on Monday. “The SP is the only party that can challenge the BJP in Uttar Pradesh. I have said from Day one that I will work to defeat the BJP,” he said. TNSMoments after the two resigned, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said a few defections here and there could not undermine the BJP in the state. “The BJP is a big family that continues to serve the motherland with full devotion. A few defections to fulfil the agenda of greed and personal interests cannot deter our agenda of good governance. Goan people have seen BJP’s governance and development model for a decade and I am sure that they will give us another term in their service. Jai Hind, Jai Goa,” Sawant tweeted with Goa BJP chief Sadanand Tanavade too underplaying Lobo’s exit as just another “opportunistic defection”.Lobo, an MLA from the Calangute Assembly segment, was the Goa port and waste management minister. Earlier today, he tendered a resignation to the CMO and the Goa Assembly Speaker.Asked about the future plans, Lobo said he was in talks with other political parties. “The people of Goa are extremely disenchanted with the BJP. Voters have told me that the BJP is no more a party of commoners. Grass-roots workers have been sidelined,” said Lobo.Zantye, who represents the Mayem segment in the state Assembly, also resigned citing lack of appreciation for grounded workers in the BJP.He said he had joined the BJP on the insistence of late Union Minister Manohar Parrikar. “After his demise, I have felt progressively sidelined in the party,” said Zantye.The two are likely to join the Congress which has so far announced 15 candidates for the 40-member Goa Assembly, and has announced a pre-poll alliance with the Goa Forward Party led by Vijay Sardesai.Sardesai, former deputy CM in Goa, had quit the BJP government in July 2019 after being dropped from the Cabinet along with two supporters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/weeks-ahead-of-elections-goa-minister-legislator-quit-bjp-360153

This is yet another example of his attention to minute details and his concern for the poor.”Modi had last month inaugurated the first phase of the dham, which has massively expanded the Kashi Vishwanath Temple premises and beautified the complex. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jute-footwear-pms-gift-for-kashi-workers-360155

11-01-2022||Satya Prakash||Former SC judge to probe PM Modi's security lapse in Punjab||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 10The Supreme Court on Monday ordered setting up a high-level committee headed by a former judge of the top court to probe the security lapse during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Punjab last week.Centre’s notice self-contradictoryYour show-cause notice is self-contradictory. By constituting the committee, you seek to inquire if there is a breach of the SPG Act and then you hold state Chief Secretary and DGP guilty.... Who held them guilty? — CJI-led BenchCommittee to submit report at earliestA three-judge Bench led by CJI NV Ramana ordered the inquiry committees of the Centre and the Punjab Government to halt their respective probe into the January 5 security lapse.“We are taking the PM’s security breach very seriously,” said the Bench, which also included Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli.The committee led by a retired Supreme Court judge will include the Chandigarh Police chief, National Investigation Agency IG, Punjab and Haryana High Court Registrar General and the Punjab ADGP (Security), the top court said, adding that a detailed order would be released later.The committee will submit its report to the top court at the earliest, it said. Once the committee submits its report, the top court will pass orders for action to be taken by the Centre and the Punjab Government. The order came after the Punjab Government demanded an independent probe into the breach in the Prime Minister’s security, saying the state would not get a fair hearing in any probe carried out by the Centre.Just before the crucial hearing, many Advocates-on-Record (through whom cases are filed in the Supreme Court) allegedly received calls from an anonymous number from the UK taking responsibility for the security breach at Hussainiwala flyover.The Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA) has written to the Supreme Court Secretary General (with a copy to Delhi Police Chief), demanding immediate action against those responsible for it.According to the SCAORA letter, the caller also threatened the Supreme Court judges, asking them to refrain from hearing the PIL as “the court had not been able to punish the culprits of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots”.During the hearing on a petition filed by an NGO, Lawyer’s Voice, seeking a probe into the security lapse, Punjab Advocate General DS Patwalia took strong exception to the seven show-cause notices issued to the SSP concerned, Chief Secretary and senior officials of the state, asking them to explain why action should not be taken against them. The petitioners wanted the court to fix responsibility of the Punjab Chief Secretary and the state’s DGP, place them under suspension and direct the Centre to initiate departmental action against them.Alleging that “there is some politics behind it”, Patwalia said, “I will not get a fair hearing from the Central Government. Please appoint an independent committee, and give us a fair hearing....”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta clarified that the show-cause notices were issued before the court’s order. “If you have already made up your mind then what’s the need for having an inquiry.... There’s a lapse and it has to be found out who is responsible for it,” the Bench said.“Your show-cause notice is totally self-contradictory. By constituting the committee, you seek to inquire if there is a breach of the SPG Act and then you hold the state Chief Secretary and the DGP guilty. Who held them guilty?” it wondered. The Solicitor General said these were only show-cause notices and not findings. Noting that it was an issue of the security of the PM, Mehta said it could be examined by senior officials of the Central Government. The report could be placed before the Bench and then “Your Lordships can take an appropriate decision,” Mehta said.Patwalia objected to it and reiterated his demand for an independent probe. Finally, the top court ordered setting up a committee headed by a former judge of the Supreme Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-sc-judge-to-probe-pms-security-lapse-360136

With the district logging 344 fresh cases, the active Covid caseload increased to 1,622.Better prepared this time: Health Ministry151 cr vaccine doses administeredSources cited Covid surge worldwide (the US reporting nearly 8 lakh cases a day, France 3 lakh, UK 2 lakh) to say that India is “bound to cross 4.40 lakh daily cases but there is no cause for panic as preparation this time is two to three times better as compared to 2021”. Omicron infection has so far not taken a severe form in India. Of the 4,031 cases as of today, 40 per cent (1,552) have recovered.Hospitalisation rate during the current surge is between 5 and 10 per cent as against 20 to 23 per cent during the second wave, and a majority of the cases show the potential of treatment through home isolation.“In the present surge, 5 to 10 per cent of the active cases have needed hospitalisation, but the situation is evolving. Therefore the need for hospitalisation may also change rapidly,” Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a letter to states and UTs today.Bhushan also asked states and UTs to earmark private hospital beds for Covid care and create mechanisms to ensure private facilities do not overcharge patients.The Health Secretary’s letter was issued on a day when Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya reviewed Covid status with state health ministers. Although largely mild (hospitalisation rate is one-fourth of the second wave), the current surge can’t be taken lightly because the sheer volume of case numbers can overwhelm the health system, the Health Ministry said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/5-10-cases-require-hospitalisation-govt-360142

Even as the war-torn country is reeling under a social, political and economic crisis, the 45-odd Afghan embassies and 20 consulates around the world have steadfastly refused to kowtow to the Taliban despite being deprived of funds and pushed to the brink.Blames Pak for Afghanistan’s woesThe Pakistani establishment has been acting as an evil force. Its leadership has failed to behave reasonably and responsibly, imperilling peace in the subcontinent and beyond. Farid Mamundzay, afghan envoy to india“We are not answerable to the Taliban. Our job is to keep helping students and other Afghan nationals hit hard by the upheaval. We are hopeful that an inclusive government that represents the people of Afghanistan will be formed sooner or later,” says Farid Mamundzay, who continues to function as the Afghan envoy to India, even though the Ashraf Ghani dispensation that had appointed him collapsed in August last year.Mamundzay, who is on a week-long trip to Punjab and other parts of the region, says the Taliban would have to respect democratic values and mend their ways to stand any chance of being part of a representative government, which holds the key to peace and stability in Afghanistan. “The Taliban should realise that it’s only legitimacy at home that can pave the way for legitimacy in the global arena,” he asserts.The envoy minces no words in blaming Pakistan for Afghanistan’s present woes. “The Pakistani establishment has been acting as an evil force. Its leadership has failed to behave reasonably and responsibly, imperilling peace in the subcontinent and beyond,” he says. It’s at the Afghan embassy in Islamabad that the Taliban have managed to get their hand-picked diplomats posted.Lauding India for providing aid to Afghanistan in the form of life-saving medicines and Covid vaccines, Mamundzay laments that Pakistan has been dragging its feet on land transit for New Delhi’s 50,000-tonne wheat consignment meant for Kabul.“Foodgrain shortage has acquired alarming proportions in Afghanistan.
