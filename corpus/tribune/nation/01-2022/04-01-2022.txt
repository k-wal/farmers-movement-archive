04-01-2022||---||Justice R Subhash Reddy favours creating Courts of Appeal||New Delhi, January 4Justice R Subhash Reddy – who retired as a Supreme Court judge on Tuesday after a stint of more than three years – favoured creating Courts of Appeal to hear appeals arising out of orders passed by high courts.”I remember very recently AG (Attorney General) suggested a further court of appeal above high courts which can be the final court in ordinary civil and criminal matters by making suitable constitutional amendments,” Justice Reddy said at a farewell function organised by the Supreme Court Bar Association.The Attorney General’s suggestion may solve the issue to some extent but at the same time there was a need to address the issue of huge backlog in district courts, he said, adding faster disposal of cases required modernising the procedural laws as well.Attorney General KK Venugopal had on the Constitution Day in 2020 suggested structural change in the Judiciary to set up four Courts of Appeal—with 15 Judges each sitting in four parts of India—to hear appeals from the high courts and to make the top court a truly constitutional court.In his farewell address, CJI NV Ramana hailed Justice Reddy as a man of compassion having consciousness about social realities who upheld and protected people’s liberties.Justice Reddy, who was elevated to the apex court on November 2, 2018, has the distinction of being the first judge from Telangana, and after his retirement, the total strength of apex court judges would come down to 32 against the sanctioned strength of 34.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/justice-r-subhash-reddy-favours-creating-courts-of-appeal-358158

04-01-2022||---||SC frowns upon litigant for challenging High Court’s adjournment order||New Delhi, January 4The Supreme Court on Tuesday frowned upon litigants challenging adjournment orders passed by high courts, saying the geographical proximity shouldn’t be the sole reason for approaching it.The petitioners had challenged adjournment orders passed by the Delhi High Court, including the one passed in November 2021 posting the matter for hearing on January 28, 2022.“Just because the Delhi High Court is a stone’s throw away, you can come to the Supreme Court against orders of adjournment?” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud wondered.Disapproving of the attempt to take an undue advantage of the geographical proximity of the Delhi High Court, the Bench asked, “What should happen in Maharashtra and Manipur?”As the petitioners’ counsel said his clients were “very poor people”, the Bench shot back, “There are poor in other parts of the country also! An SLP against adjournment? We will not entertain this.”This is the second such instance in as many months. On November 22, the Supreme Court had ordered a litigant to shell out Rs 20,000 for wasting its time by filing a Special Leave Petition against an adjournment order passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.“If this is not a misuse of the process of law, one can say little else. This Court is not a walk in place only because Chandigarh happens to be in the proximity to Delhi,” a Bench led by Sanjay Kishan Kaul had told petitioner Ramesh Chander Diwan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-frowns-upon-litigant-for-challenging-high-courts-adjournment-order-358156

04-01-2022||Vijay Mohan||BRO creates record, keeps strategically vital Zoji La open in January||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 4Even as there is no sign of Sino-Indian de-escalation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) has created a new record by keeping the formidable Zoji La pass on the Srinagar–Leh National Highway open for vehicular traffic in the first week of January.The pass, located at an altitude of 11,649 feet about 100 km east of Srinagar, links the Union Territory of Ladakh with the rest of the country, and remains closed in winters due to high snow.The BRO achieved this feat through its frontline projects – Vijayak and Beacon. They are collectively responsible for maintaining the road axis that has strategic implications in addition to the socio-economic well-being of Ladakh.Last winters, the pass was kept open till December 31, which was a record. This season, BRO silently embarked on a mission to better its own record by reorganising and adding a few more snow clearance detachments and augmenting them with the state-of-the-art snow clearance equipment, according to an official statement issued today.Beacon and Vijayak projects have been working round the clock in extreme weather conditions to keep the logistic supply line open to Ladakh. Unprecedented number of troops have been deployed in Ladakh over the past about two years to counter Chinese deployments on the other side of the LAC.There are two road routes to Ladakh — along the Srinagar axis through Jammu and Kashmir and along the Manali axis through Himachal Pradesh. Both these routes become non-operational during winters as several high mountain passes enroute remain closed due to heavy snow. Supplies, equipment and troops are ferried in and out of Ladakh by air in such a situation, which continues till spring when BRO clears the snow.The administration of Ladakh and the local populace has lauded the efforts of BRO as this additional window reduces the logistic burden on government agencies and also helps the local inhabitants to stock additional rations and supplies to brave the impending harsh winters.In the first three days of the year 2022, about 178 vehicles have been able to transit through the pass with the collective assistance of the BRO and the local police personnel.The number is considered significant because with the temperatures plummeting to minus 20 degree centigrade, the road is subject to extreme frosting with blizzard like conditions, which can lead to accidents. Besides snow clearance, the road axis is subjected to maintenance on a daily basis to keep it road worthy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/bro-creates-a-record-keeps-strategically-vital-zoji-la-open-for-traffic-in-early-january-358150

The police recovered the body after much persuasion.The Prevention of Mob Violence and Mob Lynching Bill, 2021, envisages imprisonment for those pronounced guilty of mob violence and lynching for periods ranging from three years to life term, besides imposition of fine and attachment of property.Jharkhand became the third state in the country after West Bengal and Rajasthan to pass such a law. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jharkhand-man-lynched-set-on-fire-by-mob-for-felling-trees-358138

04-01-2022||---||Recognition for Taliban behind Pakistan push for SAARC summit||New Delhi, January 4Pakistan’s rediscovered enthusiasm for holding a SAARC summit in Islamabad is likely aimed at shoehorning the Taliban as the representative of Afghanistan.Reacting to Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi’s desire for a SAARC summit and advising India to attend it virtually if its leadership did not want to visit Pakistan, sources here pointed out that even before such an interaction is considered, the eight-member grouping would need to reach a consensus on who will represent Afghanistan.With the Taliban not yet recognised by a single country, it is unlikely that any of the other SAARC members, barring Pakistan, will be comfortable with sharing the round table with the insurgent group’s representatives, they added.Pakistan has been pushing the Taliban leadership’s claim at various fora but the international community will prefer to be guided by the deliberations at the United Nations. Last month, the UN Credentials Committee had failed to reach unanimity on giving representation to the Taliban and Myanmar’s military regime. The committee chief and Sweden's Permanent Representative Anna Karin Enestrom said after the closed-door meeting that it was decided "to defer its decision of the credentials" and no other meeting has been scheduled in the near future.Pakistan had sought the ouster of the Ghani-regime representative Ghulam Isaczai and his replacement by the Taliban’s Suhail Shaheen.Strangely, pointed out the sources, Pakistan’s desire for a summit of the region’s neighbours doesn't sit well with its recent attempts at infiltration into Jammu & Kashmir. In fact, one such attempt in Keran (Kupwara) out of the several over the past couple of days, was suspected to have been carried out by commandos of the Pakistan Army, they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/recognition-for-taliban-behind-pakistan-push-for-saarc-summit-358125
04-01-2022||Vijay Mohan||IAF developing real-time health monitoring system for pilots that will enhance flight safety||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 4The Indian Air Force is developing a real-time health monitoring system for aircrew that will continuously assess the fitness levels of pilots during flight and relay a warning in case of any abnormality.According to sources, the Air Force has already drawn up the conceptual requirements for the system and is taking the project forward in collaboration with the industry as well as the medical establishment.“What we are looking at,” an IAF officer said, ”is a wearable sensor like a wrist band or a stick-on patch that records the pilot’s parameters like blood pressure, temperature, heart rate and oxygen saturation level continuously or at periodic intervals and is integrated with the aircraft’s communication system so that the information is transmitted to ground control.”In case of any deviation in parameters, the sensors can sound an alarm and air traffic controllers and medical specialists can take preventive or corrective steps by advising the aircrew on how to handle the situation, he added. This is a step further in enhancing flight safety as a large proportion of aircraft accidents are attributed to human factors.Fitness and sound health of aircrew is imperative as flying, particularly in the fighter aircraft stream, involves physical, physiological and psychological stress. Fighter pilots are exposed to high g-levels, noise, lower oxygen levels and high cognitive workload.“With in-flight refuelling, the duration of fighter flying has increased, which also enhances associated risks like fatigue and physical discomfort. Remaining confined to restricted cockpit space for a long time with little physical movements also has adverse effects on the body and mind,” an officer said.Recently, the IAF’s newly inducted Rafale fighter jets had flown non-stop to India from France, a journey covering about 7,000 km in more than eight hours. It was an unprecedented cockpit experience for the IAF.Even though it was a level flight at sub-sonic speed with much reduced exposure to g-levels, the pilots had to remain alert and carry out all in-flight procedures, besides sitting in the same position in a cramped space for an extremely long time.A study published by the IAF’s Institute of Aerospace Medicine, Bengaluru, in 2021 revealed that the pain and discomfort following a six-hour prolonged restraint sitting were highly noticeable along with a significant change in the calf circumference and other physiological parameters due to effects of venous pooling. “The effects so observed could have potential flight safety implications and affect mission effectiveness,” the study observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iaf-developing-real-time-health-monitoring-system-for-pilots-that-will-enhance-flight-safety-358117
04-01-2022||New Delhi||HC asks Delhi govt to consider early re-testing of Covid-19 positive international travellers||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday said in case there were no guidelines issued by the Centre, it expected the city government to expeditiously consider the issue of early re-testing of international travellers who test positive for Covid-19 on arrival.Justice Rekha Palli, who was hearing a petition by a mother whose 18-year-old son from the United Kingdom was admitted to a private hospital here for isolation after testing positive for the virus upon his arrival, also asked the Delhi government why the genome sequencing report of the patient—who was stated to be positive for the Omicron variant—cannot be shared with him.The judge noted that during the pendency of the petition, the petitioner’s son tested negative and was discharged from Fortis Hospital.The petitioner told the court although her son was now with her, several other patients were being held up in various health facilities for days as the hospitals were not conducting Covid-19 re-tests periodically.                       It was also contended that the mother has the “right to know” and should thus be given the genome sequencing report of her son.“It is expected that in case no guidelines are issued by the Union of India, the Delhi government will expeditiously consider the matter so that patients, like the petitioner’s son, do not suffer. Delhi government will also inform why the genome test report can’t be made available,” the judge ordered.The petitioner, represented by lawyer Vikram Hegde, had moved the court last month seeking to know the outcome of the genome sequencing test carried on her son.The counsel for the hospital stated that while the Covid-19 test report has been given to the patient, the genome sequencing report, which disclosed the presence of Omicron variant, was not given to him as the same was only with the government authorities.“We don’t have a copy of the genome report. We get an excel sheet (from the authorities),” said counsel Arjun Dewan, appearing for Fortis.In response to the petitioner’s assertion that the hospital was not conducting any re-test upon her son when he was admitted, the lawyer said that the hospital administration was only following the Delhi government directive that international travellers who test positive for the virus have to be re-tested on the tenth day of the first test or after three days of being asymptomatic, whichever is later.Delhi government counsel Arun Panwar said the directive was in line with the guidelines issued by the Centre and sought time to seek instructions.Central government counsel Bharati Raju stated that there was no ban on repeat RT-PCR in their guidelines.The high court had on December 29 sought responses of the Centre and the Delhi government on the petition and had said while the protocols imposed by authorities ought to be followed, the petitioner mother was entitled to know the genome test result which was not a national secret.The petitioner had alleged that her son who tested positive for Covid-19 at the airport here after coming from the United Kingdom was not being discharged by the hospital for lack of clarity on the virus variant.She had claimed that in spite of her son being a mild case of Covid-19, the private hospital was not re-testing him.The court had directed Fortis Hospital to place on record the genome sequencing test report and also asked it to again conduct an RT-PCR test on the patient.The court had further asked the private hospital to supply the copy of both the reports, genome sequencing and RT-PCR, to the petitioner as well as Central and Delhi governments.The Centre had told the court that the Delhi government was managing the whole scenario and as per the guidelines, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) provided the report to the state government which in turn has to inform the patient.On being asked by the court if the genome test report was a confidential document as it was not shared with the patient, the counsel for the Centre had replied in the negative.The court was earlier informed that samples for genome testing of the virus have to be mandatorily sent in case of positive cases at the international airport.The matter would be heard next on January 14. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-asks-delhi-govt-to-consider-early-re-testing-of-covid-19-positive-international-travellers-358112

04-01-2022||Imphal||Previous North East governments created 'hill-valley chasm', BJP a dawn of development: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday accused the previous governments in New Delhi of neglecting Manipur and the Northeast and creating a "hill-valley chasm", while asserting the BJP-led governments at the Centre and in the state ushered in a new dawn of peace and development.The Northeast will become the driver of India's growth story, he said, after dedicating to the nation and laying the foundation stone for 22 development projects worth Rs 4,815 crore in election-bound Manipur."The previous governments in Delhi neglected Manipur and the entire Northeast, conspired to create a chasm between the hills and the valleys. Today, there is no fire of extremism and violence. We have brought in a new light of peace and development," he told a public meeting in Imphal.Modi alleged the earlier governments left Manipur and other North-Eastern states to their own devices, resulting in alienation of people. He said ever since he became the prime minister, sustained efforts were made to "narrow the distance"."After I became the PM, I brought New Delhi, the Government of India, to the doorsteps of Manipur and the Northeast. The entire region will become a major driver of India's growth," he said.Modi recalled how Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, while unfurling the tricolour at Moirang in Manipur during the second World War, had asserted it will become the gateway to India's freedom."Today, after historic peace accords signed by us, a once blockaded Manipur, the Northeast, are set to become the gateways to India's development, the gateways to international trade," he asserted.Kicking off the BJP's campaign for the assembly elections, the prime minister inaugurated an Integrated Command and Control Centre for the Imphal Smart City Mission, development of western river front on Imphal river, an industrial training institute (ITI) and a 200-bed semi-permanent Covid hospital, among others.Modi also laid the foundation stone of five national highway construction projects, government residential quarters, Manipur Institute of Performing Arts, Centre for Invention, Innovation, Incubation and Training (CIIIT), the biggest PPP initiative in Manipur, a state-of-the-art cancer hospital, besides several other projects.These projects are aimed at development of infrastructure and connectivity, skilling and employment of youth, renovation of places of historic and spiritual importance, and improvement of healthcare facilities."Earlier, the policy (of governments before the BJP came to power) was 'don't look east'. They looked at the east only during the elections. 'Act East' is our commitment. Employment and tourism will grow with increased connectivity," he asserted.Modi reeled off data to highlight how central schemes like Ayushman Bharat Yojana and Ujjwala Yojana had benefited the state's population."Your one vote changed things for the better. That's the importance of a 'double engine' government. Today, a stable and strong BJP-led government of N Biren Singh helms Manipur, while five ministers from the Northeast are handling important portfolios at the Centre," he said.Modi said, as a tribute to the freedom fighters of the state, the Union government decided to rename Mount Harriet, an island peak in Andaman and Nicobar island, Mount Manipur.He said sportspersons from Manipur, especially women like M C Marykom and Saikhom Mirabai Chanu had done India proud at various events--from Commonwealth games to the Olympics. "They are an inspiration for our youth," he said.He asked the people of Manipur to resolve not to allow the state to "slip into darkness once again". "We have to preserve this stability and take Manipur to newer heights of development," he said.

What about that? See, it is very human thing. These are schoolgirls and they only wanted to come out for a bit. But if anyone is offended for any reason, I want to apologise on behalf of the Congress," Aron reported to have said. The Congress, which has been reduced to a non-player in Uttar Pradesh, has been focusing on gender equality in view of the spiralling crime against women in the state. Some of these cases - including the gang-rape of a Dalit woman in Hathras, and a case in Unnao - made headlines and provoked outrage across the country.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra first gave the "ladki hun, lad sakti hun" election slogan last month.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stampede-like-situation-created-at-congress-bareilly-marathon-event-358097
04-01-2022||New Delhi||Weekend curfew to be imposed in Delhi amid Covid surge; Metro, buses to run with 100 pc capacity||Weekend curfew will return in the national capital as the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Tuesday decided to reimpose some more restrictions in the wake of a fresh surge in COVID-19 cases driven by the fast-spreading Omicron variant.Addressing an online press conference, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia also announced that during weekdays, government employees, barring those engaged in essential services, will be asked to work from home, while private offices will remain open with 50 per cent capacity.However, buses and Metros will return to running to their full seating capacity throughout the week as the government feared that bus stops and metro stations could become super spreaders after the seating capacity had been halved and long queues were seen at such places.“There will be a curfew on Saturdays and Sundays. People are requested to step out only when it is absolutely necessary. The weekend curfew will begin from Friday evening to Monday morning,” Sisodia said in a virtual press conference.On December 28, the DDMA declared a ‘yellow alert’ after the positivity rate crossed the 0.5 percent mark, and closed down cinemas and gyms.It had directed shops of non-essential items to open on an odd-even basis and reduced the seating capacity in metro trains and buses to 50 percent. Night curfew from 11 pm to 5 pm, is already imposed in Delhi since December 27.“Fearing that bus stops and metro stations can become super spreaders due to overcrowding, it has been decided to run buses and metro trains on full capacity. But no one can travel without a mask,” he said.There are around 11,000 active cases in Delhi. Only 350 are in hospitals. Of them 124 need oxygen, while seven are on ventilator support, Sisodia said.According to the DDMA-approved Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), a positivity rate of more than five percent for two consecutive days is one of the criteria to declare a ‘red alert’ which means a ‘total curfew’ and halting of most economic activities in the capital.Health Minister Satyendar Jain, however, asserted that the weekend curfew imposed in the city should not be treated as a lockdown.Jain and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal have been saying that most of the cases this time are mild or symptomatic and do not need medical care in hospitals.The Health Minister had said the Omicron variant of coronavirus is behind the surge in infections in the city and more restrictions will be implemented if the bed occupancy rate goes up. Nearly 5,500 fresh cases of Covid have been reported in Delhi on Tuesday with a positivity rate of about 8.5 percent.The national capital on Monday reported 4,099 fresh COVID-19 cases and the positivity rate spiraled to 6.46 percent.The central government has also allowed 50 percent of its employees below the level of Under Secretary to work from home amid rising coronavirus cases, according to a Personnel Ministry order issued on Monday.Persons with disabilities and pregnant women employees have been exempted from attending the offices, it said.

04-01-2022||New Delhi||Surge in cases indicative of third Covid wave in India: Expert||In the major Indian cities, the omicron variant of the coronavirus is accounting for more than 50 per cent of the fresh cases of the infection and the massive surge in the number of cases over the last one week is indicative of a third wave of the pandemic, as is being witnessed in several countries, Dr NK Arora, the chairman of the Covid working group of the NTAGI, said on Tuesday.Omicron is being detected in most of the states in the country, he told PTI.Noting that in the major metro centres and the surrounding regions, the new variant of the virus is accounting for over 50 per cent of the fresh cases, Arora said, "The galloping increase in the number of Covid cases over the last one week is indicative of the third wave, as is being seen in several other countries across the globe."He, however, stressed that there is no need to panic.Arora said over 80 per cent of the people in the country have been infected with the virus naturally, more than 90 per cent of the adults have received at least one dose of an anti-Covid vaccine and over 65 per cent are fully vaccinated."If we look at the behaviour of the omicron wave in South Africa, where it rapidly increased, in two weeks, the number of cases started coming down and most of the cases were either asymptomatic or had a mild illness, along with the decoupling of the total number of Covid cases vis-a-vis those requiring hospitalisation. All these factors indicate that the omicron wave in South Africa may soon subside," he said.There are some epidemiological similarities between South Africa and India. The natural infection rates in both the countries are very high, Arora pointed out, adding that however, the immunisation rates in India are several fold higher."In view of this, we may see a somewhat similar pattern in India as far as the third wave is concerned."Looking at the behaviour of the Covid infection in the last seven to 10 days in India, I feel that we may be in for a third wave peak very soon," he said.Arora, however, asserted that there is no need to press the panic button."Those who are yet to take the vaccine or are partially immunised should get the jab for protection against severe disease and hospitalisation. Also, one should strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour," he said.A total of 1,892 omicron cases have so far been detected across 23 states and Union territories in the country and of the patients, 766 have either recuperated or migrated, the Union health ministry said on Tuesday.Maharashtra has recorded the highest number of 568 omicron cases, followed by Delhi (382), Kerala (185), Rajasthan (174), Gujarat (152) and Tamil Nadu (121).With 37,379 fresh cases, India's Covid tally has climbed to 3,49,60,261, while the number of active cases of the infection has gone up to 1,71,830, according to the ministry's data updated at 8 am.

04-01-2022||Lucknow||Lord Krishna tells me daily in dreams that I'm set to establish Ram Rajya in UP after polls: Akhilesh||Samajwadi Party supremo on Monday claimed that Lord Krishna comes to his dream every night to tell him that he would form the government and establish “Ram Rajya” in Uttar Pradesh after the state's upcoming assembly polls.Former UP chief minister Yadav made the claim, albeit in a lighter vein, during a function held for the induction of BJP's Bahraich MLA Madhuri Verma into his party.Elated over the induction of sitting BJP MLA from the Nanpara assembly seat in Bahraich district, Yadav asserted that the Yogi Adityanath government has "failed" in the state.A Kurmi by caste, Verma is a second-time MLA. She was also a member of UP's Legislative Council from 2010 to 2012."The way to Ram Rajya is through the path of Samajwad (socialism). The day 'samajwad' is established, the “Ram Rajya” will be set up in the state,” the SP president said.He went on to add, “Lord Sri Krishna comes to my dreams every night to tell me that our government is coming up (in UP)."    Reacting to the BJP allegation of his party having several criminals and gangsters, Adityanath retorted, “It is the allegation of a party which made a man facing several heinous criminal cases the chief minister.”   “There were many elderly leaders in the BJP who had strengthened the party for years with their blood and sweat. They even say at times it was they who were sweating for the party but don't know where did Adityanath come from and was forced upon us,” Yadav said."I wonder if the BJP has bought a washing machine to cleanse all its criminals and mafia elements,” he wryly said.On a question on Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's statement that he would contest the upcoming assembly elections from wherever his party wants, Yadav said irrespective of where he fights from, he would face grilling from the people on his “failed” promises, including the doubling of farmers' income.

Yadav was also quoted as saying if voted to power, his party would declare Parshuram Jayanti as a public holiday.According to Samajwadi leaders, Brahmins are very happy with Akhilesh. However, as per leaders from the BJP, which too has in place a counterstrategy against SP’s “Brahmin’ outreach”, these are all “false assumptions”. Meanwhile, observers believe the politically significant community, which otherwise has been favourable towards the BJP, is “weighing options”.The buzz is that senior BJP leaders from the community are “also not too happy over the treatment meted out to them by Adityanath in the past five years”. The BJP committee aims at dispelling “all these falsehood being spread among Brahmins by the SP and BSP that the saffron party is neglecting their community”.Brahmins comprise a sizable percentage of votes and are also significant in terms of having influence beyond their actual numbers. “In rural areas and villages, the priest of the local temple is among the influencers,” say observers.As far as UP is concerned, Brahmins remained loyal to the Congress before the politics of mandir-mandal took over. However, around 70 per cent of the community is said to have voted for the BJP in 2014.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eyeing-brahmin-votes-akhilesh-prays-at-parshuram-temple-357880

Otherwise farmers and the souls of 700 deceased will never pardon them,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said today.What meghalaya governor says in videoWhen I went to meet the PM on farmers’ issues, he was full of arrogance. When I said 500 people had died, the PM asked if they had died for Modi.Sack him if he’s lying: CongLodge an FIR and sack Governor Malik if he is lying. If not, PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah must apologise. —Randeep Singh Surjewala, Cong leaderIn a viral video of an event Malik addressed in Haryana’s Dadri on Sunday, he is heard complaining of “PM’s arrogance” during a meeting the two had to discuss farmers’ agitation which ended in December after the government repealed three farm laws.“When I went to meet the PM on farmers’ issues, we ended up fighting within five minutes. He was full of arrogance. When I said 500 people had died, the PM asked if they had died for Modi. I told him yes because he has become the king on the basis of farmers’ support. The PM then told me to meet Home Minister Amit Shah who said people had clouded the PM’s vision and reason,” Malik says in the video which Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge tweeted, asking the PM if the Governor’s remarks were true.“Meghalaya’s Governor Satya Pal Malik is on record saying the PM was ‘arrogant’ on the issue of farmers and HM Amit Shah called the PM as ‘mad’. The constitutional authorities speaking about each other with such contempt! PM Modi, is this true?” asked Kharge.AICC general secretary Surjewala later said the nation was shocked with the text of the conversation between a “BJP-appointed Governor and the PM on farmers’ agitation.”To dishonour the memory of the deceased was regrettable, the Congress media chief said.PM Modi insensitivity towards farmers: BKUChandigarh: Jagdeep Singh Aulakh, core committee member of the BKU (Charuni), said the Satya Pal Malik video row had exposed PM Narendra Modi’s lack of sensitivity towards farmers’ issues. “If PM Modi had been sensitive to farmers’ issues, it would not have taken a year for his government to roll back the three contentious farm laws,” he claimed.General secretary of the Bharti Kisan Union-Lakhowal Harinder Singh Lakhowal said the PM should not have shown disrespect to the farmers. “It was owing to arrogance on the part of PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah that the farmers’ stir continued for more than a year. The PM ought to know that when people launch a stir against any decision, those at the helm of affairs have to take responsibility for the consequences,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-must-apologise-congress-after-maliks-pm-arrogant-remark-357865

The lake is barely 2-km wide at that end. The bridge will cut down a distance of 180 km on the highway that connects Tibet with Xinjiang. Pangong Tso is partly in Ladakh and partly in Tibet.Meanwhile, the flag unfurling and sloganeering, shown in images and videos tweeted by shadow social media accounts of the PLA, did not take place at the LAC in the Galwan valley where the Indian and Chinese troops had a bloody clash in June 2020, sources said.The video could have been shot anywhere along the Galwan riverbed on the Chinese side. There was no geo-coordinate to indicate that it was shot at the LAC.Area partly falls in ladakhIn the past few months, the two armies have maintained a minimum physical gap between themselves called the de-militarised zone.Congress raises flag issueThe Modi govt has compromised national security and territorial integrity. How dare China raise the flag in the Galwan valley. —CongressSources on the Indian side said images and videos of the Chinese troops showed white-coloured markings on the mountain.

Despite more infections being reported, the hospitalisation rate is low this time.The daily cases in the city have nearly touched the 100-mark while only 26 hospital beds are occupied in Chandigarh by the patients who require oxygen and ventilators. The number of active cases is 320.On March 6 last year, when Chandigarh for the first time reported a new high of 122 single-day cases after a gap three months, as many as 77 seriously ill patients were admitted to the PGIMER’s Covid block. In the entire city, over 100 patients were admitted in hospitals and there were 675 active cases.The city had exhausted its 30-40 per cent bed capacity in March, which marked the beginning of the second surge, whereas only 6 per cent of the beds are occupied now.Yashpal Garg, UT Health Secretary, said: “Most of the patients in Chandigarh are asymptomatic and undergoing home isolation. There is no panic situation, as we witnessed in the last surge.”The Chandigarh Health Bulletin for Covid shows that between December 29 and January 2 this year, the daily cases shot up from 33 to 96. This period is taken for comparison vis-à-vis the previous wave beginning since February 25. It then took at least 10 days for the city to touch the 100-mark. The number of infections rose steadily in the last wave and persisted for a longer period.In the last surge, the health care system in Chandigarh was on the edge with hospitals unable to handle the relentless inflow of patients and ran out of intensive care unit (ICU) beds.The current rise in cases comes with the spread of the new Omicron variant, with Chandigarh reporting three Omicron cases till now. Health experts say that this variant is more transmissible than the Delta variant, which had triggered the second wave. Even as the cases are rising, the Chandigarh health authorities have not been able to send enough samples for genome sequencing to keep a check on the Omicron variant.With the genome sequencing laboratory at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) unable to take samples due to logistical problems, Chandigarh will send its samples to IMTECH, Mohali.So far, Chandigarh has sent only samples of those patients who have returned from high-risk countries. Now, random samples will be sent to IMTECH to know the variant behind the spread.Tests in Mohali labWith the genome sequencing laboratory at PGIMER unable to take samples due to logistical problems, Chandigarh will send its samples to IMTECH, Mohali.Cases in Chandigarh over 10 days Second surge: 197%Feb 25,2021: 41 daily casesMar 6: 122 daily cases (675 active)Third surge: 708%Dec 24, 2021: 12 daily casesJan 2: 96 daily cases (320 active)Hospital admission 85% less this timePatients admitted 17420 on ventilator (between Feb 25 -Mar 6, 2021Patients admitted 264 on ventilator (between Dec 24 -jan 2, 2022)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/third-surge-rapid-spread-hospitalisation-low-357854

Shukla owned the Scorpio (one of the three vehicles) used in the crime.Modi govt out to protect accusedThe entire country has seen the truth of the chargesheet in a video, yet the government is trying to save the accused. —Rahul Gandhi, Congress leaderSpecial Public Prosecutor in the case SP Yadav told The Tribune that the CJM had allowed SIT’s request to bar the sharing of parts of the case evidence with anyone (including the accused) on grounds of public interest.Over 208 witnesses are learnt to have been listed in the chargesheet, with the state responsible for their safety.The chargesheet was filed within 90 days of the FIR, as mandated by law. The SIT is also likely to file a supplementary chargesheet. Meanwhile, lawyers representing the families of victim farmers are yet to receive certified copies of the chargesheet.Mohammad Amaan, who represents farmers’ families, said while the chargesheet was a step in the right direction, the absence of Minister Ajay Mishra’s name from it was a disappointment.“The original FIR application by Jagjit Singh, son of deceased farmer Nachhattar Singh, clearly named MoS Mishra. The minister’s name was however never included among the accused. We even submitted an application to the UP Police, demanding that the MoS be named as accused. Mahindra Thar that Ashish was occupying belonged to his father. We will pursue the matter in consultation with the families of the deceased,” said Amaan.Satnam Singh, the father of Lovpreet (one of the four farmers who were killed), said the charge-sheeting of the accused within 90 days was a matter of satisfaction.Besides Satnam and other affected farmers’ families, Pawan Kashyap, the brother of deceased journalist Raman Kashyap, also lamented the absence of Ajay Mishra’s name from the chargesheet.The chargesheet includes offences under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (common intention of all members of the unlawful assembly), 307 (attempt to murder), 326 (voluntary grievous hurt), 302 (murder) and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.13 accused who are already in prisonAshish Mishra ‘Monu’, Ankit Das, Nandan Singh Bisht, Satyam Tripathi, Lateef, Shekhar Bharti, Sumit Jaiswal, Ashish Pandey, Lavkush Rana, Shishu Pal, Ullas Kumar, Rinku Rana, Dharmendra Banjara and Virendra Shukla (yet to be arrested).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-minister-mishras-son-key-accused-in-kheri-chargesheet-208-witnesses-listed-357852
04-01-2022||New Delhi||China constructing bridge on its side of Pangong lake in Ladakh, say sources||A new satellite image showing China building a bridge on its side of the Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh emerged on Monday amid the prolonged Sino-India military standoff in the border area.People familiar with the development said the satellite imagery is of an area on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control(LAC) near the Galwan valley region.The armies of India and China had created a buffer zone in Galwan valley following their deadly clashes on June 15, 2020.On January 1, Indian and Chinese troops exchanged sweets and greetings at 10 border posts along the LAC including in eastern Ladakh to mark the New Year.The sources said the bridge is at a distance of around 40 km from the alignment of the LAC in the region and that India has also been developing infrastructure in the region at a rapid pace.Geo-intelligence expert Damien Symon posted a satellite image on Twitter suggesting that the new bridge was being constructed by China to link the North and South banks of Pangong lake.Military experts said the aim of constructing the bridge in the Khurnak area could be to ensure that the Chinese People's Liberation Army(PLA) is able to quickly mobilise its troops in the region.The Indian military sources said India has been developing infrastructure in all key areas along the LAC and that India is aware of Chinese activities in the region.Last week, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the Chisumle-Demchok road at Umling La Pass at over 19,000 feet in Ladakh that is considered as a key stretch for military purpose.China has been focusing on strengthening its military infrastructure after Indian troops took control of several strategic peaks on the southern bank of Pangong lake in August 2020 after the Chinese PLA attempted to intimidate them in the area.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the armies of India and China erupted on May 5, 2020, following a violent clash in the Pangong lake area.Both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process last year in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake and in the Gogra area.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC in the sensitive sector.The 13th round of Corps Commander-level military talks in October ended in a stalemate with the Indian Army saying that the ''constructive suggestions'' made by it were not agreeable to the Chinese side.The defence ministry last Friday said it held several rounds of military talks with the Chinese side to deescalate the situation in eastern Ladakh without compromising on its stand of ''complete disengagement and immediate restoration of status quo ante''.India has been insisting on returning to the status quo that existed before the face-off erupted.

04-01-2022||Lakhimpur Kheri (UP)||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: SIT files 5,000-page chargesheet, MoS Ajay Mishra's son named accused||The SIT probing the Lakhimpur Kheri violence on Monday filed a chargesheet against 14 people, including Union Minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish, who has been named the main accused.The 5,000-page chargesheet, which was submitted in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) Chinta Ram, said Ashish Mishra was at the spot where the violence took place. It did not have the name of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra, said sources.The complainant in the case, Jagjit Singh, had alleged in the FIR registered at the Tikonia police station that the Union minister and his son had “hatched the conspiracy” and they should be named in the FIR.Senior prosecution officer (SPO) SP Yadav said, “In the statements of witnesses, Ashish Mishra Monu’s presence on the spot had been stated and the same was the part of the case diary.”        When asked to further elaborate and confirm if the minister’s name is in the chargesheet, Yadav said, “I haven’t gone through thousands of pages of the chargesheet. Hence, I am unable to respond further.”Along with the minister’s son, the FIR names Ankit Das, Nandan Singh Bisht, Satyam Tripathi, alias Satyam, Latif, alias Kale, Shekhar Bharti, Sumit Jaiswal, Ashish Pandey, Lavkush Rana, Shishu Pal, Ullas Kumar, alias Mohit Trivedi, Rinku Rana and Dharmendra Banjara.Apart from the 13 people arrested so far, another accused Virendra Shukla’s name has been added in the chargesheet under Section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code, Yadav told reporters in Lakhimpur Kheri.Shukla is yet to be arrested and he is the minister’s relative, said Yadav.The charges include murder, attempt to murder and violations under the Arms Act.The senior prosecution officer said the court accepted the charge sheet and fixed January 10 as the next date of hearing.Virendra Shukla has been asked to be present in the court on that day.The filing of the charge sheet has renewed the demand for the minister’s dismissal.“The entire country has seen the truth of the 5,000-page chargesheet in the form of a video. Yet the Modi government is trying to save the accused. India is a witness! #Lakhimpur#Farmers”, Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi, while seeking the dismissal of Ajay Mishra.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi said, “They are in the position of protector but stand with the destroyer. In the charge sheet of the Lakhimpur Kheri massacre case, the son of the Union Minister of State for Home is the main accused in the crushing of farmers.”              “But due to Narendra Modiji’s patronage, Minister Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ did not even come under the scrutiny of the investigation and he remains in his post,” Priyanka alleged demanding the sacking of the minister.Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav in a tweet said the charge sheet has exposed the double-engine government of the BJP. “Today, every supporter-worker of the BJP is embarrassed and scared of social boycott,” he said. The incident had taken place on October 3. Eight people were killed, four of them farmers allegedly mowed down by an SUV in which some BJP workers were travelling.Two BJP workers and their driver were lynched by angry farmers. A journalist also died. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-sit-files-5-000-page-chargesheet-mos-ajay-mishras-son-named-accused-357828
04-01-2022||---||PM Modi to lay foundation stones of projects worth over Rs 42,000 crore in poll-bound Punjab on Jan 5||New Delhi, January 3Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Ferozepur in poll-bound Punjab on January 5 and lay foundation stones of multiple development projects worth more than Rs 42,750 crore.These projects include the Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway, the four laning of Amritsar-Una section, the Mukerian-Talwara New Broad Gauge railway line, a PGI Satellite Centre at Ferozepur and two new medical colleges at Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur.An official release said that the consistent endeavour of the Prime Minister to improve connectivity all across the country has led to multiple national highway development initiatives being taken up in the state of Punjab.“It has resulted in more than doubling the total length of National highways in the state from about 1,700 kilometres in 2014 to more than 4100 kilometres in 2021. In continuation of such efforts the foundation stone of two major road corridors will be laid in Punjab. This will also be a step towards fulfilling the Prime Minister’s vision to enhance accessibility to major religious centres,” a release said.The 669-kilometre long Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway will be developed at a total cost of about Rs 39,500 crore. It will halve travel time from Delhi to Amritsar and Delhi to Katra.The Greenfield Expressway will connect key Sikh religious sites at Sultanpur Lodhi, Goindwal Sahib, Khadoor Sahib, Tarn Taran and the holy Hindu shrine of Vaishno Devi in Katra in J&K.The expressway will also connect key economic centres like Ambala, Chandigarh, Mohali, Sangrur, Patiala, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Kathua and Samba in Haryana, Chandigarh, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.The four-laning of Amritsar-Una section will be done at the cost of around 1,700 crore. The 77-kilometre long section is part of the larger Amritsar to Bhota corridor spanning across the longitudinal expanse of northern Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, connecting four major national highways—Amritsar-Bhatinda-Jamnagar Economic Corridor, Delhi–Amritsar–Katra Expressway, North-South Corridor and Kangra-Hamirpur-Bilaspur-Shimla Corridor.It will help in improving the connectivity of religious sites at Ghoman, Shri Hargobindpur and Pulpukta town (home to famous Gurudwara Pulpukta Sahib).The Prime Minister will lay the foundation stone of a new broad gauge railway line between Mukerian and Talwara, of around 27 Km in length, to be built at a cost of over Rs 410 crore. The railway line will be an extension of Nangal Dam-Daulatpur Chowk railway section.It will provide an all-weather means of transportation in the area. This project also holds strategic importance as it will serve as an alternative route to Jammu and Kashmir, joining the existing Jalandhar-Jammu railway line at Mukerian in Punjab.The project will prove especially beneficial for the people of Hoshiarpur in Punjab and Una in Himachal Pradesh. It will give a boost to tourism in the region, and provide ease of connectivity to hill stations, as well as to places of religious importance.“In line with the Prime Minister’s endeavour to provide world class medical facilities in all parts of the country, foundation stone of new medical infrastructure in three towns of Punjab will be laid,” a statement said.The 100-bedded PGI Satellite Centre at Ferozepur will be built at a cost of more than Rs 490 crore. It will provide services in 10 specialities, including internal medicine, general surgery, orthopedics, plastic surgery, neurosurgery, obstetrics & gynaecology, paediatrics, ophthalmology, ent and psychiatry-drug de-addiction. The satellite centre will provide world-class medical facilities at Ferozepur and nearby areas.Two medical colleges at Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur will be developed at a cost of around Rs 325 crore each and with a capacity of about 100 seats. These colleges have been approved in Phase-III of the Centrally-sponsored scheme, ‘Establishment of new medical colleges attached with district/ referral hospitals’.A total of three medical colleges have been approved for Punjab under this scheme. The college approved at SAS Nagar in Phase-I is already functional.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/pm-modi-to-lay-foundation-stones-of-projects-worth-over-rs-42-000-crore-in-punjab-on-jan-5-357821
04-01-2022||---||Book Meghalaya Governor Malik if he's lying, otherwise apologise: Congress to PM Modi||New Delhi, January 3Meghalaya Governor Satya Pal Malik’s remarks quoting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in context of farmers and their year-long agitation against the three agricultural reform laws on Monday saw the opposition Congress mounting a major political offensive on the government demanding PM’s apology if the remarks were true.Lodge an FIR and sack Governor Malik if he is lying. If not, PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah must come forward and apologise. Otherwise, the farmers and the souls of 700 deceased farmers and their families will never pardon you,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said today.In a viral video of an event Malik addressed in Haryana’s Dadri on Sunday, he is heard saying that when he went to meet the PM in respect of the farmers’ agitation, the two ended up fighting in five minutes.“When I went to meet the PM on the farmers’ issue, we ended up fighting in five minutes. He was in tremendous arrogance. When I told him 500 people died, the PM asked me whether they had died for me. I told him yes the farmers died because of him because he had become king on the basis of their support. Then the PM told me to meet Home Minister Amit Shah. Shah said people had clouded his vision and power of reason. Shah asked me to keep my meetings going,” Malik says in the video, which Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge earlier tweeted asking the PM if the remarks were true.Surjewala said the entire nation was stunned and shocked with the text of the conversation between a “BJP-appointed Governor and the PM on the farmers’ agitation.”“The real arrogant, anti farmer, insensitive face of PM Modi, the face of the BJP and the government which truly only works for crony capitalists and at the peril of farmers and farm labourers now stands exposed. Never in the history of India has the PM dared to say about India’s toiling farmers—so what if 500 farmers have died, they have not died for Modi.”Surjewala asked if this was the language the PM should use for the farmers.“The farmers did not die for the PM or the BJP. They died to protect food security and for justice to farmers of India. To dishonour their memory by none other than the PM is most regrettable,” said Surjewala.The Congress also demanded that the PM should come forward and announce compensation for the next of kin of the deceased farmers, withdrawal of every criminal case registered against them from UP to Haryana and formation of a committee to determine a legally guaranteed MSP.“The PM should ensure the committee is not only formed in the next 24 hours, it also releases its report in 30 days. This is the least that is expected of the PM.The PM can no longer remain silent,” said Surjewala.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/book-meghalaya-governor-malik-if-hes-lying-otherwise-apologise-congress-to-pm-modi-357816
04-01-2022||New Delhi||EWS quota in NEET: SC to take it up on Wednesday||The Supreme Court is likely to take up on Wednesday the issue of the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) quota in NEET for admissions to PG medical courses after the Centre sought an urgent hearing in view of protests by doctors.”I have to constitute a Special Bench. Let me see tomorrow,” Chief Justice of India NV Ramana told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta after the latter submitted that the issue of EWS quota in admissions to postgraduate medical courses needed to be taken up urgently as students were facing difficulties.”If it is a three-judge Bench matter then it will be listed before a three-judge Bench tomorrow,” the CJI told Mehta who sought urgent listing of the case.The Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association has been holding large scale protests in Delhi and other parts of the country over the delay in the NEET-PG counselling, which has been postponed due to the Centre deciding to revisit the criteria for the determination of the EWS quota.On Monday, a bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud had told the Centre that a Bench of requisite strength could be set up by the CJI as the EWS quota matter was being heard by a three-judge Bench.The top court is hearing petitions challenging 27 per cent reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and 10 per cent quota for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) introduced by the Centre this year in the All-India Quota (AIQ) seats in state medical institutions.On October 25, the Centre had told the top court that counselling for PG medical courses will not start till the court decided the matter.The court is examining the feasibility of having Rs 8 lakh as a cap to avail the EWS quota for PG medical admissions.In an affidavit filed in the top court, the Centre said it has decided to accept the recommendation of a three-member panel to retain the current gross annual family income limit of Rs 8 lakh or less for defining EWS.Set up November 30 last year, the panel headed by former Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey submitted its report on December 31. It concluded that family income was a “feasible criterion” for defining EWS and, in the current situation, a threshold of Rs 8 lakh of annual family income seemed reasonable.The panel recommended that “only those families whose annual income is up to Rs 8 lakh would be eligible to get the benefit of EWS reservation”, it told the court. It said, “EWS may, however exclude, irrespective of income, a person whose family has five acres or more of agricultural land.”The process to revisit the criteria delayed the NEET-PG 2021 counselling triggered protests by doctors in Delhi and elsewhere seeking expeditious removal of the legal impediments. The protesting doctors said due to a delay of eight months in counselling of the NEET-PG 2021 batch, there was an “acute shortage” of resident doctors across India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-seeks-early-hearing-on-ews-quota-in-neet-counselling-for-admission-to-pg-medical-courses-357773
