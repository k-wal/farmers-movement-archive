Assistant Guard has been redesignated as ‘Assistant Passenger Train Manager’ and Senior Passenger Guard as ‘Senior Passenger Train Manager’.The redesignation comes after the Railways effected a corporate image makeover after adding the title of CEO to the post of Railway Board Chairman.With the Railways planning to allow private players to operate trains, these changes in nomenclature are natural and in line with modernisation of the railways, officials said.Officials also said the demand was that the existing designation “Trains Guard” has become outdated.They said that trains guards are in charge of their respective trains.“It would, therefore, be quite appropriate that the existing designation of Trains Guard be changed to ‘Train Manager’, which would be a dignified designation for them without any financial implication, so that, they can also lead a respectful life in the society,” an official said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/train-guards-redesignated-as-train-managers-361286

14-01-2022||New Delhi||India’s desire for peace is born out of strength, should not be mistaken otherwise: Army Chief||The Indian Army stands firm to counter any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo along the country’s borders and India’s desire for peace is born out of strength and should not be mistaken otherwise, Army Chief General MM Naravane said on Friday.The Army Chief also said that differences in perceptions and disputes are best resolved through established norms based on the principle of equal and mutual security.The armies of India and China are locked in a military standoff in eastern Ladakh since May 5, 2020, after a violent clash erupted in the Pangong lake area.Both the countries have conducted 14 rounds of military-level talks to resolve the standoff.“We stand firm to counter any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo along our borders. Our response to such attempts has been swift, calibrated and decisive as was seen when the situation so demanded,” Naravane said in his speech on the eve of Army Day.Naravane said the Army has instituted additional safeguards to prevent any further attempts at military brinkmanship.“We believe that the differences in perceptions and disputes are best resolved through established norms based on the principle of equal and mutual security,” he mentioned.“Our desire for peace and tranquillity is born out of our inherent strength. It should not be mistaken otherwise,” he added.Institutional mechanisms and safeguards to counter state-sponsored terrorism have been strengthened both along the borders and the hinterland, Naravane mentioned.These mechanisms and safeguards have proven effective in lowering the levels of violence, he said.“Our actions have demonstrated our capability and willingness to strike at the source of terrorism,” the Army chief mentioned.In the year gone by, the Indian Army has resolutely executed its responsibilities and was steadfast in safeguarding the security and territorial integrity of the nation, he said.India’s active borders were guarded with resolve and resilience, he mentioned.“Our brave officers, JCOs (junior commissioned officers), and soldiers, have faced adversaries and adversity with courage and fortitude even to the extent to laying down their lives in the highest traditions of the Indian Army,” Naravane said.The Indian Army remains at a high state of operational readiness to face ongoing and future challenges, he said.After the violent clash on May 5, 2020, both—Indian and Chinese militaries—gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process last year in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake and in the Gogra area.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-desire-for-peace-is-born-out-of-strength-should-not-be-mistaken-otherwise-army-chief-361281
14-01-2022||New Delhi||Media reports claiming under-reporting of Covid deaths ill-informed, baseless & misleading: Govt||The Health Ministry has refuted media reports alleging a “significant undercount” of COVID-19 deaths in the first two waves in India, saying these are fallacious, ill-informed and mischievous in nature.The Government of India has a very comprehensive definition to classify Covid deaths, based on globally acceptable categorisation, it said.In a statement, the ministry refuted some media reports alleging a “significant undercount” of the actual number of people who have died in India due to COVID-19 in the first two waves and that the final toll may be “substantially greater” crossing the figures of about three million.“It is clarified that such media reports are fallacious and ill-informed. They are not based on facts and are mischievous in nature. India has a very robust system of birth and death reporting which is based on a statute and is carried out regularly from the gram panchayat level to the district level and state level,” the statement said.The ministry said the whole exercise is carried out under the overall oversight of the Registrar-General of India (RGI).“Moreover, the Government of India has a very comprehensive definition to classify Covid deaths, based on globally acceptable categorisation. All deaths are being independently reported by states, and are being compiled centrally. The backlog in COVID-19 mortality data being submitted by the states at different times are being reconciled in the data of Govt of India on a regular basis,” it said.A large number of states have regularly reconciled their death numbers and have reported arrear deaths in a broadly transparent manner. Therefore, to project that deaths have been under-reported is without basis and without justification, it added.The ministry clarified that there is an “extreme difference” in Covid case load and linked mortality between Indian states.“Any assumptions putting all states in one envelope would mean mapping skewed data of outliers together with states reporting lowest mortality which is bound to stretch the median towards higher and wrong results,” the ministry said.Furthermore, there is an incentive in India to report Covid deaths as they are entitled to monetary compensation. Hence, the likelihood of under-reporting is less, it said.“During a disruptive situation like the pandemic, the actual mortality could be more than the reported deaths due to many factors, even in the most robust health systems. However, any analysis with the view to deduce information collected from extremely varied caseload and outcome situations among Indian states is bound to be incomplete and incorrect,” the statement said.These current media reports on “significant undercount” of the actual number of people who have died in India are based on a study which seems biased in nature as only adults with COVID-19 symptoms were captured and cannot be thus representative of the general population, the statement said.“There also appears to be selection bias as the survey is restricted to phone owning people who can also take out time to answer questions comprehensively. The sample could be skewed towards urban areas in that sense, where more cases were reported, and thus, have a higher reporting. They are also people likely to be more aware and have greater reporting bias,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/media-reports-claiming-under-reporting-of-covid-deaths-ill-informed-baseless-misleading-govt-361276

A team of officials of the district administration and police had gone there,” a senior official of the Lucknow district administration said.When asked about action being taken in the matter, Lucknow District Magistrate Abhishek Prakash had told PTI, “Action as per law is being taken.” The Election Commission has banned public rallies, roadshows and corner meetings till January 15 in the five poll-bound states, citing the fresh surge in Covid-19 cases, and issued stringent safety guidelines.The Commission listed out 16-point guidelines for campaigning as it banned ‘nukkad sabhas’ (corner meetings) on public roads and roundabouts, limited the number of persons allowed for the door-to-door campaign to five, including the candidate, and prohibited victory processions after the counting of votes.Capital Lucknow and other parts of Uttar Pradesh have been also witnessing a spurt in coronavirus cases .||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/massive-crowd-at-sp-office-fir-lodged-for-violation-of-covid-norms-361271

She was bleeding and was admitted to the district hospital. Later, she was referred to the J K Lone Hospital here.According to doctors, her rectum was displaced and she underwent a two-and-a-half-hour surgery.The police earlier said it appeared to be a case of rape but maintained that anything conclusive could only be said after the report of the medical jurist was out.Alwar Superintendent of Police Tejaswani Gautam told reporters that the girl travelled around 25 km from her village and reached Alwar city in an auto-rickshaw. She then walked towards the Tijara Fatak bridge “on her own”.“We have been able to track the girl’s movements and traced the auto-rickshaw in which she travelled with 8-10 other passengers.A team of forensic experts have not found anything suspicious in the auto-rickshaw. The driver was interrogated and her co-passengers will be questioned,” the SP said.Gautam said the girl’s medical report is yet to be out and teams have been investigating the case based on the FIR.CCTV footage collected from various locations showed her walking in many areas of the city and on the bridge, but no camera found her in a distressed condition on the bridge, police said.Meanwhile, a child psychologist and experts also interacted with the girl.

However, when the issue is used selectively to push political ambition and agenda like Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi have done, it becomes unforgivable,” he said, adding that neither Priyanka nor her brother Rahul visited the victim’s family or met her, as she battles for life in hospital, like they do in states that are not ruled by the CongressPatra also alleged that Priyanka was celebrating her birthday at Ranthambhore in Rajasthan and a BJP delegation wanting to meet her over the issue was denied access. He also asked if she had sought a report from Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot about the ghastly incident. Patra also objected to a comment attributed to the state’s WCD Minister that the accused were not sporting a ‘tilak’ that they could be identified and demanded an apology from her and Gehlot. The Rajasthan State Human Rights Commission on Thursday directed the Alwar district administration and the SP to submit a report by January 18 in connection with the assault of the girl found in a distressed state with injuries on her private parts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priyanka-gandhi-indulging-in-selective-politics-bjp-361262
14-01-2022||Kochi||Prima facie, malls don’t have rights to collect parking fees: Kerala High Court||The Kerala High Court on Friday said prima facie, it was of the opinion that malls don’t have the right to collect parking fees and asked Kalamassery municipality whether it had issued any license to the Lulu International shopping mall at Ernakulam for the same.Justice P V Kunhikrishnan, while hearing a plea that the mall was illegally collecting parking fees from customers, however, did not ask the mall to stop the collection but said it would be at their risk.“As per the Building Rules, sufficient area for parking space is necessary for constructing a building. Parking space is part of the building. The building permit is issued on condition that there will be parking space. Based on this undertaking the building is constructed. After constructing the building, whether the owner of the building can collect parking fee is the question. Prima facie I am of the opinion that it is not possible,” the court said in its order.The court has asked the municipality to file a statement about its stand regarding the issue and posted the matter for further hearing on January 28.“Further collection of the parking fee by respondent (Lulu Mall) for parking vehicles in the area which is earmarked in the building permit for parking will be subject to the result of the final decision of this writ petition. But I make it clear that they can collect the parking fee at their risk,” the court said.Petitioner Pauly Vadakkan, a film director, has contended that the mall’s management was responsible for providing free parking to customers.Vadakkan moved the high court after Rs 20 as parking fees was collected from him when he had visited the mall on December 2.He has alleged that the mall staff closed the exit gates and threatened him when he initially refused to pay the amount.“The parking area in a commercial complex is a public place meant for the purpose of the customers visiting that commercial complex and the 1st respondent (Lulu) in no way can collect parking fees for the same,” it was contended.However, this contention was opposed by Lulu’s lawyer, who said that the mall has a license.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prima-facie-malls-dont-have-rights-to-collect-parking-fees-kerala-high-court-361259

14-01-2022||New Delhi/Geneva||WEF to host online Davos Agenda summit next week; PM Modi’s address on Monday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the online Davos Agenda summit of the World Economic Forum on the first day of the five-day event beginning January 17, joining a host of other global leaders who will share their visions for 2022 on the state of the world.While the WEF had to defer its physical annual meeting in the Swiss ski resort town Davos due to the coronavirus pandemic, it will host the ‘Davos Agenda’ summit digitally for the second consecutive year in the previously scheduled week for the event. It hopes to convene the 2022 annual meeting later this year.Announcing the schedule, the WEF said ‘Davos Agenda 2022’ will be the first global platform for key world leaders to share their visions for 2022 and it is being convened on the theme of ‘The State of the World’.Heads of state and government will join CEOs and other leaders for a virtual week-long dialogue on critical collective challenges and how to address them, while this dialogue will be a springboard to the Annual Meeting in Davos, scheduled for early summer.In addition to Modi, the world leaders delivering ‘State of the World’ special addresses will include Chinese President Xi Jinping, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Japan’s Prime Minister Kishida Fumio, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, US Treasury Secretary Janet L Yellen, and Nigeria’s Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo.Listed sessions include those related to COVID-19, technology cooperation, global social contract, vaccine equity, energy transition, climate innovation, restoring trust in world trade, global economic outlook and building future preparedness.Geneva-based WEF, which describes itself as an international organisation for public-private cooperation, said radically different pandemic experiences have exacerbated global divisions, while vaccine inequities, combined with new strains, have also slowed international economic recovery.However, COVID-19 is only one of the critical global challenges which may become unmanageable unless world leaders prioritize proactive collaboration and therefore the Davos Agenda will focus on driving concerted action among key global stakeholders, it added.Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, said, “Everyone hopes that in 2022 the COVID-19 pandemic, and the crises that accompanied it, will finally begin to recede. But major global challenges await us, from climate change to rebuilding trust and social cohesion.“To address them, leaders will need to adopt new models, look long term, renew cooperation and act systemically. The Davos Agenda 2022 is the starting point for the dialogue needed for global cooperation in 2022.”               Through special addresses and panels with leaders of G20 economies and international organisations, the Davos Agenda 2022 will provide crucial insights into a range of critical challenges. Participants will hear first-hand how these leaders will drive action in these and other areas, the WEF said.The summit will also mobilize government and business leaders, international organizations and civil society to share their outlook, insights and plans relating to the most urgent global issues such as climate change, social contracts and vaccine equity. These sessions will also provide a platform for a wider connection, enabling the global public to engage and be included in the conversation.The world leaders expected to attend the event include WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, Special Presidential Envoy for Climate of the US John F Kerry, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde and WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.The Davos Agenda 2022 will also mark the launch of several WEF initiatives to accelerate the race to net-zero emissions, the economic opportunity of nature-positive solutions and cyber resilience.Other launches on a diverse range of critical topics will also take place between January 17-21 and these include strengthening the resilience of global value chains, building economies in fragile markets through humanitarian investing, bridging the vaccine manufacturing gap and using data solutions to prepare for the next pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wef-to-host-online-davos-agenda-summit-next-week-pm-modis-address-on-monday-361249

That is, two side/side torso airbags and two side curtain/tube airbags covering all outboard passengers. This is a crucial step to make motor vehicles in India safer than ever," he said.According to Gadkari, this will ultimately ensure the safety of passengers across all segments, irrespective of the cost/variant of the vehicle. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/minimum-6-airbags-to-be-made-mandatory-in-vehicles-that-can-carry-up-to-8-passengers%C2%A0-gadkari-361242

There is no coronavirus at the moment and even if there is any it will not be able to infect me because I am doubly vaccinated and I chant the ‘Mahamrityunjaya mantra (prayer) everyday,” Sukanta Giri told PTI.“Hum to mast hai. Coronavirus hum ko chu nahi payega. Hum bindass hai. Hum Gangasnan ke liye aye hai. Corona kuch nahi kar payega humara (I am a fearless person and coronavirus will not be able to do anything to me because I have come here for the holy dip in Gangasagar),” HC Budhiraja, a resident of Ahmedabad, who has come with his old parents, Harshvardhan Budhiraja and Poonam, told this reporter.Rajendra Pal of Rajasthan’s Ajmer added that he firmly believed taking a dip in seawater at Sagar will “kill any form of bacteria or virus and ward off sins”.“Hum to bhagyashali hai ke hum Gangasagar mein dubki lagane ko aa paye hai. Coronavirus bol ke kuch nahi hain, aur Gangasagar mein nahaney se sab bacteria, virus mar jata hai. Gangasagar ke pani mein sab paap, virus khatam hota hai. (I am lucky to have come here for the holy dip. If you get a chance to take the holy dip, all coronavirus and bacteria along with your sins will be washed away),” Pal said.Many of sadhus and the pilgrims were also reluctant to take the RT-PCR tests which have been made mandatory by the Calcutta High Court to go to the Sagar Island for the annual congregation, a senior official of the health department said.“It’s like a test of our patience. They are reluctant and giving us funny excuses not to undertake the RT-PCR tests or vaccines. We have to literally fight with them to collect the swabs. At times we are taking help from policemen to explain that unless they are tested, they will not be able to proceed from this point (Babughat),” the doctor said.Senior police officers of Kolkata Police also echoed similar difficulties while managing the pilgrims at Babughat where several tens of thousands of pilgrims are passing through.“We are only allowing those who test negative in the RT-PCR and have double vaccination certificates . And we are administering the second dose to all those who do not have got it,” another doctor said.However, the queue outside such RT-PCR and vaccine camps became yet another example of violation of the Covid-19 protocol where the physical distancing has gone for a toss.“Hum saath saath aaye hai aur saath saath hi rajenge. Corona hum ko nahi hoga agar hum apne logo ke saath rahenge. (We have come together and cannot leave each other. Coronavirus will not be able to cause any harm to us,” Gauri Chaturvedi, who was seen standing in the queue of a vaccination camp with her daughter-in-law said.According to a senior police officer of Kolkata Police the crowd was far less comparing to other years, probably because of the curbs imposed by the state government due to the ongoing surge in the Covid-19 pandemic.Pilgrims from Babughat board vehicles arranged by the state government to take them to the Kakdwip from where they take boats and vessels to the Sagar Island.A Calcutta High Court division bench comprising Chief Justice Prakash Shrivastava and Justice Kesong Doma Bhutia allowed the annual fair to take place from January 8 and 16 and ordered that the entire Sagar Island be declared a notified area.The bench also constituted a two-member committee comprising former Justice Samapti Chatterjee and member secretary of the West Bengal Legal Services Authority to recommend the state government ban the entry of pilgrims to the island in case of violation of safety norms.The bench ordered that all pilgrims must be fully vaccinated and should test negative for Covid-19 in an RT-PCR test conducted within 72 hours before reaching the venue. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/blind-faith-among-gangasagar-pilgrims-sees-covid-safety-norms-given-a-go-by-361232

Until 2020, when the first lockdown happened, Salil lived a comfortable life with his wife and 10-year-old son. During the first wave of Covid-19, he lost his job and in the second wave, he lost his father. Within a year, this hotel management graduate from Ayodhya, who according to The Indian Express worked in several high-profile hotels, lost his job as a manager at a restaurant in Delhi’s Hudson Lane.

Collaborative work of parents, psychiatrists, psychologists, paediatricians, and community health workers will be required to counter the post-Covid challenges in this vulnerable age group,” the paper titled “Impact of Covid-19 on child health and healthcare services,” states.According to experts, children from low socioeconomic populations and those in already destitute or vulnerable situations suffer a harder blow as they are the ones who might be more impoverished or deprived of essential healthcare services. “Children seem to be the greatest victim in this universal crisis,” the paper observed.Experts have asked policymakers to ensure affordable and equitable access to healthcare services with prioritisation for vulnerable children and their families, especially those with pre-existing health conditions, as the public health emergency which has grown tremendously in magnitude over time, continues.Calling for an increase in public health investment so that safe and nutritious food is affordable and accessible for all, the paper has suggested scaling up social protection schemes. Providing information on nutrition and guidance on infant and child feeding, involvement of civil society organisations and communities in the monitoring of service provision, addressing livelihood and food supply challenges are some of the key issues to be addressed in order to build up a strong and resilient public health and nutrition system as a response to any public health emergency, the paper adds.The government should ensure that there is no disruption of essential healthcare services, which are critical for child survival in terms of immunisation, child health, nutrition, education, etc. “Clear-cut guidelines should be issued by the respective state and district health authorities regarding the availability of routine immunisation services,” the paper stresses.Pointing out that children and young adolescents need to be educated about Covid-19 and preventive behaviour, which will be helpful in the long run, experts have also advised mental health check-ups of children and students and projected the urgent requirement of coordinated and innovative mental healthcare delivery for children and adolescents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/experts-red-flag-impact-of-covid-19-on-children-call-for-urgent-reforms-in-child-healthcare-services-361226

The case was lodged by a woman against her husband and in-laws for subjecting her to cruelty.The apex court's observations came while hearing an appeal against an order passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana dismissing a plea by a man seeking permission to return to the US, where he is employed.The high court had rejected the man's prayer to leave the country as he was arrayed as an accused along with his elder brother and parents under sections Sections 323 (voluntary causing hurt), 34 (common intention), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) 498A and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.“Taking custody of jewellery for safety cannot constitute cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A of the IPC.“Failure to control an adult brother, living independently, or giving advice to the complainant to adjust to avoid vindictive retaliation cannot constitute cruelty on the part of the Appellant within the meaning of Section 498A of the IPC,” the apex court bench said in a recent order.It said the complainant (daughter-in-law) has not given any particulars of the jewellery that had allegedly been taken by her mother-in-law and brother-in- law.There is not a whisper of whether any jewellery is lying with the petitioner, it said.“There is only a general omnibus allegation that all the accused ruined the life of the complainant by misrepresentation, concealment, etc…  “The Appellant is not liable for the acts of cruelty, or any other wrongful and/or criminal acts on the part of his parents or brother,” the apex court said.The top court said considering the nature of the allegations, it is not understood how and why the petitioner should have been detained in India.“In our considered opinion, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kurukshetra, erred in directing the appellant not to leave the country without prior permission of the Court.It said the allegations in the complaint against the petitioner prima facie do not disclose any offence under Section 498A of the IPC, which contemplates cruelty.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/taking-custody-of-brides-jewellery-for-safety-not-cruelty-under-section-498a-of-ipc-361208

China on General’s remarksSources told The Tribune there would be no immediate disengagement of troops from Patrolling Point (PP)-15, also known as Hot Springs. Resultantly, Indian forces would stick to their locations and positions at the LAC. Weapons, equipment, tanks, artillery guns and other high technology surveillance systems would also be around. Both sides have some 75,000 troops in the sector.A statement issued by the Ministry of Defence on Thursday evening said representatives from the defence and foreign affairs establishments of the two sides were present at the meeting. “They agreed that both sides should follow the guidance provided by the state leaders and work for the resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest.”The statements issued by both sides were not as blunt and sharp as those issued after the 13th round of talks on October 10, 2021, when they blamed each other for the failure of the talks.This time, the statement said: “The two sides have agreed to stay in close contact and maintain dialogue via military and diplomatic channels and work out a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest.” It also spoke about agreeing to hold the next round of the commanders’ talks at the earliest. Since June 2020, there have been 14 rounds of talks. Though there has been partial success, troop build-up on either side, for now, shows no signs of getting back to the pre-April 2020 levels. At the talks yesterday, India and China agreed that the two sides would consolidate the “previous outcomes” and take effective efforts to maintain the security and stability on the ground in the western sector.Sources explained the “previous outcomes” mentioned in the statement referred to the disengagement at PP-17, PP-17A, and north and south banks of the Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake. India shares 832-km LAC with China in the eastern Ladakh sector.Yesterday, Army Chief General MM Naravane at a press conference in the Capital had mentioned a three-step process to ease the standoff: disengagement of troops, de-escalation of tension followed by deinduction of all troops, weapons and equipment. “Till these steps are completed, we have to remain there (LAC),” he had said. He had added that each round of talks might not “have an outcome”.There has been one fatal clash at Galwan in June 2020, leading to deaths on both sides. Gun shots (the first since 1967) were fired across the LAC in August 2020 and there have been at least two hand-to-hand fights in which dozens were injured on both sides.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-fail-to-end-lac-deadlock-but-both-agree-on-holding-more-talks-361025

One more minister and two MLAs quit the party on Thursday. The total number of leaders who left the saffron party since Tuesday rose to nine. Rebel leaders Swami Prasad Maurya and Dara Singh Chauhan warned of more resignations.Rebels meet SP ChiefOBC leader Dharam Singh Saini, who became the third minister to resign from the Yogi Adityanath Cabinet this week, claimed the trouble within the BJP started more than a year ago. “Almost 140 MLAs launched a dharna against the government because of the way oppressed and backward were being treated. We were waiting for the right moment. One minister is resigning every day. This will go on till January 20,” he said.Maurya, who today led rebel leaders at a meeting with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, claimed “endgame” for the BJP. “I will not give up till they (the BJP and RSS) are wiped out from UP,” he tweeted in Hindi.Shikohabad MLA Mukesh Verma while resigning from the party cited the UP government’s “lack of respect” towards backward classes and Dalits as the reason.While most of the legislators belong to the OBC category, a Brahmin MLA, Bala Prasad Awasthi, is also believed to have walked out of the BJP today, sources said. The four-term MLA from Lakhimpur Kheri is a known Brahmin face in the Terai region.

Priyanka, however, said she would continue to work in UP even after the elections and contribute to other states as well, should the party ask her to.The candidate list, she said, sends out the message “that the Congress will support those fighting against injustice. It will help them enter electoral politics and take power into their own hands to bring their struggles to fruition.” She also said the Congress wanted to herald a “new kind of politics in UP”, the politics of positive agenda and people’s issues.“We need to steer the politics of UP and the country into a more positive direction, and on the issues that concern the people. Look at the level of our health spending, our education expenditure. It is much easier to mobilise people on hate. It is difficult to mobilise them on positive agendas. We need constructive discussions and I am happy to be a part of that dialogue,” Priyanka said, adding that the Congress’ decision to field women was not aimed at creating new vote banks. “Women are 50 per cent of our population and have every right to contest elections,” she said, adding that the Congress would support “other parties post elections” to keep the BJP out of power in UP.The Congress list includes several people seen protesting against the UP Government in recent years. It includes Unnao rape victim’s mother Asha Singh (fielded from Unnao); anti-CAA and NRC activist Sadaf Jafar (Lucknow Central); Raj Ram Gond (Obra) of Sonbhadra, where 11 tribals were killed in 2019 clashes over a piece of land.Also on the list is ASHA worker Poonam Pandey, who has been demanding a raise in the remuneration of the community health workers. She will contest from Shahjahanpur.Alpana Nishad, who has been actively articulating the issues of UP’s boatmen, has been fielded from Allahabad South and Ritu Singh, who was allegedly assaulted by BJP workers when she went to file her nomination for a block president’s election in UP, will fight from Mohammadi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anti-caa-activist-on-up-congress-first-list-361033

The failure of the respondent to obtain the occupation certificate is a deficiency in service for which the respondent is liable. The members of the cooperative housing society were well within their rights as ‘consumers’ to seek compensation for the lapse on the part of the builder”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-failure-to-obtain-occupation-certificate-deficiency-in-service-361042
