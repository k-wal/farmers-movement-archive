All injuries were ante-mortem, fresh before death, caused by blunt trauma/surface impact and could be sustained in a road traffic accident,” said the autopsy report.The accused constable had also sustained injuries and was hospitalised, a senior police officer had said earlier.A case under IPC sections 279 (rash and negligent driving) and 304A (causing death by negligence) was registered against the constable, police said, adding further investigation is underway.The deceased, who lost his father to Covid six months ago, is survived by wife, 10-year-old son and mother who live in Delhi’s Budh Vihar, they said. —                                     #DelhiPolice                                     #SalilTripathi                                     #Zomato||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-mortem-report-reveals-delivery-executive-suffered-grievous-injuries-on-head-chest-police-362392
18-01-2022||London||Mallya can be evicted from London home over unpaid loan, UK court orders||Embattled businessman Vijay Mallya on Tuesday lost a legal battle to hold on to his plush London home after a British court refused to grant him a stay of enforcement in a long-running dispute with Swiss bank UBS.The 18/19 Cornwall Terrace luxury apartment overlooking Regent’s Park in London, described in court as an “extraordinarily valuable property worth many tens of millions of pounds”, is currently being occupied by Mallya’s 95-year-old mother Lalitha.Delivering his judgment virtually for the Chancery Division of the High Court, Deputy Master Matthew Marsh concluded there were no grounds for him to grant further time for the Mallya family to repay a GBP 20.4-million loan to UBS – the claimant in the case.“The claimant’s position was a reasonable one… further time is not likely to make any material difference,” Deputy Master Marsh ruled.“I would also add from my review of the correspondence, I can see no basis whatever for the suggestion that has been made that the claimant has misled the first defendant [Vijay Mallya]… in conclusion, I dismiss the first defendant’s application,” he said.The judge also declined permission to appeal against his order or to grant a temporary stay of enforcement, which means UBS can proceed with the possession process to realise its unpaid dues.“I will refuse permission to appeal and therefore it follows that I will not be granting a stay,” said Marsh.Mallya’s barrister, Daniel Margolin QC, indicated that the 65-year-old businessman plans to pursue an appeal before a High Court Chancery Division Judge as it has “serious consequences” for his clients, including Mallya’s elderly mother who currently resides at the address.Meanwhile, Fenner Moeran QC made it clear that UBS intends to proceed with the enforcement order without delay.The case relates to a mortgage taken out by Rose Capital Ventures, one of Mallya’s companies, with the former Kingfisher Airlines boss, his mother Lalitha and son Sidhartha Mallya listed as co-defendants with right of occupancy of the property.In May 2019, Judge Simon Barker had handed down a consent order allowing the family to retain possession with a final deadline of April 30, 2020, granted for repayment of the loan. That deadline failed to be met and with special rules in place over the COVID-19 pandemic period, UBS was legally unable to pursue enforcement until April 2021.When the bank sought a court order for enforcement in October last year, Mallya filed an application of stay on the grounds that the bank had placed “unreasonable obstacles” in his path to repay the sums through family trust funds. His legal team also produced a non-binding letter claiming a company was willing to acquire the property, which would help pay off the loan.However, Deputy Master Marsh concluded that the letter was of “limited assistance” and expressed “real doubts about the bonafide of that offer”.Under the May 2019 order, UBS had been granted an “immediate right to possession” and Mallya and the co-defendants were not permitted to make any further applications to “postpone or suspend the date for giving up possession”.The court order also forbade any further claims arising out of the bankruptcy proceedings against Mallya by a consortium of Indian banks led by State Bank of India (SBI), proceedings which concluded in a bankruptcy order in July last year.Meanwhile, Mallya is wanted in India to face charges of fraud and money laundering amounting to an alleged Rs 9,000 crores related to loans made to his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.The former United Breweries chief remains on bail in the UK while a “confidential” legal matter, believed to be related to an asylum application, is resolved following separate extradition proceedings. —                                     #London                                     #UBS                                     #UK                                     #VijayMallya||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mallya-can-be-evicted-from-london-home-over-unpaid-loan-uk-court-orders-362391
18-01-2022||Varanasi (UP)||PM Modi says love he has got from Varanasi unprecedented||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said though he did not have the fortune to be born in Varanasi, he was able to associate himself with the holy city with the blessings of Lord Mahadev.Modi, who represents Varanasi in Lok Sabha, made the remarks during an interaction with BJP workers of his parliamentary constituency in Uttar Pradesh.Speaking to party worker Ashutosh Sharma, Modi said, “There is Mahadev in your name. Due to the blessings of Mahadev, I have been able to have the honour of associating myself with Varanasi. I did not have the honour of being born in Varanasi, but have the honour of being associated with Varanasi... The love that I have got from Varanasi is unprecedented.”  Lord Shiva is also called Mahadev and Ashutosh by devotees.Sharma told the prime minister how new flyovers have ensured smooth movement of vehicles in the city and reduced traffic jams.To this, Modi said, “Development happens where there is good connectivity. It has been our efforts that the heritage of the city should be preserved and development ensured at a fast pace.”Interacting with another party worker, Seema Kumari, the prime minister spoke in Bhojpuri dialect and said, “The support of sisters like you is my real power. If you are happy, then your family is happy, and the country is also happy.”  “Is the ‘maatrishkati’ (women) feeling happy?” Modi asked, to which Seema Kumari responded that they are feeling very much happy.Seema Kumari said people in her village have benefitted from various welfare schemes of the government.Modi subsequently said, “You are saying that I have done these things. I say that the mothers and sisters of the country have taken a wise decision and gave us an opportunity to serve (the people), hence these things could be done. In the last seven years, our effort has been to see that the dignity of women increases.”  He also asked every worker of the BJP to link more and more women with self-help groups, banks and digital payments, and added, “This will be a very big task.” Shravan Kumar Rawat thanked the prime minister for the renovation of Kashi Vishwanath Dhaam, the beautification work and how it will benefit traders, and termed Modi an “itihaas purush (iconic man)”.To this, Modi said, “All this have been done with the ‘kripaa’ (benevolence) of Baba (Lord Mahadev). He has made all of us a medium. I will tell every BJP worker that we should not leave any opportunity to serve the people. In every ‘kan kan’ (particle) of Varanasi, Mahadev Shankar himself resides.”  Modi also told Rawat that people who come from other places to Varanasi should be taken to Kabir Chaura and the temple of Sant Ravidas.Speaking to Manoj Kumar Patel, another party worker, Modi said that his government has taken various measures for farmers and laid emphasis making them aware about various opportunities in farming.“Farmers have to be told repeatedly because until he is convinced...he will not accept new things. I would want that the farmers should be told about natural farming. To save Mother Earth, to make farming chemical-free and to reduce the expenses on farming, boosting natural farming is very much necessary,” he said.The prime minister spoke to eight booth-level chiefs from eight assembly constituencies of Varanasi and around 10,000 workers virtually joined the audio interaction. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-says-love-he-has-got-from-varanasi-unprecedented-362386
18-01-2022||New Delhi||Centre proposes new rules to ensure availability of sufficient number of IAS officers for deputation||The Personnel Ministry has decided to amend existing service rules to ensure the availability of a sufficient number of IAS officers for central deputation, officials said on Tuesday.The proposal which will give greater say to the Centre came as various state/joint cadres were found to be not sponsoring an adequate number of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers as part of the central deputation reserve even though the ministry had flagged the issue several times.“As a result of this, the number of officers available for central deputation is not sufficient to meet the requirement at Centre,” the Personnel Ministry said in the proposal seeking changes in the IAS (cadre) Rules, 1954.The move has evoked sharp criticism from West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee who has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to roll back the proposal claiming it will affect states’ administration.“I express my strong reservations to the approach followed by the central government in proposing such amendment to the Cadre Rules which unilaterally mandates the state government to make such a number of officers available for deputation as prescribed under (the) central deputation reserve,” Banerjee wrote to Modi on Tuesday evening.Seeking to change the rules, the Centre has proposed that each state government shall make available for deputation to the central government such a number of eligible officers of various levels to the extent of the Central Deputation Reserve prescribed under existing regulations, adjusted proportionately by the number of officers available with the state government concerned vis-à-vis the total authorised strength of the state cadre at a given point of time.The actual number of officers to be deputed to the central government shall be decided by the central government in consultation with the state government concerned, the new rule proposes.In case of any disagreement, the matter shall be decided by the central government and the state government or state governments concerned shall give effect to the decision of the central government “within a specified time”, it has proposed.Existing rules did not mention any time limit for deciding on such disagreement.The proposal to change the rules was sent to the chief secretaries of all the state governments on December 20, 2021. They were asked to furnish their comments by January 5, 2022.The Centre had in June last year asked all state governments to nominate more officers for central deputation at the level of deputy secretary, director and joint secretary, citing their shortage.Officers of the level of deputy secretary/director and above are usually appointed in central government ministries/ departments (i.e. on central deputation) under the Central Staffing Scheme (CSS).Every cadre – a state/states or states and union territories—is allowed a deputation reserve to ensure that officers have the opportunity to work on deputation including that under the Central Staffing Scheme, which adds to their experience.It is requested that a larger number of officers may kindly be recommended for the appointment at DS/Director/JS level under the Central Staffing Scheme so that the central deputation reserve/ deputation reserves are duly utilised for this purpose, the Personnel Ministry had said in a communique. —                                     #Centre                                     #IAS                                     #MamataBanerjee||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-proposes-new-rules-to-ensure-availability-of-sufficient-number-of-ias-officers-for-deputation-362385
18-01-2022||---||No Republic Day chief guest for second successive year||New Delhi, January 18Soaring Covid cases in India have put paid to plans to invite the five Presidents of Central Asian states as Chief Guests for Republic Day, said sources though there was no official word from the Ministry of External Affairs.Truncated Republic Day celebrations this year are yet another casualty of in-person diplomatic interactions due to another wave of the pandemic. Prime Minister Narendra Modi cancelled his visit to the UAE and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to Vietnam for the same reason. The Prime Ministers of Russia and Nepal also called off their visits following the postponement of the Vibrant Gujarat summit.Instead, the five Central Asian leaders will take part in a virtual summit with PM Modi on Republic Day to celebrate 30 years of establishment of ties.This is the second year in a row when Covid has led to no overseas Chief Guest at the Republic Day parade.The exponential rise in cases in the UK in January last year forced its Prime Minister Boris Johnson to call off his visit to India as the Chief Guest.With pandemic-induced disruptions in one country or the other becoming the norm, diplomats and entrepreneurs have already taken to virtual conversations in a big way.The visit of the Central Asian leaders would have capped intensive engagements that began during PM Modi’s first term and gathered pace in recent times following the takeover of Kabul by the Taliban.                                     #Covid                                     #Modi                                     #pandemic                                     #Republicday||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-republic-day-chief-guest-for-second-successive-year-362380
18-01-2022||Vibha SharmaNew Delhi||UP: BJP works on seat-sharing with allies, ‘tweaks strategy’||The BJP, which announced two more candidates for the upcoming Assembly elections to Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday, is believed to have “almost finalised” the seat-sharing formula with existing allies, the Apna Dal and the Nishad Party, which appear to be seeking a better deal than the last time, according to sources.   While the BJP is believed to have decided around “18 seats for the Apna Dal and 12-15 for the Nishad Party”, the two allies are said to be angling for more. The Apna Dal, which contested 11 seats last time, is demanding as many as 36 seats, say sources. So far, the BJP has announced 109 candidates for the 403-member Uttar Pradesh assembly. The central leadership, which on Tuesday discussed probable candidates for the remaining phases and seat-sharing with alliance partners, is also said to be working on some change in the strategy. While Home Minister Amit Shah will be undertaking an extensive tour of the state beginning January 22, almost taking the command in his hand, the source say the party has decided to be “more generous with allies and some of the incumbent legislators, who would have otherwise been axed, might also be repeated”.While the BJP had earlier planned to change anywhere between 100 to 150 sitting MLAs, the “re-think in strategy” seems to be guided by the recent exodus of key OBC leaders, including three ministers, from the Adityanath Cabinet. The party is now considering limiting this number to 40/50 even though internal surveys have suggested a bigger change to tackle the anti-incumbency factor and a resurgent Samajwadi party, say the sources.So far, in the first two phases, the BJP has dropped 20 sitting MLAs.The leadership is also taking all care to keep the caste arithmetic and balance intact by giving due representation to all castes, including Brahmins, OBCs, and SCs. The fact that some seats are yet to be announced in western UP appears to be an indication of adjustments with some local players there in mind the SP-RLD candidates.                                     #allies                                     #ApnaDal                                     #BJP                                     #NishadParty                                     #seatsharing                                     #UP                                     #UPPolls                                     #UPpolls2022                                     #UttarPradesh                                     #YogiAdityanath||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-bjp-works-on-seat-sharing-with-allies-tweaks-strategy-362379
18-01-2022||Kolkata||Tableau row: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh writes to CMs Mamata Banerjee, MK Stalin||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh wrote to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin as the exclusion of the two states’ proposed tableaus from this year’s Republic Day snowballed into a major controversy.Rajnath wrote to Banerjee informing her that the CPWD’s float for the occasion pays homage to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on his 125th birth anniversary but her TMC was implacable, saying the state’s “dignity has been hurt”.In his letter, Singh hinted since the Central Public Works Department’s tableau already featured Bose, West Bengal’s float was not included for the parade, without saying it in so many words.“Our government had celebrated in 2018 with great fanfare the 75th anniversary of the government Netaji formed in exile in 1943. It was our government which included the living soldiers of the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army) in the Republic Day Parade and felicitated them,” Singh said.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, Banerjee had expressed “shock” at the rejection of the state’s tableau, themed on Bose and his Indian National Army. It also featured other Bengal icons like Rabindranath Tagore, Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar, Swami Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo.Banerjee, while urging the prime minister to reconsider the decision, said it will cause “pain” to the people of West Bengal if not retracted. She had said no reason was put forth for rejecting the tableau.Anita Bose Pfaff, the only child of Bose, had said on Monday the legendary freedom fighter’s legacy has often been “partly exploited” for political reasons.She minced no words while acknowledging the fanfare that marked the start of the 125th birth anniversary year celebrations of Bose in 2021 in Kolkata had something to do with the elections in West Bengal.“The opening of the anniversary year was celebrated in a bigger way, of all places in Kolkata, had something to do with election and election prospects in Bengal. The fact that nothing happened this year....certainly the issue is not as important as last year,” she had told PTI in an exclusive interview.TMC Secretary General and West Bengal minister Partha Chatterjee reacted sharply to Singh’s letter and tweets by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighting that an expert committee of eminent personalities shortlists the tableau proposals sent by states, central ministries and public sector units. “The Centre has hurt the dignity of Bengal, which has been the frontrunner of the freedom movement and is the birthplace of Netaji....So much effort and research went behind the tableau but it has been summarily rejected without any reason because of political considerations. They have ignored the history of freedom struggle which is incomplete without Bengal,” he said.A Ministry of Defence (MoD) official’s comments in New Delhi that the decision to not include the tableaux of Kerala, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu at the Republic Day parade will not be revised further angered the TMC, which called the decision an “insult” to the people of West Bengal. All three states have non-BJP governments.“Existing criteria and proposals for selection were scrupulously followed. Since @narendramodi became @PMOIndia : 2018 & 2021: Kerala’s tableau selected.  2016, 2017, 2019, 2020 & 2021: Tamil Nadu selected  2016, 2017, 2019 & 2021: West Bengal selected,” she wrote on Twitter.“Incidentally, this year the tableau of  @CPWDGOV includes Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. Stop seeing bad politics in a display that celebrates India,” she added.All India Forward Bloc, the party founded by the fabled freedom fighter, also reacted angrily to the exclusion of West Bengal’s tableau highlighting the contributions of Bose.“Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s legacy should not be seen through the prism of centre-state politics. The Centre should have a clear policy regarding the representation of states at the Republic Day parade. It can’t be whims and fancies of the BJP leaders and some bureaucrats,” Debabrata Biswas, its general secretary, said.Bose had launched the AIFB in 1939.“It seems the Centre doesn’t want to propagate the ideal of the Netaji and that is why it was not keen on allowing West Bengal’s tableau. We had earlier demanded that Netaji’s life and struggle should be included in the school texts but the Centre did nothing,” he said.Netaji’s grandnephew Chandra Kumar Bose, however, thanked the Centre for its decision to include CPWD’s float on Bose at the Republic Day parade.“People of our great nation appreciate Government of India is making a Netaji tableau for the Republic Day parade 2022. But there was no harm in allowing the state government’s tableau too. However, the real tribute to Netaji would be to follow and implement his inclusive ideology to unite all communities as Bharatiyas to take the country forward,” he said.Due process followed, Rajnath Singh writes to StalinRajnath Singh said in his letter to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin that the selection was “as per the prescribed guidelines”.The letter comes a day after Stalin wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi complaining about the exclusion of his state’s model.In a letter to Modi, Stalin said the rejection was “disappointing” and would deeply hurt the sentiments and patriotic feelings of the people of the state.Responding to Stalin, the defence minister wrote a letter to the chief minister saying the proposal from Tamil Nadu was considered in the first three rounds of selection meetings but could not make it into the final list of 12 tableaux selected for participation in the RDP-2022.“There exists a well-established system for selection of tableaux for participation in the Republic Day parade, as per which, the Ministry of Defence invites proposals for tableaux from all states/union territories and central ministries/departments,” Singh said.The tableaux proposals received from various states, union territories, central ministries and departments are evaluated in a series of meetings of an expert committee comprising eminent persons in the field of art, culture, painting, sculpture, music, architecture, choreography, etc, the minister added.“The expert committee examines the proposals on the basis of theme, concept, design and its visual impact before making its recommendations,” he noted.As per the time slot allotted for tableaux in the overall duration of the parade, shortlisting of tableaux is done by the expert committee, he mentioned.For RDP-2022 (Republic Day parade-2022), a total of 29 proposals were received from states and union territories including from Tamil Nadu, he said.“The tableaux from the state government of Tamil Nadu was considered in the first three rounds of meetings. After the third round of meeting, the tableaux could not make it into the final list of 12 tableaux selected for participation in the RDP-2022,” Singh stated.However, during the last few years, the tableaux from Tamil Nadu has been selected for participation in RDP-2017, RDP-2019, RDP-2020 and RDP-2021, Singh noted.“In view of the above details, you would appreciate that the selection of tableaux is as per the prescribed guidelines on the matter,” he saidThe Kerala government had on Friday protested the exclusion of its tableau depicting social reformer Sree Narayana Guru.                                       #MamataBaerjee                                     #MKStalin                                     #Netaji                                     #Rajnath                                     #Republicday                                     #RepublicDayrow                                     #tableau                                     #tableaurow                                     #tamilnadu                                     #TMC                                     #WestBengal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tableau-row-defence-minister-rajanath-singh-writes-to-cms-mamata-banerjee-mk-stalin-362376
18-01-2022||---||Why woman cadets’ intake in NDA restricted to only 19: SC asks Centre||New Delhi, January 18The Supreme Court Tuesday sought to know from the Centre in three weeks as to why the intake of female cadets in the National Defence Academy (NDA) has been restricted to only 19 this year.“The figure is the same as for the 2021 test. Last year, you said that it was due to infrastructure problems that the intake of women will be less. Now, again for the year 2022, you have proposed to take the same number of women candidates. Why have you fixed this figure? You have to explain this. Nineteen seats can’t be for all times to come. It was only an ad hoc measure,” said a Bench led by Justice SK Kaul.The top court had on September 22 last year permitted female candidates to appear for the NDA Exam for the first time.On October 7, it also allowed female candidates to appear in the examination for Rashtriya Indian Military College (RIMC), Dehradun.Asking Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati to place on record the total number of candidates, including women, who appeared in the NDA Examination 2021 and for RIMC and Rashtriya Military School (RMS) entrance tests, the top court posted matter for further hearing on March 6.Bhati said the intake of female candidates in the NDA, RIMC and RMS didn’t only depend on infrastructure but on several other factors, including the requirement of defence forces.Maintaining that it understood not all fields were open to women in defence forces, the Bench said there will not be an equal number of men and women as of now and it will take time.On behalf of petitioner Kush Kalra, senior advocate Chinmoy Pradip Sharma said as per the advertisement issued by the UPSC, the NDA will take in 400 cadets in the current NDA-II 2021 intake.“Of these, 208 candidates, including 10 women, will go to the Army. The Navy will take in 42 candidates including 3 women, while the IAF will admit 120 candidates, of which 6 will be women. Thus, the total number of women to be inducted into the NDA in June 2022 is 19,” Sharma said.Sharma said it can be seen from the reading of the Examination Notice December 22, 2021 that the number of women candidates to be inducted in January 2023 continues to remain at 19.He said that in the affidavit dated September 20, 2021 filed by the Centre, it has been categorically stated that necessary steps will be in place by May of this year itself (2022).“Furthermore, for the first time it is mentioned that the intake in the Naval Academy is for 30 male candidates only. The said restriction is arbitrary,” he submitted.In the NDA exam held on November 14 last year 8,009 candidates qualified for the Service Selection Board test as also medical tests, out of which 1,002 candidates were women and 7,007 men, Sharma said.                                     #Army                                     #Defence                                     #NDA                                     #SupremeCourt                                     #womancadets||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-woman-cadets-intake-in-nda-restricted-to-only-19-sc-asks-centre-362375

I request you to keep the federal spirit of the Cadre Rules unviolated by withdrawing/not giving effect to the proposed amendment,” she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/proposal-to-change-rules-for-central-deputation-of-ias-officers-will-affect-states-administration-mamata-to-pm-362372

18-01-2022||Kathmandu||Nepal’s Province 2 bordering India named ‘Madhes Pradesh’||Nepal’s south-eastern Province 2 bordering India has been named Madhes Pradesh with Janakpur retained as its capital, settling a long-standing debate on the region’s official reference after it was made a province in 2015.The Provincial Assembly on Monday voted in two-thirds majority for both decisions. Of the 99 voting members, 78 voted for Janakpur as capital and 80 voted for the provincial name Madhes.Madhes is Nepal’s smallest province in terms of area but second largest in terms of population. It borders India (Bihar) in the south and has eight districts -- Bara, Parsa, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Mahottari, Dhanusha, Siraha and Saptari.Majority of the population in the region is of Indian descent and Maithili is the most widely spoken language.Senior Lokatantrik Samajwadi Party leader Rajendra Mahato said the new province name is a milestone in Nepal moving towards complete federalism, with the identity of Madhesis.Colloquially Madhesi means people from the southern plains. In Hindu religious text, Madesh refers to Lord Shiva.Province 2, or Madhes Pradesh now, was formed after Nepal’s new Constitution came into effect in September 2015, turning the country into a ‘Federal Democratic Republic’.Before attaining provincial status, Madhesi parties had extensively campaigned for greater rights, representation and autonomy. Nearly 50 people had died in agitations between September 2015 and February 2016.The provincial government declared a public holiday on Tuesday to mark the occasion.Janata Samajbadi Party Chairperson Upendra Yadav said that naming Province 2 as Madhes Province has honoured the Madhes movement.“The sacrifice of Madhes people and their dream is reflected in the naming of the province as Madhes. We’re happy to have this name for our province,” he said addressing a celebration program on Monday.Minister for Physical Infrastructures and Transport, Renu Kumari Yadav, also said the dispute entrenched for long on naming the province has now ended. “We are proud of Madhes Province,” she said.The province got its name nearly four years after the provincial assembly election. Of the seven provinces in Nepal, only Province 1 remains to be named.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/nepals-province-2-bordering-india-named-madhes-pradesh-362364

He expressed condolences for the Indian lives lost in the terror attack in UAE yesterday,” Jaishankar said in a tweet.“Conveyed our strong solidarity with UAE in face of such unacceptable acts. Our Embassy is working with UAE authorities to provide the fullest support to families of the deceased,” he added.The identities of the two Indian nationals killed in Monday’s suspected drone attacks near the Abu Dhabi airport that sparked multiple explosions in the capital of the United Arab Emirates have been established, the Indian embassy said on Tuesday.It also said there were two Indians among the six people injured in the attacks and both were discharged on Monday night after medical treatment.The explosions were caused by “small flying objects”, possibly drones, that hit three petroleum tankers in Abu Dhabi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uae-foreign-minister-calls-up-jaishankar-condoles-loss-of-indian-lives-in-terror-attack-in-his-country-362362

The time was till today (Tuesday) for the leader whom I had approached for an alliance to stop the BJP. I announce this today that we are not going with them (SP). Now, even if they offer us 100 seats we will not tie-up with them because it’s a matter of self-respect,” Azad told reporters.On Yadav saying he would extend support to the ASP, the flamboyant Dalit leader said he is a lawyer by education and understands well the difference in the language of support and taunt, in a veiled attack on the SP president who had offered two seats to the ASP recently.He said workers and activists of the Bhim Army, a Dalit outfit he founded, and the ASP are strong enough to compete in the polls and have a reach at village level.“It is true that we are open to forming tie-ups with other parties. Around 50 small outfits are sitting at our office now as we speak but we have come for the press conference here since it was pre-scheduled,” Azad claimed.He added that ASP will not field candidates against the RLD, which has a tie-up with the SP for the UP polls because of respect for the Jayant Chaudhary-led party, which had offered the ASP the two seats that Yadav was talking about.Elections to the 403 seats of the UP Assembly will take place in seven phases, beginning February 10. The results will be announced on March 10. —                                     #AazadSamajParty                                     #BhimArmy                                     #ChandrashekharAzad                                     #Dalit                                     #UPelections                                     #UPPolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wont-tie-up-with-sp-even-for-100-seats-now-chandrashekhar-azad-362360

How long will this go on?,” the DCW chief asked through social media.Maliwal further stated that she feels outraged over the fact that such incidents are increasing in the country.“Strongest action needs to be taken against the culprits and that’s why I have issued a notice to Delhi Police seeking immediate FIR and arrests in the matter,” the DCW chief added. —IANS                                     #Clubhouse                                     #ClubhouseApp                                     #DCW                                     #Muslimwomen                                     #SwatiMaliwal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/obscene-remarks-against-muslim-women-on-clubhouse-app-dcw-seeks-fir-362358
18-01-2022||New Delhi||Centre flags decline in Covid testing, asks states to enhance it||Flagging a decline in the number of Covid-19 tests in many states and union territories, the Centre has asked them to enhance testing so that an effective track of the spread of the pandemic can be kept and immediate citizen-centric action can be initiated.In a letter to states and UTs on Monday, Additional Secretary in the Union Health Ministry Arti Ahuja advised them to pay attention to this aspect immediately and increase the testing in a strategic manner keeping in view the trend of case positivity in specific areas.She highlighted that Omicron, which has been designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a variant of concern, is currently spreading across the country.Referring to the ministry’s earlier letters and the Home Ministry advisory of December 27 last year laying out the broad framework of pandemic management in the context of Omicron, Ahuja said testing remains a key and crucial component.“However, it is seen from the data available on the ICMR portal that testing has declined in many states and union territories,” she wrote.She said in all advisories on testing issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), including the latest on January 10, the basic objective remains early detection of cases for quick isolation and care.In addition, testing remains a key strategy for pandemic management as it helps in identification of new clusters and new hotspots of infection which can in turn facilitate immediate action for containment such as setting up of containment zones, contact tracing, quarantining, isolation and follow-up.This can enable the state and district administrations to curb the spread of infection. Also this will ensure reduction in mortality and morbidity.“Progression of disease to a severe category can be averted by strategic testing of those who are at high risk and more vulnerable, as well as in areas where the spread is likely to be higher,” Ahuja said.Reiterating the advisory on purposive testing strategy issued by the ICMR on January 10, she said in community settings all those who are symptomatic must be tested and all at-risk contacts of laboratory confirmed cases must also be tested.This advisory needs to be read in conjunction with the earlier guidelines and advisories of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, wherein it has been recommended that strategic and focused testing should be done of people who are vulnerable, living in closed surroundings, in densely populated areas in emerging new clusters and new hotspots of positive cases, etc., Ahuja said.“In order to ensure that an effective track of the spread of the pandemic is kept and also immediate citizen-centric action is initiated, it is incumbent upon all states/UTs to enhance testing,” she said.India has so far recorded 3,76,18,271 coronavirus cases and 4,86,761 deaths due to it. On Tuesday, the country registered 2,38,018 new infections with a positivity rate of 14.43 per cent.                                     #Centre                                     #CovidTest                                     #HealthMinistry                                     #pandemic||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-flags-decline-in-covid-testing-asks-states-to-enhance-it-362350

So, we decided to perform the swab test on the animals,” the senior official said.“Animals, too, face health issues similar to humans. Last year, a lioness Kavitha (23), which was suspected to have died of coronavirus, suffered from cancer,” the official said. —                                     #Chennai                                     #leopardess                                     #lion                                     #VandalurZoo||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/leopardess-lion-die-in-squeeze-cage-at-chennais-vandalur-zoo-362349

This portion is not clear in the video live-streamed on PM’s YouTube channel.”After this, the PM questions if he and the interpreter can be heard properly, to which (WEF executive chairman) Klaus Schwab responds stating that he can.????????????? ?? ???? ?? ???? ??, ???? ???? ? ?? ?? ???? ??? ?? ??? ??? ? ???? pic.twitter.com/p75m9zXwMj  “However, Schwab interrupts the PM’s speech to give a brief introduction. The PM repeats the whole speech again,” Sinha said, recounting the events from Monday evening during the prime minister’s address.However, several Congress leaders took a dig at the prime minister over the incident.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “Teleprompter se bhashan chal sakta hai, shasan nahin. Kal ye poore desh ki samajh mein aa gaya (You can give a speech but not rule using a teleprompter. The whole country understood this yesterday).The Congress, on its official Twitter handle, shared the video of the prime minister taking a pause in his speech, calling him the “teleprompter guy”.Youth Congress tweeted, “Failed to address after teleprompter stopped working, PM Modi failed to represent the country on World Economic Forum!”In a tweet, BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga slammed those criticising the PM.“Don’t those getting excited at the tech glitch not realise that the problem was at WEF’s end? They were not able to patch PM, so requested him to start again, which is evident in the way Klaus Schwab said that he will again give a short introduction and then open up the session,” he said.Several other BJP leaders cited the same reason for the incident and some posted a video from the WEF’s YouTube channel, showing the sequence of events.According to the video and pointers along with it shared by BJP leaders, Prime Minister Modi’s speech started abruptly from the middle without English interpretation. The prime minister was interrupted by the co-ordinator who asked him to check if all had been connected, Schwab then started the official session and Modi again started his speech with English interpretation being shared.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modis-wef-address-rahul-takes-teleprompter-jibe-at-pm-bjp-leaders-cite-technical-glitch-362347
18-01-2022||New Delhi||EC adds new column for candidates to mention expenditure on digital campaigning||The Election Commission has added a new column in candidates’ election expenditure returns to submit information on money spent on digital campaigning in the upcoming polls in five states.The candidates used to mention money spent on digital campaigning in previous elections also, but this is for the first time that a dedicated column has been created to “capture” details of such expenditure.In a bid to check the spread of COVID-19, Election Commission has extended a ban on holding physical rallies roadshows and similar physical campaigning events till January 22.With the ban on outdoor physical events in place, parties are using digital and online platforms to reach out to voters.The new column has been created for the first time for elections in Uttar Pradesh Uttarakhand, Goa, Punjab and Manipur by tweaking the format of returns.“Parties and candidates (so far) used to disclose on their own such expenditure ... they used to provide details of expenditure on things like digital vans ... they used to show expenditure under this category. Now, a dedicated point has been created to capture such expenditure from this (set of) polls,” a functionary explained.The functionary said it is not for the first first time such disclosure by the candidates and parties will be made. “But the manner of disclosure now is dedicated,” the functionary explained.According to section 10A of the Representation of the People Act 1951, a candidate who fails to lodge his or her election expenditures within the prescribed time is liable to be disqualified by EC for a period of three years from contesting polls.Ahead of the announcement of the election schedule, the expenditure limit for candidates for campaigning was hiked by the government based on the recommendations of the poll panel.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ec-adds-new-column-for-candidates-to-mention-expenditure-on-digital-campaigning-362346
18-01-2022||---||Armed with SC verdict, Centre to fight out cases abroad on cancelled Antrix-Devas deal||New Delhi, January 18Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said the Government will contest the adverse international arbitration awards totaling over $ 1.1 billion filed by a company called Devas.“The loss will not be borne by the Modi government. It is now the Congress Party’s turn to explain how this was allowed, how the Cabinet was kept in the dark and how it took six years for the fraud to be cancelled. The Congress has no right to speak about crony capitalism,” said the Finance Minister while speaking about the complications resulting from joint venture Devas struck with Antrix, an ISRO company.A day earlier, the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal filed by Devas and upheld orders by Company Law tribunal’s order asking the promoters to wind up the company as the deal with Antrix was steeped in fraud.But Sitharaman’s ire was directed at the UPA regime for taking six years to cancel the Devas-Antrix deal as well as the ignominy suffered to India’s image after international courts ordered the seizing of government property abroad to implement arbitration awards of over $ 1.1 billion.Devas and its investors had approached the international arbitration panel after the UPA government had cancelled the Devas-Antrix joint venture over the stink it raised.Though Sitharaman only spoke of fighting the issue out and gave no details pending inter-Ministerial consultations, the Supreme Court terming the deal as fraud will be of assistance to the Government in its legal battles abroad where Devas is trying to enforce the arbitration awards by seeking the seizure of Indian assets such as those owned by Air India.The apex court had said on Monday that the commercial relationship between Antrix and Devas were a “product of fraud perpetrated by Devas, every part of the plant that grew out of those seeds, such as the agreement, the disputes, arbitral awards, etc., are all infected with the poison of fraud’’. It also noted how Devas brought in an investment of Rs. 579 crore but “siphoned off” Rs. 488 crore.Asked what the present government has done so far, Sitharaman said it was pursuing the company law cases through the courts and did not reply when asked if the arbitration courts would listen to the Government since no one has been convicted in the cases filed by the ED and CBI.However, a statement by Devas shareholders described the seizure of Air India’s assets in Canada as just a start. “Additional actions are forthcoming that will underscore that India is an unsafe place to invest in. Using government agencies to launch bogus criminal investigations against Devas will be seen around the world for what it is — an Indian government willing to debase the country’s reputation by lashing out at its victims rather than paying what it owes them,” it said.                                     #AntrixDevas                                     #artbitration                                     #Devas                                     #fraud                                     #nirmalasitharaman                                     #Sbandspectrum                                     #SC                                     #spectrum                                     #UPA||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-charges-congress-of-fraud-in-entering-into-antrix-devas-deal-cites-sc-judgment-362343

The same drug in two divided doses of one to two mg/kg can be given for same duration in severe cases.“Inhalational budesonide (given via metered dose inhaler/dry powder inhaler) at a dose of 800 mcg BD for five days can be given in mild cases if symptoms (fever and/or cough) are persistent beyond five days of disease onset,” it was stated in the guidelines.According to the guidance note, upper respiratory tract symptoms without shortness of breath or hypoxia has been categorised as mild disease and have been advised home isolation and care. Those suffering from mild Covid should seek medical attention if they have difficulty in breathing, high grade fever, or severe cough lasting for more than five days.Those having breathlessness with SpO2 fluctuating between 90-93 per cent, can get admitted to a ward, and they will be considered moderate cases.  Such patients should be given oxygen support and awake proning should be encouraged in all patients requiring supplemental oxygen therapy, in sequential position changes every two hours, the guidelines stated. Respiratory rate over 30 per minute, breathlessness or SpO2 lower than 90 per cent on room air should be considered as severe disease and such patients have to admitted to an ICU as they will need respiratory support, they said.Such patients should be put on respiratory support. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) -- helmet or face mask interface depending on availability—may be considered  in those with increasing oxygen requirements if work of breathing is low. High flow nasal cannula should be considered in patients with increasing oxygen requirements. Intubation should be prioritised in patients with high work of breathing if NIV is not tolerated and institutional protocol for ventilatory management should be used when required, the new guidelines stated.Those aged above 60 years, or those having cardiovascular disease, hypertension and coronary artery disease diabetes mellitus and other immunocompromised states, such as HIV, active tuberculosis, chronic lung, kidney or liver disease, cerebrovascular disease or obesity are at high risk for severe disease and mortality, the guidelines stated.                                      #corona                                     #coronavirus                                     #Covid                                     #guidelines                                     #HealthMinistry                                     #persistentcough                                     #revisedguidelines                                     #steroids                                     #TB                                     #tuberculosis||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/go-for-test-for-tb-other-conditions-if-cough-persists-for-more-than-2-3-weeks-revised-clinical-guidance-for-covid-patients-362338

The two were discharged on Monday night after medical treatment.On Monday, two Indians and a Pakistani national, all staff of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), were killed and six others injured in the attack claimed by Houthi rebels in Yemen.The explosions were caused by "small flying objects", possibly drones, that hit three petroleum tankers in Abu Dhabi.The embassy in Abu Dhabi said on Tuesday that the identities of the two deceased Indian nationals have been established.“@IndembAbuDhabi officials are in touch with their family members. The Mission is working closely with UAE authorities, including ADNOC, for early repatriation of mortal remains,” it tweeted.However, the embassy has not revealed their identities."Of the 6 injured, 2 are Indian nationals. After receiving the medical treatment they were discharged yesterday night. We thank the UAE Government @MoFAICUAE & @AdnocGroup for their support," the embassy tweeted.Speaking to The National newspaper on Monday, India's Ambassador to the UAE, Sunjay Sudhir, said the Indian government would provide “whatever assistance is possible” to the families of the two deceased Indian citizens.The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) on Monday tweeted," At approximately 10:00 AM this morning, an incident occurred at our Mussafah Fuel Depot in Abu Dhabi which resulted in the outbreak of a fire.

18-01-2022||Bhopal||Modi is incarnation of god born to end despair, says MP minister||Madhya Pradesh Agriculture Minister and BJP leader Kamal Patel termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi an "incarnation of God", saying he, like Lord Ram and Lord Krishna, was born to end the atmosphere of despair, created due to the rise in "atrocities" committed by the Congress, corruption, and the destruction of the country's culture.Speaking to reporters in Harda on Monday, Patel said the tasks accomplished by PM Modi like leading India on the path of becoming ‘Vishwa Guru’, ridding the country of corruption, and ensuring the public welfare wouldn't have been accomplished by an ordinary person.“Whenever any crisis descends on India and tyranny increases then it is said in our religion and culture that God takes avatar in a human form,” Patel said.He said Lord Ram had taken avatar in a human form and established 'Ramrajya' by killing demon Ravan and defeating other evil powers, and protecting the people. When Kansa's atrocities increased, Lord Krishna took birth and ended his cruelties thus giving relief to the common people, the minister said.“Similarly, when atrocities of the Congress increased…corruption, casteism rose, the culture of the country was destroyed and an atmosphere of despair was prevailing all around then Narendra Modi was born to end it,” Patel said.He said India is becoming a “Vishwa Guru” under the leadership of Modi “who has given a corruption-free government and also ensures the welfare of the common people”.“These are impossible tasks which a common man is not able to accomplish. It could have happened in 60 years, if possible. So, PM Narendra Modi ji is an 'Avatari Purush' (incarnate) and did impossible works. He is the incarnation of God,” Patel said.Interestingly, Patel last November had suggested that Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is incarnate of tribal icon Tantya Bhil, known in the tribal narrative as ‘Indian Robin Hood’.“Tantya mama used to facilitate marriages of girls. Our mama (as CM Chouhan is fondly called) also does the same. Tantya mama used to loot the rich and distribute the wealth among the poor. Our CM does not loot, but collects taxes from the rich and spends it for the poor. In a way, we can say that Tantya mama took rebirth as our CM Shivraj,” he had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-is-incarnation-of-god-born-to-end-despair-says-mp-minister-362298

A fire had also broken out at the under-construction extension of the Abu Dhabi airport.“Initial investigations found parts of a small plane that could possibly be a drone at both sites that could have caused the explosion and the fire. There was no significant damage,” said the Abu Dhabi police.But the incident was considered serious enough by South Korea that cancelled the summit meeting of its President Moon Jae-in with Abu Dhabi’s crown prince Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan due to “unforeseen and urgent matters of state”.A Houthi military spokesman lent credence to speculation about a drone attack by stating that the rebels launched a military operation “deep in the UAE”.Houthi Arabs have been targeting facilities in Saudi Arabia and the UAE for their military intervention in Yemen in 2015.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-indians-among-3-killed-in-houthi-led-uae-drone-attack-362109

The NCLT’s direction came over a petition filed by Antrix Corporation.The NCLAT had upheld the earlier order of the Bengaluru Bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which had on May 25, 2021, directed winding up of Devas Multimedia and appointed a provisional liquidator for the purpose.The NCLT had said Devas Multimedia was incorporated on December 17, 2004, with a fraudulent motive to collude and connive with the then officials of Antrix Corporation to get bandwidth from it by entering into an agreement in 2005, which was subsequently cancelled by the government.This order was challenged by Devas Multimedia and its shareholder Devas Employees Mauritius Private Limited before the Chennai Bench of NCLAT, which dismissed the petition.Devas maintained that the agreement intended to achieve innovation and as a result it introduced and utilised technologies like never before, generating huge revenue for Antrix.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-upholds-nclat-verdict-on-devas-362110

It does not mean that we will vote for them. We have decided that we (BKU) will not support anyone. Everyone (electorate) knows what they have to do,” Rakesh Tikait said.Message misreadThe video (of Naresh) has been misread. If someone comes to you, you do say ‘we are with you’ but it doesn’t mean we back them. —Rakesh Tikait, bkuInterestingly, Rakesh Tikait also said Yogi Adityanath “must win elections (from Gorakhpur) as we need a strong opposition in the state”.In the very first mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar during the farm agitation last year, Naresh had said the “mistake made by Jats and khaps” in 2019 by not supporting late RLD leader Ajit Singh would be rectified in the 2022 Assembly elections.In his last Lok Sabha elections from Muzaffarnagar, Ajit Singh had lost by a narrow margin to Balyan.The BKU, especially Rakesh Tikait, has played a key role in the year-long agitation against the now-repealed farm laws. According to Balyan, who belongs to the same khap (Balyan) as Tikait brothers, it was a courtesy call. “Naresh Tikait had undergone a medical procedure a few days ago. We are like family… we keep meeting often… I came here to enquire about his health. He is recovering well. We had a good meeting,” the BJP’s Muzaffarnagar MP said.A key part of the saffron strategy for poll-bound agrarian states Punjab, UP and Uttarakhand is to make amends with the politically significant and apparently still-upset Jat community by reaching out to their leaders.Though BJP leaders claim that all khaps in western UP will support the party like they had in the 2014, 2017 and 2019 elections. “Jats are very happy with Yogi, they will not forget what happened in 2013 (Muzaffarnagar riots),” state BJP spokesperson Anila Singh said.So far, both Samyukt Kisan Morcha and the BKU have refrained from promoting any political party. The SKM has also warned of launching ‘Mission UP’ (against the BJP) from February 1 if the Centre failed to fulfil its promises. “We will observe January 31 as ‘Vishwasghat Diwas’ (betrayal day) and hold nationwide protests,” the SKM has warned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bku-wont-back-any-party-clarifies-rakesh-tikait-362113

However, no person can be forced to be vaccinated against their wishes.”The Union Health Ministry submitted that “the direction released by the Government of India did not envisage any forcible vaccination without consent of the individual”.Meanwhile, Dr Jacob Puliyel, former member of the National Technical Advisory Group of Immunisation, has moved the top court challenging the vaccine mandates issued by the governments of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.Dr Puliyel, who urged the court to issue directions to publicise the data of clinical trials of vaccines administered to children, said the Centre has said vaccination was voluntary and can’t be mandated at this stage. Contending that children were incapable of legal consent to the vaccines, he said the parents who gave consent on their behalf were incapable of giving “informed consent” in the absence of studies.Vaccination for 12-14 likely from MarchNew Delhi: India may begin inoculating children in the 12-14 age group against Covid-19 in March as the 15-18 population is likely to get fully vaccinated by then, Dr NK Arora, chairman of the Covid-19 working group of NTAGI, said on Monday.

Also, a model of the Gnat fighter aircraft will form the display. The Gnat had earned the name ‘Sabre Slayer’ for its efficacy in shooting down Sabres, a name for Pakistan Air Force jet.The flypast will pay homage to two important events that possibility changed the course of the 1971 war in the Eastern Theatre. Among the several formations that will be flying, the IAF has named two of the flying displays as ‘Tangail’ and ‘Meghna’.Tangail is the place in Bangladesh where the Indian Army’s Parachute Regiment personnel were airdropped behind enemy lines. A Dakota, a plane used for para-dropping in 1971, will fly past the Rajpath as part of the flying display. It will be flanked by two Dornier 228 planes. This segment of the display is named Tangail.Meghna is a river east of Dhaka and crossing it was important during the 1971 war if Indian forces wanted to capture the city. IAF helicopters were used to cross thousands of Indian Army troops across the 4 km expanse of the Meghna. The flying display at Rajpath will commemorate that event. A Chinook heavy-lift helicopter and four Mi17V5 helicopters will fly in at the fly-past and the segment is named Meghna.The flypast will conclude with seven jaguar fighter jets flying in the formation of numerical ‘75’ in the air. “The flypast this year will be the grandest and largest with 75 aircraft from the IAF, Army and the Navy,” said Western Air Command spokesperson Wing Commander Indranil Nandi.Among the other aircraft that will be on display are the Rafale, the Indian Navy’s MiG29K, P-8I surveillance aircraft and Jaguar jets, besides the Russian Mi-17V5 helicopters, locally made Advanced Light helicopter and the US-made C-130 special operations plane.Significance of the two events Tangail: It’s is the place in Bangladesh where the Indian Army’s Parachute Regiment personnel were airdropped behind enemy linesMeghna: It’s a river east of Dhaka and crossing it was important during the 1971 war if Indian forces wanted to capture the cityLargest flypast with 75 aircraftThe Republic Day parade this year will see the ‘grandest and largest’ flypast ever with the participation of 75 aircraft to mark the Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav celebrations.

Senior leaders quoted the case of Utpal Parrikar, son of late leader Manohar Parrikar, who has been seeking the BJP ticket from Panaji which his father represented for several years.“The BJP is clear...no one is bigger than the party,” they said Harak Singh is believed to have been seeking at least “three” tickets. Dhami said: “We have decided not to give ticket to more than one person from a family.”Meanwhile, Harak Singh accused the BJP of removing him without speaking to him. Predicting Congress victory, Harak Singh said: “They (BJP) did not talk to me once before taking such a big decision.”He’s welcome to join cong: Harish RawatCongress’ campaign chairman for Uttarakhand Harish Rawat on Monday set a condition for welcoming expelled BJP minister Harak Singh Rawat into the grand old party fold. “I don’t want to say much on this issue. The matter of inducting Harak Singh into the party is yet to be debated.

18-01-2022||Nonika Singh||Kathak king took art to higher plane with matchless grace, fluidity||He epitomised dance in every pore of his being. Kathak doyen Brij Mohan Nath Mishra, popularly known as Pandit Birju Maharaj, an exponent of the Kalka-Bindadin gharana of Lucknow and recipient of India’s second highest civilian honour Padma Vibhushan, breathed his last on Monday. But the life and energy he enthused into the dance form will always remain unmatched.Also read: He blended aestheticism into KathakBorn into a family of artistes, tracing their lineage to generations of performing arts, he was trained not only by his father maestro Acchan Maharaj, whom he lost when he was barely nine, but equally influenced by his renowned uncles Shambhu Maharaj and Lacchu Maharaj. He would call it “triveni” of influence, “Ganga, Jamuna, Saraswati coming together in me.” Katha kahey so kathak kehlaaye… Kathak, the dance form of story-telling with its natural postures, he opined was organically open to innovations. Only he lent new expression to this evocative dance form sans gimmickry.From full-length mythological and historical dance-dramas such as Katha Raghunath Ki, Krishnayan, Darbar-e-Salaami and Shaahi Mehfil, he naturally moved to abstract compositions such as Naad Gunjan, Ghunghru Sangeet and Laya Parikrama.Dancer, poet, painter, singer and percussionist, he felt at home in all art forms and dubbed them as his “relatives”. No wonder, he was in perfect unison while performing with other artistes, be it flamenco dancers, ghazal singer Jagjit Singh, tabla maestro Ustad Zakir Hussain or Thumri queen Girija Devi.Nature for him was the biggest dancer of all in which every being resonated with a rhythmic sensibility. Only he sought rhythm even in inanimate objects and created dance pieces around nebulous concepts like editing too. His mathematical tihaais became a new lesson in the lexicon of Kathak.As brilliant a performer as adept a teacher; he taught at the Shriram Bharatiya Kala Kendra and the Sangeet Natak Akademi’s Kathak Kendra from where he retired in 1998. Later, he started his own dance school Kalashram. He may have trained many superstars like Madhuri Dixit (Devdas) and Deepika Padukone (Bajirao Mastani), but he will always be the undisputed superstar of Kathak.He may have deemed that women dancers are endowed with natural beauty and male dancers have to work twice as hard to achieve the same grace. But he defied gender binaries, enraptured one and all as he became Radha on stage with effortless ease and fluidity.To remain a student till his last breath was his wistful desire. His inimitable dancing style that imbibed tradition and innovation in equal measure would be a referral point for generations to come.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kathak-king-took-art-to-higher-plane-with-matchless-grace-fluidity-362132
18-01-2022||New Delhi||Time to invest in India is now, PM Modi tells WEF||Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a gathering of world’s business and political leaders that this is the best time for investment in India.Pointing out that in the economic arena, India is moving forward with some encouraging results, he said at an online special address at the World Economic Forum on Monday that a strong democracy like India was bringing to the world a “beautiful gift’’.The gift, he said, was “a bouquet of hope” even as India was battling yet another wave of the Covid pandemic with the right circumspection and caution."There was a time," Modi said, "when India was recognised for its licence raj. But the present government understands the difficulties faced by businesses and has been constantly trying to remove all such challenges"."Today the ease of doing business has been increasing, government interference has gone down and corporate tax rates reduced to make it more competitive in the world. These deepening economic reforms are another big reason why India is the most attractive destination," he said.“Just like expatriate Indians are displaying their skills on the global stage, youth in India is ready to take your businesses to new heights,’’ said the PM while listing insurance, defence, banking, space as sectors that have been deregulated and where overseas companies ought to invest.The Prime Minister gave a detailed overview of the reforms so far such as reducing 25,000 compliance-related norms, scrapping retrospective taxation, and in general restoring the confidence of the industry. The geospatial mapping space has been deregulated and outdated regulations scrapped in the IT and BPO space. India is committed to becoming a trusted partner in the global supply chain, he added.The PM’s last year’s address at WEF was badly timed when he had said that “India is among the most successful countries in saving lives’’ and that India “is a country that saved mankind from a big disaster by saving its citizens from the pandemic’’. The devastating second wave hit shortly thereafter.This time, he said, “in moments of distress, we saw how India’s ‘One Earth One World’ vision helped many countries with much-needed medicines and vaccines, thereby saving crores of lives”. “Today India is the world’s third-biggest pharma producer and among those countries whose health professionals and doctors by their empathy and expertise are winning the trust of everyone,” he said. Addressing the World Economic Forum's #DavosAgenda. @wef https://t.co/SIjcQ741NB                                     #Covid                                     #Davos                                     #growth                                     #Modi                                     #WEF                                     #worldeconomicforum||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/world-economic-forum-india-working-on-signing-free-trade-deals-with-many-countries-says-pm-modi-362088

The same drug in two divided doses of one to 2 mg/kg can be given for same duration in severe cases.“Inhalational budesonide (given via metered dose inhaler/dry powder inhaler) at a dose of 800 mcg BD for five days can be given in mild cases if symptoms (fever and/or cough) are persistent beyond five days of disease onset,” it was stated in the guidelines.If cough persists for more than two-three weeks, one should opt for investigation for tuberculosis and other conditions, they stated.The revised guidelines continue to recommend emergency use authorisation (EUA) or off-label use of remdesivir in patients with “moderate to severe” disease and those with no renal or hepatic dysfunction within 10 days of the onset of any symptom.It warned against use of the drug for patients who are not on oxygen support or in home settings.According to the guidelines, EUA or off-label use of the tocilizumab drug may be considered for use in the presence of severe disease, preferably within 24 to 48 hours of onset of severe disease or intensive care unit (ICU) admission.Tocilizumab may be considered for patients with significantly raised inflammatory markers, and not improving despite use of steroids with there being no active bacterial, fungal or tubercular infection, they stated. Coronavirus patients have been classified into those affected by mild, moderate and severe disease, the guidelines stated.According to the guidance note, upper respiratory tract symptoms without shortness of breath or hypoxia has been categorised as mild disease and have been advised home isolation and care.” Those suffering from mild Covid should seek medical attention if they have difficulty in breathing, high grade fever, or severe cough lasting for more than five days.Those having breathlessness with SpO2 fluctuating between 90-93 per cent, can get admitted to a ward, and they will be considered moderate cases. Such patients should be given oxygen support and awake proning should be encouraged in all patients requiring supplemental oxygen therapy, in sequential position changes every two hours, the guidelines stated.Respiratory rate over 30 per minute, breathlessness or SpO2 lower than 90 per cent on room air should be considered as severe disease and such patients have to admitted to an ICU as they will need respiratory support, they stated.Such patients should be put on respiratory support. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) -- helmet or face mask interface depending on availability—may be considered in those with increasing oxygen requirements if work of breathing is low.High flow nasal cannula should be considered in patients with increasing oxygen requirements. Intubation should be prioritised in patients with high work of breathing if NIV is not tolerated and institutional protocol for ventilatory management should be used when required, the new guidelines stated.Those aged above 60 years, or those having cardiovascular disease, hypertension and coronary artery disease diabetes mellitus and other immunocompromised states, such as HIV, active tuberculosis, chronic lung, kidney or liver disease, cerebrovascular disease or obesity are at high risk for severe disease and mortality, the guidelines stated.                                      #AIIMS,                                     #Covid                                     #ICMR                                     #injectablesteroids                                     #mucormycosis||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-treatment-govt-issues-revised-guidelines-on-use-of-drugs-therapies-362089

18-01-2022||Dubai||Two Indians among 3 killed in suspected drone attack in Abu Dhabi||Three fuel trucks exploded, killing three people—two Indians and a Pakistan—and a fire broke out near Abu Dhabi airport on Monday in what Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group said was an attack deep inside the United Arab Emirates, the region's commercial and tourism hub.If confirmed, a Houthi drone strike on the UAE capital would take the war between the group and a Saudi-led coalition to a new level and may hinder efforts to contain regional tensions as Washington and Tehran work to rescue a nuclear deal.The UAE, a member of the coalition, has armed and trained local Yemeni forces that recently joined fighting against the Houthis in Yemen's energy-producing Shabwa and Marib regions."With (nuclear) negotiators running out of time, the risk of a deterioration in the region’s security climate is rising," said Torbjorn Soltvedt, Principal MENA Analyst at a risk intelligence company, Verisk Maplecroft.The Houthi movement has frequently launched cross-border missile and drone attacks on Saudi Arabia, but has claimed few such attacks on the UAE, mostly denied by Emirati authorities.Three people were killed and six wounded when three fuel tanker trucks exploded in the industrial Musaffah area near storage facilities of oil firm ADNOC, state news agency WAM said.Unverified footage on social media earlier showed a thick plume of black smoke billowing from what appeared to be Musaffah. Police closed the road leading to the area."Initial investigations found parts of a small plane that could possibly be a drone at both sites that could have caused the explosion and the fire," Abu Dhabi police said, adding there was no significant damage.An Etihad Airways spokesperson said a small number of flights were briefly disrupted at Abu Dhabi airport due to "precautionary measures", but normal operations quickly resumed.The Houthi's military spokesman said the group launched a military operation "deep in the UAE". Its chief negotiator, Mohammed Abdulsalam, which Houthi-run media said was currently visiting Tehran, warned the UAE against "tampering in Yemen".If confirmed, a Houthi strike could potentially derail UAE and wider Gulf dialogue with Iran, said UAE political analyst Abdulkhaleq Abdulla."The UAE is not going to take this very lightly," he said, adding it was still too early to assess Abu Dhabi's response.Proxy fightThe Yemen war is seen as a proxy fight between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran. But both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi had moved to engage https://www.reuters.com/world/stuck-middle-uae-walks-tightrope-between-us-israel-iran-2021-12-12 directly with Iran in recent months to avoid any wider conflict that could hurt regional economic ambitions.The Abu Dhabi stock market index ended 0.1% lower after the news. The index had gained as much as 0.3% in early trade.The incidents coincided with a visit to the UAE by South Korean President Moon Jae-in. A Blue House official said a summit between Moon and Abu Dhabi's crown prince was cancelled due to an "unforeseen and urgent matter of state".Given the range of Houthi attacks against Saudi Arabia it was not "technically surprising" the group would be able to hit UAE targets, said Jean-Loup Samaan, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute.UAE authorities and ADNOC did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. The coalition's spokesman did not respond.Saudi Arabia and Bahrain condemned what they described as a "cowardly, terrorist" attack. There was no immediate comment from Iranian officials, but Iran's Tasnim news agency reported it as an "important operation".In July 2018, the UAE denied reports that the Houthis had attacked Abu Dhabi airport with a drone. A month later, Dubai International Airport said it was operating as normal after Houthi-run media said the group launched a drone attack there.“The smaller they (drones) are the harder would be to detect and intercept. No state is fully protected against this kind of threat," said Riad Kahwaji, chief executive of UAE-based INEGMA Middle East think tank.                                      #abudhabi                                     #airport                                     #drone                                     #fire                                     #Indians                                     #Pakistani||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/uae-says-suspects-drones-behind-abu-dhabi-fires-yemens-houthis-claim-attack-362043
18-01-2022||Satya PrakashNew Delhi||Covid-19: No one can be vaccinated against his will, Centre tells SC||The Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that no person can be administered Covid-19 vaccine against his/her will even as it said people to get vaccinated in the larger public interest.In an affidavit filed in the top court, the Union health ministry said the government has not issued any SOP which made it mandatory for anybody to carry a vaccination certificate for any purpose.The affidavit has been filed in response to NGO Evara Foundation’s petition seeking door-to-door priority Covid-19 vaccination for persons with disabilities.With regard to exempting persons with disabilities from producing vaccination certificates, the affidavit stated that it has not issued any SOP that made it mandatory to carry the vaccination certificate for any purpose.The affidavit said: “It is duly advised, advertised and communicated through various print and social media platforms that all citizens should get vaccinated and systems and processes have been designed to facilitate the same”. However, no person can be forced to be vaccinated against their wishes.”The union health ministry submitted that “the direction and guidelines released by Government of India and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare do not envisage any forcible vaccination without obtaining consent of the concerned individual.”However, it sought to emphasize that “vaccination for Covid-19 is of larger public interest in view of the ongoing pandemic situation.”Meanwhile, Dr Jacob Puliyel—a former member of the National Technical Advisory Group of Immunization – has moved the top court challenging the vaccine mandates issued by the governments of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.Dr Puliyel—who also urged the court to issue directions to publicize the data of clinical trials and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines administered to children—pointed out that the Centre has said that vaccination was voluntary and can’t be mandated at this stage.Contending that children were incapable of legal consent to the vaccines, he said the parents who gave consent on their behalf were incapable of giving “informed consent” in the absence of studies and data on the benefits and adverse effects of vaccines on children.He wondered how the states could make vaccination mandatory for opening shops, retaining employment, entering educational institutions and even stepping out on public streets.                                     #corona                                     #coronavirus                                     #Covid                                     #Covid-                                     #HealthMinistry                                     #mandatoryvaccination                                     #SC                                     #SupremeCourt                                     #vaccine||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-no-person-can-be-vaccinated-against-his-will-centre-tells-sc-362012
