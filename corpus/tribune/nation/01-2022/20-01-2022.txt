I have always respected Manohar Parrikar ji. Utpal ji is welcome to join and fight elections on AAP ticket," the Delhi Chief Minister said in a tweet minutes after the saffron party announced the list of candidates.Utpal Parrikar, who had been demanding the BJP's ticket from the Panaji seat, did not get the party's candidature as per its list of 34 candidates which it announced on Thursday. Manohar Parrikar, who died in March 2019 while serving as the chief minister of the coastal state, had represented this constituency for more than two decades.While announcing the list of candidates for the February 14 Goa polls, BJP's state election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis said in Delhi that the party had given four other options to Utpal Parrikar, which he did not accept.Utpal Parrikar was not available for his comment.                                      #AAP                                     #ArvindKejriwal                                     #BJP                                     #GoaPolls2022                                     #UtpalParrikar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kejriwal-slams-bjp-for-use-and-throw-policy-towards-parrikar-family-invites-utpal-to-join-aap-for-goa-poll-362993

20-01-2022||New Delhi||63 pc healthcare, 58 pc frontline workers, 39 pc above 60 received Covid precaution jab: Govt||About 63 per cent eligible healthcare workers, 58 per cent frontline workers and 39 per cent of people above 60 years of age with comorbidities have received their precaution dose of Covid-19 vaccine, the health ministry said on Thursday.Responding to a question, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said about 22.66 lakh out of 35 lakh healthcare workers have received their precaution dose, accounting for 63 per cent of such people.He said there are 33 lakh frontline workers who were due for precaution dose and 1,91,400 have got precaution dose which is 58 per cent.“Those above 60 years and with comorbidities, the eligible number is 47,81,000 out of them 18,66,000 have taken precaution dose which comes to 39 per cent,” Bhushan said.“So given the fact it has been only 10 days since we rolled out precaution dose the coverage yet is not bad though we are constantly engaging with the states to ensure that the uptake increases. It is essential that all of must motivate people to get doses for which they are eligible,” he said.NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr V K Paul said there are still about 1 crore people (in the over 60 age group) who are yet to get their first dose.“And 25 per cent are yet to get a second dose. This is unfinished work. 52 per cent children have been covered in the 15-17 years age group, more healthcare and frontline workers should also come forward. Availability is not at all an issue here,” he said.Paul said there are still 6.5 crore people whose second dose is overdue.“Why should it be overdue, everyone should take their second dose. All those who are not fully protected will not be a danger to itself but others too. We have to accept masks and protect our seniors and the prevention tool here is vaccination and we need to take it in this paradigm,” he said.                                      #comorbidities                                     #Covid19vaccine                                     #frontline                                     #healthcareworker||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/63-pc-healthcare-58-pc-frontline-workers-39-pc-above-60-received-covid-precaution-jab-govt-362974

"We have decided to reopen schools from Grade 1 to Grade 12 from Monday." The spike in infections had prompted the closures early in January, after most grades resumed temporarily last month.In New Delhi, where Omicron infections have also fallen sharply since the surge this month, city authorities said they were considering lifting curbs.Delhi has shut schools, private offices, restaurants and has imposed weekend curfew.

Utpal on Thursday confirmed that the BJP had offered him the Bicholim seat as a compromise, but added that he was not going to take up on the offer. Utpal has already warned the BJP, that he would contest as an independent candidate, if he is denied a ticket from Panaji.Defending the BJP's decision to grant Monserrate the ticket, Fadnavis said: "A sitting MLA has been given a ticket in Panaji. Parrikar's family is our family. They are close to us"."I had given Utpal Parrikar two options about where he could contest. He had refused one option. We are still discussing the second option with him. We all feel he should accept it. BJP has respected the Parrikar family," Fadnavis also told the press conference in Delhi.The BJP has also fielded sitting Vasco MLA and former Urban Development Minister Milind Naik, who last month was at the centre of a sex scandal, after the Congress released videos, audio and WhatsApp messages featuring the now former Minister alleging that Naik was sexually exploiting a widow from Bihar.While the police have claimed that they have found no substance in the complaint filed by Congress vice president Sankalp Amonkar against Naik, the former Minister has denied all allegations.Former Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar has been denied a ticket to contest from the Mandrem Assembly constituency, which has been allotted to sitting MLA Dayanand Sopte. Sopte was elected to the state Assembly in 2017 on a Congress ticket, but joined the BJP subsequently.According to BJP national general secretary Arun Singh, in the ticket allocation exercise, the BJP has reached out to all sections of society, including minorities, OBC, ST and SC candidates."The world's biggest party, BJP, has worked for the rights of the dalits and backward classes. In three general seats, ST candidates have been fielded, in one general seat BJP has fielded SC candidate, there are 11 OBC candidates and nine minority candidates who are Christians," Singh said.

20-01-2022||New Delhi||Seems peak of Covid 3rd wave in Delhi has gone past: Jain||Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said it seems that the peak of the third Covid wave has gone past in the national capital, even as he cautioned that the city is not out of the danger zone yet.Interacting with reporters, Jain said Delhi saw a record surge in the number of daily Covid cases recently with over 28,000 cases registered in a day and the positivity rate too had gone beyond 30 per cent."That spike which Delhi saw can be considered as the peak of the Covid wave and it seems that we are past the peak now.... The number of daily cases has come down in the last few days. Over 13,000 cases were recorded yesterday with a positivity rate of close to 24 per cent. And today, the number of cases is lesser than that," he said.The national capital reported 28,867 fresh Covid cases on January 13, the sharpest single-day spike here since the outbreak of the pandemic, with a positivity rate of 29.21 per cent. On January 14, the positivity rate had increased to over 30 per cent.Jain, however, cautioned that the peak of the Covid wave may have gone past in Delhi, but "still we cannot say that we are out of the danger zone yet and we need to watch the trend".Asked if some restrictions will be eased, the minister said proactive measures have also led to the fall in the number of cases and for any decision on easing restrictions, "we will have to monitor the situation first in the coming days".On a reduction in the number of tests to detect the infection, Jain claimed that Delhi is still conducting more daily tests than other states and "no one is being denied any test, if needed".                                      #covid3rdwave                                     #Delhi                                     #satyendarjain||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/seems-peak-of-covid-3rd-wave-in-delhi-has-gone-past-jain-362941
20-01-2022||Vibha Sharma||Chandrashekhar Azad 'Ravan' to contest against Yogi Adityanath from Gorakhpur||New Delhi, January 20Political high drama continued in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh with Dalit leader Chandrashekhar Azad ‘Ravan’ on Thursday declaring himself a candidate against Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in Gorakhpur.This will be Adityanath’s first election for the Assembly, and also of 34-year-old Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar.The BJP’s main rival, the Samajwadi Party, is yet to announce its candidate.Though in 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he backtracked after saying that he would contest against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In 2020, he founded the Azad Samaj Party, whichannounced that Azad would contest the polls to further BR Ambedkar's motto of 'Bahujan Hitay, Bahujan Sukhay'.Last year, he had said, “It is not important for me to win a place in the UP assembly. It is important for me that Yogi Adityanath should not get to be the assembly. So, I will contest from wherever he contests.”Azad and his party have no base in Gorakhpur or eastern Uttar Pradesh. The seat is with the BJP, with the sitting MLA being Radha Mohan Das Agarwal.The Bhim Army drew attention during the May 2017 clashes between Dalits and upper-caste Thakurs in Saharanpur following which Azad was arrested. Arrested under the NSA, he was released in September 2018 after 16 months in jail.Azad recently said his party, the Azad Samaj Party, wanted to join the SP-led alliance to defeat the BJP.“After all the discussions, in the end, I felt that Akhilesh Yadav does not want Dalits in this alliance, he just wants Dalit vote bank. He humiliated the people of Bahujan Samaj, I tried hard but the alliance could not happen,” he had said recently.Akhilesh Yadav has stitched an alliance with several small caste-based parties, building his campaign on social justice for backward classes and Dalits.Azad said leaders of backward classes, Dalits and others are supporting Yadav in the belief that he would do social justice.Gorakhpur is the political turf of Adityanath. He had been the MP from Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat since 1998 until he became the chief minister in 2017.Azad said his party is open to having an alliance with others and that his fight is against the RSS and the BJP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chandrashekhar-azad-ravan-to-contest-against-yogi-adityanath-from-gorakhpur-362939
20-01-2022||United Nations||UAE terror attack blatant violation of international law, UNSC should stand united in sending clear signal against such acts: India||Strongly condemning the drone strikes in Abu Dhabi in which two Indians were killed, India has termed the attacks on innocent civilians and infrastructure as a "blatant violation of international law", stressing that the Security Council should stand united in sending a clear signal against such heinous acts of terror.At a Security Council open debate on the Middle East on Wednesday, India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti expressed strong condemnation of the recent terror attack in Abu Dhabi, in which three people, including two Indians tragically lost their lives.“Such an attack on innocent civilians and civilian infrastructure is completely unacceptable. It is a blatant violation of international law. It is also against all civilised norms,” he said.Emphasising that India stands in solidarity with the UAE, Tirumurti said New Delhi extends its full support for an unequivocal condemnation by the Council of this terrorist attack.“It is important that the Council stands united in sending a clear signal against such heinous acts of terror,” he said.On the morning of January 17, the Houthis targeted the Musaffah ICAD 3 area and the new construction area at Abu Dhabi International Airport, both of which are civilian infrastructure.The attacks, which led to the explosion of three petroleum tankers, killed two Indian civilians and one Pakistani civilian and injured six other civilians, including two Indians.“The Houthis confirmed responsibility for the attacks,” a statement from the UAE mission here said.The United Arab Emirates had requested a meeting of the UN Security Council to address the Houthi terrorist attacks in Abu Dhabi.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar Tuesday had a telephonic conversation with the Foreign Minister of UAE Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan during which the two discussed the terror attack.Jaishankar condemned the terror attack in the strongest terms and emphasised that “in this day and age, such an attack on innocent civilians was completely unacceptable and against all civilised norms.” Tirumurti also voiced deep concern by recent developments in the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza.“Violent attacks on civilians have increased in recent weeks. Acts of destruction and provocation are continuing. New settlement units have been announced. We call upon the parties to immediately make concrete efforts to reverse these actions,” he said.India underlined that such unilateral measures unduly alter the status quo on the ground, undercut the viability of the two-state solution and pose serious challenges to the resumption of peace talks. “They must be eschewed." Tirumurti highlighted the urgent necessity for reversing the negative trends on the ground and the need for a roadmap for the resumption of direct political negotiations.He said the international community must also send a strong signal against any step that will prevent the possibility of durable peace between Israel and Palestine in the near future.“It is extremely important to prevent actions that undermine Confidence Building Measures, the parties must focus on constructive measures.India noted that it is “encouraged” by direct contacts between the Israeli and Palestinian leadership.Tirumurti termed as “welcome developments” the recent meeting between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz and the subsequent Israeli announcement to continue the advancement of socio-economic measures along with those determined in the previous meetings, such as the advancing of the transfer of tax payments and status approvals.“Such initiatives which are in the interest of both parties help maintain stability and discourage possible recurrence of terror and violence,” he said.“Full and immediate implementation of these measures and continued high-level interactions must be accompanied by a clear roadmap for early resumption of direct negotiations and all final status issues, which we believe is the best path towards achieving the goal of a two-state solution,” he said.Tirumurti reiterated India's “firm and unwavering” commitment to the peaceful resolution of the Palestinian issue and said New Delhi has supported a negotiated two-state solution leading to the establishment of a sovereign, independent and viable state of Palestine, living within secure and recognized borders side by side at peace with Israel.He said India has consistently called for direct peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine, based on the internationally agreed framework, taking into account legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for statehood, and Israel's legitimate security concerns.“The absence of these direct talks on key political issues has asymmetrical costs for both Israelis and Palestinians and does not augur well for long term peace in the region,” he said.India called upon the UN and the international community, the Middle East Quartet in particular, to prioritise the revival of these negotiations. “As a friend of Israel and Palestine, India will continue to support all efforts towards achieving a comprehensive and lasting two-state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict.”                                      #abudhabi                                     #DroneAttack                                     #India                                     #TerroristAttack                                     #UN||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uae-terror-attack-blatant-violation-of-international-law-unsc-should-stand-united-in-sending-clear-signal-against-such-acts-india-362938

He was involved in the planning of the app with the main accused, he said."His role came to light during the interrogation of the accused who were arrested earlier, following which a team of the cyber police station was sent to Odisha and he was placed under arrest," the official said.Singh is being brought to Mumbai and will be produced in a court here, he said.With his arrest, the Mumbai police have so far arrested four persons in the case. Earlier, Shweta Singh (18) and Mayank Rawal (21) were arrested from Uttarakhand, while engineering student Vishal Kumar Jha (21) was held from Bengaluru.Neeraj Bishnoi, one of the alleged main conspirators in the Bulli Bai app case, had been arrested by Delhi police from Assam.The Mumbai police had registered a First Information Report (FIR) against unidentified persons following complaints that doctored photographs of hundreds of Muslim women were uploaded for ‘auction' on the app called `Bulli Bai', hosted on the open-source software platform GitHub.While there was no actual `auction' or `sale', the purpose of the app seemed to be to humiliate and intimidate the targeted women, many of whom are active social media users.                                      #BulliBaiApp                                     #CyberCrime                                     #Mumbai                                     #Odisha||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bulli-bai-app-case-mumbai-cops-arrest-mba-graduate-in-odisha-362934

According to the complainant, the inspector allegedly took advantage of her situation when she went to lodge a complaint against her tenant on January 13.The woman reportedly went to the police station after being attacked by her tenant and her family members. Though she suffered injuries, her complaint was not registered by the inspector. Later, she was called to the inspector's chamber and given two options, the complainant alleged."Inspector Vasanth Kumar asked me to either pay Rs 5 lakh to him or oblige to his requests of sexual favour whenever he wants. He said that if she agreed to his demands he would help her," she alleged.She has explained that the Inspector had abused her verbally after she refused to give in to his demands. The victim said that Inspector threatened to get at least 10 complaints lodged against her and also lodged an FIR against her. She maintained that bail was obtained with great difficulty in that case."After obtaining the bail, the accused inspector would call me to the station. He would take me to his chamber and force me to accept his offer. He used to hold my hand and drag and say that he wanted me at any cost. I suffered the torture for a long time," she said in the complaint.IANS                                     #bribe                                     #Karnatakapolice                                     #sex||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pay-bribe-or-have-sex-karnataka-cop-to-woman-362931
20-01-2022||Vibha Sharma||BJP fields Atanasio Monserrate 'Babush', from Panaji; Parikar's son not on list of 34 candidates announced for Goa poll||New Delhi, January 20The BJP on Thursday fielded Atanasio Monserrate ‘Babush’ from Panaji, the constituency of late Manohar Parrikar from where his son Utpal Parrikar was seeking the ticket.“Utpal Parrikar was given two other options,” one of which he refused, former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said announcing the list.“He should take the other option, this is my opinion,” he said, adding that Parrikar’s family is BJP’s family and the party had all respect for the late leader.A sitting MLA has been given the ticket.   Monserrate is a three-term member of the Goa Legislative Assembly. He was one of the 10 members of the Congress who joined the BJP in July 2019.The list also includes his wife Jennifer from Teleigao in the list of 34 candidates for the 40-member Goa Assembly election scheduled for February 14.Fadnavis defended her candidature saying she was a sitting MLA and had joined the BJP along with her husband, a reason why the BJP had also fielded her.The BJP has also fielded Divya Vishwajeet Rane, daughter-in-law of sitting Congress MLA Pratap Singh Rane, from Poreim.Announcing the list, Fadnavis slammed the MGP, GFP, TMC, AAP and Congress, the party’s rivals in the coming elections for “making false promises”.Praising former CM Parrikar for providing direction to the BJP in Goa, he pointed to the various infrastructure and health initiatives taken by the “double engine” party government.In 2017, Sidharth Sripad Kuncalienkerm had defeated Monserrate. Manohar Parrikar was the defence minister in the Centre at that time.Meanwhile, Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has been fielded from Sanquelim, the constituency he represents in the Assembly. Sawant took over the reins of the state after the demise of Manohar Parrikar.In the previous Assembly polls in 2017, the BJP, despite being the ruling party, had won only 13 seats, with the Congress emerging as the single largest party with 17 seats.The BJP, however, managed to cobble up a coalition with regional parties like the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), Goa Forward Party (GFP) and two independents, with Parrikar playing the key role.In 2019, the BJP ousted alliance partners from the government when 10 Congress MLAs defected to its camp.The MGP and the GFP have now forged new alliances for the upcoming polls, with the MGP tying up with new entrant Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC), while the GFP has allied with the Congress, which also seems to be looking to find the support of the NCP and the Shiv Sena.The BJP has fielded three ST candidates and one ST candidate on general seats. There are 11 OBC candidates, nine Christians, said general secretary Arun Singh, praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his “pro-OBC, Dalit policies”. Kejriwal offers Parrikar’s son to contest from AAPReacting to the development, AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal said, “Goans feel very sad that the BJP has adopted the use and throw policy even with the Parrikar family. I have always respected Manohar Parrikar ji. Utpal ji is welcome to join and fight elections on an AAP ticket.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-fields-atanasio-monserrate-babush-from-panaji-parikars-son-not-on-the-list-of-34-362920

The malaise is that we turned away from our duties and did not give them primacy," he said while launching year-long initiatives dedicated to Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav by the Brahma Kumaris, which include more than 30 campaigns and over 15,000 programmes and events.People only talked of their rights all these years and fought for them, he said, adding that speaking of rights may be right to some extent in certain circumstances.But forgetting one's duties completely has played a huge role in keeping India weak, Modi said and called for everyone to work together to discharge their duties that would remove social ills and also take India to new heights.He also asked organisations like Brahma Kumaris with international presence to work to present the right picture of India abroad and dispel rumours being spread about it."You all have been witness to various efforts being made to malign India's image. A lot of it goes on at the international level too. We cannot wash our hands off by saying this is all politics. This is not about politics but about our country," the prime minister said.In his speech, Modi said a society is being built that stands firmly on the foundation of equality and social justice."We are witnessing the emergence of an India whose thinking and approach are new, and decisions progressive," Modi said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/system-being-created-where-there-is-no-place-for-any-discrimination-pm-modi-362911

And what came after, a man entered the session was seen brushing his teeth and shaving facing the camera.While it appeared that the judge did not notice the incident, a video of the same was shared across social media.The man, in the video, appears to have just woken up and is seen walking back and forth in a room that appears to be a washroom. It appeared that he was either shaving his beard or brushing his teeth during the proceedings, and was seen doing so by other attendees.A similar incident was reported in November, when a shirtless man was spotted in Justice Devan Ramachandran's bench. The court had then remarked: “Who is this? What is going on? I don't have a problem with anyone listening to the proceedings, but at least adhere to the decorum. I can see a shirtless man here.

Late CDS Rawat was the pride of the country. He always worked for the welfare of Uttarakhand. I am happy to welcome Col Rawat into the BJP and particularly so because I am also the son of a soldier and have great affections for CDS Rawat whose demise left a vacuum in our lives. Col Vijay Rawat will take the ideals of his elder brother forward,” Dhami said, adding that the ruling BJP under PM Narendra Modi had always honoured soldiers and was the only party that would continue to honour the armed forces.Dhami mentioned the implementation of one rank one pension scheme under the BJP rule to make his point.The Uttarakhand elections will mainly witness a direct clash between the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress with Aam Aadmi Party also in the fray. The BJP holds 57 seats in the 70-member state Assembly and the Congress has 11. Uttarakhand, created in 2000, has witnessed massive political upheavals, four Assembly elections, 11 Chief Ministers and alternating governments.Col Rawat said his father, after retiring from the forces, worked with the BJP.“I am grateful for the opportunity to join the BJP. My father was with the BJP when Uttarakhand was formed. He had then retired and worked with the party. Now, I have been afforded the same opportunity after my retirement. The PM’s vision and his out-of-the-box thinking have inspired my decision,” Col Rawat said hailing the leadership of Dhami. Born in Dehradun on July 4, 1962, Col Rawat served in Sikkim, Rajasthan and Kashmir.Ex-CM Trivendra Rawat offers to opt outNew Delhi: Trivendra Rawat, former Uttarakhand CM, has written to BJP chief JP Nadda offering to opt out of the state polls and devote himself to organisational work.

20-01-2022||Aditi Tandon||Lakhimpur Kheri shadow: MoS Ajay Mishra, Varun, Maneka Gandhi not on star campaigners' list||New Delhi, January 19Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president JP Nadda and senior ministers Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah and Nitin Gadkari will lead the party’s campaign for the crucial phase-1 elections in Uttar Pradesh on February 10 with 58 segments of western UP set to go to polls.Missing from the list of 30 star campaigners are former Women and Child Development Minister and Sultanpur MP Maneka Gandhi, her son Varun (Pilibhit MP) and Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra, the MP from Kheri.Mishra has remained in the eye of storm ever since violence struck his Lok Sabha segment Lakhimpur on October 3, 2021, killing eight persons, including four farmers and a journalist. With the recent filing of charges of murder and pre-planned conspiracy against Mishra’s son Ashish, demands for his resignation have grown.The absence of Mishra from the BJP’s first list of star campaigners signals the party’s urge to escape the wrath of farmers, especially in western UP, where the movement against three farm laws was led by Jats and BKU’s national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait took the lead. Tikait hails from Sisauli in Muzaffarnagar, which goes to polls in phase-1.Western UP remains a challenge for the BJP, which had swept 51 of 71 seats here in 2017. BJP’s troubles have grown after Jat-dominated khaps tacitly resolved to back the SP-RLD alliance in the area, even though Rakesh Tikait publicly vowed to remain.Equally significant is the absence of Maneka and Varun with the latter taking repeated public positions favouring farmers in the aftermath of Lakhimpur violence. The mother-son duo hail from LS segments in Terai area where Sikhs are dominant. All farmers killed in the Kheri incident were Sikhs.Nadda, Irani, Rajnath on 30-member listPM Modi, BJP chief JP Nadda, Ministers Rajnath Singh, Amit Shah, Nitin Gadkari and Smriti Irani; UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Deputy CMs Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, Sanjeev Balyan, Hema Malini and Gen VK Singh are among those on list                                     #AjayMishra                                     #LakhimpurKheriKillings                                     #ManekaGandhi                                     #VarunGandhi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kheri-shadow-mos-mishra-varun-maneka-not-on-star-campaigners-list-362728

While the alliance was being considered a done deal, sources said the aim behind today’s press conference by BJP chief JP Nadda, Apna Dal’s Anupriya Patel and Nishad Party’s Sanjay Nishad was to send across a message to various backward classes in poll-bound UP.Several top leaders from the community, including a few ministers, had recently switched from the BJP to the Samajwadi Party (SP).Both Apna Dal and Nishad Party draw support from sections of backward castes. The Akhilesh Yadav-led SP too has stitched pacts with several caste-based parties.Flanked by Anupriya Patel, a Union Minister, and Sanjay Nishad, Nadda said the NDA would “contest and win” the elections under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘Sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas’. Nadda also lauded the Yogi Adityanath government for its “good performance” in terms of law and order, industrial investment and social welfare. “Development, social justice, pro-women and pro-backward class policies are the key achievements of the BJP’s double-engine government in UP,” he said.Patel and Nishad hailed the Modi regime for granting constitutional status to the OBC commission and giving the community reservation in education, including the NEET. They also hit out at the BJP’s rivals for allegedly denying a large section of backward classes their rights.“The Narendra Modi government brought about landmark changes and also developed places associated with father of Constitution Dr BR Ambedkar,” said Anupriya.Nishad also accused the past governments of discriminating against backward classes and Dalits. Quoting Fisheries Ministry as one of key achievements, he listed various Union Government schemes for his constituency.Akhilesh’s sister-in-law joins BJPSamajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav’s daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav joined the BJP on Wednesday, asserting that she has always been impressed with PM Modi. Aparna is married to Prateek Yadav, son of Mulayam’s second wife while SP chief Akhilesh is his son from the first marriage.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-announces-pact-with-apna-dal-nishad-party-mum-on-seat-sharing-362689

The Andhra Pradesh Chief Secretary assured the Bench that all cases where applicants had not received compensation would be reviewed and that he was ready to face contempt if that was not done.

Of the 158.54 crore doses of Covid-19 administered in India till date, the majority are Covishield. SII told experts that the administration of nearly 100 crore shots to Indians and others worldwide was a testimony to population-based efficacy and safety of the vaccine.In the past many months, accelerated vaccine development to prevent or reduce the severity of Covid has resulted in rapid global emergency regulatory approvals, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorisation (EUA) approvals and similar approvals worldwide, including in India.On August 23, 2021, the US FDA gave the first full regulatory approval for a Covid vaccine to Pfizer-BioNTech’s Comirnaty for individuals 16 years and older.With India keen on scaling up vaccinations and end hesitancy, the full approval to the two shots will aid expansion by allaying the fears of skeptics by way of full DCGI confidence in the safety of the two shots and their capacity to prevent severe Covid, hospitalisations and deaths.                                     #Covaxin                                     #Covishield||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covaxin-covishield-okayed-for-regular-market-approval-362692

It should not travel beyond that session. Anything other than this would be irrational. The real issue is about the rationality of the decision and the same should be for some purpose,” it had said.The Bench also pointed out that such long-term suspensions could be misused by a government having a razor-thin majority for its survival.Terming the suspension of 12 BJP MLAs for a year as “worse than expulsion”, the top court had on January 11 said it created a constitutional void as the constituencies concerned remained unrepresented in the House.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-reserves-verdict-on-plea-over-suspension-of-12-maha-bjp-mlas-362711
20-01-2022||New Delhi||Delhi Police write to Clubhouse app, Google over targeting of Muslim woman in group audio chat||The Delhi Police on Wednesday wrote to the Clubhouse app and search engine Google seeking details about the organiser of the alleged audio group chat in which “obscene comments were made against Muslim women”, official sources said.The police have also identified some members of the group audio chat, which included men and women from both communities, as part of the investigation, they said.Google has been asked to provide information about the Clubhouse application as well as the reason behind hosting it on their play store, they said.“We have identified five to six suspects as of now who were part of the alleged chat room. Many among them are also based outside Delhi and other states. Suspects include both men and women and all of them are adults,” one of the sources said.Police officials said that as per preliminary investigation, it has emerged that all the suspects were using fake names and operated from fake accounts, and efforts are underway to trace their exact locations and nab them.They said that suspects belong to both the communities and alleged that some among them had also modulated their voice and edited it in order to erase any digital footprint.The development comes a day after the Delhi Police’s Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations unit, which works under the supervision of Special Cell, filed an FIR against the unknown persons in the matter.The FIR was registered Tuesday just hours after the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) issued a notice to the Delhi Police demanding action against some people who made “obscene comments against Muslim women” on the app.“A case has already been registered in the matter under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. We have also written to Google and to Clubhouse app seeking details about the organiser of the alleged audio chap group in which some obscene comments were made against Muslim women,” the official source said on Wednesday.The sections include 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 354 A (sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment), according to police.In its notice to the Cyber Crime Cell, the DCW had said it had taken sou-moto cognisance of a video posted on Twitter which showed a Clubhouse conversation where Muslim women and girls were being referred to in a disparaging way.This comes days after hundreds of Muslim women were listed for “auction” on the Bulli Bai mobile application with photographs sourced without permission, and doctored. The app appeared to be a clone of Sulli Deals which triggered a similar row last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-police-write-to-clubhouse-app-google-over-targeting-of-muslim-woman-in-group-audio-chat-362685
20-01-2022||New Delhi||Covaxin, Covishield cleared for full market approval||Nearly a year after being granted emergency use authorisation for administration among the adult Indian population, subject experts of the Drug Controller General of India on Wednesday approved the two shots for full and regular market authorisation.“The Subject Expert Committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) on Covid-19 which reviewed Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech’s application seeking regular market authorization has recommended regular market approval to Covishield and Covaxin subject to certain conditions,” sources said.This was the second review of the applications submitted by Pune based SII and Hyderabad based Bharat Biotech.Of the 158.54 crore doses of Covid 19 administered in India till today, the majority are Covishield and the rest are Covaxin.SII told the experts that the administration of nearly 100 crore shots to Indians and others worldwide is a testimony to population based efficacy and safety of the Covid vaccine.An Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic. Under an EUA, FDA may allow the use of unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions when certain statutory criteria have been met, including that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives.In the past many months, accelerated vaccine development to prevent or reduce the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has resulted in rapid global emergency regulatory approvals, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorisation (EUA) approvals and similar approvals worldwide including in India.On August 23, 2021, the US FDA gave the first full regulatory approval for a COVID-19 vaccine to Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) for individuals 16 years and older.Full approval to Covishield and Covaxin marks a significant step forward to address concerns of people who were hesitant to get vaccinated due to only emergency use approvals to the shots.With India keen to scale up vaccination and end hesitancy, the full approvals to the two shots will aid expansion by allaying the fears of skeptics by way of full DCGI confidence in the safety of the two shots and their capacity to prevent severe Covid, hospitalizations and deaths.The CDSCO said in a statement, “The Subject Expert Committee of the CDSCO has recommended for upgrade of Covishield and Covaxin status from restricted use in emergency situations to grant of new drug permission with conditions in adult population. The Drug Controller General of India will evaluate the recommendations and give its decision.”                                     #Covaxin                                     #Covid19                                     #Covishield                                     #EmergencyUse||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-expert-panel-recommends-regular-market-approval-for-covishield-covaxin-362682

Late CDS Rawat was the pride of the country. He always worked for the welfare of Uttarakhand. I am happy to welcome Col Rawat into the BJP and am so because I am also the son of a soldier and have great affections for CDS Rawat whose demise left a deep vacuum in our lives. Today when Col Vijay Rawat is joining the BJP, he will take the ideals of his elder brother forward,” said Dhami, adding that the ruling BJP under prime minister Narendra Modi had always honoured soldiers and was the only party that would continue to honour Armed Forces personnel.Dhami mentioned the implementation of One Rank One Pension scheme under the BJP rule to make his point.The upcoming single-phase Uttarakhand elections on February 14 will mainly witness a direct clash between the ruling BJP and the opposition Congress with Aam Aadmi Party also in the fray.

My father was with BJP when Uttrakhand was formed. He had then retired and worked with the party. Now I have been afforded the same opportunity after my retirement. The vision of PM Modi, his out of the box thinking; policies and actions aimed at the advancement of India, have inspired my decision,” Col Vijay Rawat said.He hailed the leadership of Dhami, the third chief minister the BJP appointed in Uttrakhand in five years after Trivendra Rawat and Tirath Singh Rawat.Col Rawat cited BJP’s welfare and economic policies to say that the PM was working to enhance India’s image in the world and his policies were executed after deep discussion and thought.Born in Dehradun on July 4, 1962, Col Vijay Rawat served in Sikkim, Rajasthan and Kashmir.The joining took place today in the presence of Dhami, BJP general secretary in charge of Uttarakhand Dushyant Gautam and state unit president Madan Kaushik.                                      #BipinRawat                                     #BJP                                     #brother                                     #colonel                                     #Helicoptercrash                                     #join                                     #Uttarakhand                                     #Uttarakhandpolls                                     #VijayRawat||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/late-cds-gen-bipin-rawat-brother-joins-bjp-362657

Approach radar controller gave diverging heading and avoided mid-air collision," one of the officials noted.                                     #Bengaluruairport                                     #DGCA                                     #Indigo                                     #midaircollision                                     #planes||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indigo-planes-avert-mid-air-collision-over-bengaluru-airport-dgca-to-probe-take-strict-action-362655
20-01-2022||Vibha Sharma New Delhi||Uttar Pradesh polls: BJP finalises seat-sharing with Apna Dal and Nishad Party||The BJP-led NDA on Wednesday formally announced its alliance for the upcoming elections to the 403-member Uttar Pradesh Assembly with the Apna Dal and the Nishad Party, terming social justice and overall development as chief guiding principles for the coalition in the poll-bound state. BJP president JP Nadda also lauded Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath-led government for its performance on issues like law and order, boost in investment, and improvement in social indicators.Though the leaders said that the seat-sharing formula is ready, they did not divulge the exact numbers on which the three parties will contest.While an alliance with the Apna Dal and the Nishad Party was being considered a done deal, sources said the aim of today’s press conference by Nadda and leaders of the two constituents, Anupriya Patel and Sanjay Nishad, was to unitedly send message in mind chief competitor Samajwadi Party’s recent moves regarding the Other Backward Classes.Both Apna Dal and Nishad Party draw support from specific backward castes and OBCs, Yadavs and non-Yadavs, and Dalits play a key role in UP politics. The Akhilesh-Yadav led SP has stitched alliances with several caste-based parties and also included many OBC leaders, including from the BJP, into the party. Flanked by Apna Dal leader and union minister Anupriya Patel and Nishad Party’s Sanjay Nishad, Nadda said the NDA will “contest and win” the elections under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas’. “In the past five years UP has progressed in all sectors and done well on all social indicators,” Nadda said, terming ‘gareeb kalyan’ as a key focus of the Yogi Adityanath government. “Development, social justice, pro-women and pro-backward policies and law and order were the key achievements of the BJP’s double engine government,” the BJP president saidBoth Patel and Nishad hailed the Modi government for granting constitutional status to the OBC commission and giving the community reservation in education, including NEET. They also hit out at BJP’s rivals for “denying” a large section of backward communities their rights.Slamming “parties who claim to represent backward classes” for “paying mere lip service to their uplift” Anupriya claimed they “did not even consider reservation for OBCs in NEET”.“The (previous) UPA government ignored OBC reservation in medical seats. Those parties representing backward classes agreed to the reservation-less NEET policy.“The Narendra Modi-led-NDA government brought the changes, he also developed places associated with founding father Dr BR Ambedkar,” she said.Nishad also accused the past governments of discriminating against backward classes and Dalits. Quoting the Fisheries Ministry as one of the key achievements. Nishad enlisted schemes and benefits extended by the Modi government for his constituency.Sources, meanwhile, said that the seat-sharing formula for UP and Punjab is “ready” and details about how many constituencies each party will fight will be announced later. In UP, there appears to be “some issues on a couple of seats” which are being worked on, they said. Regarding Punjab, they said the BJP might settle for around 63-65 seats, leaving around 35-36 for Captain Amarinder Singh’s Punjab Lok Congress, 14-15 Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) and some for another possible new constituent.The central leadership has also discussed candidates for Uttarakhand and Goa with respective core groups.                                      #ApnaDal                                     #BJP                                     #NDA                                     #NishadParty                                     #seatsharing                                     #UPassemblypolls                                     #UPPolls                                     #UPpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nda-finalises-alliance-with-apna-dal-nishad-party-362650
