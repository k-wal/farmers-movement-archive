06-01-2022||---||India turns down Pak proposal for SAARC summit||New Delhi, January 6India has rejected Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi's proposal for a SAARC summit in Islamabad on grounds that ``there has been no material change in the situation’’ since the 18th gathering of eight South Asian leaders in Kathmandu in 2014.``Therefore there is still no consensus that would permit the holding of the summit,’’ said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi when asked to respond to Qureshi’s observations at a press conference.The 19th SAARC summit was scheduled to be held in Islamabad in November 2016. But India announced its boycott after a terrorist attack on an army camp in Uri, Jammu & Kashmir. Subsequently, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, the Maldives and Bhutan also declined to attend the summit leading to its indefinite postponement. Qureshi had suggested that the SAARC summit be held in Islamabad and India can attend it virtually if its leaders were averse to coming to Pakistan.Asked to confirm the possibility of holding the Republic Day parade with Presidents of five Central Asian nations in view of rising Omicron cases, Bagchi indicated that an announcement any which way will take closer to the date. The Vibrant Gujarat summit, which was to be attended by the Prime Ministers of Nepal and Russia, has already been postponed.On the Kremlin-floated proposal for possible Russia-India-China in-person summit, the spokesperson noted that the three Foreign Ministers had held a virtual meeting on November 26. ``Beyond that, there is nothing further to add,’’ he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-turns-down-pak-proposal-for-saarc-summit-358844

This incident also attracts violation of guidelines issued by the Union Home Ministry under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, whereby spitting in public is a punishable offence in the wake of the Covid pandemic,” the NCW said in a letter to the UP Police.“You are, therefore, required to immediately investigate the matter for appropriate action. The action taken/Status Report must be apprised to the commission at the earliest,” it said.Officials said the NCW will also send a notice to the hairstylist for a hearing.A noted hairstylist, Habib operates more than 850 salons and around 65 hair academies across 115 cities across India.In the video, Habib is seen spitting on the woman’s hair while she sits with her back to him and is heard saying “if there is scarcity of water, then use saliva”.The audience can be heard laughing and applauding in the background in the video which has now gone viral with Habib being criticised by netizens for his action.“When hair stylist Jawed Habib spat on a woman’s hair, the audience cheered Habib’s action. Not a single person objected to the shameful act by Habib. The woman has been identified as Pooja Gupta and she didn’t expect such a humiliating experience,” said Anshul Saxena on Twitter.Another video of the woman recounting the experience has also been posted on social media.“Yesterday, I attended a workshop of Jawed Habib. He invited me on the stage to give me a haircut. He said if there is no water, you can use saliva. From now onwards, I will go to my streetside barber for a haircut, but will not go to Habib,” said Gupta, who owns a beauty parlour.Later speaking to news channels, Gupta said she attended the workshop to learn from Habib and was delighted when she was called on stage by him.“He was not answering my questions. Then he pushed my head, I objected and said I have cervical issues. Then he spat twice on my hair and said that if you don’t have water in your parlour, then you can spit. My husband was making the video. After I came down from the stage, Habib’s assistant said he was just joking,” she said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncw-asks-up-police-to-probe-video-showing-hair-stylist-jawed-habib-spitting-on-womans-head-358843

06-01-2022||New Delhi||Congress accuses PM Modi, BJP of defaming, insulting Punjab, Punjabiat over security lapse issue||The Congress on Thursday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP of defaming and insulting Punjab and Punjabiat by playing petty politics on the issue of “security breach” during his visit to the poll-bound state.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said at a press conference that the Prime Minister and the ruling party are trying to create a controversy over the issue, which is dangerous for democracy.He cited several examples wherein the Prime Minister’s cavalcade was held up in Delhi, Noida and Lucknow, and said the Prime Minister did not use the same words to defame the chief ministers there as he did for Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi.“You want to defame the entire Punjab, its three crore people and Punjabiat and Punjabi culture. Punjabi tradition is such that they will protect you with their own lives and every Punjabi has that courage,” Khera told reporters.“To win petty political battles, you cannot undermine this country, any region of this country, any institution of this country. But, unfortunately, the Prime Minister always chooses to do this, especially when that region has nothing to do with the BJP, that region rejects the BJP always,” he said.“Why are you insulting Punjab,” he asked.In a “major security lapse”, Modi’s convoy was stranded on a flyover due to a blockade by farm protesters in Ferozepur on Wednesday. He returned from poll-bound Punjab without attending any event, including a rally.The Centre blamed the Congress government in Punjab for the breach.On Thursday, the state government constituted a two-member committee to conduct a “thorough probe” into the incident.The Congress leader said instead of politicising the matter, the Prime Minister should behave in a manner which befits the mighty institution he holds.“Do not try and prove it to the world, show it to the world something which is not true. India is not a banana republic, despite your efforts to make it one,” he said.Over the last 24 hours, Khera alleged, there have been some attempts unfortunately by the Prime Minister and the ruling party to create a controversy.The Congress leader claimed that as per the blue book that is followed by the Special Protection Group (SPG), there is advance security lesson in which all stakeholders and security agencies come together and follow it in letter and spirit.He said the SPG takes the final call and other agencies assist the SPG in executing it. “Let the enquiry report come out, facts will be there for you,” he said.The Congress leader claimed that what happened with the Prime Minister in Punjab was because of a sudden change of plans and him not taking an alternative route. He also did not provide time to the Punjab Police to clear the path, Khera claimed.He said the Prime Minister knowing well that the farmers are protesting against the Centre should have given more time to security forces or should have taken an alternative route.He also said the farmers are seeking sacking of MoS Ajay Mishra Teni whose son is named in the charge-sheet in Lakhimpur Kheri killings.Citing past examples, Khera said the Prime Minister had in 2017 elections in Gujarat accused former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, former Army General Deepak Kapoor and former Vice President Hamid Ansari of plotting against him in collusion with Pakistan.Khera said on September 22, 2017, the Prime Minister was visiting his home constituency Varanasi when some girls of Banaras Hindu University were protesting against harassment at the Lanka Gate area of Varanasi and top police officers tried to dissuade them, but they failed and the girls continued protesting.“Did you hear the Prime Minister utter these words, which he uttered yesterday for Punjab, in Punjab. ‘Thank You Mr Chief Minister, Main Zinda Laut Aya, I am returning alive’. You didn’t hear this against (UP CM) Adityanath. Why didn’t he use these words in UP,” he asked.He also said that on September 15, 2018 in Delhi, when the prime minister was attending the Swachhata Shramdan Programme, his cavalcade got stuck near Paharganj in a traffic jam. but he did not say, “Mr. Chief Minister, Mr. Arvind Kejriwal, Thank You, I am going back alive, why? Why these double standards.”                On December 25, 2017, when the prime minister was going to inaugurate the magenta line of the Metro in Gautam Buddha Nagar, his cavalcade lost its way, wasted some minutes, and a junior officer was suspended.

06-01-2022||New Delhi||SC reserves order on plea regarding EWS quota in NEET-PG admissions||The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its order on a plea related to the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota in connection with the NEET-PG admissions.A bench of justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna asked the parties to file their written submissions for consideration.“We have been hearing this matter for two days, we must start counselling in national interest,” the bench said.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the apex court that he would like to dispel the confusion that there is a change in the rules of the game midway.“Firstly, there is no change in the rules of the game. The regime which is the subject matter of this challenge is already implemented since 2019 except in the All India Quota,” he submitted.Senior advocates Arvind Datar and Shyam Divan appeared in the court on behalf of some of the candidates.Senior advocate P Wilson appeared for the Tamil Nadu government.The Centre had told the apex court on Wednesday that it would not accept a position whereby those falling in the OBC or the EWS category, whether before or after the exercise of revisiting the criterion of Rs 8 lakh annual income, are deprived of something that is legitimately due to them.The NEET-PG candidates, who have challenged a July 29, 2021, notification for the implementation of the OBC and the EWS quotas from the 2021-22 academic year, opposed the government’s justification of applying the Rs 8 lakh income criterion, saying no study has been conducted on it.Large-scale protests were held by resident doctors of various hospitals under the banner of the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) in Delhi and other parts of the country over the delay in the NEET-PG counselling, which has been postponed due to the pendency of the case and the Centre deciding to revisit the criterion for the determination of the EWS quota.

06-01-2022||---||Settle border dispute instead of engaging in ‘antics’ like renaming places: India to China||New Delhi, January 6India on Thursday pulled up China for “renaming’’ of places in Arunachal Pradesh and writing “inappropriate’’ letters to Indian MPs.  “We hope that instead of engaging in such antics, China will work constructively with us to resolve the outstanding friction points in areas along the Western Sector of the LAC in India-China border areas,’’ said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.Noting media reports of the Chinese side naming some places in Arunachal Pradesh last week, Bagchi said India had immediately conveyed its views on “such a ridiculous exercise to support untenable territorial claims’’.Calling Tuting as “DouDeng” or River Siyom as “XiYueMu” or even Kibithu as “Daba” does not alter the fact that Arunachal Pradesh has always been and will always remain an inalienable part of India, he added.Commenting on the reports about a bridge being made by the Chinese side on Pangong lake, Bagchi said the Government has been monitoring this activity closely. This bridge is being constructed in areas that have been under illegal occupation by China for around 60 years now. “As you are well aware India has never accepted such illegal occupation,’’ he pointed out.Separately, the Government has been taking all necessary steps to ensure that India’s security interests are fully protected. As part of these efforts, the Government has also, in the last seven years, increased significantly the budget for development of border infrastructure and completed more roads and bridges than ever before. These have provided much needed connectivity to the local population as well as logistical support to armed forces. “Government remains committed to this objective,’’ he said.Chinese diplomat’s letter to Indian MPs was ‘inappropriate’ in style, tenor, says MEAThe MEA also took umbrage to Political Counsellor at the Chinese Embassy writing letters to Indian MPs whose substance, tone and tenor of the letter are inappropriate. “The Chinese side should note that India is a vibrant democracy and MPs, as representatives of the people, undertake activities as per their views and beliefs. We expect the Chinese side to refrain from hyping normal activities by MPs and complicate further the situation in our bilateral relations,’’ observed Bagchi. Commenting on media reports about PLA unfurling a flag at Galwan Valley, he said this is not factually correct. Media houses in India have released pictures contradicting the claim, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-building-bridge-on-illegally-occupied-area-of-pangong-lake-govt-358817

We should learn from the past.”Former Prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were assassinated.The PM’s security breach has become a matter of intense political jockeying with the BJP accusing the Congress ruled Punjab government of harming the PM by ignoring security exigencies and the Congress calling the issue a BJP political drama to deflect attention from thin attendance at PM rally venue in Ferozepur yesterday.The PM had cancelled his rally after farmers blocked his cavalcade close to the venue while he was on way to Hussainiwala by road.While the home ministry has said accountability for the lapse will be fixed and has sought a report from Punjab government on what went wrong, Punjab CM Charanjit Channi had denied any security breach.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unfortunate-former-pm-devegowda-on-pm-security-breach-358768

Thankful to him for his concern. Grateful for his good wishes, which are always a source of strength. @rashtrapatibhvn pic.twitter.com/g6Unl8WCJJ  The Home Ministry, meanwhile, is awaiting the response of the Punjab government before fixing responsibility in the matter and has called for strictest action against those responsible.President Ram Nath Kovind met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Rashtrapati Bhavan today and received from him a first-hand account of the security breach in his convoy in Punjab yesterday. The President expressed his concerns about the serious lapse. pic.twitter.com/lzvAuriuGb  The developments came even as former prime minister HD Devegowda termed as unfortunate the controversy over PM’s security breach and cautioned against complacency in protecting the highest official of the state.The BJP, meanwhile, has met Punjab governor and demanded the sacking of DGP Sidharth Chattopadhyay and Home Minister Sukhjinder Randhawa.The matter is set to assume a major political colour on the eve of elections to Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Manipur and Punjab with the BJP set to project the Congress as a “Modi hater which tried to bring harm to the PM by exposing him for over 15 minutes at an elevated road in Punjab’s Ferozepur yesterday”, as already stated by Union minister Smriti Irani.The Congress has rejected the charges of security breach.Party chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “The BJP is enacting a political drama because of thin attendance at the PM’s rally. Is it our job to arrange crowds for the rally? See the BJP duplicity and doublespeak: When PM Modi’s convoy is stuck in traffic in Gautam Budh Nagar on 25th December, 2017; it’s ok and there is no security breach. When the PM’s convoy gets stuck in Delhi on 15th September, 2018 the BJP puts it out on its twitter and hails it! But as PM changed his route last minute and travels by road and a delay of 15 minutes happens in clearing the farmers it is projected as endangering his life. Did anyone attack PM’s convoy? Isn’t the BJP insulting three crore Punjabis by such false bogey? He is India’s PM not BJP’s.

The patient with several comorbidities, including severe diabetes, died last week and was confirmed Omicron positive after his demise. He was learnt to have received both vaccine doses.The ICMR today reiterated that Covid vaccines were “disease modifying and not disease preventing vaccines”.ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said, “You may still get infected after receiving the Covid vaccine, but you will also get a high degree of protection from severe disease and death.”The Health Ministry confirmed India’s first Omicron death on a day when daily new cases topped 58,097, the highest in 199 days and active caseload passed the 2 lakh mark at 2,14,004, the highest in 81 days.India added a whopping 1,38,163 active cases in nine days with the active caseload at 75,841 on December 27.

JP Nadda, BJP president, claimed that fearing a resounding defeat in the Assembly elections, the Congress government in Punjab had resorted to all possible tricks to “scuttle” Modi’s programme in the state. He accused CM Channi of “refusing to come on the phone to address the matter”.He also accused the Punjab Government of using the police to prevent people from attending the PM’s Ferozepur rally. “A large number of buses were stranded because of the high-handedness of the police and its connivance with the protesters. It’s sad that the PM’s visit to launch projects worth thousands of crores was disrupted. We will not let such cheap mentality impede Punjab’s development,” Nadda added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/deliberate-bid-to-physically-harm-pm-alleges-bjp-358501
06-01-2022||New Delhi||CDS Rawat chopper crash: No technical snag or sabotage; bad weather identified as prime reason||No technical snag or sabotage and bad weather leading to a phenomenon called Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) is believed to have been identified as the prime reason for the crash of the IAF helicopter near Coonoor that killed CDS Gen Bipin Rawat and 13 others, people familiar with the development said on Wednesday.Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari and Air Marshal Manvendra Singh who headed the tri-service investigation into the crash apprised Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on the findings of the probe on Wednesday.The people cited above said the investigators have ruled out any possibility of technical snag or sabotage in the crash of the Russian-origin twin-engine Mi-17V5 helicopter that was flying from Sulur airbase to Wellington on December 8.According to experts, the CFIT refers to a phenomenon when an aircraft under control is piloted into the ground, water or other terrains largely due to bad weather or pilot error.The CFIT generally takes place in bad weather conditions or when a flight is landing.There is no official comment on the probe report either by the Indian Air Force or by the defence ministry.According to the IATA (International Air Transport Association), CFIT refers to accidents in which there was a collision with terrain, water, or obstacle, without indication of loss of control of the aircraft.“The critical distinction in these types of accidents is the fact that the aircraft is under the control of the flight crew,” it said.                              The Federal Aviation Administration of the US government described CFIT as an unintentional collision with terrain (the ground, a mountain, a body of water, or an obstacle) while an aircraft is under positive control.“Most often, the pilot or crew is unaware of the looming disaster until it is too late,” it said.The people cited above said a sudden cloud cover could have resulted in the CFIT.“At times, a pilot may lose situational awareness when there is a visual disruption,” said an aviation expert.Visuals of the helicopter captured by locals before the crash had shown that the chopper was flying at a low altitude.The chopper had crashed around eight minutes before its scheduled landing at Wellington.The people said the probe team examined all likely scenarios for the crash including possible human error or whether it was a case of disorientation by the crew when the helicopter was preparing for landing.Gen Rawat’s wife Madhulika, his defence advisor Brigadier LS Lidder, staff officer to the Chief of Defence Staff, Lt Col Harjinder Singh and decorated pilot Group Captain Varun Singh were among 13 others killed in the crash near Coonoor in Tamil Nadu.Air Marshal Singh, who headed the probe team, is currently serving as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Bengaluru-headquartered Training Command of the IAF.He is known to be one of the best air crash investigators in the country.Before taking the reins of the Training Command, the Air Marshal was the Director General (Inspection and Safety) at the Air headquarters and developed various protocols for flight safety while serving in the post.Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar and a number of senior officials of the ministry were present when the IAF officials briefed the defence minister.

06-01-2022||Mumbai||Bulli Bai app probe: Sikh names were used to mislead, say Mumbai Police||The persons involved in the promotion of the ‘Bulli Bai' app targeting Muslim women used names related to the Sikh community in Twitter handles in an attempt to mislead, Mumbai Police said on Wednesday.This could have led to communal tension which the prompt arrests of three accused averted, the police said in a release.Earlier, Mumbai Police Commissioner Hemant Nagrale had told reporters that police were probing why such aliases were used. "Names related to the Sikh community were used to make it look like these Twitter handles had been created by persons from that community," the police release issued in the evening said.The women who were targeted were Muslim, so there was a possibility that it could have created "enmity between two communities" and led to "breach of public peace", it said."As the accused were arrested in time", this was avoided, the police said.The app, hosted on the GitHub platform, displayed photographs of women for "virtual auction", the release said, pointing out that this was similar to the Sullideals app case which had surfaced six months ago.   The accused shared photos from the Bulli Bai app on Twitter by using handles like @bullibai_, @sage0x11, @jatkhalsa7, @wannabesigmaf, @jatkhalsa and @Sikh_khalsa11.The information on the Twitter handle of the app claimed that its creator was "KSF Khalsa Sikh Force", while another Twitter handle, "Khalsa Supremacist", was its follower, the release said.During the technical analysis, police found the involvement of Vishal Kumar Jha (21), a second year civil engineering student of Dayanand Sagar College of engineering, Bengaluru, it said.The ‘Khalsa Supremacist' handle, allegedly used by Jha, mentioned the user's location as Canada, the release said.He also ran a YouTube channel called "Tavasya Vats".Police recovered a mobile phone, two SIM cards and a laptop from him.A senior police official told PTI that the Twitter handle of the app was created by ‘prime accused' Shweta Singh (18) who was arrested from Rudrapur in Uttarakhand.She had passed her Class 12 exam in the science stream and was preparing for joining an engineering course, he said.Mayank Rawal (21), the third accused, was also an engineering student, police said.
