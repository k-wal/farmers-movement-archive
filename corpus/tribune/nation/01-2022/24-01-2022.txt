It has earlier declared 53 candidates for the 70-member assembly election.Importantly Harak Singh Rawat, who was instrumental in toppling the Harish Rawat-led Congress government in 2016 by way of his defection with nine other MLAs, has not been fielded even in the second Congress list.Harish Rawat had demanded Harak Singh’s apology for the betrayal before accepting him back into the party last week.Meanwhile, Harish Rawat’s one time protege Ranjeet Rawat had staked a solid claim to Ramnagar seat but the Congress today decided otherwise.Harish Rawat has proposed that Ranjeet Rawat contest from Salt.Harish Rawat has been eyeing a safe seat after embarrassing twin losses to BJP candidates in 2017.Harish Rawat is also the Congress campaign chairman in Uttarakhand and has been upset over his non projection as the chief ministerial face though publicly he has said he respects the party’s decision to fight elections under collective leadership.                                     #Uttarakhandpolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-uttarakhand-cm-harish-rawat-to-contest-from-ramnagar-364073

They grew close to each other after which the youth asked her to meet him.According to the GRP, the girl informed them that she had left her house with money and jewellery as ‘Rahul’ had promised to marry her. She said she first travelled from Mumbai to Amritsar in Punjab, where she stayed for about 10 days, and then moved to Faridabad.Meanwhile, the girl’s parents had filed a missing complaint with the Mumbai Police.The GRP officials said Haider and the girl met at the Faridabad railway station.They said they grew suspicious when they heard the two conversing with each other.Upon questioning, the girl narrated the entire incident and that Haider had allegedly cheated her, the GRP said.They said the girl was handed over to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Faridabad, while the officials from the Mumbai Police, who were informed about Haider, arrived here and took him into custody.“We handed over the girl to her family in the presence of Mumbai Police while Haider was arrested”, Shripal Karhana, chairman of CWC, Faridabad, said. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/faridabad-youth-held-for-luring-mumbai-girl-through-fake-id-on-instagram-364070
24-01-2022||New Delhi||Air India’s proposed pre-flight checks of cabin crew’s grooming, BMI draw opposition||Air India has decided to check grooming and measure the body mass index (BMI) of cabin crew members at the airports just before their flights, according to an official order.The carrier’s two unions—Air India Employees’ Union (AIEU) and All India Cabin Crew Association (AICCA) -- on Monday wrote a letter to Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) Vikram Dev Dutt opposing the order on the grounds that it is dehumanising and in violation of rules prescribed by aviation regulator DGCA.“BMI is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in metres. A high BMI can indicate high body fatness,” stated the website of US’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The order dated January 20, 2022, has come days before Air India’s hand over to the Tata group, which acquired the carrier in a competitive bidding process last year.Cabin crew, who are well dressed and well groomed according to uniform standards and regulations, present a positive and professional image of the airline, the order stated.“It is therefore emphasized that, all cabin crew adhere to uniform regulations communicated by the circular dated November 18, 2019,” the order noted.The January 20 order was sent by Vasudha Chandana, Executive Director—In-flight Services, Air India, to all cabin crew members in the carrier.“Grooming associates have been assigned the task of recording observations on the BMI management/grooming/uniform turnout of cabin crew when they report for a flight or standby duty at CCMCO (Cabin Crew Movement Control Office),” she noted.These observations must be compiled and sent to her office, she stated.Each cabin crew shall be observed or assessed once on quarterly basis, she noted.However, it will be the responsibility of the cabin supervisor of the flight to ensure that her or his set of crew are well turned out and follow complete uniform regulations, she mentioned.All cabin supervisors must lead by example and ensure compliance by cabin crew at all times, she stated.Any non-compliance by a crew member must be noted in the report of the cabin supervisor, she noted.In a letter to the CMD, the aforementioned two unions said that as per DGCA’s rules, the BMI checks can be done only by medical practitioners.The unions said that such BMI checks at airports by non-medical “grooming associates” violates not only DGCA rules but also “settled service conditions and court orders”.“We must stipulate that we are not objecting to BMI checks, which crew have undergone for more than 15 years now, however, the same must be conducted by medical doctors, in the privacy of the Air India clinic, as has been the case until now,” the unions noted.This process of weighing scale checks at airports “dehumanises and denigrates” Air India’s cabin crew, apart from violating working conditions, they stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-indias-proposed-pre-flight-checks-of-cabin-crews-grooming-bmi-draw-opposition-364069

24-01-2022||New Delhi||No other offence apart from rape to prosecute husband for forced intercourse with wife: HC told||Forced intercourse with wife violates her right to bodily integrity as well as her sexual decisional autonomy and there is no other legal provision, apart from the offence of rape under Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, sufficient to prosecute the husband for that wrongdoing, the Delhi High Court was told on Monday.Senior advocate Rebecca John, who was appointed as amicus curiae to assist the court on the petitions challenging the constitutionality of the marital rape exception under Section 375 (rape) IPC, stated that the other offences that can be committed by the husband, including Sections 304 and 498A IPC and the violations under the domestic violence act, are distinct from the crime of rape and were introduced to deal with specific issues.“Section 498A includes an element of cruelty. It is not anyone’s case that rape is not a cruel act but cruelty in Section 498A is in connection with the dowry, which is different from rape in Section 375 IPC. Each of these offences is a standalone offence. Rape cannot be prosecuted under Section 498A,” said the senior lawyer who concluded her submissions in the case.The Bench of Justices Rajiv Shakdher and C Hari Shankar is hearing PILs filed by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association, a man and a woman seeking striking down of the exception granted to husbands under the Indian rape law.The court refused to entertain an intervention application and said that it cannot allow parties to interfere at a belated stage when the case has been pending for a long time.Lawyer J Sai Deepak, appearing for the intervenor, said that “there wasn’t a balance of representation with respect to the plurality of positions that are possible” on the issue.The Centre sought time from the court to formulate its stand after consultation with the stakeholders.While closing her submissions, John said that the striking down of the “immunity” granted to a husband concerning the offence of rape would not create a new offence and it disregarded a wife’s consent and the right to say no.“As against marital expectations, the wife has the right to sexual decisional autonomy and therefore, in expectation versus right, it is the right of the woman which must be upheld,” she submitted.“A wife’s right to bodily integrity will stand violated if the expectation of sexual intercourse is translated into a physical act of forced sexual intercourse without consent,” the amicus said as she emphasised that the international treaties and covenants, such as Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, should also be taken into account while deciding the present case.She also said there should be a sentencing board for the determination of the sentence to be awarded to an offender and discretion should be given to the trial court for reduction of sentence in appropriate cases.The amicus had earlier argued that there is no “right” but only an “expectation” of conjugal relations with wife in a marriage and the same also cannot lead to the husband having forced relations with her.She had also said that unlike several offences under the Indian Penal Code, the offence of rape was “gendered”, having “consent” of a woman as one of the ingredients and that the Justice JS Verma Committee report on amendments to criminal law had also recommended the deletion of the marital rape exception.The senior lawyer had further highlighted that such an exemption was not present in several other sexual offences in the IPC, including Section 354A IPC which concerns showing pornography to a female.Another amicus curiae and senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao had earlier told the court that apprehensions of misuse and protection of the institution of marriage cannot be a ground to sustain the marital rape exception in the Indian Penal Code (IPC).He had said that there was always a possibility of misuse of criminal offences and had the object of the legislation been to protect the institution of marriage, wives would not have been given the power to prosecute husbands for any offence including lessor sexual offences.The Delhi government has earlier told the court that marital rape was already covered as a “crime of cruelty” under the IPC.The Centre has earlier told the high court that it was considering a “constructive approach” to the issue and holding consultations with the stakeholders.The central government, in its earlier affidavit filed in the case, has said that marital rape cannot be made a criminal offence as it could become a phenomenon that may destabilise the institution of marriage and an easy tool for harassing the husbands.The petitioners have challenged the constitutionality of the marital rape exception under Section 375 IPC (rape) on the ground that it discriminated against married women who are sexually assaulted by their husbands.The court will hear the matter next on January 25. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-other-offence-apart-from-rape-to-prosecute-husband-for-forced-intercourse-with-wife-hc-told-364065

24-01-2022||---||Shaheen Bagh verdict: SC refuses plea for clarification, says ‘the judgment speaks for itself’||New Delhi, January 24The Supreme Court on Monday turned down a petition urging it to clarify its Shaheen Bagh verdict, saying no clarification was needed as the judgment spoke for itself.“The issue is over, why is it listed? What’s the clarification sought I don’t understand. There’s no clarification required. The whole issue is over. Sorry. No clarification of a judgment. The judgment speaks for itself. Dismissed,” a Bench led by Justice SK Kaul said rejecting the plea filed by Syed Bahadur Abbas Naqvi – an intervenor in the case.“We have dismissed this application, there’s no need for clarification, judgment has been passed, such an application is not maintainable, we are not going to entertain such applications in disposed of matters,” the Bench said.Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the Supreme Court had on October 20 ruled that roads and public spaces can’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.Deciding petitions seeking removal of protesters against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) from Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, a three-judge Bench headed by Justice SK Kaul had said, “We have…no hesitation in concluding that such kind of occupation of public ways, whether at the site in question or anywhere else for protests is not acceptable and the administration ought to take action to keep the areas clear of encroachments or obstructions.”On February 13 last year, the Supreme Court had dismissed a petition seeking review of its Shaheen Bagh verdict.“The right to protest cannot be anytime and everywhere. There may be some spontaneous protests but in case of prolonged dissent or protest, there cannot be continued occupation of public places affecting the rights of others,” it had said.“We have considered the earlier judicial pronouncements and recorded our opinion that the Constitutional scheme comes with a right to protest and express dissent but with an obligation to have certain duties,” it had said.                                     #ShaheenBagh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shaheen-bagh-verdict-sc-refuses-plea-for-clarification-says-the-judgment-speaks-for-itself-364059

In addition to taking ties to a higher level during previous Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s tenures, the Modi government has also initiated an ‘economic Quad’ in West Asia consisting of itself, Israel, the UAE and the US.The logo that was launched by the two envoys features the Star of David and the Ashoka Chakra and forms the numeral 30 depicting the 30th anniversary of bilateral relations.This special logo symbolises the strong friendship, love and admiration that exists between the people of Israel and the people of India. It also depicts the growing strategic partnership between the two sides.Both countries had launched a logo design contest last year for students of prominent design colleges in Israel and India.

This is just two days before PM Narendra Modi will hold the first-ever such interaction with the five Central Asian Presidents.With China giving hot competition in Central Asia, India is attempting to ensure that its first-ever summit with the five Presidents from the region on January 27 does not become a one-off affair.India has proposed that such a summit be held every two years and is also willing to bankroll a secretariat based here to push the various cooperation proposals forward.China made a surprise announcement on Monday that its President Xi Jinping will chair a virtual summit with Presidents of the five Central Asian Presidents to mark the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations.This is exactly what PM Modi plans to do on January 27 with the programme, unlike in the case of China, having been decided at least a month in advance.This will be China’s first major diplomatic action with Central Asia this year and the first heads-of-state meeting between China and the five Central Asia countries. “The summit is of great significance for all sides to take stock of the achievements and experience of China-Central Asia relations, and seek coordination and make plans for future bilateral cooperation,” said the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs while making the announcement on Monday.It is extremely unusual to announce such a summit just 24 hours before it is due to begin.To be fair, the India-Central Asia summit had been fixed much in advance. In fact, the five Central Asian Presidents were to arrive here in-person to participate as joint Chief Guests for the Republic Day celebrations. But the spike of Omicron cases forced the cancellation of their visit and it was agreed to hold the summit virtually on January 27.India and the five Central Asian countries have a foreign minister-level mechanism that has met thrice on an annual basis. New Delhi has proposed similar Ministerial level interactions on political issues and development cooperation; trade and connectivity; culture and tourism; and, defence and security.Beijing said during its summit, Xi and the five Central Asian Presidents will adopt and release a leaders’ joint statement. “China is ready to work with Central Asian countries to deepen political mutual trust and expand mutually beneficial cooperation across the board so as to further upgrade the relationship and bring it to new heights,” said its Foreign Affairs Ministry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-plan-rival-summits-with-central-asia-this-week-364055
24-01-2022||New Delhi||Delhi court frames sedition charge against Sharjeel Imam, denies him bail||A Delhi court on Monday framed charges under sedition against JNU student Sharjeel Imam and denied him bail in a case related to alleged inflammatory speeches made by him during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in 2019.“Accused is directed to be charged for the offences under sections 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting enmity on grounds of religion), 153B (assertions prejudicial to national integration), 505 (statements conducing to public mischief), of Indian Penal Code and section 13 (punishment for unlawful activities) of UAPA. Vide separate order, the application filed by Sharjeel Imam for grant of regular bail is dismissed,” Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat ordered.As per the prosecution, Imam had allegedly made speeches at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13, 2019, and at Aligarh Muslim University on December 16, 2019, where he threatened to cut off Assam and the rest of the Northeast from India.Imam, while seeking bail, said that his speeches do not fall within the meaning of Sedition. “Where is the call of violence? How does Sedition come into play? The context is to block the roads. How is this seditious? He called for a greater federal structure. That was the intent,” his lawyer had argued before the court.Whereas, the prosecution claimed that his speeches incited hatred, contempt, and disaffection towards the Central Government and instigated the people which led to the violence in December 2019.“In the garb of CAA, he (Imam) exhorted people of a particular community to block highways leading to major cities and resort to ‘chakka jaam’. Also, in the name of opposing CAA, he openly threatened to cut off Assam and other Northeastern states from the rest of the country,” the Delhi Police’s charge sheet stated.Imam is in judicial custody since January 2020. He is also one of the accused in the Delhi riots conspiracy case.In his defense, Imam had earlier told the court that he is not a terrorist and his prosecution is a “whip of a monarch rather than a government established by law”. Whereas, the prosecution claimed that violent riots took place pursuant to Imam’s speech.Delhi Police had filed a charge sheet against Imam in the case, in which it alleged that he allegedly gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt, and disaffection towards the Central Government and instigated the people which led to the violence in December 2019. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-court-frames-sedition-charge-against-sharjeel-imam-denies-him-bail-364052

AAP CM candidate Bhagwant Mann issued forth the slogan sitting in front of a poster with these words today.Addressing the press after holding canvassing for Jalandhar AAP canddiates here, Mann said this time the people of Punjab will be voting for twin faces of AAP supremo Kejriwal and him.Taking on CM Charanjit Singh Channi on the money found from his nephew's house, Mann said the CM couldn’t handle his relatives, how will he control Punjab?From 'Ik mauka Kejriwal nu' in the previous elections -- the Mann stated, this year ahead of the 2022 elections, AAP was asking people to give a chance to Kejriwal and him – “Ik Mauka Kejriwal te Bhagwant Mann Nu".Mann said like Channi and Sidhu, theirs was also a 'double engine'. However, he said the Congress pair but him and Kejriwal were in tune.Mann added, "This time it is "Jodiyan Da Muqabla" (contest of pairs). On one hand there is the jodi of Arvind Kejriwal and Bhagwant Mann, on the other Sidhu and Channi. Kejriwal and me are like elder and younger brother. But houses where brothers live peacefully are blessed but those where they fight are destroyed. Sidhu and Channi keep saying different things. They said theirs is a Double Engine. Sade Vala vi Double Engine hai (ours is also a double engine). Our engine is on one track. But Congress has 4-5 engines running on different tracks."Emphasising on his new role as the Chief Ministerial candidate, Mann said, "Main Party Da pradhan aan, mere chehre te election lari ja rahi hai. Match jeet gaye to taliyan bhi kaptaan ki, match haar gaye to galiyan bhi kaptaan ki. (I'm heading the party. The election is being contested on my face. If the match is won, the applause belongs to the captain. If it is lost, the abuse is also hurled at him. If any seat is lost or there is any discrepancy, then too it will be my responsibility)."Taking a dig at CM Charanjit Singh Channi on the recovery of money from his relative's house, Mann said Rs 10 crore was a huge amount of money to be found in a CM's relative house.Mann said, "CM had inadvertently admitted some days ago that he couldn't control his relative. I ask him, Sir if you can't control relatives, how will you control Punjab? No one gives 10 crore to my (Mann's) relatives or my nephew. The money must have been given for some wrongdoing. Channi sahab should tell what use was the 10 crore put to."Speaking on the issue of illegal mining Mann also said the former CM Capt Amarinder himself had expressed helplessness at taking action at so many Congress MLAs involved in illegal mining.Questioned on the delay in release of Delhi blast convict Devinder Singh Bhullar, Mann said, "A legal committee has been made on the issue. The moment it tables its report, the AAP government will clear the matter by doing the needful."                                     #AamAadmiParty                                     #Bhagwantmann                                     #PunjabAssemblypolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-too-are-a-double-engine-aap-cm-face-bhagwant-mann-seeks-mauka-for-him-and-kejriwal-364047

24-01-2022||Kohima/Guwahati||Nagaland, Assam ready for out-of-court settlement of border dispute: Neiphiu Rio||The governments of Nagaland and Assam are ready for an out-of-court settlement of the long-pending inter-state boundary dispute between the two northeastern neighbours, Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio said here on Monday.Rio said that Nagaland and Assam delegations are likely to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah in February to discuss and formulate how to go about the settlement.The Nagaland Assembly’s select committee to examine the border issue held an hour-and-a-half closed-door meeting, a day after Rio, his deputy Y Patton and NPF legislature party leader T R Zeilang met Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma at Guwahati on Sunday.“We had gone to Guwahati and had fruitful discussions on the border issue with Sarma. Nagaland and Assam had jointly taken up the matter with Union Home Minister Amit Shah on December 23, 2020.“Both the state governments are in favour of an out-of-court settlement, and maybe our teams will meet Shah in the first part of February to discuss and formulate how to go about it,” Rio told reporters here.The issue of royalty on petroleum and natural gas along the Assam-Nagaland border was also discussed.“If we resolve the border dispute and the issue of royalty, it will be good for both sides as we are going to remain neighbours,” Rio said.Asked about the delay in getting the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) report on the killing of 14 civilians by security forces in Mon district, the chief minister said that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) has completed the probe and is awaiting the forensic report.“Without the CFSL report, the findings will be incomplete, and there will be no evidence or scientific proof to proceed further,” Rio said.Asked whether Nagaland will get a forensic laboratory, the chief minister said that he will take up the matter with Shah.On Konyak Union and Eastern Nagaland Peoples’ Organisation giving a call to boycott Republic Day celebrations in protest against the killings, Rio said they are asking the government only to hoist the Tricolour in public offices.“They can say whatever they want in a democracy but the government will also do whatever it deems necessary,” he said.On demands for carving out more districts since the creation of Tseminyu, Nuiland and Chumukedima districts on December 18 last year, Rio said that the state government believes in tribal unity and has decided not to divide any existing tribal district.“There are demands for division of Mon, Mokokchung, Zunheboto, Wokha and Phek districts. But the fragmentation of tribal districts is not in the interest of Nagas. I appeal to various tribal organisations to understand this policy of the government for the welfare of Nagas as a whole,” he said.The inter-state boundary dispute erupted after Nagaland state was carved out of Assam in 1963. The two states share a 512.1-km-long border.The Nagaland State Act of 1962 had defined the state’s borders as per a 1925 notification when Naga Hills and Tuensang Area (NHTA) were integrated into a new administrative unit and made an autonomous area.Nagaland, however, did not accept the boundary delineation and demanded that the new state should comprise the Naga Hills and all Naga-dominated areas in the then North Cachar and Nagaon districts of Assam, which were part of Naga territory, created by the British according to an 1866 notification.Since Nagaland did not accept its notified borders, tensions between Assam and Nagaland soon flared up resulting in the first border clashes in 1965 and this was followed by major clashes between the two states along the border in 1968, 1979, 1985, 2007 and 2014.The Assam government had filed a case in the Supreme Court in 1988 for identification of the boundary and resolving the border dispute which is still pending.“The Nagaland issue is before the Supreme Court and we can expect a verdict in perhaps two-three years,” Sarma had earlier said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nagaland-assam-ready-for-out-of-court-settlement-of-border-dispute-neiphiu-rio-364039

When asked about farmers’ voting preferences, Tikait said, “When farmers are being forced to sell their produce at half of their cost price they need no one to prompt them as to how they should vote.” Farmers are “fully conscious” of the critical importance of their choice in the forthcoming assembly, he added.Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh will be held in seven phases between February 10 and March 7 and the results will be announced on March 10.                                      #RakeshTikat                                     #UPPolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-polls-tikait-cautions-farmers-against-attempts-to-polarise-society-364038
24-01-2022||Lucknow/New Delhi||BJP slams Akhilesh for Pakistan comments||The BJP on Monday slammed Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav for his reported comments that China is India’s real enemy while Pakistan is a “political enemy” which is targeted by the ruling party for “vote politics”.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said this shows Yadav’s mindset and he should tender an apology to the country for the comments which show his “love” for Pakistan.What the SP president has said is very unfortunate and disappointing, he said.Speaking to reporters in Lucknow, Patra said Yadav had also brought MA Jinnah, Pakistan’s founder, into the Uttar Pradesh Assembly poll campaign as well, and claimed that while the BJP under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is campaigning on development issues, the SP is depending on Jinnah and Pakistan.An interview in the Economic Times quoted Yadav to have said that India’s real enemy is China while Pakistan is a political enemy which the BJP attacks for its “vote politics”.He also hit out at the ruling party for China’s alleged encroachment on Indian land.Alleging that Yadav would have given poll ticket to Yakub Memon, who was executed for his role in the Mumbai bomb blasts, and made Ajmal Kasab, Pakistani terrorist executed for his role in the Mumbai terror attack, a star campaigner if he could, Patra accused the SP leader of making criminals his party candidates in the elections.Taking a swipe at him for the SP asking the Election Commission to ban opinion polls, most of which have shown the BJP ahead of the rival party, Patra said Yadav will find fault with EVMs after March 10, when votes will be counted.On Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s statement that Shiv Sena has “wasted” 25 years in alliance with the BJP, Patra said he has raised a question on his father’s decision.Speaking on Uttar Pradesh, he also said that it is a secure and aspirational state under the leadership of Modi and Adityanath.Making an appeal to the youth, the BJP leader said, “The coming elections in the state will be between the expressways of the BJP and the expressways of the SP.“The BJP’s are Purvanchal, Bundelkhand, Ganga and Gorakhpur link expressways. The SP’s are gundai expressway, rangdari expressway, dangai expressway and mafia expressway. You have to select between the two,” he said.Patra said the people of the state are intelligent and wise, and will choose development.Polls in Uttar Pradesh will be held in seven phases beginning February 10. —                                     #AkhileshYadav                                     #UPelections                                     #UPPolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-slams-akhilesh-for-pakistan-comments-364029

I am sure my child army will help me. Just like you led the Swachh Bharat campaign, please also take the lead in vocal for local movement. Make a list of household things and see how many of these are foreign made. Then insist upon your families to buy India-made products. This will boost local production, give a fillip to jobs, improve living standards of people and power the self-reliant India movement,” the PM told the awardees asking them to take inspiration from the past, fulfil goals of the present and dream new dreams for the future with an eye on 25 years later when India will celebrate 100years of independence.Congratulating the awardees (32 children for 2021 and 29 for 2022), the PM urged the children to read the life story of Guru Gobind Singh’s sons who displayed great valourto protect national pride.“The sahibzadas were very young when they sacrificed their lives in the service of the nation. To honour their memory we have dedicated December 26 as Veer Bal Divas,” the PM said.He also pointed to the magnificence of the occasion of National Children's Awards which are timed with national celebrations of ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ and said,“With these Awards comes great responsibility. You must not get overwhelmed by rising expectations. You must take inspiration from them."The PM hoped children’s dreams today will align with those of India and they will set new milestones in the path of national development.“You have a unique opportunity to sow what you reap,” the prime minister added, hailing the leadership Indian youth is providing to startups worldwide.He also spoke of how top global firms were today headed by India-born youth and saluted the potential of India's yougsters.Noting that the youth are at the centre of all government policies, the PM said Indian players were now attaining heights one considered impossible; girls were doing wonders in sectors where they were earlier barred and youth would soon power the Chandrayaan mission.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/children-must-lead-vocal-for-local-movement-pm-364015

Votes or support for any particular candidate should not be solicited," the EC letter to the CEOs read.However, if the video van is used for seeking votes or support for a candidate then the expenditure of the video van should be accounted for by such candidate appropriately."Expenditure observers to closely monitor this," the letter underlined.The vans can only be operated between 8 am and 8 pm and these vehicles cannot be used for rallies and roadshows.The parties are barred from displaying their campaigning material through these vehicles in market areas or crowded places.It will be the responsibility of the political party to ensure that the maximum stoppage for viewing of the vehicle at any location is not more than 30 minutes, it said.Assembly polls are scheduled to be held in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Goa and Uttarakhand.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ec-decision-on-video-vans-for-campaigning-in-poll-bound-assembly-polls-comes-with-riders-364010
24-01-2022||Mumbai||Schools reopen in Maharashtra amid flattening Covid curve||Schools resumed physical sessions for classes 1 to 12 in Maharashtra on Monday and the state government expressed hope that students would enjoy being back to their classrooms in a safe atmosphere.Last week, the Maharashtra government allowed the offline classes to resume from January 24 after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray approved a proposal to this effect that was sent to him by the school education department. Schools across the state were closed in the first week of January due to a spike in the coronavirus cases and in the wake of the emergence of the highly infectious Omicron variant. However, a number of parents, activists in the field as well as teachers had strongly opposed the move to shut the schools, saying it would adversely affect the students. In Mumbai, the local civic body had earlier announced the closure of schools for Classes 1 to 9 till January 31.But, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's (BMC) assessment later indicated that the cases of Omicron infection were not on the rise, and it had said the curve was flattening. It had prompted officials to propose the reopening of schools for physical attendance. On Monday morning, Maharashtra School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad greeted students and parents on the reopening of physical classes. "Wishing all parents and students the very best as physical classes reopen today onwards. We hope you enjoy your day back in a safe atmosphere. #BackToSchool. @scertmaha @CMOMaharashtra @msbshse," Gaikwad tweeted. In Mumbai also, various schools resumed offline classes in the morning. Last week, BMC Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had said that in-person or offline classes will resume in pre-primary schools too. While allowing the schools to resume physical classes, the state government has asked them to strictly adhere to COVID-19 protocols and guidelines.  On Sunday, Maharashtra reported 40,805 COVID-19 cases, taking its tally to 75,07,225, while 44 fatalities pushed the toll to 1,42,115, a health department official earlier said. No Omicron case was detected in the state on Sunday, keeping the tally of those affected by the new variant to 2,759, of whom 1,437 have been discharged so far, the official said.

Raghuram Rajan, former RBI GovernorKnown for his frank views, Rajan also said the government needed to do more to prevent a K-shaped recovery of the economy hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.Generally, a K-shaped recovery will reflect a situation where technology and large capital firms recover at a far faster rate than small businesses and industries that have been significantly impacted by the pandemic.“My greater worry about the economy is the scarring to the middle class, the small and medium sector, and our children’s minds, all of which will come into play after an initial rebound due to pent up demand.

A proposal to construct a permanent war memorial (Amar Jawan) at Delhi to commemorate all our war dead since Independence is under active consideration of the government. Whether the names of the war dead, including those of the December 1971 war with Pakistan, will be inscribed individually or whether their memory will be collectively commemorated by inscribing the names of Regiments and units, which took part in the various military operations and conflicts since Independence, is a matter on which the decision will be taken at an appropriate time,” Ram had told the Lok Sabha.The answer was given in reply to a question by Congress’ Junagadh MP Vekaria Nanjibhai Ravjibhai, who had asked, “Whether the government proposes to erect a victory memorial where names of the personnel of Armed Forces who died in the December 1971 war with Pakistan will be inscribed; if so the location thereof; if not reasons there for.”                                     #AmarJawanJyoti                                     #IndiraGandhi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-1972-indira-govt-too-proposed-permanent-war-memorial-363848
24-01-2022||Kolkata||Panel ignored nod for DNA testing of ashes: Netaji's kin||A new translation of a letter in Japanese written by the chief priest of Tokyo’s Renkoji temple, keeper of an urn containing ashes and bone fragments believed to be those of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, to the Indian government in 2005 revealed that permission was given for DNA test to the Justice MK Mukherjee Commission.Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal cmRejecting tableau Injustice to bengalYou (Centre) cannot proclaim love for Netaji by setting up a statue… injustice done to Bengal by rejecting Netaji tableau.However, for inexplicable reasons, this portion of the letter was not translated and a bland edited English version was attached to the Justice Mukherjee Commission’s report on the disappearance of Bose as evidence that “on account of the Temple Authorities reticence... the commission could not proceed further (on the issue of DNA tests)”.The commission later used this to conclude that the ashes were not of Netaji’s, giving credence to speculations that he may have survived to become an ascetic or prisoner in a Russian prison.Madhuri Bose, the legendary freedom fighter’s grandniece (grand-daughter of his brother Sarat Bose), said, “We recently commissioned the fresh translation after we found inconsistencies in the Mukherjee Commission report and found several paragraphs in the letter written in Japanese missing from the official English version in the Justice Mukherjee Inquiry Report.” —                                     #NetajiSubhasChandraBose||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/panel-ignored-nod-for-dna-testing-of-ashes-netajis-kin-363843

Of 17 MLAs, the party won in the 40-member Assembly, only two have stayed. The rest moved on to join the BJP which had won 13 MLAs in 2017.Thanks to defectors, the BJP’s current strength in the state is 27. Importantly, a recent report by the Association of Democratic Reforms described defection levels in Goa as unprecedented across India. “In the five-year tenure of the current Assembly (2017-2022), as many as 24 MLAs have changed their party, which is 60 per cent of the total strength of the House. It has never happened anywhere else in India. It is a clear reflection of utter disrespect to the mandate of voters. A callous approach to ethics and discipline overborne by uncontrolled greed at its worst,” the ADR report said, arguing for stringent penalties and laws to prevent defections.Earlier last year, Vijay Sardesai-led Goa Forward Party had taken its all three MLAs and office-bearers to the Dev Bodgeshwar temple at Mapusa to take a pledge of not supporting the BJP in the 2022 elections.Poaching by TMC reason for no alliance: PCCongress veteran P Chidambaram cited recent instances of poaching by the TMC as the reason behind no alliance with the party. “The TMC poached Luizinho Faleiro and even after the proposal of alliance they poached Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco whose name was in the Congress’ first list of the candidates,” Chidambaram said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assembly-polls-2022-rocked-by-defections-in-goa-congress-candidates-made-to-take-loyalty-pledge-363837

Also, a new modelling by IIT-Madras on the current Omicron surge has concluded that the third wave could peak in a fortnight. Government sources had earlier assessed that the daily new cases of the current surge would cross the peak of the second wave, which was 4.40 lakh new cases as seen on May 7, 2021.IIT researchers found that R-naught, the basic reproduction number of the virus, had fallen to 1.57 in indications of slightly slowing transmission. Already, metros like Delhi and Mumbai are reporting slow fall in new cases after hitting a peak.In worrisome news, the INSACOG noted that BA.2 lineage of Omicron variant was a substantial fraction in India and S Gene dropout-based screening was likely to give high false negatives.The UK Health Security Agency recently designated BA.2 a sub-lineage of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of concern and said it was under investigation and appeared to have a growth advantage.3,33,533 fresh casesTOTAL DEATHS 4,89,409ACTIVE CASES 21,87,205525 deaths in 24 hours                                     #Omicron||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/omicron-in-community-transmission-stage-third-wave-may-peak-in-fortnight-363822
24-01-2022||Mukesh Ranjan||Finally, nation's heroes honoured: PM Modi||New Delhi, January 23Targeting the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today lamented that attempts were made after Independence to ignore the contribution of several freedom fighters and asserted that the country was now correcting those mistakes.Netaji’s 125th birth anniversaryAfter Independence, attempts were made to erase the contribution of many great personalities. Today, the country is correcting those mistakes. PMAddressing a gathering after unveiling a grand digital statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at India Gate to mark his 125th birth anniversary, the PM said no power in the world could prevent the country from achieving its goal of building a “new India” before the hundredth year of Independence in 2047.Netaji’s hologram has been displayed under the India Gate canopy, which once housed the statue of King George V. The hologram, 28 feet in height and 6 feet in width, is powered by a 30,000-lumen 4K projector.The PM exhorted people to take inspiration from Netaji’s “can do” spirit. “Netaji used to say never lose faith in the dream of independent India, there is no power in the world that can shake India. We have to seek inspiration from Netaji’s ‘can do, will do’ spirit.”Modi said unfortunately attempts were made to erase the contribution of several great people after Independence. “India’s freedom struggle involved the sacrifices of lakhs of people, but attempts were made to limit their contribution. But today, decades after Independence, the country is correcting those mistakes,” he said. “We are now honouring our national heroes… have built the Statue of Unity in memory of Sardar Patel, are celebrating Bhagwan Birsa Munda’s birth anniversary as Janjatiya Gaurav Divas and have identified and restored places connected with Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. We are drawing inspiration from our great leaders,” the PM said.The hologram would soon be replaced by a big granite statue of Netaji. It would be a tribute to his immense contribution to the freedom struggle and be a symbol of the country’s indebtedness to him, the PM said.The PM also conferred the Subhas Chandra Bose Aapda Prabandhan Puraskar for the years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 in the investiture ceremony.

24-01-2022||New Delhi||China's PLA says Arunachal boy 'found', process of handing over to Indian Army on: Sources||China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on Sunday conveyed to the Indian Army that they have “found a boy” in their territory, across Arunachal Pradesh, and will hand him over soon, days after an MP had claimed that a teenager was abducted by PLA personnel.Security sources, however, said the PLA has not confirmed the identity of the boy and it is believed that the person is Miram Taron, who was allegedly taken away by the Chinese forces on January 18 from Upper Siang district.After the incident came to light, the Indian Army had sought assistance from the PLA to trace the boy.The sources said that the PLA informed the Indian Army that they found a boy and due procedure is being followed to hand him over to the Indian side.Tapir Gao, a member of Parliament (MP) from Arunachal Pradesh, also told PTI that he got the confirmation from the Indian Army that the boy is in PLA’s custody and will be handed over soon.On January 19, Gao had claimed that Taron was abducted by the PLA from Lungta Jor area under Siyungla area (Bishing village) of Upper Siang district.Taron’s friend Johny Yaiying informed the authorities about the kidnapping by the PLA. Both are local hunters belonging to Zido village.The incident occurred near the place where Tsangpo river enters India in Arunachal Pradesh. Tsangpo is called as Siang in Arunachal Pradesh and Brahmaputra in Assam.On January 20, China’s Foreign Ministry said it was not aware of the incident but said the PLA controls the borders and cracks down on “illegal entry and exit activities”. In September 2020, the PLA had abducted five youths from Arunachal Pradesh’s Upper Subansiri district. The youths were released about a week later by the PLA.The latest incident came at a time when the Indian Army continues to be engaged in a stand-off with the PLA in Ladakh since April 2020.India shares a 3,400 km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinas-pla-says-arunachal-boy-found-process-of-handing-over-to-indian-army-on-sources-363789
