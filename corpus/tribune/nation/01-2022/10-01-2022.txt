10-01-2022||New Delhi||Mild Covid cases can be managed at home, Molnupiravir no magic drug, says AIIMS doctor||A majority of Covid patients during this Omicron-driven surge of infections have so far shown mild symptoms that can be managed at home with symptomatic treatment, an AIIMS doctor said on Monday and stressed that antiviral pill Molnupiravir is no magic drug for the disease.There is no specific drug against Covif-19 as of now and the treatment still remains symptomatic, said Dr Neeraj Nischal, an additional professor in the Department of Medicine at AIIMS.All that is needed is close supervision of patients, especially those who are at risk such as the elderly with comorbidities and those who are still not vaccinated, he said.Dr Nischal said, “Pandemic does not mean that unless your doctor prescribes multiple drugs or fancy pills you are not going to get okay. At the end of the day, patience, a positivity of mind and paracetamol will see a majority of patients through”.           “A majority of the infected patients during the third wave of Covid so far have shown mild symptoms which can be easily managed at home with symptomatic treatment,” he said.About the recently approved drug Molnupiravir, the doctor said it is being touted as a magic pill, which is not the case.“Data of this particular molecule is not that robust as is being claimed. Most importantly, the population in which the trial was conducted and the type of virus variant prevalent at that time is entirely different from today’s scenarios, Dr Nischal said.A large portion of the population is now vaccinated and the prevalent coronavirus variant is Omicron.Molnupiravir works by inducing mutation in the virus by substituting one of the components that is also present in human genetic material.“So, apart from theoretical possibility of selecting a mutant virus which could be more dangerous, it can also affect rapidly dividing cells of human beings like cells of reproductive organs in male, foetus in pregnant women, bone and cartilage of young adults and children,” the doctor explained.People must remember that this drug has been given restricted emergency use authorisation in a very selective group of patients who are at risk of developing serious disease and have no other therapeutic options, he said.“So efforts should be made to restrict the use of this drug as the known and unknown harm is much more than the limited benefit it may offer. It should not become an over-the-counter medicine and should be prescribed with due diligence.”          Indian Council of Medical Research Director-General Dr Balram Bhargava had last week said Molnupiravir has major safety concerns and has not been included in the national protocol for the treatment of Covid-19.Another drug that is being prescribed to patients is a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab and imdevimab). It must be remembered that this is not effective against Omicron and its use in the previously infected/vaccinated population is also not clear, Dr Nischal said.So, in the present context it should not be used irrationally, he underlined.One should keep faith in their immune response which can be boosted by a healthy lifestyle, vaccination and following covid appropriate behaviour, Dr Nischal said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/mild-covid-cases-can-be-managed-at-home-molnupiravir-no-magic-drug-says-aiims-doctor-360007

Police said the man's head in his thirties was severed elsewhere and later left at the feet of a deity.Though the police are probing the human sacrifice angle but feel that this could have been done to mislead the security agencies, the police have sounded an alert to find out about any missing person in the vicinity of the crime scene.Deverakonda DSP Anand Reddy said the head was found is on the highway and is a worship place for Mahankali and located on the state highway between state Capital Hyderabad and Nagarjuna Sagar.Forensic teams were called along with the dog squad, but after some distance, the dogs got confused and did not move further. The police suspect that this happened because the accused probably came on a vehicle and left the head, and fled in the vehicle. Reddy said that from the state of the human head, it appears that the man was beheaded on Sunday night.Wherever CCTV camera footage is available, the same is being analysed by the police for clues. The pictures of the victim have been flashed all over Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and other neighbouring states. Once the person's identity is established, the police hope to get a significant clue to crack the case. As of now, a case of murder has been registered, and investigations are continuing, police have said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/severed-head-found-at-mahakali-temple-359994

Maps produced with older technology lost their readability and feeling experience within a very short span.According to available information, approximately 40 million people in India, including 1.6 million children, are blind or visually impaired. India is also said to be home to over 20 per cent of the world’s blind population. A number of initiatives have been launched over the years by the government to redress their requirements, including medicare and access to public facilities.NATMO started producing Braille maps in 1997 and published a Braille Atlas for Visually Impaired (India), in 2017 in English Braille script, which received a huge response from the visually impaired community. It was developed with an indigenous manual embossing method.NATMO received unexpected and overwhelming demand for Braille atlases and this led it to prepare Braille atlases in Hindi and other regional languages. This organisation has started preparation of Braille atlases of different states of India in consultation with experts and associated organisations.NATMO has developed a Braille unit, which is expected to launch soon, having state-of-art cutting edge solutions such as artificial intelligence (AI) and spot ultra-violet (UV) coating methods for digital embossing. The complete process undergoes different stages with end-to-end solution in digital platform.Primarily thematic maps are prepared on digital platforms using GIS technology. The hard copy products are then laminated with soft sheets. The soft laminated maps are placed onto the embossing digital devices with perfect registration for UV coating. Soft copy maps are masked in the area of interest for embossing. AI technology is used for 3-D embossing to get the final Braille maps. Complete map sets are bound spirally for the easy use of the visually impaired.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/better-quality-easier-to-use-braille-maps-made-by-using-new-indigenous-technology-coming-soon-359992

10-01-2022||New Delhi||India looking forward to constructive dialogue: Sources on military talks with China||India is looking forward to “constructive” dialogue with China to resolve issues in remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh, sources in the security establishment said on Monday ahead of the 14th round of military talks between the two sides on the 20-month row.The talks will take place on January 12 at the Chushul-Moldo meeting point, on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh, the sources said.The ‘Senior Highest Military Commander Level (SHMCL)’ talks will begin at 9.30 am, they said.“Indian side is looking forward to constructive dialogue to resolve the balance friction areas,” a source said.It is learnt that major focus of the talks will be on disengagement in the Hot Springs area.The Indian side is expected to press for disengagement as soon as possible in all the remaining friction points, including resolution of issues in Depsang Bulge and Demchok.The 13th round of talks had taken place on October 10, 2021 and they ended in a stalemate.Both sides failed to make any headway in the talks with the Indian Army saying after the dialogue that the “constructive suggestions” made by it were neither agreeable to the Chinese side nor it could provide any “forward-looking” proposals.In their virtual diplomatic talks on November 18, India and China agreed to hold the 14th round of military talks at an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement in remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5, 2020, following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas.Both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process last year in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake and in the Gogra area.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.

10-01-2022||New Delhi||5-10% Covid cases requiring hospitalisation this time, but situation may change: Centre||Five to 10 per cent of the active Covid cases this time so far needed hospitalisation but the situation is dynamic and may change rapidly, the Centre said on Monday and asked states to keep a watch on cases under home isolation and in hospitals.During the second surge of Covid infections in the country, the percentage of active cases that needed hospital care were in the range of 20-23 per cent, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a letter to states and Union territories.The rise in COVID-19 cases in various parts of the country appears to be driven by the Omicron variant as well as by the continued presence of Delta, he said and stressed on augmenting human resources, particularly healthcare workers, for Covid management.“In the present surge, five to 10 per cent of active cases needed hospitalisation so far. The situation is dynamic and evolving. Therefore, the need for hospitalization may also change rapidly,” Bhushan said.All states and Union Territories are advised to keep a daily watch on the situation of the total number of active cases, cases under home isolation, the number of hospitalized cases, cases on oxygen beds, ICU beds and on ventilatory support, he wrote.“Based on this monitoring, the requirement of healthcare workers and their availability health facility wise must also be reviewed daily as was done during the second surge,” the health secretary said.Appreciating that while various states and Union Territories initiated steps for the establishment of jumbo health facilities, field hospitals, temporary hospitals among others, Bhushan said both infrastructure and human resources have their limitations.Therefore, it is important to conserve health care workers by initiating staggering wherever possible and by restricting elective procedures in the hospitals, he advised.It is also important to strictly follow the advisory, issued by the Health Ministry on January 9, for managing healthcare workers in Covid and non-Covid areas of healthcare facilities.The ministry has suggested states and Union Territories to earmark different categories of beds in private clinical establishments for Covid care.“It must also be ensured that charges levied by such health facilities are reasonable and there is a mechanism to monitor and initiate action in cases of over-charging if any,” Bhushan said in the letter.He also suggested engaging retired medical professionals or MBBS students for teleconsultation services and providing skill training of community volunteers in basic care and management at Covid Care Centres.The health secretary also suggested requisition of additional ambulances or private vehicles to improve referral transport and facilitate seamless transfer of COVID-19 cases from home isolation or from Covid Care Centres to Covid Dedicated Hospitals.All district hospitals and medical college hospitals should be used as eSanjeevani teleconsultation hubs. Requisite financial resources for this have already been provided under ECRP-II to states and Union Territories, Bhushan said in the letter.

I will see what steps are to be taken next. I have also resigned from the BJP,” Lobo told reporters.Asked whether he will join the Congress, Lobo said he is in talks with other political parties.He claimed that people were unhappy with the ruling BJP in the coastal state.“The voters told me that the BJP is no more a party of the common people,” he said, while claiming that the grass-root level workers were feeling ignored by the party.However, Goa BJP president Sadanand Shet Tanavade said Lobo’s decision to leave the party will have no impact on its prospects in the upcoming state polls.Lobo had left the party long back and he was “only physically present with us,” Tanavade said.He may have left, but other workers in the Calangute Assembly constituency are with the party, he said.The BJP will field a fresh candidate to retain the Calangute Assembly seat in the elections, Tanavade said.The Election Commission of India on Saturday announced that elections to all 40 Assembly constituencies in Goa would be held on February 14.The BJP, Congress, Goa Forward Party (GFP), Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Trinamool Congress Party (TMC), and NCP are the main political parties in the fray.In the 2017 Goa Assembly polls, the Congress had emerged as the single largest party, but it failed to form government.The BJP had then tied-up with some regional outfits and independents to form government.The Congress currently has only two MLAs in the state.

10-01-2022||New Delhi||TMC MP O’Brien seeks parliamentary panel meeting on ‘Tek Fog’ app||TMC Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien has written to the chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs seeking a meeting of the panel to discuss the issue of “hijacking and manipulating” social media trends using ‘Tek Fog’ app which he said is a “threat” to national security and privacy of citizens.This is the second letter the TMC MP has written to Congress leader and panel head Anand Sharma for a meeting.A report on news portal ‘The Wire’ had alleged that people associated with the ruling BJP’s IT cell were purportedly using the app to take control of inactive WhatsApp accounts, send messages to frequently contacted numbers, and “hijack” trending topics on social media platforms.In his letter on Monday, O’Brien said that the exposé shows that the Tek Fog app gives cyber troops the ability to hijack WhatsApp accounts of private citizens by sending them spyware disguised as a media file. It then remotely accesses inactive accounts in their contact lists and uses the inactive number to send targeted messages to all their contacts.“All of the hijacked number’s contacts are synced to a database on cloud, ripe for picking as future targets of disinformation and harassment... It is also pointed out that this hacking technique was formerly used by the Pegasus spyware, before the NSO Group developed an even more sophisticated zero-click hijacking method,” he said.He said that the application can automate the sending of WhatsApp messages across networks of groups, flooding the social media space with misinformation and fake news, misleading individual citizens, and manipulating political narratives.“Use of such manipulative technology is a danger to national security and democratic rights of free speech and unfettered media, and a threat to individual citizens’ privacy and safety. I, therefore, request you to call a meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs at the earliest, to discuss these developments,” said O’Brien who is also the leader of the TMC’s Parliamentary Party in Rajya Sabha and a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs.

10-01-2022||Aditi Tandon||India likely to cross second wave peak but fully prepared, hospitalisations low: Sources||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 10India will likely cross the peak of the second Covid wave but is fully prepared to handle the surge, government sources assured on Monday as daily cases neared 1.8 lakh (1,79,723) and active cases jumped to 7,23,619 as against 5,90,611 on Sunday.At the height of the second wave, India had recorded 4,40,000 daily cases on May 7, the highest since the onset of the pandemic.Government sources said though the current trajectory of the surge worldwide (US reporting 8 lakh cases a day, France 3 lakh, UK 2 lakh) indicates that India is "bound to cross the 4.4 lakh daily cases it hit at the peak of the second wave, there is no cause to panic as the government’s preparation this time is two to three fold higher than that in 2021."Also, omicron infection continues to be mild with nearly 40 per cent of India’s current omicron patients (4,031 as of Monday) fully recovered.  “The infection in the current wave appears to be mild and people who get Covid should recover easily following the home isolation guidelines put up on the health ministry website,” said a government source adding that hospitalisations in the current wave are one fourth of what was seen in the second wave, if Delhi alone is taken as a test case.The health ministry data show the country’s medical oxygen capacity since the height of the second wave has also doubled from 9,500 MT on May 27, 2021 to 19,236 MT a day.“The highest number of fresh cases India saw was around 4 lakh on May 7. We are bound to cross that but are much better prepared to deal with Covid than we were in 2021. The medical oxygen capacity available today is double of the peak of the second wave (9,500 MT on May 25). We do not know if we will even need that much medical oxygen with omicron as it is an upper respiratory tract infection. As a country we are prepared two to three times on all indicators,” a senior government official said adding that people need to mask up to protect them from getting sick.Government sources said many modelling studies had been done in India to predict the peak and evidence from South Africa, which first reported omicron, shows the case graph rises with alarming steep and then falls with an equal velocity.The situation is evolving all over the world but we need to be prepared for no matter what the numbers are, a source said, with another adding that the US is seeing 8 lakh cases a day, France 3 lakh a day and the UK 2 lakh a day.“The message is that there is no cause for panic. We may cross the figures of the second wave but we are prepared to take up any challenge. This infection is mild and will subside with precautions and home isolation,” an official said.Omicron-induced Covid cases worldwide were the highest on January 7 since the start of the pandemic in early 2020.The government on Monday cited a WHO advisory which says omicron has a growth advantage over delta with a doubling time of two to three days and the incidence of new cases is much higher.Official sources said masking is a great protection along with vaccination.A US Centre for Disease Control study has shown that an infectious dose of Covid spreads in 15 minutes if neither the patient nor the one at risk are wearing a mask.If both are wearing a loosely fitted N 95 mask, infection will take 25 hours to spread and if they are wearing tightly sealed masks they will get 2,500 hours of protection.“The message is mask up. Even a triple-layer mask is good. Some protection is good,” said an official noting that daily new cases had risen over 28 times since omicron was reported in late November and daily positivity rate has gone up from less than 1 per cent for several months to 13.27 per cent on Monday.It was 7.9 per cent for the whole of last week.However, India has yet seen one death from omicron in Rajasthan.Overall, India has reported 4,031omicron cases as of Monday with 1,552 recoveries.No reason to panic: Why*India is much better placed today than during the second wave to tackle Covid.

Because his fellowship came from the Ministry of Agriculture of the Government of India, Khorana was initially slated to work at an Institute in Berkshire, England, to study insecticides and fungicides. However, with the end of the Second World War, most educational institutes in the UK were crowded because of the influx of a large number of veterans returning home to finish their education. Since Khorana had a master’s degree in organic chemistry, the Indian High Commissioner’s Office in London decided that he might as well work for a PhD in organic chemistry instead of studying insecticides and fungicides. In Liverpool, Khorana received a PhD in 1948,” Raj Bhandary says in the issue Congress veteran Jairam Ramesh shared on Twitter.The publication speaks of Khorana’s tenacity -- how he simply showed up in the laboratory of Vladimir Prelog in Zurich (a Nobel winner), with no recommendations, pleaded for space to do postdoctoral research under him and got accepted; how his determination to learn the German language introduced him to a world of chemical reagents which proved pivotal to much of his early work and how he ended up in Vancouver for his first position as an independent investigator after failing to get a job in India where he returned in 1949.Khorana had become an independent investigator at British Columbia Research Council (BCRC), University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada, by 1952 and there was no looking back.As Umesh Varshney of the Indian Institute of Science explains about his late friend, “Gobind made the best use of the opportunities that came along. That was true of the opportunity to do a Master’s in chemistry at Punjab University, Lahore (then a part of India), a PhD at the University of Liverpool, UK, a post-doctoral research with Vladimir Prelog at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. It was equally true during his independent research career at Vancouver, Madison and Cambridge.”By 1960, Khorana had moved from Vancouver to the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where he accomplished his Nobel winning work.The publication, while saluting Khorana’s spirit, reproduces his own words: “I have met people who believed they knew at a very young age what they wanted to do in their lives. I envied them, but my own life was not like that…” Khorana’s life was a sum of the opportunities he never lost.The scientist passed away on November 9, 2011.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scientist-who-taught-us-to-be-modest-except-in-our-aim-359832

We have taken up the matter with the US authorities and urged them to investigate this violent incident,” said the Consulate General of India in New York.The US State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs (SCA) said in a social media post that it was “deeply disturbed” by reports of an apparent attack on a Sikh cab driver at the JFK Airport, captured on video last week. “Our diversity makes the US stronger and we condemn any form of hate-based violence,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-to-probe-attack-on-sikh-taxi-driver-359804

Jaishankar only posted about a “wide-ranging conversation with my Iranian colleague” during which they “discussed the difficulties of Covid, challenges in Afghanistan, prospects of Chabahar and complexities of the Iranian nuclear issue.”In case the issue was taken up, it marks an expensive change of strategy. The government would be faced with the prospect of diverting the wheat to the ports and would have to arrange for containers at a time when their availability is tight and freight rates are high.Even if the costs are met, the conditions earlier cited by MEA officials for not transporting wheat via Iran still remain valid. The foremost is the reluctance among shippers and reinsurance agents to touch a consignment destined for Iran as they fear getting entangled in the web of sanctions announced by the US. Even if that reluctance was surmounted, officials had pointed out the lack of infrastructure in Nimroz province of Afghanistan to cater to the huge consignment of wheat. In contrast, entry points from Pakistan into Afghanistan have well-oiled mechanisms in this regard.A week back, the MEA had said: “In (the) coming weeks, we will be undertaking the supply of wheat and the remaining medical assistance. In this regard, we are in touch with UN agencies and others to finalise the modalities for transportation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-mulls-iran-option-for-wheat-to-afghanistan-359795

When the crew members of the boat failed to justify their presence in Indian waters, the ICG ship apprehended it, the ICG said in a release.The boat tried to flee towards the Pakistani waters, but due to the quick response by the ICG ship, it was made to stop and apprehended, said the ICG. Around 2,000 kg fish and 600 litres of diesel were seized from the boat, the ICG said, adding that the boat was registered at Keti Bandar in Pakistan.Sometimes, Pakistani fishing boats cross the notional international maritime boundary and enter Indian waters during fishing expeditions. There has also been a rise in cases of such boats being used to smuggle contraband drugs through the Gujarat coast. The Indian Coast Guard had on September 15 last year apprehended a Pakistani boat with 12 crew members in the Indian waters off the Gujarat coast.On December 20, a Pakistani fishing boat with six crew members on board and carrying 77 kg of heroin worth around Rs 400 crore was apprehended in the Indian waters off the Gujarat coast by the ICG in a joint operation with the state Anti-Terrorist Squad. — PTIIn Indian waters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-boat-with-10-of-crew-seized-off-gujarat-coast-359786

Among them were Harjit Grewal and Surjit Jyani of the BJP; minister Vijay Inder Singla, former minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, former MLAs Harmander Jassi and Mangat Rai Bansal of the Congress; AAP’s Bathinda (Urban) candidate Jagroop Gill; and SAD candidate from Dirba Gulzar Singh.The leaders tried to downplay their visit, claiming there was nothing political about it. Significantly, dera’s political affairs committee chairman Ram Singh and state committee members were at the function too.The dera authorities are keeping their cards close to their chest, saying they would announce support to parties or candidates at the “appropriate” time.However, sources said the dera was unlikely to announce support for any party. Its strategy would be to back certain candidates on specific seats. Talking to The Tribune, dera spokesperson Harcharan Singh said, “It was a religious event. There was nothing political about it. Today’s congregation was in memory of dera’s second head Shah Satnam. However, the followers are angry over the implication of their head in sacrilege cases.”The dera can influence the election outcome in about 40 constituencies in Malwa. It has 84 branches in Punjab, 11 of these, including the biggest at Salabatpura, in Bathinda district. Therefore, leaders of Malwa have begun to reach out to the dera followers. A pink robe worn by Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh during a congregation at Salabatpura on May 13, 2007, had triggered a row. He was accused of ‘imitating’ Guru Gobind Singh. Influence in MalwaWooing supportCong: Minister Vijay Inder Singla, former minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, ex-MLAs Harmander Jassi and Mangat Rai BansalBJP: Harjit Singh Grewal, former state minister Surjit JyaniAAP: Jagroop Singh Gill, Bathinda (Urban) candidateSAD: Gulzar Singh, Dirba candidate||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-poll-2022-leaders-rush-to-dera-to-seek-blessings-359772

The notification provided 27 per cent reservation to Other Backward Classes and 10 per cent to Economically Weaker Sections in All India Quota (AIQ) Scheme of the Centre for undergraduate and postgraduate medical, dental courses from the academic year 2021-22.The petitions challenged the applicability of Rs 8-lakh annual income limit for the EWS beneficiaries while calling for merit-based admissions with minimum reservation in medical PG courses. The Supreme Court on Friday passed an interim order allowing the reservations and said there was an urgent need to commence counselling.“In accordance with the assurance given to resident doctors by the Health Ministry and following the Supreme Court orders, the Medical Counselling Committee will commence counselling for NEET-PG admissions from January 12. This will boost India’s efforts to fight Covid-19. Congratulations to all aspirants,” Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya tweeted today.On July 29 last year, the Centre had announced 27 per cent and 10 per cent reservation (for both UG and PG courses) for students taking admission against all-India quota seats in the state-level medical and dental colleges.The AIQ Scheme was introduced in 1986 under the directions of the Supreme Court to provide domicile-free, merit-based opportunities to students from any state aspiring to study in a good medical college located in another state. The AIQ consists of 15 per cent of the total available UG and 50 per cent of the total available postgraduate seats in government medical colleges. Initially, there was no reservation in the AIQ Scheme up to 2007. In 2007, the SC introduced a reservation of 15 per cent for SCs and 7.5 per cent for STs in the AIQ Scheme.When the Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act became effective in 2007 providing for uniform 27 per cent reservation to OBCs, the same was implemented in Central Educational Institutions, namely Safdarjung Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, Banaras Hindu University and others. But this was not extended to the AIQ seats of state medical and dental colleges. The July 29, 2021, notification filled the gap.The decision will annually benefit 1,500 OBC students in MBBS and 2,500 OBC students in PG courses, besides 550 EWS students in MBBS and 1,000 EWS students in PG courses.With the counselling set to commence, medical colleges will have a fresh pool of NEET-PG students to be enlisted in the fight against Covid-19.Resident doctors across various colleges had been protesting the delay in NEET-PG counselling.

The photos of the Muslim women were uploaded by the group members,” the officer said.Investigation has revealed that the accused had joined the group on Twitter by the name of ‘Tradmahasabha’ in January 2020 using the handle @gangescion.During various group discussions, the members had talked about trolling Muslim women, the police said.“He admitted that he had developed the code/app on GitHub. After the uproar regarding the Sulli Deals app, he had deleted all his social media footprints,” the DCP said.The Delhi Police said that further analysis of technical gadgets is underway to find out the codes/images related to the app.Earlier in July, a case was registered by the Cyber Cell of the Delhi Police after it received a complaint about an unidentified group uploading photos of Muslim women on an app.Delhi Police PRO Chinmoy Biswal had earlier said, “Acting on a complaint received on the National Cybercrime Reporting Portal regarding “Sulli Deals” mobile application, a case under section 354-A of the Indian Penal Code has been registered and investigation taken up.”        The Indore police on Sunday said their Delhi counterparts have not shared any information with them about the arrest.However, Indore’s Police Commissioner Harinarayanchari Mishra told PTI, “We have come to know only from the media about the arrest of Thakur from Indore by Delhi Police. The Delhi Police have not shared any official information with us in this regard so far.”            Mishra also said that the Indore police will consider starting an investigation into the matter after the Delhi Police share with them details of the case.In “Bulli Bai” case, the Delhi Police on January 1 had registered an FIR in connection with an online complaint submitted by a city-based woman journalist against unknown persons for allegedly uploading her doctored picture on a portal.According to Delhi Police, Niraj Bishnoi (21) who was arrested from Assam was the alleged mastermind and creator of the “Bulli Bai” application. He had disclosed during interrogation that he was in touch with the person behind the Twitter handle @sullideals, the alleged creator of the “Sulli Deals” app that was hosted on GitHub in July last year.

10-01-2022||New York||Attack on Sikh cabbie 'deeply disturbing', says Indian Consulate in New York; takes up matter with US authorities||Terming the assault on a Sikh taxi driver at the JFK International Airport as “deeply disturbing”, India’s Consulate General here said that it has taken up the matter with the US authorities and urged them to investigate the incident.“The assault against a Sikh taxi driver in New York is deeply disturbing. We have taken up the matter with US authorities and urged them to investigate this violent incident,” the Consulate General of India in New York tweeted on Saturday. An undated 26-second video uploaded by Navjot Pal Kaur on Twitter on January 4, showed a man assaulting the Sikh taxi driver outside the airport.Kaur said in a tweet that the video was shot by a bystander at the airport.The person can be heard allegedly using expletives against the victim. He repeatedly hits and punches him and knocks off his turban.“This video was taken by a bystander at John F. Kennedy International Airport. I do not own the rights to this video. But I just wanted to highlight the fact that hatred continues to remain in our society and unfortunately, I’ve seen Sikh cab drivers get assaulted again and again,” Kaur tweeted. Further details about the driver or the cause of the incident were not available.The video has led to angry reactions by the community members. “Another Sikh cab driver assaulted. This one at JFK Airport in NYC. So upsetting to see. But it’s crucial that we don’t look away… What I am sure of is how painful it is to watch our fathers and elders get assaulted while they’re just trying to live an honest life.“For those who aren’t Sikh, I can’t put into words what it means to have your turban knocked off — or to see someone else’s turban knocked off. It’s visceral and gut-wrenching and just so disheartening to witness,” Simran Jeet Singh, author and Director for the Aspen Institute’s Inclusive America Project, tweeted.The National Sikh Campaign said, “We are only a few days into the new year and there has already been a hate crime committed against a Sikh. A bystander recorded an unidentified man attacking a Sikh taxi driver, ultimately knocking off the driver’s turban.”                “No additional details have been released outside of the video, but we know this story too well. A Sikh person goes about their daily lives only to be senselessly attacked by someone. Common road rage between people can escalate when someone who is ignorant of who we are takes their disdain for our turbans and becomes violent,” it said.This is not the first time a Sikh taxi driver has been assaulted in the US.An Indian-origin Sikh Uber driver was in 2019 assaulted and racially abused in the US state of Washington in a suspected hate crime.The driver told the police that he believes his race promoted the attack.In 2017, a 25-year-old Sikh cab driver in New York was assaulted and his turban knocked off by drunk passengers.
