The Andhra Pradesh Chief Secretary assured the Bench that in all cases where applicants had not received compensation will reviewed and he was ready to face contempt if it was not done.The Bench said, “We trust and hope that the Chief Secretary will stand by what he has assured this court.”On behalf of Andhra Pradesh Government, senior counsel R Basant said the state received 49,292 applications of which 31,000 were found to be eligible while 6,000 were rejected. He said 28,000 claimants had received payment.On behalf of Bihar Chief Secretary, advocate Abhinav Mukherjee submitted that all attempts will be made to reach out to the poor and illiterate so that they can make their applications.Doubting the Covid-19 death figures in Bihar, the Bench during the pre-lunch hearing said, “We are not going to believe that only 12,000 people died in Bihar due to Covid. We want your chief secretary to be here virtually at 2 pm.”                                     #claim                                     #Covid19                                     #pandemic                                     #SupremeCourt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-covid-compensation-claim-can-be-rejected-on-technical-grounds-says-sc-362676

As a matter of fact this stance has become habitual, unmindful of all lawful objections towards this office or rule of law," the letter said. The governor wrote, ".. The chief secretary is provided a last opportunity to provide his comprehensive response regarding the above mentioned matter at the earlier, in any case not later than seven days from the receipt of this communication ... Failing which it will be presumed that he is working in complete disregard of the lawful directives of this office and that his actions are in deliberations and international violation of the All India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968, as a result of which serious consequences will follow in due course,"  he added. Dhankhar had on January 8 summoned chief secretary H K Dwivedi and state DGP Manoj Malaviya for an update on the alleged incident on the previous day when Adhikari was stopped from attending a programme in Netai in Jhargram district. Dhankhar, whose move was prompted by a complaint by Adhikari to Raj Bhavan, had also sought a written report from the two officers. They had skipped meeting Dhankhar first on January 10 stating that they were "in isolation" and also on January 12 and neither the additional chief secretary, home, nor any police officer next to the DGP had appeared before Dhankhar to provide the update. Adhikari had claimed that he was stopped by the police from going to Netai in Jhargram despite the Calcutta High Court order that there should be no restrictions on his movement. The BJP leader had gone to Bhimpur where he was supposed to pay his respects to the nine persons who were killed on January 7, 2011, in firing from an alleged CPI-M activist's house during the erstwhile Left Front regime.                                        #chiefsecretary                                     #Governor                                     #JagdeepDhankar                                     #letter                                     #standoff                                     #WestBengal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-governor-jagdeep-dhankhar-gives-7-day-deadline-to-chief-secretary-for-his-reply-calls-it-his-last-opportunity-362669

The band on which altimeter works is close to that on which 5G system works.Total three carriers—American Airlines, Delta Airlines and Air India—currently operate direct flights between India and the US.American Airlines and Delta Airlines did not respond to PTI’s queries regarding this matter.Air India stated on Twitter that it won’t be operate eight India-US flights on Wednesday “due to deployment of the 5G communications in the US”.These eight Air India flights were: Delhi-New York, New York-Delhi, Delhi-Chicago, Chicago-Delhi, Delhi- San Francisco, San Francisco-Delhi, Delhi-Newark and Newark-Delhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/5g-scare-air-india-cancels-8-us-flights-dgca-working-to-overcome-situation-362658

19-01-2022||Johannesburg||Omicron wave may cut future severity of Covid-19 disease: Study||The Omicron variant of coronavirus may reduce the incidence of severe Covid-19 disease, and the infection may become less disruptive to individuals and society in the future, according to a study conducted by researchers in South Africa.The findings of the yet-to-be peer-reviewed study are consistent with the previous observations of Omicron displacing Delta, since the variant can elicit immunity which neutralises Delta.The researchers from Africa Health Research Institute observed in samples from 23 people infected with Omicron in November and December that the variant escapes neutralising immunity elicited by Delta infection.This indicates that Omicron can re-infect Delta-infected individuals but not vice-versa, giving Omicron an advantage over Delta, they said.“The implications of such displacement would depend on whether Omicron is indeed less pathogenic than Delta. If so, then the incidence of Covid-19 severe disease would be reduced and the infection may shift to become less disruptive to individuals and society,” they authors of the study noted.The finding is an update to the study by the same research team which found enhancement of immunity against Delta variant with Omicron infection.“We were able to add study participants to see more clearly the effect of vaccination,” Professor Alex Sigal, from Africa Health Research Institute tweeted on Tuesday.The earlier part of the study, posted on the pre-print repository MedRxiv, used data from 15 previously vaccinated and unvaccinated people who were infected with the Omicron variant.The scientists used plasma, a blood product that contains antibodies, from the participants to test the ability of the antibodies to control both Omicron and Delta in the lab—a so-called ‘neutralisation’ test.The results show a developing antibody response to Omicron, with neutralisation increasing 14-fold over this time.However, the team also observed that the participants developed some enhanced immunity against the Delta variant, with Delta neutralisation increasing 4.4-fold.The study also showed that vaccinated participants were able to mount a better neutralising response against Delta, while the response in unvaccinated participants was more variable.“Hopefully, all this means Delta is on its way out as Omicron may shut the door on Delta re-infections. Provided enough people vaccinate. The unvaccinated lose out on the extra Omicron protection and don’t gain a boost to Delta,” said Sigal.The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, was first identified in November last year in South Africa and Botswana.The variant has been shown to be highly transmissible and have extensive evasion of neutralising antibody immunity elicited by vaccination and previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.                                     #corona                                     #coronavirus                                     #Covid                                     #Omicron                                     #severe                                     #study||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/omicron-wave-may-cut-future-severity-of-covid-19-disease-study-362648

I may list it before some other bench as well,” the CJI said.Sharma said Section 61A of the Representation of People Act, which permitted the use of EVMs, was not passed by Parliament and hence cannot be imposed.“I have filed the petition which is supported with the evidence on the record. A judicial note can be taken note of the case...let the election be held through ballot papers,” the lawyer said.The plea, which made the Union Law ministry a party, sought declaration of the provision as “void, illegal and unconstitutional” as there was no provision of EVM.The upcoming assembly polls in the five states will be held between February 10 and March 10.                                      #EVMs                                     #PIL                                     #SC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-consider-hearing-pil-challenging-use-of-evms-362638

Subsequently, there have been exchanges at high levels at bilateral and multilateral fora.The inception of the India-Central Asia Dialogue at Foreign Ministers’ level, the third meeting of which was held in New Delhi from December 18 to 21 last year, provided an impetus to India-Central Asia relations. The participation of the Secretaries of National Security Councils of Central Asian countries in the Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan held in New Delhi on November 10 last year had outlined a common regional approach on Afghanistan.During the first India-Central Asia Summit, the leaders are expected to discuss steps to take forward India-Central Asia relations to newer heights. They are also expected to exchange views on regional and international issues of interest, especially the evolving regional security situation."The summit is symbolic of the importance attached by the leaders of India and the Central Asian countries to a comprehensive and enduring India-Central Asia partnership, said the MEA statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-to-hold-virtual-summit-with-5-central-asian-presidents-as-omicron-cases-rise-362631

The decision-making process and listing/delisting measures should be objective, swift, credible, evidence-based and transparent, and not for political and religious considerations,” the Indian Ambassador said.He said that a recent report of the Monitoring Team on the asset freeze exemption procedures pursuant to resolution 2560 (2020) points to the lacunae of asset freeze measures by member states, partly due to deficiencies in the existing guidelines of the Committee.                                     #DawoodIbrahim                                     #IndiaAtUN                                     #UN||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/crime-syndicate-responsible-for-1993-mumbai-blasts-enjoying-5-star-hospitality-in-pakistan-indian-envoy-at-un-362605

The Apna Dal, which had contested 11 seats last time, is demanding 36 seats, say sources.So far, the BJP has announced 109 candidates for the 403-member Uttar Pradesh Assembly. A meeting of the BJP core committee on Uttar Pradesh was held on Tuesday to discuss candidates’ names and seat sharing with the alliance partners. The central leadership is also said to be working on some change in the strategy.While Union Home Minister Amit Shah will be undertaking an extensive tour of the state beginning on January 22, almost taking the command in his hand, the source say the party has decided to be “more generous with allies and some of the incumbent legislators, who would have otherwise been axed, might also be repeated”.The BJP had earlier planned to change between 100 and 150 sitting MLAs, while the “re-think in strategy” seems to be guided by the recent exodus of key OBC leaders, including three ministers, from the Yogi Adityanath Cabinet. The party is considering limiting this number to 40-50 even though internal surveys have suggested a bigger change to tackle the anti-incumbency factor and a resurgent Samajwadi Party, say the sources. So far, in the first two phases, the BJP has dropped 20 MLAs.                                     #UPpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assembly-polls-2022-bjp-finalises-seat-sharing-formula-with-allies-in-up-362403

Last year, you said that it was due to infrastructural problems that the intake of women would be less. Now, again for the year 2022, you have proposed to take the same number of women candidates. Why have you fixed this figure? You have to explain this. Nineteen seats can’t be for all times to come. It was only an ad hoc measure,” said a Bench led by Justice SK Kaul.The top court had on September 22 last year permitted female candidates to appear for the NDA Exam for the first time. On October 7, it also allowed female candidates to appear in the examination for Rashtriya Indian Military College (RIMC), Dehradun. Asking Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati to place on record the total number of candidates, including women, who appeared in the NDA Examination 2021 and for RIMC and Rashtriya Military School (RMS) entrance tests, the top court posted the matter for further hearing on March 6.Bhati said the intake of female candidates in the NDA, RIMC and RMS didn’t only depend on infrastructure but on several other factors, including the requirement of defence forces. Maintaining that it understood not all fields were open to women in defence forces, the Bench said there would not be an equal number of men and women as of now and it would take time. On behalf of petitioner Kush Kalra, senior advocate Chinmoy Pradip Sharma said as per the advertisement issued by the UPSC, the NDA would take in 400 cadets in the current NDA-II 2021 intake.“Of these, 208 candidates, including 10 women, will go to the Army. The Navy will take in 42 candidates, including 3 women, while the IAF will admit 120 candidates, of which 6 will be women. Thus, the total number of women to be inducted into the NDA in June 2022 is 19,” Sharma said.Sharma said that it could be seen from the reading of the Examination Notice, December 22, 2021, that the number of women candidates to be inducted in January 2023 continues to remain 19.He said in the affidavit dated September 20, 2021, filed by the Centre, it had been categorically stated that necessary steps would be in place by May 2022. “Furthermore, for the first time it is mentioned that the intake in the Naval Academy is for 30 male candidates only. The said restriction is arbitrary,” he submitted. In the November 14 NDA exam, 8,009 candidates qualified for the SSB test as also medical tests, out of which 1,002 were women, Sharma said.                                     #NDA||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-just-19-women-for-nda-asks-supreme-court-362400

This will facilitate immediate action for containment such as setting up of containment zones, contact tracing, quarantine and isolation. The mortality and morbidity can also be reduced,” Arti Ahuja, Additional Secretary (health), said in a letter to states.The progression of the disease to a severe category could be averted through strategic testing of those at high risk and more vulnerable as well as in areas where the spread was likely to be higher, she said.The ministry asked the states and the UTs to test all symptomatic people and the at-risk (over 60-plus and the ones with comorbidities) contacts of confirmed cases.The government flagged 8.31 per cent rise in Omicron cases since Monday while the daily positivity rate stood at 14.43 per cent.

It is a fraud of Congress, by Congress (and) for Congress. The Congress must explain how the Cabinet was kept in the dark and how it took six years for the fraud deal to be cancelled. The party has no right to speak about crony capitalism,” said the minister while speaking about the complications resulting from the joint venture Devas struck in 2005 with Antrix, an ISRO unit.A day earlier, the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal filed by Devas and upheld orders by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) asking the promoters to wind up the company as the deal with Antrix was steeped in fraud.Fraud by CongThe Congress must explain how the Cabinet was kept in the dark and how it took six years for the fraud to be detected. Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance MinisterBut Sitharaman’s ire was directed at the UPA regime for taking six years to cancel the Devas-Antrix deal as well as the ignominy suffered to India’s image after international courts ordered the seizing of government property abroad to implement arbitration awards of over $1.1 billion. Devas and its investors had approached the international arbitration panel after the UPA government had cancelled the Devas-Antrix joint venture over the stink it raised.Though Sitharaman only spoke of fighting the issue out and gave no details pending inter-ministerial consultations, the Supreme Court terming the deal as fraud will be of assistance to the government in its legal battles abroad where Devas is trying to enforce the arbitration awards by seeking the seizure of Indian assets such as those owned by Air India.The apex court had said on Monday that the commercial relationship between Antrix and Devas was a “product of fraud perpetrated by Devas, every part of the plant that grew out of those seeds, such as the agreement, disputes, arbitral awards, etc., are all infected with the poison of fraud”. It also noted how Devas brought in an investment of Rs 579 crore but “siphoned off” Rs 488 crore.Asked what the present government had done so far, Sitharaman said it was pursuing the company law cases through the courts and did not reply when asked if the arbitration courts would listen to the government since no one had been convicted in the cases filed by the ED and the CBI.However, a statement by Devas shareholders described the seizure of Air India’s assets in Canada as “just a start”. “Additional actions are forthcoming that will underscore that India is an unsafe place to invest in. Using government agencies to launch bogus criminal investigations against Devas will be seen around the world for what it is—an Indian government willing to debase the country’s reputation by lashing out at its victims rather than paying what it owes them,’’ it alleged in the statement.2005 spectrum deal that was cancelled2005 ISRO unit Antrix signs a deal with Devas for providing multimedia services to mobile users2011 UPA govt annuls deal over allegations of fraud2021 NCLT orders liquidation of Devas2022 SC upholds the liquidation orderEyeing Indian assetsDevas shareholders are pursuing Indian assets abroad.

19-01-2022||New Delhi||Hackers exploiting Google Docs, Outlook users at most risk||Hackers are sending malicious links through comments in Google apps like Docs and Slides primarily to Outlook users—a known vulnerability that has not been fully closed or mitigated by Google since last year, cyber-security researchers have warned.According to US-based enterprise cybersecurity company Avanan, hackers are increasingly using Google Docs' productivity features to slip malicious links past spam filters and cyber security tools.In June last year, Avanan reported on an exploit in Google Docs that allowed hackers to easily deliver malicious phishing websites to end-users. Now, hackers have found a new way to do the same thing."Starting in December 2021, Avanan observed a new, massive wave of hackers leveraging the comment feature in Google Docs, targeting primarily Outlook users," said researcher Jeremy Fuchs.The comment feature across the Google suite has become an attack vector for hackers, he claimed in a report.Avanan said it notified Google of this flaw on January 3, via the report phish through email button within Gmail.Google was yet to react to the report.In one such attack, hackers add a comment to a Google Doc. The comment mentions the target with an '@'. By doing so, an email is automatically sent to that person's inbox."In that email, which comes from Google, the full comment, including the bad links and text, is included. Further, the email address isn't shown, just the attackers' name, making this ripe for impersonators," said the report that came out on Thursday."In this email attack, hackers found a way to leverage Google Docs, and other Google collaboration tools, to send malicious links. We primarily saw it target Outlook users, though not exclusively. It hit over 500 inboxes across 30 tenants, with hackers using over 100 different Gmail accounts," it elaborated.To guard against these attacks, before clicking on Google Docs comments, users should cross-reference the email address in the comment to ensure it's legitimate."Utilise standard cyber hygiene, including scrutinising links and inspecting grammar and deploy protection that secures the entire suite, including file-sharing and collaboration apps," said the researchers.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/science-technology/hackers-exploiting-google-docs-outlook-users-at-most-risk-359083
