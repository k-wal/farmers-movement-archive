The BJP especially is hand in glove with Tek Fog. But what is India’s IT and telecom minister up to? Why has the ministry not woken up to how serious the issue is?” she asked at a press conference here.Shrinate said the government was earlier in denial of the Pegasus snooping issue and today, the Supreme Court is looking into the controversy.“I would urge the Supreme Court, because it is already looking into the Pegasus matter, to take suo-motu cognisance of this report as this targets Indian citizens and hurts the very foundation of our democracy,” she said.“I would urge the Supreme Court to look into it and punish those behind it in no uncertain terms because no one should have the right or the freedom to erode India’s democracy,” the Congress leader said.She alleged that some of the people associated with the app are functionaries of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of the BJP, and said the saffron party should come clean on the issue.Shrinate cited media reports to allege that Tek Fog promotes hate speeches, targets women, is abusive and helps propagate lies and hatred.She alleged that the app was used to systematically target the Congress by using a hashtag, when the Congress chief had said the party will stand with labourers after a lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus.A systematic targeting of the Tablighi Jamaat was also done by Tek Fog and that is why the issue needs to be taken seriously because it hurts the very foundation of India’s democracy, the Congress leader said.

He (Modi) would have felt good to see empty chairs. He should have given a speech to empty chairs as in UP also he has empty chairs in his meetings,” he said mockingly.Recalling his Koderma experience, he said his party men held him for hours before he could give his speech.He said he was held because not enough people had arrived.“But I went and addressed 25 people,” he said.Reiterating his remarks, he said, “I am saying that farmers should have allowed the PM to reach the empty dais and chairs.”    “At least the BJP and the PM then should have told why the three central black laws were brought and withdrawn. The country was deprived of knowing it and this is what I regret,” he said.The SP supremo was reacting to Wednesday’s incident in Punjab when the PM’s convoy had got stuck on a flyover on the Ferozepur-Moga road near Piareana village for 15-20 minutes around 30 km away from the National Martyrs Memorial in Hussainiwala in Ferozepur due to farmers blockade.He had to subsequently cancel his meeting there and return to the national capital. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/akhilesh-yadav-mocks-pm-security-breach-359125

Their individual business dealings and operations have no connection to the University,” the statement from Ashoka University said.“In keeping with the high standards for governance at Ashoka, Vineet and Pranav Gupta have already voluntarily stepped down from all Boards and Committees of the University pending the CBI case and are cooperating fully with the investigations,” the statement said.The CBI is investigating the Guptas Guptas, a Chandigarh-based pharmaceutical company and 10 others in a case involving a few banks, including the Central Bank of India. All suspects have been accused of Rs 1,626 crore fraud. Investigators conducted searches at 12 locations in Chandigarh, Panchkula, Ludhiana, Faridabad, and Delhi on December 31.The Gupta brothers are also directors of the pharmaceutical company Parabolic Drugs Ltd, which manufactures drugs and drugs intermediaries.The CBI is investigating Parabolic Drugs Ltd for allegedly forging documents to secure a loan from the State Bank of India, UCO Bank, State Bank of Patiala, ICICI Bank, IDBI Bank, State Bank of Hyderabad, Central Bank of lndia, Union Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Exim Bank, Canara Bank, and SIDBI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/charged-with-bank-fraud-ashoka-university-co-founders-gupta-brothers-step-down-from-varsity-posts-359124

But I would like to inform the PM that we had already inaugurated it earlier during the outbreak of pandemic when we needed a Covid centre. It helped us a lot. This institute is associated with the state government as well,” she said.The chief minister who also attended the PM’s programme virtually said that the state also bears a recurring expenditure of Rs 71 crore for it.“The PM will be happy to know that the state is funding 25 per cent of the project. We have also given 11 acre of land to the CNCI for the second campus,” she said.The Bengal CM, however, thanked Modi for inaugurating the campus and dedicating it to the people of the country.Banerjee also said she attended the event after being invited twice by Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandavia.Referring to her government’s decision to engage senior consultants in different departments, Banerjee told the PM that Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar is questioning the reason behind the move.“You (Modi) gave us suggestions to appoint people from outside and we have followed that. But the governor has questioned me why I took such a decision. He asked us to show him the process (followed to take the decision). He has no clue that we have followed the advice of the PM. Whatever be the political outlook, but we follow the guidelines of the Centre. We try to follow it 99 per cent,” she said.Banerjee also appealed to the PM to increase the quota for medical seats in the state.“There is a scarcity of doctors and the quota for medical seats must be increased as per the population. There is one hospital where 75 doctors are down with Covid. How will the treatment of patients be carried out?” she said.She claimed that West Bengal is No. 1 in the country in terms of administering Covid-19 vaccine doses in the state and sought more of them from the Centre.Vaccine wastage is zero in the state, she said.“We (state government) have ensured through our works that our country won’t get a bad reputation.

07-01-2022||New Delhi||Uttar Pradesh: Power corridors rife with speculations over CM if BJP voted back to power||The mega state Uttar Pradesh continues to be a hotbed of speculations and rumours ahead of the high-stake Assembly elections expected a few weeks from now.Amid the long-prevailing buzz surrounding the “underlying divide and divisions” between the Centre (Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah) and the state leadership (largely Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath), a BJP leader has made a stunning claim that former bureaucrat and vice president of the state party AK Sharma could be the next chief minister if the party is voted back to power in UP.        According to former Ghosi Lok Sabha MP Harinarayan Rajbhar, Sharma (who is said to have been “handpicked” by the prime minister to set things right during the second wave of Covid pandemic) could be the next CM of UP.The rumour of the “differences” between the state and the central leadership have been doing the rounds ever since Sharma was dispatched to the state Referring to the abrupt change of chief secretary in the state, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav added to it saying that the “real battle in UP” was between the BJP at the centre and the BJP in Lucknow.Yadav also claimed that the posting was a “revenge” of sorts by the Centre for not making AK Sharma the deputy CM.The buzz became stronger after UP Law Minister Brajesh Pathak was included in the key state election committee announced earlier this week.Though the list has Adityanath, deputy CMs Keshav Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, state BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal, much is being read into Pathak finding a place in it.Pathak, who is said to have done a lot of work to help people during the second wave of Covid pandemic, was the first BJP leader to visit Lakhimpur Kheri to meet the families of party worker Shubham Mishra and car driver Hari Om who died in the violent incident last year.Though the inclusion of Adityanath is being seen as yet another endorsement of his leadership, the buzz that “things might change if the BJP returns to power” is getting stronger.Observers see the committee as an attempt by the BJP to strike caste and regional balance amid allegations of Adityanath’s “pro-Thakur mindset”. The list includes leaders from the Brahmin community like Pathak and Deoria MP Ramapati Ram Tripathi, Uttarakhand Governor Baby Rani Maurya, a ‘Jatav’ like BSP chief Mayawati, Union minister SP Singh Baghel, Kaushambi MP Vinod Sonkar, Union minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, son of late CM Kalyan Singh Rajveer Singh from the Lodh community and Muzaffarnagar MP and Union minister Sanjiv Baliyan, a ‘Jat’ from Western UP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttar-pradesh-power-corridors-rife-with-speculations-over-cm-if-bjp-voted-back-to-power-359116
07-01-2022||---||Interfering with approved promotion breaches trust between Army, its officers, says AFT||Vijay MohanTribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 7 The Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) on Friday held that once the promotion of an officer has been approved by the competent authority, subordinate establishments are not supposed to interfere with the process by introducing suo moto riders.Directing the Army to promote a Brigadier from the Judge Advocate General’s Department to the rank of Major General, the Tribunal’s Bench comprising Justice Umesh Chandra Srivastava and Vice Admiral Abhay Raghunath Karve ruled that the act of the Army authorities in not allowing the officer to assume the charge of the next higher rank despite being properly selected without any rider cannot be justified in any manner. “It breaches the trust between an organisation like the Indian Army and its officers which is not in the interest of the organiation or the nation,” the Bench observed.Brig Javed Iqbal, a 1989 batch officer, had been placed in a non-promotable low medical category for hypertension in August 2018. In October 2020, he was considered by No. 1 Selection Board for promotion to the rank of Major General against a vacancy that was to arise in December 2020. The board’s recommendation to promote him was approved by the Government of India and the result was declassified in May 2021.A re-categorisation medical board was held in February 2021, where his blood pressure was found to be within permissible parameters, but his low medical category was retained and not upgraded. A re-medical board held in September 2021 on orders of Chief of the Army Staff, upgraded his medical category, which was also approved by the competent medical authority. However, the Director General Medical Services (Army) did not accept the upgrade citing various reasons, including the contention that he had not stated correct facts regarding his medication. The officer had contended that his medical category only prohibited him from serving at high altitude areas above 9,000 feet, where as the post to which he was to be promoted is tenable only in New Delhi.The Tribunal observed that from a perusal of the facts of the case, it was crystal clear that the officer’s selection for promotion by the board had been made knowing fully well his medical status. It was also clear that the selection was not subject to meeting medical criteria and was without any riders.“When the selection for promotion has been approved without any rider of specific medical criteria, the respondents are now not supposed to interfere with the approval of the Competent Authority by suo moto introducing a rider of meeting medical criteria, and they are only supposed to give effect to the approval by allowing the applicant to assume the rank of Major General, instead of sitting over the matter,” the Bench said. “This action of the respondents is not appreciable at all, more so, when the applicant is not only approved for promotion but is fully fit for the post from all corners,” the Bench further stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/interfering-with-approved-promotion-breaches-trust-between-army-its-officers-says-aft-359109
07-01-2022||Lucknow||BJP leaders unveil Lord Parshuram statue to counter Akhilesh’s Brahmin outreach bid||Days after Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav had offered puja at a Lord Parshuram temple here as part of his Brahmin outreach efforts, Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma and other BJP leaders on Friday inaugurated a temple of the god in the state capital.BJP MP Rita Bahuguna Joshi and her son Mayank Joshi, along with deputy CM Sharma and minister Brijesh Pathak, unveiled a statue of Lord Parshuram, venerated by many Brahmins, in Hasoveer temple in the state capital.The six-foot statue of Lord Parshuram has been brought from Rajasthan.The move is being seen as another attempt by the BJP to placate the electorally dominant Brahmin community which is believed to be unhappy with the state government.In political circles, the unveiling of Lord Parshuram statue in Lucknow during the day was seen as part of the BJP’s efforts to counter Akhilesh Yadav’s Brahmin outreach bid, but Dinesh Sharma differed.“It’s not BJP but Akhilesh who is imitating us. BJP has installed idols of Parshuram in Kanpur and other places earlier too,” Sharma told PTI.Several parks have also been named after Parshuram in different parts of Uttar Pradesh, he added.Not only Parshuram, the BJP has been honouring icons of all castes and community be it Ravi Das, Balmiki or Rana Pratap, he added.Making a concerted effort to throw the BJP out of power, Yadav had on January 2 offered puja at a temple having a 108-foot-tall statue of Parshuram in village Mahurakala on Purvanchal Express near Lucknow to attract Brahmins towards his party.Brahmins account for nearly 13 per cent of the state’s population and they are being wooed by all the major parties to brighten their chance in the assembly elections only months away from now.BSP chief Mayawati has already deployed her party’s Brahmin face SC Misra to mobilise their support to revive the 2007 social engineering formula of Dalits-Brahmins combination.The Brahmin leaders of the BJP have also been activated by the party to retain the support of the community.A large number of the BJP’s Brahmin leaders had recently met at party president JP Nadda’s residence in Delhi. Subsequently a committee was formed as part of the Brahmin outreach drive. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-leaders-unveil-lord-parshuram-statue-to-counter-akhileshs-brahmin-outreach-bid-359108

The case was filed under Disaster Management Act," Sakchi Police Station officer-in-charge (Acting) Parvez Alam said.Gudia alleged that those who had participated in the rally led by Das and Mahato did not follow health safety protocols and wear face masks, amid a surge in Covid-19 cases in the state.Jharkhand on Thursday recorded 3,704 fresh cases, which pushed the caseload in the state to 3,65,222, a health department bulletin said.In a "major security lapse", the prime minister's convoy was stranded on a flyover due to a blockade by protesters in Ferozepur on Wednesday after which he returned from poll-bound Punjab without attending any event, including a rally.Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi had on Thursday alleged that Modi's "gimmick" of "threat to his life" was aimed at "toppling a democratically elected government" in the state.He claimed there was no security lapse during Modi's visit to the state.Channi said he had himself supervised the necessary arrangements for the visit. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-jharkhand-cm-raghubar-das-among-200-bjp-leaders-activists-booked-for-covid-norm-violation-359107
07-01-2022||New Delhi||As Covid cases surge in Delhi, migrant workers fear another lockdown, loss of livelihood||With a surge in coronavirus cases in Delhi and its neighbouring cities, migrant workers and daily wagers fear another round of lockdown could push them into a severe financial crisis from which they might never recover.Delhi has already announced weekend and night curfews, among other restrictions to check crowding, as the city reports a record rise in cases months after a second wave wreaked havoc on its health system and led to a lockdown, leaving many jobless.On Thursday, the city recorded 15,097 fresh Covid cases, the highest single-day rise since May 8, and six deaths while the positivity rate mounted to 15.34 per cent, according to official figures.“My family is not worried about contracting the virus. The poor never get it. We are more worried that if there is another lockdown, we will not survive a financial crunch,” Meena Devi, a migrant labourer in Karaval Nagar, said.Besides Delhi, restrictions are in place in states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh that share borders with the national capital.However, no lockdown has been imposed and most businesses and activities, including those involving migrant workers, are working complying with Covid protocols.“Financially, we just scraped through the first and second waves” and even the mention of a complete shutdown sends jitters down the spine, said 60-year-old Pokyala, a domestic help in Lajpat Nagar.The family did not have enough food for days and as people stayed indoors, “my husband took to washing cars to eke out a living”, she said, adding that “we got some help from the Delhi government in the way of 1 kg rice and 1 kg sugar a person”.“I worked in three houses. They asked me not to come during the lockdown, and only one household paid me,” Pokyala said, adding that with three people working meagre jobs in a family of seven, a lockdown could make it difficult for paying for children’s education and food.Pokyala’s daughter-in-law said some families have not returned to Delhi since the 2020 lockdown.“Lockdown hit us badly. Work has been halved. If a lockdown happens again, I am not sure if employers will pay us for this period. I have saved some money for the marriage of my sister in February. This is all I have,” she said.In April-May last year, it was the Delta variant of the coronavirus that led to the second wave, and according to experts, the emergence of the third is due to the Omicron variant, which has a high rate of transmission.Laxmi Devi, a domestic help in East of Kailash, is already getting apprehensive about the possibility of a lockdown after the weekend curfew was announced in Delhi.“Last time, my employer didn’t cut my salary, so I managed it, but many people who live in my colony, who work in households as maids, faced a lot of problems, from managing food for survival to other basic needs,” she said.Lockdown hits the poor the hardest, said Laxmi, who hails from Bhagalpur in Bihar and had moved to Delhi 20 years ago for work.In Delhi, she stays with her two children—son (17) and daughter (15), while her husband, a painter, works in Bhagalpur.For labourers at construction sites the thought of stricter restrictions and a possible shut down of activities looms large in their minds.Kamlesh Prajapati, who works at the Barapullah Phase-3 construction site, said that so far there is no ban on construction activities but the number of workers has started reducing at construction sites.It is because of a fear of strict restrictions or possible lockdown, he said.“The vicious cycle of Covid wave has once again started. I am worried about a possible lockdown or ban on construction activities due to rising cases,” he said.“If a ban or lockdown is imposed then I will again be out of work. I am also thinking of going back to home as I don’t want to get stuck here without money,” Prajapati, a resident of Chandausi in Uttar Pradesh told PTI.Ramnath Jatav, who works at the Pragati Maidan Tunnel Project, fears that he might be jobless if the rising trend of Covid cases continues.“Pandemic is again on the rise. Thousands of cases are being reported every day. It is reminding me of the time and hardships during the second wave. I want to go back home before curbs are put on travelling,” Jatav said.Following the Covid outbreak in March 2020, a national lockdown was imposed. Last year, a second wave hit the country, with many states announcing shut down of activities to check the virus’ spread. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/as-covid-cases-surge-in-delhi-migrant-workers-fear-another-lockdown-loss-of-livelihood-359104

07-01-2022||Itanagar||Rijiju dismisses China renaming places in Arunachal; says it won't change status||Union minister Kiren Rijiju has dismissed China renaming some places in Arunachal Pradesh and asserted that renaming of places in India by someone outside the country will not change their status.The Union law and justice minister also said that such renaming will not be acceptable to anyone."Arunachal's names were given by the country and that is acceptable to all. Our traditional names, our community's identity will remain forever. If someone outside gives some new names, that will not change our status," he told reporters here on the sidelines of a function on Thursday.Rijiju was replying to a question on Beijing announcing Chinese names for 15 places in Arunachal Pradesh."If someone changes names outside the country, will we accept it? The name given by your parents is your real name. If someone changes your name forcefully, will you accept it?" he asked.India has already rejected China renaming some places in Arunachal Pradesh and asserted that the state has "always been" and will "always be" an integral part of India and that assigning "invented" names does not alter this fact.On December 29, 2021, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs announced that it had standardised in Chinese characters, Tibetan and Roman alphabet the names of 15 places in Zangnan, the Chinese name for Arunachal Pradesh, according to state-run Global Times.This is in accordance with regulations on geographical names issued by the State Council, China's cabinet, it said in a report.Among the official names of the 15 places, which were given exact longitude and latitude, eight are residential places, four are mountains, two are rivers and one is a mountain pass, the report said.This was the second batch of standardised names of places in Arunachal Pradesh given by China. The first batch of the standardised names of six places was released in 2017.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet.China's renaming of the places in Arunachal Pradesh came amidst the ongoing stand-off along the border in Ladakh which started in May 2020. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rijiju-dismisses-china-renaming-places-in-arunachal-says-it-wont-change-status-359093
07-01-2022||New Delhi||Tihar inmate swallows mobile phone, hospitalised||A prisoner at the high-security Tihar Jail in the national capital was hospitalised after he swallowed a mobile phone, an official said here on Friday.Director General (Prison) Sandeep Goel told IANS that the incident took place on January 5.“One inmate of Jail no.1, Tihar, swallowed a mobile phone when our staff approached him for search on suspicion,” the DG said.He informed that the said inmate was then immediately taken to the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital in the city.“Although his condition was fine so far but the mobile phone was still inside his body,” Goel said.The Tihar Jail has been strengthening its security arrangements following major backlash it has received over its officials being caught providing facilities to the inmates, of which the main gadget was a mobile phone.Over 40 officials at the Tihar Prison have been booked by various law enforcement agencies during the past six months for extending benefits to the prisoners in one or the other way.Goel, in an interview earlier with IANS, had said that the Tihar Jail will soon have two X-ray-based human body scanners that can prevent infiltration of illegal articles and gadgets inside the prison premises.The usage of mobile phones by inmates is a serious concern, however, can be tackled with the usage of apt technology.Goyal said they are installing three new towers inside the jail premises that would confine the mobile signals emanating from the prison.“All these measures are steps in the right direction and can prove beneficial in the future,” he added.--- IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tihar-inmate-swallows-mobile-phone-hospitalised-359089
07-01-2022||New Delhi||India to become hub for Covid-19 antiviral generic drugs: Fitch||India will become the largest global hub for Covid-19 antiviral general drug production after the drug controller granted emergency-use authorisation to several pharmaceutical companies in the country to manufacture and market generic versions of Molnupiravir, Fitch Solutions said Friday.Increased access to Molnupiravir will keep hospitalisations and deaths in India to a manageable level as Omicron infections rise, Fitch Solutions said in a report.Those granted authorisation by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) include Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Cipla, Sun Pharma, Natco Pharma, Viatris, Hetero Drugs and Mankind Pharma.Lagevrio (Molnupiravir) was developed by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, and it is the first ever oral antiviral drug for the treatment of high-risk adults with mild to moderate Covid-19.Following the authorisation, Cipla, Sun Pharma, and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories are set to release molnupiravir capsules in the coming weeks, and the rest of the companies will follow.“This will make India the largest global hub for Covid-19 antiviral generic drug productions,” it said. “The efficacy of molnupiravir during its MOVe-OUT phase III trial has been largely promising, with a 50 reduction in hospitalisation and death in early-stage infections.” However, safety concerns remain on its risk of inducing harmful mutagenesis if the drug is prescribed globally, creating the potential for new Covid-19 strains.The Covid-19 second wave in India peaked during April and May 2021 when daily averages cases topped 4 lakh. Caseloads have dropped significantly since then, with the national tally remaining one under 10,000 cases per day for the rest of the year.However, in recent days, there has been a surge in daily Covid-19 cases driven by the Omicron variant which is set to overtake Delta as the dominant variant.On January 6, 2022, Covid-19 cases increased to 1,17,100 with 3,007 of these cases confirmed as the Omicron variant, according to the Union Ministry of Health.“Moreover, India continues to lag behind in its Covid-19 Vaccine rollout target as 44.5 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated,” Fitch Solutions said quoting Our World In Data. “Therefore, given the slow vaccination and recent sharp rise in Covid-19 cases, generic versions of Molnupiravir could significantly reduce risk of hospitalization admission or deaths.” Generic Molnupiravir will increase access in India and other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), while simplifying current supply chain obstacles, it said.A full five-day treatment course with Molnupiravir in the US costs around USD 712 (Rs 52,909). Generic versions of the drug will cost between USD 18.79 (about Rs 1,400) to USD 21.48 (about Rs 1,600) for a five-day course, which is significantly lower, according to Fitch Solutions.For instance, Dr. Reddy has set the price of its molnupiravir generic version, molflu, at USD 0.4693 (Rs 35) per capsule and USD 18.79 (Rs 1,400) for a five-day course of 40 capsules.“With this relatively low cost, we expect molnupiravir generic versions to significantly increase access in India and other LMICs after regulatory approvals,” it said.Moreover, these oral antiviral drugs will lead to lower costs of transport and distribution compared with Covid-19 intravenous antivirals such as Ronapreve (Casirivimab/Imdevimab) or Veklury (Remdesivir).Having a solid, compact form, oral drugs does not need containment requirement of glass vials and the tablets can be tightly packed without risk of breakage. Similarly, a larger quantity of the drug can be contained within a set space, increasing the rate at which the drug can be distributed, it added.

We pledge to not sell or give our lands on lease to Muslims. We Hindus pledge to buy from vendors coming to our villages only after ascertaining their religion. We also pledge to not work as labourers for them.” Surguja Collector Sanjeev Jha told PTI on Friday that after the video surfaced, the district's Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) and Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) visited the village on Thursday and gathered details about the incident.Further action is being taken into the matter, he added.On January 1, residents from Aara village, which falls in neighbouring Balrampur district, visited Kundikala to celebrate the New Year during which they entered into a brawl with some locals, Surguja ASP Vivek Shukla said.The next day, a resident of Kundikala, lodged a complaint alleging half-a-dozen villagers of Aara (belonging to a particular community) along with some others  barged into his house and thrashed him and two family members, including his niece, he said.Based on the complaint, 6 persons were arrested, but all of them got bail from a local court the same day, Shukla said.Prima facie it seems, taking advantage of that incident, some people provoked residents of Kundikala to hold a gathering and take such a pledge against the minority community, he said.“We are trying to identify those who administered the oath to the gathering,"   Shukla added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chhattisgarh-video-shows-villagers-taking-oath-to-boycott-muslims-probe-on-359075

It will be virtual from March 5-9, and in person from March 10-14.“Keeping in mind the advent of the new variant and the sharp rise in the number of cases across the country, we have thought it best to reschedule the Festival and hold it in March 2022. We remain committed to bring the Festival back to Jaipur as an on-ground, immersive experience, promoting dialogue, discussion and debate on books and ideas,” festival producer Sanjoy K Roy said in a statement.India recorded 1,17,100 new cases of Covid-19 on Friday as the virus continues to spread at a blistering pace, largely driven by the virulent Omicron variant.The festival this year will also witness a shift from its traditional venue Diggi Palace to Hotel Clarks Amber, Jaipur with added facilities to accommodate footfalls and follow COVID-19 safety protocols according to government guidelines.Turkish bestselling novelist Elif Shafak, Hollywood actor-writer Rupert Everett, award-winning Srilankan writer Shehan Karunatilaka, eminent Jamaican poet Kei Miller, Booker Prize winner Damon Galgut, 2003 Booker Prize winner DBC Pierre British and historian-biographer Andrew Lownie are among those participating in the event.

07-01-2022||New Delhi||Class 12 exams: SC strikes down condition in CBSE policy to consider marks scored in later test||The Supreme Court on Friday struck down a condition specified in a clause in the CBSE’s evaluation policy of June last year which stated that marks obtained in the later examination will be considered as final for assessing class 12 students.A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar said the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) shall provide an option to the candidate to accept the better of the two marks obtained in the subject for final declaration of his or her results for the last academic year.The apex court, which was hearing a plea filed by some students who had appeared in the CBSE exams last year for improving their marks in class 12, noted that a grievance has been made about the provision in clause 28 of the June 17, 2021 policy which stated that “….as per this policy, marks scored in later examination will be considered final”.“As a result, we have no hesitation in striking down the condition specified in clause 28 that as per the policy, marks scored in later examination will be considered final,” the bench said.The top court noted that the petitioners have the grievance that this condition has been inserted in departure of the earlier schemes where the better of the two marks obtained by a candidate in a subject was to be considered for final declaration of results.It observed that the CBSE has not given any justification for such a departure.Last year, the CBSE class 12 board examination was cancelled due to the pandemic.The bench, which disposed of the plea, said the policy was required to be adopted because of the challenging situation faced by the students and this itself justifies making a provision which is more favourable to the students.At the outset, the counsel appearing for the CBSE said these students have been assessed as per the improvement examination, and now they cannot take advantage of the policy.“How does it affect you? Give us the justification, why this is not possible,” the bench observed.While hearing the matter last month, the apex court had said the CBSE should consider the problem of those students who had appeared in the examinations last year for improving marks in class 12 but obtained less marks, as it will affect the admissions secured by them for higher studies.The students, who appeared in the improvement exams, have taken admissions based on their original results and that should not be disturbed, the apex court had observed.The top court was hearing a plea filed by 11 students who were declared passed in the original results by the CBSE on the basis of the evaluation policy of 30:30:40 and were subsequently allowed to appear in the improvement exams held in August-September last year.The plea, filed by advocate Ravi Prakash, had sought a direction to authorities concerned to maintain the original result of the petitioners instead of the improvement examination result.As per a press statement of CBSE, 34,317 regular students had appeared in the offline examinations for the purpose of improvement of their marks, it said.On June 17 last year, the top court had approved the assessment schemes of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) and the CBSE, which had adopted the 30:30:40 formula for evaluation of marks for students of 12th standard based on results of class 10, 11 and 12 respectively.The CBSE had earlier said it would evaluate class 12 students for theory based on 30 per cent marks from class 10 board, 30 per cent from class 11, and 40 per cent from marks based on the performance in the unit, mid-term, and pre-board tests in class 12.It had said that marks obtained by class 12 students in practical and internal assessment on an actual basis as uploaded by schools on the CBSE portal would be also considered in deciding the final results.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/class-12-exams-sc-strikes-down-condition-in-cbse-policy-to-consider-marks-scored-in-later-test-359064

Such reports are highly ill-informed, misleading and far from the truth,” the ministry said. The Union Health Secretary, in his meeting with the ECI on Thursday, presented the overall global and domestic status of spread of Covid, as well as Omicron, in the country.Details were also presented on status of preparedness of the public health response within the states for control and management of the increasing numbers of Covid cases, the statement said.The focus of the presentation was on poll bound states and their neighbouring states, it added.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/election-commission-informed-on-covid-situation-in-country-union-health-ministry-359045

07-01-2022||London||Milder omicron an 'evolutionary mistake'; next variant could be more virulent: warns Indian-origin UK expert||The reduced severity of Omicron is good news for now, but it is the result of an "evolutionary mistake" as COVID-19 is transmitting very efficiently and there is no reason for it to become milder, indicating that the next variant could be more virulent, a leading Indian-origin scientist from the University of Cambridge has warned.Ravindra Gupta, Professor of Clinical Microbiology at the Cambridge Institute for Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Diseases (CITIID), led a recent study on the Omicron variant and was among the first globally to describe the modified fusion mechanism of cells at play which might make Omicron more visible to the body's immune defences.While the study showed that the new variant, dominant in the UK and now sweeping parts of India, is infecting the cells found in the lungs less, the virus itself is not intending to become milder."There is this assumption that viruses become more benign over time but that's not what's happening here because those are long-term evolutionary trends," Prof. Gupta told PTI in an interview on Thursday."SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) does not have that issue because it is transmitting very efficiently so it doesn't have any reason to become milder, especially in the era of vaccination with plenty of susceptible hosts. So that's why I think it's an evolutionary mistake. It's not something intentional that the virus is trying to do to change its biology," he explained."This finding of reduced severity with Omicron is obviously good news for now but the next variant that comes, and there will be one, will not necessarily have these characteristics and could go back to the severity that we've seen before."And, in fact I think it probably will… Therefore, blocking infection is a potentially desirable thing to do rather than what I've heard, which is people seeing this as a natural vaccine. That is an understandable but dangerous thing to do because we don't understand the complete implications of different variants on our health,” he said.According to the UK-born scientist with familial roots in Uttar Pradesh, who advises the UK government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) and New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), keeping up the vaccination drive is important because that remains "our first line of defence" against the virus."Whilst we have a situation of a milder variant, we should use that as a chance to increase vaccination coverage," he said.Asked how he sees the Omicron wave impacting India, Prof. Gupta said it was important to learn from other countries' experiences and take pre-emptive action. Also, the types of vaccines used, with fewer RNA vaccines compared to the US and Europe, and genetic differences could play a role in India's experience of the Omicron wave.Gupta said: "In India, there were a lot of Delta infections so there's some immunity there. The vaccines have been rolled out very nicely. We know that Omicron is able to escape from vaccines and third dose boosting is essential."It's not clear in India, where mainly people have had two doses plus an infection, whether this will be adequate. There will be certain people who are vulnerable who get sick and do need ventilation, specially the unvaccinated."That's why caution is needed and focus on infection transmission interruption and vaccination are so important." According to Gupta's study into Omicron, there seems to be a difference between its impact on the deep tissues in the lung and the upper airways or bronchus. This is down to the presence of a particular protein or enzyme which is sitting on the surface of the cells in the lung called TMPRSS2, which prevents the virus from completing an efficient infection."So, two pathways are available to the virus and Omicron prefers one pathway rather than the other and because of that choice, that pathway is more dominant in the upper airways where implications for oxygenation and lung function are milder compared to if things are going on deep into your lungs," he explains.As the Omicron variant does not engage the TMPRSS2 very efficiently, its ability to cause large fused cells is impaired. This fusion mechanism of making larger cells is a way that the virus can help itself avoid neutralising antibodies and by not being able to fuse, Omicron might make itself more visible to the immune system.“It's a bit unclear. But it's very real and it's very related to what we call a tropism (behavioural) switch. The big question is why the virus is unable to use TMPRSS2. We are still trying to understand this… for some reason, Omicron's spike is less well processed or cleaved,” said Gupta.The virus needs to be cleaved, or cut in two, in order for it to perform its functions optimally and Omicron seems to have lost some aspect of its function."But if it's replicating in the upper airways, passing very efficiently, it fulfills the goal of transmission much more effectively than if it were infecting deep tissues, which is probably an evolutionary mistake for the virus,” added Gupta.As a result, his team's focus now is on further studying why this evolutionary mistake occurred and to understand the biology of the virus better to help with more effective and efficient future courses of drugs and vaccines. According to the COVID-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update, released by the global health agency on Thursday, a record 9.5 million new COVID-19 cases were reported around the world during the week December 27-January 2.The update said that during the week December 27, 2021 to January 2, 2022, following a gradual increase since October, the global number of new cases increased sharply by 71 per cent as compared to the previous week.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned that while the Omicron variant appears to be less severe compared to Delta, especially in those vaccinated, it does not mean it should be categorised as ‘mild'.Just like previous variants; Omicron is hospitalising people and it is killing people, he said in Geneva at a press briefing."In fact, the tsunami of cases is so huge and quick, that it is overwhelming health systems around the world," Tedros said.Hospitals are becoming overcrowded and understaffed, which further results in preventable deaths from not only COVID-19 but other diseases and injuries where patients cannot receive timely care, he said.Since the Coronavirus was first reported in central China's Wuhan city, the deadly disease has infected over 300,173,00 people globally and caused more than 5,472,000 deaths.

07-01-2022||New Delhi||Settle border row, stop renaming places, China told||India today pulled up China for “renaming” places in Arunachal Pradesh and writing “inappropriate” letters to Indian MPs. “We hope that instead of engaging in such antics, China will work constructively with us to resolve the outstanding friction points in areas along the western sector of the LAC,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.Noting media reports of the Chinese side naming some places in Arunachal Pradesh last week, Bagchi said India had immediately conveyed its views on “such a ridiculous exercise to support untenable territorial claims”.Calling Tuting as “DouDeng” or Siyom river as “XiYueMu” or even Kibithu as “Daba” does not alter the fact that Arunachal Pradesh has always been and will always be an inalienable part of India, he added. Commenting on the reports about a bridge being built by the Chinese on Pangong lake, Bagchi said the activity was being closely watched. “The construction is being undertaken in areas that have been under illegal occupation by China for around 60 years now. You are well aware India has never accepted such illegal occupation,” he said.Separately, the government has been taking all necessary steps to ensure that India’s security interests are fully protected. As part of these efforts, the government has also, over the past seven years, increased significantly the budget for development of border infrastructure and completed more roads and bridges than ever before. These have provided much needed connectivity to the local population as well as logistical support to armed forces. “The government remains committed to this objective,” he said.The MEA also took umbrage to political counsellor at the Chinese Embassy writing letters to Indian MPs saying substance, tone and tenor of the letters are inappropriate. “The Chinese side should note that India is a vibrant democracy and MPs, as representatives of the people, undertake activities as per their views and beliefs. We expect the Chinese side to refrain from hyping normal activities by MPs and further complicate the situation in our bilateral relations,” he said.Commenting on media reports about PLA unfurling a flag at Galwan Valley, he said that was not factually correct. Media houses in India had released pictures contradicting the claim, he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/settle-border-row-stop-renaming-places-china-told-358883

07-01-2022||---||Of former PMs & security breaches||New Delhi, January 6Past breaches have triggered major reviews of Prime Ministers’ security, with the most comprehensive overhaul happening on June 2, 1988, when Parliament passed the Special Protection Group Act to protect the PMs after Indira Gandhi’s assassination by her bodyguards on October 31, 1984.Looking backFebruary 8, 1967: Then PM Indira Gandhi was attacked with a brick during an election rally in Bhubaneswar, but she continued her speech from the dais and proceeded to conclude her tour to Kolkata.October 2, 1986: Then PM Rajiv Gandhi continued his Rajghat visit on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti despite three shots being fired at him; he went about his day even as the attack exposed serious security lapses.Every Prime Minister reacted differently to the threats they faced, with the issue triggering a heated debate across social media and political circles today in the wake of PM Narendra Modi’s security breach during his Punjab visit yesterday.Moments after PM Modi cancelled his Ferozepur rally on Wednesday after protesting farmers blocked his cavalcade’s route, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala reminded the ruling BJP of the “resoluteness and firmness” with which late PMs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi had faced dangers in their times.The first reference was to how Indira Gandhi, despite being attacked with a brick during an election rally in Bhubaneswar on February 8, 1967, continued her speech from the dais and proceeded to conclude her tour to Kolkata before returning to Delhi and getting her nose operated upon.The second reference was to late PM Rajiv Gandhi who continued his Rajghat visit on the occasion of Gandhi Jayanti, October 2, 1986, despite three shots being fired at him.Earlier in 1937, when Jawaharlal Nehru was campaigning in view of the provincial elections in British India, a group of dacoits had blocked his way in Chambal.The dacoits quickly lost their steam when the senior Congress leader stepped out of his vehicle and offered to talk.In the aftermath of the Operation Bluestar, then PM Indira Gandhi had refused to remove Sikh bodyguards from her inner security ring despite the warning by security agencies.Then Director in the PMO Wajahat Habibullah told The Tribune today, “The security agencies at the time should have never consulted PM Indira Gandhi. Her security was their responsibility and they should have acted on their own in view of the threat perception. Even today, the principal responsibility for the lapse in the PM’s security in Punjab rests on the central security agencies. The role of the state police comes later.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/of-former-pms-security-breaches-358895

07-01-2022||New Delhi/Chandigarh||'Security breach': PM briefs President; Minister says MHA will take 'tough decisions'||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday briefed President Ram Nath Kovind on the "security breach" that stalled his Punjab visit and the government indicated that some “big and tough decisions” will be taken after the Union Home Ministry gathers information.Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi claimed that what happened in Ferozepur wasn’t a security threat but a “gimmick” aimed at imposing President’s Rule on the state.The Supreme Court also took note of the matter and the Punjab government announced a two-member committee to probe the episode, as the BJP and the Congress continued to spar over it.BJP leaders offered prayers at temples in different parts of the country for a long life for the PM. They also posted their wishes and prayers for Modi on Twitter, using the hashtag “LongLivePMModi”.From Defence Minister Rajnath Singh to Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, political leaders weighed in on the controversy, largely following their party line.Punjab BJP leader met Governor Banwarilal Purohit in Chandigarh, seeking the dismissal of the state’s home minister and its police chief.In what the Centre described as a “major security lapse”, Modi’s convoy was stranded Wednesday on a flyover due to a blockade by farm protesters in Ferozepur.He returned from poll-bound Punjab without attending any event, including a rally, and the Centre blamed the Congress government in Punjab for the breach. CM Channi, however, claimed that a last-minute change of travel plans by Modi led to the situation.On Thursday, his government constituted a two-member committee to conduct a “thorough probe” into the incident.The panel of retired Justice Mehtab Singh Gill and Principal Secretary, Home Affairs and Justice, Anurag Verma will submit its report on the “lapses” in three days.In Delhi, Union minister Anurag Thakur indicated that the Home Ministry will act on the security breach.“The home ministry has also spoken about taking action. After gathering information, whatever steps... big and tough decisions will be taken by it,” he told reporters during a briefing on a cabinet meeting.“It is my firm belief that the country’s judicial system does justice to everyone and when such mistakes happen, whatever steps need to be taken will be taken,” the minister added.Modi also met President Ram Nath Kovind, who expressed concern over the security lapse.“President Ram Nath Kovind met Prime Minister Modi at the Rashtrapati Bhavan today and received from him a first-hand account of the security breach in his convoy in Punjab yesterday,” the President’s secretariat said on Twitter.“The President expressed his concerns about the serious lapse,” it added.Earlier, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu spoke to the PM and expressed his deep concern over the incident.The Supreme Court will on Friday hear a plea seeking a thorough investigation into the security breach. A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana took note of senior advocate Maninder Singh’s submission on the issue.“Serve the copy (of the petition) to the state government. We will take it tomorrow as the first item,” the bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, said.Hours after his government announced a probe into the “lapses” in Ferozepur, CM Channi took an aggressive stand at a public meeting in Hoshiarpur’s Tanda.He maintained that the security threat claim was “cheap theatrics” that did not behove a leader of the PM’s stature.The CM claimed that Modi cancelled his trip because of the “thin” crowd at the rally venue, and there was a “conspiracy” to defame the state.“Yesterday’s gimmick by the PM and his coterie is aimed at imposing President Rule in the state,” he said.In Uttarkashi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said if the safety of the prime minister cannot be ensured, it would be difficult to prevent the “disintegration of the country’s democratic institutions.”           The Punjab BJP said it did not have any expectations from the probe committee set up by the state government.“The chief minister is the conspirator of this conspiracy. What will this committee set up by his government do?” Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma told reporters after meeting the Governor.The BJP delegation demanded the dismissal of the state home minister—Deputy Chief Minister Sukjinder Singh Randhawa holds the portfolio – and DGP S Chattopadhyay over the lapse.
