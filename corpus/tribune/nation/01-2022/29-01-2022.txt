He was also conferred with Shiromani Pant Rattan award.Baba Iqbal Singh worked relentlessly towards imparting value-based education in rural India.In charge of Kalgidhar Trust since 1965, before he had retired in 1987, he built the organisation brick by brick that now runs 129 CBSE-affiliated English medium schools which have more than 70,000 children, most of them are from five rural North Indian states. Far away from the urban milieu, these schools focus on value-based education to children from marginalised sections of society.शिक्षा, चिकित्सा और समाजसेवा के क्षेत्र में उल्लेखनीय योगदान करने वाले श्री इक़बाल सिंह जी के निधन से बहुत दुःख हुआ। उनकी सेवाओं के सम्मान स्वरूप, उन्हें वर्ष 2022 में पद्मश्री के लिए चुना गया। उनके परिवार व प्रशंसकों के प्रति मेरी गहन शोक-संवेदनाएं।  With only five students in a one-room school called ‘Akal Academy' at Baru Sahib, Sirmaur, Baba Iqbal Singh used his pension to construct the building and managed the school for the first year. Earlier, it was a forest area. The following year, more than 70 children from nearby districts took admission. Many families also came forward to help the trust later, said staff of the trust.Pained by the passing away of Baba Iqbal Singh Ji. He will be remembered for his efforts to increase education among youngsters. He tirelessly worked towards furthering social empowerment. My thoughts are with his family and admirers in this sad hour. May Waheguru bless his soul.  However, soon it was realised that establishing one school could not solve problems faced by children in nearby districts. The trust thus opened Akal Academy in Muktsar in 1993. By 1999, it had opened 19 academies across Punjab and the count now goes up to 129 schools spread across Punjab, UP, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana. Many students have nationally topped the IIT, IIM and NEET exams.Deeply saddened to know about the demise of Shiromani Panth Rattan Baba Iqbal Singh Ji. The spiritual leader was recently honored with Padma Shri for his exemplary social work. May Guru Sahib grant peace to the departed soul. My condolences & concerns for his family & followers. pic.twitter.com/luVFxYLEzJ  As a social worker, Baba Iqbal Singh didn’t restrict himself just to the education sector, he was involved in every facet of community life ie. schools, hospital, colleges, women care centre and de-addiction centres. With his team, he set up Akal Charitable Hospital at Baru Sahib, Sirmaur, which provides medical care to rural poor and other deprived sections of society. Every year, medical camps are organised in which doctors from Mumbai, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab provide free medical care including free surgeries to poor people.Deeply saddened by the demise of social worker & philanthropist Shiromani Panth Rattan, Sardar Baba Iqbal Singh Ji.

29-01-2022||---||All outstanding issues, including Kashmir, should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy: Pakistan PM Khan ahead of China visit||Beijing/Islamabad, January 29Ahead of his visit to China, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has said that for “enduring peace” in South Asia, it is contingent that a “strategic balance” in the region is maintained and all “outstanding issues” like border questions and the Kashmir issue should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy and according to norms of international law.In an article published in China’s state-run Global Times, Khan briefly referred to the resolution of the Kashmir issue besides the border disputes as key to maintaining peace in South Asia.“It is our common vision that enduring peace in South Asia is contingent on maintaining a strategic balance in the region and all outstanding issues like border questions and the Kashmir dispute should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy and as per norms of international law,” he wrote, amidst a chill in bilateral ties between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue and cross-border terrorism.Prime Minister Khan also gave a clean chit to China over human rights allegations against Uygur Muslims in Xinjiang ahead of his visit to China to take part in the February 4 Beijing Winter Olympics’ inaugural ceremony, that faced a diplomatic boycott by the US and allies over the Xinjiang issue, saying his country’s envoy after a visit to the province reported that charges were not true.“There is a lot of criticism of the treatment of Uygurs by China in the West. But our Ambassador went there (and) he sent information that it is not actually true on the ground,” Khan told Chinese journalists in an interview in Islamabad on Saturday ahead of his visit to Beijing.While giving the clean chit to China over the restive region of Xinjiang, Khan, however, blamed the “selective silence” of the Western countries on alleged human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir.India has repeatedly told Pakistan that Jammu and Kashmir “was, is and shall forever” remain an integral part of the country. It also advised Pakistan to accept the reality and stop all anti-India propaganda.India has emphasised that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility.During a previous interview with Chinese journalists in July 2021, Khan deflected criticism of Pakistan’s silence on allegations of rights abuses by China against Uygur Muslims.Khan, according to Pakistan daily Dawn, said that Pakistan had accepted Beijing’s version regarding the treatment of Uyghurs due to “our extreme proximity and relationship”.Besides taking part in the inaugural ceremony, Khan will be holding the key meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other officials to discuss the state of the all-weather ties, the problems faced by the USD 60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and Chinese loans and investments to shore up Pakistan’s sagging economy.The USD 60 billion CPEC, which connects Gwadar Port in Pakistan’s Balochistan with China’s Xinjiang province, is the flagship project of China’s ambitious multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).India has protested to China over the CPEC as it is being laid through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.China currently has launched a diplomatic offensive to mobilise world leaders to attend the February 4 opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics as the US, European Union, and several western countries announced a boycott of the event by their diplomats to highlight their allegations of human rights violations in Xinjiang, including incarceration of over a million Uygur Muslim men and women in camps.As per the list released by China, 32 world leaders, including Khan, Russian President Vladimir Putin besides UN Secretary-General António Guterres will attend the ceremony.In his article, Khan said the security of the scores of Chinese personnel working in CPEC projects is Pakistan’s top priority.Pakistan has approved an unprecedented USD 11.6 million in compensation for the families of Chinese engineers who were killed and wounded in a terrorist attack last year at the Dasu Dam hydropower project, The Express Tribune reported recently.“Safety and security of Chinese personnel and projects in Pakistan remains our top priority. Our people and state institutions are determined to safeguard CPEC from the detractors of Pakistan-China friendship and bring to justice those responsible for harming our interests”, Khan said in his article.Khan recently directed authorities to “remove all bottlenecks for investors” in an attempt to address the Chinese investors’ concerns of slow pace of CPEC projects.Khan in his article also said that CPEC has been instrumental in addressing Pakistan’s chronic energy crisis and improving connectivity through infrastructure development.“We are also making rapid progress on the development of Gwadar Port and Special Economic Zones which would benefit the entire region”, he said.“As the flagship project of the BRI, CPEC has immense economic and strategic significance for our two countries. There is complete consensus in Pakistan on CPEC’s indispensability for Pakistan’s national development. My government is fully committed to making CPEC a High-Quality Demonstration Project of BRI”, he said.Khan in his interview with the Chinese journalists hailed and stressed the “deep relationship” between the two countries, saying it had only strengthened over time.“There is a feeling in Pakistan that China always stood with us in times of need and supported us during difficult times. Similarly, Pakistan also always stood with China,” he said.Asked about Afghanistan, Khan said that foreign forces cannot just leave the country without thinking of its people, and warned the country could see the “worst humanitarian crisis” if everyone abandoned it.“The international community should just think of the 40 million Afghans. Whether they like the Taliban government or not should be secondary,” he said.                                     #ImranKhan                                     #kashmir||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-outstanding-issues-including-kashmir-should-be-resolved-through-dialogue-and-diplomacy-pakistan-pm-khan-ahead-of-china-visit-365332
29-01-2022||Rajkot||Two groups clash over social media posts in Rajkot||Instagram ‘stories’ and a discussion on it on a Whatsapp group led to a clash between people from two religious communities in Gujarat’s Rajkot city, after which a case was registered, a police official said on Saturday.A Bhaktinagar police station official said members of the two communities met to resolve the issue at a pre-decided spot on Thursday night, but things got out of hand and the motorcycle of one person was damaged, he said.“Individuals from two religious communities posted Instagram stories, which are auto-deleted after 24 hours, and claimed their sentiments were hurt. They asked each other to remove the posts and agreed to meet at a spot to discuss the matter. Nearly half a dozen people from both sides arrived on Thursday night,” Zone I Deputy Commissioner of Police Praveen Meena said.“They were forced to disperse by a police patrol van as night curfew is in place for the coronavirus outbreak. While dispersing, one of them damaged the motorcycle of a person from the other group,” he added.An FIR was lodged against the group under sections 506 (criminal intimidation), 427 (mischief causing damage to property), and 114 (abettor present when crime committed) of the Indian Penal Code, police said.                                      #socialmedia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-groups-clash-over-social-media-posts-in-rajkot-365331
29-01-2022||New Delhi||Best time to take forward India-Israel relations to next level: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said there cannot be a better time to set new goals for taking forward India-Israel relations and asserted that the cooperation between the two countries has played a key role in the growth stories of the two nations.In a special video message on the completion of 30 years of full-fledged diplomatic relations between India and Israel, Modi said this period has been very important for both countries.He also said the people of India and Israel have always shared a special relationship.Though India had recognised Israel on September 17, 1950, full-fledged diplomatic relations between the countries were established on January 29, 1992. Since then, the bilateral relations between both countries have developed into a multifaceted strategic partnership.Earlier this week, Israel’s envoy to India Naor Gilon had said the 30th anniversary of India-Israel diplomatic ties is a good opportunity to look ahead and shape the next 30 years of relations.He exuded confidence that the close cooperation between the two countries in different fields will only grow further in the coming years.India’s Ambassador to Israel Sanjeev Singla said, “We are proud to mark the 30th anniversary of our bilateral relations and look forward to using the special logo throughout the year to celebrate this special milestone.”Emphasising that “friendship and trust” are not only positive traits but also “real assets”, the foreign ministers of India and Israel in a joint op-ed for an Israeli daily on Friday had said the two countries have worked together to “deepen their roots” for the last three decades, delving together to find solutions to common challenges, including in the security sector.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Israeli counterpart Yair Lapid contributed a joint piece, “Deepening Roots” for Israel Hayom to mark 30 years of establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.Incidentally, a New York Times report claiming that India bought Pegasus spyware as part of a USD 2 billion defence deal with Israel in 2017 triggered a major controversy on Saturday with the Opposition alleging that the government indulged in illegal snooping that amounted to “treason”.Congress and some other opposition parties indicated that they would raise the issue strongly in the Budget Session of Parliament starting Monday, even as Union minister Gen (retd) V K Singh called The New York Times “Supari Media”.A government source, however, said the matter related to the Pegasus software was being monitored by a committee under the Supreme Court—headed by retired Supreme Court judge R V Raveendran—and its report was awaited.At the same time, India’s former permanent representative to the UN Syed Akbaruddin dismissed as “utter rubbish” the “insinuation” in the NYT report which cited India’s 2019 vote in support of Israel at the UN’s Economic and Social Council to highlight deepening of ties after a deal that included the sale of Pegasus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/best-time-to-take-forward-india-israel-relations-to-next-level-pm-modi-365330

29-01-2022||---||ISRO espionage: SC to hear on February 25 CBI plea against anticipatory bail to four||New Delhi, January 29The Supreme Court would hear on February 25 the appeal of CBI challenging the anticipatory bail granted to four persons, including a former Director-General of Police (DGP), who are accused of framing scientist Nambi Narayanan in the 1994 ISRO espionage case.The probe agency sought adjournment of the hearing and four weeks’ time for filing rejoinder to the replies filed by the accused police officers to its appeal challenging the grant of anticipatory bail, saying that some of its officials dealing with the case were down with COVID-19.The hearing on the CBI’s special leave petition (SLP) against the Kerala High Court order granting pre-arrest bail to senior police and intelligence officers was listed for hearing on Friday before a bench comprising justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar.The bench has now listed the case for hearing on February 25.Earlier in November last year, the top court had agreed to hear the CBI’s appeal and had issued notices to R B Sreekumar (former DGP of Gujarat), Vijayan, Thampi S Durga Dutt, and P S Jayaprakash.The high court had on August 13, last year granted anticipatory bail to the four accused.The CBI said that it has found that some scientists were tortured and framed in the matter due to which the development of the cryogenic engine was hit and this led to India’ space programme going back by almost one or two decades.The investigating agency had earlier alleged that there was a clear indication that the accused were part of a team, which had ulterior motives to torpedo the attempts of the ISRO for manufacturing the cryogenic engine.While granting anticipatory bail to these persons, the high court had said, “There is not even a scintilla of evidence regarding the petitioners being influenced by any foreign power so as to induce them to hatch a conspiracy to falsely implicate the scientists of the ISRO with the intention to stall the activities of the ISRO with regard to the development of the cryogenic engine.”    It had said unless there are specific materials regarding their involvement, prima facie, it cannot be said that they were acting against the interests of the country.The CBI has registered a case against 18 persons for various alleged offences, including criminal conspiracy, in connection with the arrest and detention of former ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan in the espionage case.The case, which had hit the headlines in 1994, pertained to allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India’s space programme to foreign countries by two scientists and four others, including two Maldivian women.Narayanan, who was given a clean chit by the CBI, had earlier said that the Kerala police had “fabricated” the case and the technology he was accused to have stolen and sold in the 1994 case did not even exist at that time.The CBI, in its probe, had said that the then top police officials in Kerala were responsible for Narayanan’s illegal arrest.The apex court had on September 14, 2018, appointed a three-member committee, while directing the Kerala government to cough up Rs 50 lakh compensation for compelling Narayanan to undergo “immense humiliation”.Terming the police action against the ex-scientist of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) as a “psycho-pathological treatment”, the apex court had in September 2018 said that his “liberty and dignity”, basic to his human rights, were jeopardised as he was taken into custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, was compelled to face “cynical abhorrence”.                                       #espionage                                     #ISRO||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isro-espionage-sc-to-hear-on-february-25-cbi-plea-against-anticipatory-bail-to-four-365325

The hymn was dropped by the government on the grounds that playing more Indian tunes would be appropriate in view of the ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’, a move that has been criticised by Opposition parties.All said, the sky dazzled with drones, fabricated through indigenous technology, as the show lasted for around 10 minutes along with synchronised background music.A projection mapping show to commemorate 75 years of independence on the walls of North Block and South Block, added colours to the ambience.Foot-tapping music by the bands of Indian Army, Navy, Air Force and Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) filled the air. They also stood in various formations.The entry band played the ‘Veer Sainik’ tune, followed by Pipes & Drums Band, CAPF Band, Air Force Band, Naval Band, Army Military Band and Massed Bands.Commander Vijay Charles D’Cruz was the principal conductor of the ceremony.To celebrate the ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’, new tunes were added to the ceremony. These included ‘Kerala’, ‘Hind ki Sena’ and ‘Ae Mere Watan Ke Logon’.President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Army chief Manoj Mukund Naravane, Navy chief Admiral R Hari Kumar and Air Force chief Air Marshal V R Chaudhari and various other dignitaries were present at the ceremony.The drone show was organised by the startup ‘Botlab Dynamics’ and supported by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi and the Department of Science & Technology.A centuries-old military tradition, Beating the Retreat dates back to the days when troops disengaged from a battle at sunset. As soon as the buglers sounded the retreat, the troops ceased fighting, sheathed their arms and withdrew from the battlefield.The custom of standing still during the sounding of retreat has been retained to this day. Colours and standards are cased and flags lowered at retreats.And drumbeats recall the days when troops, billeted in towns and cities, were recalled to their quarters at an appointed time in the evening.Those present to witness the ceremony carried eco-friendly invitation cards.The cards had been prepared with the seeds of medicinal plants of Ashwagandha, Aloe Vera and Amla embedded in it. People are being encouraged to plant those in their gardens/flower pots and reap the age-old medicinal benefits, according to the defence ministry.With a note of serenity, ‘Sare Jahan se Acha’ song concluded the event and the gathering slowly dispersed.The Beating the Retreat ceremony marked the end of Republic Day celebrations that started this year a day early with Parakram Divas on January 23 to mark birth anniversary of Subash Chandra Bose.                                     #Republicday||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dazzling-drones-projection-mapping-show-add-colour-to-beating-the-retreat-365321

Subsequently, India voted in favour of Israel by denying observer status at the UN’s Economic and Social Council to a Palestinian human rights organisation. “Access helped Israel win votes in the UN and to reach an accord with Arab adversaries,” reported the paper.However, when asked to respond to this claim by analyst Dilip Cherian, Akbaruddin said, “The insinuation about India’s UN vote is utter rubbish.”                                     #Pegasus||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/utter-rubbish-says-former-indian-envoy-to-un-on-us-media-reports-on-pegasus-365312

29-01-2022||New Delhi||Supreme Court committee monitoring Pegasus matter; report awaited: Govt source||A government source on Saturday said the matter related to Pegasus software is being monitored by a committee under the Supreme Court and its report is awaited.The source said the inquiry committee—set up under the supervision of retired Supreme Court judge R V Raveendran—has also published a newspaper advertisement on January 2 calling for submission of phones by people who claim their devices were infected by Pegasus.“Matter (is) already with the Supreme Court. The court has constituted a committee under the supervision of retired judge Raveendran. The committee’s report (is) awaited,” the source said.According to a report in The New York Times, the Israeli spyware Pegasus and a missile system were the “centerpieces” of a roughly USD 2-billion deal of sophisticated weapons and intelligence gear between India and Israel in 2017.Opposition party Congress launched an all-out attack on the government following the New York Times report, accusing it of deceiving Parliament, duping the Supreme Court, hijacking democracy and indulging in treason, after a media report claimed India bought the Pegasus spyware from Israel as part of a defence deal in 2017.The Congress said it intends to raise the issue in the budget session starting next week and will demand accountability from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government on the floor of Parliament.The principal opposition party also urged the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance of the matter and initiate appropriate penal proceedings against the government for attempting to deliberately and knowingly “deceive” it.The shadow of the Pegasus issue looms large again over the 2022 budget session as the entire Monsoon session of 2021 was washed out after the Opposition had jointly stalled the proceedings over the issue.A massive controversy erupted last year when the NSO Group hit the headlines with the alleged use of its Pegasus software by some governments to spy on journalists, human rights defenders, politicians and others in a number of countries, including India, triggered concerns over issues relating to privacy.                                      #Pegasus||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-committee-monitoring-pegasus-matter-report-awaited-govt-source-365309

29-01-2022||Bhopal||Congress demands apology from MP minister for ‘fake father, fake chacha’ Facebook post||The Madhya Pradesh Congress on Saturday demanded an apology from state higher education minister Mohan Yadav for reportedly uploading a Facebook post about “country’s fake father and fake chacha” not being part of the recent Republic Day parade, an apparent reference to Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.MP Congress spokesperson Bhupendra Gupta claimed Yadav’s Facebook post, which has been removed since, said,” Subhash Chandra Bose and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel were there in the parade of the Republic Day.Neither the country’s fake father nor the fake chacha were there... Nor the iron lady, nor the inventor of the computer were there.”“The parade had tableaux of Kashi Vishwanath and Vaishno Devi. It was a scene of Sanatan Culture. My country is truly changing and coming out from the clutches of the slaves of the Britishers, my country is truly turning Independent # Jai_Hind, Vande Mataram, Bharat Mata ki Jai,” Gupta said quoting the now deleted post by Yadav.Gupta said it is not expected from the political heirs of a man who took Rs 60 from the British as pension to respect Independence.“Why will those people who stood witness against the great freedom fighter Bhagat Singh and dissuaded countrymen from joining Subhash Chandra Bose’s army (INA) respect Independence? But we won’t let them prevail. We are not going to sit quietly until RSS ideologue Yadav apologizes,” Gupta said.If Yadav does not apologize, then he must be sacked from the MP cabinet, Gupta added.Hitting back, MP BJP spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi said the Congress was averse to the post as it mainly has praises for Kashi Vishwanath, Vaishno Devi and Sanatan Dharma, which were against the opposition party’s appeasement politics.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-demands-apology-from-mp-minister-for-fake-father-fake-chacha-facebook-post-365298

A majority of the local residents belong to the Patidar community.Initially, the village was not ready to believe that the four persons, including a baby, who died on the US-Canada border belonged to the family of Baldevbhai Patel, they said.  However, they later came to terms with the hard fact that the deceased were his son Jagdish Patel (39), daughter-in-law Vaishali (37), granddaughter Vihangi (11), and grandson Dharmik (3), after Canadian authorities confirmed their identities.Following the confirmation of their identity, relatives and some local women had gathered at the Patel family's ancestral house at Dingucha on Friday to mourn the deaths.As per the Canadian authorities, the Patel family had arrived in Toronto on January 12, 2022. From there, they made their way to Manitoba and eventually to Emerson around January 18, a day before they tragically died near the border due to exposure to extreme weather conditions. The relatives had on Friday said that the bodies of the four deceased would not be brought back to India. "The entire family is in deep shock….As of now, we all have decided not to bring the bodies here for cremation. Last rites will be conducted in Canada itself," Jaswant Patel, a cousin of late Jagdish Patel, had said.Earlier, the Gujarat police had also received reports about the disappearance of two more families from the state, comprising two couples and two children. They had gone untraceable after reaching Turkey on a visitor visa earlier this month. But after an investigation, the police had confirmed that the two couples were safe and staying at a hotel in Turkey. Meanwhile, the state's Crime Investigation Department (CID) has launched a separate probe into the possibility of illegal immigration rackets being run by agents. Earlier this week, the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) of the state CID-Crime was given the task to unearth the network of agents active in Gujarat.                                      #Canada                                     #Gujarat                                     #Indianfamily||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarats-dingucha-village-mourns-family-that-froze-to-death-on-us-canada-border-365297
29-01-2022||Muzaffarnagar||BJP government chased away criminals and mafias who flourished during SP regime in Uttar Pradesh: Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday took a swipe at Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, saying he does not have “shame” while talking “lies” about the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh where the BJP government has chased away criminals and mafias who flourished during the earlier regime.He also scoffed at Yadav and RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary’s display of togetherness and said leaders of these parties will be seen together only till election. He said in the event of government formation, people like Azam Khan and Atiq Ahmad will take centre stage and Chaudhary will not be seen anywhere.Seeking support for the saffron party in western Uttar Pradesh, Shah invoked eminent Jat leader late Prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh and farmers’ leader Mahendra Singh Tikait, and asked if anyone can forget the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots during which “victims were made accused”.The home minister also reeled out comparative crime figures under the present Yogi Adityanath-led state government and the one headed by Yadav before him, and dared the Samajwadi Party (SP) chief to come out with the statistics of his governance.Addressing the ‘matdaataas’ (voters) here, Shah referred to the Muzaffarnagar riots during the Samajwadi Party rule.Alleging that police acted with vote bank in mind during the riots, he said, “The victims were made accused and accused the victims, and thousands of fake cases were lodged. I congratulate the BJP which acted under party leader Sanjeev Baliyan and fought the ‘nyay ki ladai’ (fight for justice) either in courts or on the roads.” “I want to ask the people of Muzaffarnagar and of western Uttar Pradesh if they have forgotten the riots? If the same mistake is done, then those who instigated the riots will sit on the seat of power in Lucknow, but if ‘lotus’ (BJP party symbol) is elected, there will be no riots,” he said, giving the target of winning over 300 seats in the northern state.Muzaffarnagar had witnessed communal violence in 2013, killing over 60 people and displacing 40,000.Uttar Pradesh will go to polls in seven phases beginning February 10.On the SP-RLD alliance for the assembly polls, Shah said, “Akhilesh ji yesterday remarked that he and Jayant Chaudhary were ‘saath-saath’ (together), but till when? If the government is formed, Jayant bhai will go and Azam Khan will sit (in his place)…. Jayant will not be seen with him (Akhilesh). Atiq Ahmed will also come. Why do you want to befool the people of the state? The distribution of tickets shows what is going to happen in the future.” Referring to the situation during the previous SP government, he said everyone in the state was concerned about security and the manner in which mafia flourished during SP, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) governments and those doing politics in the name of caste and religion, but today no one is worried about security after the Adityanath government came to power.“All ‘goondas’ (hooligans) have run away from the boundary of Uttar Pradesh. As per our promise, the Yogi Adityanath government has chased away goondas and mafias.“When Behenji’s party (BSP) came to power, it talked of one caste, the Congress talked of one family and Akhilesh ji of goondas, mafias and appeasement, but the BJP talked of security and development,” he said.Taking a dig at Akhilesh Yadav for attacking the Uttar Pradesh government on law and order, the Union minister said, “He does not have shame and speaks lies in such a manner that it could be taken as truth. I have brought the statistics and if you (Yadav) have the courage, hold a press conference with figures of your earlier government.” He also highlighted that figures of kidnapping, murder and extortion have come down substantially in comparison with the time of SP rule (2012-17).Terming vote as the biggest power in democracy, Shah exhorted his audience to use it judiciously.“If it (vote) goes to SP and BSP, there will again be ‘mafia raj’ and if it goes to the BJP, it will help Uttar Pradesh become number one state in the country under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership,” he said.Claiming that security of the country was topmost priority for the BJP government, the senior party leader said for 10 years, it was the Sonia (Gandhi) and Manmohan (Singh) government with SP and BSP when terrorists from across Pakistan border came this side and killed our security personnel, but the leadership in Delhi was not affected in the lure of vote bank.“Can the SP, BSP and Congress keep the country and the state safe?” he asked, adding that it is only the BJP under the leadership of Modi that can do it.Shah also targeted the SP chief on the farmers issue. He said there were 42 sugar mills, of which 21 mills were closed by the SP and BSP.“Whereas during our time, none was closed and payments to farmers were made. We have decided to announce in the BJP manifesto that in case of delay in clearance of payment, the interest will be realised from the sugar mills,” he said.The Union home minister also took part in a road show here and sought support for the BJP candidates in the upcoming elections.Enthusiastic BJP supporters greeted Shah and showered flower petals on him and chanted slogans in support.Uttar Pradesh minister Kapil Dev Aggarwal is BJP’s candidate from Muzaffarnagar, whereas SP-RLD alliance has fielded Saurabh Swarup from the seat.                                       #AkhileshYadav                                     #AmitShah                                     #JayantChaudhary||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-government-chased-away-criminals-and-mafias-who-flourished-during-sp-regime-in-uttar-pradesh-shah-365293

It has already announced to send 50,000 tonnes of wheat and medicines to Afghanistan by road transport through Pakistan.Pakistan last year allowed India to send 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan by using its land route after the humanitarian situation worsened in the wake of the Taliban's takeover of Kabul.Diplomatic sources told The Express Tribune newspaper that the shipment would start in early February.According to the modalities, India has to transport the total amount of wheat within 30 days of the first consignment.The two countries have decided to cooperate on Afghanistan despite their otherwise tense relationship.It took both the sides several weeks of discussions to agree on the modalities.Initially, Pakistan wanted the transportation of humanitarian assistance goods to Kabul in its trucks under the banner of the United Nations.But India made a counter proposal and wanted the food grain to be shipped to Afghanistan either in Indian or Afghan trucks. The two sides then agreed that wheat would be carried by Afghan trucks and a list of Afghan contractors was shared with Pakistan.Foreign Office spokesperson Asim Iftikhar Ahmad told reporters on Friday that all arrangements were now put in place and Pakistan was waiting for the date of the first consignment.India had sent a proposal to Pakistan on October 7 last year seeking the transit facility to send 50,000 tonnes of wheat and life-saving medicines to the people of Afghanistan via the Pakistani soil and it received a response from Islamabad on November 24.Asked about humanitarian aid to Afghanistan at an online media briefing in New Delhi on Friday, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the government is committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, comprising food grains, Covid vaccines and essential life-saving drugs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-wheat-shipment-to-afghanistan-via-pakistani-soil-to-begin-in-early-february-report-365268

29-01-2022||New Delhi||Biases of participants in US meet on human rights in India well-known: MEA||The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has said the “biases and political interests of the participants” were well-known while reacting to a Congressional briefing in the US in which former Vice President Hamid Ansari and four American lawmakers expressed concern over the human rights situation in India.Also read: Ex-VP Hamid Ansari, 4 US lawmakers raise alarm over 'rights abuses' in India“We have seen reports on this event. India is a robust and vibrant democracy. It does not require certification from others. The claim that others need to protect our Constitution is presumptuous and preposterous,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi when asked about the concern expressed by the US lawmakers and Ansari at a virtual panel discussion organised by the Indian American Muslim Council on Wednesday.Among nearly a dozen speakers, Ansari had said, “In recent years, we have experienced the emergence of trends and practices that dispute the well-established principle of civic nationalism and interposes a new and imaginary practice of cultural nationalism….It wants to distinguish citizens on the basis of their faith, give vent to intolerance, insinuate otherness, and promote disquiet and insecurity.”He also urged action against these human rights offences by saying, “These trends need to be contested legally and contested politically.”However, other speakers were much more direct and trenchant in their criticism.Nadine Maenza, Chair of the US Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), called on the State Department to put India in the Red List for human rights offenscs. Kerry Kennedy, the niece of former US President John F Kennedy, highlighted her friendship with jailed Kashmiri activist Khurram Parvez and alleged that New Delhi targets all those who play a critical role of holding governments accountable for human rights abuses.Carolyn Nash of Amnesty International described the Indian Government’s definition of terrorists as “overly broad” and said the stories of human rights defenders suffering under UAPA “must be a wake-up call to show solidarity for civil society and human rights defenders at the front lines of India today”.Meanwhile, the organisers of the event, the Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) said its purpose was that “a strong US-India strategic partnership should be anchored in an understanding that their geopolitical interests are best served by advancing democracy, human rights and religious freedom”.It contested Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi’s allegation that IAMC was linked with the ISI and the banned SIMI. Its only mention is in a Tripura Police report which mentions a website www.thedisinfolab.org, “which has emerged in recent months as a fake news factory connected to the Hindutva disinformation universe,” said IAMC.“This website provides absolutely no information regarding the name of any registered entity that owns it; no registered address or any office address; no names for directors or editors or any other functionaries; no names of any authors of its reports. It is incredible that Tripura Police are actually offering such shady websites as proof against us in the court,” it said.                                     #HamidAnsari                                     #Hindutva                                     #HumanRights||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biases-of-participants-in-us-meet-on-human-rights-in-india-well-known-mea-365264

29-01-2022||Mumbai||Man donates minor daughter to godman; High Court says 'girl is not his property'||A girl is not a property that can be given in donation, the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court observed, while taking strong objection to a case wherein a man had given his 17-year-old daughter in "daan" to a self-styled godman.A single bench of Justice Vibha Kankanwadi made the observation earlier this month while hearing a bail application filed by the godman Shankeshwar Dhakne and his disciple Sopan Dhanke, arrested for allegedly raping the minor girl.The two accused lived in a temple at Badnapur in Jalna district along with the girl and her father. The girl on August 2021 filed FIR against the duo for allegedly raping her, following which they were arrested.Justice Kankanwadi in her order took note of the prosecution's case that in 2018, a document styled as "danpatra" on a stamp paper of Rs 100 was executed between the girl's father and the Dhakne.“It is stated that the father of the girl has given his daughter on donation (daan) to the baba and it is stated that the said 'kanyadan' has been made in the presence of god. When the girl as per her own statement is minor, then why the father, who is in all respect guardian, to the girl, give the girl as Daan?” the court said in its order.“A girl is not a property, which can be given in donation,” Justice Kankanwadi said, adding that this was a disturbing fact.The court noted that it was concerned about the future of the minor girl and “cannot shut its eyes”.This was a fit case where directions needed to be given to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) of Jalna district to hold inquiry on an expeditious basis and find out if the girl was fit to be declared as a child in need of care and protection.“This is in view of the future of the girl and she should not be driven to do any illegal activities,” the court said, directing the CWC to hold its inquiry and submit its report to the court.The court granted bail to the duo on a bond of Rs 25,000 each and posted the matter for further hearing on February 4.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-donates-minor-daughter-to-godman-hc-says-girl-is-not-his-property-365259

Real photos are certified by the family of Bhagat Singh,” Chaman Lal wrote in a letter addressed to Kejriwal.Lal, who is Honorary Advisor, Bhagat Singh Archives and Resource Centre, Delhi, wrote that sometimes the Centre and Punjab government have been found using painting-based unreal pictures of Bhagat Singh in advertisements, which always has been objected to by the Bhagat Singh’s family and scholars of freedom struggle.“Unreal photograph of no other freedom fighter or national icon such as Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Subhas Bose or Ambedkar is used for official purpose. This injustice is done only to Bhagat Singh, Udham Singh and Kartar Singh Sarabha,” Chaman Lal wrote.Lal said that while implementing the laudable decision the Delhi government can also undo the injustice done by the central and many state governments to Bhagat Singh by using his wrong, faulty, unreal and painting-based portraits in advertisements. The Delhi government has already set up Bhagat Singh Archives and Resource Centre and picture of Bhagat Singh can be arranged from the archives.Lal also requested Kejriwal that out of three new universities set up by the Delhi government one may be named after Bhagat Singh. “I suggest that Teachers Training University may be named after Bhagat Singh. Delhi already has universities named after Ambedkar and Netaji Subhas Bose. It will be appropriate to have a university named after Bhagat Singh. Delhi can become the first state to name a university after Bhagat Singh,” Lal wrote in his letter to the Delhi CM.                                     #ArvindKejriwal                                     #BhagatSingh                                     #BRAmbedkar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/avoid-unreal-photographs-of-bhagat-singh-in-offices-scholar-tells-kejriwal-365245

Taking into account the data pertaining to a ‘group’, which would be an amalgamation of certain cadres in a service, would not give the correct picture of the inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in the cadre in relation to which reservation in promotions is sought to be made,” the Bench said.The top court, which had reserved its verdict on the issue on October 26 last year, said a review had to be conducted regarding the data for the purpose of determining the inadequacy of representation for providing reservation in promotion. The period of review should be reasonable, it noted.The verdict can potentially lead to another round of litigation on the contentious issue as the Bench left it to the government to lay down the yardstick to determine inadequacy of representation of SCs and STs in government services and the period of review.The top court fixed February 24 to take up individual petitions, including contempt petitions against senior government officials, which would be decided on the basis of the constitutional principles laid down by it on Friday.It declared that the conclusions in the BK Pavitra (II) case decided in 2019 approving the collection of data on the basis of groups and not cadres was contrary to the verdict in the Jarnail Singh’s case (2018).The verdict came on a batch of petitions on the issue of reservation in promotions to the employees belonging to SC and ST given by the Central Government, various PSUs and state governments in public employment.While upholding the validity of 77th, 81st, 82nd and 85th Amendments on various aspects of reservation in promotions, the SC had in M Nagraj case in 2006 stipulated that in each case the state would have to show existence of “compelling reasons”, including “inadequacy of representation” and overall “administrative efficiency”, before providing reservation in promotions.                                     #Reservation                                     #SupremeCourt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cannot-lay-down-yardstick-for-reservation-in-promotions-supreme-court-365036
