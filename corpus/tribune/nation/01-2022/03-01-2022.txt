03-01-2022||New Delhi||Delhi logs 4,099 new Covid cases, positivity rate jumps to 6.46 pc||Delhi on Monday reported 4,099 fresh COVID-19 cases with a positivity rate of 6.46 per cent, with Health Minister Satyendar Jain saying the Omicron variant of coronavirus is behind the surge in infections in the city and more restrictions will be implemented if bed occupancy rate goes up. The number of new cases and positivity rate in the city is the highest since May 18.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), which devises Covid management policies for the national capital, will hold a crucial meeting on Tuesday to discuss the need for more curbs in view of the alarming spike in cases.A positivity rate of more than 5 per cent for two consecutive days will trigger a ‘red alert’ under the DDMA-approved Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) leading to a ‘total curfew’ and halting of most economic activities.According to the latest government data, only 420 (4.65 per cent) of the 9,029 beds in Delhi hospitals are occupied.As many as 124 patients need oxygen, while seven are on ventilator support.With one more fatality, the death toll due to coronavirus in the city has risen to 25,100.The number of cumulative cases on Monday stood at 14,58,220. Over 14.22 lakh patients have recovered from the infection.Nine COVID-19 deaths were reported in the city in December last year, and seven in November, according to official data.Delhi had recorded four Covid deaths in October and five in September.A total of 63,477 tests – 57,813 RT-PCR tests—were conducted the previous day, the bulletin said.Earlier in the day, Jain told the Delhi Assembly that the latest genome sequencing report shows Omicron has been found in 81 per cent of the samples tested and the new variant of concern is the reason behind the surge in coronavirus cases in the national capital.Of the latest 187 Covid samples tested, 152 had (81 per cent) Omicron and 8.5 per cent had Delta, he said.                         “So, Omicron is the variant spreading now and the share of other variants is very low,” the minister said responding to a question of Leader of Opposition Ramvir Bidhuri.     He also told the Assembly that none of the Omicron-infected patients admitted to the city hospitals had required oxygen so far.Though there is a spike in the number of Covid cases, the situation is under control as not many people are developing severe symptoms or require hospitalisation, he said.The minister stressed that the home isolation policy is very effective in Omicron cases as most of the patients do not have any symptoms. A few of them have developed low-grade fever and cold, but there has been no severe case due to Omicron.“Till Sunday, there were around 8,000 active cases in Delhi and just 3.4 per cent of the total 9,024 Covid beds in the hospitals were occupied. There were around 1,500 to 2,000 patients in the hospitals when Delhi reported an equal number of active cases the last time,” Jain said.He added that more restrictions will be imposed if the bed occupancy rate goes up.Jain said Delhi is the first state to order a closure of schools and impose restrictions on gatherings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, while other states have only imposed a night curfew.“People ask why Delhi has imposed such stringent curbs when no one else has done it. Delhi is the national capital and most of the international flights come to the city first. So it is better to have more restrictions here than anywhere else,” he said.Delhi reported 3,194 Covid cases with a positivity rate of 4.59 per cent on Sunday and 2,716 cases with a positivity rate of 3.6 per cent on Saturday.On Friday and Thursday, 1,796 and 1,313 cases were recorded with a positivity rate of 1.73 per cent and 2.44 per cent respectively, according to official figures. The daily case tally on Wednesday, Tuesday and Monday were 923, 496 and 331, respectively.Delhi had reported 4,482 cases on May 18 last year with a positivity rate of 6.89 per cent.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said though the city is witnessing a sharp spike in the number of daily cases and active cases of coronavirus, there is no need to panic as most patients are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms and do not need hospitalisation.    On December 28, the DDMA declared a ‘yellow alert’ under the GRAP amid a spike in Covid cases following the emergence of the coronavirus’ Omicron variant.A day later, it decided that Covid-related curbs under the “yellow alert” would continue and the authorities would monitor the situation for a while before deciding on fresh restrictions.According to GRAP, the Yellow or Level 1 alert kicks in if the case positivity rate crosses 0.5 per cent for two consecutive days or cumulative daily positive cases (seven-day rolling average) cross 1,500 or average oxygenated bed occupancy (seven-day average) is above 500.The Amber or Level 2 alert is imposed if the case positivity is more than 1 per cent for two consecutive days, or cumulative daily average cases are 3,500 or if bed occupancy is over 700.Level 3 (Orange) and Level 4 (Red) alerts can be considered if the positivity rate is over 2 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. Other criteria for level 3 and level 4 alerts are 9,000 and 16,000 cumulative daily cases and 1,000 and 3,000 occupied beds respectively.

Sorry, we cannot entertain this,” it said.Guruswamy said that on December 13 last year, the top court had not expressed any opinion on merit and that a similar issue was pending before it and therefore, the court may issue notice and tag it along with that matter. But the court didn’t oblige her.Earlier, the Calcutta High Court had stayed criminal proceedings against the BJP leader in three cases—his bodyguard’s death, an alleged political clash in Nandigram and a case of snatching lodged in Contai, Nandigram and Panskura police stations in Purba Medinipur district.Another Bench of the court adjourned Adhikari’s plea for transfer of TMC leader and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee’s petition pending in Calcutta HC challenging his electoral victory over her at Nandigram to a High Court outside the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rejects-west-bengal-govts-plea-against-protection-given-to-bjp-leader-suvendu-adhikari-357838
03-01-2022||New Delhi||In UP, Akhilesh Yadav woos Brahmins to counter BJP||On Sunday while Prime Minister Narendra Modi was praising Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for his tough stance against mafia and criminals while hitting out at BJP’s main rival Samajwadi Party in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, former CM Akhilesh Yadav was offering prayers to Lord Parshuram at a temple “constructed by Samajwadi leaders” in Lucknow.The gesture is being seen as yet another attempt by the regional satrap to woo “around 10 to 12 per cent” Brahmin voters in the state.Yadav was joined by a number of leaders from the community at the temple on the Purvanchal Expressway where hoardings reading “Brahmin ka sankalp, Akhilesh hi vikalp (Brahmin’s pledge, Akhilesh the only option)”, had been put up.Yadav was also quoted as saying that if voted to power, his party will declare Parshuram Jayanti as a public holiday.According to Samajwadi Party  leaders, “Brahmins are very happy with Akhilesh Yadav” though as per leaders from the BJP, which too has in place a counter strategy against Samajwadi Party’s ‘Brahmin’ outreach’, these are all “false assumptions”.Meanwhile, observers believe the politically significant community, which otherwise has been favourable towards the BJP, is “weighing its options”.The buzz is that senior BJP leaders from the community are “also not too happy over the treatment meted out to them by Adityanath in the past five years”.     The BJP’s committee aims at dispelling “all these falsehoods and confusion being spread among Brahmins by rivals SP and BSP that the saffron party is neglecting their community”.Brahmins comprise a sizable percentage of votes and are also significant in terms of having influence beyond their actual numbers.“In rural areas and villages, the panditji of the local temple is among the influencers,” the observers say.          As far as UP is concerned, Brahmins remained loyal to the Congress before the politics of mandir-mandal took over. In the 2007 assembly elections they also majorly supported Mayawati’s BSP. However, somewhere around the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and the arrival of Prime Minister Modi on the scene, the scale tilted towards the BJP. A vast majority, around 70 per cent of the community, are said to have voted for the saffron party in 2014.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-up-akhilesh-yadav-woos-brahmins-to-counter-bjp-357836

Yet the Modi government is trying to save the accused. India is a witness! #Lakhimpur #Farmers” he said in a tweet in Hindi, using the hashtag seeking dismissal of MoS Ajay Mishra.Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said “false apologies” and withdrawal of farm laws would not help “cover-up Modi’s anti-farmer mindset”.“They are in the position of protector but stand with the destroyer. In the charge sheet of the Lakhimpur Kheri massacre case, the son of the Union Minister of State for Home is the main accused in the crushing of farmers,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.“But due to Narendra Modi ji’s patronage, Minister Ajay Mishra Teni did not even come under the scrutiny of the investigation and he remains in his post,” Priyanka Gandhi Vadra alleged and demanded the sacking of Ajay Mishra Teni.Four farmers were allegedly mowed down by an SUV in the Lakhimpur Kheri district, the native place of MoS Home Ajay Mishra on October 3 last year. In the ensuing violence, four people, including a journalist and two BJP workers, were also killed.

03-01-2022||---||SC asks Centre to respond to Inner Line Permit system in Manipur||New Delhi, January 3The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre and the Manipur Government to respond to a petition challenging the state’s Inner Line Permit (ILP) system that restricted entry and exit of non-permanent residents of the state.Issuing notice on the petition filed by ‘Amra Bangalee’, a Bench led by Justice Abdul Nazeer posted the matter for hearing after four weeks.Introduced by the Adaptation of Laws (Amendment) Order, 2019, which extended the 140-year-old “colonial legislation” Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations, 1873 (BEFR), the ILP system originally created a monopoly over tea plantations in Assam. It was aimed to protect British commercial interests in the hilly areas as the BEFR prohibited Indians from engaging in trade with the tribal people in the areas covered under it. In those days Assam was a part of Bengal.By a 2019 order, the ILP system was made applicable to Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram and districts of Nagaland notified from time to time.The petitioner alleged that the 2019 order went against the fundamental rights of citizens guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 (right to equality, right to non-discrimination, right to freely move across India and right to personal liberty) of the Indian Constitution as it gave unqualified powers to the state to restrict the entry and exit of non-indigenous persons.“The draconian ILP system is fundamentally opposed to the policies of social integration, development and technological advancement in the area beyond the Inner Line, apart from hampering tourism within the state, which is a major source of revenue generation for these areas,” the petitioner said.“The effect of the ILP system in the State of Manipur is that no person who is not a resident of the said State is permitted to enter the State or engage in business there without applying for a special permit known as “Inner Line Permit,” the petitioner submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-centre-to-respond-to-inner-line-permit-system-in%C2%A0manipur-357829
03-01-2022||New Delhi||Sameer Wankhede’s tenure with Mumbai NCB ends; sent back to DRI||The tenure of controversial NCB Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede with the federal anti-narcotics agency has ended and his services have been put at the disposal of his parent organisation DRI, officials said on Monday.The charge of the NCB Mumbai zonal unit will be handled in an additional capacity by its Indore zonal director Brijendra Chowdhary.Wankhede, an Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer of the 2008 batch, was sent to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) Mumbai zone in August 2020 “on loan” from the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) in the wake of the drugs probe being conducted by the agency into the death of 34-year-old actor Sushant Singh Rajput.He had been serving as the head or the zonal director of the NCB Mumbai unit since August 31, 2020, and was given some extensions.Wankhede’s extended tenure with the NCB ended on December 31, 2021 and as there has been no order for his extension, he has been sent back to his parent organisation DRI, that functions as an investigation agency under the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), they said.Wankhede has been in the limelight following the high-profile October, 2021 raids by the NCB on a Mumbai cruise after which the agency arrested Aryan Khan,  the son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, and several others and claimed to have siezed some narcotics too.Soon after this action, Maharashtra minister and NCP leader levelled multiple charges of alleged misconduct and corruption against the officer. Wankhede has denied the allegations.The NCB, under Wankhede, had earlier arrested Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan in a narcotics case and the agency has recently moved the Bombay High Court to cancel the bail given to the latter in this case.

They then marched to the police commissionerate to submit a memorandum on Kalicharan Maharaj’s arrest,” said Savita Choudhary, in charge of Choti Gwaltoli police station.She said, as per a prohibitory order of the district collector, rallies, processions and dharnas cannot be held in public places without the prior permission of the administration.“An FIR has been registered against the protesters for violation of this order under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant),” Choudhary said.Choudhary said she was unaware if the protesting crowd shouted slogans praising Godse.Meanwhile, Congress spokesperson Aminul Khan Suri shared a video of the protests, in which pro-Godse slogans can be heard, and said it took place near the commissionerate and the police remained mute spectators.The police should book them under sedition rather than the lighter provisions that have been invoked currently, he said.Kalicharan was held from MP by Chhattisgarh police last week. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-mob-booked-in-indore-for-holding-rally-to-support-kalicharan-maharaj-357823
03-01-2022||Islamabad||Pakistan ready to host SAARC Summit, India can join virtually: Foreign Minister Qureshi||Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said on Monday that his country was ready to host the 19th SAARC Summit and India can join it virtually if the leadership in New Delhi is not willing to visit Islamabad.Addressing a press conference to highlight the achievements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2021, Qureshi accused India of making SAARC dysfunctional through its stubbornness by refusing to come to Islamabad for the Summit meeting.“I reiterate the invitation for the 19th SAARC summit. If India is not ready to come to Islamabad, it can join virtually… but it should not stop others from attending the moot,” he said.SAARC — a regional grouping comprising Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — has not been very effective since 2016 and its biennial summits have not taken place since the last one in Kathmandu in 2014.The 2016 SAARC Summit was originally planned to be held in Islamabad on November 15-19, 2016. But after a terror attack on an Indian Army camp in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir on September 18 that year, India expressed its inability to participate in the summit due to “prevailing circumstances”.The summit was called off after Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan also declined to participate in the Islamabad meet.Noting that there was no change in relations with India in 2021, Qureshi cited the alleged dominance of “Hindutva thinking” in India for sabotaging the prospects of good ties between the two countries.“Unfortunately, ties with India in 2021 were frozen. In our view, the potential of regional cooperation has been hit by aggressive Hindutva behaviour in recent years,” he said.He said Pakistan wanted peaceful ties with all its neighbours, including India, but the responsibility for improving the relations was on India.Qureshi said peace with India was not possible without resolving the Kashmir issue.The bilateral relations deteriorated after India withdrew the special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the state into two union territories in August, 2019.India has told Pakistan that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Islamabad in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence.Qureshi dwelt at length on Pakistan’s ties with the rest of the world and concluded by saying that political, economic and diplomatic relations improved last year with the entire world, including the US, Russia and China.Qureshi specially mentioned that the ties with Bangladesh were improving and Prime Minister Imran Khan has interacted with his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina.He said Khan invited Hasina to visit Pakistan who also invited him to visit Bangladesh.To a question on the reported ‘Cold War’ between China and the United States, he said Pakistan’s policy was clear and Islamabad will not become a “part of any camp”.Responding to another question on removal of fencing by the Taliban forces on the border, he said Pakistan carried out the fencing work and was aware of the latest incidents (of its removal) while adding that “Afghanistan is our friend and we will be able to resolve it.”      Qureshi’s remarks on the SAARC Summit came after Pakistan Prime Minister Khan last month expressed hope that his country would host the much-delayed meeting when the “artificial obstacle” created in its way is removed.Khan made the remarks during his meeting with Secretary-General of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Esala Ruwan Weerakoon, who paid a courtesy call on the Prime Minister here.

03-01-2022||New Delhi||Omicron in 81 per cent of latest samples tested for Covid: Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain||Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Monday said the latest genome-sequencing report shows that Omicron was found in 81 per cent of the samples tested for COVID-19 in the City and the new variant of concern is the reason behind the surge in the number of coronavirus cases in the Capital.Of the latest 187 Covid samples tested, 152 (81 per cent) had Omicron and 8.5 per cent had Delta, Jain told the Delhi Assembly.“So Omicron is the variant spreading now and the share of other variants is very low,” he said, responding to a question from Leader of Opposition Ramvir Bidhuri.Earlier in the day, Jain told reporters that Omicron accounted for 84 per cent of the latest Covid samples tested in Delhi.He also told the Assembly that none of the Omicron-infected patients admitted to the city hospitals had required oxygen so far.“Till Sunday, there were around 8,000 active cases in Delhi and just 3.4 per cent of the total 9,024 Covid beds in the hospitals were occupied. There were around 1,500 to 2,000 patients in the hospitals when Delhi reported an equal number of active cases the last time,” Jain said.He added that more restrictions will be imposed if the bed occupancy rate goes up.The minister said Omicron came to India around December 1 through infected international passengers.“We conduct RT-PCR tests on all international passengers at the airport. Those who test positive are sent to institutional quarantine at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan hospital and some private hospitals,” he said.“Some of the passengers who tested negative at the airport turned out positive at home after some days. Their entire families and contacts turned out Covid positive. So it is clear that Omicron spread when these people went home after testing negative at the airport,” Jain added.He said the Delhi government has repeatedly requested the Centre to stop all international flights to prevent the spread of Omicron in the country, but the latter did not do so.“Everyone knew Omicron did not originate in India. It came from foreign countries. I repeatedly requested the Centre, the chief minister (Arvind Kejriwal) wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to stop all international flights. But they did not do so,” he said.Jain said though there is a spike in the number of Covid cases, the situation is under control as not many people are developing severe symptoms or require hospitalisation.According to the health bulletin to be issued later in the day, the capital has recorded around 4,000 new coronavirus cases and the positivity rate has gone up to 6.5 per cent, he said.The minister stressed that the home isolation policy is very effective in Omicron cases as most of the patients do not have any symptoms. A few of them have developed low-grade fever and cold but there has been no severe case due to Omicron.Jain also said Delhi is the first state to order a closure of schools and impose restrictions on gatherings to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, while other states have only imposed a night curfew.“People ask why Delhi has imposed such stringent curbs when no one else has done it. Delhi is the national capital and most of the international flights come to the city first. So it is better to have more restrictions here than anywhere else,” he said.“We will implement more restrictions if the bed occupancy rate goes up,” the minister added.Delhi has administered at least one dose of the Covid vaccines to all eligible people aged above 18 years and 75 per cent of them have been fully vaccinated, he said, adding, “I think Delhi is at number one (position) in terms of vaccination.”      The national capital added 3,194 new cases to its COVID-19 tally on Sunday with a positivity rate of 4.59 per cent, but the chief minister asked people not to panic, saying most patients are either asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms and do not need hospitalisation.A positivity rate of more than five per cent for two consecutive days would trigger a “red” alert under the Delhi Disaster Management Authority-approved Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).It would lead to a “total curfew” and most economic activities would come to a halt.Sunday saw the highest single-day rise in the number of Covid cases since May 20 and it was 17 per cent higher than the 2,716 cases registered a day before. The city also reported one more fatality due to the viral disease, taking the death toll to 25,109.Experts believe that a large number of the new cases were caused by the highly contagious Omicron variant of the virus.Sources in the government said the situation is being monitored closely and a decision to escalate the restrictions will be based on the bed occupancy rate.

This is another feather in the cap of India’s vaccination drive,” Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya  said in a tweet.Over 51 lakh youngsters had registered on the CoWIN portal till Monday 8.30 pm after the process started on January 1. An estimated 7.4 crore children are there in this age group.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India has taken an important step forward in protecting its youth population against the disease.“Congrats to all my young friends between the age group of 15-18 who got vaccinated. Congrats to their parents as well. I would urge more youngsters to get vaccinated in the coming days!” he said on Twitter.The vaccination campaign started on January 16 last year in a staggered manner, and many youngsters like Harmanjot Singh said they were keen to get the jab as soon as it was allowed for their age group.“I was waiting for the day to get my dose of the vaccine as the pandemic forced us to stay at our homes most of the time. We want to get back to regular school and other activities as soon as possible,” said Singh, a student of class 11 at a private school in Jammu.With the drive starting mostly from schools, many principals and other officials said they received a positive response from students and their families.“Whenever schools reopened in the midst of the pandemic, I was hesitant to send my son. It will be a relief now that he has received the vaccine,” said Savita Devi, whose son was waiting to get the jab at a Delhi government school.Some students referred to restrictions on travelling and said they did not want to miss out on activities because they are not vaccinated.“This was long-awaited. The third wave is already here and considering how aggressive the second wave was, we were all afraid,” said Ritesh Ghosh, a 17-year-old student.Echoing similar sentiments, Reema Dutta, 15, said there is a sense of relief among people of her age group and they are looking forward to resuming their normal activities once vaccinated against the coronavirus.“We can go outdoors while following COVID protocols once we have received the vaccination. The omicron is already scaring us”, she said.But there were some like Diksha Patel, 17, from Raipur in Chhattisgarh who required some counselling from her family and friends to overcome hesitancy.“On Sunday, our class teacher posted a message on our WhatsApp group about coming to school and getting vaccinated. I was worried as many of my family members fell ill after taking the vaccine during the second wave in April and May last year,” Patel, a class 9 student of JR Dani Government High School, said.“However, my mother and other family members spoke to me about the benefits of vaccination, especially in view of rising cases and a possible third wave,” she told PTI.Reflecting the urgency in the country as it stares at a possible third COVID-19 wave, leaders on Monday called for taking up the drive on a war footing, while Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope suggested that those in the 12-15 age bracket should also be allowed to get inoculated.On December 25, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the inclusion of the 15 to 18 age group in the nationwide COVID immunisation programme from January 3.The vaccine option for this age group would only be Covaxin, according to guidelines issued by the Union health ministry on December 27.Meanwhile, the Centre on Monday dismissed reports alleging expired COVID-19 vaccines are being administered in India as “false and misleading”.It clarified that the national regulator had approved the shelf life extension of Covishield and Covaxin in February and October 2021 respectively.“There have been some media reports alleging that expired vaccines are being administered in India under its national COVID-19 vaccination programme. This is false and misleading and based on incomplete information,” the health ministry said in a statement.India’s COVID-19 tally rose to 3,49,22,882 with 33,750 fresh cases, while the active cases increased to 1,45,582, according to the data updated at 8 AM on Monday.“I did not have any fear of vaccination. I will encourage my other friends to come and get themselves vaccinated as soon as possible,” said 17-year-old girl Poorvi Nakar in Agra, Uttar Pradesh.In Mumbai, a girl student was the first to receive the vaccine dose at a jumbo COVID-19 centre in the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), where the drive was virtually launched by Maharashtra Tourism and Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray.Mumbai has witnessed a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases since the second half of last month.The city’s civic body said vaccines will be given free of cost to children of all schools.In neighbouring Pune, the vaccination campaign for children commenced at 40 centres on Monday, the city civic body’s chief immunisation officer Dr Suryakant Devkar said.“The beneficiary children were offered a rose, a pen and a mask after the vaccination,” Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said.Parents accompanied their children to the vaccination centres and the teenagers appeared happy and excited to take to jabs against the viral infection, he said.Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor Manoj Sinha launched the drive at a government school in Jammu.“In the coming week, the targeted population (8.33 lakh) will be vaccinated,” he told reporters.As many as 822 vaccination sites have been set up across 20 districts for the vaccination of the children, officials said, appealing to the youngsters to come forward and get themselves vaccinated.Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin urged people to diligently follow precautions as the country entered the next phase of vaccination.“I do not wish to cause trepidation. Experts say the Omicron variant, which has emerged as a new threat, is highly transmissible though its impact is less severe compared to previous COVID variants. So, face-mask and vaccine against Coronavirus would serve as a shield to protect us now,” the chief minister said starting the drive.Tamil Nadu hopes to administer the jabs to about 33.46 lakh school children in a month’s time Assam, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttrakhand, Odisha, Karnataka, West Bengal, Puducherry, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh were among the states and Union territories that began the drive on Monday.“We have to hold the vaccination drive on a war footing. Crisis management committees, MPs, MLAs, social workers, volunteers, religious leaders, all are requested to appeal to the children to get vaccinated,” Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said.In Gujarat, Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel launched the drive at a school in Koba area of the state capital Gandhinagar.The Gujarat health department has prepared around 3,500 centres across the state for the special vaccination campaign, and has said it will extend the daily timings of the drive from the current schedule of 9 am to 6 pm.Starting the drive from Dimapur District Hospital, Nagaland Health Minister S Pangyu Phom appealed to the people to come forward and get inoculated.Kerala Health Minister Veena George said pink boards have been put up at Children’s Vaccination Centres to avoid confusion.

03-01-2022||New Delhi||OBC reservation: SC to hear matters related to Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh on January 17||The Supreme Court on Monday said it would hear on January 17 the matters in which it had directed the state election commissions of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh to re-notify the seats reserved for the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the local bodies in these states under the general category.The court said the application filed by the Centre, which has sought a recall of its December 17 last year order directing the Madhya Pradesh State Election Commission to stay the poll process on the seats reserved for the OBCs in the local bodies there and re-notify those under the general category, would be heard on January 17.“This will come up on January 17,” a Bench of justices A M Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar said.One of the advocates appearing for the petitioner in the matter concerning Madhya Pradesh told the Bench that his matter has become infructuous as the ordinance against which he had moved the court has been withdrawn.“All these matters will be heard together,” the Bench said.Appearing for the Centre, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the court that the Union government has issued directions regarding the compliance of the verdicts delivered by a Constitution Bench as well as a three-judge Bench of the top court earlier.“We have done that,” Mehta told the Bench, adding, “We have also moved an application seeking some relief in the matter.”              The Bench said the application would be listed on January 17.In its December 17 order, the apex court had referred to the Constitution Bench verdict of 2010 that had mentioned three conditions, including the setting up of a dedicated commission to conduct a contemporaneous rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of the backwardness qua the local bodies in the states, which are required to be followed before provisioning such reservation for the OBC category.It had also said that subsequently, a three-judge Bench of the court had reiterated the same.The apex court had observed on December 17 that it had passed an order on December 15, directing the State Election Commission of Maharashtra to notify the seats in the local bodies that were reserved for the OBCs as general category seats.In its application seeking a recall of the December 17 order, the Centre has said the uplift of the Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and OBCs has been its utmost priority and an inadequate representation of OBCs in the local bodies defeats the “very object, intent and purpose of the idea” of de-centralisation of power and taking governance to the grassroots level.It also urged the court to direct the local body elections to be deferred for four months with a mandate to the state government to come out with the report of the commission and directing the SEC to hold the elections accordingly.The Centre has requested the top court to suspend the election process as an interim measure.It has also sought impleadment in the matter in which the court had passed the order on December 17. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/obc-reservation-sc-to-hear-matters-related-to-maharashtra-madhya-pradesh-on-january-17-357803
03-01-2022||Aditi Tandon||Congress launches Uttarakhand poll theme song, slogan||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 3The Congress on Monday launched the election campaign theme song for the upcoming Uttarakhand elections and said polls would be fought with people as the face of the party.Putting up a united front days after intra-party rivalries in the state came to the fore, Congress Uttrakhand campaign head and former chief minister Harish Rawat, state unit chief Ganesh Godiyal, AICC in charge Devendra Yadav and senior leader Pritam Singh said the theme song was a marker of the changing mood of the people.Rawat, who recently took to Twitter to complain of sabotage in the state unit, on Monday said, “People of Uttarakhand will be the face of the Congress in the upcoming elections. And people have made up their minds to change the government.”The Congress said no decision had been taken in the state on one family, one ticket rule – something the Punjab Congress recently resolved to do and publicly declared.“Some decisions have been taken in Punjab. We will discuss these matters, decide and let you know. People have decided who will come. The Congress is the first preference of the people of the state,” AICC state in charge Yadav said with Uttarakhand Congress chief Ganesh Godiyal adding that no one had voiced any objection to the rule even though deliberations on the same were ongoing.The punch line of the Congress theme song in the state is ‘Teen Tigada Kaam Bigada, Uttarakhand mein nahi aayegi ab Bhajpa dobara’ – a pun on the ruling BJP changing three CMs in five years.“The song signals the importance of the 2022 elections, and calls for change. Today, we are seeking change not only for power but preservation of democracy, to fight the concept of development which has been distorted. The Centre has also acknowledged the failure of the double engine government by changing the CMs thrice. One CM was piloting the state budget as finance minister when he was changed. This was an insult to parliamentary conventions. The people were never told why he was changed. In 2013 also, a change happened but people were told the reason behind the same. The then CM had failed to handle the Kedarnath tragedy,” Rawat said.Rawat said the reason behind the replacement of the second CM would remain a mystery known only to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.The Congress veteran said the third CM was also going to become a casualty but somehow managed to stay.“Uttarakhand is feeling a sense of insult. Uttrakhand reported the highest Covid death rate in the country. We are proud of the Kumbh but during the Kumbh the BJP government mismanaged Covid and indulged in a testing scandal. In inflation and unemployment our state is number one in the country. When the Congress comes, we will work for social welfare and inclusion, mitigation of the impacts of inflation. We will not only offer subsidies but also become the support system of the poor and the disadvantaged,” Rawat assured.The Congress, meanwhile, saw three leaders joining its fold in the state -  Anant Chauhan (veteran working president of AAP), Uttarkashi's sitting zila panchayat head Deepak Gujran and former BJP MLA Mal Chand.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-launches-uttarakhand-poll-theme-song-slogan-357800

States and UTs are also advised to share their requirement of vaccine doses through district-wise estimation of beneficiaries using Co-WIN. They were urged to plan for distribution of Covaxin to identify session sites well in advance and publish sessions for at least 15 days to provide sufficient visibility,” the health ministry said on Monday as India rushed to inoculate people to contain the spread of omicron with new cases rising for the sixth day.The second dose to 15-18 year olds will be given after 28 days of the first.As the child vaccinations started, Health Ministry Additional Secretary Vikas Sheel tweeted, “ Only COVAXIN is approved for less than 18 years.

Validations in place in Co-WIN.”As of Sunday night, 145.7 crore doses had been administered to adults in India. The government said 90 per cent adults had received the first dose and 65 per cent had received both doses."In the fight against Covid, India’s national Covid vaccination programme has been one of the most successful and largest compared to many developed Western nations with significantly low population base to vaccinate," the health ministry said. It said in case of first dose coverage to the eligible population, the US has covered only 73.2 per cent of the population, the UK 75.9 per cent and France 78.3 per cent.Similarly, for the second dose of vaccine, the US has covered only 61.5 per cent of its population, the UK 69.5 and France 73.2 per cent.“India has covered over 65 per cent of the eligible population with the second dose of vaccine against Covid.

However, the ground situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is not ‘sweet’.Situation stays tenseThe troop build-up on either side along the 832-km LAC in eastern Ladakh shows no signs of getting back to the pre-April 2020 level.The exchange of sweets was just a medium to keep in touch, sources say, adding that since May 2020, local commanders have had almost 1,700 interactions in eastern Ladakh over hotline or in the form of physical meetings.Apart from the build-up in eastern Ladakh, the situation is sensitive in other areas of Tibet lying north of Sikkim and north of Arunachal Pradesh. There has been a rapid build-up by China, including new habitations and roads.Multiple military exercises have been carried out and the latest is the Chinese attempt of renaming places in Arunachal Pradesh. From January 1, China’s new law on its own boundary kicked in. It says that the sovereignty and territorial integrity are sacred and inviolable, and lays emphasis on safeguarding the territorial integrity and land boundaries.The last meeting on October 10, 2021, at the level of Lieutenant General, had ended in a deadlock.On October 10, China had diverted from the laid-down agenda for the talks — disengaging from Patrolling Point 15 (Hot Springs). The existing impasse is over PP 15 and the Depsang Bulge.On October 11, the Ministry of Defence had issued a statement, saying: “The Indian side made constructive suggestions for resolving the remaining areas (of friction along the LAC), but the Chinese side was not agreeable.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sweet-gesture-but-lac-standoff-far-from-over-357466

Yet disturbing evidence emerged in 2021 to reveal how women faced a lifetime of violence.The results of the largest-ever study on the prevalence of violence against women showed that almost one in three women globally had been subjected to physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner or sexual violence from a non-partner during their lifetime. Besides, exposure to violence at home likely increased during the pandemic.The report, “Global, regional and national estimates for intimate partner violence against women and global and regional estimates for non-partner sexual violence against women”, has been prepared by the WHO and the UNDP-UNFPA-UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Special Programme of Research for the United Nations Inter-Agency Working Group on Violence Against Women Estimation and Data.It stated that violence against women remained devastatingly pervasive and started at an alarmingly young age.Across their lifetime, one in three women, around 736 million, are subjected to physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner or sexual violence from a non-partner — a number that has remained largely unchanged over the past decade, the researchers said.This violence starts early: one in four young women (15-24 years) who have been in a relationship will have already experienced violence by an intimate partner by the time they reach their mid-twenties. “Violence against women is endemic in every country and culture, causing harm to millions of women and their families, and has been exacerbated by the Covid pandemic,” Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General, said while acknowledging the leadership of women in the battle against Covid.To rectify past injustices, the WHO had last year even conferred a posthumous award on Henrietta Lacks, who in 1951 had tumour samples taken without her consent during her treatment for cervical cancer.Lacks’s life was cut short at the age of 31, but her cells contributed to nearly 75,000 studies, paving the way for advancements from HPV and polio vaccines to medications for HIV/AIDS and breakthroughs, including in vitro fertilisation.The UN report concluded that violence disproportionately affected women living in low- and lower-middle-income countries.An estimated 37 per cent of women living in the poorest countries experienced physical or sexual intimate partner violence in their life, with some of these countries having a prevalence as high as one in two.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/when-women-led-covid-fight-faced-growing-violence-357469

Today, they are bringing laurels to the country,” PM Modi said.Remembering Major Dhyan Chand, the PM said his government gave priority to Indian players by providing them with resources, modern facilities for training, international exposure and transparency in selection.“The new National Education Policy lays emphasis on sports. Sports have now been kept in the same category as science and commerce.

03-01-2022||Lucknow||Yogi govt only built crematoriums: Kejriwal||AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday tore into Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, saying he only constructed crematoriums in the state and made “arrangements” to dispatch a large number of people there, apparently referring to the second Covid wave.Addressing his party’s rally here, the Delhi CM said Covid-19 arrangements in UP earned a bad name for the state and now in a cover-up exercise, the state government was splurging public money on advertisements.In an apparent reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the AAP leader said, “In 2017, the BJP’s tallest leader had said if ‘kabristans’ (cemeteries) are made in Uttar Pradesh, then ‘samshans’ (crematoriums) should also come up. Unfortunately, Adityanath in the past five years only constructed crematoriums and made arrangements to send a large section of citizens there.”He said UP had earned a bad name for making bad arrangements during the second Covid wave.“If there was any state in the world that had made the worst arrangements to deal with the pandemic, it was Uttar Pradesh,” he said.“To cover its misdemeanour, the UP government had given 10-page advertisements in US magazines, splurging the hard-earned money of people,” he alleged.The AAP’s convener said while his rivals were good at “constructing graveyards and crematoriums”, he knows “how to get schools and hospitals constructed”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yogi-govt-only-built-crematoriums-kejri-357465

The committee in its report submitted on December 31 last year to the Centre said, “The current gross annual family income limit for EWS of Rs 8 lakh or less may be retained. In other words, only those families whose annual income is up to Rs 8 lakh would be eligible to get the benefit of EWS reservation.”The process to revisit the criterion delayed the NEET-PG 2021 counselling, which led to wide-scale protests by a large number of doctors in Delhi and other parts of the country. They were seeking expeditious removal of the legal impediments.The protesting doctors had pointed out that due to a delay of eight months in counselling of the NEET-PG 2021 batch, there was an “acute shortage” of resident doctors across the country.Meanwhile, the three-member panel in its report said, “The current limit of annual family income of Rs 8 lakhs does not seem to be over-inclusive. It should be noted that the income includes salary and that from agriculture as well.”The panel recommended: “EWS may, however exclude, irrespective of income, a person whose family has five acres or more of agricultural land.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-retain-8l-income-norm-for-ews-quota-centre-to-sc-357447

The Bill seeks to bring the age of marriage for girls in India on a par with boys at 21 and has generated a heated debate across the spectrum. The parliamentary committee that will study the Bill is chaired by BJP’s Vinay Sahasrabuddhe. It has 31 members with Sushmita Dev as the sole woman represented in the committee.This panel is among the eight parliamentary standing committees administered by the Rajya Sabha as against 16 department-related committees managed by the Lok Sabha. Ever since the introduction of the marriage age bill in the LS, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has flagged the move in several public rallies as a major step forward towards gender justice, parity and women’s equality and empowerment.The Bll seeks to amend the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 and was born out of the recommendations of a task force the government had set up under former Samata Party chief Jaya Jaitly.Member, Health, NITI Aayog VK Paul was among the task force members.While submitting the report to the government in December 2020, Jaitly had said, “The discussion on gender parity cannot be selective. When we speak of gender equality in every field, we cannot selectively leave out the field of marriage-related choices for girls and boys. If we retain the current legal age of marriage for women at 18 years and for boys at 21 years, we acknowledge that it is acceptable for boys to get more time to seek education and prepare for life while girls can cut down on those same choices and get married early.”The task force members said they had engaged several stakeholders across religious groups, especially youngsters in universities, colleges and rural areas, and everyone had said the marriageable age for girls should be 22 or 23 years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmcs-dev-sole-woman-on-panel-to-review-bill-357451

CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) and police in Delhi and Mumbai are coordinating further action.”The Delhi and Mumbai Police have registered separate cases. In Delhi, a journalist lodged a complaint with the cyber cell, alleging her pictures had been uploaded on the app. She took to Twitter informing that her complaint had been registered and a case under Sections 153A (promoting enmity on grounds of religion etc), 153B (imputations prejudicial to national integration), 354A & 509 (sexual harassment) had been filed.The app was almost similar to “Sulli Deals” app upload in July last year. “Sulli” and “Bulli” are slang words used derogatorily for Muslim women. GitHub was the host for both apps. The app encouraged people to participate in the “auction”.After “Bulli Bai” app uploaded pictures of Muslim women taken from their social media accounts, it sparked outrage among political parties and netizens. The National Commission for Women has written to the Delhi Police to expedite action and ensure that such crime does not recur.In Mumbai, Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi said the matter was with the police and the culprit should be arrested at the earliest.Last year, the Union Government had cited offending content against women as one of the reasons for framing the new digital rules that called for intermediaries for identifying the user hosting the offensive content within 24 hours. Two FIRs were filed by the Delhi and UT Police in the “Sulli Deals” incident last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bulli-bai-app-targeting-muslim-women-shut-357454
03-01-2022||---||India adds more than 46K active Covid cases in 6 days||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 2As new Covid infections in India rose for the fifth straight day with 61 per cent rise in active cases in six days, the Health Ministry told states that Omicron-induced surge could overwhelm health systems and the need to be prepared was pressing.Omicron count reaches 1,525Omicron cases rose to 1,525 on Sunday, with Maharashtra recording a maximum of 460 cases, Delhi 351, Gujarat 136, Tamil Nadu 117 and Kerala 109. Delhi reported 3,194 Covid cases, the highest single-day rise since May 20, as the positivity rate rose to 4.59 per cent.Ramp up infraStates should leave no stone unturned in ramping up the infrastructure to manage a high surge so that India escapes unscathed from this episode of Covid. — Mansukh Mandaviya, Health MinisterNoting that nations globally were experiencing Omicron-related surges which were three to four times the previous peak levels, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, in a review meeting with states and UTs, today said no stone could be left unturned in the mission to ramp up the health infrastructure.He reminded the states that they had used a tad more than 17 per cent of the available approved funds under the Emergency Covid Response Package (ECRP-II).The package was released last year to help states prepare for a potential third wave and set up oxygen and paediatric beds, medical oxygen plants, ventilators and operationalise Covid facilities for institutional quarantining, besides arranging for ambulances.“Globally, countries are experiencing three to four times the surge in Covid cases in comparison to their earlier peaks. The Omicron variant being highly transmissible, a high surge in cases can overwhelm the medical system. States should leave no stone unturned in ramping up the infrastructure to manage a high surge so that India escapes unscathed from this episode of Covid,” Mandaviya told the meeting held in virtual mode.The minister also held a discussion on various aspects of Covid management, including ramping up of the hospital infrastructure, increased testing, stringent restrictive measures for breaking the chain of transmission and stress on Covid-appropriate behaviour. Critical bottlenecks in the medical infrastructure were discussed, with Mandaviya urging the states to expedite the ECRP-II progress.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-adds-more-than-46k-active-covid-cases-in-6-days-357459
03-01-2022||New Delhi||Only 1 woman member in parliamentary panel that will examine Bill to raise legal age of marriage||The parliamentary panel assigned to examine the landmark Bill which seeks to raise the legal age of marriage for women to 21 has only one woman MP out of 31 members.The Prohibition of Child Marriage (Amendment) Bill, which will have wider influence over society especially females, was introduced in the Lok Sabha during the winter session and referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports.The Bill, piloted by the Women and Child Development Ministry, seeks to increase the legal age of marriage from 18 to 21.According to the members’ list of the parliamentary standing committee, led by senior BJP leader Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, available on the Rajya Sabha website, TMC MP Sushmita Dev is the only woman among the 31 members.When contacted, Dev said it would have been better if there were more women MPs in the panel.“I wish there were more women MPs in the committee but having said that we will make sure all interest groups are heard,” Dev told PTI.Echoing similar sentiments, NCP MP Supriya Sule, who has been raising women-centric issues in parliament, said there should have been more women MPs in the panel which will deliberate on issues related to women.However, she added that the chairman has the power to invite people before the panel. So for more inclusive and wider discussions, he can invite other women MPs.The Department-Related Standing Committees are permanent, while joint and select committees are constituted from time to time to deal with bills and relevant subjects of various ministries.These panels are constituted by both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth and Sports is a Rajya Sabha administered Committee.Parties nominate members based on their strength in the House.The proposed law will apply to all communities in the country and, once enacted, will supersede existing marriage and personal laws.The legal age of marriage for women is being raised by the Centre on the recommendations of the Jaya Jaitly Committee that was constituted by the WCD Ministry in June 2020.The introduction of the  Bill was opposed by some members who contended that the move infringed upon several personal laws in violation of fundamental rights and demanded that it be referred to a parliamentary panel for greater scrutiny.The bill seeks to increase the legal age for women to marry to 21 years, as is the provision for men.It seeks to amend seven personal laws — the Indian Christian Marriage Act; the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act; the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act; the Special Marriage Act; the Hindu Marriage Act; and the Foreign Marriage Act.

The canines were seen pulling her down on the road and biting her.A man then came to her rescue and chased away the dogs by hurling stones at them. The girl received wounds on her head and face.She has been admitted to the government-run Hamidia Hospital, police inspector Sanjeev Chouksey said, adding that they came to know about the incident through social media.A policeman was sent to the hospital to enquire about the girl’s identity and health. So far, no one has complained to the police about the incident, he said.“The girl is two to three years’ old. She is being given proper medical treatment. She is alright,” Bhopal Municipal Corporation Commissioner KVS Choudary told PTI.Denying that the stray dog menace has gone up in the state capital, he said the canine sterilisation programme was paused only for two-three months last year during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic.At least 30 to 40 dogs are being sterilised daily since over a month, he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/horror-caught-on-camera-pack-of-stray-dogs-mauls-3-year-old-girl-in-bhopal-357335
03-01-2022||New Delhi||GitHub user behind 'Bulli Bai' app blocked; IT minister says CERT, police coordinating further action||After photographs of at least 100 influential Muslim women were uploaded for auction on an app sparked widespread outrage, IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has said GitHub, the hosting platform, has confirmed blocking the user and that CERT and police authorities are coordinating further action.The uploading of pictures on the ‘Bulli Bai’ app was similar to the ‘Sulli Deals’ upload in July last year.The ‘Bulli Bai’ app worked just the same way as Sulli Deals did. Once opened, a Muslim woman’s face was randomly displayed as Bulli Bai. Muslim women with a strong presence on Twitter, including journalists, have been singled out and their photos uploaded.Two FIRs were filed by the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh Police in the Sulli Deals incident last year after photos of Muslim women were misused, but no concrete action has been taken against the perpetrators so far.Like ‘Bulli Bai’, the ‘Sulli Deals’ was also hosted on GitHub.Shiv Sena MP Priyanka Chaturvedi on Saturday flagged the ‘Bulli Bai’ app to Mumbai police as well as Vaishnaw for action, including the arrest of the culprits.In a tweet late on Saturday evening, Vaishnaw said, “GitHub confirmed blocking the user this morning itself. CERT and Police authorities are coordinating further action”.Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) is the nodal agency that deals with cyber security threats.He did not elaborate on the action being taken.Vaishnaw on Sunday tweeted: “Govt. of India is working with police organisations in Delhi and Mumbai on this matter”.The Union government had cited offending content against women as one of the reasons for framing the new digital rules that called for intermediaries for identifying the user hosting the offensive content within 24 hours.It isn’t clear if the same rules were used in ‘Sulli Deals’ and are being invoked in the case of ‘Bulli Bai’ to ask the hosting platform to identify the user for taking action.On Saturday, Chaturvedi had also tagged the IT minister, asking him to take stern action against such “rampant misogyny and communal targeting of women”.Those who flagged ‘Sulli Deal’ wanted Mumbai police, and not Delhi police, to take cognisance of the offence and take action. Some said they had little faith in Delhi police acting against the culprits.Delhi police work under the Union Home Ministry.“Have spoken to @CPMumbaiPolice and DCP Crime Rashmi Karandikar ji. They will investigate this. Have also spoken to @DGPMaharashtra for intervention. Hoping those behind such misogynistic and sexist sites are apprehended,” Chaturvedi had tweeted.“I have repeatedly asked Hon. IT Minister @AshwiniVaishnaw ji to take stern action against such rampant misogyny and communal targeting of women through #sullideals like platforms. A shame that it continues to be ignored,” Chaturvedi had tweeted on Saturday.Reacting to the development, Mumbai police said they have taken cognisance of the matter and that concerned officials have been asked to take action.Mumbai cyber police have initiated a probe in connection with the objectionable content, an official had said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/github-user-behind-bulli-bai-app-blocked-it-minister-says-cert-police-coordinating-further-action-357333
03-01-2022||New Delhi||Centre tells SC that it has decided to retain Rs 8 lakh income criterion for determining EWS||The Centre has told the Supreme Court that it has decided to accept the recommendation of a three-member panel to retain the current gross annual family income limit for Economically Weaker Section (EWS) of Rs 8 lakh or less.In its affidavit filed in a matter related to admissions for NEET-PG, the Centre said the panel has recommended that “only those families whose annual income is up to Rs 8 lakh would be eligible to get the benefit of EWS reservation”.“I respectfully submit that the central government has decided to accept the recommendations of the committee, including the recommendation of applying the new criteria prospectively,” R Subrahmanyam, Secretary, Department of Social Justice and Empowerment, who filed the affidavit on behalf of the Centre told the top court. The government had constituted the member committee, comprising Ajay Bhushan Pandey, former finance secretary, VK Malhotra, member secretary, ICSSR and Sanjeev Sanyal, Principal Economic Adviser to Centre, on November 30, last year as per the assurance given to the top court to revisit the criteria for determining the economically weaker sections.The committee in its report submitted on December 31 last year to the Centre said, “The current gross annual family income limit for EWS of Rs 8 lakh or less may be retained. In other words only those families whose annual income is up to Rs 8 lakh would be eligible to get the benefit of EWS reservation.”                 It said that the definition of ‘family’ and income would remain the same as those in the officer memorandum dated January 17, 2019. The panel recommended, “EWS may, however exclude, irrespective of income, a person whose family has 5 acres of agricultural land and above. The residential asset criteria may altogether be removed.”                  On the issue of applicability of criteria, the panel said that it has deliberated upon the vexed question as to from which year the criteria suggested in the report should be used, adopted and made applicable. The panel said it found that the existing criteria (the criteria applicable prior to this report) is in use since 2019 and the question of desirability of the existing criteria and a possibility of its being revisited arose only recently in the batch of petitions related to admissions in NEET-PG. “By the time this court started examining the said question and the central government decided to revisit the criteria by appointing this committee, the process with respect to some appointments/admissions have taken place or must have been at an irreversible and advanced stage. The existing system which is going on since 2019, if disturbed at the end or fag-end of the process would create more complications than expected both for the beneficiaries as well as for the authorities,” it said.The panel said in case of admissions to educational institutions, sudden adoption of new criteria inevitably and necessarily would delay the process by several months which would have an inevitable cascading effect on all future admissions and educational activities/teaching/examinations which are bound under various statutory or judicial time prescriptions.It said that changing the criteria midway is also bound to result in spate of litigations in courts across the country by the people whose eligibility would change suddenly.“The committee, therefore, after analysing the pros and cons on this issue and after giving serious consideration, recommends that the existing and ongoing criteria in every ongoing process where EWS reservation is available, be continued and the criteria recommended in this report may be made applicable from next advertisement/admission cycle,” it said.The panel recommended that data exchange and information technology should be used more actively to verify income and assets and to improve targeting for EWS reservations and also across government schemes.The apex court was hearing a batch of pleas filed by students challenging the Centre and Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) July 29, 2021 notices providing 27 per cent reservation for Other Backward Class (OBC) and 10 per cent for EWS category in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET-PG) admissions for medical courses for the current academic year.The top court had posted the matter for further hearing on January 6.On October 21, the top court had asked the Centre whether it would like to revisit the criteria for determining the EWS category for reservation in NEET-PG admissions. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-tells-sc-that-it-has-decided-to-retain-rs-8-lakh-income-criteria-for-determining-ews-357307
