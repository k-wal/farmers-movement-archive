Some Twitter handles and YouTube channel also disclosed the identity of victim which is prohibited by the law,” he said.The first FIR has been registered on the tweet posted by Sukhpreet Singh Slatch whose Twitter handle is @sukh_slatch, while the second FIR has been registered on the tweet of star whose Twitter handles is @StarKissan, the police said.According to the police, the FIRs have been registered under IPC sections of 153 (Wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 153 A (Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) among other relevant sections at the Vivek Vihar police station.The third FIR has been registered under section 228A (Whoever prints or publishes the name or any matter which may make known the identity of any person against whom an offence under section of rape and other) of the IPC against Madan Lal who posted a video in which he disclosed the identity of the victim and details of the incident on YouTube, the police officer said.On Monday, the police said legal action would be taken against those found revealing the identity and spreading rumours about the victim.The Delhi Police’s appeal came after several tweets were posted on social media platforms claiming that the victim had allegedly committed suicide. Some posts also allegedly revealed the identity of the victim.The police said that the geo-analysis of these posts revealed that such posts and tweets are being done from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh as well as from other countries like the US, Canada, UAE and UK in its bid to give a communal spin to the incident which is not the case.Both the victim and accused belongs to the same community but originally their forefathers are from Punjab, they said.Asking people not to reveal the identity of the victim and spread misleading facts, the police said necessary action is being taken by identifying those who have been spreading rumours.The police said they have arrested eight women and a man as well as apprehended three (boys) juveniles in connection with the Kasturba Nagar case. The accused were arrested on the basis of the victim’s complaint and the videos that surfaced online soon after the incident.Earlier in the day, Sathiyasundaram also took to Twitter and posted a video of himself urging people to not share rumours and false information through social media platforms.“In the Kasturba Nagar sexual assault case, some people are spreading rumours about the victim and the incident through social media platforms. False information is being posted. Some of them are also found revealing the identity of the victim and also trying to give a communal angle to the incident,” he said.“Some of them are spreading rumours that the victim has committed suicide. This is false information. The victim is doing fine and is safe. The officers of the team have also met her,” he added.He said if anyone is found spreading rumours or wrong information through social media or any other platforms, “we will surely take legal action against such people. Till now, whoever has shared such posts on the incident, we are taking legal action against them.” —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/gang-rape-case-3-booked-by-delhi-police-for-spreading-misinformation-365889

Now it’s planned to be released on OTT platform, ‘Limelight’ on January 30 – the day Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse.NCP leader and an MP from Shirur Lok Sabha constituency Amol Kolhe has played the role of Godse in the film. He recently clarified that he was a firm believer in Gandhian thoughts and he took up the controversial role only to challenge himself as an actor.Petitioner Sikandar Behl alleged that the film glorified Nathuram Godse and celebrated his act of killing Mahatma Gandhi. The movie intended to tarnish the image of the Father of the Nation and was aimed at creating communal disharmony, spreading hatred and disturbing peace, he alleged.Behl wanted the top court to issue directions for regulation of OTT platforms which were beyond the jurisdiction of the censor board as a result of which uncensored content was being broadcast.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-pil-against-release-of-why-i-killed-gandhi-on-ott-platform-365879

Alleging that Karhal and the adjoining region had been getting “step-motherly treatment” from the Samajwadi Party, Baghel said he will “get people justice and free them from gundas”.The Lok Sabha MP said he was fighting polls for development in the region and “will defeat” Akhilesh.Meanwhile, Akhilesh filed his nomination from Karhal, which is part of the Mainpuri Lok Sabha constituency. Calling it a “mission”, he said the UP election will “write the country’s history for the next century”.“Let us take part in this movement of positive politics with progressive thinking and defeat negative politics,” he said.                                     #UPElections2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttar-pradesh-bjp-fields-mos-law-sps-baghel-against-akhilesh-yadav-365873

The Government has not been forthcoming with the details,” Raman said in a statement.When contacted, Information and Broadcasting ministry officials confirmed that the channel has been banned but didn’t share any further details.Leader of Opposition in Kerala Assembly V D Satheesan said the I&B ministry banned the telecast without citing reasons.“The banning of telecast of MediaOne channel without citing any reason was undemocratic. This is against natural justice. The Union government has a responsibility to cite the reason behind the ban. The government is trying to implement the agenda of Sangh Parivar which has been intolerant against unpleasant truths,” he said.He said the ban amounts to attack on media freedom. MediaOne, along with another Malayalam News channel, Asianet, was briefly suspended for 48 hours over their coverage of communal violence in Delhi in 2020, with the official orders then saying they covered the Delhi violence in a manner that “highlighted the attack on places of worship and siding towards a particular community”.“Channel’s reporting on Delhi violence seems to be biased as it is deliberately focusing on the vandalism of CAA supporters,” the ministry order on Media One had said, adding, “it also questions RSS and alleges Delhi Police inaction.

31-01-2022||Vibha SharmaNew Delhi||Economic Survey: How the pandemic affected India's education system||The Covid pandemic affected lakhs of schools and colleges across India and has had a significant impact on the education system, the Economic Survey 2021-22 tabled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Parliament said on Monday.While it is difficult to gauge the real-time impact of repeated lockdown on the education sector because the latest available comprehensive official data dates back to 2019-20, the Survey says, the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2021, which has assessed the impact during the pandemic for education sector in rural areas, found that children (age 6-14 years) ‘not currently enrolled in schools’ increased from 2.5 per cent in 2018 to 4.6 per cent in 2021.Despite the pandemic enrolment in the age group of 15 to 16 years continued to improve as the number of “not enrolled” children in this age group declined from 12.1 per cent in 2018 to 6.6 per cent in 2021. However, the ASER report also found that during the pandemic, children (age 6-14 years) “not currently enrolled in schools” increased from 2.5 per cent in 2018 to 4.6 per cent in 2021, it said.“To identify out-of-school children, their mainstreaming, and research sharing, the Government has shared the Covid-19 action plan with States and UTs,” the government’s report card for the FY says.The ASER report also found that during the pandemic, children in rural areas moved out of private to government schools in all age groups.“The possible reasons suggested for the shift are shut down of low-cost private schools, financial distress of parents, free facilities in government schools and families migrating back to villages,” the survey says.While the availability of smartphones increased from 36.5 per cent in 2018 to 67.6 per cent in 2021, the ASER report says students in lower grades found it difficult to do online activities compared to higher grade students.“Nonavailability of smartphones for children to use and network of connectivity issues were the challenges faced by children," the survey said. “However, almost all enrolled children have been provided textbooks for their current grade (91.9 per cent). This proportion has increased over the last year, for children enrolled in both government and private schools.”Steps have been taken by the government to minimise the adverse impact of the pandemic on the education system to address the concern raised through private studies undertaken during the pandemic period, the survey adds.What data from pre-pandemic year 2019-20 reveals—Number of recognised schools and colleges continued to increase between 2018-19 and 2019-20, except for primary and upper primary school—2019-20 also saw a decline in drop-out rates at primary, upper primary and secondary levels. School dropout rate at primary level declined to 1.45 per cent from 4.45 per cent in 2018-19, both for boys and girls.—2019-20 saw an improvement in Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) at all levels and improvement in gender parity.—In 2019-20, 26.45 crore children were enrolled in schools. This has helped to reverse the declining trend of GER between 2016-17 and 2018-19.                                     #EconomicSurvey                                     #Education                                     #schools||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/education-how-the-pandemic-affected-indias-education-system-365868

Let it be listed in some other court next week.”Now Justice Lalit recused and consequently, the hearing will be done by a third bench.The top court is to hear the plea of Tejpal whose application for conducting an in-camera hearing of the proceedings under section 327 of the CrPC was rejected by the Goa bench of the Bombay High Court on November 24, last year.The acquittal of the former editor-in-chief of Tehelka magazine, who was accused of sexually assaulting his then-woman colleague in the lift of a five-star hotel in Goa in November 2013, by a sessions court in May 2021 was challenged in the Goa bench of the high court by the state government.Senior advocate Amit Desai, who had appeared for Tejpal, had referred to the Law Commission and various judgements of high courts supporting his application for an in-camera hearing.The high court, however, had rejected the submissions.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Goa government, had argued that the judgement (of acquittal of Tejpal) by the district court is in the public domain.“Section 327 applies for the purpose of inquiring into or trying any offence. It has limited application during inquiry or trial. The appeal is something very clear. Appeals, revisions, etc are neither investigation nor inquiry nor a trial,” he had said.In its order in May last year, the Mapusa district and sessions court had held that the complainant had not shown the “kind of normative behaviour” expected from a “victim of sexual assault”.The court had granted Tejpal the “benefit of the doubt” in the absence of corroborative evidence to support the allegations made by the complainant.Challenging Tejpal’s acquittal, the state government had said that the court’s judgement was “coloured by prejudice and patriarchy”.                                      #TarunTejpal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-judge-recuses-from-hearing-journalist-tarun-tejpals-plea-in-sexual-assault-case-365867

This is the importance of the mother in the Holy Quran. This was the message I used to tell all the misguided youths,” Lt Gen Dhillon had said.Lt Gen Dhillon came in the spotlight immediately after taking over as the Corps commander of the strategically located XV Corps when security forces eliminated Kamran alias ‘Ghazi’, mastermind of the February 2019 terror attack on CRPF personnel in Pulwama that left 40 jawans dead.“Kitne Ghazi aaye aur kitne gaye, hum yahin hain dekh lenge sabko (Many such terrorists have come and gone, we stand where we are rock solid),” were his comments during a press conference to announce the success.The statement, which went viral on social media with lakhs of hits recorded on YouTube and Twitter, was seen as a reflection of the Army’s resolve in fighting terrorism along the Line of Control as well as the hinterland.During his stint in Kashmir, which was the third in his career, Lt Gen Dhillon ensured a befitting reply to Pakistan which used unprovoked firing to provide cover to terrorists for infiltration.Lt Gen Dhillon had taken over the command at a crucial time when the Centre executed its plan of abrogation of the special status of the J-K and the state’s bifurcation into two union territories—Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir.After the successful completion of his tenure in Kashmir, Gen Dhillon took over as DG, DIA, an intelligence unit, created in 2002 on the recommendations of a Group of Ministers that looked into lapses leading to the Kargil intrusion in 1999.His posting at the DIA, which looks after the intelligence requirement of the armed forces, came at a time when the US-led allied troops were withdrawing from war-ravaged Afghanistan.He has been awarded several medals during his career which include Param Vishist Seva Medal and Uttam Yudh Seva Medal.Lt Gen Dhillon handed over the charge of DIA to Lt Gen GAV Reddy. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/operation-maa-author-in-kashmir-lt-gen-dhillon-hangs-up-his-boots-365862

When western UP was burning due to riots (Muzaffarnagar-2013), “those in power were celebrating”, he also added.“Five years ago, rioters, muscle men used to be law unto themselves in UP,” he said, pitching for “development-oriented and ‘gareeb ki sarkar;” of BJP’s Chief Minister Adityanath in contrast to the “nakli samajwad (fake socialism)” of the previous government. “Five years ago, there was news of the migration of people every other day. Abduction and demand for ransom had ruined the lives of the middle-class and traders.Traders were looted and daughters could not come out of their homes five years ago in the state,” he said.“I am glad that people are careful, they have decided to bring the BJP back to power with a bigger mandate. The people have made up their mind to give their blessings to BJP, especially the young and first-time voters. They will not back goondas,” he saidTaking a dig at Yadav’s initial remarks on Covid vaccines, PM Modi said: “Those who do not trust India’s own Covid vaccine, science and fuel rumours, can they respect the talent of UP’s youth?”“Those who betrayed poor were not even true to Chaudhary Charan Singh’s memory,” he said.The PM cited various schemes launched by the BJP-led Centre and the State, including homes for poor, policies for backward classes, medical colleges, greater connectivity through expressways, initiatives for Muslim women and the raising of marriage for women, to pitch for the Yogi Adityanath-led government.“These days, people dream a lot. Only those who keep sleeping, dream... Yogi Adityanath is awake, committed to work for UP’s development,”, he said in another jibe at Akhilesh.The PM said the previous government built “only 73 houses in Gautam Budh Nagar” during their tenure whereas the Adityanath government built “about 23,000 houses and gave them to the urban poor”.“Only 800 houses were built in Shamli, Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat cities by the Samajwadi government during its entire tenure,”, he said, adding that the BJP government has given houses to more than 33,000 poor people in these three cities.

31-01-2022||Vibha SharmaNew Delhi||Agriculture, allied sector resilient to Covid-19 shock: Economic Survey||The performance of the agriculture and the allied sector has been resilient to the Covid-19 shock, the Centre’s report card for 2021-22 said adding that the sector grew at 3.6 per cent in 2020-21 and improved to 3.9 per cent in 2021- 22.However, the Economic Survey tabled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Parliament on Monday also calls for focus to shift more towards harnessing the potential of allied activities and crop diversification towards oilseeds, pulses, and horticulture.“While the government has adopted the use of MSP as a signal to encourage crop diversification, there is also a need for coordinated action from the state governments to facilitate the shift to high value and less water consuming crops to enable the realisation of the objective of doubling farmers’ income in a sustainable way,” it says, adding that diversification “needs to be given priority by addressing the core issues of irrigation, investment, credit and markets in their cultivation”.Crop diversification can be used as a tool to promote sustainable agriculture, reduction in import dependence, and higher incomes for the farmers, it says, adding that shifting some areas from staple cereals to high-value produce can lead to a sizable increase in the returns for farmers.“This would also bring in water efficiency and sustainability of soil health. The existing cropping pattern is skewed towards the cultivation of sugarcane, paddy, and wheat which has led to the depletion of fresh groundwater resources at an alarming rate in many parts of our country,” it says.Regions, where the crops like paddy, wheat, and sugarcane are grown, have high to extremely high-stress levels include a majority of wheat, paddy, and cane growing areas, including Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh. The survey also points to the fact that fragmentation of landholdings has led to alternate sources such as livestock, fishery, and wage labour becoming significantly important for an agricultural household.“Increasing importance of allied sectors like animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries in growth and income of the farmers indicates that focus needs to shift more towards harnessing the potential of allied activities.“There is also a need to improve the productivity of small and marginal farmers through development and implementation of small holding farm technologies,” it adds.R&D can play a major role in realisation of sustainable agriculture practice that efficiently meets the objectives of nutritional security and improvement in farm income, it says adding that “every rupee spent on agricultural research and development, yields better returns compared to returns on money spent on subsidies or other expenditures on inputs”.“The increase in agriculture R & D therefore may improve productivity in the crop and allied sectors,” it says, calling for a need to explore options and promote use of alternative fertilisers like Nano Urea and organic fertiliser that protect the soil, are more productive and contribute to higher nutrient use efficiency.It also calls for focus on new technology including drones and AI-based decision support systems, reduction in use of chemical fertilizers and use of low-cost organic inputs, and supporting start-ups for innovations.Agriculture sector ‘experienced buoyant growth in the past two years’“The sector, which is the largest employer of the workforce, accounted for a sizeable 18.8 per cent (2021- 22) in Gross Value Added (GVA) of the country registering a growth of 3.6 per cent in 2020-21 and 3.9 per cent in 2021-22.“Growth in allied sectors including livestock, dairying, and fisheries has been the major drivers of overall growth in the sector. The agriculture and allied sectors grew at a positive growth rate of 3.6 per cent during 2020-21,” crediting it to “good monsoon and various government measures to enhance credit availability, improve investments, create market facilities, promote infrastructure development and increase the provision of quality inputs”.Output this year—During KMS 2020-21, 601.85 LMT rice was procured against an estimated target of 642.58 LMT.—In the KMS 2021-22, 566.58 LMT of paddy (equivalent to 379.98 LMT rice) was procured as on January 16 2022.—During RMS 2021-22, 433.44 LMT of wheat was procured against 389.92 LMT procured during RMS 2020-21.—During the Kharif and Rabi Marketing Season 2020-21, approx. 11.87 LMT coarse grains procured, highest in past five years||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agriculture-allied-sector-resilient-to-covid-19-shock-economic-survey-365852

With vaccination drive further extended to the age group of 15-18 years starting January 3, 2022, more than 50 per cent of India’s population in this age group have received their first dose of the vaccine as on January 19,” the survey said.Noting the resurgence in daily new cases since end-December 2021, marking the onset of Omicron variant induced third wave, the survey said rapid progress in vaccination coverage and further strengthening of testing and health infrastructure assumed critical importance in protecting lives and containing the spread of the infection.“The average daily vaccination rate has increased four-fold from 19.3 lakh in May 2021 to 75.4 lakh as of 16th January 2021,” it said a day after India completed two years of the detection of first Covid case and 75 per cent adults were fully jabbed.The Survey said that Covid vaccination has been an integral pillar of the comprehensive strategy of Government of India for containment and management of the pandemic.Tracing the history of the drive that started on 16th January 2021, the survey said India commenced the world’s largest vaccination programme with an ambitious target to inoculate its entire eligible population by December 31, 2021, with at least the first dose.In the first phase, the vaccination drive was sequentially expanded to cover healthcare workers and frontline workers. The second phase started on March 1, 2021 (for above 60 years) and April 1, 2021 (from 45-59 years) making all persons aged 45 years and above eligible for vaccination. This cohort had accounted for more than 80 per cent of the Covid-19 mortality in the country.The third phase began on May 1, 2021 to vaccinate people in the age group of 18-45 years.“From January 3, 2022, the vaccination drive has been further extended to include those in the age group of 15-18 years. Taking cognisance of the recent global surge of the Omicron variant, the Variant of Concern declared by WHO on 26th November 2021, booster doses to healthcare and frontline workers as well as senior citizens above 60 years of age with co-morbidities have been allowed by government from January 10, 2022,” the survey noted adding that vaccination access and pricing have been deregulated to quicken the pace of vaccination across states and all age groups.“The latest available data at the time of writing shows that 99 per cent of the registered healthcare workers and 100 per cent of the frontline workers, 87 per cent of the population aged between 18- 44 years, 95 per cent of the population aged between 45-60 years and 89 per cent of the population above 60 years have been covered under the first dose,” said the survey adding that vaccination drive continued to gather speed and breadth with the number of days taken to achieve an additional 10 crore doses reducing significantly from 86 days during the initial phase to 15 days now.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-vaccination-saved-lives-boosted-confidence-in-economy-post-2nd-wave-decline-economic-survey-365851

I had a handbag, a backpack, a sling bag and a black purse in which I had put all my jewellery worth Rs 36 lakh. At the screening point, a CISF woman constable asked me to show the purse and ornaments in it. I requested her to check it inside the purse and not take it out. I had put the ornaments in a transparent box. But she did not listen to me," she said.According to the FIR, the woman constable took out the ornament box and put it on another tray there.When she went to take her ornament box, the CISF constable took it back from her and put it into another tray."In the meantime, the airport announced the boarding time and I took my bag and went to board the flight. In the flight, I found the ornament box missing and I complained about the same to the flight attendant who advised me to report to CISF in New Delhi,"  she said.Bhatt further mentioned in the FIR that she had reported the matter to CISF in New Delhi and also to her husband. "The boarding for my flight for Dibrugarh was announced and so I was asked to board the flight and report the matter in Dibrugarh after reaching  there," she said.She said she reported the matter to CISF in Dibrugarh and made several calls to the airport officials to inform them about the incident."I was promised help in the matter but when I reached Lucknow on January 8, I was shown CCTV footage in which it was seen that the ornament box fell down from the scanning tray during the checking by the CISF officials," she said.The victim said the quality of the CCTV footage was very poor. "The camera was of very poor quality. No CCTV footage was available after the ornament box was seen falling down from scanning," she complained.She said she had a hunch that she was not shown the entire length of the CCTV footage or it was cut/ deleted deliberately or was not saved purposely.

We are not asking for any enforcement of FIR. This court has laid down preventive measures," the senior lawyer said."I will look into it and post before the appropriate bench immediately,"  the CJI said.Adeeb has filed a contempt plea seeking action against Haryana's chief secretary and the director general of police for “not complying with” the earlier judgment passed on Tehseen Poonawala's plea.There have been alleged incidents of disruptions in offering ‘namaz’ in open designated places in Gurugram.In 2018, the apex court issued guidelines to the Centre and states, asking them to take steps such as fast-tracking trials, victim compensation, deterrent punishment and disciplinary action against lax law-enforcing officials.One guideline said states shall designate a senior police officer not below the rank of police superintendent as the nodal officer in each district.

Interests of the small farmers, who constitute 80 per cent of the farmer community, have always been central to our government.”He mentioned PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi and direct cash transfer of Rs 1.8 crore to more than 11 crore farmer families as an investment and said over Rs 1 lakh crore had been given as compensation to eight crore farmers since crop insurance scheme changes were introduced.The government had earlier said that the now-repealed farm laws would hugely benefit small farmers. The President lauded farmers for over 30 crore tonnes of food grains and 33 crore tonnes of horticulture produce in 2020-21 and the government for matching record procurement.“The government procured 433 lakh metric tonnes of wheat during the rabi season benefiting about 50 lakh farmers. A record quantity of about 900 lakh metric tonnes of paddy was procured during kharif season, benefiting 1.3 crore farmers,” the President said, adding that agriculture exports had also reached a record level, rising more than 25 per cent in 2020-21 to nearly Rs 3 lakh crore.Presenting the government’s report card across sectors – potable water delivery to six crore rural households, construction of pucca houses, infrastructure among other things, the President said several major countries faced starvation during Covid, but in India a “sensitive government ensured that nobody remained hungry”.“The government is providing free ration to each poor household every month under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana. This is the world’s largest food distribution programme with an outlay of Rs 2.6 lakh crore reaching out to 80 crore beneficiaries for 19 months. Being fully sensitive to the present circumstances, the government has extended this scheme till March 2022,” the President said.He termed women’s empowerment one of the top priorities of the government saying, “Treating sons and daughters as equals, my government has also introduced a Bill to increase the minimum age of marriage for women from 18 to 21 on par with men.”The President also hailed criminalisation of triple talaq, end of restrictions on Muslim women who could earlier perform Haj only in male company and 4.5 crore scholarships to minority community students as against 3 crore prior to 2014.He noted as a matter of happiness that 33 Sainik Schools had started admitting girls and that the first batch of women cadets would enter the National Defence Academy in June 2022.On economy, the President said India had again emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the world and GST collection had consistently remained above Rs one lakh crore during the last several months.“Inflow of 48 billion dollars in the first seven months of the current financial year is a testimony to the belief the global investor community has in India’s growth story,” he said noting that India’s foreign exchange reserves exceed 630 billion dollars, and exports have broken several records.During April to December 2021, goods exports stood at 300 billion dollars or more than Rs 22 lakh crore, which is one and a half times more than the corresponding period of 2020, the President said, also speaking of India’s growing self reliance in defence and rising diplomatic heft in the world.                                     #budgetsession                                     #RamNathKovind||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-have-administered-150-crore-doses-of-covid-vaccine-in-record-time-president-kovind-in-address-to-parliament-365811

However, the case has not come up for hearing so far.The media report claiming India bought Pegasus spyware as part of a $2-billion defence deal with Israel in 2017 has triggered a major controversy with the Opposition alleging that the government indulged in illegal snooping that amounted to “treason”.The deal was not approved by Parliament and, therefore, needed to be cancelled and money be recovered, Sharma submitted.On October 27 last year, the SC had appointed a three-member panel of cyber experts to probe the alleged use of Pegasus for surveillance of certain people in India, saying that the state cannot get a “free pass” every time the spectre of national security is raised.‘Probe 2017 deal’Petition claims $2 bn defence deal with Israel in 2017 was not approved by Parliament                                     #Pegasus||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fresh-plea-filed-in-sc-on-pegasus-spyware-365634
31-01-2022||---||Supreme Court Judge bats for airing of hearings||New Delhi, January 30Maintaining that judges should be judged not only by the number of cases decided but also by their courtroom conduct, Supreme Court Judge DY Chandrachud has favoured public viewership of judicial proceedings, saying it would provide legitimacy to the judiciary.“Not only is it imperative that justice is done, but it should also seem to be done. Justice seems to be done only when judicial proceedings are opened for public viewership. This not only provides legitimacy to the judicial institution but also furthers the democratic principle of accountability,” Justice Chandrachud said at a virtual function to release “My Journey with Law and Justice”, a book by Prof Balram K Gupta.Adds to legitimacyThis (public viewership) not only provides legitimacy to the judicial institution but also furthers the democratic principle of accountability. — Justice DY Chandrachud“Though legal journalism is on the rise and reporting of judicial proceedings has gained traction, it has its own limitations. Unless judicial proceedings are open for public viewership, it would not be possible for the public to understand the nature of work undertaken by courts. Streaming of judicial proceedings is also a mode of education for law students, the young and the old of the Bar,” Justice Chandrachud noted.Almost three years after the Supreme Court agreed to live streaming of its proceedings, its e-committee led by Justice Chandrachud had in June last year come up with draft guidelines containing a regulatory framework for the purpose.The draft rules envisaged installation of cameras in the courtroom covering at least five angles, one towards the Bench, the second and third towards the advocates engaged in the concerned matter, the fourth towards the accused (where applicable) and the fifth towards the deponent/witness, as required.                                     #SupremeCourt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-judge-bats-for-airing-of-hearings-365637

On this emotional moment, many countrymen and the family of martyrs had tears in their eyes,” Modi said in his Mann Ki Baat radio broadcast on Sunday, the first this year.Paying tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his death anniversary, the PM referred to the installation of a digital sculpture of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at India Gate.He said his government has been honouring unsung heroes. In this context, he also mentioned Basanti Devi of Uttarakhand, who has been bestowed with Padma Shri for her contribution to environmental protection.PM Modi said that compassion for every living being was in our culture and innate nature. He said a glimpse of this was seen when the last rites of ‘Collarwali’ tigress from Madhya Pradesh were performed with respect and affection. He also said corruption hollows the country “like a termite” and all have to work together to rid the nation of it as soon as possible.Modi also said India was fighting the new wave of Covid with “great success” and asserted that the people’s trust on indigenous vaccines was “our strength”. “Till now, about 4.5 crore children have been administered the dose of Covid vaccine. This means that about 60 per cent of youth in the age group of 15 to 18 years have been jabbed within three to four weeks,” he said.In his radio broadcast, he also said Ladakh would soon have an impressive open synthetic track and Astroturf football stadium, which was being constructed at a height of more than 10,000 ft. “This will be the largest open stadium in Ladakh where 30,000 spectators can sit together.

The total indicative size of the proposed fund over the 2021-26 period is capped at Rs 2.38 lakh crore.VP, Speaker discuss Parliament arrangementsAhead of the Budget session of Parliament starting on Monday, Vice-President and Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla held a meeting at the Vice-President’s house to review the arrangements.

It completed two years of living with Covid with the first case detected on January 30, 2020. It also successfully inoculated 75 per cent of the adult population with both doses of Covid vaccines, enhancing protection against fast-emerging variants of the virus.As of Sunday, India had logged 4,10,92,522 cumulative Covid cases and 4,94,091 deaths with the Omicron dominating the Indian Sars-Cov2 landscape now and 75 per cent of all genome sequenced samples being of the Omicron lineage.The Health Ministry today said test-track-treat-vaccinate was the primary strategy to tackle Covid along with Covid-appropriate behaviour of social distancing, wearing of masks, and keeping hand and respiratory hygiene.Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said that although the Omicron wave had started to show early indications of plateau in some regions, cases and positivity was rising in other states.For instance, the daily new cases seen in India have remained nearly stable for three days (2,51,209 cases on Friday; 2,35,532 on Saturday; and 2,34,281 on Sunday), but the corresponding positivity rates which mirror the spread of infection have marginally risen over the last 24 hours.

But exception to Section 375 says sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, who is 15 or above, is not rape even if it is without her consent.But in October 2017, the SC had ruled that sex with one's minor wife would amount to rape. It watered down the exception to Section 375 which said sexual intercourse by a man with his wife not under the age of 15 would not amount to rape.Even as India dithers, more than 50 countries, including the US, the UK, Canada, France, Mauritius, Sri Lanka and Bhutan have already criminalised it.The Law Commission had, in 2000, opposed criminalising marital rape on the ground “that may amount to excessive interference with the marital relationship”. But Justice JS Verma Committee (2013) said, “The fact that the accused and victim are married or in another intimate relationship may not be regarded as a mitigating factor justifying lower sentences for rape.”After considering both reports, a parliamentary standing committee had said if marital rape was made a crime, the family system would be under stress and it could lead to practical difficulties.Sec 375 says...Section 375 of the IPC defines rape as sexual intercourse without consent and against the will of a woman. But exception to Section 375 says sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, who is 15 or above, is not rape even if it is without her consent.                                     #MaritalRape||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-criminalise-marital-rape-or-not-high-court-in-a-fix-365666

Despite a failed attempt to form a grouping with Pakistan and Malaysia, ties with ISI turned warmer and have gone beyond Kashmir to backing Islamist organisations in India.The report to NSC Secretariat speaks of three-pronged efforts by the Turkish government and related institutions — by media (employment to Kashmiri journalists); educational institutes (well-paying scholarships) and NGOs (influence Indian Muslims on foreign policy inimical to Indian interests).                                      #ISI                                     #Turkey||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/intel-report-turkey-hub-of-anti-india-operations-365670

BJP leaders, including Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, had been taking potshots claiming he SP chief was “afraid” of contesting Assembly election.While Akhilesh has patched up with his estranged uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav and announced an alliance with his Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia), observers say whether the party won or not, the SP chief “needed to be there in the Assembly post-poll to control the situation and keep his flock together.Karhal is seen as an SP stronghold and the BJP could field Akhilesh’s sister-in-law Aparna Yadav, who recently joined the saffron party.Meanwhile, the SP chief hit out at the BJP, saying the saffron party was one short of hitting a “century” of tickets given to candidates with a criminal history.In a tweet, the former Uttar Pradesh CM claimed the BJP had, so far, fielded 99 candidates with a criminal history for the upcoming Assembly polls in the state.                                     #AkhileshYadav                                     #samajwadiparty||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/akhilesh-to-file-papers-from-karhal-today-365677
31-01-2022||Satya PrakashNew Delhi||To criminalise or not—Delhi HC in a fix over marital rape||To criminalise or not — the Delhi High Court appears to be in a fix over the contentious marital rape.While hearing petitions filed by RIT Foundation and three others seeking to criminalise marital rape, a Bench led by Justice Rajiv Shakdher on Friday said the court can’t fold its hands and sit when people complain about a particular law.The petitioners have challenged the validity of an exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC on the ground that it discriminated against women raped by their husbands.Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code defines rape as sexual intercourse without consent and against the will of a woman. But exception to the Section 375 says sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, who is 15 or above, is not rape even if it is without her consent and against her will.But in October 2017, the SC ruled that sex with one’s minor wife would amount to rape. It watered down the exception to Section 375 IPC which said sexual intercourse by a man with his wife not under the age of 15 would not amount to rape.Even as India dithers, more than 50 countries, including the US, the UK, Canada, France, Mauritius, Sri Lanka and Bhutan, have already criminalised it.The Law Commission had in 2000 opposed criminalising marital rape on the ground “that may amount to excessive interference with the marital relationship”.But Justice JS Verma Committee (2013) said, “The fact that the accused and victim are married or in another intimate relationship may not be regarded as a mitigating factor justifying lower sentences for rape.”After considering both reports, a parliamentary standing committee had said if marital rape was made a crime, the family system will be under stress and it could lead to practical difficulties.The government maintained that the concept of marital rape, as understood internationally, can’t be suitably applied in the Indian context due to illiteracy, poverty, social customs and values, religious beliefs and mindset of the society to treat marriage as a sacrament.The Centre and men’s rights groups have cautioned the court against criminalising the bedroom conduct of married men by treating it on a par with a “sexual intercourse without consent and against the will of a woman” by a man rank stranger to her is fraught with serious consequences.It’s a complex issue touching upon law, society, culture, crime, society and public policy. Even if the court doesn’t simply declare marital rape amounts to rape, it will have to find a way out to deal with one of the worst open secrets of Indian society.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-criminalise-or-not%E2%80%94delhi-hc-in-a-fix-over-marital-rape-365600
31-01-2022||---||Pegasus issue to storm Budget Session, starting on Monday||New Delhi, January 30The Pegasus spyware issue is set to storm the Budget Session of Parliament starting Monday with the opposition Congress drawing battle lines on session eve itself.Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury today wrote to Speaker Om Birla seeking to move a privilege motion against IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw accusing him of “misleading the Parliament on the issue”.The letter cites fresh claims by the New York Times about India purchasing Pegasus spyware from Israel as part of a defence deal earlier and says, “It appears that the government misled Parliament and the Supreme Court and lied to the people of India. I demand that a privilege motion may be initiated against the Minister of Information Technology for deliberately misleading the House on the Pegasus issue.”On July 19, 2021, Vaishnaw had dismissed the allegations over Pegasus and said, “The timing is not a coincidence. When we look at this issue through the prism of logic, it clearly emerges that there is no substance behind this sensationalism.” The Monsoon session last year had been washed out over Pegasus.Chowdhury also alleged today that the government lied to SC when asked if it had purchased or deployed Pegasus.“In a sworn affidavit, the government denied any and all of the allegations on the Pegasus issue,” said the Congress leader with the opposition expected to raise privatization of public assets, LAC standoff, lack of jobs and farmer distress among other issues.The Budget Session commences tomorrow with the address of President Ram Nath Kovind to both houses of Parliament followed by the tabling of the Economic Survey by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Lok Sabha.The FM will present the union budget on February 1.The session will end on April 8, and will have two parts. In all, there will be 29 sittings – 10 in the first part and 19 in the second.The first segment of the Session will end on February 11 to allow recess from February 12 to March 13 when parliamentary committees will examine allocations to various ministries and give reports.The first half of the Session will have two major items of business—discussion on the Motion of Thanks on President’s Address and general discussion on Budget.The Government has fixed four days – February 2 to 7 -- for discussion on the President’s address.Importantly, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha will sit in shifts due to Covid restrictions and from Wednesday, Lok Sabha will sit from 4 pm to 9 pm and Rajya Sabha in the morning.“Five hours have been scheduled per sitting during the first part of the Budget Session. MPs will be accommodated in Lok Sabha Chamber and its galleries during this time. During the first part of the Session after presentation of the Budget, 40 hours of normal time will be available for various businesses including Question Hour, Private Members’ Business, Discussion on Motion of Thanks and General Discussion on the Union Budget,” said Parliament sources.In view of Covid-19 pandemic and the need for social distancing, MPs will be allotted seats in Lok Sabha Chamber (282), Lok Sabha galleries 148 (except the media gallery), Rajya Sabha Chamber (60) and Rajya Sabha Gallery (51).                                     #budgetsession                                     #Pegasus||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-issue-to-storm-budget-session-starting-on-monday-365599
31-01-2022||New Delhi||Vistara cancels, reschedules several Feb flights; passengers complain||Vistara has cancelled and rescheduled a significant number of its February flights during the last few days, aviation industry sources said on Sunday.Moreover, during the last few days, a considerable number of affected passengers have stated on social media that they have been facing difficulties in contacting Vistara’s customer care.Vistara spokesperson, however, told PTI that the airline is adjusting “capacity to demand” in view of the “volatility” in the Indian aviation market due to the current Covid-19 wave and resultant restrictions imposed by the state governments.ISRO Scientist Shibasish Prusty tweeted on Sunday that his Delhi-Bhubaneswar flight for February 5 has been cancelled and Vistara’s customer care number is a “cheap gimmick” as it has been busy for the last 48 hours.Another passenger Arpit Singh Khurana said on Saturday on Twitter that his Delhi-Kolkata flight for February 12 has been cancelled by Vistara and his calls to the customer service number are going unattended.Pronab Kumar Mandal said on Saturday that he is a cancer patient and he needs to have his chemotherapy session on February 9, but Vistara has cancelled his Kolkata-Mumbai flight, scheduled for February 8.Mandal said he has been trying to contact the airline for the last two days.A passenger named Mohammed Dawood said on Saturday that his Delhi-Kolkata flight for February 10 has been cancelled and he has not been provided with the option to reschedule.“Now, fare cost is double and your customer service is extremely unhelpful, even the call doesn’t get connected,” he told Vistara.On Sunday afternoon, he tweeted that he has been trying to reach the airline through calls, tweets and emails, but there has been no response.A passenger named Sanjit Kumar Das said on Sunday afternoon that his Bhubaneswar-Delhi flight has been cancelled and he has been trying to connect with Vistara’s customer service “without any luck”.A similar set of complaints were posted on Twitter by the airline’s passengers whose flights have been rescheduled without prior discussion.In response to PTI’s queries regarding the rescheduling and cancellation of February flights, Vistara spokesperson told PTI, “After a sharp decline in demand for air travel, due to the surge in Covid-19 numbers and restrictions imposed by various state governments, we are observing a marginal increase in traffic in February compared to the previous month.”“However, in view of the volatility, we continue to closely monitor the situation and adjust capacity to demand,” the spokesperson added.With the objective of minimising inconvenience to our customers, the airline is offering waiver of change fee for one-time rescheduling on all direct bookings with travel until March 31, the spokesperson mentioned.Direct bookings are tickets that are booked directly with the airline and they do not include the ones booked through agent websites such as MakeMyTrip, Yatra, Cleartrip etc.The spokesperson stated, “We are also assisting the impacted customers with rescheduling, refunds etc., as applicable. We have also advised and empowered our travel agent partners to extend support to customers, as and when required.” —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vistara-cancels-reschedules-several-feb-flights-passengers-complain-365579
31-01-2022||Bhopal/Gwalior||Hindu Mahasabha pays tribute to Nathuram Godse, confers 'Bharat Ratna' on Kalicharan held for remarks against Mahatma Gandhi||On a day the nation observed Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary, the Hindu Mahasabha on Sunday paid tribute to his assassin Nathuram Godse and a co-accused in the Gandhi murder trial, Narayan Apte, in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior by observing “Godse-Apte Smriti Diwas”.The right-wing organisation also bestowed “Godse-Apte Bharat Ratna” in Gwalior upon jailed religious leader Kalicharan Maharaj, who was arrested last December for allegedly making derogatory remarks against the Mahatma during a Dharma Sansad held in Chhattisgarh capital Raipur, and four leaders of the Mahasabha.“We performed ‘aarti’ of Bharat Mata with a resolve to integrate India with Pakistan to make it ‘Akhand Bharat’. We are observing January 30 as the ‘Godse Apte Smriti Diwas’ day to express our anger over their arrest on January 30, 1948,” Hindu Mahasabha’s national vice president Jaiveer Bharadwaj told PTI over the phone from Gwalior.The country on Sunday paid tribute to the Father of the Nation on his 74th death anniversary.Bharadwaj said the Mahasabha has honoured Kalicharan Maharaj and four leaders of Hindu Mahasabha with the “Godse-Apte Bharat Ratna” in Gwalior.“Since Kalicharan Maharaj is in jail, the honour was received by Pramod Lohpatre on his behalf,” Bharadwaj said.He blamed Mahatma Gandhi for the partition of India in 1947, which he said led to the killing and displacement of lakhs of Hindus.Talking to reporters after attending the programme in Mahasabha’s office in the Daulatganj area of Gwalior, Bharadwaj claimed the Hindu Mahasabha had made a huge contribution to the freedom struggle.“People should not be misled into believing that India got independence due to charkha (spinning wheel popularised by Mahatma Gandhi),” he said.Bharadwaj alleged that Congress and BJP didn’t inform the people about the sacrifice made by seers and “seven lakh people who lost their lives during the freedom struggle”.Mahasabha pays tribute and respects all the revolutionaries, he added.Last November, the Hindu Mahasabha had said it will sculpt a statue of Nathuram Godse using the soil brought from Haryana’s Ambala Central Jail, where he was hanged to death in 1949.In November 2017, Gwalior district authorities had confiscated Godse’s bust foiling the right-wing outfit’s attempt to turn its office into a ‘temple’ of Godse.When asked about the Mahasabha honouring Kalicharan and others with “Godse Apte Bharat Ratna”, Madhya Pradesh BJP president VD Sharma said that it was the incumbent BJP government at the Centre which has taken Mahatma Gandhi’s work to the people.“There is a process of providing ‘Bharat Ratna’ (the highest civilian honour in India) by the Centre. It can’t be given to anybody standing on the road,” he said, adding that there is freedom of expression in the country.On January 19, Thane police in Maharashtra arrested Kalicharan from Chhattisgarh in connection with a case registered against him in Thane for allegedly making derogatory remarks against Mahatma Gandhi. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hindu-mahasabha-pays-tribute-to-nathuram-godse-confers-bharat-ratna-on-kalicharan-held-for-remarks-against-mahatma-gandhi-365576
31-01-2022||Noida||Rakesh Tikait slams govt, says farmers would observe 'Betrayal Day' on Monday||Alleging betrayal by the Centre, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Sunday announced a country-wide observance of “Betrayal Day” on Monday over farm issues.The national spokesperson of the influential north Indian farmers’ union claimed the over-a-year-long protest at Delhi’s borders was withdrawn on the basis of a letter of promises by the government on December 9 but those remain unfulfilled.“A nation-wide ‘Betrayal Day’ will be observed on January 31 because of government’s betrayal to farmers. The movement was suspended on the basis of a letter given by the government on December 9 but those promises have not been fulfilled,” Tikait, whose BKU is a part of the SKM, said in a tweet in Hindi.The protest on Delhi’s borders had started under the banner of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a farmers’ collective, in November 2020 over the main demands of withdrawal of three contentious farm laws that were introduced by the BJP-led Centre.The farmers, who occupied key border points of Singhu , Tikri and Ghazipur for over a year, also demanded a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) of crops.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in November 2021 announced that the contentious farm laws would be rolled back, leading to the protestors eventually vacating Delhi borders in December.                                      #FarmersProtest||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rakesh-tikait-slams-govt-says-farmers-would-observe-betrayal-day-on-monday-365575
31-01-2022||Jerusalem||Pegasus row: Undeterred NSO says criticisms 'hypocritical', blacklisting by US will be rescinded||Israel’s embattled cyber tech company NSO Group has denied wrongdoing as it called criticism of its sale of Pegasus spyware programme to non-democratic countries “hypocritical”, comparing the surveillance technology to military weapons systems being sold by others, amid mounting allegations that software was misused globally, including in Israel.An undeterred Chief Executive Officer of NSO Group, Shalev Hulio, in an interview to Israeli Channel 12 on Saturday, strongly defended the company’s operations, though he also conceded that some “mistakes” may have happened over the years.“I absolutely sleep soundly at night,” Hulio told the Channel’s interviewer when asked if he can do so amid so much worldwide criticism.Hulio’s interview came a day after a New York Times report on Friday claimed that India bought Pegasus spyware as part of a USD 2 billion defence deal with Israel in 2017, triggering a major controversy with the Opposition alleging that the government indulged in illegal snooping that amounted to “treason”.“There is not one country we’ve sold to, not one… that the US does not sell to, or that Israel doesn’t sell to. So it’s a bit hypocritical to say it’s okay to sell F-35s and tanks and drones, but it’s not okay to sell a tool that collects intelligence,” Hulio said, defending the company’s position.He also pointed out that out of almost 90 clients that turned to them for the technology, they sold only to around 40 as per laid down norms.In reaction to the blacklisting of the company by the US Department of Commerce in November, the company’s senior most executive called it an “outrage” that he hopes will be lifted soon.“Our technology has over the years helped the interests and national security of the United States quite a bit,” he claimed. “I think the fact that a company like NSO is on [a US blacklist] is an outrage… I’m sure we’ll be taken off that list. I have no doubt.”The NSO Group and its controversial Pegasus technology, which has grabbed attention of governments and people worldwide with allegations of misuse in India as well, was blacklisted by the US Department of Commerce for acting “contrary to the foreign policy and national security interests of the US” last year in November.Israel distanced itself from the controversy triggered by the blacklisting of the NSO Group after allegations of illegal use of its Pegasus spyware to target government officials, activists and journalists globally, saying it is a private company and it has nothing to do with the policies of the Israeli government.In India, a row had erupted last year over Pegasus allegedly being used for targeted surveillance in India. An international investigative consortium had claimed that many Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were potentially targeted by the software.The Indian government, however, had dismissed allegations of any kind of surveillance on its part on specific people.Last October, the Indian Supreme Court set up a three-member independent expert panel to probe the alleged use of Pegasus for targeted surveillance in India, observing the state cannot get a “free pass” every time the spectre of national security is raised and that its mere invocation cannot render the judiciary a “mute spectator” and be the bugbear it shies away from.In his interview, Hulio also denied that Pegasus was used to hack the phone of French President Emmanuel Macron. He also denied any link between the company’s products and the killing of dissent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Gulf Kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.“It’s become something of a national pastime to blame anything that happens on NSO. A large part of the reports are simply untrue, are prejudiced, and it certainly sometimes angers [me] and sometimes frustrates. But in the end… we know the truth,” the CEO asserted.When asked if the NSO Group has made mistakes since its establishment, he said that “over a period of 12 years it’s impossible not to make mistakes, which you learn from”, without sharing any details.However, he also justified the presence of such a technology that can help prevent acts of terror and other serious crimes.On the recent reports that the Israel Police used Pegasus to spy on civilians, including anti-Benjamin Netanyahu protesters and Israelis not suspected of any crimes, his answer was that he would like to think that they are untrue.“I, as a citizen, if the things that were written are true, it worries me personally. But as a citizen, I tell you I choose to believe the attorney general, the public security minister and the police chief who say time and again these things never happened,” Hulio responded.With controversies surrounding the company refusing to die down, Israeli Attorney Genera Avichai Mendelbit in January announced to set up a team to probe into alleged misuse of the snooping Pegasus technology by the Israeli police against its own citizens, including those not suspected of crime.Israel established a committee in July last year to review the allegations of misuse of the NSO group’s surveillance software and hinted at a possible “review of the whole matter of giving licences”.Hulio, had welcomed the move, saying they would “be very pleased if there were an investigation so that we’d be able to clear our name”.He had also claimed that there was an effort “to smear the whole Israeli cyber industry”.The NSO executive had also emphasised that his company could not disclose the details of its contracts due to “issues of confidentiality,” but, “he would offer full transparency to any government seeking more details”.“Let any state entity come along, any official from any state, and I’ll be prepared to open everything up to them, for them to enter, to dig around from top to bottom,” Hulio then said.Israel’s defence ministry had in a statement also threatened that if it finds that the NSO Group violated the terms of its export licenses, it will “take appropriate action”.                                     #Pegasus||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/pegasus-row-undeterred-nso-says-criticisms-hypocritical-blacklisting-by-us-will-be-rescinded-365572

The allegation that he was forced to drink urine is yet to be established,” investigating officer and Ratangarh circle officer Himanshu Sharma said.While two of the accused Umesh and Birbal have been arrested, the others Akshay, Rajesh, Rakesh, Tarachand, Bidadichand and Dinesh are absconding, he said.They have been booked under Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 365 (abduction) and 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt, or restraint) of the Indian Penal Code and under the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the officer said, adding that the vehicle used in the crime has been recovered.According to Meghwal, he was playing a local musical instrument called Chang on Holi during which the accused had passed nasty comments, leading to a confrontation between them for the first time.                                     #crimesagainstDalits||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eight-booked-for-forcing-dalit-man-to-consume-urine-in-rajasthans-churu-2-held-365547
