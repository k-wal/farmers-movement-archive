Searches at this premises are still on, sources said.Those arrested are Gaur, Kumar, Nair, Gupta and Bansal.“Subsequent, searches were conducted at the premises of accused at Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon, Panchkula, Karnal etc, which led to recovery of Rs.84 lakh(approx), so far which include recovery of Rs 75 lakh from Gurgaon based private person. Searches are continuing at the premises of public servant,” Joshi said.It is alleged that Ranganathan was “indulging into corrupt and illegal activities in criminal conspiracy” with Gaur and Kumar who is also director of Rishab Polychem Pvt. Ltd based at Bahudargarh Road, Delhi.Kumar and Gaur allegedly acted as Ranganathan’s middlemen, by obtaining bribe from the private companies buying petro chemical products marketed by the GAIL, the FIR alleged.It said sources informed the CBI that at the direction of Kumar, Gaur had asked Ranganathan for allowing some discount to the buyers on petro chemical products being marketed by GAIL in return of illegal gratification.It is alleged that Kumar and Gaur met Ranganathan at his Noida residence on December 11 last year for discussing the proposal, the FIR alleged.Two days later Gaur informed Kumar that proposal of discounts is being considered in GAIL, the FIR alleged.In order to arrange bribes, Kumar got in touch with other prospective beneficiaries of discount, after the final decision is taken in GAIL on issuance of the discount order. Gaur, Kumar and Ranganathan again met at a five star hotel in Delhi on December 14 to discuss it further.“Source has further informed that on December 17, 2021, Rajesh collected the demanded bribe amount from beneficiary private parties and delivered it to Gaur for Ranganathan. Source has further informed that on December 18, 2021, on the direction of Ranganathan, Nair...has collected the said amount of Rs. 40 Lakh from the residence of Gaur. Thereafter on December 20, 2021, Gaur pursued Ranganathan for issuance of order, on which he had told him that he would sign after returning from Mumbai,” an official said.Kumar allegedly roped in two more perspective beneficiaries—Gupta and Bansal—and convinced them for paying bribe in exchange for the favourable orders, the FIR alleged.Kumar on January 13, told Gupta to fulfil his side commitment for issuance of discount order from GAIL and put forth alleged demand of Rs 12 lakh from Ranganathan, it alleged.Gaur also told Gupta to send money at the earliest after which he allegedly paid Rs three lakh to Kumar while remaining was to be sent through hawala route, it said.“...Ranganathan on the request of Pawan Gaur and Rajesh Kumar got some checks conducted in the month of November, 2021 in the premises of some authorised stockists of GAIL. However, before the said surprise check, Sh. E.S. Ranganathan had also cautioned some of his favoured parties,” the FIR alleged.The CBI has booked the accused under IPC sections of criminal conspiracy and provisions of Prevention of Corruption Act, they said.                                      #bribery                                     #CBI                                     #GAIL                                     #Maharatna                                     #petrochemical||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-books-gail-director-in-alleged-bribery-case-arrests-5-361573
15-01-2022||New Delhi||Army Day: Gen Naravane releases stamp commemorating permanent commission to women officers||Army Chief General M M Naravane on Saturday released a postage stamp commemorating permanent commission to women officers in the Indian Army.The Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling in February 2020, had directed the Centre to ensure that women short service commission (SSC) officers are given permanent commission (PC) in the Indian Army, including command postings.The Army said on Saturday tweeted, “On the occasion of Army Day, General M M Naravane, Chief of Army Staff, eleased a commemorative postage stamp, ‘Permanent Commission to Women Officers in the Indian Army’.” After the SC ruling, the Army had constituted a special selection board in September, 2020 to screen women officers. The results were declared in November, 2020.The women officers who were not granted PC moved the apex court. In March, 2021, the court found that the “evaluation criteria set by the Army constituted systemic discrimination” against these women officers.The top court, in its March 2021 order, laid down revised parameters on the basis of which the women officers were evaluated for permanent commission in the Army.Thereafter, in July, 2021, a total of 147 additional women SSC officers of the Indian Army were granted permanent commission according to the revised parameters set by the Supreme Court.                                      #ArmyChief                                     #IndianArmy                                     #Naravane                                     #permanentcommission                                     #postagestamp                                     #womeninarmy||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-day-gen-naravane-releases-stamp-commemorating-permanent-commission-to-women-officers-361572
15-01-2022||Sandeep DikshitNew Delhi||India to top up $ 900 million aid for Sri Lanka with $1.5 billion bail-out package||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday held talks with Sri Lankan Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa and discussed joint projects and investments by Indian companies that would strengthen the economy of the island nation.Jaishankar was holding the conversation with a Minister who was not strictly his counterpart a couple of days after India bailed out Sri Lanka temporarily from its balance of payments difficulties. The help extended by India is worth over $ 900 million and about $ 1.5 billion more is in the pipeline, said sources. Sri Lanka’s economic position can be gauged from the fact that shortly after his Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit to Colombo, China is sending a shipment of sugar.During the virtual meeting, Jaishankar also raised the issue of Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan custody and urged for their early release as a humanitarian gesture while reaffirming that “India will be a steadfast and reliable partner of Sri Lanka’’.“We positively noted the extension of the $ 400 million swap facility and the deferred ACU settlement of $ 515.2 million (by two months). Discussed the early realisation of 1 billion term loan facility for essential commodities and of 500 million LoC for fuel purchase,” the external affairs minister said.The two ministers also reviewed the progress in extending the Indian credit facility of $ 1 billion for importing food, essential items, and medicine and $ 500 million for importing fuel from India.During the meeting, Rajapaksa recalled India’s long-standing cooperation with Sri Lanka and deeply appreciated the gestures of support.He welcomed Indian investments in Sri Lanka in a number of important spheres including ports, infrastructure, energy, renewable energy, power and manufacturing and assured that a conducive environment will be provided to encourage such investments.“The west terminal [at Colombo port] and the tank farm are two very important transactions (with India). As I see it, the two sides should move seamlessly into the strategic area,’’ Sri Lanka’s High Commissioner Asoka Milinda Moragoda during a virtual address to students of the Gandhinagar-based Rashtriya Raksha University.“Of course, given the nature of the power play in this region, Chinese presence can be looked at differently. In that context, I think our dialogue with India is what is important – to build trust and to understand each other. And, maybe, have some sort of red lines which both sides will not cross,” Moragona said. China does not have any security presence in Sri Lanka, and India has never told the island nation not to accept Chinese investment, he added.“For us, Trincomalee could potentially be a petroleum hub for India, both for storage and refining. Trincomalee can only service India, it is too far away from sea lanes...We need to think strategically and that’s going to be the next step. Looking at this narrowly as a tank farm transaction would be wrong,” he said.Just concluded a detailed virtual meeting with Sri Lankan Finance Minister @RealBRajapaksa.Reaffirmed that India will be a steadfast and reliable partner of Sri Lanka. pic.twitter.com/aYgKEpkSFy                                     #aid                                     #bailout                                     #India                                     #Srilanka||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-top-up-900-million-aid-for-sri-lanka-with-1-5-billion-bail-out-package-361569

15-01-2022||Mumbai||Maha ATS lawyers to track Malegaon-2008 blast case hearing||Alarmed by witnesses turning hostile in the Malegaon-2008 blasts case, the Maharashtra government lawyers shall now remain in the Special NIA Court where the trial is being conducted on a daily basis, Home Minister Dilip Walse-Patil said here on Saturday.He told the media persons that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had taken over the case (from the state ATS), but the state government is perturbed at the manner in which several critical witnesses have become hostile in the Special Court.The significant development came two days after the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ally Congress had raised the issue and drawn the attention of the Home Ministry and the ATS.Congress state Working President M. Arif Naseem Khan had submitted a memorandum to the Additional Director-General of Police and ATS chief Vineet Agrawal urging necessary measures to monitor the case closely."We are thankful to Home Minister Walse-Patil for accepting our demand for a team to keep a track on the court proceedings. The presence of the ATS lawyers will help in a free and fair trial," Khan said in a statement.An ex-minister, Khan reiterated that the NIA is allegedly 'weakening' the Malegaon-2008 case and not pursuing it with 'honesty and sincerity'.In his memorandum to the ATS Chief Agrawal, Khan contended that the witnesses turning hostile are invoking the names of Bharatiya Janata Party-RSS leaders to "malign the Maharashtra government and ATS" for gaining political mileage in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh elections.The September 29, 2008 (Malegaon 2008) bomb blast was allegedly engineered in this minority-dominated Nashik town by Hindu fundamentalists, killing 6 and injuring over 100 others, during the Ramadan month when Muslims were breaking their fast.The Maharashtra Police and then the ATS probed the case till 2011 when it was taken over by the NIA, and the trial is going on daily before the Special NIA Court in Mumbai.Of the 223 witnesses examined, 16 have turned hostile, claiming that the ATS tortured them to give evidence against the accused, said Khan, urging the need for the presence of the ATS in the court to protect the image of the Maharashtra government.Among the accused in the sensational Malegaon 2008 case are BJP MP Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, Swami Amritananda Dev Teerth, Dayanand Pandey, Lt. Col. Prasad S. Purohit, and others.Khan said that the ATS was being sought to be tarnished as an 'anti-Hindu' agency with the witnesses, allegedly influenced by the accused, deliberately naming BJP-RSS people ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls for political gains."The NIA is not prosecuting all the accused with honesty and sincerity. Out of 223 witnesses who deposed so far, 16 important ones have turned hostile and over a 100 more are still left to be examined. These witnesses are crucial and need to be protected. The NIA has not challenged any orders passed in favour of the accused which shows their intentions clearly," Khan said.Some of the witnesses in Malegaon 2008 case even went beyond their recorded statement mentioning names like Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, but the NIA's Special Public Prosecutor took no objection, and another witness claimed he was tortured and threatened by the ATS to take names of Yogi and 4 RSS leaders.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maha-ats-lawyers-to-track-malegaon-2008-blast-case-hearing-361558

15-01-2022||New Delhi||AAP’s claim stands vindicated: Raghav Chadha after EC relaxes norms for registration of parties||A day after the EC reduced the period for registration of new political parties, the AAP on Saturday said its claim stood vindicated and accused the poll panel of relaxing the norms in the middle of the elections to damage the poll prospects of the Arvind Kejriwal-led party in Punjab “under a conspiracy”.The AAP had on Thursday claimed that the Election Commission (EC) was going to register a new political party by bringing changes in its rules at the behest of the BJP in the middle of elections to stop the party from winning assembly polls in Punjab and forming its government in the state, an allegation the poll panel later dismissed, terming it “factually incorrect”.Addressing a press conference at the party’s headquarters here on Saturday, AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha asked the EC and the BJP to disclose the name of the “political morcha” for which the rules were changed “overnight”.The AAP leader, however, refused to name the political party in question, saying it will soon be known to everybody.The EC on Friday announced the reduction of notice period for registration of new political parties in the five poll-going states from 30 days to 7 days, keeping in view difficulties caused by Covid-19-induced curbs.“The Election Commission of India came with a circular on January 14 saying that it has reduced the 30-day notice period to 7 days in view of the political parties facing some difficulties in submitting their registration form and completing other formalities due to Covid-19 pandemic,” Chadha told reporters on Saturday.“With this, the AAP’s prediction, apprehension, suspicion, information has turned into belief,” the AAP leader said, terming the Commission’s notification “documentary evidence” of the claims that AAP had made in this on Thursday.Raising objections to the Election Commission’s decision, Chadha, who is co-in charge of the AAP’s political affairs in Punjab, alleged that the EC has brought in changes in its rules to register a new political party “under a conspiracy” to defeat “the AAP and Arvind Kejriwal’s honest politics” in the assembly polls.“Under a big conspiracy, a new political party is being registered, perhaps to cut the votes of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)... This is our apprehension. It is bothering us,” he said He asked both the poll panel and the BJP to disclose the name of the party for whose registration the rules were relaxed “overnight”.“Who are those political people, political forces who want to see AAP defeated at any cost? I want to ask both the Election Commission and the BJP... People have the right to know in democracy. The Election Commission going to register a new party overnight so that it cuts the AAP’s votes,” he said.Replying to a question on whether the party now plans any legal course of action against the poll panel’s decision, Chadha said that the AAP will take the issue to the people’s court, instead of approaching the court of law.The AAP leader claimed that the EC “never” registered a new political party by bringing changes in its rules “in the middle of elections and after the announcement of the dates of polls”.However, the EC in its statement on Thursday had said that it relaxed the notice period in view of the pandemic during the assembly polls in Bihar, Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.Noting that it had recently announced the schedule for assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Punjab and Manipur on January 8, the poll panel said, “It has been brought to the notice of the commission that in view of prevailing restrictions on account of Covid-19, there was dislocation and delay in moving applications for registration, which in turn led to delay in registration as a political party.”After considering all aspects, the commission has given a relaxation and has reduced the notice period from 30 days to seven days for the parties which have published their public notice on or before January 8.“For all parties, including those parties which have already published the public notice in less than 7 days prior to January 8, objection, if any, can be submitted latest by 5.30 pm on January 21, or by the end of the originally provided 30 days period, whichever is earlier,” the statement added.                                     #AAP                                     #assemblypolls                                     #ElectionCommission                                     #NewParty                                     #Punjabpolls2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aaps-claim-stands-vindicated-raghav-chadha-after-ec-relaxes-norms-for-registration-of-parties-361545

15-01-2022|| New Delhi||'Damage control': In first list, BJP gives tickets to 44 OBC candidates in UP||In an attempt to control the damage caused by exodus of leaders like Swami Prasad Maurya and others, the BJP has given majority representation to the OBCs in its first list of candidates for the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.Of 107 candidates announced on Saturday, 44 comes from OBC communities.Several OBC leaders including Maurya, Dara Singh Chauhan, Dharam Singh Saini and others resigned from BJP in the last few days.BJP names 107 candidates for UP election; Yogi Adityanath to contest from GorakhpurA saffron party leader said that extent of damage caused by exit of Swami Prasad Maurya and other OBC leaders is still to be accessed but the list shows that the party tried to keep the backward communities in good faith by giving almost half of the tickets to OBC candidates in the first list."Polls results will show the real impact of the recent exodus led by Maurya but the leadership realised the importance of OBC communities. To win their support, the bulk share of tickets in the first list went to them," he said.The OBC plays an important and decisive role in Uttar Pradesh politics and constitutes over 50 per cent of the total electorate of the state. While the non-Yadav OBCs constitute around 35 per cent of the state's total electorate.The BJP is eyeing to win the election for a second consecutive term with the support of non-Yadav OBC communities which supported them earlier in 2017 assembly polls and last two Lok Sabha polls in 2014 and 2019.A BJP leader claims that by giving majority shares to OBC candidates in the first list the party has tried to send a positive message to the backward communities."Political rivals misled the communities by saying that BJP uses OBCs' votes only to come to power and then ignores them. By giving 44 out of 107 tickets to OBCs, the party has shown that the it is with them. Earlier, a strong message was sent to the communities when 27 ministers belonging to backward classes were inducted in the union cabinet in July last year," he said.The state assembly polls will be held in seven phases in February-March starting from February 10. Counting of votes will be held on March 10.--IANS                                     #BJP                                     #UPelections                                     #YogiAdityanath||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/damage-control-in-first-list-bjp-gives-tickets-to-44-obc-candidates-in-up-361538

We have sought a legal opinion to move the appeal,” she said.Meanwhile, Bishop visited various churches and met former MLA P C George, who had been backing Mulakkal since the issue came out.The Bishop, after a brief meeting with George, left for other visits to churches nearby, but refused to comment before the media.George, who met the media after the meeting, said the case was an effort to target the Church.He said the case was part of a conspiracy to target the Church and the believers.Mulakkal, 57, was accused of raping the nun multiple times during his visit to a convent in this district between 2014 and 2016 when he was the Bishop of the Jalandhar Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church. The complainant is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus, a diocesan congregation under the Jalandhar Diocese.Acquitting the Bishop, the judge of the Additional District and Sessions Court I, Kottayam, in the order, said the victim’s claim that she was raped on 13 occasions under duress cannot be taken reliance on the basis of her solitary testimony.                                      #BishopFranco                                     #JalandharDiocese                                     #Kerala                                     #NunRape                                     #RomanCatholic||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/police-plan-to-appeal-against-bishop-francos-acquittal-in-nun-rape-case-361530
15-01-2022||IANSNew Delhi||Omicron looks less severe, but should not be taken lightly: Experts||As a new study from South Africa suggests that the Omicron Covid-19 variant is less severe even for the unvaccinated, Indian health experts on Saturday warned that it was too soon to come to any conclusion and the highly-transmissible strain should not be taken lightly.According to the experts, the Omicron variant is said to cause less severe disease. However, people should not stop taking precautionary measures, following Covid-19 protocols or getting vaccinated.“It is too soon to tell if this variant is less severe even for the unvaccinated. We definitely are witnessing less severity of symptoms in vaccinated people, so it is extremely important to get the vaccine,” Tushar Tayal, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine, Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, Gurugram told IANS.“The majority of people are facing mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, but we still do not know the long-term side effects of this variant, therefore I would urge everyone to exercise caution and not take Omicron lightly at all,” Tayal added.The South African study, led by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in the country, suggests that unvaccinated people who were infected with the highly-infectious Omicron variant are less likely to fall seriously ill, require hospitalisation, or die compared to the previous Covid strains.The study comes at a time when the Omicron variant is spreading like a wildfire across the globe, including India. South Africa has witnessed the fourth wave which is now flattening.“As far as whether this variant will lead to the third wave in India or not, I would say that with the spike of cases in the past two weeks, we are witnessing it now,” Tayal said.“But as compared to the last wave, we are seeing fewer hospitalisations,” he added.Navneet Sood, Pulmonary Consultant from Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, New Delhi said that if we do not take adequate precautions then we will for sure invite the third wave.“Data from South Africa, the first country to have a major outbreak caused by the strain, has so far shown lower hospitalisation and death rates but it does not mean that people become careless,” Sood told IANS.“Masks are a must. Everyone must follow the covid-19 protocols seriously,” he added.The South African study compared 11,609 patients from the first three Covid-19 waves with 5,144 patients from the new Omicron-driven wave.The researchers found that eight per cent of patients died or were hospitalised within 14 days of testing positive for Covid during the fourth Omicron wave, compared to 16.5 per cent in the first three Covid waves.With a daily increase of 5 per cent, India, so far, has 6,041 confirmed cases of Omicron.                                     #Covid                                     #experts                                     #Omicron                                     #severe||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/omicron-looks-less-severe-but-should-not-be-taken-lightly-experts-361523

He had been the MP from Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seat since 1998 until he became the chief minister in 2017.BJP names 107 candidates for UP election; Yogi Adityanath to contest from GorakhpurSpeaking to reporters here, the SP chief said, "As far as contesting elections is concerned, earlier it was said that he (Adityanath) will contest from Mathura, Prayagraj, Ayodhya or Deoband. I am happy that the BJP has already sent him home (Gorakhpur)” “Although he is in Gorakhpur, he had a ticket dated March 11 (counting of votes on March 10) booked for it earlier. I think that he should stay back in Gorakhpur and there is no need for him to return (to Lucknow). Heartiest congratulations," Yadav said.The SP chief further said no MLAs or ministers quitting the BJP will be taken into his party anymore."I would tell the BJP that I am no longer going to take BJP MLAs or ministers (into SP), you can cut their tickets," he said.However, he later said that a BJP leader will soon be joining the SP but did not reveal his name.When asked about former Uttar Pradesh minister Dara Singh Chauhan, who recently quit the BJP, Yadav said that he will soon join the SP.Former Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister and prominent OBC leader Swami Prasad Maurya on Friday joined the Samajwadi Party along with another rebel minister Dharam Singh Saini.Five BJP MLAs and Apna Dal (Sonelal) legislator Amar Singh Chaudhary also joined the SP in the presence of Yadav.Yadav's statements came after the BJP announced the names of 107 candidates for the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls and fielded Adityanath from the Gorakhpur (Urban) assembly constituency.The party has named candidates for the seats going to polls in the first two phases.The list was released by BJP's Uttar Pradesh in-charge and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan along with party general secretary Arun Singh during a press conference at the party's headquarters in Delhi.Pradhan said Adityanath will be the BJP's candidate from Gorakhpur city and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya from Sirathu. Both are currently members of the state's legislative council.Elections for the 403-member Uttar Pradesh assembly are scheduled to be held in seven phases starting from February 10.                                      #Akhilesh                                     #BJP                                     #Gorakhpur                                     #UPElections2022                                     #UPPolls                                     #YogiAdityanath||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-has-already-sent-adityanath-home-says-akhilesh-after-up-chief-minister-fielded-from-gorakhpur-361520
15-01-2022||New Delhi||China-India trade at record high despite border tension||An increase in China-India trade in 2021, which reached a record high surpassing $125 billion amid bilateral tensions, is just another piece of proof that New Delhi is unable to reduce its dependence on the Chinese market, Beijing’s state media claimed.The total amount of trade between China and India in 2021 stood at $125.66 billion, up 43.3 per cent from 2020, said the Global Times report citing statistics released by the General Administration of Customs (GAC).Of which, China’s exports to India were $97.52 billion, up 46.2 per cent, while China imported $28.14 billion worth of goods from India, up 34.2 per cent.Analysts attributed the surge in trade to the complementary aspects of the industrial chains of the two countries.For example, about 50-60 per cent of chemicals and other materials used by the Indian pharmaceutical industry, which is a pillar industry, are imported from China.India was China’s 15th largest trade partner in 2021, the Global Times quoted the GAC as saying.“Analysts said that the boycott of Made-in-China products will not balance the trade deficit and that boosting India’s exports to China is the right choice. Meanwhile, India should not exclude China when it seeks free trade agreements as China is already involved in international free trade mechanisms,” the Global Times said.Total trade between China and countries that have signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) - 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - expanded significantly in 2021.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/china-india-trade-at-record-high-despite-border-tension-361516

15-01-2022||New Delhi||ED attaches Delhi-based journalist's property in money laundering case||The Enforcement Directorate on Saturday said it had attached a Delhi-based journalist's residential property worth Rs 48.21 lakh in connection with a money laundering probe linked to the alleged leakage and supply of sensitive information to Chinese intelligence officers.A provisional order has been issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to attach the property of freelance journalist Rajeev Sharma in the national capital's Pitampura area, the ED said in a statement.Sharma, who was arrested by the agency in July last year, was granted bail in the case by the Delhi High Court last week.The agency said its probe found that "Sharma had supplied confidential and sensitive information to Chinese intelligence officers, in exchange for remuneration thereby compromising the security and national interests of the country"."Such remuneration to Rajeev Sharma was being provided by a Mahipalpur-based shell company that was run by Chinese nationals like Zhang Cheng alias Suraj, Zhang Lixia alias Usha and Qing Shi along with a Nepali national Sher Singh alias Raj Bohara."This Chinese company was acting as a conduit for the Chinese intelligence agencies to provide remuneration for persons like Rajeev Sharma...," the ED said in the statement.The remuneration, it claimed, was being paid in cash through carriers as well as through cash deposits."Sharma also received money using the bank account of his friend in order to conceal his involvement in criminal activities. In addition to obtaining remunerations in cash, he also received remuneration in kind in the form of various paid foreign trips which were arranged by the Chinese intelligence agents," the ED alleged.The agency's case is based on a Delhi Police FIR filed under the Official Secrets Act and various sections of the IPC against Sharma in 2020.The journalist was arrested by the special cell of Delhi Police on September 14, 2020 and charged with passing on information about the Indian Army's deployment and the country's border strategy to Chinese intelligence officers.The ED had also filed a chargesheet in this case last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-attaches-delhi-based-journalists-property-in-money-laundering-case-361495
15-01-2022||Lahore||Punjabi Lehr reunited over 200 families from India and Pakistan, says blogger who connected 2 brothers 74 years after Partition||Much like the landmark Kartarpur Corridor that connects India and Pakistan, Punjabi Lehr, the Pakistan-based YouTube channel that brought together two brothers separated by Partition after 74 years and got many a little teary-eyed, has reunited over 200 friends and families across the border.Separated at India-Pakistan partition, brothers meet at Kartarpur after 74 yearsA video of the tearful reunion, showing the elderly brothers, one from India and another from Pakistan, hugging each other at the visa-free Kartarpur Corridor this week, has gone viral.Emotions run high and tears wouldn't stop from the eyes of septuagenarian brothers who were divided during Indo Pak partition but reunited at Kartarpur Sahib after 74 years.While keeping aside their bilateral differences India Pakistan have opened #KartarpurCorridor onNov 9,2019 pic.twitter.com/oIO1cSspcMThe emotional meeting of 84-year-old Saddique Khan from Pakistan's Punjab and his brother from Indian Punjab, Habib alias Sikka Khan, lasted more than an hour before the brothers returned to their respective homes.The reunion of the two octogenarian brothers separated during Partition in 1947, in addition to being a showstopper for pilgrims in Kartarpur, also put a spotlight on the Pakistan-based YouTube channel that helped them meet and hug each other after 74 years.Nasir Dhillon, who runs his YouTube channel with over 531,000 subscribers, says the channel's aim is “to bridge a gap between the peoples of East and West Punjab, created by Partition."  “With the help of the people of both sides of the Indian and Pakistani Punjab, we have reunited over 200 friends and families across the border,” Dhillon told PTI."People from both sides of the border share their stories of separation from their immediate family members, relatives and friends during bloody riots of Participation in 1947, and some link is found through such videos (stories) that help find their loved ones, friends and their ancestral houses," said Dhillon, who runs the channel with Bhupinder Singh Lovely of Nankana Sahib.The 37-year-old man from Faisalabad who served as a police officer for 12 years in Punjab Police started his YouTube channel some four years ago.He said his grandfather gave him the motivation to start the channel to help reunite the families and friends separated by Partition and promote love among the people across the border.“My grandfather was from Indian Punjab village Karan Taran Panjwar. He would tell me stories of the partition that kindled my interest in doing something related to reuniting the people across the border," he said."My grandfather and my father had a desire to visit the village but unfortunately they left the world without having this desire fulfilled," he said.Dhillon, a father of three who is in the real estate business, said he too wants to visit his ancestral village if the Indian government provides him a visa.Uploading a clip of over 84-year-old Saddique Khan of Faisalabad (some 130 kms from Lahore) some two years ago on the channel helped trace his younger brother on another side of Punjab.This week Saddique met his lost brother Habib alias Sikka Khan at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur in an emotional reunion after 74 years. In an over one-hour meeting, Saddique who was 10 years old in 1947, tried to recollect his memories related to his family.Younger Sikka was one-and-a-half-year-old at that time. “My mother, young Habib who was in her lap and younger sister were at grandparents' house when the riots broke out. My father and I left for Pakistan in a chaotic situation. On the way my father was killed,” Dhillon quoted Saddique as having said.Dhillon said when he uploaded the interview of Saddique talking about his lost brother during Partition about two years ago, a doctor from Canada contacted him and informed him he belonged to Phulewal village of Indian Punjab and helped trace Sikka.“Both brothers then were connected by WhatsApp video call and talked hours about their family,” Dhillon said.Sikka told Saddique their mother committed suicide by jumping into a canal as she had developed a mental disorder after losing her husband, son and some other relatives. Their sister also died a few years after Partition, he said.Saddique was brought up by his uncle while Sikka was taken care of by a Sikh family. Saddique got married and had children and grandchildren while Sikka remained single, he said."Since Sikka even did not have a passport and to get an Indian visa for Saddique was not easy, it was decided that the former should reach Kartarpur Sahib using the corridor which does not require a visa,” Dhillon said.He said both brothers might have been united over a year ago at the corridor if the restrictions had not been imposed by India due to Covid-19.Saddique has appealed to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan to help his brother get a visa for a longer period so that he could travel to Pakistan and live with him, he said.“Now both brothers talk over the phone and may meet again using the corridor,” he said, urging the Indian and Pakistan governments to allow senior citizens to have visa-free travel into each other's side.Dhillon also talked about a number of stories of Indian Sikhs who visited their ancestral residences in Pakistan's Punjab province in recent times.The Kartarpur Corridor links Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan, the final resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev, with the Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur district in India's Punjab state.The 4 km-long corridor provides visa-free access to Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit the Darbar Sahib.In November 2019, Prime Minister Khan formally inaugurated the Kartarpur Corridor as part of the commemoration of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak at a colourful ceremony, paving the way for Indian Sikh pilgrims to visit one of their religion's holiest sites in Pakistan without needing a visa.                                      #KartarpurCorridor||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/punjabi-lehr-reunited-over-200-families-from-india-and-pakistan-says-blogger-who-connected-2-brothers-74-years-after-partition-361494
15-01-2022||Shubhadeep Choudhury ||Stolen 10th century yogini sculpture heading back to India||New Delhi, January 15Stolen sculpture of a goat-headed Yogini has been handed over to the High Commissioner Gaitri Issar Kumar in London for repatriation to India.The 10th century stone statue was stolen from a temple in Lokhari, Uttar Pradesh in the 1980s. It had briefly surfaced in the art market in London in 1988.In a press release, the High Commission of India in London said it was happy to announce the recovery and repatriation of a “very special stone idol” that was illegally removed from a temple in Lokhari, Banda, Uttar Pradesh, sometime in the 1980s.Indian Pride Project, Singapore and Art Recovery International, London, assisted the Indian High Commission in UK in the identification and recovery of the statue. The High Commission processed the requisite documentation with British and Indian authorities, stated the press release.The goat-headed Yogini sculpture originally belonged to a group of stone deities carved in sandstone and installed at the Lokhari temple. The deities had been subject of a study by Indian scholar Vidya Dahejia on behalf of the National Museum in New Delhi in 1986. The study was later published under the title “Yogini Culy and Temples : A Tantric Tradition”.A similar sculpture of a buffalo-headed Yogini, apparently stolen from the same temple at Lokhari village, was recovered and repatriated by the Indian Embassy in Paris in 2013. The “Vrishanana Yogini” has been kept at the National Museum, New Delhi, an Archeological Survey of India (ASI) official said.“Yoginis are a group of powerful female divinities, associated with the Tantric mode of worship. They are worshipped as a group”, Gautam Sengupta, former Director General of ASI, told this reporter.The goat-headed Yogini received at the High Commission is being dispatched to the ASI for conservation, the press release by the High Commission of India in UK, stated.                                     #deities                                     #Lokharitemple                                     #stolen                                     #yoginisculpture||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stolen-10th-century-yogini-sculpture-heading-back-to-india-361489
15-01-2022||---||January 16 to be celebrated as National Startup Day: Modi||New Delhi, January 15Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday announced that January 16 would now be celebrated as National Start-Up Day in order to spread the culture of start-ups in every corner of the country.“While in the pre-2014 era, only big businesses in the metros were prospering, today there is at least one start-up in 625 districts of the country. Of them, half are in tier 2 and tier 3 cities where youth from poor and ordinary families are engaged in developing start-ups. As a result lakhs are getting employment which is demonstrated by the speed and scale at which start-ups grew in India even during the global pandemic,” said the Prime Minister while virtually interacting with start-ups.The golden era of start-ups is starting, declared the PM at the Start-Up India Innovation Week, while asking innovators and entrepreneurs not to keep their dreams local. Hundreds of hackathons organised by the government in record time gave many solutions. “You would also be feeling that different government departments and ministries are in touch with the youth and start-ups, encouraging their new ideas such as new drone rules or the new space policy. The government’s priority is to give as many youth as possible the opportunity for innovation.”“We are seeing the results,” said the PM while pointing out that as against 4,000 patents registered in 2013-14, last year (2020-21), the comparative figure was 28,000. As against 70,000 trademarks registered in 2013-14, over 2.5 lakh were registered last year. The movement for innovation has resulted in improvement of India’s ranking on the Global Innovation Index from 81 to 46.In order to aid this process, the government extricated entrepreneurship and innovation from the web of bureaucratic silos. At the same time, the government set up institutional mechanisms to ensure hand-holding of young innovators. ‘Start-Up India, Stand-India’ type of programmes are part of such attempts, he said, while stating that “start-ups are changing the rule of the game and will be the backbone of new India”.The government was helping them convert ideas into business. After the new drone policy, the army, air force and navy have placed orders worth Rs 500 crore on many innovators in this segment. The government would also deploy drones on a large scale for mapping village properties. The rapid urbanisation can also be a big focus area though the PM did not mention ‘smart cities’.                                     #NationalStartupDay                                     #PMModi                                     #startup||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/january-16-to-be-celebrated-as-national-startup-day-modi-361488

With the notification for polling in 58 segments of 11 districts in western UP, the filing of nominations has begun.For the first phase of the seven-phase elections in the state, nominations can be filed till January 21. Scrutiny will take place on January 24 and the last date for withdrawal of nominations is January 27. The polling will take place on February 10.Elections for the 403-member UP Assembly will start from western part of the state on February 10 and move eastward.The first phase will see polling to major segments where the impact of the year-long farmers’ agitation would be felt.These segments include Kairana, Shamli, Budhana, Purqazi, Muzaffarnagar, Khatauli, Meerapur, Siwalkhas, Sardhana, Hastinapur, Meerut, Meerut Cantt and Meerut (South), Loni, Bagpat, Baraut and Chaprauli among others.Majority of these seats are with the BJP, which is facing the ire of farmers, led by BKU national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, whose native village Sisauli falls in Muzaffarnagar.The SP-RLD combine is presenting a major challenge to the ruling BJP in the western UP sector, with Tikait-led Jats sympathetic towards the RLD.Late RLD chief Ajit Singh had called up Rakesh Tikait last January after the latter broke into tear on being forced to vacate the protest site along UP-Delhi border at Ghazipur. Locals in the area say Tikait’s teary appeal to Jats and Ajit Singh’s public support to him at the time turned the tide, putting the ruling BJP on the defensive.Yogi eats at Dalit’s house, targets SPGorakhpur: UP CM Yogi Adityanath had a meal at a Dalit household here on Friday and said during the SP rule there was “social exploitation” and not “social justice”, whereas the BJP govt was working for the development of every section of society.

A Bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and JK Maheshwari said failure to control an adult brother, living independently, or giving advice to adjust to sister-in-law to avoid retaliation cannot constitute cruelty to the bride within the meaning of Section 498A of the IPC.Section 498 A refers to husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty. The case was lodged by a woman against her husband and in-laws for subjecting her to cruelty.The apex court’s observations came while hearing an appeal against an order passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana dismissing a plea by a man seeking permission to return to the US, where he is employed. The HC had rejected the man’s prayer to leave the country as he was arrayed as an accused along with his elder brother and parents under Sections Sections 323 (voluntary causing hurt), 34 (common intention), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) 498A and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.The SC said the complainant (daughter-in-law) had not given any particulars of the jewellery that had allegedly been taken by her mother-in-law and brother-in-law. “There is not a whisper of whether any jewellery is lying with the petitioner,” it said. “In our considered opinion, the CJM, Kurukshetra, erred in directing the appellant not to leave the country without prior permission of the court,” it said. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/keeping-brides-jewellery-for-safety-not-cruelty-sc-361373
15-01-2022||New Delhi||Ahead of R-Day, IED recovered from Ghazipur flower market||An improvised explosive device (IED) stuffed with RDX and ammonium nitrate was found inside an unattended bag at the Ghazipur flower market here today, but it was later defused, officials said. The explosive was kept in an iron box and concealed in the black coloured backpack. The incident comes ahead of Republic Day celebrations on January 26 for which the security apparatus in the national capital is already on high alert.“The explosive prima facie looks to be a mix of RDX and ammonium nitrate. It was about 3 kg in weight and there were some sharpnel embedded,” NSG Director General MA Ganapathy said.Another National Security Guard (NSG) officer said they were alerted by the Delhi Police about the suspicious object around 11 am and soon after a team of its bomb detection and disposal experts and a heavy metal container called total containment vessel tugged to a truck reached the market, located close to Delhi’s border with Uttar Pradesh. Fire officials said they received the information of the suspicious unattended bag at 10.19 am.Officials from the special cell of Delhi Police and fire department also reached the spot. “The IED was destroyed around 1.30 pm by using a controlled explosion technique after it was lowered into a deep pit located in the area. The IED samples have been collected and a detail report will be sent to the Delhi Police,” the NSG officer said. A bomb suit wearing NSG personnel was also seen at the site apart from officials from the special cell and regular Delhi Police units.According to preliminary investigation, the bomb was placed at the main gate of the flower market.“It is suspected that the alleged person did the recee before planting the bomb and we suspect there was a timer placed inside the bomb. The investigation is still underway to ascertain who and how the bomb was placed,” a senior police official said.A case would be registered under the Explosive Act as of now, he said. —                                     #IED                                     #RDaysecurity                                     #Republicday||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-r-day-ied-recovered-from-ghazipur-flower-market-361372

His Punjab counterpart is “conspicuously silent in his affidavit on the aspect”.Justice Amol Rattan Singh has asked Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh DGPs to file affidavits on the compliance of Supreme Court directions. The directions came after accused Kaushal filed a plea through senior advocate Bipan Ghai with counsel Paras Talwar. He was seeking directions for conducting videography from the time of leaving the jail premises till reaching the police station concerned for interrogation. Ghai also prayed for a direction to record the interrogation.Ghai also referred to the SC directions in the case of “Paramvir Singh Saini versus Baljit Singh”. Justice Amol Rattan Singh asserted the SC directions were to the extent of installing cameras at the main gates of the police stations, the entry and exit points, in all lock-ups, corridors, lobby, reception areas, verandas, out-houses, officials’ rooms, outside the lock-up rooms, station hall and in front of the police station compound. The cameras were also to be installed outside washrooms and toilets.“The obvious implication is that no part of the police stations would be left uncovered by CCTV surveillance. Naturally, therefore, any interrogation room would also be covered by such directions,” Justice Amol Rattan Singh asserted.Police stations under e-surveillanceNo part of the police stations would be left uncovered by CCTVs... interrogation room would also be covered by such directions (of the SC). — Justice Amol Rattan Singh,Punjab and Haryana High Court                                     #CCTV                                     #Highcourt                                     #InterrogationunderCCTV||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-paves-way-for-police-quizzing-under-cctv-361370

Refraining from any way in pushing for a RIC summit of the three leaders — Narendra Modi, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping, Lavrov said, “If RIC can be useful to strengthen trust and confidence, this is something we are going to support.”Lavrov thus did not pursue the idea of a RIC summit that was suggested by Russian Presidential aide Yury Ushakov last month, a fortnight after Putin made a rare overseas trip during the pandemic to hold consultations with PM Modi. South Block, in private, had told Moscow that such a summit was impossible as long as India and China were engaged in a tense standoff in eastern Ladakh. Instead, the Russian Foreign Minister seemed to suggest that China and India were better off with a direct dialogue on security issues.“I know India and China have a direct dialogue on many issues, including security. I know there is a declaration of strategic partnership between India and China,” he said. The RIC format also deals with economic formats of cooperation which are promising, he says. “We highly value our relationship with India,” he added at a marathon three-hour press conference during which a major portion was devoted to Russia’s talks with the West on achieving strategic stability.Value our relationship with IndiaIf Russia-India-China grouping can strengthen trust, this is something we are going to support. We value our relationship with India. — Sergei Lavrov, Russian foreign minister                                     #China                                     #India||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lavrov-hopes-ric-will-promote-trust-between-india-and-china-361366

The 14th round of military commander-level talks on January 12 ended without a resolution to PP-15.Troops on either side stand within rifle-shot range of each other at a small patch on what is called PP-15 or Hot Springs. It is no more than 5-km wide in the barren icy desert of Ladakh at an altitude of more than 16,000 feet.The soldiers from both sides were not expected to move back from the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in immediate or near future, said sources. It would be incorrect to hope that a resolution to PP-15 would restore status quo as of April 2020, said a senior functionary. Even if the first step of disengaging from PP-15 is done, the LAC will not be what it used to be before April 2020.Indian Army Chief General MM Naravane on January 12 was categorical on a three-step process to ease the standoff: disengagement of troops, de-escalation of tension followed by de-induction of all troops, weapons and equipment.“Until that is done, India stays put at the LAC,” the General had said. As of now, even the first step of disengagement had not been competed, said sources.The way the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China had deployed troops, weapons, guns and equipment all across the 3,488-km LAC, it made no military sense for India to move back from either eastern Ladakh or anywhere else, said a defence expert. India has relocated its troops from the western front to the northern borders.All existing protocols on managing the boundary between the two nations stand breached. There is no guarantee that China will not make another unilateral attempt at altering the status quo at the LAC, which is not demarcated on ground. It was only a perception of either of the countries, said the expert.For India to move back, it would have to factor in what was militarily called “differential of mobilisation”, meaning the time taken by either of the two Armies to mobilise in case of an exigency, said sources.The Tibetan plateau is flat and the PLA has easy access. On the Indian side, the Himalayas hold the key to the approach to the plateau in Ladakh. The high mountain passes get snowed out and roads are closed. It takes a truck from Chandigarh or Jammu some three days to reach Leh. Guns and tank transporters could take even more time. The PLA could redeploy within six to eight hours.Despite the roads, hauling of logistics and equipment is the problem across the Himalayas. This hurdle exists across Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim or Arunachal Pradesh, the states that share boundary with Tibet.No border protocolHimalayas vs Tibetan plateau mobilisation factorIndia In case of an exigency, Indian troops have to cross the Himalayas, which get snowed out in winter. A truck from Chandigarh or Jammu takes three days to reach Leh. Transportation of guns and ammo takes even longer.China The dragon nation only has to cross the Tibetan plateau, which is flat and the People’s Liberation Army of China has easy access to it. Moreover, China has built hi-tech infrastructure on its side of the LAC.Govt has jeopardised close neighboursThe govt first surrendered our land and has now jeopardised our close neighbours by its inaction in pushing back China.

The Court of Inquiry has submitted its preliminary findings, the IAF said.“The accident was the result of entry into clouds due to unexpected change in weather in the valley. This led to spatial disorientation of the pilot, resulting in controlled flight into terrain (CFIT),” it said.CFIT is term used when an aircraft crashes into the ground due to disorientation of the crew and not a technical glitch. It is noted as a common reason for crashes during bad weather in mountainous regions. A Russian-built Mi-17V5 copter carrying the CDS, his wife Madhulika and his military attache Brig LS Lidder among others crashed on December 8 near Wellington in Coonoor, Tamil Nadu.Air Marshal Manvendra Singh, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Training Command, who headed the tri-service inquiry into the crash, analysed the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder, besides questioning all available witnesses to determine the most probable cause of the accident.The recommendations made by the Court of Inquiry were being reviewed, the Indian Air Force said.Meanwhile, as reported by The Tribune in its December 10 edition, there was no distress call by the pilots and they had told the air traffic controller (ATC) about descending to land at Wellington.Coonoor crashThe accident was the result of entry into clouds due to unexpected change in weather in the valley.

15-01-2022||New Delhi||WHO recommends two new drugs to treat Covid patients||The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday recommended two new drugs for Covid, providing more options for treating the disease. The extent to which the medicines will save lives depends on how widely available and affordable these will be.The first drug, baricitinib, is strongly recommended for patients with severe or critical Covid, the WHO said, noting that the fourth pandemic wave driven by Omicron in Africa was flattening after a six-week surge. The WHO, however, cautioned nations against treating Omicron as “common cold or mild”, citing record 15 million infections in seven days.Baricitinib is part of a class of drugs called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors that suppress the overstimulation of the immune system. It’s an oral drug used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.The World Health Organisation has also conditionally recommended monoclonal antibody drug sotrovimab for treating mild or moderate Covid in patients who are at high risk of hospitalisation. This includes patients who are older, immunocompromised, having underlying conditions like diabetes, hypertension and obesity and those unvaccinated.“About 15 million cases in seven days is a record high. We have seen 43,000 deaths. You do see a lower proportion of cases dying but as Omicron circulates among the vulnerable, we will see increasing hospitalisations and deaths,” said WHO technical lead on Covid Maria Van Kerkhove.Tackling virusBaricitinib: Used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, it’s recommended for patients with severe or critical CovidSotrovimab: Conditionally recommended for mild or moderate patients facing high hospitalisation risk                                     #Covid19                                     #Covidvaccine                                     #Omcronscare                                     #WHOguidelines||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-recommends-two-new-drugs-to-treat-covid-patients-361335

By adding non-Yadav OBCs into its fold, the SP aims to shed the tag of being a Muslim-Yadav party. Taking a dig at the recent resignations from the BJP, Akhilesh said: “Wickets gir rahe hein (wickets are dropping)”. Others who joined the SP today were one of the two MLAs of BJP ally Apna Dal who have quit and some former MLAs from other parties. Maurya, whose exit triggered an exodus, vowed to ‘finish’ the BJP in the upcoming polls. Challenging Yogi’s controversial assertion that the UP polls were a “80 per cent vs 20 per cent” fight, Maurya claimed the contest was in fact “85 per cent vs 15 per cent”, 85 per cent being OBCs, Dalits, Muslims, etc.While BJP leaders term the party-hopping a normal activity during election time, the developments have put a question mark on leadership’s strategy to rely on “imports” to win elections. Similar exits were also seen in West Bengal. Observers said most of those who quit the BJP in UP this week came from other parties with no RSS or BJP background. “They joined the BJP looking for greener pastures and left when the situation became tough. They saw a better deal and deserted. If anyone leaves after serving as ministers, everyone knows it is political opportunism,” they said. However, a section also added that “several loyal and dedicated BJP leaders were ignored and tickets were given to these turncoats. The developments put a big question mark on the BJP’s strategy”.Notably, many of those who quit Mamata Banerjee-led TMC in West Bengal to join the BJP ahead of the 2021 Assembly elections returned after the saffron party’s defeat, the most prominent being Mukul Roy.Yogi’s Dalit outreach today came at a time when some OBC leaders have quit the BJP, accusing it of being anti-Dalit/OBC, and have joined the SP. The Chief Minister claimed that during the SP rule there was “social exploitation”, whereas the BJP government was working for the development of every section of society without any discrimination.“Only 18,000 houses were given to people under the PM Awas Yojana during the five-year term of the Akhilesh Yadav government in UP, whereas the BJP government has given 45 lakh houses to the poor and the deprived,” he said.3 ministers & 7 MLAs have quit BJP so far3 OBC ministers2 of them with SP7 MLAs, mostly OBCs5 of them with SPSP MLC quitsSamajwadi Party Legislative Council Member (MLC) Ghanshyam Singh Lodhi has resigned, accusing it of “neglecting the backward classes and Dalits”.BJP Losing wicketsThe BJP wickets are falling one after the other.

15-01-2022||Kottayam (Kerala)||Nun's supporters express shock as Bishop Franco gets clean chit in rape case||The acquittal of Roman Catholic Bishop Franco Mulakkal of charges of raping a nun in a Kerala convent by a court here triggered emotional reactions on Friday as nuns who support the survivor expressed shock and dismay over the verdict and said they would continue the fight till justice is prevailed while the jubilant bishop urged followers to 'praise the lord and be happy'.A group of nuns of Kuravilangad Convent here, who have been standing with the survivor in her fight, were on the verge of tears when they said they were yet to believe such a verdict came out from the court and they did not know what has happened.The survivor and her supporters stay in the Kuravilangad convent in this south Kerala district.Sister Anupama, who was the face of the nun's years-long fight for justice, said they would surely challenge the verdict in the higher court and take forward the fight of their hapless colleague."We will continue our stay in the convent and take forward our fight till our sister gets justice. Police and prosecution showed justice to us but we did not get the expected justice from the judiciary," the teary-eyed nun told reporters.In a broken voice, she also said the verdict gives them a message that ordinary mortals like them should never break their silence against any injustice and fight a case whatever happened to them in the life."Those who are wealthy and influential can do anything in this society. That is what we see around us now. We have never felt anything strange till the time of argument of the case. We believe it was sabotaged after that," she said.When asked whether they would be safe in the convent and they expect any ill-treatment from the church authorities in the wake of the verdict, she said they had never been safe there and they could not reveal many things happening inside the institution.Sister Anupama also made it clear that they were even ready to die to get justice for the survivor.Meanwhile, a visibly relieved and emotional Mulakkal, who arrived in the court to hear the verdict, burst into tears, hugged his followers and lawyers, sharing his joy over the verdict."Only the trees that bear fruits are stoned. I am just proud of that. Praise the Lord," an elated bishop told reporters outside the court.When asked what he has to say to his followers and faithful, the priest urged them to praise the lord and be happy.Some of his followers were even seen crying out of joy knowing the acquittal of the bishop.Investigators, lawyers and social activists who stood with the nun in her fight against Mulakkal expressed shock over the verdict, saying it was totally unexpected.Terming the verdict as "very very unfortunate" and "unnatural'', senior IPS officer S Harishankar, who had led the special investigation team in the rape case, said 100 per cent conviction was expected in the case and the verdict would be an "astonishment" for the entire legal system of the country.In the case, the survivor was a nun and the assailant was a person who was powerful enough to decide whether she should continue to live or die."The argument that the woman should have reacted at the time of molestation is unacceptable. An appeal will be filed in the higher court challenging this verdict. The state police chief already gave instructions in this regard and an appeal will be filed as soon as we get a copy of the verdict," he told reporters.Even the supreme court made it clear multiple times that the victim's statement, if it is consistent and not having massive contradictions, is a satisfactory piece of evidence for conviction, he said, adding that it would give a wrong message to society and those suffering similar assaults silently.Public prosecutor, Jithesh J Babu, said it was a single-line judgment and could avail the details only after getting the copy of the verdict."We do not know what has happened. Thirty-nine witnesses have given their statements supporting the prosecution. No one has turned hostile. As many as 122 documents had been submitted and there was ample evidence. There was no lapse in anything," he said.He also said the verdict would be challenged in the higher court and the decision would be taken after consulting with the government and the investigators.Activist-nun Sister Lucy Kalappura, who took part in the survivor's fight for justice and was expelled from her congregation recently, said the verdict was regrettable and expressed hope that justice would be prevail at any cost in the higher court.In a brief Malayalam statement issued soon after the verdict, the Jalandhar diocese thanked those who believed in the innocence of the Bishop till date and provided him with the necessary legal assistance."The prosecution has failed miserably in proving the charges against the Bishop", said a lawyer in the Bishop's legal team.Mulakkal, 57, was accused of raping the nun multiple times during his visit to a convent in this district when he was the Bishop of the Jalandhar diocese of the Roman Catholic church.As the prosecution failed to produce evidence against the accused, the Additional District and Sessions Court I, Kottayam, acquitted the Bishop.The rape case against the Bishop was registered by police in Kottayam district in June, 2018.In her complaint to the police, the nun had alleged that she was subjected to sexual abuse by Franco between 2014 and 2016.The Special Investigation Team which probed the case, arrested the Bishop in September 2018 and charged him with wrongful confinement, rape, unnatural sex and criminal intimidation.Trial in the case, started in November 2019, had concluded on January 10. The court had restrained the print and electronic media from publishing any matter relating to the trial in the case without its permission.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/nun-rape-court-verdict-supporters-of-survivor-express-shock-say-praise-the-lord-361224
