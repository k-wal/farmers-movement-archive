02-01-2022||New Delhi||Take measures to avoid mixing-up of vaccines: Mandaviya to states on 15-18 age group vaccination||Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Sunday said states and union territories should take necessary measures, including setting up separate vaccination centres, to avoid mixing-up of Covid vaccines during administration of shots to those in the 15-18 age group.Inoculation of children in this age category will start on January 3.The vaccine option for those in the 15-18 age group would only be Covaxin, according to a set of new guidelines issued by the Union Health Ministry. Besides Covaxin, the adult population of the country is being administered Covishield and Sputnik V. To ensure smooth implementation of the guidelines, Mandaviya held an online interaction with health ministers and principal secretaries and additional chief secretaries for health of states and union territories (UTs).He advised them to ensure orientation of vaccinators and vaccination team members for the inoculation exercise for those in the 15-18 age group and for identification of dedicated vaccination session sites for this category of beneficiaries, a health ministry statement said.“To avoid mixing-up of vaccines during administration, separate Covid vaccination centres (CVCs), separate session sites, separate queue (if at same session where adult vaccination is ongoing) and separate vaccination team (if at same session site) are to be strived for,” Mandaviya said.States and UTs were advised to share their requirement of vaccine doses by giving district-wise estimation of beneficiaries, using Co-WIN, and plan for distribution of Covaxin to identified session sites well in advance, the statement said.Mandaviya reviewed the public health preparedness for COVID-19 and progress of the national vaccination campaign in view of rising cases of the Omicron variant.The statement said that he also reviewed the recent decisions to roll-out vaccination for the 15-18 age group and “precautionary dose” (third dose) for identified vulnerable categories.The online meeting was officiated by Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan.The minister noted that at the outset, countries are experiencing three to four times surge in Covid cases in comparison to their earlier peaks.The Omicron variant being highly transmissible, a high surge could overwhelm the medical system, Mandaviya noted.He advised states to leave no stone unturned in ramping up infrastructure to manage a high surge so that India escapes unscathed from this episode of the pandemic, the statement stated.Mandaviya said in this regard, irrespective of Covid variants, measures for preparedness and protection remain the same.He urged states and UTs to re-invigorate their teams to work at the ground level and strengthen monitoring and containment mechanisms.In the meeting, a detailed discussion on various aspects of Covid management, including ramping up hospital infrastructure, increasing testing, stringent restrictive measures for breaking the chain of transmission, and stress on Covid-appropriate behaviour, was held, the statement said.Critical bottlenecks in medical infrastructure were also discussed.Applauding the dedication shown by states in their fight against the pandemic and in simultaneously ensuring welfare of people, Mandaviya said, “We have put up a strong fight against Covid earlier and this learning must be used to re-focus on efforts against the Omicron variant.”     He stressed on the continued need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour along with renewed and stringent focus on containment measures for addressing the present surge, the statement said.Underscoring the importance of vaccination, the minister observed, “We must focus on planning with regard to the 15-18 age group’s vaccination and precautionary doses for eligible beneficiaries.”         He also urged states to ensure that healthcare and frontline workers are fully vaccinated as they form the vulnerable categories.While appreciating efforts of states and UTs in achieving a national average of 90 per cent coverage of first dose vaccination of all eligible adults, he urged those states, whose progress is below the average, to ramp up their vaccination campaign.States were also advised to prepare a weekly plan to catch up and exceed the average national vaccination coverage and review implementation of the plan on a daily basis, the statement said Stress on the vaccination drive was especially on Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur where Assembly polls will be held, it said.              Mandaviya also pointed out that various measures are being taken by the Union government to ramp up infrastructure and vaccine production.He requested states and UTs to share their best practices so that the entire country can benefit.The minister pointed out that collectively, states and UTs have only used just over 17 per cent of the available approved funds under the Emergency COVID Response Package (ECRP-II), the statement said.States and UTs were exhorted to expedite the physical progress under ECRP-II in terms of ICU beds, oxygen beds, paediatric ICU and HDU beds etc.They were also asked to effectively use information technology tools for tele-medicine and tele-consultation, including training and capacity building of human resources, timely availability of ambulances, readiness of states to operationalise Covid facilities for institutional quarantining, and effective and supervised monitoring of those in home isolation.At the same time, he also urged states and UTs to better utilise approved funds under ECRP-II and invited any suggestions regarding the same, the statement said.State health ministers who joined the meet included S Pangnyu Phom (Nagaland),  N K Das (Odisha), Dr Prabhuram Choudhary (Madhya Prades), MA Subramanian (Tamil Nadu), Keshab Mahanta (Assam), Anil Vij (Haryana), Satyendar Jain

02-01-2022||---||PM lays foundation stone of Major Dhyan Chand Sports University in Meerut||New Delhi, January 2Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday lauded the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath-led government for playing tough with mafia and criminals, hitting out at BJP’s rivals in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.Addressing a public meeting after laying the foundation stone of Major Dhyan Chand Sports University in Meerut, the PM recalled the period when those indulging in “illegal occupation, harassing daughters used to go scot-free”. “During the tenure of the previous government, criminals used to play their games, the mafia used to play its games,” he said, lauding the Adityanath Government for “imposing fear of law among such criminals”. “Earlier, there were tournaments of illegal grabbing (of land). Those teasing, making ‘phabtiyaan’ (bad comments) on daughters used to roam openly.“People living in Meerut and adjoining areas can never forget how houses used to be set ablaze, and the earlier government used to indulge in games of criminals and the mafia,” he said, adding that due to this people were forced to leave their ancestral homes, leading to “exodus”.“Now, the government of Yogi (Adityanath) ji is playing ‘jail-jail’ with such criminals. Five years ago, the daughters of Meerut would fear leaving their homes after evening. Today, the daughters of Meerut are bringing laurels to the entire country,” he said.The Prime Minister said the role of a government is like that of a “guardian”, it should “encourage those with merit and should not try to justify mistakes as follies of youth”.  “If youths commit a mistake, it should not be ignored by saying ‘ladko se galti ho jaati hai’ (boys make mistakes)”, in an apparent jibe at Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav.Remembering Major Dhyan Chand, the PM said his government has given top priority to Indian players with the help of resources, modern facilities for training, international exposure and transparency in selection. Even in the new National Education Policy, priority has been given to sports, he said“Sports have now been kept in the same category as science, commerce or other studies. Earlier, sports were considered as extra-curricular activities, now schools will have it as a proper subject.“Sporting eco-system comprising sports, sports management, sports writing, sports psychology etc., creates new possibilities. This generates trust in the society that moving towards sports is the right decision”, he saidThe Rs 700-crore Sports University will be equipped with modern state-of-the-art infrastructure, including synthetic grounds for hockey, football, basketball /volleyball /handball /kabaddi, lawn tennis court, gymnasium, synthetic running stadium, swimming pool, multipurpose hall and a cycling velodrome, according to an official statement.The university will also have facilities for shooting, squash, gymnastics, weightlifting, archery, canoeing and kayaking.

02-01-2022||New Delhi||In pandemic-hit 2020-21, Railways earned over Rs 500 cr from Tatkal, premium Tatkal tickets||The Railways earned Rs 403 crore from tatkal ticket charges, an additional Rs 119 crore from premium tatkal tickets, and Rs 511 crore from dynamic fares during 2020-21, even as much of its operations remained suspended through most of the year due to the Covid pandemic, revealed an RTI reply. Passengers in these three categories are usually last minute travellers who avail these services mostly for emergency travel by paying premium charges. In a reply to a RTI filed by Madhya Pradesh-based Chandra Shekhar Gaur, the Railways said it earned Rs 240 crore from dynamic fares, Rs 353 crore from tatkal tickets and Rs 89 crore from premium tatkal charges in the financial year 2021-22 till September. In the 2019-20 financial year, when there were no restrictions in train operations, the national transporter earned Rs 1,313 crore from dynamic fares, Rs 1,669 from tatkal tickets and Rs 603 crore from premium tatkal tickets. The data from the Railway Ministry comes a month after a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Railways remarked that the charges levied on tatkal tickets are “a little unjustifiable” and put a huge burden particularly on those passengers who are financially weak and are forced to travel in urgency to meet their kith and kin or so for a very short distance also.The committee desired that the ministry devise measures for a pro rata fare for distance travelled. Tatkal ticket charges have been fixed as a percentage of fare at the rate of 10 per cent of basic fare for second class and 30 per cent of basic fare for all other classes subject to minimum and maximum.Under the premium version, which was introduced in 2014 in select trains, 50 per cent of tatkal quota tickets are sold using the dynamic fare system.The committee also said that flexi or dynamic pricing appeared to be “somewhat discriminatory” given the facts that fares of Rajdhanis, Shatabdis and Durontos are already higher as compared to other mail and express trains and are almost at par and at some instances higher than those of budget airlines. Data also shows that over 52 lakh people who were on wait list after finalisation of seat reservation charts could not travel by trains in the first six months of the current fiscal.Around 32,50,039 PNRs (passenger name records), against which 52,96,741 passengers had bookings, were auto-cancelled as they were in wait status after preparation of the charts till September of this financial year. “The problem is that we do not have enough trains to meet the demand of the general public. Those that can afford the premium fares, spend money to get tatkal tickets. Some trains are out of reach for some who cannot pay the dynamic fares. Even if we book in advance, the tickets are wait listed in most trains,” said Sujeet Rai, who travels to see his parents in Bihar every year.“What I do is book tickets in advance and when they are wait listed till the very end, I try and get tatkal tickets and cancel the previously booked ticket. Even if it’s not an emergency and you have made plans with your family, you have to try to get confirmed tickets,” he said. While the Railways did not launch any new trains during Covid-hit 2020-21, it brought in as many as 144 new train services in 2019-20, 266 services in 2018-2019, 170 services in 2017-2018 and 223 services in 2016-2017. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-pandemic-hit-2020-21-railways-earned-over-rs-500-cr-from-tatkal-premium-tatkal-tickets-357314

02-01-2022||Mumbai||PM Modi can’t claim to be ‘fakir’ after Rs 12 crore car in his cavalcade: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should not call himself a ‘fakir’ now with the addition of a “Rs 12 crore” car in his cavalcade.In his weekly column ‘Rokhthok’ in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, Raut also praised former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for always using an Indian-made car, and late PM Indira Gandhi for not replacing her security guards despite a threat to her life.“On December 28, media reported pictures of a Rs 12 crore car for Prime Minister Modi. A person who calls himself a fakir, a pradhan sevak, uses a foreign made car,” Raut said.“The prime minister’s security and comfort are important, but from now on, the pradhan sevak should not reiterate that he is a fakir (ascetic),” the Rajya Sabha member said.A Mercedes-Maybach S650 Guard was recently added to the prime minister’s cavalcade by the Special Protection Group.The price quoted for a Maybach car in a section of the media is over Rs 12 crore.  However, government sources had said the new car was a replacement of the BMW used by the prime minister as the German carmaker stopped production of the vehicle.Official sources had also said the SPG security detail has a six-year norm to replace vehicles used for the protectee and that Modi has not given any preference on which cars to use. They also said that the car costs about one-third of the price quoted in the media.Raut on Sunday said Modi, who started ‘swadeshi’ initiatives like ‘Make in India’ and ‘Start-Up India’, is using a foreign manufactured car.Praising Jawaharlal Nehru, the Shiv Sena’s spokesperson said the country’s first prime minister, despite security threat after the partition, always used an Indian-made Ambassador car.He also said that (former PM) Indira Gandhi, despite a threat to her life, did not change Sikh security personnel deployed for her security. Besides, (former prime minister) Rajiv Gandhi mingled with crowd in Tamil Nadu and got killed by the LTTE, he said.“He (Rajiv Gandhi) should not have dared to mingle with the crowd. But, he did,” Raut said.Targeting the Centre over night curbs in the wake of the rise in Covid-19 cases again in parts of the country, the Sena leader said the Union government has imposed such restrictions at night, resulting in financial losses.PM Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Samajwadi Party head Akhilesh Yadav address rallies which are attended by lakhs of people. But, the restrictions are only for the common man, Raut said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-cant-claim-to-be-fakir-after-rs-12-crore-car-in-his-cavalcade-sanjay-raut-357302

For them, this number was unprecedented. They were expecting a best case number of not more than 1 lakh," a source said. Such a huge number of people turning up on a non-festival day at the temple shows the immense enthusiasm among people across the country to visit the Kashi Vishwanath Dham after Modi inaugurated it, the sources noted. The local administration in Varanasi is now requesting devotees, especially VIPs, to stagger their visit to the dham to ensure proper crowd management. The prime minister had last month inaugurated the first phase of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham, a project which is spread over five lakh square feet and connects the temple premises to the River Ganga besides providing several facilities to devotees.

In India also the case trajectory is showcasing an upward trend with 16,764 cases on December 31, 2021, the highest in 70 days. Many developed nations in Europe and the US are reporting a significant rise in new cases over the past few weeks, indicating high transmissibility of the virus,” he said.“It is important to ensure timely and swift upgrade of health infrastructure across states and UTs. This becomes all the more important since with a sudden increase in cases we may start seeing a stressed health infrastructure,” Bhushan added.The ministry asked states and UTs to initiate the creation of field and makeshift hospitals to address a potential surge in cases and engage the DRDO, CSIR, private sector, corporations and NGOs for the purpose.The health secretary also said states must consider leveraging hotel rooms and other accommodations linked with Covid hospitals in the private and government sectors to cater to patients with mild to moderate symptoms as was done during the previous waves.To prevent surge pricing of essential health services such as ambulances and oxygen during the second wave, Bhushan told states to ensure the availability of beds, medical oxygen and ventilators, besides setting up control rooms at the district and ward levels to guide people on how to access ambulances and beds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/deploy-field-hospitals-centre-to-states-as-daily-cases-at-87-day-high-357119

The senior Supreme Court Judge was speaking online during an event held here to inaugurate the e-filing, paperless court and e-office projects of the Kerala HC.Launching the e-filing modules for the HC, Justice Chandrachud, who is also chairperson of the e-committee of the SC, urged the CM to ensure that the state now makes it mandatory to provide for e-filing in all litigation which is initiated by the state.“Our initiatives today at the Kerala HC emphasise the need to deliver e-services at the doorstep of all our citizens. In other words, the court is yet another service which is provided by the state to all its citizens. These initiatives are an important step in the decentralisation of justice,” he said.He said e-filing reduces the burden of travel faced by the litigants and members of the Bar to courts by instead allowing them to upload documents from the comfort of their homes or their offices.“However, it is important to acknowledge that not everyone may have access to the necessary technological apparatus, a high-speed internet or even the necessary digital literacy to conduct e-filing,” he said. “Kerala is a remarkable example in terms of the spread of literacy and education and I do believe that hand-in-hand with the initiative which we are taking up today, we must ensure 100% computer literacy between all advocates and all litigants who come to our courts seeking access to justice,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/court-is-a-service-provided-by-state-to-all-citizens-sc-judge-357125

02-01-2022||London||UK planning to offer cheaper, easier visas to clinch trade deal with India: Report||The UK is planning to relax immigration rules by offering cheaper and easier visas for Indian tourists, students and professionals, in an attempt to clinch a trade deal with India, a media report said on Saturday.UK International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan is expected to travel to New Delhi this month, when formal negotiations on a proposed India-UK free trade agreement (FTA) are expected to begin.Trevelyan is expected to use this visit to open the prospect of relaxing immigration rules for Indian citizens, a key demand from New Delhi, The Times newspaper reported.While she has the backing of Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, who has put securing closer ties with India on top of the government’s agenda to counter the growing influence of China, Home Secretary Priti Patel is opposed to this move, the report said.In May last year, Patel had signed a ‘bespoke’ and reciprocal Migration and Mobility Partnership (MMP) with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to have around 3,000 students and professionals a year access work experience benefits in either country.Under the MMP, both sides have agreed to work towards an April 2022 timeline to bring the new system in place, with work underway in the High Commission in London and the Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi.However, under further immigration plans reportedly in the works, one option being looked at is a scheme similar to that agreed as part of the UK’s FTA with Australia, which would allow young Indians the chance to come and work in the UK for up to three years.Another option would be to cut visa fees for students, thereby allowing them to stay in the UK for a period after they graduate, possibly building upon the Graduate Route visa under the points-based immigration rules currently in place, the report said.There could also be reductions in the fees for work and tourism visas.At present, it can cost an Indian citizen up to GBP 1,400 for a work visa, while students pay GBP 348 and tourists GBP 95 respectively.These are in sharp contrast with visa fees for countries such as China, who have to pay significantly less.Indian-origin peer Lord Karan Bilimoria, the president of the Confederation of British Industry, has been among the most vocal advocates for lowering visa fees for Indians.“That FTA, I hope, will benefit in enhancing bilateral trade and be as comprehensive as possible. Movement of people; reduction of duties and tariffs – the tariff on Scotch whisky is 150 per cent, that’s got to be reduced drastically; academic collaborations and cross-border research is going to be huge between our countries and partnering on a Green industrial revolution. There is a vast array to really ramp up business and trade between our two countries,” he had said.A senior government source told ‘The Times’ that there was an acceptance by ministers that the price of a trade deal with India would be to make a “generous” offer on visas.“The tech and digital space in India are still hugely protectionist and if we could open up even a slither of access, it would put us ahead in the game,” a government official was quoted as saying.The UK government has repeatedly said it wants a deal that slashes barriers for doing business with India.According to the Department for International Trade, preparations for the launch of negotiations for the UK-India FTA ‘remains underway’ since the conclusion of bilateral working groups.Trevelyan and her Indian counterpart, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, had also held talks during the G-20 trade ministers meeting in Sorrento, Italy, last October to discuss “final preparations” for the launch of India-UK FTA negotiations this year.“We look forward to launching negotiations early this year. India is projected to become the world’s third largest economy by 2050, and a trade deal will open huge opportunities for UK businesses to trade with India’s GBP 2 trillion economy,” a UK government spokesperson said.
