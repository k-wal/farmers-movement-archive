Our journey began on January 1st, 1998 and since then we have been committed in our efforts towards serving people and ensuring their welfare,” she said on Twitter.Banerjee, the stormy petrel of West Bengal politics, led her TMC to an emphatic victory in the 2021 assembly elections and became the CM for the third consecutive term.   “As we step into yet another year, let us promise to stay united in our fight against all injustices. Let us treat each other with kindness and respect. Let us work towards strengthening the federal structure of this nation. I thank you all for your blessings,” she wrote on the microblogging site.Born out of the womb of the Congress in 1998, the TMC, after two unsuccessful attempts in 2001 and 2006, came to power by defeating the mighty Left Front regime in 2011, riding the crest of massive public outrage against the communists.

01-01-2022||New Delhi||Indian, Chinese troops exchange sweets at border posts along Line of Actual Control||India and Chinese troops on Saturday exchanged sweets and greetings at several border posts along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) including in eastern Ladakh to mark the New Year, officials said.The gesture by both sides came in the midst of an over 18-month long standoff between the two sides in several friction points in eastern Ladakh.The border posts where the two sides exchanged sweets and greetings are Hot Springs and Demchok in eastern Ladakh and Nathula and Kongra La in North Sikkim, the officials said.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5, 2020, following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas.Both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process last year in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake and in the Gogra area.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.The 13th round of Corps Commander-level military talks in October ended in a stalemate with the Indian Army saying that the “constructive suggestions” made by it were not agreeable to the Chinese side.The defence ministry on Friday said it held several rounds of military talks with the Chinese side to deescalate the situation in eastern Ladakh without compromising on its stand of ‘complete disengagement and immediate restoration of status quo ante’.India has been insisting on returning to the status quo that existed before the face-off took place in early May 2020.

01-01-2022||Guwahati||‘Positive’ development on AFSPA in Assam, Nagaland soon: Himanta Biswa||Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma Saturday said “some positive development” could be expected during the year with regard to Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) in the state where militancy is on the wane. Sarma, a senior BJP leader of the North East, said “certain positive development” regarding the Act will take place soon in neighbouring Nagaland, where too it is in force.With militancy on the wane the Army has virtually withdrawn from Assam, except from five-six districts and when AFSPA comes up for renewal after four months the state government will take a “pragmatic decision”, he said.AFSPA has often been termed as “draconian” by political parties of the northeast because of the special powers it grants to the Indian Armed Forces to maintain public order in “disturbed areas” and its withdrawal has been demanded by civil society groups and rights activists.It was imposed in Assam in November 1990 and has been extended every six months since then after a review by the state government.“As far as AFSPA is concerned, Assam will see some rationalising in 2022 ... How and when we don’t know. But I am an optimistic man. We are looking at 2022 as a year of hope. There will be some positive moments regarding the Act,” Sarma told reporters here.On the continuation of AFSPA in Nagaland, he said the Centre has already formed a committee to look into the matter.“The committee will submit its report in 45 days and I am hopeful there will be certain positive development,” he added.The Centre had on December 26 constituted a high-level committee headed by a secretary rank officer to examine the possibility of lifting the controversial AFSPA in Nagaland, apparently to soothe the rising tension in the northeastern state over the killing of 14 civilians.The committee was set up three days after Union Home Minister Amit Shah held a meeting with Sarma and his Nagaland counterpart Neiphiu Rio.The demand for repeal of AFSPA from the north east came to the fore in December last year after 13 civilians were gunned down by the Army in a botched anti-insurgency operation in Nagaland and another person was killed in subsequent violence. The demand was made to the Centre even by the chief ministers of Nagaland and Meghalaya.The Act is in force in Manipur (excluding Imphal Municipal Council Area), in Changlang, Longding and Tirap districts of Arunachal Pradesh and areas falling within the jurisdiction of eight police stations of its districts bordering Assam, besides Nagaland and Assam. It was extended by six months in Nagaland by the Centre earlier this week.Sarma said tribal insurgency is almost over in Assam and credited the civil society organisations and students bodies for it.“The era of tribal militancy is over. All militant groups, but the ULFA have come overground and deposited arms ... Our last hurdle is ULFA(I),” he said.“The tribals are now firm on standing against insurgency. There won’t be any resurgence of militancy among them if we do not inflict any injustice on them,” the chief minister said.Sarma said he has learnt from his personal interactions with people who are directly or indirectly in touch with ULFA(I) chief, Paresh Barua that the militant leader wants a negotiated settlement like the government.“The stumbling block is ‘sovereignty’. ULFA(I) will want discussion over it, which we cannot hold. We are working on breaking the deadlock,” he said.The unilateral ceasefire called by ULFA(I) in response to his call for peace after assuming office in May last year is a positive step. The Assam government reciprocated by not engaging in any “direct conflict” with the outfit in the last eight months, Sarma said.“But if we get information that people are trying to join ULFA(I) or its members are demanding money from the people then as the government we have to interve ne,” he added.

He took off from Sulur in the Mi-17V5 chopper at around 1148 am for Wellington.The chopper crashed around 1222 pm.Air Marshal Singh, currently heading the Bengaluru-headquartered Training Command of the IAF, is known to be one of the best” available air crash investigators in the country.                       Before taking the reins of the Training Command, the Air Marshal was the Director-General (Inspection and Safety) at the Air headquarters and developed various protocols for flight safety while serving in the post.

01-01-2022||New Delhi||Over 1 lakh 10-year-old diesel vehicles deregistered in Delhi||Over one lakh 10-year-old diesel vehicles were deregistered by the Delhi government on Saturday, leaving their owners with options of either retrofitting them with electric kits or selling them in other states after getting a no objection certificate, officials said.A senior Delhi transport department officer said that petrol vehicles older than 15 years will also be deregistered in the coming days.The number of such old petrol vehicles is estimated to be over 43 lakh, including 32 lakh two wheelers and 11 lakh cars, he said.The transport department has warned that if any deregistered 10-year-old diesel vehicle or petrol vehicle older than 15 years is found plying on roads, it will be impounded and sent for scrapping.Owners of 10-year-old diesel vehicles have now the option to retrofit them with electric kits or sell them in other states after obtaining a no objection certificate (NOC) from the transport department, the officials said.“In compliance of the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) direction, the Delhi government has deregistered 1,01,247 diesel vehicles that completed 10 years on January 1, 2022. Owners of such vehicles can apply online for NOC if they want re-registration in other states,” said the officer said.The deregistered diesel vehicles include around 87,000 cars, and the rest include goods carriers, buses and tractors.The transport department has empanelled eight electric kit manufacturers for retrofitting old petrol and diesel vehicles, including two and three wheelers, that cannot ply on the roads due to the NGT directions.The department is also in talks with other manufacturers of electric kits and more will be empanelled in the coming days, the officials said.                            Automobile experts said that retrofitting of old diesel and petrol cars and four-wheelers will cost Rs 3-5 lakh depending on battery capacity and range.The retrofitting of two and three wheelers will cost lesser depending on type of battery and manufacturers, they said.The empanelled electric kit of Etrio Automobile can be used for both petrol and diesel four wheelers. It comprises a 17.3 kW battery with a range of over 106 km.The other empanelled manufacturers are 3EV Industries, Booma Innovative Transport Solutions Renewable, Zero 21 Renewable Energy Solutions, VELEV Motors India Pvt Ltd. All these manufacturers have electric kits with different battery capacity for two, three and four wheeled vehicles, the officials said.The kit for petrol two wheelers manufactured by Booma comes with a battery capacity of 2.016 kW and range of 65.86 km.“The cost of electric kit depends on the range. We are currently providing kits for selected model of two wheelers. By March, we will roll out kits for all models of 100 cc to 150 cc motorcycles. The kit costs around Rs 90,000, if a range of 100 km per single charge is desired,” said Srikant Shinde, CEO of GoGo A 1 Motors, which is empanelled by the department.A transport department circular issued on December 29, said all departments, public sector units and autonomous bodies of the central government and the Delhi government have been advised scrapping or retrofitting deregistered vehicles owned by them.In another order, the department has relaxed the Aadhaar Card authentication for seeking NOC to transfer deregistered vehicles, in case of foreign nationals like those working in embassies and high commissions and MNC workers, and Indian citizens living abroad.The NOC issued by the department will not be for the places which are identified by states as restricted area for reregistration.The NGT had directed the states to identify areas where the dispersion of the air is higher and vehicular density is least.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/over-1-lakh-10-year-old-diesel-vehicles-deregistered-in-delhi-356931

01-01-2022||Virudhunagar (TN)||4 killed, 8 injured in explosion at fireworks unit in Tamil Nadu||Four workers were killed and eight others injured in an explosion at a fireworks unit on Saturday at a village near here, police said.The accident occurred soon after workers reported for work at the firecrackers manufacturing unit and it is yet to be ascertained if the blast and resultant blaze were due to inappropriate handling of chemical compounds or not.Quoting a complaint from a village official and preliminary probe, police said according to a version, explosion occurred as soon as the door of a chemical storage facility was opened. However, there is also a claim that it could be only due to improper mixing of explosives.As all the four men who were assigned to work at the specific work place, a small building that witnessed the explosion were dead, enquiries with those injured and completion of probe would help piece together the sequence of events and establish the cause, a local police official, who is part of the investigation team, told PTI.A top Virudhunagar District official said improper mixing of chemicals may have been the cause of accident. However, it is yet to be confirmed, he said.The mishap occurred at a very interior area, Mettupatti Kammakarai, falling under Nagalapuram village of Virudhunagar district, the police official said.Three workers died on the spot and another succumbed to his injuries later at a hospital.Following the explosion, the building collapsed and eight others who were nearby and tasked to carry out specific manufacturing processes were injured.A case has been registered and a probe is on.Virudhunagar District in Tamil Nadu, including Sivakasi and its nearby villages, is home to a large number of fireworks manufacturing units.Several mishaps have been reported in previous years, including an accident at Achankulam village in 2020 when over 16 people were killed.

The decision may be put off by another month till the elections are over. Once the elections are over, the tax will be increased," he said.The Congress spokesperson said footwear, hiring taxis and auto-rickshaws using ride-hailing apps, ordering food using food delivery apps, drawing kits for children and withdrawing cash from ATMs had become costlier from January 1 due to increase in taxes.Surjewala said the prices of tea, pulses, edible oil, cooking gas and even salt had increased since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014."Remember, if Modi is there, price rise will stay. The Modi government means high prices. Modi and inflation are harmful for the country," Surjewala said, urging voters to defeat the BJP in the coming elections.He said the government was increasing taxes even before the budget was presented and could claim later to have presented a "tax-free budget".

Patient care was affected at several major hospitals in Delhi in this period as resident doctors were boycotting services to lodge their protest.Their primary demand from the Centre was expediting of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Postgraduate) or NEET-PG counselling process.In its statement, FORDA claimed that the Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya has agreed upon some key points in connection with the agitation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/resident-doctors-call-off-strike-resume-work-356707
01-01-2022||Shubhadeep Choudhury||When Left wanted BJP to win West Bengal election||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 31The year 2021 brought out the desperation of the Left in West Bengal. Left supporters, especially those aligned to the CPM, prayed for BJP’s victory in the Assembly elections held in March-April 2021. Outlandish though it may sound, it is true.It was of course clear as daylight that there was absolutely no possibility of Left Front candidates making any impact on the election scene.Left candidates had drawn a blank in the state in the Lok Sabha elections held in 2019. After TMC’s triumphant return to power in the state, BJP supporters had to bear the brunt of violence with many of them fleeing away from the state to escape the TMC hordes. Left supporters were also deeply upset by the TMC’s victory. They grieved in silence and the gloomy mood persisted for a while.“The CPM has visceral hatred for Mamata. They simply cannot forget that 34 years of Left Front rule in the state was brought to an end by her,” says Baharuddin, Kolkata-based, senior journalist.Dipankar Bhattacharya, general secretary of CPI-ML (Liberation), had correctly understood the reason for CPM’s hostility toward the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC). He had appealed to the Left Front to forget Nandigram and Singur and strengthen the fight against the BJP by supporting the TMC. The CPM ignored Bhattacharya’s appeal. In social media posts, some of CPM’s supporters started wondering whether the road that had started in Naxalbari was ending up at Kalighat (the Kolkata neighbourhood where Mamata Banerjee lives). Mamata was part of the AB Vajpayee-led government at the Centre for a while. This is cited by the CPM to claim that Mamata had paved the way for the BJP to make inroads in Bengal.CPM’s strong feelings against Mamata had come to the fore during the 2016 Assembly elections also when the CPM extended support to the candidates of BJP-ally Bimal Gurung-led Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) candidates in Darjeeling district against the TMC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/when-left-wanted-bjp-to-win-west-bengal-election-356708
01-01-2022||Satya Prakash||Gender justice: Supreme Court played on front foot to set things right||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 31From appointing a record number of women judges in the top court to reversing the Bombay High Court’s controversial “skin-to-skin” verdict, the year gone by witnessed the Supreme Court (SC) playing an active role in setting things right on the gender justice front.For the first time in the history of the SC, nine judges, including three women, were administered oath of office on August 31, taking the top court’s strength to 33 against a sanctioned strength of 34. Also, for the first time the top court has four women sitting judges.The appointment of three woman judges — Justice Hima Kohli, Justice BV Nagarathna and Justice Bela M Trivedi — is quite important as one of them (Justice Nagarathna) is in line to become the first woman CJI in September 2027, if the line of succession isn’t disturbed.Representation of women in the judiciary is expected to increase further. “Enough of suppression for thousands of years. It’s high time we have 50 per cent representation for women in the judiciary. It’s your right. It’s not a matter of charity,” the CJI said at a function.Holding that direct “skin-to-skin” contact is not essential to constituting an offence under the POCSO Act, the Supreme Court on November 18 set aside the Bombay High Court’s controversial verdict acquitting two men accused of groping a minor girl, saying, “Restricting the interpretation of the words ‘touch’ or ‘physical contact’ to ‘skin-to-skin contact’ would lead to an absurd interpretation of the POCSO Act.” Justice Pushpa Ganediwala, who had delivered the controversial judgment, has not been given any extension or confirmation so far even though her tenure as an additional judge is due to expire in February 2022.Acting on a PIL filed by nine women lawyers, the Supreme Court on March 18 set aside a Madhya Pradesh High Court order that required a molestation accused to get a ‘Rakhi’ tied from the victim as a condition for grant of bail, saying it “reflects adversely on the entire judicial system of the country”.CJI for women’s representationHighlighting under representation of women in the judiciary, CJI NV Ramana on September 26 exhorted women lawyers to strongly demand 50 per cent representation and assured them of his “total support” to address the problem of gender gap in the field of law.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gender-justice-supreme-court-played-on-front-foot-to-set-things-right-356709

The claim of such expenses does not seem to be appropriate in light of the facts and evidence gathered during the search action,” the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the policy-making body for the I-T Department, claimed in an official statement issued here.It did not identify the entities searched.The raids “brought out the modus operandi of purchase of the components for manufacturing of mobile handsets”. “It is gathered that both these companies had not complied with the regulatory mandate prescribed under the Income Tax Act for disclosure of transactions with associated enterprises,” the statement said.Such a lapse, it said, makes them liable for penal action under the I-T Act and the quantum could be more than Rs 1,000 crore.A modus operandi was detected “whereby foreign funds have been introduced in the books of the Indian company but it transpires that the source from which such funds have been received are of doubtful nature, purportedly with no creditworthiness of the lender”.“The quantum of such borrowings is about Rs 5,000 crore, on which interest expenses have also been claimed,” it said.The CBDT said “evidence with regard to the inflation of expenses, payments on behalf of the associated enterprises, etc. have also been noticed which led to the reduction of taxable profits of the Indian mobile handset manufacturing company”. “Such amount could be in excess of Rs 1,400 crore,” it said. The statement claimed one of the companies raided had utilised the services of another entity located in India but did not comply with the provisions of tax deduction at source introduced from April 2020. — PTISearches conducted on Dec 21On December 21, searches were carried out in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Assam, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Bihar, Rajasthan and Delhi-NCR.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tax-evasion-worth-crores-detected-after-raids-on-foreign-run-firms-356757

The ministry said in view of the current upsurge of Covid-19 cases, any individual with fever (with/without cough), headache, sore throat, breathlessness, bodyache, recent loss of taste or smell, fatigue and diarrhea should be considered as suspect case of Covid-19 unless proven otherwise by confirmation of another etiology.While awaiting the test results, they should be advised to immediately isolate themselves and follow the home isolation guidelines.According to the Health Ministry, RTPCR testing leads to delays in confirming diagnosis due to its turnaround time of about 5-8 hours. “Therefore, you are encouraged to increase testing by widespread use of rapid antigen tests (RATs) in such specific situations,” the letter asked the recipients.States and UTs must set up multiple RAT booths in identified geographies and keep them operational on 24X7 basis to offer widespread testing access to all citizens. RATs may be allowed at all government and private health care facilities down to the primary health centre level, the letter stated.The letter also suggested use of self-tests/home tests for symptomatic individuals.16,764 FRESH CASESTOTAL DEATHS 4,81,080 ACTIVE CASES 91,361 R’than man dies after Omicron infectionJaipur: A 73-year-old man, who was found infected with the Omicron variant in genome sequencing and later tested negative twice, died in a Udaipur hospital on Friday. “The death is due to post-Covid pneumonia with comorbidities — diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypothyroidism,” Udaipur Chief Medical Health Officer Dr Dinesh Kharadi said.

It has been China’s territory since ancient times. Zhao Lijian, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman*China refers AP as ZangnanThe Chinese reaction came after India on Thursday had strongly rejected China renaming 15 places in Arunachal Pradesh and asserted it has “always been” and will “always be” an integral part of India and that assigning “invented” names does not alter this fact.“We have seen such. This is not the first time China has attempted such renaming of places in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. China had also sought to assign such names in April 2017,” External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said on Thursday.“Arunachal Pradesh has always been, and will always be an integral part of India. Assigning invented names to places in Arunachal Pradesh does not alter this fact,” he had added.Asked to react to this statement, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a media briefing here that, “for standardised management of the area, the competent authorities in China in accordance with relevant regulations have published the names for the relevant area. These are matters that are within China’s sovereignty”.Zhao said, “Zangnan (the southern part of China’s Tibet) is located in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. It has been China’s territory since the ancient times.”China refers Arunachal Pradesh as Zangnan.Earlier, Zhao said “the southern part of Tibet belongs to the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China and it has been China’s inherent territories”.This is the second time China has sought to Sinicise the names of places in Arunachal Pradesh released by China. It had renamed six to seven places in 2017. While that renaming was attributed to Dalai Lama’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh, this time it is being linked with the military standoff in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-reacts-says-arunachal-inherent-part-of-its-territory-356748

Currently, the tax rate on manmade fibre (MMF) is 18 per cent, MMF yarn 12 per cent and fabrics 5 per cent. “The textile industry felt there could be a temptation not to come into the formalised system. The immediate pressure could mean that some may go into the informal way of doing business,” said Sitharaman. A group of state finance ministers, looking at the GST rate rationalisation, will now examine this issue. It has been asked to submit its report to the council by February. Sitharaman said a similar demand for footwear was not accepted. From January 1, all footwear, irrespective of prices, will be taxed at a uniform rate of 12%.Vivek Jalan, partner, Tax Connect Advisory, said GST hike on textiles would have been detrimental to almost one crore wholesalers and retailers.New tax rate on textiles by Feb||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gst-hike-shoes-to-pinch-textiles-spared-356739
01-01-2022||Vibha Sharma||BJP, SP trade charges amid income tax raids in UP||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 31A massive war of words erupted today in the poll-bound Uttar Pradesh following income tax raids on Samajwadi Party legislator and perfume maker Pushpraj Jain in Kannauj.While the Samajwadi Party is accusing the ruling BJP of “misusing” Central agencies, saffron party leaders are using the development to take a swipe at Akhilesh Yadav, their main rival in the state. Home Minister Amit Shah, who was in Ayodhya to take stock of the ongoing work at Ram Temple, said the stench of the Samajwadi perfume had spread all over UP. “They (SP) are getting worried over the raids,” Shah said addressing a public rally. Throwing a question at the audience, he asked: “Do you have any issues if people with black money are being raided?”Seized Rs 200 crore not bjp’s, says FMIt is not BJP’s money. How do they (Opposition) know whose money is it? Are they partners (with him)? Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance MinisterAkhilesh Yadav had recently launched a perfume called “Samajwadi Itra” prepared by MLC Pushpraj Jain, whose premises were raided today. Completely backing Pushpraj Jain, the Samajwadi Party is claiming that the BJP has gone after the “real target” after “mistakenly” raiding “their own man” Piyush Jain a couple of days ago.“Today’s raids were done out of frustration to set right the earlier mistake, wherein a BJP supporter (Piyush) was mistaken for an SP man,” said Akhilesh, dubbing the action as an “open misuse of Central agencies by a scared BJP”. However, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the nearly Rs 200- crore cash recovered from Piyush was not BJP money. She also defended the timing of the tax raids, saying law-enforcing agencies act on actionable intelligence. “It is not BJP money,” she told reporters when confronted with the allegation that the Rs 197.49-crore cash recovered from Piyush was BJP money and the tax authorities had raided him by “mistake” and were now targeting Pushpraj, their “original target”.She rejected the Opposition charge that the wrong Jain was raided, saying, “How do they know whose money is it? Are they partners (with him)?... Only if you are running a business in partnership with someone would you know.”Dismissing the charge of the raids being “politically motivated”, she asked if the raiding parties returned empty-handed.The Income Tax Department today raided multiple premises linked to perfume traders and some other businesses in Uttar Pradesh as part of a tax-evasion investigation.Political war hots UP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-sp-trade-charges-amid-i-t-raids-in-up-356738
