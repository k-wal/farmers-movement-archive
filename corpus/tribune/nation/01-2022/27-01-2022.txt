27-01-2022||Vibha Sharma||Amit Shah woo jats and gujjars, says ‘UP elections will decide India’s destiny’||New Delhi, January 27With just about a fortnight to go before Phase-I of Uttar Pradesh polls, the war for politically significant vote bloc ‘jats’ and ‘gujjars’— who participated in the year-long agitation against the now-repealed farm laws, is intensifying in the Western UP.Home Minister Amit Shah, who was in the region today for yet another outreach, had yesterday held a meeting with leaders of the Jat community at the residence of Delhi MP Pravesh Singh. Interestingly, apart from slamming main rival Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav for “corruption, law and order”, etc., Shah also termed him an “outsider” while going all out to woo his ally, RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary.Breathing fire against the SP and Mayawati-led BSP, his “soft” approach towards Jayant was unmissable, even today in Mathura, leading to widespread speculations about “possibilities” which yesterday BJP MP Parvesh Verma had also hinted at.Significantly, Shah yesterday urged Jat leaders assembled at the residence of Verma “why do you bring outsiders in a fight within the house”. He also said “Jayant has chosen the wrong house this time” while pointing that “ideology of both the BJP and Jats is the same as both keep national interest first and have been fight against invaders”.Though Chaudhary has rejected the offer, terming it an “election tactic”, Shah’s move set the cat among the pigeons with rivals sensing red, calling it an “underhand attempt to confuse the voters”.The subtle messaging has set the buzz on the future possibilities, including post-poll alliances, while highlighting the BJP’s apprehensions on the around 158 seats of Western UP in the 403-member Assembly.On his part, Jayant today again rejected the offer saying that the BJP needs to fulfil “promises to farmers and also stop the politics of polarisation”.Making clear that he has absolutely no intention to deviate, Jayant said “main koi chavanni nhi hoon ke palat jaun, ye mann samman ki ladai hai”.Akhilesh and Jayant will also hold a joint press conference tomorrow, Friday, in Muzaffarnagar, where they are expected to take on the BJP on its latest strategy.Responding to Verma’s invite that “BJP’s doors are always open” to him, Jayant yesterday had taken to the social media to slam it and to “instead send invitations to the 700 farmers’ families who lost their dear ones during the protests”.“People of the Jat community will speak to Jayant. BJP’s doors are always open for him. We also suggested that people of the Jat community to talk to Jayant,” Verma had said after the meeting. Expressing gratitude to Jats for always supporting the BJP, Shah also claimed that no one, except Prime Minister Narendra Modi, gave respect to farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait, the father of BKU leader Rakesh Tikait. Again, today while he slamming the BSP and the SP, he did not say a word against Jayant.Notably the BJP has been raising issues related to law and order and Muzaffarnagar riots during the Akhilesh rule, the grand Ram Temple during the BJP regime and Jat reservation in Western UP, to woo the crucial vote block. Addressing the ‘Effective Voter Communication’ program in Mathura, Shah said “the BJP drew a map for complete development of Uttar Pradesh. Only after Prime Minister Modi took charge and Yogi Adityanath became the Chief Minister, the mantra of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ was implemented.“BJP is not the party for one caste but for the entire society,” Shah said, thanking the people of the Braj for always choosing lotus (BJP)”. “UP elections will decide India’s destiny,” he said.Jats are an important factor in almost all the seats in the region where the RLD enjoys influence. Opposition SP and RLD have been trying to revive ‘MAJGAR’, the caste combination of Muslim, Ahir (Yadav), Jat, Gujjar and Rajput which suffered a major dent following the 2013-Muzaffarnagar violence.                                     #UPPolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-shah-woo-jats-and-gujjars-says-up-elections-will-decide-indias-destiny-364744

This was to be an in-person interaction unlike their virtual summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping two days back. But rising Omicron cases led to the cancellation of their Delhi visit during which they would have been Chief Guests on Republic Day.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as the host, sought to set an ambitious agenda by suggesting a road map for the next 30 years on connectivity and cooperation in an integrated manner, said MEA’s Secretary (West) Reenat Sandhu while briefing the media at the end of the one and a half hour meeting that figured all the five Central Asian Presidents and PM Modi. The Joint Declaration issued after the summit also identified health as another area of cooperation with the Presidents keen on leading Indian hospital chains expanding their footprint.An important outcome of the meeting was the agreement to hold the summit once every two years. One of the key proposals by the Prime Minister was to institutionalise the framework for India-Central Asia cooperation at the regional level through line-level Ministerial meetings to strengthen cooperation in political and developmental partnership, trade and connectivity, culture and tourism, and security, said Sandhu.PM Modi suggested that an India Central Asia centre to serve as a secretariat could be set up here.Speaking at the summit, PM Modi said the interaction had three main objectives. First, to make it clear that cooperation between India and Central Asia was essential for regional security. The second was to establish a framework of regular interactions. The final objective was to create a roadmap for cooperation through an integrated approach.In the Joint Declaration, the two sides decided to set up joint working groups (JWG) in several areas to push forward cooperation. The MEA Secretary singled out the JWG to promote connectivity between South Asia and Central Asia via Iran’s Chabahar port.Sandhu said the Summit was the culmination of sustained diplomatic engagement with Central Asian countries in recent years. There was a candid exchange of views on regional and international issues, especially the current regional security situation, she added.                                     #CentralAsia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-central-asia-set-up-template-for-closer-ties-summit-to-be-held-every-two-years-364737
27-01-2022||Beijing||China says latest round of talks with India on border issue ‘positive and constructive’||China on Thursday described as “positive and constructive” the latest round of military-level talks with India and said Beijing will work closely with New Delhi to “properly handle” the border issue even as it refuted the US allegation of “intimidating” neighbours.India and China held the 14th round of Corps Commander-level meeting on January 12 during which the two sides agreed to maintain dialogue through military and diplomatic channels to work out a “mutually acceptable resolution” of the remaining issues of the standoff at eastern Ladakh.“The Chinese side believed this round of talks were positive and constructive, and China will work closely with the Indian side to properly handle the border issue through negotiation and consultation,” said Senior Colonel Wu Qian, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of National Defence said in response to a question.Ahead of the talks, Indian officials expressed hope of resolving issues related to disengagement at Patrolling Point 15 (Hot Springs) in eastern Ladakh in the 14th round of talks.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5, 2020, following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process last year in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake and in the Gogra area.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.Sr. Col. Wu in his press briefing on Thursday sharply criticised White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki’s comments accusing China of attempting to intimidate its neighbours ahead of the India-China military talks.Responding to a question on China’s aggressive behaviour on the border with India, Psaki said on January 12 that the United States continues to monitor the situation.“We continue to closely monitor the situation. We continue to support dialogue and peaceful resolution of these border disputes,” she said.“We’ve been pretty clear how we view Beijing’s behaviour in the region around the world. We believe it can be destabilising, and we’re concerned by the PRC’s (People Republic of China) attempt to intimidate its neighbours,” she said.“We’ll continue to stand with our partners on that,” Psaki underlined.Reacting to Psaki’s remarks, Sr. Col. Wu said some American politicians are so fond of using the word “coerce” and they seem to have forgotten that the US is the inventor and master player of “coercive diplomacy”.“The China-India border issue is a matter between the two countries, and both sides oppose the interference from a third party,” Wu was quoted as saying by Chinese Defence Ministry’s official website.He reaffirmed China’s clear-cut position that China neither “coerces” nor is “coerced” by others, and strongly opposes the US forcing “coercive diplomacy” on other countries, the report said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-says-latest-round-of-talks-with-india-on-border-issue-positive-and-constructive-364735
27-01-2022||New Delhi||1984 anti-Sikh riots: HC asks SIT to respond to plea for action against Congress leader Kamal Nath||The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked the SIT to file a status report on a plea seeking action against Congress leader Kamal Nath for his alleged role in a case relating to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.Justice Subramonium Prasad issued notice to the Special Investigation Team (SIT), set up by the Union Home Ministry, on the petition filed by BJP’s Manjinder Singh Sirsa.The court listed the matter for further hearing on March 28.In a statement, Sirsa said “it has been more than 37 years since the Sikh community is awaiting justice in these (anti-Sikh riots) cases. Though some success was achieved with the sentencing of Sajjan Kumar (Congress leader) to life imprisonment but still much more it to be done as other guilty Kamal Nath and other Congressmen are yet to be tried and sentenced”.He added, “Today’s decision of the high court has rekindled a hope in the community that every guilty will get punishment for his sins.”  Sirsa, in his petition before the high court, sought direction to the SIT to take action against Nath in the FIR lodged in 1984 at Parliament Street police station here in which five persons were named as accused in the case and were allegedly accommodated at Congress leader’s house.Those accused were discharged due to a lack of evidence. However, Nath was never named in the FIR.Sirsa in the petition has sought a direction that Nath be arrested without further delay.Sirsa was represented through senior advocate Maninder Singh and lawyer Gurbaksh Singh.The case is related to a mob of rioters storming the Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib here.Nath had previously denied the charges.The SIT, in September 2019, had decided to reopen seven anti-Sikh riot cases, where the accused were either acquitted or the trial was closed.After the notification had become public, Sirsa had claimed that former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath had allegedly given shelter to five people who were accused in one of the seven cases.“Nath was never named in the FIR registered in New Delhi’s Parliament Street police station. Five persons named as accused in the case (FIR No. 601/84) were accommodated in Nath’s residence. All these accused were discharged due to a lack of evidence.“Since the SIT will reinvestigate this case also, two witnesses will appear before the SIT where they will tell about Kamal Nath’s role in the riots,” Sirsa had said.According to the Home Ministry’s 2019 notification, the SIT has taken up the discharged cases for scrutiny or preliminary enquiry.The seven anti-Sikh riot cases were registered in 1984 at police stations in Vasant Vihar, Sun Light Colony, Kalyanpuri, Parliament Street, Connaught Place, Patel Nagar, and Shahdara.The SIT had issued public notices asking individuals and organisations to provide information related to the seven cases.Sirsa had claimed that Kamal Nath’s name was never included in the FIR nor was he investigated by the police.The SIT was set up on February 12, 2015, following a recommendation by the Home Ministry-appointed Justice (retd) G P Mathur committee.The three-member SIT comprises two Inspector General-rank IPS officers and a judicial officer.The anti-Sikh riots had broken following the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Gandhi was shot dead by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31, 1984.—||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1984-anti-sikh-riots-hc-asks-sit-to-respond-to-plea-for-action-against-congress-leader-kamal-nath-364733
27-01-2022||Guwahati||246 militants surrender; two Barak Valley outfits to lay down arms in February: Himanta||A total of 246 militants of United Gorkha People’s Organisation (UGPO) and Tiwa Liberation Army (TLA) formally surrendered before Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma here on Thursday.Welcoming the 169 UGPO and 77 TLA insurgents into the mainstream, Sarma said two more Bru-Reang militant outfits in the Barak Valley will lay down arms in February.Speaking at a formal arms-laying ceremony, the chief minister said that United Liberation Front of Assam (Independent) and Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) will then be the only remaining active insurgent groups in the state.“Two Bru-Reang groups in the Barak Valley will surrender in the coming days. We will try to complete the process and settle them by February,” he said.A senior police officer, who is involved in the surrender process of the militants, told PTI that the chief minister referred to the Bru Revolutionary Army Union (BRAU) and United Democratic Liberation Front (UDLF).The UGPO and TLA militants deposited 277 firearms of various types, 720 cartridges and grenades in front of Sarma.UGPO was formed in 2007 and was active mainly in Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa and Biswanath districts, although it also had a presence in Bongaigaon, Kamrup, Tinsukia, Dhemaji, Udalguri and Sonitpur districts.TLA was established in 2014 and was active in Morigaon, Nagaon and West Karbi Anglong districts, while it had cadres from Kamrup Metropolitan and Karbi Anglong districts as well.Sarma hoped that ULFA(I) and KLO will also soon join the talks and bring lasting peace to the state.“The ULFA(I) did not call a bandh on Republic Day. As per reports, the KLO sought public opinion on whether they should join the peace talks. So, we believe that a positive development may come from these two groups also and Assam will have permanent peace that it has been craving for decades,” he said.The chief minister asserted that the trend of various ethnic communities forming small insurgent outfits has almost ended.“For example, we solved all the issues of the Gorkha community. So, there is no need for an armed struggle and that is why UGPO has surrendered,” he said.Sarma also distributed financial grant of Rs 1.5 lakh each to the surrendered cadres of Rava National Liberation Front (RNLF), Adivashi Dragon Fighter (ADF), National Santhal Liberation Army (NSLA), National Liberation Front of Bengali (NLFB) and United People’s Revolutionary Front (UPRF).These militant groups had laid down arms en masse before the then chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal in 2020.On Thursday, 28 cadres of RNLF, 61 of ADF, 41 of NSLA, 303 of NLFB and 29 of UPRF were offered financial support to create livelihood opportunities.Sarma said that the government is aiming to rehabilitate all surrendered militants by May 10 and make them an integral part of the society.“The surrendered militants must engage in entrepreneurship and agriculture to lead a dignified life and make meaningful contributions to Assam’s progress. They have to utilise the financial grant judiciously for livelihood and generating employment.“We are embracing the misguided youths, who have returned home, and expect them to utilise their vigour and strength to build a strong Assam,” he said.Sarma added that the government will felicitate those who become successful in their new lives in generating employment opportunities and helping in the state’s economic progress so that they become examples for others.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/246-militants-surrender-two-barak-valley-outfits-to-lay-down-arms-in-february-himanta-364732

Schools have been closed in most parts of the country for physical classes after the emergence of the new Omicron variant of the virus. Students have been mostly attending online classes, barring some brief periods in between, for almost two years now due to the coronavirus pandemic."As parents have been demanding for the opening of schools, the union government is working on a model for staggered opening of schools following all Covid related protocols," a highly-placed source said.A delegation of parents led by Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist and public policy specialist, and Centre for Policy Research president Yamini Aiyar, had met Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday to submit a memorandum signed by over 1,600 parents demanding that the schools be reopened.Similar demands have been made in some other states as well, though another section of parents has been favouring the continuation of online classes.The Delhi government had recommended reopening of schools in the national capital, but a decision on this was postponed till the next meeting by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Thursday.It has become necessary to prevent further damage to the social and emotional well-being of children, Sisodia had said on Wednesday.Asserting that online education can never replace offline education, Sisodia had said the government had closed schools when it was not safe for children, but excessive caution is now harming students.After being briefly reopened, schools in Delhi were again closed on December 28 last year in view of the third wave of COVID-19 driven by the Omicron variant.                                      #Covid19                                     #Omicron||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-mulls-model-for-staggered-opening-of-schools-following-all-covid-protocols-364708

27-01-2022||Palghar (Maharashtra)||Maharashtra man rides 40 kms on bike with wife carrying son's body as pillion||In a shocking development, a tribal couple rode around 40 kms on a motorcycle -- with the wife carrying their dead minor son's body -- to their village, officials said here on Thursday.The chilling incident happened late on Tuesday night when a 6-year-old boy Ajay Y. Pardhi succumbed to acute pneumonia at the government's sub-district facility, Cottage Hospital, Jawhar, around 9 p.m.After completing the hospital formalities, the distraught parents attempted to engage an ambulance to help transport their son's body back home at the remote Sadakwadi village, around 40 kms away.However, at least three ambulances available there refused to help out and the hospital authorities did not have a hearse van, usually deployed for moving bodies.Confirming the development, Cottage Hospital CMO Dr Ramdas Marad said that ambulances are generally prohibited from transporting the dead."But, I was prepared to help out the family given the late hour and the very cold weather... I summoned a private ambulance, who demanded a large sum of money which the family could not afford," Dr. Marad told IANS.He admitted that the 142-bed Cottage Hospital has no hearse van and alternative transport was not available despite all efforts.When the hospital authorities suggested they should wait till morning, the couple reportedly refused fearing that their son would be subjected to an autopsy.The medicos assured that since the boy had died of natural causes, there was no need for a post-mortem, but the couple was adamant and insisted on returning despite the numbing chill that night.Finally, just before midnight, the Pardhi couple -- Yuvraj Pardhi and his wife -- carefully wrapped up their deceased son's body in a couple of sheets, donned thick blankets themselves and left for home.They reached their tiny dwelling in the Sadakwadi village home in the wee hours of Wednesday as the 73rd Republic Day dawned all over the country.The last rites of the boy were performed on Wednesday with the entire tribal hamlet in mourning while the nation erupted in celebrations.As the incident sparked huge outrage in the district, the hospital and district health authorities ordered a probe and recommended the immediate dismissal of the three ambulance drivers, hired from a contracting firm in Palghar town, said Dr. Marad.Shramjeevi Sanghatana Founder Vivek Pandit said such incidents are not uncommon in remote tribal areas of Palghar, Nandurbar and other tribal belts which lack health facilities."This is merely one instance which has come in public glare... The situation in the farflung, forested or hilly areas is very alarming, they have no curative facilities, doctors, gynaecologists, nurses, ambulances, medicines but the government seems to be ignoring it," said Pandit, a former legislator.A health department official said the government will soon order deployment of a hearse van and an ambulance permanently at the sub-district hospital.

The Maharashtra government had assured that no coercive action would be taken against Rane till January 27 in order to enable him to approach the Supreme Court.Rane had submitted before the Bombay High Court that the FIR against him was because he had mocked Shiv Sena leader and State Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray and that the FIR was registered with the sole aim of preventing his participation in the December 30, 2021 Sindhudurg Cooperative Bank district elections.The state police contended that they had circumstantial evidence to support their case and they needed Rane’s custody to complete the probe.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-grants-10-day-protection-from-arrest-to-nitesh-rane-364686
27-01-2022||New Delhi||Rahul Gandhi's stand on social media platforms vindicated: Congress after Twitter says it is for healthy debate||The Congress on Thursday said its leader Rahul Gandhi's stand that democracy and social media platforms cannot be suppressed or subjugated by the ruling government and allowed to become a space for mere abuse and trolls stands vindicated.This came out after Twitter said it is committed to India and healthy debate on its platform.Gandhi had written to Twitter, accusing it of "unwitting complicity" in curbing free and fair speech in India and expressed serious concern over "suppressing" his Twitter account followers.Twitter, however, said the account follower numbers are “meaningful and accurate”.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said Rahul Gandhi's stand has been that social media platforms cannot be suppressed, subjugated and denigrated to trolls' space and there should instead be a healthy debate and discussion on them."The plurality, the multi-culturalism, the open debate, the critique of policies and programmes of the government and that the social media patforms should be healthy forum for debates and discussions has been the stand of Rahul Gandhi, which now stands vindicated," Surjewala told PTI.In his letter to Twitter CEO Parag Aggarwal, Gandhi had said, "I am writing to you on behalf of more than a billion Indians to not allow Twitter to become a pawn in the destruction of the idea of India."I want to bring your attention to what I believe is Twitter's unwitting complicity in curbing free and fair speech in India," Gandhi also said in his December 27 letter to Twitter.Responding to him, Twitter's vice president, Global Public Policy and Philanthropy, Sinead McSweeney has said, "Twitter is deeply committed to India" and will ensure that public conversation is healthy, which includes diverse voices, diverse points of view, allowing people to be better informed and to participate safely and comfortably.Twitter also pointed out that it does not arbitrarily censor political content and elevating political debate and open discourse is fundamental to its service and core values."We understand increased transparency is at the foundation to promote healthy public conversation on Twitter and to earn trust. We know it is critical that people understand our processes and that we are transparent about what happens as a result."We assure you that Twitter, Inc. treats its role as a platform service provider with utmost seriousness and we are deeply committed to India," McSweeney said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhis-stand-on-social-media-platforms-vindicated-congress-after-twitter-says-it-is-for-healthy-debate-364684

The cash component of the deal would come once the handover process is completed.The Tata Group would pay Rs 2,700 crore cash and take over Rs 15,300 crore of the airline's debt. The deal also includes sale of Air India Express and ground handling arm AISATS.The transaction was to be completed by December 2021, but the deadline was later extended till January 2022, owing to longer-than-expected time taken to complete procedural work.This will mark the return of Air India to the Tata fold after 67 years. The Tata Group had founded Air India as Tata Airlines in October 1932. The government nationalised the airline in 1953.As a precursor to the handover process, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) on January 24, notified the framework agreement entered into by and between Air India Ltd and AI Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL) for transfer of assets of the national carrier post it ceasing to be a public sector company.AIAHL was set up in 2019, by the government for holding debt and non-core assets of the Air India group.Four Air India subsidiaries -- Air India Air Transport Services Ltd (AIATSL), Airline Allied Services Ltd (AASL), Air India Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL) and Hotel Corporation of India Ltd (HCI) -- along with non-core assets, painting and artefacts, and other non-operational assets, was transferred to the SPV.In October last year, Tatas beat the Rs 15,100-crore offer by a consortium led by SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh and the reserve price of Rs 12,906 crore set by the government for the sale of its 100 per cent stake in the loss-making carrier.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-notifies-air-india-asset-transfer-agreement-with-aiahl-stage-set-for-ai-handover-to-tata-group-364679
27-01-2022||Sandeep Dikshit||Iran Foreign Minister to visit India at the end of this week||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 27Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian will visit New Delhi at the end of the week amidst Tehran’s talks with world powers on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and urgent diplomatic business with India.The Iranian Foreign Minister’s talks with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will give some clarity about the impact of US sanctions if some India-Iran plans are put in motion while talks on Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) are going on.In the immediate term, India would like to regularly use the Chabahar port for humanitarian relief to Afghanistan after Pakistan dragged its feet for months on the first tranche of 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Kabul. In an earlier telephonic conversation, sources here had said that Amir-Abdollahian had offered to transfer India's humanitarian including wheat and medicine aid to Afghanistan.The threat of US sanctions, however, is inhibiting many companies from participating. This could also be the case for the tri-country initiative involving Uzbekistan for a land corridor from the same port to countries in Central Asia. Once the US restores the JCPOA, a pact that was abruptly junked by the Trump administration, India could consider marshalling funds for exploration in Farzad-B gas field in Iran where there has been no forward movement for years because of the fear of sanctions on participating companies.  On the regional security side, NSAs Ajit Doval and Ali Shamkhani have been in regular touch as both countries have faced the heat from the Sunni-dominated Taliban in the past when it had hosted militant groups inimical to both countries. Shamkhani had last visited India in November to participate in the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan.Amid talks of cooperation with both Sunni Gulf monarchies and Shiite Iran, India has taken collateral damage because of their rivalry – two Indians have been killed in the UAE and seven taken hostage in Yemen. Iran backs Yemen’s Houthi rebels who had attacked UAE oil facilities in retaliation for the monarchies’ participation in the civil war in their country.  Two Indians and a Pakistani were killed in the blaze ensuing from the drone attacks. The seven Indians taken hostage were aboard a UAE ship hijacked by the Houthis who claim it was carrying war stores for their rivals.Amir-Abdollahian will then leave for Sri Lanka which needs a helping hand due to its economic crisis. Both sides have finalised a tea-for-oil pact under which Sri Lanka pays off the import of oil by exporting tea to Iran. Sri Lanka will settle $ 251 million of its oil import dues by sending $ 5 million worth of tea to Iran. The Iranian Foreign Minister’s India-Sri Lanka tour comes after his trips to Moscow and Beijing.Jaishankar was quick to call on the new Iran President Ibrahim Raisi before he was formally sworn in last year while India backed Iran’s inclusion in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Raisi then spoke of extensive economic cooperation with neighbouring countries. In separate Republic Day messages to President Ram Nath Kovind and PM Narendra Modi, Raisi expressed Tehran’s readiness to broaden relations with India and open a “new chapter in mutual cooperation”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iran-foreign-minister-to-visit-india-at-the-end-of-this-week-364674
27-01-2022||Sandeep Dikshit||PM Modi to host India's first-ever summit with Central Asian leaders later today||New Delhi, January 27Prime Minister Narendra Modi will host India’s first ever virtual summit with all five Presidents of Central Asian countries later on Thursday. The interaction at the apex level caps a concerted effort by the South Block to develop regular interaction with Central Asian states as they seek to balance the influence of Russia and China by developing ties with India, another major regional power.The five Central Asian Presidents were to attend the Republic Day celebrations as chief guests but rising omicron cases led them to opt for a virtual summit with PM Modi. The summit is a “reflection of India’s growing engagement with the Central Asian countries, which are a part of India’s extended neighbourhood”, the MEA said.Modi has visited all Central Asian countries in 2015. Subsequently, India-Central Asia Dialogue at Foreign Ministers’ level has held three meetings. Besides, Secretaries of National Security Councils of Central Asian countries participated in the Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan held in New Delhi on November 10 last year.During the first India-Central Asia Summit, the leaders are expected to exchange views on regional and international issues of interest, especially the evolving regional security situation.Some of the other major bilateral focus areas are trade and connectivity, development partnership and people-to-people contacts.Over the years, India has developed special ties with some Central Asian countries. For example, Kazakh troops participate as part of the Indian UN Peacekeeping battalion in Lebanon with the sixth such rotation currently going on. Previous Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaeyev made five visits to India including once as chief guest on Republic Day. In fact, the first overseas visit by Nazarbayev was to India after Kazakhstan, the largest Central Asian country, became independent.Kyrgyz Presidents have visited India six times while Modi visited Bishkek twice. India has set up five telemedicine centres, extended a $ 200 million line of credit, holds annual military exercises ‘Khanjar’ and has a 15,000-strong student community.Tajik Presidents have also visited India six times and strong cooperation in defence includes a military hospitaland an unacknowledged airbase. Sharing ethnicity with Panjshir Valley, Tajiks share a very similar position with India on Afghanistan.Presidents of Uzbekistan, the most populous Central Asian country, have visited India seven times while PM Modi visited Tashkent in 2015 and 2016. A recent diplomatic breakthrough was the setting up of a Secretary-level India-Uzbek-Iran trilateral Working Group on Chabahar port, days after Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev had floated the proposal when he interacted with Modi in December 2020.India has been extremely active in the country, extending a line of credit of $ 1 billion and approving four projects worth $ 450 million besides encouraging the setting up of campuses by Indian Universities like Sharda, Amity and Sambhroom and medical centres like Medanta. Cadilla is investing $50 million in a pharma plant.Presidents of Turkmenistan, the country with the most reclusive foreign policy, have visited India thrice. India established an IT centre in 2011 and an industrial training centre in 2002. Ashgabat has been pressing New Delhi to put plans for a gas pipeline, traversing Afghanistan and Pakistan, into operation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-to-host-indias-first-ever-summit-with-central-asia-later-today-364673

A high BMI can indicate high body fatness," stated the website of US' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Three days after Air India's sale was announced on October 8 last year, a Letter of Intent (LoI) was issued to the Tata Group confirming the government's willingness to sell its 100 percent stake in the airline. On October 25, the Centre signed the share purchase agreement (SPA) for this deal.Officials said all the formalities for handover are close to completion.As a part of the deal, the Tata group will also be handed over Air India Express and a 50 percent stake in ground handling arm Air India SATS.Tatas had on October 8 beat the Rs 15,100-crore offer by a consortium led by SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh and the reserve price of Rs 12,906 crore set by the government for the sale of its 100 percent stake in the loss-making carrier.While this will be the Centre's first privatisation since 2003-04, Air India will be the third airline brand in the Tatas' stable as it holds a majority interest in AirAsia India and Vistara, a joint venture with Singapore Airlines Ltd.                                      #AirIndia                                     #TataGroup||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tatas-take-first-step-in-air-india-to-introduce-enhanced-meal-service-in-4-flights-on-thursday-364666
27-01-2022||Islamabad||Pak Hindu lawmaker urges India to issue visas to delegation of pilgrims||A prominent Hindu lawmaker from Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's ruling party on Wednesday urged India to issue visas to a delegation of pilgrims to visit the country as part of his faith tourism initiative between the two neighbouring countries.Patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Hindu Council and Member of National Assembly Dr. Ramesh Kumar Vankwani said on Monday that he would lead a delegation of Pakistani pilgrims to India on January 29 on a special chartered flight of the Pakistan Airlines International (PIA).In a video message shared with PTI, he said that a group of 170 pilgrims who were ready to go to India by a special flight of the PIA were waiting for New Delhi's approval."I hope that approval will come from India by tomorrow. I have written a letter today to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. I have urged (India) to issue tomorrow, in one day, pilgrimage visas to 170 people or they should be given visas on arrival,” he said.In New Delhi, there was no official word on the proposal from the Indian side.Vankwani said that the schedule of travel on January 29 should not be disturbed as all arrangements have been made, including chartered PIA planes. “So there should not be any change in the plan,” he urged.He also said the pilgrims would visit Ajmer Sharif, Jaipur, Agra, New Delhi and Haridwar and then fly back on February 1 by using the PIA flight. He said that a delegation of 170 devotees from India would travel to Pakistan on February 20, followed by another delegation from India on March 1.Vankwani claimed that the religious tourism initiative had already begun on January 1 when a delegation came to Pakistan from India.He said that the faith tourism initiative has the potential to deepen bilateral relations and in days to come, it will expand from religious tourism to trade and travel and finally work as a big bridge to improve ties between the two countries.His video message came a day after diplomatic sources in Islamabad told PTI that the Indian government has not formally consented to Vankwani's proposal."It is purely a private initiative by Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, but he needs consent of the Indian government, which has not been granted as yet,” according to the sources here, amidst a chill in bilateral ties between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue and cross-border terrorism.To a question about the approval of Pakistani authorities to the idea of Vankwani for launching religious tourism with India, the sources just said that "Foreign Office is on board" about the proposal.Vankwani said that he would lead the group of Pakistani devotees to India as part of “faith tourism” between the two countries."“We have started faith tourism. Every month a flight will go from here (Pakistan) to there (India) and vice versa,” he said in a voice message shared with PTI.Devotees from India would come to Pakistan by Air India flight and travellers from Pakistan to India would fly by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), he said.                                      #Pakistan                                     #Pilgrims||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/pak-hindu-lawmaker-urges-india-to-issue-visas-to-delegation-of-pilgrims-364665

Several trains on the route were diverted,” the official said.The banned outfit had called for a 24-hour bandh in Jharkhand to protest against the arrest of its top leader Prashant Bose alias Kishan Da, who was carrying a bounty of Rs 1 crore on his head, by Jharkhand Police.Bose was the mastermind behind more than 100 incidents of attack and arson in Jharkhand, Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.Giridih Superintendent of Police Amit Renu reached the spot after the blast, and an investigation had been initiated, an officer said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maoists-trigger-blast-on-railway-track-in-jharkhand-train-services-disrupted-364664

27-01-2022||Washington||Joined by former VP Ansari, US lawmakers express concern over human rights situation in India||Joined by former vice-president Hamid Ansari, four US lawmakers, including a senator, expressed concerns on Wednesday over the current human rights situation in India.The Indian government and the ruling BJP deny these allegations."As the Indian government continues to target the practices of minority faiths, it creates an atmosphere where discrimination and violence can take root. In recent years, we have seen an uptick in online hate speeches and acts of hate, including vandalised mosques, torched churches, and communal violence," Senator Ed Markey said.Democratic Senator Markey, who has a history of taking anti-India stands, including opposing the India-US civil nuclear deal during the Manmohan Singh government, was speaking at a panel discussion organised by the Indian-American Muslim Council. Participating in the virtual panel discussion from India, former vice president Ansari expressed his concern over the rising trend of Hindu nationalism."In recent years, we have experienced the emergence of trends and practices that dispute the well-established principle of civic nationalism and interpose a new and imaginary practice of cultural nationalism....It wants to distinguish citizens on the basis of their faith, give vent to intolerance, insinuate otherness, and promote disquiet and insecurity," he alleged.The three other Congressmen who spoke during the panel discussion - Jim McGovern, Andy Levin and Jamie Raskin - have traditionally taken anti-India stands irrespective of the governments in power in New Delhi."There have been a lot of problems with the issue of religious authoritarianism and discrimination taking place in India," Raskin said. "So we want to make sure that India stays on the path of respecting religious liberty, freedom, pluralism, toleration and dissent for everybody," he added."Regrettably, today, the world's largest democracy is seeing backsliding, human rights under attack and religious nationalism. Since 2014, India has fallen from 27 to 53 on the Democracy Index. And Freedom House has downgraded India from free to partly free," Levin said.McGovern, co-chair of the powerful Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission of the US House of Representatives, listed several warning signs that showed India's "alarming backsliding" on human rights, according to a media release issued by the Indian American Muslim Council.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/joined-by-former-vp-ansari-us-lawmakers-express-concern-over-human-rights-situation-in-india-364659

27-01-2022||New Delhi||'Mischievous propaganda', says Ghulam Nabi Azad after speculation about political plans post Padma honour||A day after he was awarded the Padma Bhushan, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and Congress veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad on Wednesday sought to scotch speculation about his future political plans.Reports had claimed that he had changed his Twitter profile, but Azad, who has been critical of his party leadership and is the lone Congress leader to be awarded this year under the Modi dispensation, denied it.“Some mischievous propaganda being circulated by some people to create confusion. Nothing has been removed or added to my Twitter profile. The profile is as it was earlier,” Azad said on Twitter.Azad’s Twitter profile has nothing written on it and there is no reference to the Congress party.In the age of social media, the Twitter profiles of leaders are keenly watched as many tend to change them before formally switching parties.Azad, the former Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, is a prominent member of the G23 dissident leaders who have been demanding an organisational overhaul in the Congress and has faced backlash from a section of the party.After the announcement of the Padma awards on Tuesday evening, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, while commenting on CPI (M) leader Buddhadeb Bhattacharya’s refusal to accept the award, said, “He wants to be Azad not Ghulam”.However, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal, who is also in the G23, said on Wednesday that it was ironic that the Congress does not need Azad’s services when the nation recognises his contributions to public life.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had showered praise on Azad during his farewell speech for the Congress leader in the Upper House and the latter had returned the sentiment.Azad has recently travelled extensively in villages of Jammu and Kashmir and has received an encouraging response. He is again planning to visit Jammu and Kashmir in the coming days, sources said.                                      #Congress                                     #Padmaaward||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mischievous-propaganda-says-ghulam-nabi-azad-after-speculation-about-political-plans-post-padma-honour-364631
27-01-2022||Kasaragod (Kerala)||Kerala Minister unfurls national flag upside down; BJP seeks his resignation||A Kerala minister hoisted the national flag upside down in this district, during the Republic Day celebrations on Wednesday, triggering a political controversy as the opposition BJP demanded his resignation for showing disrespect to the tricolour.The incident occurred when minister Ahamed Devarkovil, who holds the Port and Archaeology portfolios in the Left government, unfurled the flag at the Municipal Stadium here this morning.Later, the minister told reporters that there was no lapse from his side and he just hoisted the flag when the officials concerned handed him the rope.He also said the district police chief and the Additional District Magistrate were asked to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into the incident and assured stringent measures would be taken against those responsible the lapse.A nominee of the Indian National League (INL), an ally of the CPM-led LDF, Devarkovil was the chief guest of the Republic Day celebrations at the district headquarters.“It was the officials who should have conducted a trial-run before the minister comes for flag hoisting. As far as ministers are concerned, we can only go on the scheduled time as per the protocol and unfurl the flag. There will be sure action against those responsible for the incident. Investigation is going on,” he said.Interestingly, no one, including the minister, peoples’ representatives, police officials and other dignitaries present on the occasion, noticed the gaffe.After the flag hoisting, the minister saluted it and proceeded with his speech, amidst which some media personnel who had gathered there to cover the event pointed out the error. Then the minister came back, lowered the flag and hoisted it again correctly.Meanwhile, BJP state chief K Surendran sought the immediate resignation of Devarkovil and registration of a police case against him and the officials concerned who showed disrespect to the national flag.“It is a matter of serious concern that the minister also saluted the tricolour after it was hoisted upside down. It is ridiculous that despite such a grave mistake, neither the minister nor the officials realised the error,” he said in a statement.He also wanted the state DGP to order a probe into the incident.Senior Congress leader and Member of Parliament, Rajmohan Unnithan, who was present during the occasion, termed the incident as “unfortunate” and wanted the government to take action.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-minister-unfurls-national-flag-upside-down-bjp-seeks-his-resignation-364630

The mechanised columns of the Army showed one PT-76 tank, one Centurion tank, two MBT Arjun MK-I tanks, one OT-62 TOPAZ armoured personnel carrier, one BMP-I infantry fighting vehicle and two BMP-II infantry fighting vehicles.The ceremony began with Prime Minister Narendra Modi leading the nation in paying homage to the martyrs by laying a wreath at the National War Memorial, a monument to the soldiers who have made supreme sacrifice for the country.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and the three service chiefs were present at the solemn ceremony.The prime minister ditched his traditional turban look on Republic Day this year and wore a traditional cap from Uttarakhand with an image of the brahmakamal, the state flower, and also sported a stole from Manipur.Official sources said Modi uses the brahmakamal whenever he offers prayers at the Kedarnath shrine in Uttarakhand.Turbans have previously been a highlight of the prime minister's sartorial choices at Independence Day and Republic Day events.There was no chief guest at the parade this year. However, Swachhagrah, frontline workers, auto-rickshaw drivers, construction workers and labourers who prepared the majestic tableaus were among special guests invited this year to the Republic Day parade.The parade started at 10.30 am this year, half-an-hour later than usual for better visibility.Commanded by Lt Gen Vijay Kumar Mishra, with Maj Gen Alok Kacker as the second-in-command, the parade began with President Ram Nath Kovind taking the salute. The national flag was unfurled followed by the national anthem, synchronised with a 21-gun salute.Horse-mounted soldiers of the Indian Army's 61 Cavalry Regiment, the only active horsed cavalry unit in the world currently, was the first marching contingent at the parade. This regiment's contingent was led by Major Mrityunjay Singh Chouhan.The parade saw the launch of 'Shaheedon Ko Shat Shat Naman' programme by the National Cadet Corps and a display of 10 scrolls each of 75 metres prepared during the 'Kala Kumbh' event besides installation of 10 large LED screens for a better viewing experience of spectators.The contingents of security forces were followed by tableaux from states that showcased India's cultural diversity, with themes ranging from the freedom struggle to biodiversity. Several government ministries and departments also took out tableaux, highlighting flagship initiatives such as the Jal Jeevan Mission. The Central Public Works Development tableau paid tribute to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on his 125th birth anniversary.The Lok Adalat tableau made its debut on Rajpath this year. The theme of the float by National Legal Services Authority was ‘Ek Mutthi Aasman (Inclusive Legal System): Lok Adalat’. The front part of the tableau showcased 'Nyay Sabke Liye', a hand gesture of fearlessness, guarantee and protection.Martyrs and independence movement was the theme of poll-bound Punjab's tableau while the Department of Post's tableau displayed the robust outreach and the modern face of India Post as well as all-women post offices to showcase the steps taken towards gender equality.Dancers from the Kunbi community, the original inhabitants of Goa, and glimpses from the liberation struggle were the highlight of the tableau of the coastal state while Karnataka's skillfully made pots, carefully sculpted sandalwood miniatures and rich tradition of handicraft were on display in the state's tableau.Known otherwise to witness huge bustling crowds across many age groups, the annual ceremonial event at Rajpath was scaled down this time in view of the coronavirus pandemic, with spectators' size drastically cut to 5,000 from the 25,000 last year.In the pre-pandemic times, over one lakh spectators used to witness the parade.From members of contingents to spectators, everyone wore masks. The audience maintained the mandated distance while sitting, and standing spectators were not allowed.Only double vaccinated adults and children above the age of 15 who have taken at least one dose of a Covid vaccine were allowed to enter the venue. Children below 15 were not permitted to attend. There was tight security with personnel maintaining strict vigil. Chairs were placed at a distance to ensure social distancing. Participants also received a white cap with ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ printed on it.Delhi was brought under a heavy security cover as the city police had intensified patrolling and sealed the borders of the national capital in coordination with its counterparts from the neighbouring states to thwart any untoward incident amid a terror alert by intelligence agencies.Over 27,000 police personnel were deployed on Republic Day security duties in Delhi and anti-terror measures intensified.                                     #Republicday                                     #RepublicDay2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/magnificent-flypast-at-73rd-republic-day-parade-celebrations-scaled-down-due-to-covid-scare-364622

The prices include Rs 150 service charge. Both the vaccines are only authorised for emergency use in the country.An Subject Expert Committee on COVID-19 of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation on January 19 recommended granting regular market approval to Covid vaccines Covishield and Covaxin for use in the adult population subject to certain conditions.“The NPPA has been asked to work towards capping the price of the vaccines. The price is likely to be capped at Rs 275 per dose along with an additional service charge of Rs 150,” an official source said.Prakash Kumar Singh, the director (government and regulatory affairs) at Serum Institue of India, had submitted an application to the Drugs Controller General of India on October 25 seeking regular market approval for its Covishiled vaccine.A couple of weeks ago, V Krishna Mohan, the whole-time director at Bharat Biotech, submitted complete information on the chemistry, manufacturing and controls, along with the pre-clinical and clinical data while seeking regular market authorisation for Covaxin.Covaxin and Covishield were granted Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) on January 3 last year. —                                     #cap                                     #corona                                     #coronavirus                                     #Covaxin                                     #Covishield                                     #price                                     #vaccine||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/each-dose-of-covishield-covaxin-likely-to-be-capped-at-rs-275-after-getting-regular-market-approval-364621

This is a country which has been globally recognised as a sponsor of terrorism and holds the ignoble record of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the UN Security Council,” Counsellor in India's Permanent Mission to the UN R Madhu Sudan said.“So much so that most terrorist attacks around the world today have their origin, in some form or the other, in Pakistan,” he said. His statement came days after  a siege at a synagogue in Texas, US, that ended with the killing of British hostage taker of Pakistani heritage, Malik Faisal Akram.Madhu Sudan said he is constrained to take the UNSC floor again, after India's envoy TS Tirumurti had delivered the national statement at the debate, only because the Representative of Pakistan “chose to sully this august Council through his Pavlovian and frivolous remarks against my country. While his statement deserves our collective contempt, it is important for me to set the record straight.”He said even as the Council is discussing protection of civilians at the meeting, the biggest threat to civilians comes from terrorists."As we mentioned earlier, the perpetrators of the heinous terror attack in Mumbai in 2008 continue to enjoy patronage of the state which he represents,” Madhu Sudan said, referring to the Pakistani envoy.Hafiz Saeed-led Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) is the front organisation for the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) which is responsible for carrying out the Mumbai terror attacks. Saeed has been serving jail sentence at the Kot Lakhpat Jail, Lahore, in Pakistan for his conviction in terror financing cases.In his remarks earlier in the debate, Tirumurti said any debate on protection of civilians in urban areas would be incomplete without taking into account the carnage wrought by terrorist forces, especially those backed by state actors.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-slams-pakistan-at-un-says-perpetrators-of-26-11-mumbai-attacks-continue-to-enjoy-its-patronage-364609

Congratulations bhaijan.""Ironic that the Congress doesn't need his services when the nation recognises his contributions to public life," he said.Another G-23 leader Shashi Tharoor also congratulated Azad."Warm congratulations to Shri @ghulamnazad on his Padma Bhushan. It is good to be recognised for one's public service even by a government of the other side," Tharoor tweeted.However, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had on Tuesday taken a veiled dig at Azad who was conferred the award."Right thing to do. He wants to be Azad not Ghulam," Ramesh said on Twitter after former West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya declined the Padma award.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ironic-congress-doesnt-need-his-services-when-nation-recognises-them-kapil-sibal-on-padma-award-to-azad-364598
