26-01-2022||New Delhi||SC raps Patna HC for granting bail to murder accused in ‘mechanical, most perfunctory manner’||The Supreme Court has rapped the Patna High Court for granting bail without assigning any reason and set it aside directing the murder accused to surrender back to jail forthwith, saying the order was passed “mechanically and in a most perfunctory manner”.A bench comprising justices M R Shah and Sanjiv Khanna, in the verdict passed on Monday, referred to the bail order of the high court and took note of the fact that it neither contained reasons nor considered the vehement submissions with regard to criminal antecedent of the accused.“From the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court, it can be seen that no reasons whatsoever have been assigned by the High Court while releasing the respondent No.2 on bail. ...Neither the High Court has considered the gravity, nature and seriousness of the offences alleged against the accused,” the judgment said.“It appears that the High Court has passed the order mechanically and in a most perfunctory manner, Justice Shah, writing the judgment, said, adding even otherwise the High Court has erred in not considering the material relevant to the determination of whether the accused was to be enlarged on bail.“The High Court has not at all adverted to the relevant considerations for grant of bail. In the case of ..., it is observed and held by this Court that while granting bail, the relevant considerations are, (i) nature of seriousness of the offence; (ii) character of the evidence and circumstances which are peculiar to the accused; and (iii) likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice; (iv) the impact that his release may make on the prosecution witnesses, its impact on the society; and (v) likelihood of his tampering,” it said.Referring to the legal principles laid down in past judgements, it said that the bail order did not consider the fact that the accused is a “history sheeter and is having a criminal antecedent and is involved in the double murder of having killed the father and brother of the informant and the trial of these cases is at the crucial stage of recording evidence”.It said the high court also did take note of the allegations that the man was accused of pressuring the informant and the witnesses.“The bail is absolutely unsustainable and the same cannot stand. The High Court has not at all considered the gravity, nature and seriousness of the offences alleged,” it held.Usually, the grant of bail by a court below is not reversed by higher courts.The verdict came on the plea of Sunil Kumar seeking cancellation of bail granted to Ramawatar Bhagat accused of killing his elder brother Shardanand Bhagat in 2020 in Vaishali district in Bihar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-raps-patna-hc-for-granting-bail-to-murder-accused-in-mechanical-most-perfunctory-manner-364652
26-01-2022||Lucknow||Opinion Polls are ‘Opium Polls’ : Akhilesh Yadav||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday warned people against opinion polls ahead of Uttar Pradesh assembly calling them “opium polls”.“Opinion Polls in reality are Opium polls. We need to be careful of them,” Yadav said in his address at the party office here on the occasion of Republic Day.“BJP leaders want to take the election in a different direction with their statements. All kinds of misconceptions are being spread on WhatsApp,” he said.The SP had earlier written to the Election Commission demanding ban on opinion polls on news channels, terming them a violation of election code of conduct.Yadav said people with “negative mindset” and those “dividing the society” want to take the country backwards.“The country got its freedom through a long struggle and sacrifice of thousands of youths. A pledge must be taken to save this freedom, democracy, and the Constitution,” he said.Yadav alleged that the BJP government “insulted” the farmers during the farm bill strife and exhorted people to come together against it.“Farmers’ sons are protecting the border. But farmers are being harassed in the country and subjected to use of force. What was done to crush the farmers’ protest we all know. Everyone must consider this assembly election as their own. It will be decisive.”Yadav also claimed that people’s problems will go away after March 10 when SP will have come to the power.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opinion-polls-are-opium-polls-akhilesh-yadav-364650

26-01-2022||New Delhi||Violence by rail job aspirants: Exams suspended, grievance panel set up, minister appeals for calm||The Railways suspended its NTPC and Level 1 exams on Wednesday after the candidates went on a rampage in some states alleging irregularities in the process whilst minister Ashwini Vaishnaw urged them not to destroy public property and assured redressal of their grievances.The suspension of exams and the statement by the minister are being seen in certain quarters as a step down from the earlier decision to bar applicants found indulging in vandalism given that elections are due in five states, including the politically crucial Uttar Pradesh.“I am telling the aspirants that this is their own property. Why are they destroying something that is their own? However, authorities will follow due process if public property is damaged,” Vaishnaw said at a press conference.The Railway Ministry formed a high-level committee, headed by Deepak Peter Gabriel, the principal executive director of industrial relations in the ministry, to examine the aspirants’ grievances.Sources say it was the protests by the job aspirants in Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh for two days and the fear that the agitation may fan out in other parts of the country through the aggressive social media campaigns being run by the candidates forced the Railways’ hand.Bihar, home to a majority of the job aspirants, saw violent protests for the third day in a row. A crowd stormed the Gaya Junction and set on fire the Bhabhua-Patna InterCity Express. But nobody was injured.East Central Railway CPRO Rajesh Kumar told PTI-Bhasha, “The rakes were empty and parked inside the yard when miscreants set a coach on fire. It has not resulted in disruption of rail traffic.”In Sitamarhi, police fired in the air to disperse the demonstrators at the railway station. Protests were also reported from Patna, Nawada, Muzaffarpur, Buxar and Bhojpur districts.In Uttar Pradesh, police arrested two persons and lodged a case against around 1,000 unidentified people for allegedly rioting and blocking the train tracks. Six police personnel were suspended with immediate effect for using unnecessary force on Tuesday.A police official said it appears the accused had taken “money from some political parties” to cause unrest. Police were also probing the incident from this angle.A video of the incident surfaced on social media, following which Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra condemned the use of force against the protesting job aspirants.She added the government should put a stop to the action of entering the hostels of students for carrying out searches and damaging property.Rahul Gandhi said students were the hope of their families and the country and asserted that if independence can be taken through non-violent opposition then why not rights.In an attempt to placate the candidates, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said his ministry is in touch with chief ministers and the issue is being handled “sensitively”.“I urge the candidates to put forth their grievances formally. Our intention is to resolve this issue quickly. A committee has been formed and it will examine representations by the candidates,” he said.Vaishnaw urged the aspirants not to take the law into their hands and promised to “seriously address their grievances and concerns”. He said all Railway Recruitment Board chairpersons have been asked to listen to the concerns of candidates and send them to the panel.“An email address has been set up for this purpose. The panel will go to different parts of the country and listen to the grievances,” he said.The candidates are opposing the Railways’ decision to hold the exam in two stages, claiming the second stage for final selection tantamount to “cheating” those who appeared and cleared the first stage of the Railways’ Non-Technical Popular Categories (NTPC) for computer-based test released on January 15.Around 1.25 crore candidates had applied for the exams that had advertised over 35,000 posts from levels 2 to 6.It is being alleged that the exam is designed to favour those with a higher qualification, even for jobs that require lesser qualification.However, Vaishnaw said, “The employment notification has legal sanctity. For those with grievances, we have to find a solution and deal with sensitivity. We cannot legally bar graduates from applying to posts which require 10+2 qualification.” Of the total vacancies, 24,281 are open to graduates and 11,000 for under-graduates. These posts, segregated in groups based on 7th CPC pay-scale levels from two to six, include that of train assistants, guards, junior clerks, timekeepers and station masters.For a Level 2 job, the starting pay is about Rs 19,000 and one requires to be a Class 12 pass, while for a level six post like station master, with a starting pay of about Rs 35,000, graduation is a must.Railways said shortlisting of candidates has been done separately for each level based on options exercised and educational qualification.“For second stage computer-based test of each level, candidates have been called 20 times the community-wise vacancies notified against each RRB,” the minister said.Based on merit obtained in the second stage CBT, candidates will be shortlisted for the third stage in which eight times the number of vacancies will be called. The final result will contain a unique list of 35,281 notified vacancies and no one will be appointed against more than one post.The CBT 2 exam, for which 7 lakh candidates have been shortlisted, was scheduled for February 14 and 18. The tests now stand suspended.

26-01-2022||Vibha Sharma||Gandhi family loyalist RPN Singh joins BJP||New Delhi, January 25Senior Congress leader RPN Singh, the party’s star campaigner for Uttar Pradesh, today joined the rival BJP ahead of the elections to the key state, becoming yet another name in the long list of leaders to have crossed over to the saffron party in the recent past.Congress No longer the same partyIt’s (Cong) no longer the party where I began… Not the same ideology. For years, people had been telling me to join the BJP. Here I am today. Better late than never. RPN SinghThe Gandhi family loyalist who was a minister in the UPA government joined the BJP in the presence of its top leadership, including Union Ministers Jyotiraditya Scindia, Anurag Thakur and Dharmendra Pradhan and UP Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya.Singh praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP president JP Nadda and all the development works by BJP’s “double-engine government” in UP, in particular his region Purvanchal. “What people there dreamt of has been realised,” he said, also praising the law and order in the state.Targeting the Congress, he recalled his association with “the party he was in for 32 years” where he “worked with dedication and honesty”. “It’s no longer the party where I began… Not the same ideology. For years, people had been telling me to join the BJP. Here I am today, better late than never,” Singh said. Pradhan, BJP’s UP in-charge, said he had been personally pursuing Singh to join the BJP.Sources said Singh was upset with the Congress over various issues and had been in touch with the BJP leadership for the past few days. Speculations are rife that the OBC leader may be fielded from Padrauna against Swami Prasad Maurya, who recently switched from the BJP to the Samajwadi Party. Singh had represented Padrauna in the Assembly for three terms and also defeated Maurya from Kushinagar in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls.Singh’s joining the BJP is a major setback for the Congress, particularly Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who was looking to revive the party in UP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gandhi-family-loyalist-rpn-singh-joins-bjp-364458
26-01-2022||---||Our battle not for cowards: Cong on RPN Singh's exit||New Delhi, January 25Soon after RPN Singh joined the BJP, the Congress said the ideological battle it was fighting was “not meant for cowards”. Party spokesperson Supriya Shrinate made it a point to downplay his exit, saying she still did not know which party Singh was joining. Later, quoting AICC general secretary UP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Shrinate said the Congress’ fight was against government’s resources and agencies and only the brave could sustain it.Party’s revival a challengeRPN Singh, 57, AICC in-charge for Jharkhand, CWC member and UP Congress star campaigner (declared on Monday), follows in the footsteps of Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jitin Prasada, Sushmita Dev, Priyanka Chaturvedi and Lalitesh Tripathi, who quit the Congress for other parties. His exit ahead of the UP polls reinforces the perception that Congress’ revival in the state was a mighty challenge.“It is a battle of ideology and truth. To fight a battle as strongly pitched as this one, you have to fight with courage. You have to fight with a lot of dedication. I don’t think this battle is meant for cowards. Priyanka has already said that leaders need to be on their toes, full of courage. You cannot be a coward and fight this battle,” Shrinate said.A member of the UPA council of ministers along with Scindia and Prasada, RPN is the scion of Sainthwar royal family of eastern UP’s Kushi Nagar. His father Chandra Pratap Narain was an MLA, two-time MP and a minister in late PM Indira Gandhi’s cabinet. Although the Congress dismissed his exit, RPN, a prominent OBC leader, could sway the election in Kushi Nagar adjoining Yogi’s LS seat Gorakhpur.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/our-battle-not-for-cowards-cong-on-rpns-exit-364459

It said political parties should also be made parties to the PIL.“We want to know how to control this. It’s a serious issue no doubt. The freebie budget is going beyond the regular budget and sometimes… Even though it’s not a corrupt practice, but it creates an uneven playing field,” the CJI said.Holding that freebies promised in poll manifestos vitiated the electoral process, the top court had on July 5, 2013, asked the EC to frame guidelines to check it in consultation with political parties.On Tuesday, the CJI lamented that the EC has held only one meeting with political parties on the issue after the top court’s order.“The EC framed guidelines without any teeth. Every party is doing it. Who will pay the money? Look at Punjab,” senior counsel Vikas Singh submitted on behalf of the petitioner, a Delhi BJP leader.“Why are you naming one particular state?” CJI Ramana said. Such promises by the political parties violated Articles 14, 162, 266(3) and 282 of the Constitution and amounted to bribery and undue influence under Section 171B and Section 171C of the IPC, he said.“The injury to the citizens is extremely large because Punjab needs Rs 12,000 crore per month to fulfil the political promises if AAP comes to power, Rs 25,000 crore per month if SAD comes to power and Rs 30,000 crore (per month) if Congress comes to power, though GST collection is Rs 1,400 crore only,” Upadhyay submitted.“In fact, after debt repayment, the Punjab Government is not able to pay even salaries and pensions. Then, how will it provide freebies? The bitter truth is that Punjab’s debt is increasing every subsequent year. The state’s outstanding debt has increased to Rs 77,000 crore, with Rs 30,000 crore accumulating in the present financial year itself,” the PIL pointed out.In UP, Congress promised a smartphone to every girl studying in Class XII, a scooty to every girl pursuing graduation, free public transport for women, eight free gas cylinders per year to every housewife, free medical treatment up to Rs 10 lakh per family to voters, the petitioner submitted.“Political parties are prioritising their self-interest over national interest and the public fund, which should have been properly utilised to secure fundamental rights of citizens, is being used to lure voters,” Upadhyay said.                                     #ElectionCommission                                     #SupremeCourt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/serious-issue-sc-seeks-ec-response-on-poll-sops-364427
26-01-2022||---||PM Modi for 'one nation, one poll', says turnout must increase||New Delhi, January 25Ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today expressed concern over low voting percentage, especially in urban areas that are considered educated and prosperous. This needs to change in a vibrant democracy like India, he said, interacting with BJP workers from across the country.Should have 75% voting in next LS poll: NaiduNew Delhi: Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday called for increasing the voter turnout to at least 75 per cent in the next Lok Sabha elections. In his message at an event to mark the 12th National Voters' Day, Naidu said as a nation, “we must think and arrive at a consensus to have simultaneous elections to all three tiers of our democracy and move towards better governance”. Naidu was the chief guest at the event but could attend the function as he is in home isolation in Hyderabad after testing positive for Covid. TNSDevelopment suffersContinuous elections result in politics being seen in everything, and development suffers. Narendra Modi, PMPM Modi also raised the issues of “one nation, one election” and “one nation, one voters’ list” in the address on a day coinciding with National Voters’ Day.The PM said the voting percentage rose from 45 per cent in the first Lok Sabha polls in 1951-52 to 67 per cent in 2019. “While the rise in the participation of women voters is a good sign, but everyone — from citizens to members of political parties — should also think over low polling,” he said.It is seen that urban areas, which are considered educated and prosperous, have low polling, the PM said, lamenting that though people discussed elections on social media, they did not actually go and vote. He urged BJP’s “panna pramukhs” to work towards ensuring 75 per cent polling in every election.                                     #NarendraModi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-for-one-nation-one-poll-says-turnout-must-increase-364438

If the petitioners have any other suggestion, they may file a representation before the authorities which may be considered on its own merits by the authorities,” the Bench said. Mehta also questioned the locus standi of the petitioner, a US-based NGO, saying, “I don’t know what’s the purpose of this PIL. Something is amiss,” he said.The FCRA requires NGOs to get a licence from the MHA authorising them to receive foreign funds. On behalf of the petitioner, senior Advocate Sanjay Hegde urged the Bench to extend the FCRA licences of NGOs if they applied for extension in the next two weeks. However, the Bench said the petitioner might submit a representation to the authorities which may consider it on merits.                                     #SupremeCourt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/foreign-funding-no-sc-relief-for-6k-ngos-364439

Azad was J&K CM at the time.Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, former Bengal CM, who led the CPM government in the state from 2000 to 2011 was another surprise mention among 17 Padma Bhushan awardees that also included the India-born heads of Microsoft and Google – Satya Nadella and Sunder Pichai.                                     #PadmaAwards||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nda-continues-to-fete-opposition-ghulam-nabi-azad-buddhadeb-among-padma-bhushan-awardees-364405

26-01-2022||New Delhi||A new India is emerging—strong and sensitive: President Kovind||President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday hailed the transformation of a Haryana village by its natives saying a new India, which was strong and sensitive, was emerging.Urging all successful people to work for the development of their birthplaces, the president said rights and duties were two sides of the same coin and doing one’s duty well was the foremost contribution to the nation.In his address to the nation on the eve of the 73rdRepublic Day, the president made a special mention of citizens of Bhiwani’s Sui village collaborating to transform the area under ‘Swa-Prerit Adarsh Gram Yojana’, thereby demonstrating sensitivity.“This example strengthens my belief that a new India is emerging – a strong India and a sensitive India;Sashakt Bharat, Samvedan-sheel Bharat. I am sure that taking inspiration from this example, other resourceful people will also contribute for the development of their villages and cities,” said the president crediting his own native village Paraunkh in UP for his ascent to the Rashtrapati Bhavan.The president urged successful people to remember their roots and “serve their place of birth and the country in whatever way they can”.Noting that the observance of fundamental duties mentioned in the Constitution creates proper environment for the enjoyment of fundamental rights, President Kovind said by fulfilling the fundamental duty of rendering national service when called upon to do so, Indians had transformed the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and Covid vaccination drive into mass movements.The president however cautioned against lowering the guard saying Covid pandemic was still widespread.“Inthe fight against Covid, it has become a sacred national duty to follow the precautions suggested by our experts. We have to discharge this duty till the crisis isbehind us,” the president said referring to green shoots in the economy.He said the economy was on the move and was projected to grow at an impressive rate in this fiscal after going through contraction last year.“This shows the success of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan launched in the previous year. The government has shown relentless focus on reforming every economic sector and providing a helping hand wherever necessary,” President Kovind noted, crediting impressive economic performance to improvements in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors.The president hailed young farmers with small holdings for adopting natural farming.Lauding self-reliance in defence, the president said due to military capabilities like the soon to be inducted indigenous state-of-the-art aircraft carrier IAC Vikrant, India was now counted among the world’s leading naval powers. He remembered late CDS Gen Bipin Rawat saying, “When a brave soldier dies on duty, the entire country feels sad.”The president also spoke of women breaking the glass ceiling in the armed forces noting that better gender balance will benefit the forces.“As the supreme commander of the armed forces, I am glad to note that it has been a water-shed year for women empowerment in the armed forces. Our daughters have broken a glass ceiling, and permanent commission has now been allowed for women officers in new areas,” the president said, adding that the talent pipeline for the forces will be strengthened with women coming through Sainik Schools and the National Defence Academy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-new-india-is-emerging%E2%80%94strong-and-sensitive-president-kovind-364388
