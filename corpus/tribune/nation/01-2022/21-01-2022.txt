21-01-2022||Mukesh RanjanNew Delhi||CISF asks aviation authorities to implement ‘one hand bag’ rule meticulously||Domestic flyers will no longer be allowed to carry more than one hand baggage in the aircraft. The move is aimed to ease out congestion and security concerns and reduce the burden at screening points at airports.The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) has asked the aviation authorities to implement the ‘One Hand Bag’ order meticulously.As per the Bureau of Aviation Security (BCAS) Circular, no passenger should be permitted to carry more than one handbag barring a few exceptions, including women’s purses and laptop bags.The CISF guards all key airports in India. Officials explained that passengers, carrying more than one handbag, were leading to increased clearance time as well as delays, congestion in security checkpoints and inconvenience to other travellers.“However, it has been seen that passengers on an average carry 02-03 Nos of hand bags to the screening point. This has led to increased clearance time as well as delays, congestion in pre-embarkation security check (PESC) point and inconvenience to passengers. It is therefore felt that enforcement of the aforesaid Circulars must be ensured by all stakeholders/airlines,” read the circular.The airport security force has directed all airlines to inform the passengers about the one hand bag rule by putting this information on boarding passes/tickets of travellers. “All airlines may be directed suitably to inform passengers and to display ‘one hand bag rule’ on their tickets/boarding passes very conspicuously,” it said.It has also instructed airport operators to place hoardings in order to inform the passengers about the one hand bag rule. “Airport operators may be instructed to place hoarding/banner/board/ standees displaying the contents of the ‘One hand bag Rule’ near the check-in counters, vantage locations before SHA (security hold areas) at the airports, so that passengers get sensitised and if required, have an option to switch their extra hand bags to registered baggage,” the circular said.It has also instructed airport operators to place hoardings in order to inform the passengers about the one hand bag rule.“Airport operators may be instructed to place hoarding/banner/board/ standees displaying the contents of the ‘One hand bag Rule’ near the check-in counters, vantage locations before SHA (security hold areas) at the airports, so that passengers get sensitised and if required, have an option to switch their extra hand bags to registered baggage,” the circular further said.                                     #aiport                                     #aviationrules                                     #flights                                     #handbaggage                                     #limit||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cisf-asks-aviation-authorities-to-implement-one-hand-bag-rule-meticulously-363268

21-01-2022||Bengaluru||Karnataka government lifts weekend curfew; night curfew to continue||In a respite to citizens and businesses, the Karnataka government on Friday decided to lift the weekend curfew that was in place aimed at controlling the spread of Covid-19 infections.However, the night curfew between 10 PM and 5 AM every day, and all other Covid curbs including 50 per cent capacity in restaurants and other places will continue.Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai today held a meeting with experts, and senior Ministers and officials of his government to assess the Covid-19 situation in the state and curbs that were put in place to control its spread.“The week-end curfew on Saturday and Sunday is being lifted. This decision has been taken based on the experts’ report and it is subject to conditions. Now the rate of hospitalization is about 5 per cent, in case it increases we will re-impose week-end curfew,” Revenue Minister R Ashoka said.Speaking to reporters after over a two-hour-long meeting, he appealed to people to follow Covid guidelines and precautionary measures.“There has been demand from people, various organisations and political leaders from across party lines to lift weekend curfew, but we have taken this decision based on experts’ reports. However, the night curfew between 10 PM to 5A M every day will continue, along with a 50 per cent occupancy rule among others,” he said.The Minister also said that the restrictions on protests, rallies, fairs and events will also continue.Justifying the decision on continuing the night curfew, Ashoka in response to a question said, “There is a need to restrict night activities like partying...Covid is still around.” With a surge in cases, the government had last week decided to extend the existing Covid curbs such as night curfew and the weekend curfew till the end of January.The government was under tremendous pressure from citizens, businesses, organisations and political leaders across party lines including the ruling BJP, to end the weekend curfew.Primary and Secondary Education Minister B C Nagesh, who was also part of the meeting, said as the positivity rate is high in Bengaluru, the government will decide on reopening schools and colleges in the city on January 29, while in other places they will continue to operate as they are doing now.Except Bengaluru the decision to close schools will be taken by Deputy Commissioners of the district in consultation with Assistant Commissioner, Tahsildar, Taluk Health Officer and Block Education Officer, by taking into account school as a unit and not en masse. In case of high positivity at any school, it will shut for about seven days, and three days in case of less positivity.“Luckily, as there is less positivity rate among children of 6-15 years, we will continue to operate schools as it is going on now (other than in Bengaluru). In four to five districts there were district specific restrictions, the Deputy Commissioners will review and take steps to reopen schools according to local situation,” he added.Noting that the Covid cases in the state are expected to increase further, in response to a question Ashoka said, “we have based our decision to withdraw week-end curfew on experts’ report, what they (experts) are saying is, though the number of cases are increasing, the rate of hospitalization is in and around 5 per cent, for us rate of hospitalization is the yardstick.” He said, the government has taken the decision, scientifically, considering the whole state as one unit, and taking into account measures taken in the neighbouring states.Ashoka noted that until January 20 there were a total of 2,93,231 active cases in the state, of which 2,86,000 are in home isolation. A total of 5,344 persons are in hospital, of which 340 are in ICU and 127 under ventilator support.While the overall positivity rate is 19.94 per cent, the positivity rate among children is about 8 per cent and among adults is 16.57 per cent, he said, adding that the CM has directed special attention towards hospitalized children.                                     #corona                                     #coronavirus                                     #Covid                                     #Kanataka                                     #nightcurfew                                     #weekendcurfew||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-government-lifts-weekend-curfew-night-curfew-to-continue-363259

I have resigned from the party and I will be contesting as an independent from Panaji,” Utpal Parrikar was quoted as saying.He also said that resignation was a formality and that the BJP will “always remain in his heart”.“It is a difficult choice for me but I am doing it for the people of Goa. No one should be worried about my political future, people of Goa will do it,” he said.Former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis on Thursday said that the BJP had offered him “two options” one of which he had turned down. Sources said that senior leaders are “trying to make him see the reason via family members”.Utpal, however, said he was fighting for values he believes.“Let people of Panaji decide. I cannot negotiate with my party,” he said.On whether he will seek the support of other political parties, Utpal said the only platform for him was the BJP.“If not BJP, then I will (contest as) an independent. I will not go for any other party,” Parrikar said.                                     #goa                                     #Goaassemblypolls                                     #Goaassemblypolls2022                                     #Goapolls                                     #ManoharParrikar                                     #UtpalParrikar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/goa-assembly-polls-manohar-parrikars-son-utpal-to-contest-from-panaji-as-an-independent-363257
21-01-2022||New Delhi||AG gives consent for contempt action against Yati Narsinghanand for comments on Constitution, SC||Attorney General KK Venugopal on Friday gave his consent to initiate contempt action against Juna Akhara Mahamandleshwar's Yati Narsinghanand for his alleged utterances against the Constitution and the Supreme Court.Dharma Sansad case: Haridwar courts reject bail pleas of Yati Narsinghanand, Jitendra Narayan TyagiIn an interview given to one Vishal Singh being circulated on Twitter, Narshinghanand had allegedly said, “We have no trust in the Supreme Court of India and the Constitution. The Constitution will consume the 100 crore Hindus of this country. Those who believe in this Constitution will be killed. Those who believe in this system, in these politicians, in the Supreme Court, and in the Army will all die the death of a dog”.In a letter addressed to activist Shachi Nelli—who had sought his consent to initiate contempt proceedings against Swami Narsinghanand—Venugopal said the statement in question was “a direct attempt to lower the authority of the Supreme Court in the minds of the general public. This would certainly amount to contempt of the Supreme Court of India”.Arrested by the Haridwar Police on January 15 in a hate speech case, the Juna Akhara Mahamandleshwar was denied bail by a Haridwar court on Thursday.Nelli had written to Venugopal that the comments were a vile and clear attempt at interfering in the course of justice by means of abusive rhetoric and baseless attacks on the integrity of the Constitution and courts and undermined the majesty and the authority of the Supreme Court.According to Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, the Attorney General’s is needed to initiate contempt proceedings against anybody before the Supreme Court.“The Supreme Court of India is the first interpreter and the guardian of the Constitution of India. It is appalling to see the lack of faith and sheer contempt being expressed towards the fundamental frameworks of this country. The intent to undermine the Court and its capacity to dispense justice is evident”, Nelli had written to Venugopal, seeking his consent for contempt action against Swami Narsinghanand.Nelli had also referred to another video clip in which he allegedly said, “When Jitendra Singh Tyagi who went by the name Wasim Rizvi and wrote his book, not a single policeman, not one of these “hijde’ policemen or politicians had the courage to arrest him”.“Any such attempt to harm the majesty of the institution and diminish the faith that citizens of India have in the court can result in complete chaos and anarchy. This is perhaps the most vicious attack on the Supreme Court in its history,” Nelli had written in his letter.                                     #Constitution                                     #SC                                     #viralvideo                                     #YatiNarsinghanand||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ag-gives-consent-for-contempt-action-against-yati-narsinghanand-for-comments-on-constitution-sc-363256

21-01-2022||Mumbai||Bulli Bai app case: Three accused denied bail; court says their acts defamed womanhood||A court in Mumbai denied bail to three students arrested in the Bulli Bai app case by stating that the trio had committed serious acts of “defaming womanhood” and, therefore, in the larger interest of society the personal liberty of the accused can be curtailed.The Bulli Bai app had made public the details of several Muslim women in a bid to malign them, allowing users to participate in their ‘auction’.Vishal Kumar Jha, Shweta Singh and Mayak Rawat were denied bail by Bandra Metropolitan Court Magistrate Komalsing Raj on January 20, but a detailed cop of the order was made available on Friday.While Singh and Rawat were arrested by the Mumbai police’s cyber cell from Uttarakhand on January 5, Jha was nabbed from Bengaluru on January 4.“No doubt accused persons are students of tender age and they have a fundamental right to life and liberty, but those rights are subject to reasonable restrictions. They were arrested for collection of evidence relating to non-bailable offence and, hence, their arrest is not in violation of any law,” the magistrate said in the order.“They were found to have committed serious acts defaming womanhood. The larger interest of society is at stake. Therefore, their personal liberty can be said to be curtailed following due process of law,” the magistrate said.The court also noted there was “some ill-intention” on part of the creator and followers of the app as well as persons propagating and disseminating information about women of a particular religion.Stating that, prima facie, the involvement in of the accused is noticed, the court said, “The disputed fact is only in respect of exact role played by them. It is contended on behalf of the applicants that they are just followers and disseminated the information containing its link. Even if it is presumed they are just followers/subscribers of the application, at this stage it cannot be said they are innocent.” The court further said records showed their “active involvement” in propagating and disseminating the information/data relating to the women.Meanwhile, accused Vishal Kumar Jha has moved sessions court for bail, and his plea is likely to be heard on Monday.In the bail application, moved through his lawyer Shivam Deshmukh, the accused claimed he had been “falsely implicated in this case”.“The accused hails from a respectable family having deep roots in the eyes of society and any such act as alleged by the present complainant is beyond imagination,” Jha’s plea said.                                     #arrested                                     #bail                                     #BulliBai                                     #court                                     #students||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bulli-bai-app-case-three-accused-denied-bail-court-says-their-acts-defamed-womanhood-363250

Two FIRs have been lodged in Haridwar against more than 10 people, including Narasinghanand and Tyagi, in connection with the highly provocative speeches against Muslims delivered at the event.A special investigation team is probing the case. —                                     #court                                     #bail                                     #DharmaSansad                                     #Haridwar                                     #jail                                     #JitendraNarayanTyagi                                     #YatiNarsinghanand||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dharma-sansad-case-haridwar-courts-reject-bail-pleas-of-yati-narsinghanand-jitendra-narayan-tyagi-363244
21-01-2022||Kolkata||TMC welcomes Centre's decision to erect Netaji's statue, says it aims at putting to rest tableau controversy||Trinamool Congress on Friday welcomed Centre’s decision to install a statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at India Gate in the national capital, but asserted nonetheless that it was aimed at countering criticism after the rejection of West Bengal’s tableau themed on the nationalist leader for the Republic Day parade snowballed into a major row.The real tribute would be have been paid had the Centre taken steps to unearth the mystery shrouding Netaji’s disappearance, TMC said.“As the rejection of West Bengal’s tableau on Netaji has created a major controversy, the Centre is trying to divert attention. The decision to install the statue of Netaji is only aimed in that direction. But we welcome the decision. At the same time, we feel that the real tribute would have been paid had the government taken steps to unearth the mystery shrouding his disappearance,” TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh said.Echoing him, party MP Sougata Roy said after the rejection of the tableau on Netaji BJP’s claim of respecting icons of the nation stood exposed.“We welcome the decision. But we feel there is no harm in allowing Netaji’s tableau by the West Bengal government at the Republic Day parade. It was rejected due to narrow-minded politics. Now, as the BJP and its theatrics on the icons of our country has been exposed, it decided to install the statue,” Roy said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi Friday announced that a grand statue of the freedom fighter will be installed at India Gate as a symbol of  the country’s “indebtedness” to him . Till the granite statue is completed, a hologram statue would be put up at the same place,  Modi said.The prime minister said that he will himself unveil the hologram statue on January 23, the 125th birth anniversary of the nationalist leader. As the rejection of West Bengal’s tableau for the Republic Day parade snowballed into a major row, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh Tuesday wrote to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee informing her that the CPWD’s float for the occasion would pay homage to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, but her TMC was implacable saying the state’s “dignity has been hurt.”  In a letter to Modi on Sunday, Banerjee had expressed “shock” at the rejection of the state’s tableau which is themed on Bose and his Indian National Army. It also featured other Bengal icons like Rabindranath Tagore, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Swami Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo.Anita Bose-Pfaff, the only child of Bose, had said on Monday that the legendary freedom fighter’s legacy has often been “partly exploited” for political reasons.She minced no words while acknowledging the fanfare that marked the start of Bose’s 125th birth anniversary year celebrations in 2021 in Kolkata had something to do with the elections in West Bengal.“.....the opening of the anniversary year was celebrated in a bigger way, of all places in Kolkata, had something to do with election and election prospects in Bengal. The fact that nothing happened this year .... certainly the issue is not as important as last year,” she had told PTI in an interview.All India Forward Bloc, the party founded by Netaji, too welcomed the Centre’s decision but criticised the exclusion of West Bengal’s tableau highlighting Bose’s contributions.“We welcome the decision to install the statue of Netaji at India Gate. But we feel his legacy should not be seen through the prism of Centre-state politics. The Centre should have allowed West Bengal’s tableau,” Naren Chatterjee, the state secretary of the party, said.Bose had launched the AIFB in 1939.Leader of  Congress in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, said the BJP is trying to “hijack” the legacy of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.“The high-level committee that was formed to plan a year-long programme to commemorate the 125th birth anniversary of  the great leader  never discussed any such thing. As there has been a controversy, the BJP took this shortcut to counter the criticism,” he said.                                     #Netaji                                     #statue                                     #tableaurow                                     #TMC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-welcomes-centres-decision-to-erect-netajis-statue-says-it-aims-at-putting-to-rest-tableau-controversy-363242

21-01-2022||Patna||Bihar heading for midterm polls with NDA in turmoil, claims Chirag Paswan||Bihar is tipped for midterm polls as constituents of the ruling NDA are at each other's throat, former ally Chirag Paswan claimed here on Friday.Paswan claimed that the likelihood of early polls became evident when Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, "who does not venture out until faced with elections", recently planned a state-wide tour.He was replying to queries from journalists about recent squabbles between Kumar's JD(U) and the BJP, primarily over the manner in which liquor prohibition law is being implemented in the state."Since the day assembly polls results came out, I have been saying that this government is not going to last. The straw in the wind is now for all to see," said Paswan who heads a splinter group of Lok Janshakti Party.An ugly spat ensued after a JD(U) spokesman took potshots at state BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal over his offer of help to family members of those who died in a hooch tragedy in West Champaran district last year.Jaiswal is also engaged in a war of words with Upendra Kushwaha, the JD(U)'s parliamentary board chief, over the alleged denigration of Emperor Asoka by a Sahitya Akademi winning playwright, who is perceived to be close to the saffron party.Paswan further pointed towards notes of discord struck by Mukesh Sahni, a minister whose Vikassheel Insaan Party had joined NDA just ahead of the assembly polls in 2020.His party's MLA from Bochaha died recently and Sahni threatened to exit the alliance if the BJP or the JD(U) staked claim for the seat in by-election."All these things indicate man bhed (rift) as distinct from mat bhed (divergence of views). It is bad for any alliance," said Paswan.The former president of undivided LJP was also asked about the possibility of his return to the NDA, which some in the saffron party seem to be in favour of."My priority is to expand the footprints of my party. Future alliances will be thought about at the time of elections, not before that," said the Jamui MP, who is also being wooed by the RJD-led opposition. ---                                      #bihar                                     #ChiragPaswan                                     #midtermpolls                                     #NDA                                     #turmoil||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-heading-for-midterm-polls-with-nda-in-turmoil-claims-chirag-paswan-363236

Let it be listed in some other court next week,” said Justice Rao, who was sitting with Justice BR Gavai on the bench.The bench was to hear the plea of Tejpal whose application for conducting an in-camera hearing of the proceedings under Section 327 of the CrPC was rejected by the Goa bench of the Bombay High Court on November 24 last year.The acquittal of the former editor-in-chief of Tehelka magazine, who was accused of sexually assaulting his then-woman colleague in the lift of a five-star hotel in Goa in November 2013, by a sessions court in May 2021 was challenged in the Goa bench of the high court by the state government.Senior advocate Amit Desai, who had appeared for Tejpal, had referred to the Law Commission and various judgments of high courts supporting his application for an in-camera hearing.The high court, however, had rejected the submissions.                                      #TarunTejpal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-judge-recuses-from-hearing-tejpals-plea-in-sexual-assault-case-363204
21-01-2022||New Delhi||After joining BJP, Aparna Yadav takes 'blessings' of Mulayam Singh Yadav||After joining the BJP, Aparna Yadav has now visited her father-in-law and Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav to take his blessings.Sharing a photograph with her touching the feet of Mulayam Singh on the social media, she wrote: “After taking the membership of Bharatiya Janata Party, on coming to Lucknow, took blessings from pitaji/netaji”.The attempt is being viewed “more as a political event than a social or family courtesy call” by observers.      Aparna, the younger daughter-in-law of the SP founder, joined the BJP earlier this week—a development that was seen as a sign of a “rift” in the family at a time when party chief Akhilesh Yadav was working on building base by stitching alliances with several small caste-based parties and constructing Samajwadi narrative around social justice for backward classes and Dalits.Also, according to SP leaders, “Akhilesh was wary of closeness of her side of relatives to the BJP. In fact, they have done him a favour by taking relatives like Aparna and Pramod Gupta as he will not have to field them and counter allegations of ‘parivarvaad’ now, which he would have had to in case he had to give tickets to them”.Though it remains to be seen how many of his relatives actually feature in the final list of Samajwadi candidates.  Aparna is the wife of Mulayam Singh’s son Pratik from his second marriage. Gupta, an SP MLA from Auraiya’s Bidhuna constituency in 2012, is also related to Sadhna Gupta, Mulayam Singh’s second wife.Extending his good wishes to his sister-in-law, Akhilesh had said it is good that the ‘Samajwadi’ ideology is expanding and also that “‘Netaji’ (Mulayam Singh) tried very hard to convince her” to not join the BJP.It also remains to be seen whether the BJP will field Aparna from Lucknow Cantt, a constituency she appears to be interested in.

The BJP talked about doubling the income of farmers, it talked about increasing the cost of crops but farmers only suffered and died standing in queues for fertilisers. They collapsed under the burden of loans but Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not say a word," Singh said.He said that under the leadership of Arvind Kejriwal, AAP fought on behalf of farmers from the streets up to Parliament and, therefore, had a special guarantee for them."We have seen farmers suffer as prices went up and they had to wait for years for their dues. This will not be repeated when AAP is in power," Singh said.Earlier, as part of the Kejriwal guarantee, the party had announced financial aid of Rs 1,000 to all women above the age of 18, Rs 5,000 per month to unemployed youth, 300 units of power free and waiver of all pending power bills.

People who made unsavoury references against Mulayam Singh are being promoted,” said Gupta as the BJP continued its attempts to dent Yadav clan’s unity in the public eye.Laxmikant Bajpai, head of BJP’s UP committee that oversees new joining in the state, said today, “The fact is the SP is unable to keep its flock together.” Importantly, the BJP is conscious of history while poaching Mulayam Singh’s family members.Akhilesh likely to contest from KarhalSP chief Akhilesh Yadav is likely to contest the UP elections from the Karhal assembly segment in Mainpuri parliamentary constituency, party sources indicated on Thursday. Karhal has been an SP bastion since 1993, with a brief saffron spell between 2002 and 2007.Cong’s ‘ladki hoon’ poster girl joins BJPVice-President of UP Mahila Congress and the poster girl of AICC general secretary (UP) Priyanka Vadra’s “Ladki hoon lad sakti hoon” campaign Priyanka Maurya also joined the BJP on Thursday after being denied a ticket in her party.

However, it said the challenge to the validity of criteria for determining the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota would be heard and decided by it in the third week of March. The order came on petitions challenging reservation for OBC and EWS candidates introduced by the Centre in the AIQ seats in state government-run medical colleges through a notification dated July 29, 2021.High score not proxy for meritHigh scores in an exam are not a proxy for merit. Merit should be socially contextualised…. Reservation is not at odds with merit, but furthers its distributive consequences. —Justice DY Chandrachud“Merit cannot be reduced to narrow definitions of performance in an open competitive examination which only provides formal equality of opportunity. Competitive examinations assess basic current competency to allocate educational resources but are not reflective of excellence, capabilities and potential of an individual which are also shaped by live experiences, subsequent training and individual character. Crucially, open competitive examinations do not reflect the social, economic and cultural advantage that accrues to certain classes and contributes to their success in such examinations,” it said.“An oppositional paradigm of merit and reservation serves to entrench inequalities by relegatingreserved candidates to the sphere of incompetence, and diminishing their capabilities,” it noted.“In our opinion, it cannot be said that the impact of backwardness simply disappears because a candidate has a graduate qualification. Indeed, a graduate qualification may provide certain social and economic mobility, but that by itself does not create parity between forward classes and backward classes. In any event, there cannot be an assertion of over-inclusion where undeserving candidates are said to be benefitting from reservation because OBC candidates who fall in the creamy layer are excluded from taking the benefit of reservation. Thus, we find that there is no prohibition in introducing reservation for socially and educationally backward classes (or the OBCs) in PG courses,” it said.“High scores in an examination are not a proxy for merit. Merit should be socially contextualised and reconceptualised as an instrument that advances social goods like equality that we as a society value. In such a context, reservation is not at odds with merit but furthers its distributive consequences,” it said.Noting that “scores in an exam are not the sole determinant of excellence or capability,” the Bench said, “Even if for the sake of argument, it is assumed that scores do reflect excellence, it is not the only value that is considered as a social good. We must look at the distributive consequences of merit. Accordingly, how we assess merit should also encapsulate if it mitigates or entrenches inequalities.”The Bench – which had on January 7 passed a short order upholding the 27 per cent quota for OBCs in AIQ seats – has now delivered a detailed verdict giving reasons for its decision.                                     #NEET                                     #OBC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reservation-not-at-odds-with-merit-sc-upholds-27-obc-quota-in-neet-362994

21-01-2022||New Delhi||Daughters to inherit fathers' self acquired, inherited properties, to get preference over others: SC||In a significant verdict, the Supreme Court on Thursday said the daughters of a male Hindu, dying intestate, would be entitled to inherit the self-acquired and other properties obtained in the partition by the father and get preference over other collateral members of the family.The judgement, which came on an appeal against the Madras High Court verdict, dealt with the property rights of Hindu women and widows under the Hindu Succession Act.“If a property of a male Hindu dying intestate (without a will) is a self-acquired property or obtained in the partition of a coparcenary or a family property, the same would devolve by inheritance and not by survivorship, and a daughter of such a male Hindu would be entitled to inherit such property in preference to other collaterals (such as sons/daughters of brothers of deceased father),” a bench of justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari said.The bench was dealing with the legal issue concerning the right of the daughter to inherit the self-acquired property of her father, in the absence of any other legal heir.Justice Murari, writing the 51-page judgment for the bench, also dealt with the question of whether such property will devolve on to the daughter upon the death of her father, who died without a will, by inheritance or shall devolve on to “father’s brother’s son by survivorship”.“Right of a widow or daughter to inherit the self-acquired property or share received in the partition of a coparcenary property of a Hindu male dying intestate is well recognized not only under the old customary Hindu Law but also by various judicial pronouncements...,” the verdict said.Referring to the legal provision, it said the legislative intent was to remedy the limitation of a Hindu woman who could not claim an absolute interest in the properties inherited by her but only had a life interest in the estate so inherited.“Section 14 (I) converted all limited estates owned by women into absolute estates and the succession of these properties in the absence of a will or testament would take place in consonance with Section 15 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956...,” it said.If a female Hindu dies intestate without leaving any issue, then the property inherited by her from her father or mother would go to the heirs of her father whereas the property inherited from her husband or father-in-law would go to the heirs of the husband, it said.“The basic aim of the legislature in enacting Section 15(2) (of the Hindu Succession Act) is to ensure that inherited property of a female Hindu dying issueless and intestate, goes back to the source,” it said.Dealing with the facts of the case, the bench set aside the trial court and the high court’s findings dismissing the partition suit of the daughters.The apex court said, “...since the property in question was admittedly the self-acquired property of a father despite the family being in a state of jointness upon his death intestate, his sole surviving daughter will inherit the same by inheritance and the property shall not devolve by survivorship.“Thus, the impugned judgement and decree dated March 01, 1994, passed by the Trial Court and confirmed by the High Court vide judgment and order dated January 21, 2009, are not liable to be sustained and are hereby set aside,” it said.                                      #HinduSuccessionAct                                     #Hinduwomen                                     #MadrasHighCourt                                     #selfacquiredproperties                                     #SupremeCourt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/daughters-to-inherit-fathers-self-acquired-inherited-properties-to-get-preference-over-others-sc-362988

Children aged 12 years and over should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults. Ensure hands are kept clean with soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub, while handling masks,” it says, noting that while available data from other countries suggests that disease caused by the Omicron variant was less severe, there was need for a careful watch.Issuing antimicrobial use guide, the ministry said Covid-19 was a viral infection and antimicrobials have no role in the management of uncomplicated Covid-19 infection.“For asymptomatic and mild cases, antimicrobials are not recommended for therapy or prophylaxis; for moderate and severe cases, antimicrobials should not be prescribed unless there is clinical suspicion of a superadded infection,” the ministry said.It added that anticoagulants should not be routinely used but all hospitalised children should be evaluated for risk of developing thrombosis and monitored for development of thrombosis and addressed accordingly.                                     #antivirals                                     #coronavirus                                     #Covidguidance                                     #HealthMinistry                                     #infection                                     #monoclonalantibodies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/masks-not-recommended-for-children-aged-5-and-under-new-covid-guide-on-children-362984
21-01-2022||Satya Prakash||Reservation not at odds with merit, says SC as it upholds 27 pc OBC quota in NEET||New Delhi, January 20The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the 27 per cent quota for Other Backward Classes in National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) All India Quota seats for admission to PG medical and dental courses in state-run colleges, saying reservation was not at odds with merit as it furthered distributive justice.A Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said admissions to the NEET PG courses for the year 2021 will be held as per the existing reservation of 27 per cent for OBCs and 10 per cent for EWS.However, it said the challenge to the validity of criteria for determining the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota will be heard and decided by it in the third week of March.The order came on petitions challenging reservation for OBC and EWS candidates introduced by the Centre in the AIQ seats in state government-run medical colleges through a notification dated July 29, 2021.“Merit cannot be reduced to narrow definitions of performance in an open competitive examination which only provides formal equality of opportunity. Competitive examinations assess basic current competency to allocate educational resources but are not reflective of excellence, capabilities and potential of an individual which are also shaped by lived experiences, subsequent training and individual character. Crucially, open competitive examinations do not reflect the social, economic and cultural advantage that accrues to certain classes and contributes to their success in such examinations,” it said.“An oppositional paradigm of merit and reservation serves to entrench inequalities by relegating reserved candidates to the sphere of incompetence, and diminishing their capabilities,” it noted.“In our opinion, it cannot be said the impact of backwardness simply disappears because a candidate has a graduate qualification. Indeed, a graduate qualification may provide certain social and economic mobility, but that by itself does not create parity between forward classes and backward classes. In any event, there cannot be an assertion of over-inclusion where undeserving candidates are said to be benefitting from reservation because OBC candidates who fall in the creamy layer are excluded from taking the benefit of reservation. Thus, we find that there is no prohibition in introducing reservation for socially and educationally backward classes (or the OBCs) in PG courses,” it said.“High scores in an examination are not a proxy for merit. Merit should be socially contextualized and reconceptualized as an instrument that advances social goods like equality that we as a society value. In such a context, reservation is not at odds with merit but furthers its distributive consequences,” it said.Maintaining that there was no constitutional basis to subscribe to the binary of merit and reservation, the top court said, “If open examinations present equality of opportunity to candidates to compete, reservations ensure that the opportunities are distributed in such a way that backward classes are equally able to benefit from such opportunities which typically evade them because of structural barriers.”“This is the only manner in which merit can be a democratizing force that equalises inherited disadvantages and privileges. Otherwise claims of individual merit are nothing but tools of obscuring inheritances that underlie achievements,” it said.Noting that “scores in an exam are not the sole determinant of excellence or capability,” the Bench said, “Even if for the sake of argument, it is assumed that scores do reflect excellence, it is not the only value that is considered as a social good. We must look at the distributive consequences of merit. Accordingly, how we assess merit should also encapsulate if it mitigates or entrenches inequalities.”Clarifying the constitutional position, the top court said, “Articles 15(4) and 15 (5) are not an exception to Article 15 (1), which itself sets out the principle of substantive equality (including the recognition of existing inequalities). Thus, Articles 15 (4) and 15 (5) become a restatement of a particular facet of the rule of substantive equality that has been set out in Article 15 (1).”The Bench – which had on January 7 passed a short order upholding the 27 per cent quota for OBCs in AIQ seats – has now delivered a detailed verdict giving reasons for its decision.                                     #dental                                     #doctor                                     #medical                                     #NEET                                     #OBCquota                                     #SupremeCourt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-upholds-27-pc-obc-reservation-in-neet-all-india-quota-362979

The high court, however, had rejected the submissions.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Goa government, had argued that the judgement (of acquittal of Tejpal) by the district court is in the public domain.“Section 327 applies for the purpose of inquiring into or trying any offence. It has limited application during inquiry or trial. The appeal is something very clear. Appeals, revisions, etc are neither investigation nor inquiry nor a trial,” he had said.In its order in May last year, the Mapusa district and sessions court had held that the complainant had not shown the “kind of normative behaviour” expected from a “victim of sexual assault”.The court had granted Tejpal the “benefit of the doubt” in the absence of corroborative evidence to support the allegations made by the complainant.Challenging Tejpal’s acquittal, the state government had said that the court’s judgement was “coloured by prejudice and patriarchy”.                                      #BombayHighCourt                                     #rapecase                                     #SupremeCourt                                     #TarunTejpal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-hear-plea-of-journalist-tejpal-for-in-camera-hearing-of-appeal-in-sexual-assault-case-362965

At that time the proportion of fully vaccinated was 2 pc.Today as of Thursday, there are 317532 new cases, 380 deaths, 19,24,051 active cases and the proportion of fully vaccinated is 72 pc.“Current surge in India is not witnessing an increase in severe illness and deaths following high vaccinations. Because of high vaccine uptake we are not witnessing severe disease and death. However those with comorbidities should watch their health. Data show that vaccines prevent deaths,” ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said today.Member Health NITI Aayog VK Paul said mortality in India remains low due to high vaccinations -- 94 pc adults have received at least one dose and 72 pc both doses.Paul said 6.5 crore Indians are overdue for their second dose and must accept the shots for safety.Meanwhile, health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the analysis of two waves had revealed two things—in comparison with the second wave, deaths as a proportion of active cases has significantly reduced in the current surge and vaccinated people have also significantly increased.So far as the nature of the current surge goes, the analysis of cases in Delhi shows that while bed occupancy had remained significantly high in Delhi from April 1 to almost May 20 2021 during the second wave, this time it is nearly stable.Today the positivity rate in Delhi is rising but as compared to the second surge, hospitalised patients or those in need of beds is significantly lower.Also in the current surge, around 99 pc adult patients admitted to hospitals have common symptoms of fever with or without shivers; cough, irritation in throat usually settles after the fifth day, muscular weakness and tiredness.Pediatric patients aged 11 to 18 year olds have fever as a common symptom along with upper tract respiratory infection which is not entering lungs.Covid pneumonia cases due to entry to lungs are also very less in the current surge.                                     #Covidmortality                                     #HealthMinistry                                     #India                                     #secondwave                                     #thirdwave                                     #vaccine||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-deaths-in-third-wave-majorly-lower-than-second-due-to-high-vaccine-uptake-362953

Mulayam ji’s condition in SP is not good,” said Gupta who was unlikely to be fielded by Akhilesh in the elections.Gupta’s switch to the BJP comes a day after Mulayam Singh’s daughter in law Aparna Yadav joined the saffron ranks with UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya taunting Akhilesh for being unable to even keep his family together.Akhilesh downplayed Aparna’s defection wishing her well and saying that Mulayam Singh tried hard to talk her out of it.The BJP is also said to be in constant touch with Mulayam Singh’s brother Shivpal Yadav, in attempts to woo SP chief’s immediate family members.Priyanka Maurya, meanwhile, switched over to BJP from the Congress after being denied a ticket.She is UP Mahila Congress Vice President and the poster girl of AICC general Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s “ladki hoon lad sakti hoon” campaign.Maurya’s switch over is a huge embarrassment for the Congress and it’s probably women pitch in UP.                                     #BJP                                     #Congress                                     #Mulayam                                     #UPelections||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mulayams-brother-in-law-face-of-cong-campaign-join-bjp-362915
