The Prime Minister appreciated the high rate of testing and vaccination in the state which is higher than the national average,” the CM was quoted as saying by his office in a release.Noting that the PM was also apprised about measures initiated to ramp up the medical infrastructure, he said, “I sought the central assistance to raise the oxygenated beds and oxygen plants.” The Prime Minister gave instructions on making all preparations based on the experience of the first and second wave of Covid, as the pandemic is expected to peak in February, the CM said.During the third wave over 94 per cent infected are in home isolation, and therefore the Prime Minister wanted to give priority to ensuring supply of medicines, appropriate care and measures to instill a sense of confidence among the infected, he said.Further Bommai said, the Union government has suggested ramping up testing, purchase of ambulances and improving medical infrastructure under the Rs 32,000 crore package it has provided.“The union government has provided Rs 32,000 crore for states after the second wave to raise the health infrastructure. Many states have so far not utilised it. States too need to chip in with their own share of resources to improve the health infrastructure like ICU, Oxygen plants, oxygenated plants and purchase ambulances to make best use of the project,” he said.According to the release, Modi appreciated the 5T plan of Testing, Tracking, Tracing, Triaging and Technology adopted by the state government to control Covid, and also praised the use of technology for monitoring the health of those in home isolation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-seeks-central-assistance-to-raise-the-number-of-oxygenated-beds-and-oxygen-plants-360994

Some of the bogies had gotten detached from the rest of the train under the impact, while some wheels came off.“It was around 5 pm; I was speaking to my wife over the phone. All of a sudden, I heard a loud sound and there was a heavy jerk. I was thrown away from my berth and went blank. Later, when I regained consciousness, I was being taken inside an ambulance,” Sanjoy, a survivor, told a news channel.Some of the survivors were searching for their near and dear ones who were with them inside the train when the accident happened.“My mother and I were having tea, when all of a sudden there was a sound followed by a severe shock and luggage kept on upper berths tumbled all around. The locals later rescued me, but I am yet to locate my mother. I don’t know what happened to her,” said another injured person.“We recovered three bodies from the accident site while two people died in the hospital,” Jalpaiguri District Magistrate Moumita Godara Basu said, adding at least 45 passengers were injured in the accident.Manohar Pal, a local who was one of the first to reach the spot and take part in the rescue operations, said he was with his friends at a tea stall when they heard a loud sound.“We initially thought it was some sort of a blast. But as we rushed towards the source of the sound, we saw train coaches mangled with each other. We heard people screaming from the derailed coaches. We immediately tried to pull them out,” he said.The district magistrate said the death toll may go up as some of the injured passengers are in critical condition.Rescuers are thoroughly searching each coach for survivors and bodies through darkness and thick fog, Basu said.The Commissioner, Railway Safety, will conduct an inquiry into the cause of the accident, a railway official said in New Delhi.Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, Railway Board Chairman and Director General (Safety) are also leaving for the accident site.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-loud-sound-a-jerk-and-everything-went-blank-train-accident-survivors-recount-experience-360993

The next day, the family members were shocked when they saw Munda's lifeless body not only started to move but he regained his speech too," said Dr Albela Kerketta, the in-charge of Peterwar Community Health Centre.Bokaro's Civil Surgeon Dr Jitendra Kumar said a three-member medical team has been constituted to examine the "miraculous recovery".Munda was totally bedridden for the last one year with spine problems, doctors said.After receiving the first dose of Covishield -- the anti-COVID vaccine, he not only stood up and started walking, but could also speak, much to the astonishment of his family, they said."We saw his reports. This is a matter of investigation," Dr Kerketta said.Munda, the sole bread earner of his family, was critically injured in the road accident."This is a surprising incident. We will analyse his medical history," Civil Surgeon Dr Kumar said. Astonished villagers of Salgadih, about 50 km from the district headquarters, termed it a divine intervention.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bedridden-man-in-jharkhand-starts-walking-speaking-after-covishield-dose-doctors-360983

This case will now go before the full Senate. Garcetti was named the new envoy for India in July last year.US Secretary of the State Antony Blinken has described this as a “huge problem’’. Under the Biden administration, only 16 per cent of ambassadors have been confirmed whereas, at this point in the last three administrations, the number was between 70 and 90 percent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/old-india-hand-is-new-russian-envoy-360962
13-01-2022||---||US dilemma over sanctioning India for buying Russian arms||New Delhi, January 13The US has expressed its dilemma over considering sanctions for India’s purchase of Russia’s S-400 missile defence systems.“I think we’ve to look at what the balance is... The administration made clear that it is discouraging India from proceeding with the acquisitions of Russian equipment and there are important geostrategic considerations particularly with relationship to China,” said James O’Brien, US President Joe Biden’s nominee as Coordinator for Sanctions Policy over Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).“It’s difficult to compare the two situations – a NATO ally (Turkey) that is breaking with legacy and India, a partner of growing importance, but that has legacy relationships with Russia,” added O’Brien James while speaking before the US Senate at his confirmation hearing for the post.Turkey, India and China have purchased the S-400 systems but only companies from Turkey and China have been sanctioned under CAATSA, a US domestic law introduced during the Trump era, India has so far not been acted against.India had signed a $ 5 billion deal in October 2018 with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems though the US administration had warned that such a move may attract sanctions. But in recent times, US Senators have also started flagging India’s purchase of naval warships from Russia.Asked about the possibility of US sanctions for buying the S-400 missile systems, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had said in November last year that ,“India pursues an independent foreign policy and its defence acquisitions are guided by its national security interests.’’The two Senators, Mark Warner and John Cornyn, have said that though India has signed a deal with Russia for the purchase of the S-400 missile system but such transactions were on a decline. A Congressional Research Service (CRS) report has noted that, “the Indian military cannot operate effectively without Russian-supplied equipment and will continue to rely on its weapons systems in the near and middle terms”.When it comes to the crunch, New Delhi may not need the helping hand of the two co-chairs of the India Caucus in the US Senate as External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said in 2019, “I am reasonably convinced of the powers of my persuasion. It would be my hope that people understand why this transaction is important for us.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-dilemma-over-sanctioning-india-for-buying-russian-arms-360959

13-01-2022||Aditi Tandon||Anti-CAA activist Sadaf Jafar in Congress's first list of 125 UP candidates||New Delhi, January 13Anti-Citizenship Amendment Act-NRC activist Sadaf Jafar, Unnao rape victim’s mother Asha Singh, ASHA leader Poonam Pandey and Sonbhadra’s tribal leader Rajram Gonda have made it to the first list of 125 candidates the Congress announced on Thursday morning.The list of 125 candidates has 50 women – 40 per cent – as promised earlier by AICC general secretary in charge of the state Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who unveiled the names of the 50 women.Fielding women candidates, Vadra said it was not about creating new vote banks. “It is only about giving women what is absolutely their right. Women make up 50 per cent of the population and have every right of equal participation in electoral politics.”Vadra, however, skipped a question on whether she would contest herself in the upcoming UP election that begins on February 10 and sufficed to say, “Even after the elections, I will continue to work in UP and in other states, as the party wants me to.”The first list of the Congress is replete with people seen protesting on the roads of Uttar Pradesh over the recent years and includes Asha Singh from Unnao, Sadaf Jafar from Lucknow Central, Rajraj Gonda from Obra, ASHA worker Poonam Pandey from Shahjahanpur, Alpana Nishad from Allahabad South and Ritu Singh. Ritu Singh recently made news when she was prevented from filing her nomination for the block president’s election in UP. She has been fielded from Mohammdi segment in UP.UP Congress chief Ajay Lallu will contest from Tamkuhi Raj, CLP leader Aradhna Mishra from Rampur Khas and former union minister Salman Khurshid’s wife Louis Khurshid will contest from Farrukhabad. Former Bareilly mayor Supriya Aron has been fielded from Bareilly Cantt.Naming the women candidates, Vadra said the aim behind fielding women was to help them “take their fight in their own hands and continue to struggle against the system that seeks to muzzle them”.Vadra made light of the recent serial defections from the Congress, including of three MLAs who joined the BJP on Wednesday and of Saharanpur leader Imran Masood, saying, “Aaya Ram Gaya Ram is a natural phenomenon before any election. I do not think any party should worry too much about defections. Ours is an ideological struggle and the fight is in a phase where we need courage and resilience. People do get anxious thinking of victories and defeats but you cannot help it in politics.”Asked to comment on UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s 80-20 remarks in attempts to polarise the elections, Vadra said the Congress would not resort to negative campaigning in UP.“We have to steer election narratives in a more positive direction. Look at the level of our health spending, look at our education expenditure. It is much easier to mobilise people on hate. It is difficult to mobilise people on a positive agenda. In UP and India we need to have a more constructive discussion on politics and I am happy to be a part of that dialogue,” said Vadra, adding that the party would soon start door-to-door campaigns in UP.Vadra said the Congress would stress positive issues, issues of the future, issues of development, women's empowerment, and the advancement of SCs.“We want unity in UP, equality, and a solution to the problems of the state,” Vadra said, adding that through Thursday’s list the Congress is giving the message that service of society is and should be the principal motivation behind politics.Ours is a mixed list with old timers and new faces, she said.The Congress leader added that their decision to project women leaders had already become a success.“The PM had to do a women-specific rally in UP. Yogi Adityanath had to make women-specific announcements, the SP chief and BSP chief had to do the same. We have already brought women into electoral discussions. Today in UP elections, women cannot be ignored by any party. This is our success. Now we will raise issues of development - health, education, employment, social empowerment and bring them centre stage,” she said.Congress UP candidatesAsha Singh: Mother of the Unnao rape victim whose struggle for justice continues as her husband was killed, her brother-in-law is in jail and daughter sexually assaulted and threatenedPoonam Pandey: ASHA worker fighting for raise in remunerationsRitu Singh: Assaulted by BJP workers when she recently tried to file nomination for block chief pollSadaf Jafar: Arrested and jailed for anti CAA-NRC protests in LucknowRajram Gonda: Led the fight of Sonbhadra tribals, whom Priyanka supportedSupriya Aron: Former Bereilly mayorLouis Khurshid: Wife of former union minister Salman KhurshidArchana Mishra: Sitting CLP leader in UP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anti-caa-activist-sadaf-jafar-unnao-rape-victims-mother-in-congress-first-up-list-of-125-candidates-360931
13-01-2022||Washington||US discourages India from acquiring Russian S-400 missile defence systems: Prez Biden’s nominee||The US has made clear to India that it is “discouraging” it from proceeding with its acquisition of S-400 missile defence systems from Russia but Washington will have to weigh “important geostrategic considerations” while taking a decision on growing calls for a presidential CAATSA waiver to New Delhi, President Joe Biden’s nominee for Coordinator for Sanctions Policy has told lawmakers.In October 2018, India signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, despite a warning from the then Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions.The Biden administration has not yet clarified whether it will impose sanctions on India under the provisions of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for procuring the S-400 missile systems.CAATSA is a tough US law that was brought in 2017 and authorises the US administration to impose sanctions on countries that purchase major defence hardware from Russia.James O’Brien, President Biden’s nominee for the US State Department’s coordinator for sanctions policy was asked at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday if the US experience with Turkey provided any warning or lessons on how to proceed with India.The US has already imposed sanctions on Turkey under the CAATSA for the purchase of a batch of S-400 missile defence systems from Russia.Following the US sanctions on Turkey over the procurement of S-400 missile systems, there were apprehensions that Washington may impose similar punitive measures on India. Russia has been one of India’s key major suppliers of arms and ammunition.“I believe they are very different circumstances, and, of course, different security partnerships—but how do you believe we should think about the possibility of sanctioning our friends and not just threats?” Senator Todd Young asked O’Brien, a former career employee of the State Department.In response, O’Brien said it was difficult to compare the two situations, with a NATO ally that is breaking with legacy defence procurement systems, and then with India, a partner of growing importance, but that has legacy relationships with Russia.“The administration has made clear that it is discouraging India from proceeding with the acquisitions of Russian equipment, and there are important geostrategic considerations, particularly with (unintelligible) relationship to China. So, I think we have to look at what the balance is,” he said.“And, of course, India’s got some decisions in front of it, so it would be premature to say more. But this is something I look forward to working with you and other interested members,” O’Brien said.India pursues an independent foreign policy and its defence acquisitions are guided by its national security interests, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in November last year, amid apprehensions over the possibility of US sanctions on New Delhi over the procurement of S-400 missile systems from Russia.The S-400 is known as Russia’s most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system.Senator Young said India was currently taking delivery of the Russian S-400 system and was also in the process of acquiring new frigate ships from Russia.“Both are important systems for the Indians,” he said.“India is a vital ally in our competition against China, and thus, I believe we should resist taking any actions that might drive them away from us and the Quad. I am therefore strongly supportive of waiving CAATSA sanctions against India, given our shared foreign policy interests,” he said.“As most here know, the Indians have a lot of legacy systems from previous decades, and they are interoperable with the Russians’ systems. And the Indians seek to defend their land border from Chinese incursions and defend the Indian Ocean from an increasingly adventurous and lawless blue ocean navy in the People’s Liberation Army,” he said.Quad - comprising Japan, India, Australia and the United States - is a grouping of four countries. In November 2017, the four countries gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the “Quad” to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.In the midst of growing global concern over China’s expansionist behaviour, the foreign ministers of the Quad member nations met in Tokyo on October 6 and reaffirmed their collective vision for a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.There are growing calls in the US urging the Biden administration to grant the CAATSA waiver to India.In October last year, two powerful US Senators -- Mark Warner of the Democratic Party and John Cornyn of the Republican Party -- had urged President Biden not to impose provisions of CAATSA against India for buying the S-400 missile system, arguing that it was in America’s national security interest.“We strongly encourage you to grant a CAATSA waiver to India for its planned purchase of the S-400 Triumf surface-to-air missile system. In cases where granting a waiver would advance the national security interests of the US, this waiver authority, as written into the law by Congress, allows the President additional discretion in applying sanctions,” they wrote in a letter to Biden.Both Warner, Chairman of the Senate Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and Cornyn, Senate Minority Whip for the Grand Old Party (GOP), are co-chairs of the powerful Senate India caucus, the only country-specific caucus in the US Senate.Talking about his visit to India, Senator Tommy Tuberville said, “I was heartened that Prime Minister Modi not only committed the continuing support of our Freedom of Navigation Operations but that India will increase them”.Tuberville is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “Visited the Philippines, Guam, Taiwan, and India. Purpose: listen to our allies and see firsthand the threat China poses to its neighbours, free trade, and democracy. We also discussed the region’s response to COVID,” he had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-discourages-india-from-acquiring-russian-s-400-missile-defence-systems-prez-bidens-nominee-360925
13-01-2022||New Delhi||Failure of builder to obtain occupation certificate is deficiency in service: SC||Failure of a builder to obtain occupation certificate is a deficiency in service under Consumer Protection Act 1986, the Supreme Court has said.A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and A S Bopanna held that the builder would be liable to refund money if the homebuyers were forced to pay higher taxes and water charges due to lack of an occupancy certificate.The apex court was hearing an appeal against an order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which dismissed a complaint by a cooperative housing society seeking refund of the excess taxes and charges paid to the municipal authorities due to alleged deficiency of the builder.The NCDRC had dismissed the complaint on the ground that it was barred by limitation and that it was not maintainable since it was in the nature of a recovery proceeding and not a consumer dispute.According to the petitioner society, the builder failed to take steps to obtain the occupation certificate from the municipal authorities.In the absence of the occupation certificate, individual flat owners were not eligible for electricity and water connections, it said.Due to the efforts of the society, temporary water and electricity connections were granted by the authorities, however, the members of the appellant had to pay property tax at a rate 25 per cent higher than the normal rate and water charges at a rate which was per cent higher than the normal charge.The top court set aside the NCDRC’s order which had turned down society’s plea against the builder and held they should approach against the authorities which are charging higher taxes.“In the present case, the respondent was responsible for transferring the title to the flats to the society along with the occupancy certificate. The failure of the respondent to obtain the occupation certificate is a deficiency in service for which the respondent is liable.“Thus, the members of the appellant society are well within their rights as ‘consumers’ to pray for compensation as a recompense for the consequent liability (such as payment of higher taxes and water charges by the owners) arising from the lack of an occupancy certificate,” the bench said in a recent order.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/failure-of-builder-to-obtain-occupation-certificate-is-deficiency-in-service-sc-360924

The patrol team saw the RWABEE vessel from a distance and spoke to its crew members,” the UN Mission to support the Hudaydah Agreement (UNMHA) said in a tweet on Wednesday.“The UNMHA patrol team also visited a fish market and a local school in As Salif to interact with the local population. No indication of militarisation was observed in the areas patrolled,” it said.India has called for the immediate release of the seven Indian crew members on board the United Arab Emirates-flagged cargo vessel Rawabi that was seized by Houthis off the port of Hodeidah in Yemen earlier this month.India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti, speaking at a UN Security Council meeting on Yemen on Wednesday, expressed grave concern over the seizure and detention of the UAE vessel Rawabi.Tirumurti “called for the immediate release of 7 Indian crew members, expressed deep concern about their safety & well-being & that Houthis should ensure their safety till release.”  India also called upon all parties to the conflict to immediately cease fighting, de-escalate the situation and engage unconditionally with the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen.The External Affairs Ministry said Tuesday that all seven Indian sailors onboard a United Arab Emirates-flagged cargo vessel that was seized by Houthis off the port of Hodeidah in Yemen are safe and the government is making all efforts to secure their early release.Arindam Bagchi, the spokesperson in the ministry, said India has been closely monitoring developments following the seizure of the UAE flagged ship Rwabee by the Houthis on January 2.“We also understand from the company and other sources that all Indian crew members are safe. The government of India is making all efforts to secure their early release,” Bagchi said.The Houthi rebels have a strong presence in parts of Yemen.“We are in touch with the company operating the ship and have been informed that out of the 11 crew members onboard the ship, seven are from India,” Bagchi said while replying to a media query in New Delhi.“We urge the Houthis to ensure the safety and well-being of the crew members and release them immediately. India is concerned at the recent intensification of fighting in Yemen and hopes that all parties will come to the negotiating table to find a peaceful resolution to the Yemen issue,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/un-mission-speaks-to-crew-members-of-uae-flagged-vessel-seized-by-houthis-with-7-indians-on-board-360921

Cases are increasing but the hospital admission rate has not increased in the same proportion. The hospital admission rate when 27,000 cases are being reported is the same as the time when 10,000 cases were logged. The stable hospital admission rate is an indication that the wave has plateaued," he told reporters.Delhi reported 27,561 Covid cases, the second-highest single-day rise since the pandemic began, and 40 deaths on Wednesday while the positivity rate rose to 26.22 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-cases-in-delhi-on-rise-hospital-admissions-stabilised-health-minister-360917

It ensures the reliability and robustness of the cryogenic engine for induction into the human-rated launch vehicle for Gaganyaan”, an ISRO statement said.Further, this engine will undergo four more tests for a cumulative duration of 1,810 seconds, it said.Subsequently, ISRO said, one more engine will undergo two short-duration tests and one long-duration test to complete the cryogenic engine qualification for Gaganyaan Programme.ISRO Chairman K Sivan said earlier this month India’s flagship Gaganyaan project has completed the design phase and entered into the testing phase.“There is a directive to launch the first unmanned mission before 75th anniversary of India’s independence (August 15, 2022) and all the stake-holders are putting their best effort to meet the schedule.

However, with a dedicated vote share it has the potential to spoil the chances of many.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-poll-panel-to-finalise-up-candidates-list-expected-on-makar-sakranti-360906

If confirmed by the Senate, Garcetti, 50, would replace Kenneth Juster, who served as the US Ambassador to India during the Trump administration. Juster was appointed as a distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in July.Besides Garcetti, the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday endorsed 11 other ambassadorial nominations, including Amy Gutmann to be the US Ambassador to Germany, Donald Armin Blome to be the Ambassador to Pakistan and Joe Donnelly to be the envoy to the Holy See.The nominations now move to the Senate floor for a final confirmation vote."It is bipartisan that these vacancies be filled whichever party is in control of the White House," Ranking Member Jim Risch said.Senator Bob Menendez, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, rued that over 55 nominees were still pending before the committee and many challenges around the world are awaiting them.After Biden's nomination, Garcetti had said he was honoured to accept the nomination and would bring the same energy, commitment and love with which he served the sprawling city to his new role in the world's largest democracy."Today, the President announced that I am his nominee to serve as US Ambassador to India. I am honoured to accept his nomination to serve in this role," Garcetti, a Democrat, had said in a statement soon after Biden announced his nomination.He has travelled several times to India, most recently as a councilman. In college, he spent a year studying Hindi and Urdu.“It's the largest democracy in the world, soon to be the most populous country in the world, one of the top handful of superpowers in the world,” Garcetti said.“We can't get our climate goals without India hitting its climate goals. We can't see the economy truly reopened to international commerce and tourism until Covid is under control. We're all very closely connected,” he told the Los Angeles Times in an interview.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/key-congressional-panel-clears-nomination-of-los-angeles-mayor-as-us-envoy-to-india-360900

13-01-2022||Washington||Republican senator supports waiving CAATSA sanctions against India||Arguing that the Biden Administration should resist from any action that might drive New Delhi away from Quad, a top Republican senator supported waiving of CAATSA sanctions against India for purchase of S-400 missile systems from Russia.India, Senator Todd Young said, is currently taking delivery of the Russian S-400 system. The country is also in the process of acquiring new frigate ships from Russia. "Both are important systems for the Indians," he said on Wednesday during a confirmation hearing for James O'Brien for the position of the State Department coordinator for Sanctions Policy."India is a vital ally in our competition against China, and thus, I believe we should resist taking any actions that might drive them away from us and the Quad. I am, therefore, strongly supportive of waiving CAATSA sanctions against India, given our shared foreign policy interests," Senator Young said."As most here know, the Indians have a lot of legacy systems from previous decades, and they are interoperable with the Russians' systems. And the Indians seek to defend their land border from Chinese incursions and defend the Indian Ocean from an increasingly adventurous and lawless blue ocean navy in the People's Liberation Army," he said.The Indiana senator asked O'Brien if the US experience with Turkey provided any warning or lessons on how to proceed with India."I believe they are very different circumstances, and, of course, different security partnerships -- but how do you believe we should think about the possibility of sanctioning our friends and not just threats," he asked.In response, O'Brien said it is difficult to compare the two situations, with a NATO ally that is breaking with legacy defence procurement systems, and then with India, a partner of growing importance, but that has legacy relationships with Russia."The administration has made clear that it is discouraging India from proceeding with the acquisitions of Russian equipment, and there are important geostrategic considerations, particularly with (unintelligible) relationship to China. So, I think we have to look at what the balance is. And, of course, India's got some decisions in front of it, so it would be premature to say more. But this is something I look forward to working with you and other interested members," O'Brien said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/republican-senator-supports-waiving-caatsa-sanctions-against-india-360894
13-01-2022||London||UK launches free trade agreement negotiations with India||The UK government on Thursday announced the launch of free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations with India, describing it as a "golden opportunity" to put British businesses at the "front of the queue" of the Indian economy.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said an FTA would take the country's historic partnership with India to the next level, and highlighted Scotch whisky, financial services and cutting-edge renewable technology among some of the key sectors set to benefit.The first round of negotiations is expected to start next week which, the British government said, would make it the UK's quickest start of formal talks between negotiating teams following a launch."A trade deal with India's booming economy offers huge benefits for British businesses, workers and consumers. As we take our historic partnership with India to the next level, the UK's independent trade policy is creating jobs, increasing wages and driving innovation across the country," Johnson said."The UK has world-class businesses and expertise we can rightly be proud of, from Scotch whisky distillers to financial services and cutting-edge renewable technology. We are seizing the opportunities offered in growing economies of the Indo-Pacific to cement our place on the global stage and deliver jobs and growth at home," he said.Johnson's statement came as his Secretary of State for International Trade, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, prepared to meet with Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal in New Delhi for the 15th UK-India Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO) to review the progress within the UK-India Enhanced Trade Partnership agreed to last May by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Johnson."A deal with India is a golden opportunity to put UK businesses at the front of the queue as the Indian economy continues to grow rapidly," Trevelyan said."By 2050, India will be the world's third-largest economy with a middle class of almost 250 million shoppers. We want to unlock this huge new market for our great British producers and manufacturers across numerous industries from food and drinks to services and automotive," she said."As an independent, deal-making nation, the UK is broadening our economic horizons and forging stronger partnerships with the fastest-growing economies of the world. India marks the start of our ambitious five-star year of UK trade and will show how the deals we negotiate will boost the economies across all nations and help level up all regions of the UK," said the minister who is scheduled for bilateral talks with senior Indian Cabinet ministers before she concludes her two-day visit to the country on Thursday.An India-UK FTA is billed in the UK as creating huge benefits for both countries, with the potential to boost bilateral trade by up to GBP 28 billion a year by 2035 and increase wages by up to GBP 3 billion across the UK.A deal with India is also pegged as a "big step forward" in the UK's post-Brexit strategy to refocus trade on the Indo-Pacific, home to half of the world's population and 50 per cent of global economic growth.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-launches-free-trade-agreement-negotiations-with-india-360893

The emerging evidence would be constantly reviewed, he added.He added that the current window of application appeared extremely narrow for Molnupiravir with relevance only to the elderly and the unvaccinated with other co-morbidities except diabetes.The Health Ministry said the medicine was to be administered conditionally and was not to be given to people under 18 years. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/restrict-use-of-molnupiravir-pill-icmr-warns-again-360761

The situation has arisen due to the Military Service Pay being introduced in the Sixth and Seventh Central Pay Commission as part of basic pay of officers of the three services up to and including the rank of Brigadier and equivalent ranks in other services. Officers of the rank of Major General and above are not entitled MSP.Hence, a Major General and equivalent rank officer in the Air Force and Navy, after being promoted to the said rank, get lesser pay than Brigadier and consequently lesser pension after retirement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/18-major-generals-move-aft-over-pension-issue-360764

The petitioners have sought an “independent, credible and impartial investigation” by an SIT into the incidents of alleged hate speeches at the Dharam Sansad. On behalf of the petitioners, senior advocate Kapil Sibal urged the top court to stay the next Dharam Sansad scheduled to be held at Aligarh later this month and take up the matter on Monday for this purpose but the Bench didn’t pass any such orders.“We allow the petitioners to bring the case before the notice of the authorities and how it is against certain penal provisions,” the CJI told Sibal. On behalf of an intervener, senior advocate Indira Jaising said the guidelines laid down by the top court were not being followed.During the hearing, the Bench said similar issues were pending before another Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar and this petition should be sent to that Bench.However, it agreed to issue a notice to the Uttarakhand Government after Sibal insisted that his petition was specifically on the issue of hate speech at Haridwar Dharam Sansad.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/notice-to-centre-uttarakhand-over-hate-speeches-360740
13-01-2022||---||Marathon meeting on LAC resolution, Army Chief says PLA threat persists||New Delhi, January 12Military Commanders of India and China were locked in a marathon meeting on Wednesday to resolve the issues at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.The 14th round of Corps Commander-level talks on the border standoff were held on the Chinese side of the Chushul-Moldo meeting point. The talks started around 9.30 am and continued late into the night. There was no official statement on the dialogue till the filing of the report. The major focus of talks would be on disengagement in the Hot Springs area, called Patrolling Point 15, in eastern Ladakh. The issue of the Depsang Bulge, a 972-sq km plateau, would be taken up after the Hot Springs gets resolved.Not against Siachen demilitarisationWe are not averse to demilitarisation of Siachen Glacier. However, Pak must accept the Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL) before any disengagement takes place. —General NaravaneThe troop build-up on either side, for now, shows no signs of getting back to the pre-April 2020 levels.Meanwhile, Army Chief General MM Naravane said talks were important to resolve the border issues, though each round might not “have an outcome”.The threat level at the LAC “has not reduced” and force levels were more or less the same, he said at a press conference in the Capital ahead of Army Day (January 15). The Army Chief said: “We will continue to deal with the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) in a firm and resolute manner. The necessary safeguards are in place to deal with any contingency.”Speaking on how the future could pan out along the 3,488-km LAC, the Army Chief mentioned a three-step process to ease the standoff: disengagement of troops, de-escalation of tension followed by de-induction of all troops, weapons and equipment.“Till these steps are completed, we have to remain there (LAC),” General Naravane said, asserting that the Army had the highest level of operational preparedness along the LAC even as dialogue was on with China.To a question on India’s response to the standoff, he said the Army response had been robust to a PLA attempt to unilaterally change the status quo at the LAC.Lt Gen Anindya Sengupta, the newly appointed Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, led the Indian delegation at the talks. The Chinese team was to be headed by South Xinjiang Military District chief Maj Gen Yang Lin.The 13th round of talks, which took place on October 10, had ended in a stalemate.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/marathon-meeting-on-lac-resolution-army-chief-says-pla-threat-persists-360721

13-01-2022||Sultanpur (UP)||Arrest warrant issued against former UP minister Swami Prasad Maurya||A local court on Wednesday here issued an arrest warrant against BJP MLA Swami Prasad Maurya, who recently resigned as cabinet minister, in a seven-year-old case.The case was lodged against Maurya in 2014 for allegedly making objectionable comments against Hindu gods.The MP-MLA court Judge Yogesh Kumar Yadav issued the warrant against him after he did not attend the court hearing on Wednesday.In 2016, an arrest warrant was issued against him in the same case which was stayed by the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court.Issuing the warrant, the Judge fixed January 24 as the next date of hearing.The court had on January 6 directed Maurya to appear before it on January 12 but he did not appear, lawyer Anil Tiwari said.Maurya, an influential OBC leader, had resigned from the Yogi Adityanath cabinet on Tuesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arrest-warrant-issued-against-former-up-minister-swami-prasad-maurya-360681

The conclusion is that Molnupiravir has certain risks that warrant caution in its use. Experts present at the meeting opined that there is a rampant and irrational use of the pill. They said efforts should be made to restrict its use as known and unknown harms far outweigh its claimed benefit,” ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said today.He said currently available synthesized evidence was reviewed and members unanimously agreed that the medicine does not merit inclusion in the national Covid treatment guidelines.The emerging evidence will be constantly reviewed, ICMR chief said.He also said the current window of application appeared extremely narrow for Molnupiravir with relevance only to the elderly and the unvaccinated with other comorbidities except diabetes.“There was no evidence of benefit in diabetes, those previously infected with Covid 19 or those who were vaccinated,” said Bhargava.The health ministry said the medicine, approved by DCGI is to be administered conditionally and is not to be given to people under 18 years and to pregnant women. It has evidence of harm to the fetus and to genetic materials, said ICMR adding that even in the US where the medicine has been approved for use, its administration is conditional.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/molnupiravir-harms-far-outweigh-claimed-benefits-icmrs-second-warning-in-a-week-360680

All participants received an initial two-dose schedule of Covaxin on Day 0 and Day 28.“As the dominant Covid-19 variant throughout the world, Omicron poses a serious public health concern,” said Mehul Suthar, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Emory Vaccine Center and who led the laboratory analysis.“Data from this preliminary analysis show individuals receiving a booster dose of Covaxin have a significant immune response to both the Omicron and Delta variants. These findings suggest that a booster dose has the potential to reduce disease severity and hospitalisations,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bharat-biotech-says-covaxin-booster-shot-neutralises-omicron-variant-360676

Officers of the rank of Major General and above are not entitled MSP.As a result, a Major General and equivalent rank officer in the Air Force and Navy, after being promoted to the said rank, get lesser pay than Brigadier and consequently lesser pension after retirement.“This is against the fundamental canon of service jurisprudence. A senior rank official cannot be paid less salary than his junior in the same branch or service,” Col Singh said. “Army Headquarters is aware of this pay and pension anomaly and has, admittedly, already taken up a case with the defence ministry to resolve the anomaly, but to no avail so far,” he added.In two recent consecutive cases filed by officers of the rank of Air Vice Marshall (equivalent to of Major General), the Tribunal has already allowed their plea and directed the government to step-up their pay at par with that of Air Commodore (equivalent to Brigadier) and also upgrade their pension accordingly.“However, the government has treated the two judgements as ‘Judgement-in-personam’ and not as ‘Judgement-in-rem’, which implies that it is applicable to the individual petitioner and not to all similarly circumstanced personnel,” Col Singh told The Tribune. “This is contrary to the law as laid down by the Supreme Court in a number of judgements that once a judgement is passed and gains finality then the benefit of the same should be extended to all similarly situated individuals or groups without forcing them to knock at the doors of the courts separately,” he added.It may be recalled that a similar anomalous situation had arisen during implementation of the Fourthand Fifth CPC, which was ultimately resolved with intervention of the Punjab and Haryana High Court followed by an order passed by the Apex Court to this effect.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/18-major-generals-file-plea-on-getting-lower-pension-than-juniors-aft-seeks-explanation-from-govt-360665

Chauhan, who belongs to the Rajput community, said he would take the next step on the basis of his samaj's wishes.Soon after, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya tweeted asking Chauhan to reconsider his decision before boarding a “sinking boat”.While Chauhan did not reveal his next move, sources say he and other BJP MLAs who have resigned will join the Akhilesh Yadav- led SP around January 14 or 15. Apparently, around 12 to 14 more MLAs, including ministers, are expected to resign over the next couple of days.Chauhan was the forest and environment minister in the Uttar Pradesh government.BJP MLA from Meerapur constituency in Muzaffarnagar Avtar Singh Bhadana also switched to the Rashtriya Lok Dal today.In a major setback to the ruling BJP in Uttar Pradesh, top OBC leader, and state minister Swami Prasad Maurya yesterday resigned alleging “grave oppression of Dalits, OBCs, farmers, unemployed and small businessmen” under Adityanath.Three more MLAs, Roshan Lal Verma (Shahjahanpur), Brijesh Prajapati (Tindwari), and Bhagwati Sagar (Bilhaur) soon followed suit and quit the party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/more-trouble-for-bjp-another-up-minister-quits-adityanaths-cabinet-days-before-assembly-elections-360652
13-01-2022||New Delhi||Threat at LAC remains, says Indian Army chief General MM Naravane||Indian Army Chief General MM Naravane on Wednesday said that the threat levels at LAC (Line of Actual Control) “has not reduced”.“Force levels are more or less the same,” he said addressing a press conference ahead of the Army Day (January 15).Army Chief said: “We will continue to deal with PLA (People’s Liberation Army, China) in a firm and resolute manner. Necessary safeguards are in place to deal with any contingency”.Speaking on the future along the LAC, the Army Chief mentioned three-step process that is disengagement of troops, de-escalation of tensions followed by de-induction of all troops, weapons and equipment. “Till these steps are completed, we have to be remain there (the LAC), the Army Chief said.On the northern borders, he said, the Army has highest level of operational preparedness even as a dialogue is on with China.To a question on India’s response to the stand at the LAC, he said the Army response was robust to the PLA attempt to unilaterally change the status quo at LAC.“Our capabilities have increased manifold at the northern borders,” he added. “We are in much better position than what we were an year and a half ago and are much better prepared to deal with any situation,” General Naravane saidA conflict, he said, was the last resort but if it happens we will emerge victorious. The only long-term solution to resolve the border question, unless we have a settled boundary this (difference of opinion at where is the LAC) will keep happening.“There is no question that a status quo, as it exists today, can be altered with force,” he added.The threat assessment at the northern borders has led to re-organisation and Army has re-aligned forces to ensure territorial integrity and it caters to major augmentation of PLA forces. “We have undertaken reorganisation and rebalancing of forces. Re-orientation of additional forces to the Northern Borders, has been carried out, while retaining our punitive strike capability, along the Western Front”, the Chief said. The crisis at the LAC has been used an opportunity to fast-track infrastructure development, undertake doctrinal reviews and make-up operational voids, through Emergency and Fast Track Procurements, he said.The upgrade and development of infrastructure along the northern borders, is being carried out in a comprehensive manner, including roads and tunnels.Along the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan, the DGMOs understanding arrived at by both sides in February last year has witnessed marked improvement. However, concentration of terrorists—some 350 to 400—in launch pads and repeated infiltration attempts.“We, on our part, have resolved to show ‘Zero Tolerance’ to terror:” he said.On the incident of December 4 when civilian were killed in an operation of the Indian Army in Nagaland, the General said the incident is being thoroughly investigated. “Law of the land is paramount we will uphold that,” he added.Formation of Battle Groups is progressing well, eh said adding that Theatre commands are the way forward for future battles.Siachen glacierOn Siachen glacier, he said both sides (India and Pakistan) are face to face. “We are not averse to (demilitarisation).

13-01-2022||New Delhi||Disengagement at Hot Spring focus of 14th round of India-China military talks||India on Wednesday pressed for an early disengagement of troops in the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh at the 14th round of military talks with China, sources in the security establishment said.The fresh round of Corps Commander-level talks took place at the Chushul-Moldo border point on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, they said.The main focus of the talks was to carry forward the disengagement process at Hot Springs (Patrolling Point 15), the sources said.“The 14th round of the Corps Commander level talks is underway, and I am hopeful that you shall see further developments in the days ahead. But while there has been partial disengagement, the threat has by no means reduced,” Army Chief Gen MM Naravane said in the afternoon.He made the remarks while addressing a press conference ahead of the Army Day.The talks that began at 9.30 am are learnt to have continued till evening.The Indian delegation at the talks was led by Lt Gen Anindya Sengupta, the newly-appointed Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps. The Chinese team was to be headed by South Xinjiang Military District Chief Maj Gen Yang Lin.The Indian side also insisted on disengagement as soon as possible in all the remaining friction points, including resolution of issues in Depsang Bulge and Demchok.The 13th round of talks had taken place on October 10 and they ended in a stalemate.Both sides failed to make any headway in the talks with the Indian Army saying after the dialogue that the “constructive suggestions” made by it were neither agreeable to the Chinese side nor it could provide any “forward-looking” proposals.The fresh talks are taking place days after India hit out at China for building a bridge across Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh and said it is in an area that has been under illegal occupation of that country for around 60 years.Last week, India also described China’s renaming of some places in Arunachal Pradesh as a “ridiculous exercise” to support “untenable territorial” claims, asserting that the state has always been and will always remain an “inalienable” part of India.In their virtual diplomatic talks on November 18, India and China agreed to hold the 14th round of military talks at an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement in remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5, 2020, following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas.Both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process last year in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake and in the Gogra area.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-hold-14th-round-of-military-talks-to-resolve-eastern-ladakh-standoff-360618

A judicially trained independent mind assisted by officers well acquainted with security considerations, and the Registrar General of the High Court who had seized records on our orders, would inquire into the incident," it said.The committee will probe into the causes of the security breach, ascertain as to who were the persons responsible for it and recommend measures for preventing such lapses in VVIPs' security in future, it said.The Bench -- which also included Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli -- stayed the proceedings initiated by the inquiry committees set up by the Centre and the Punjab Government.The top court directed the Registrar General of the Punjab and Haryana High Court to submit all records and documents seized by him orders to probe panel head.The Bench -- which had on Monday said, "We are taking the PM's security breach very seriously" --requested the probe panel to submit its report at the earliest.The order came on a PIL filed by 'Lawyer's Voice' seeking a thorough investigation into the security lapse during Prime Minister's visit to Punjab.The security breach happened on January 5 when Modi was on his way to address a BJP rally and his cavalcade had to take a U-turn after some protesters blocked his way. The Prime Minister was reportedly stuck on a flyover for around 20 minutes.Punjab Advocate General DS Patwalia had on Monday demanded an independent probe into the breach in the Prime Minister's security, saying the state would not get a fair hearing in any probe carried out by the Centre.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the centre's committee had only issued show cause notices. It's an admitted case of security lapse and the PM was exposed, he had said.The Supreme Court had on Monday ordered setting up a high-level committee headed by a former judge of the top court to probe into the security lapse but the composition was not announced.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-ex-judge-justice-indu-malhotra-to-head-probe-to-investigate-pm-modis-security-lapse-in-punjab-360612
