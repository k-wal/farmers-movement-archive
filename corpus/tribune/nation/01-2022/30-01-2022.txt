30-01-2022||New Delhi||2 years on, vaccines, following protocols remain most effective weapons against Covid-19||As India completed two years since the outbreak of Covid-19, vaccines and following Covid Appropriate Behaviour remain the most effective weapons against the deadly virus.Though a number of drugs and other methods have been tried, no definitive treatment has emerged as yet.The country saw its first case of Covid-19 on January 30, 2020, when a third-year medical student from Wuhan University tested positive. She had returned home following semester holidays.Since then, India has witnessed three waves of Covid-19, though the line of treatment has remained the same throughout.Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Saturday said irrespective of the Covid-19 variants, ‘Test-Track-Treat-Vaccinate and Adherence to Covid Appropriate Behaviour’ continue to remain the tested strategy for Covid-19 management.Several medical treatments were also tried to tackle Covid-19 but no widely accepted treatment has been seen till now.Recently, at a press briefing, NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr V K Paul expressed concern over the “overuse and misuse” of drugs.“The use of steroids can increase the chances of Mucormycosis (black fungus). Steroids are very potent life-saving drugs but they also have side effects and they disturb the immunological protection. They disturb many biochemical pathways. So, it was a very big lesson...we were learning at that time but now we know it,” he had said.“For fever, paracetamol is given, and for cough, AYUSH syrup can be used. This is what we have prescribed in the home care module too. If the cough continues for more than three days, there is an inhaler called Budesonide. These are the only three things that need to be done. Other than that, gargle and take rest. Do not overdo, it has a cost,” he had warned.The country tried treatments such as plasma therapy, Remdesivir, DRDO’s anti-Covid drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) and most recently Molnupiravir, but there has been no definitive medicine to cure Covid-19 patients.As attempts to tackle Covid-19 and its most recent variant Omicron continue, vaccines remain the most viable option for mitigating the disease.Prime Minister Narendra Modi underlined the importance of vaccination and the need to further accelerate the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ programme to achieve 100 per cent vaccination coverage.AYUSH interventions and Yoga found a special place in the line of treatment.Dr Shuchin Bajaj, Founder Director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, said AYUSH has an important role in countering cold-related diseases and not just Covid-19.“Yoga has many good asanas for increasing your lung capacity and increasing your strength. And also, meditation has a big role in calming your mind because we have seen that fear, anxiety and depression are some of the key things that come along with Covid-19,” Bajaj said.The Department of Science and Technology (DST) had funded a clinical trial at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Rishikesh, to determine if the chanting of the Gayatri Mantra and performing the Yoga practice of Pranayama can aid the quality of recovery as well as cure Covid-19.Dr Rajeev Rajesh, Chief Yoga Officer, Jindal Naturecure Institute, said though the human body has a natural ability to preserve, self-regulate, repair and maintain its entity, it requires “something extra” to deal with the constant challenges.“That is where the ancient practice of yoga comes into play. To stay healthy and fit physically and mentally, you need to sustain your vital energy, nourish your body, boost immunity and support your mental health. That’s what yoga brings to you,” he told PTI.“From stretching the muscles to flexing the joints to improving blood flow, asanas shower us with a myriad of benefits that in turn, boost the immunity power of the body,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/2-years-on-vaccines-following-protocols-remain-most-effective-weapons-against-covid-19-365609

30-01-2022||---||Turkey emerging as new Dubai in anti-India operations: Report||New Delhi, January 30Turkey is the new Dubai as far as influence operations against Kashmir are concerned, concur security officials here who are now detecting attempts to expand its ambit to cover the Indian mainland Muslims as well as raise doubts about India’s foreign policy.Two intelligence reports late last year had flagged the emergence of Turkey as the hub of anti-India activities pushed by Pakistan’s ISI after its earlier stomping grounds of UAE and Saudi Arabia became out of bounds as these countries intensified ties with New Delhi to the extent of storing their strategic reserves in India.The expansion of Turkey’s foreign policy footprint tallies with Ankara’s attempt to influence Muslims beyond the Arab heartland. Despite a failed attempt to form a grouping with Pakistan and Malaysia, ties with ISI turned warmer and have gone beyond Kashmir to backing Islamist organisations in India that share their global perspective.The report to NSC Secretariat speaks of three-pronged efforts by the Turkish government and related institutions -- by media (employment to Kashmiri journalists); educational institutes (well paying scholarships) and NGOs (influence Indian Muslims on foreign policy inimical to Indian interests).The agencies are now detecting attempts to strengthen the Turkey-Azerbaijan-Pakistan alliance after its successful military performance against Armenia which India had backed by supplying Swathi radars worth $ 40 million. Some Muslim organisations here have been seeking sanctions against Armenia which India plans to further assist economically and militarily.Pakistan’s ISI is also interested in marginalising India from the region after it reportedly provided mercenaries to Azerbaijan in its fight against Armenia that has traditionally defended India’s position on Jammu and Kashmir.India, however, plans to be heavily involved in the region economically through the International North South Transport Corridor (INSTC) and it is currently in talks to include the Chabahar port in its ambit as well. The route bypasses Pakistan and could become more of an international corridor than the China Pakistan Economic Corridor because of the involvement of an increasing number of nations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/turkey-emerging-as-new-dubai-in-anti-india-operations-report-365596

PM Modi should continue to lead this country as he has taken bold decisions like (bringing) CAA, abrogating sections 370 and 35 A etc. I feel, possibly, Pak Occupied Kashmir (PoK) will come back to India by 2024,” he said while delivering a memorial lecture.Patil said that people can afford to buy mutton for Rs 700, pizza for Rs 500-600, “but buying onions for Rs 10 and tomatoes for Rs 40 is costly for us”.“Nobody will support rice in prices. But Narendra Modi has not become the prime minister to bring down the prices of onions and potatoes. If you understand the reason behind the rise in prices of these commodities you will not blame him (Modi),” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hope-pak-occupied-kashmir-will-become-part-of-india-by-2024-union-minister-kapil-patil-365583

30-01-2022||New Delhi||Delhi court denies bail to Bulli Bai App’s alleged creator Niraj Bishnoi||A Delhi court has dismissed the bail application of Niraj Bishnoi, the alleged creator of the Bulli Bai app, saying his offence was not only against the essence of womanhood but was also designed to disturb communal harmony.Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana denied the relief to the accused on January 29, noting that the allegations against him were serious in nature and the investigation was at a nascent stage.Several complaints were received by police stations in the country regarding the listing of Muslim women for “auction” on the ‘Bulli Bai’ mobile application with photographs sourced without permission and doctored. It has happened for the second time in less than a year.The app appeared to be a clone of ‘Sulli Deals’ which triggered a similar row last year.The judge passed the order after hearing arguments of the accused as well as the prosecution.“The sardonic conduct of the applicant accused in targeting women journalists of a particular community, using offensive monikers with derogatory communal overtones, on a social platform is not only an offence against the essence of womanhood but also an act designed to enrage passion and cause ill will amongst communities and disturb communal harmony,” the judge said in the order.The accused had sought bail on the ground that the investigation against him was already complete and no fruitful purpose would be served by keeping him behind bars.He had submitted that he is an engineering student and has no criminal antecedents.The prosecution had opposed the bail application arguing that in the present case, doctored photographs of the complainant, a journalist, were shared on Twitter handle @bullibai through a web app.It submitted that the accused created a web app Bullibai on Github website/portal platform by using Proton VPN to hide his identity.It further submitted that after the arrest of the accused, his laptop and mobile phone were analysed and various incriminating material have been recovered including many lewd comments and derogatory remarks on the doctored photographs of victims in Bullibai web app using Twitter handles @wannabesigmaf and @bullibai.The Delhi police had further submitted that the investigation was at a nascent stage and if the accused was released on bail, he may attempt to influence the fair course of the investigation.The probe agency had told the court that the accused used his Twitter handle to target women of a particular community.It told the court that the contents of Bishnoi’s Twitter handles were derogatory as he and others were using words like ‘Suli’ and ‘Buli’ for the women of a particular community.Bishnoi, a 21-year-old engineering student, is said to be the main conspirator and creator of the Bulli Bai app on GitHub and the main Twitter account holder of the app.He was arrested by Delhi Police’s Special Cell from Assam’s Jorhat on January 5, 2022.An engineering student from Bengaluru, a young girl from Uttarakhand and one of her friends have also been arrested by Mumbai Police in connection with the ‘Bulli Bai’ app case.The Delhi Police had registered a separate case based on the complaint of a journalist for offences under Sections 153A (promoting enmity on grounds of religion etc), 153B (imputations prejudicial to national integration), 354A (sexual harassment) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code.                                      #BulliBai                                     #DelhiHighCourt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-court-denies-bail-to-bulli-bai-apps-alleged-creator-niraj-bishnoi-365567

It is a matter of pride that till now about four-and-a-half crore children have been administered the first dose of coronavirus vaccine, he said."This means that about 60 per cent of youth in the age group of 15 to 18 years have got their vaccines within three to four weeks. This will not only protect our youth but will also help them to continue with their studies," he said.Another good thing is that within 20 days, one crore people have taken the precaution dose as well, Modi said. "This trust of our people on the indigenous vaccines is our great strength," the prime minister said.He asserted that India is fighting the new wave of coronavirus with "great success"."People should be safe, the pace of economic activities of the country should be maintained -- this is the wish of every person in the country," Modi said.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Modi congratulated fellow citizens for this "momentous feat" of full vaccination of 75 per cent of all adults and said he is proud of all those who are making the inoculation drive a success.Tagging a tweet by Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya in which he stated that India has achieved its goal of vaccinating 75 per cent adult population against Covid, the prime minister said, "75% of all adults are fully vaccinated.

30-01-2022||New Delhi||‘Remain friends’ despite no tie-up with NCP-Shiv Sena in Goa: P Chidambaram||Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Sunday said an alliance could not be forged between his party and the NCP-Shiv Sena for the Goa Assembly polls despite best efforts but asserted that they “will remain friends” and after the elections, the Congress would continue to explore opportunities to “work together” with them.Chidambaram, who is the Congress’ senior election observer for the Goa Assembly polls, also hit out at the TMC for its barbs at the Congress for not forging an alliance with it, saying the party continued to poach Congress leaders, despite making an offer of a tie-up.The senior Congress leader said he received no instructions from the party leadership to hold talks with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and added that, “I am sure our leadership had taken into account all the facts and circumstances”.In an interview with PTI, Chidambaram said whether the party would announce a chief ministerial name before or after the elections would be decided after consulting all the candidates and the party would go by the consensus among them.He also asserted that the contest in the Goa polls is “between the Congress (plus Goa Forward Party) and the BJP and we will be able to win a simple majority”.Asked why the Congress was not able to tie up with other Opposition parties especially the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Shiv Sena, Chidambaram said the NCP and Shiv Sena are the Congress’ allies in Maharashtra and it would have liked them to be allies in Goa as well. “We tried.They made certain proposals.We made certain proposals. Unfortunately, there was no meeting point. I acknowledge that both sides had compulsions and despite our best efforts we could not find a meeting point,” Chidambaram said.“Nevertheless, we are friends and will remain friends. After the elections, we will continue to explore opportunities to work together with NCP and Shiv Sena,” he said.After the 2019 Assembly elections in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena, which till then allied with the BJP, joined hands with the NCP and the Congress, to form a government, which was given the name Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA). The Shiv Sena and the NCP had earlier this month announced that they would contest the Goa elections together.Asked about the TMC’s barbs at the Congress over not forging a tie-up with it, Chidambaram said he is not able to understand the TMC’s position.“They entered Goa a few months ago and my distinguished friend, Mamata ji, declared in Goa that TMC had formed an alliance and any other party was welcome to join their alliance. The General Secretary of TMC declared that TMC will contest all 40 seats. Then, they lured Mr Luizinho Faleiro, Congress MLA, to the TMC,” Chidambaram said.The Congress announced its first list of candidates on December 16, including the name of Reginald Laurenco, sitting MLA, and four days later, on December 20, Laurenco was admitted to the TMC, he said, detailing the sequence of events.“On December 24, TMC’s Vice President met me and suggested that the two parties should work together in Goa. I agreed to convey the suggestion to our leadership, and I promptly did,” he said.However, the TMC continued to poach our leaders, sarpanches, panches, etc., for example in Vasco and Marmugao, he said.“I received no instructions from our leadership to hold talks with TMC. I am sure our leadership had taken into account all the facts and circumstances. As far as I was concerned, the matter rested there,” Chidambaram said.On the Congress MLAs switching to BJP in the current assembly and what measures the party was taking to prevent a repeat, the Congress’ Goa polls in-charge said “loyalty” is the “top priority” for the party.The most important measure — which has been implemented in 30 constituencies — is that candidates recommended by the Block have been selected to contest the elections, he said.“Blocks were asked to place loyalty as the top criterion. Next, the candidates spontaneously offered to take a pledge before a Temple, a Church and a Dargah. I think such a pledge has removed any lingering doubt about the loyalty of our candidates to the Congress Party and to the voters who will vote them to office,” Chidambaram said.Ahead of the elections, the candidates of the Congress, which was hit hardest by defections in the BJP-ruled state in the last five years, have taken an ‘anti-defection pledge’ before a temple, church as well as a dargah.Asked if the party would announce a CM face before polls, Chidambaram pointed out that he has stated that whether “we should announce a CM name before or after the elections will be decided after consulting all the candidates”.“We intend to do that. We will go by the consensus among the candidates,” he said.On whether the Congress would be open to a post poll alliance, Chidambaram said the contest was between the Congress (+GFP) and the BJP and exuded confidence that his party’s alliance will be able to win a simple majority.He said that post elections, if other parties are willing to support a Congress-led government, the Congress would take a call depending on the circumstances.Chidambaram said the feedback from the ground is “positive” and expressed confidence that the Congress’ alliance would do well as the “anti-BJP sentiment” is gathering pace everyday.After suffering BJP’s “misrule” for 10 years, the people of Goa want a non-BJP government, he said.Assembly polls for all 40 seats in Goa will be held on February 14.In the 2017 Goa Assembly elections, the Congress had won 17 seats in the House and emerged as the single largest party. But, the BJP, which had bagged 13 seats, quickly tied-up with some regional parties and independents to form the government in the state.                                      #Goapolls                                     #PChidambaram||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/remain-friends-despite-no-tie-up-with-ncp-shiv-sena-in-goa-p-chidambaram-365563
30-01-2022||Vibha SharmaNew Delhi||UP: Akhilesh to file nomination papers from Karhal on Monday||Samajwadi Party chief will file his nomination papers from the Karhal Assembly seat in Mainpuri on Monday, according to party leaders.This will be the first time the former chief minister will contest the Assembly elections. An MP from Azamgarh, Yadav has never fought a state election before.Chief Minister Adityanath fighting from Gorakhpur Urban seat is being seen as one of the reasons behind Yadav's decision. BJP leaders like Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya had been taking jibes at him saying that he was afraid to contest the assembly electionsSources, however, say the decision is also guided by another factor.While Yadav has patched up with his estranged uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav and his Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia) and announced an alliance between the two parties last December, observers say he "needs to be there in Assembly to keep a control on SP MLAs either way, if things work out or don't as per SP's plan".Meanwhile, Samajwadi leaders said the people of Karhal in Mainpuri want Yadav to contest the election from there. "It will be a one-way election in Karhal and Akhilesh Yadav will win the election with a huge margin," they claimed.While Karhal is a traditional strong hold, the Samajwadi Party had suffered a setback in 2002 pollsThe BJP is yet to announce its candidate from Karhal.                                     #UPElections2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-akhilesh-to-file-nomination-papers-from-karhal-on-monday-365561

30-01-2022||Ahmedabad||Make in India, Atmanirbhar Bharat new definitions of Mahatma Gandhi's Swadeshi movement: Amit Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday said the Centre's schemes like Make in India, Atmanirbhar Bharat and Vocal for Local are the new definitions of "Swadeshi", the movement promoted by Mahatma Gandhi.The ideas propagated by Mahatma Gandhi to rebuild India after achieving freedom were forgotten for several years before they were given a new lease of life by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said. Shah was in Ahmedabad to unveil a wall mural of Mahatma Gandhi on the occasion of his death anniversary, which is also observed as the Martyrs' Day.  The mural, installed by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC), adorns a wall on the Sabarmati riverfront. It is made on a 100 square metre aluminium plate using 2,975 clay pots made by 75 potters brought from different parts of the country and trained here. "Mahatma Gandhi not just fought for India's freedom, but also offered many ways to rebuild the country after it had achieved freedom, through swadeshi, satyagrah, swabhasha, sadhan shuddhi, aparigraha (non-possessiveness), prayer, fast and simplicity," Shah said in his address.  He said Mahatma Gandhi instilled these ideas in the consciousness of the citizens while fighting against the British, so as to make them the base for the country's reconstruction after it achieved freedom. "Unfortunately, while homage was paid to the photos of Bapu, and he found mention in speeches for many years, Khadi, handicrafts, use of swabhasha and swadeshi were forgotten. After becoming the prime minister, Narendra Modi gave a new lease of life to all these ideas of Bapu," Shah said. The Centre's schemes such as "Make in India, Atmanirbhar Bharat and Vocal for Local are the new definitions of Swadeshi," the Union minister said. "The concept of the economic upliftment of India, to make it the world manufacturing hub through atmanirbharta (self-reliance), and an appeal to 130 crore Indians to use indigenous products -- these three ideas have emerged from Bapu's   Swadeshi (movement)," he said. Shah said Modi's efforts to renew the use of Khadi have helped the KVIC achieve a turnover of Rs 95,000 crore. He also appealed to the people of Gujarat to use Khadi clothes. "Khadi is not just the way to empower the poor, but is an example of India's self-esteem," he said, adding that the ideas behind the use of Khadi as propounded by Mahatma Gandhi remain relevant even today.  Shah said the new education policy lays emphasis on "swabhasha". The new education policy it will give due importance to the Indian languages, because if India is detached from its languages, it will get separated from its culture, history, literature and grammar, Shah said. On the occasion, Union MSME Minister Narayan Rane said the mural was a unique homage to Mahatma Gandhi by the KVIC, which comes under his ministry.  "Mahatma Gandhi's ideas about Khadi, employment generation and for India to become independent are driving the country today," Rane said.  Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel said the mural was the perfect tribute to Mahatma Gandhi in the 75th year of India's Independence.  "Along with enhancing the beauty of the Sabarmati riverfront, the mural will continue to give the message of rashtranirman (nation-building)," the CM said. The KVIC in a statement said it has installed the mural "to commemorate the 74th Martyrs' Day of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, in the 75th year of Independence."   On the occasion, electric pottery wheels and bee boxes were given to 600 beneficiaries under the KVIC schemes.                                     #AmitShah                                     #MahatmaGandhi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/make-in-india-atmanirbhar-bharat-new-definitions-of-mahatma-gandhis-swadeshi-movement-amit-shah-365556
30-01-2022||New Delhi||Fresh plea in SC on Pegasus row seeks probe into 2017 India-Israel defence deal||A fresh plea has been filed in the Supreme Court on the alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus, asking the court to take cognisance of a New York Times report on it and order a probe into the 2017 defence deal with Israel.   The media report claiming India bought Pegasus spyware as part of a USD 2 billion defence deal with Israel in 2017 has triggered a major controversy with the Opposition alleging that the government indulged in illegal snooping that amounted to “treason”.The plea filed by advocate ML Sharma, who is one of the original petitioners in the case before the top court, said the deal was not approved by Parliament and, therefore, needs to be cancelled and money be recovered.  He urged the top court to issue suitable directions for registering a criminal case and to investigate the impugned Pegasus spyware purchase deal and alleged misuse of public funds in the interest of justice. The media report has said Pegasus and a missile system were the “centrepieces” of a roughly USD 2 billion deal of sophisticated weapons and intelligence gear between India and Israel in 2017.The NYT, in its report titled ‘The Battle for the World’s Most Powerful Cyberweapon’, said the Israeli firm NSO Group had for nearly a decade been “selling its surveillance software on a subscription basis to law-enforcement and intelligence agencies around the world, promising that it could do what no one else—not a private company, not even a state intelligence service—could do: consistently and reliably crack the encrypted communications of any iPhone or Android smartphone”. On October 27, last year, the top court had appointed a 3-member panel of cyber experts to probe the alleged use of Pegasus for surveillance of certain people in India, saying the state cannot get a “free pass” every time the spectre of national security is raised and it cannot be the “bugbear” that the judiciary shies away from.In one of the significant verdicts in recent times over the issue of citizens’ right to privacy, a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana had said that mere invocation of national security by the state cannot render the judiciary a “mute spectator” and asserted that indiscriminate spying on individuals in a democratic country cannot be allowed. The apex court said Justice Raveendran will oversee the functioning of the three-member panel of cyber security, digital forensics, networks and hardware.It had said that former IPS officer Alok Joshi and Sundeep Oberoi—Chairman, Sub Committee in (International Organisation of Standardisation/ International Electro-Technical Commission/Joint Technical Committee)---will assist Justice Raveendran to oversee the task to the committee.The apex court had said it is appointing the committee in view of the six compelling circumstances: Right to privacy and freedom of speech are alleged to be impacted, which needs to be examined; entire citizenry is affected by such allegations due to the potential chilling effect, no clear stand taken by the Centre regarding actions taken by it and seriousness accorded to the allegations by foreign countries and involvement of foreign parties.                                      #Pegasus||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fresh-plea-in-sc-on-pegasus-row-seeks-probe-into-2017-india-israel-defence-deal-365554

PNB Housing opened 13 Unnati locations during the quarter ended December 2021.The company initiated a transformational ‘Project IGNITE’ last fiscal year, aimed at boosting the affordable housing business, enhancing its core capabilities by catering to the self-employed segment as well as creating differentiators to beat the competition in the salaried segment loan market, among others.The company is focussing on high-yielding affordable housing business Unnati in tier-II and -III geographies, its Managing Director and CEO Hardayal Prasad said during an earnings call after Q3FY22 results.“We have already opened 13 Unnati locations during the quarter and 25 new locations will be operationalised by March 2022...to increase our presence and enhance business in this segment,” Prasad said.Total assets under management (AUM) of Unnati stands at Rs 3,089 crore as of December 31, 2021.“Unnati has remained the focus for us and it will continue to grow. As of now, we are able to do nine per cent of the total actual business.“We have also identified 50 branches across the geographies where we are present... It will help us increase our reach and source our Unnati business in Q4 of the financial year 2022,” its Business Head (Retail) Pankaj Jain said.Jain added that monthly disbursement numbers are expected to cross Rs 100 crore on an immediate basis. “Our overall percentage of Unnati share will grow from nine per cent to maybe 12-14 per cent. That’s what we are looking at.” In a question related to fundraising after the company aborted the Rs 4,000-crore equity deal led by Carlyle, Prasad said: “We are still working on it. We have not announced anything. We have not come out with anything. We are still working on the capital raise. And hopefully, once we have taken some calls, we will come back to you and we will make the necessary announcement.”  PNB Housing Finance posted a net profit of Rs 188 crore in the quarter ended December 2021, down by 19 per cent from the previous close. Disbursement, however, grew 19 per cent to Rs 7,548 crore.Its Credit Head (Retail) Jatul Anand said, “For Unnati loans, we have categorised the loans under the Rs 35 lakh segment for both salaried and self-employed.”                                      #AffordableHousing                                     #PNBHousing                                     #UnnatiScheme||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/pnb-housing-finance-focuses-on-affordable-housing-segment-to-operationalize-25-new-branches-by-march-365550
30-01-2022||Lucknow||Drive to confiscate properties of Nawabs to be launched soon, says SP leader||Samajwadi Party leader Abdullah Azam on Sunday said the properties given to the Nawabs for “being loyal to the British” should be confiscated and that a movement in this connection will be launched from Rampur.Abdullah, who was recently released on bail after losing his MLA berth in a fake birth certificate case, claimed innocence and said it was the handiwork of vested interests to tarnish his family’s image.“The members of the Nawab family (Nawabs of Rampur) were loyal to the British, which is why they were given awards and titles. Such people have no place in India. Properties given to the Nawabs for betraying the country should be confiscated. A movement will be launched in Rampur to convert these properties into government properties,” Abdullah, son of senior SP leader and Rampur MP Azam Khan, told PTI.The descendant of the erstwhile royal family, Kazim Ali Khan (alias Naved Miyan) is fighting Abdullah Azam Khan for the Rampur seat on a Congress ticket.The two political families have been arch-rivals since 1980s.When asked about BJP ally Apna Dal Sonelal fielding Haider Ali Khan of the Nawab family as his rival for the Suar seat, Abdullah said, “Who is Haider Ali Khan... I don’t recognise him.” On the BJP labelling the SP as pro-Pakistan, ‘Jinnahwadi’ (follower of Mohammad Ali Jinnah) and ‘Tamanchawadi’ (fond of using country-made pistols), Abdullah said the BJP should first answer when it would provide justice to the families of farmers killed in Lakhimpur Kheri.Speaking about his days in jail, Abdullah said it was a “bad dream” and it taught him a lot. He alleged that he and his family were deliberately targeted and attempts were made to tarnish their image.“It was a very bad dream. I wasn’t as very disturbed by the troubles and ruminations in jail as I was during the five months of being infected with Covid-19. Not just the two years spent in jail but the last five years have taught me a lot.”On campaigning in the absence of his father, who is still in jail, Abdullah said, “My father may have been in jail for a long time, but the campaign started by him will ensure give his victory in the elections… The campaign that Azam Khan started in Rampur 40 years ago is still alive.” On allegations of using a fake birth certificate at the time of his nomination as the SP candidate from Suar constituency in the 2017 Assembly elections, Abdullah said, “Neither my birth certificate nor my PAN card or passport is fake. But I am apprehensive that the BJP may get my nomination cancelled.” Abdullah, his father Azam Khan and mother Tazeen Fatima surrendered in February 2020 in connection with this case and few others, and were sent to Sitapur Jail.Abdullah had been elected from Suar constituency seat in the 2017 polls but was disqualified in 2019 in the fake birth certificate case.His father Azam Khan has more than 100 cases registered against him and is in jail for the last 23 months.Tazeen, who was released on bail in December 2020, is currently the MLA from Rampur City. —                                     #UttarPradeshElections2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drive-to-confiscate-properties-of-nawabs-to-be-launched-soon-says-sp-leader-by-muhammad-mazhar-saleem-365549
30-01-2022||New Delhi||People should work together to rid nation of corruption: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said corruption is like a “termite” which makes the country hollow and all the people of the country have to work together to rid the nation of it as soon as possible.In his Mann Ki Baat radio broadcast, Modi said more than one crore children have sent him “their Mann Ki Baat” via postcards which have come from many parts of the country and even from abroad.These postcards give a glimpse of the broad and comprehensive outlook of the new generation for our country’s future, Modi said.Talking about a postcard from a girl in Uttar Pradesh who had said she wants to see an India free of corruption by 2047, Modi said, “You have talked about corruption-free india. Corruption is like a termite which makes the country hollow. Why wait for 2047 to get rid of it? This is a work all the people of the country, today’s youth, have to do together, it has to be done as soon as possible.” “And, therefore, it becomes very important that we give priority to our duties. Where there is a sense of duty, where the duty is supreme, corruption cannot exist,” he said.In his radio broadcast, the prime minister also talked about the merging of the ‘Amar Jawan Jyoti’ near India Gate and the flame at the nearby National War Memorial.“We have seen that ‘Amar Jawan Jyoti’ near India Gate and the flame at the nearby National War Memorial have been merged into one. On this emotional moment, many countrymen and the family of martyrs had tears in their eyes,” Modi said.He urged people to visit the War Memorial.                                       #IndiaAgainstCorruption                                     #MannkiBaat                                     #NarendraModi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/people-should-work-together-to-rid-nation-of-corruption-pm-365548
30-01-2022||Lucknow||BJP has fielded 99 criminals, says Akhilesh||Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav has alleged that the BJP has, so far, fielded 99 candidates with a criminal history.“The BJP is short of hitting a century. They have given tickets to 99 criminals,” he said in a tweet on Sunday.बाबा जी की ब्रेकिंग न्यूज़: भाजपा के आपराधिक छवि के प्रत्याशियों का शतक पूरा होने में बस एक की कमी… अब तक आपराधिक छवि के 99 उम्मीदवारों को टिकट दे चुकी है!  The war of words between the SP and BJP has been rapidly escalating on the issue of criminals.While the BJP has been accusing Akhilesh Yadav and his party of patronising persons with criminal backgrounds, Akhilesh has returned the fire by demanding to know the number of cases against Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy Chief Minister Keshav Maurya.Union Home Minister Amit Shah has said during his tours in the state that if the SP comes to power, there will be a reign of criminals in the state.Yogi Adityanath, meanwhile has said that when he returns to power after the Assembly elections, he would continue with his bulldozer policies against criminals.IANS                                     #AkhileshYadav                                     #UPPolls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-has-fielded-99-criminals-says-akhilesh-365546
30-01-2022||Lucknow||UP polls: SP's red caps painted in blood of 'karsevaks', says Adityanath||The Samajwadi Party’s red caps are painted in the blood of victims of Muzaffarnagar riots and ‘karsewaks’ shot dead in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said.Attacking the SP in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Adityanath, have been repeatedly targeting the party’s red cap.“The red cap of the Samajwadi Party is painted in the blood of victims of Muzaffarnagar riots and karsewaks who were shot in Ayodhya,” Adityanath said while speaking at an event organised by a channel on Saturday evening.Addressing a rally in Gorakhpur in December last year, Modi had targeted the SP, saying those in red caps were a “red alert” and “sign of danger” for the state, while Adityanath had in February last year, said every child sees those wearing red caps as “goons”.The chief minister said his government has been working to protect the masses and instill a sense of safety among them while ensuring that “criminals feel scared” and surrender before police with folded hands.Accusing the previous SP government of neglecting the poor people of the state, the chief minister alleged that the Akhilesh Yadav-led government worked only for a few friends involved in perfume business.“They can deny (allegations) but can’t change what is true,” he said.“They (SP) never considered Uttar Pradesh and its people as their own. Their views are family-centric and Pakistan-centric. Before 2017, riots used to occur every third day in the state and girls use to fear for their safety. This has changed under the BJP rule,” Adityanath said.Claiming that his government has provided a new identity to Uttar Pradesh, he said, “Now businessmen and people are not forced to migrate from the state. Businessmen are now returning to the state and contributing to its development.” Reacting to accusations that the BJP government has targeted the people of a particular religion and why over 80 cases were lodged against SP leader Azam Khan, Adityanath said, “Our government has not lodged any politically motivated FIR against anyone.” “The cases against Azam Khan are a result of his wrongdoings. If anyone tries to encroach land belonging to the poor and build an institution there, then action will be taken against that person,” he said “Our government has provided benefits to people from every caste and background. In SP, BSP and Congress governments, the leaders use to build their house first. This has changed in our government. We have worked to provide a house to every family in the state,” he said.On sugarcane farmers in western Uttar Pradesh, the CM said, “The Samajwadi Party sold several sugar mills at throwaway prices. Our government has not only ensured smooth functioning of sugar mills but have also established new ones. The SP lacks vision for the development of the state.” He said the “double engine” government has taken the state to new heights of development in the last five years.The term “double engine” is used by BJP leaders to refer to the party being in power at the Centre as well as in a state.“The work done by us has given recognition to the state not only in the country but across the world,” he added.                                      #AkhileshYadav                                     #RedCap                                     #SP                                     #YogiAdityanath||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-polls-sps-red-caps-painted-in-blood-of-karsevaks-says-adityanath-365543
30-01-2022||New Delhi||Incentives for green hydrogen likely in Union Budget||The government may provide for targeted fiscal incentives and allocation of funds for promotion of green hydrogen in the country in Union Budget 2022-23, which is slated to be unveiled in Parliament on Tuesday.The government launched National Hydrogen Mission in 2021. Earlier this month, Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh had indicated that a green hydrogen policy will be unveiled in February which would feature many incentives to boost green hydrogen in the country.“While 2021 saw the launch of National Hydrogen Mission, it is likely that the Budget may provide for targeted fiscal incentives for R&D in green hydrogen segment, creation of domestic supply chain for hydrogen and reduce customs duties on electrolysers to boost green hydrogen production,” says Venkatesh Raman Prasad, Partner, J Sagar Associates (JSA).Prasad is of the view that India’s commitment at COP 26 of achieving net zero emissions by 2070 and meet 50 per cent of energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030 shows that the government intends to focus on cleaner sources of energy.Hemant Mallya, Senior Programme Lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) opines that green hydrogen has many industrial uses and can potentially decarbonise many hard-to-abate sectors, like the iron and steel industry.He says that an outlay of Rs 1,200 crore by 2024 in the upcoming Budget could trigger pilots in various end-use applications such as testing green hydrogen readiness of natural gas pipelines, underground hydrogen storage, and pilots for equipment such as furnaces, boilers, and process heaters.He suggests that another Rs 165 crore could support R&D, especially on catalysts and electrolyser membranes, finding substitutes for critical minerals, setting up testing labs and enforcing safety standards.These investments would help indigenize green hydrogen production and use as an industrial fuel, he opines.Davinder Sandhu, Co-founder & Chairman, Primus Partners says that electrolysers used to manufacture hydrogen at present are expensive and bringing down their cost will contribute to reducing the cost of green hydrogen.This will enable the country to meet the target of establishing 10 gigawatt of domestic manufacturing capacity as well as making India a global leader in the sector, he opines.In this regard, he suggests that the government should consider a production linked incentive (PLI) scheme which can support indigenization of electrolysers and scaling up of green hydrogen production at optimized cost.Earlier this month, Union minister R K Singh had said a new green hydrogen policy will feature incentives like free power transmission for 25 years, dollar denominated bids, offer of land in renewable energy parks and land allocation near ports for creating bunkers for green hydrogen or ammonia.                                      #GreenHydrogen                                     #NHM                                     #UnionBudget||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/incentives-for-green-hydrogen-likely-in-union-budget-365540

Rajasthan hoteliers are now trying out innovations to overcome the pandemic blues. These innovations are running high in boutique properties located in Rajasthan's tourist cities like Udaipur and Jodhpur where new packages and newer experiences are being created for new age travellers, who have turned health conscious. They want healthy food cooked in traditional ways while staying in off-beat locations."This is the segment which we are receiving ever since the pandemic hit us hard. This group of travellers comes from the IT sector. Work-from-home gave them the freedom to work from any part of India and hence we have been getting small families and groups from Mumbai, Bengaluru, Gurugram and Delhi," said Ravindra Nath Purohit, General Manager, Ramya Resort & Spa, Udaipur, which claims to be India's youngest high-end luxury resort.Showcasing a contemporary Thai-Balinese decor, the property is now focusing on domestic travellers and is all set to hire local people trained in home cooked food on the tandoor and chulha so that guests can be introduced to the old world charm of cooking.Via these initiatives, we shall hire more local people and create jobs during the pandemic, Purohit said, adding, "The new age traveller is workaholic but also wants to take a break from the hectic city life. He along with his family wants to experience the delights of organic food, while being introduced to the traditional ways of cooking. Hence we are making newer packages for this segment and are working on converting the open land into organic fields where guests can pluck vegetables, fruits of their choice which shall be served to them after being cooked on the local 'chulha' and tandoor." Another hotelier Varun Jalan from Daspan House Jodhpur said, "Our property was launched in December 2019 and soon after came the pandemic. Hence we could not get much time to think afresh. Meanwhile, the lockdown gave us a chance to innovate. As we were getting the IT crowd from Mumbai and Gujarat, we planned to bring in spice street tours along with street tours to the local bangle market, chat market and other such streets so that the kids of the next generation can get an insight into the small city charm." "We have tied up with small companies who are taking our guests on tours to organic farms etc. Also, we shall take travellers to nearby villages where they can see how the local Bishnoi community cares for animals like deer and black bucks."  Both the hoteliers accepted that the pandemic has proved the adage 'Small is Beautiful' and hence they have been hosting small groups and a small number of wedding guests during the last two years. The connectivity to the two cities from the major metropolitan cities has helped them to get more guests."Earlier, the wedding chunk went to big hotels, however, now the guests are visiting us and enjoying the charm of staying together," he added.The tourist state witnessed a dip of 72.19 per cent in foreign arrivals and 71.05 per cent in domestic tourists in 2020 due to the pandemic.                                      #RajasthanHotels||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-effect-rajasthan-hotels-turn-land-into-farms-plan-spice-and-street-tours-to-woo-travelers-365532

India is a robust and vibrant democracy. It does not require certification from others. The claim that others need to protect our Constitution is presumptuous and preposterous. Arindam Bagchi, MEA Spokesperson“We have seen reports on this event. India is a robust and vibrant democracy. It does not require certification from others. The claim that others need to protect our Constitution is presumptuous and preposterous,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi, when asked by a Russian news agency about the event.Among nearly 10 speakers, Ansari had said, “In recent years, we have experienced the emergence of trends that dispute the well-established principle of civic nationalism and interposes a new and imaginary practice of cultural nationalism…. It wants to distinguish citizens on the basis of their faith, give vent to intolerance, insinuate otherness, and promote disquiet and insecurity.”Other speakers were more trenchant in their criticism. Nadine Maenza, Chair of USCIRF, wanted India to be put in the State Department’s Red List of human rights offenders and Kerry Kennedy, niece of former US President John Kennedy, alleged that New Delhi targeted all those who tried to hold governments accountable for human rights abuses.Carolyn Nash of Amnesty International said the stories of suffering human rights defenders “must be a wakeup call to show solidarity for civil society and human rights defenders at the front lines of India today”.Meanwhile, the Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) said the event was meant to promote a strong US-India strategic partnership “anchored in an understanding that their geopolitical interests are best served by advancing democracy, human rights and religious freedom”. The IAMC contested Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi’s allegation that it was linked with Pakistan’s ISI and the banned SIMI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mea-rebuffs-ansaris-remark-says-india-needs-no-certificate-365359

If they lose elections, they will naturally part ways. Even if they win by mistake, Azam Khan and Ateeq Ahmed will occupy the space next to Akhilesh and Jayant bhai will be out. The people of western UP have sensed the nature of things to come by merely looking at the SP-RLD candidate list,” he said.The BJP has been accusing the SP-RLD combine of fielding Muslims candidates with criminal record. The saffron narrative is to hammer the issue of law and order in UP.Shah challenged Akhilesh to debate UP’s crime statistics during the 2012-17 and the present Yogi Adityanath-led dispensation.“Incidents of dacoity have fallen by 70 per cent, loot by 69 per cent, murder and rape by 30 per cent and kidnapping by 35 per cent,” he said, stressing BJP’s “improved law and order” campaign plank vis-à-vis “SP’s proximity to history-sheeters.”The BJP is facing an uphill task in wooing Jats, the predominant farming community of western UP, which is upset over deaths during the farm agitation against agricultural laws and has begun retracing its loyalties to the RLD, a primarily Jat-based party. Electorally substantive Muslims too are rallying behind the SP-RLD queering the pitch for the BJP which is seeking to reignite the memories of 2013 riots which had polarised Jats and Muslims to saffron advantage in this region.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sp-rld-alliance-wont-last-beyond-counting-day-shah-365362

They are known as Supari Media. — VK Singh, MOSUtter rubbishThe insinuation about India’s UN vote (on Palestine) is utter rubbish. — Syed Akbaruddin, india’s ex-envoy to UNWatergate?Modi government must rebut... This implies prima facie that our government misled the Supreme Court and Parliament. Watergate? Subramanian SwamyCongress cites those targetedPegasus was used to potentially target Rahul Gandhi; ex-PM HD Deve Gowda; ex-CMs Siddaramaiah and HD Kumaraswamy; ex BJP CM Vasundhara Raje; BJP minister Prahlad Singh Patel; IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw; minister Smriti Irani’s OSD; MP Abhishek Banerjee; former VHP head Praveen Togadia; some SC judges; an Election Commissioner, ex-CBI Director Alok Verma; BSF ex-chief KK Sharma; former RAW officer Jitendra Ojha and two Army Colonels, among others.Citing a New York Times investigation, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi accused the government of buying Pegasus to spy on India’s primary democratic institutions, politicians and the public. “Government functionaries, Opposition leaders, armed forces, judiciary were all targeted by phone-tappings. This is treason. Modi government has committed treason,” he said.The Left parties too demanded the government’s response, saying silence would mean complicity.The government dismissed the report with former Army chief and Minister of State VK Singh calling NYT “supari media” and tweeting, “Can you trust NYT? They are known as Supari Media.”Even as the MoS sought to make light of the allegations, BJP’s Subramanian Swamy asked the Centre to rebut NYT, saying the purchase of spyware Pegasus by India would amount to a scandal akin to “Watergate.”“Modi government must rebut the New York Times revelations that it did, indeed, subscribe by payment from taxpayers’ money of Rs 300 crore to spyware Pegasus sold by Israeli NSO company. This implies prima facie that our government misled the Supreme Court and Parliament. Watergate?” Swamy tweeted, as the issue resurfaced ahead of the Budget session in repeat of 2021 when Pegasus-related reports surfaced ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament.IT Minister Ashwani Vaishnaw had then told the House that the timing of the reports was not a coincidence. “When we look at this issue through the prism of logic, it clearly emerges that there is no substance behind this sensationalism,” he had said while Home Minister Amit Shah had proclaimed in the Lok Sabha, “Aap chronology samajhiye! This is a report by disruptors for obstructors. Disruptors are global organisations which do not like India to progress. Obstructors are political players in India who do not want India to progress.”As the matter returned to haunt the NDA government again, the Congress urged the Supreme Court for suo motu note of the NYT report and penal proceedings against the government “for attempting to deliberately deceive” the apex court.“It is now very clear that Parliament was deceived, the Supreme Court duped and the people lied to,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.He said the Congress would talk to like-minded parties and “hold the PM accountable” in Parliament and in people’s court with elections underway in five states (UP, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa, Manipur).“This is treason, hijack of democracy, a systematic attack on the fundamental rights of privacy and dismantling of national security, considering who all were spied on illegally and unconstitutionally by this government,” Surjewala alleged. Congress veteran Mallikarjun Kharge said the government should sue the NYT, if they were lying. “If the government has the courage, it should file a defamation suit against NYT which has published the report stating that the government had purchased the spyware,” he said, recalling how the monsoon session last year was disrupted over the government’s denial of a debate on alleged government deployment of the weapons-grade cyber tool against its people.                                     #Pegasus||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-set-to-rock-parl-again-over-fresh-claims-365342

The state can’t get a free pass every time the spectre of national security was raised, the top court had said. Asking the panel to expeditiously probe the issue and submit a report, the Bench had ordered that the matter be listed for hearing after eight weeks. However, the case has not come up for hearing so far. Later, it had restrained the Justice MB Lokur Commission appointed by the West Bengal Government from going ahead with its proceedings.Not much is known about progress in the investigation, except that the technical committee had earlier this month invited information from people who suspected their phones were targeted.An international media consortium had reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using the spyware. It was also reported phones of a former judge of the Supreme Court and its registrars were allegedly intercepted using the spyware.Around 10 petitioners, including the Editors Guild of India and senior journalists N Ram and others, had moved the top court seeking an independent probe into the alleged snooping on eminent citizens, politicians and scribes by using Israeli firm NSO’s spyware.                                     #Pegasus||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/13-weeks-on-outcome-of-sc-probe-order-awaited-365343

The Health Ministry had said on Thursday early indications of Covid cases plateauing had been reported in certain geographies in the country but the trend needs to be observed.Responding to a question that cases have started plateauing in India, Dr Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, said the risk of Covid-19 remained high and no country, irrespective of their current transmission scenario, is “out of the woods” yet.“Hence, even though some cities or states may be beginning to see plateauing of cases, the risk persists. We need to continue to remain vigilant. Our focus must be on reducing transmission. Implementing situation-specific public health and social measures and increasing vaccine coverage - that’s the way forward for all countries in the ongoing pandemic,” said Singh.

A decline in Covid cases and positivity rate has been especially observed in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Odisha, Haryana and West Bengal.Asked if the pandemic is entering in endemic stages, Singh said, currently "we are still in the midst of the pandemic and the focus should be to curtail the virus spread and save lives"."By becoming endemic doesn't mean that the virus will not be a cause of concern," she said.Compared to the Covid's delta variant, she said omicron is able to more rapidly infect the tissues of the upper respiratory tract rather than the lungs, which may also help the spread of this variant."There appears to be a lower risk of severe disease and death following omicron infection as compared to other variants. However, due to the very high numbers of cases, many countries have seen a significant increase in the incidence of hospitalisation, putting pressure on health care systems," she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/risk-persists-even-though-covid-cases-starting-to-plateau-in-parts-of-india-who-365254
30-01-2022||New Delhi||Treason, democracy hijacked, says Congress on Pegasus expose||The Congress on Saturday launched an all-out attack on the government, accusing it of deceiving Parliament, duping the Supreme Court, hijacking democracy, and indulging in treason, after a media report claimed India bought the Pegasus spyware from Israel as part of a defence deal in 2017.The Congress said it intends to raise the issue in the budget session starting next week, and demand accountability from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government on the floor of Parliament.The principal opposition party also urged the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance of the matter and initiate appropriate penal proceedings against the government for attempting to “deliberately and knowingly deceive” it.With the Congress making its intention clear, the shadow of the Pegasus issue looms large again over the 2022 budget session as the entire Monsoon session of 2021 was washed out after the Opposition had jointly stalled the proceedings over the issue.According to a report in The New York Times, the Israeli spyware Pegasus and a missile system were the “centerpieces” of a roughly USD 2-billion deal of sophisticated weapons and intelligence gear between India and Israel in 2017.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi accused the government of treason by allegedly “tapping” phones of opposition leaders, armed forces and the judiciary using the Pagasus spyware.“The Modi Government bought Pegasus to spy on our primary democratic institutions, politicians and public. Government functionaries, opposition leaders, armed forces, judiciary all were targeted by these phone tappings. This is treason,” Gandhi said on Twitter.“The Modi Government has committed treason,” he alleged.Addressing a press conference here on the matter, Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged the Modi government “deceived” Parliament as well as “duped” the Supreme Court.He said the BJP machinery engaged in a massive strategy to also “dupe” the people of the country as it is now clear that the government led by Prime Minister Modi “purchased the illegal and unconstitutional” spyware from Israel and used it against opposition leaders, the judiciary, the media, and even its own functionaries.He alleged the government used public money to illegally purchase the cyber tool and spy upon its own people, and thus “hijacked” democracy. They committed an act of treason ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he alleged.“It is now very clear that Parliament was deceived by the Modi government, the Supreme Court was also duped and the people of India were lied to by the Modi government and its ministers,”  Surjewala said, adding these things being clear now, the role of the prime minister and his responsibility is now directly in question.“We will seek accountability from the prime minister on the floor of the Parliament, along with that of the government in the people’s court,” he said.“We will urge upon the Supreme Court to suo motu now take note and issue appropriate penal proceedings against this government for attempting to deliberately and knowingly deceive the Supreme Court,” Surjewala said.“It is treason, it is hijack of democracy and it is a systematic deception and attack on the fundamental rights of privacy and dismantling of national security considering who all were spied upon illegally and unconstitutionally by this government,” he alleged.Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, who joined him at the press conference, said when the government was “not ready to discuss the issue of Pegasus on our demand (during Monsoon Session of Parliament last year), it shows that they wanted to hide something from the people of the country.”   The money belongs to the public but these people are using it for snooping on people who are opposing them, he alleged.Kharge said if the government was doing it for the safety and security of the country, it was fine, but “they are using it against Opposition leaders, ministers and government functionaries, the judiciary and the media”.“They spoke a lie in Parliament,” he alleged.“If the government has courage, it should file a defamation suit against New York Times, which has published the report stating that the government had purchased the spyware. The truth has now come out,” Kharge said.Asked whether they will seek a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe again, the LOP said, “We will see what kind of probe needs to be done, we will discuss. We have raised this issue earlier too, and we will raise this issues in Parliament now”.Surjewala earlier alleged that the defence budget of National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) reporting to the NSA went up from Rs 33 Crore to Rs 333 Crore in 2017-18.He said that after the report, it is now clear that Modi government purchased the Pegasus spyware in 2017 and other military technology as the “centrepieces” of a package including “weapons and intelligence gear worth roughly USD 2 billion” from Israel during PM Modi’s visit.“The Modi government is the deployer and executor of the illegal and unconstitutional snooping and spying racket through Israeli surveillance spyware Pegasus and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is himself involved,” he said.“This is a brazen hijack of democracy and an act of treason,” the Congress leader alleged.The government had denied all allegations when the Opposition was.                                     #Pegasus||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/illegal-snooping-using-pegasus-amounts-to-treason-congress-on-nyt-report-on-the-spyware-365250
30-01-2022||New Delhi||India voted against Palestine at UN after Pegasus deal: Report||Israel offered Pegasus, a tool that cracked encrypted messages on iPhones and androids, to countries like India, Hungary and Mexico in order to ensure a shift in their positions at the UN, the New York Times has claimed in a year-long investigation.Also read: Illegal snooping using Pegasus amounts to treason: Congress on NYT report on spyware Pegasus was offered to PM Narendra Modi during an Indian Premier’s first-ever 2017 Israel visit as part of a $ 2 billion package that included missiles. Subsequently, India voted in favour of Israel by denying observer status at the UN’s Economic and Social Council to a Palestinian human rights organisation. “Access helped Israel win votes in the UN and to reach an accord with Arab adversaries,” reported the paper.The Indian part of the probe by a consortium of journalists showed that an overwhelming majority of mobile phones allegedly targeted by Pegasus were critics of the Modi government. But the government has said the report was a “sensational attempt” to “malign Indian democracy” while the Ambassador of Israel to India Naor Gilon has said all exports by NSO were supervised by Tel Aviv.The only country saved from the intrusion of Pegasus was the US. Tel Aviv pressured the parent company NSO to program Pegasus so it was incapable of dialling US numbers in order to prevent foreigners from spying on Americans. But NSO also sold the software to the FBI, relabelling it as Phantom that could attack US numbers. But in the end the FBI decided not to use it.Pegasus helped Mexican authorities capture El Chapo, European investigators bust terrorist plots and organised crime. But Mexico also used it against journalists and political dissidents. So did some of the Gulf monarchies such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia.The only country that has taken action is the US which added NSO to its “entity list” for activities “contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States”.                                      #Pegasus||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-voted-against-palestine-at-un-after-pegasus-deal-report-365247
