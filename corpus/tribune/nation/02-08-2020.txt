The system automatically adjusts and adapts to the surrounding ambient temperature without any human intervention. It has a Dual-Displays (day camera + infra-red) system that identifies passengers with elevated temperatures. To be extremely useful in the COVID pandemic, the authorities will be able to identify passengers who are potential COVID 19 positive and will be kept under observation. There are existing thermal scanners at the international arrivals. An official statement said GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited (GHIAL) that manages the airport that handled international relief flights under the government of India’s largest offshore evacuation programme of Vande Bharat Mission (VBM). All international arrival passengers and airline crew undergo mandatory health screening by the airport health officers to identify symptomatic passengers to contain the spread of Covid-19 and provide necessary medical assistance to such passengers. Pradeep Panicker, CEO, GHIAL, said in a statement, “We are thankful to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in having this modern equipment installed at the Hyderabad International Airport. We are grateful to the sponsors ADB and UNICEF for this humane gesture.”“The new top-end mass fever scanner at Hyderabad International Airport enhances our efficiency multi-fold.

02-08-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: JNCASR scientists develop forecasting model to estimate medical inventory requirements||Scientists at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bengaluru have developed a forecasting model to estimate the key aspects of medical inventory requirements during the coronavirus pandemic, a statement said on Sunday.The scientists of the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), an institution under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), tested the model by predicting the number of infections and deaths in Italy and New York state, based on an adaptive algorithm which uses early available data. The predictions closely matched the actual outcomes, it said.They have also carried out a similar exercise for India, where in addition to projecting the number of infections and deaths, they have projected the expected range of critical resource requirements for hospitalisation in a location.The calculation is required to scale up both the testing capabilities and critical care facilities, which are essential to reduce mortality.The team demonstrated that with this approach, there is universality to the evolution of the disease across countries, which can then be used to make reliable predictions.This approach allows for planning of requirements for critical resources such as ICUs and PPEs during the pandemic. The approach is designed for simplicity of interpretation and adaptability over time, the statement said.The model is based on the recent work of a team accepted for publication in the journal ‘Physical Review E’ in which they showed that uncertainties in parameters and reported infections can be compensated for by using (phase-space) representations.“This reduces errors, exploiting any universality across geographies which shows similar behaviour, and by a regular weekly update of the predictions made for a month,” it said.“It would be extremely relevant for COVID-19, as the disease character and behavioural patterns of people change and affect the efficacy of disease spread and management, in a second-wave, requiring constant alertness on the part of the forecasters,” the statement added.DST secretary Ashutosh Sharma said mathematical modelling and simulations are some of the key tools for understanding, planning and decision making in the time of COVID-19.“This example further brings to the fore the power of collaborations rather than competition among the best of research groups,” he said.

02-08-2020||New Delhi||New education policy misses fundamental goal of human development, expansion of knowledge: Congress||The Congress on Sunday said the new National Education Policy misses the fundamental goal of human development and expansion of knowledge, noting that it is high on “catchwords” and “verbosity” but lacks critical finances and a coherent roadmap for implementation.It alleged that the policy has circumvented parliamentary oversight and there has been no discussion with the academia except the RSS.Addressing a press conference here, Congress leaders MM Pallam Raju, Rajeev Gowda and Randeep Surjewala said the NEP seeks to create a digital divide between the poor and the rich as it promotes privatisation of public education and “this will lead to it going out of reach of the middle class and the disadvantaged in the society”.They also questioned the government’s intent in raising spending on education to 6 per cent of the GDP, saying the same has fallen from 4.14 per cent of GDP in 2014 to 3.2 per cent currently under the Modi government and is likely to fall further due to cuts in outlays on account of resource crunch due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“The National Education Policy 2020, which aimed to pave the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education, is high on catchwords, gloss, appearance and verbosity yet lacks a coherent implementational roadmap and strategy, clearly defined milestones and the critical finances necessary to execute this grand vision,” they said in a joint statement.“All in all, the NEP 2020 misses the fundamental goal of human development and expansion of knowledge,” they said.The Central government on Wednesday announced sweeping reforms under the new education policy that included teaching in mother tongue or regional language up to class 5, lowering the stakes of board exams, allowing foreign universities to set up campuses in India, a single regulator for higher education institutions except for law and medical colleges and common entrance tests for varsities.The Congress leaders said the timing of NEP in the middle of a pandemic when all educational institutions are closed is, in itself, questionable. More so when almost the entire academia has complained of no consultation, the leaders alleged.“On a policy that impacts and affects our present and future generations, even parliamentary oversight has been circumvented. Contrast this with the rigorous parliamentary and widespread consultation that preceded the Right to Education Act,” they said in the statement.Former HRD Minister Pallam Raju said “there are going to be severe challenges due to the over-centralisation of education sector”.“While the intent seems to be there, there are serious shortcomings in the policy,” he said.“In the later stages also, we would like to question, what is the roadmap? What is the resource allocation? How do you plan to implement the broad ideal of universalisation? There’s an intent expressed about online education. But there is a wide disparity in the access level for online education; not only due to personal affordability but also in terms of the quality of connectivity. This will bring a large digital divide”.Gowda, a former IIM faculty member, asked where the money is going to come from for funding the ambitious plans. “Or is it going to come out of people’s pockets,” he asked.“Any policy coming out of the Modi government must be assessed against its track record over the last 6 years, for example, the Delhi University. One of the first actions of this government was to abolish the 4-year programme in DU and now we’re turning back to it,” he added.Surjewala said the new policy will remain a document on paper as the required finances are not there, asking how does the government propose to fill 12 lakh vacancies of school teachers.As per official records, he added, only 10 per cent of government schools in the country have access to computers and only 4 per cent have network connectivity.“More than 70 pc children of marginalised sections may be completely excluded as seen during access to online classes in the Covid-19 period. This will also make the rural versus urban divide even stronger on account of absent or diminished internet connectivity/access to computers in the rural areas,” he alleged.“There is no mention of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other backward classes in the entire policy document. There is no discussion about these underprivileged sections who comprise of over 50 per cent of the country’s population,” he said.He said the NEP’s professed objective of “critical thinking, creative independence and spirit of enquiry remains empty rhetoric as the BJP regime has systematically attacked universities, obliterated institutional autonomy and stifled freedom of expression among teachers and students alike”.Alleging that an “atmosphere of fear, persecution, suppression and subjugation prevails as appointments of BJP-RSS ideologues to man educational institutions by sacrificing meritocracy, is the new normal”, he said there are several examples in this regard where there have been attacks on students in campuses.“Throwing well-established democratic structures for a top-down administration as envisaged by NEP 2020 will end up stifling creativity and critical thinking altogether,” he said.Setting up of Higher Education Commission of India as a single overarching body will make it one of the most centralised regulatory institutions, Surjewala said.“Needless to say, this will impede the evolution of higher education”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-education-policy-misses-fundamental-goal-of-human-development-expansion-of-knowledge-congress-121182
02-08-2020||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Suchetana Chattopadhyay’s book on Komagata Maru selected for Muzaffar Ahmed Memorial Prize||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, August 2Historian Suchetana Chattopadhyay’s book on Komagata Maru has been selected for the prestigious Muzaffar Ahmed Memorial Prize this year.Besides Chattopadhyay’s work — which throws light on how the British colonial police set up an elaborate system of surveillance on Sikh migrants returning to Punjab from North America and East Asia in the wake of the Komagata Maru firing incident — two other books, too, have been chosen for the award instituted in the memory of Ahmed, who was one of the founders of the Communist Party of India.The two latter books are written in Bengali. SK Nath will be awarded for his work on Akshay Kumar Datta, an intellectual stalwart from 19th century Bengal while Manabendranath Saha has been chosen for the award for his book on filmmaker Mrinal Sen.The award-winning book by Chattopadhyay, who teaches history at Kolkata’s Jadavpur University, is written in English.Named “Komagata Maru: Imperial Surveillance and Workers from Punjab in Bengal”, the book tells the fascinating story of how “the Punjabi Sikh emigrants became formal targets of the colonial repressive state apparatus” in the wake of the Komagata Maru incident.Chattopadhyay, a PhD from the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), London, is fond of Sikhs and it shows in her academic pursuits.Besides Komagata Maru, she has also written on the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and revolutionary activities among the Sikh cab drivers living in Kolkata when India was a British colony.The Tribune asked Chattopadhyay what was it that fascinated her about the Sikhs and Punjab? Was it the stories of the sacrifice by the Sikhs, the role played by the people of Punjab in India’s struggle for freedom or the popularity of Left-wing politics among a section of the Punjabis?“Everything, all these things,” Chattopadhyay answered.Former JNU professor Chaman Lal complimented Chattopadhyay on her being chosen for the Muzaffar Ahmed Memorial Award.“She has done painstaking research for the book which has turned out to be an absolutely first-rate work,” Chaman Lal said.Chattopadhyay and the other recipients will be the conferred the award in a function in Kolkata on August 5 on the occasion of 132nd birth anniversary of Muzaffar Ahmed.Komagata Maru, a Japanese steamship, sailed from Hong Kong for Vancouver with 376 Punjabi passengers on board in 1914. On being denied entry to Canada, it finally returned Budge Budge near Kolkata where the British police, suspecting the passengers of being sympathisers of the Ghadar Party, fired upon them when they tried to disembark. Twenty people, most of them Sikhs, died in the incident which took place in September 1914.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/suchetana-chattopadhyays-book-on-komagata-maru-selected-for-muzaffar-ahmed-memorial-prize-121180

02-08-2020||New Delhi||MHA seeks three additional months for framing CAA rules||The Home Ministry has sought an additional time of three-months for framing rules of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), officials said on Sunday.The plea was made before the Department Related Standing Committee for Subordinate Legislation as according to the Manual on Parliamentary Work, the rules for any legislation should be framed within six months of the Presidential assent or an extension must be sought.The controversial CAA, which facilitates granting of Indian citizenship to persecuted non-Muslim minorities of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, was passed by the Parliament nearly eight months ago and had led to protests in various parts of the country.The President had given his assent to the legislation on December 12, 2019.“The Home Ministry has sought an additional time of three months to frame the rules for the CAA. The plea was made before the Department Related Standing Committee for Subordinate Legislation,” a senior official told PTI.The Home Ministry’s move came after the panel enquired about the status of the rules for the CAA.The committee is likely to accept the request, the official said.The objective of the CAA is to grant Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities — Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Parsi and Christian — from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.People from these communities, who had come to India till December 31, 2014, due to religious persecution in these countries, will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.After the CAA was passed by the Parliament, widespread protests were witnessed in the country. Those opposing the CAA contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution. They also alleged that the CAA, along with the National Register of Citizens, was intended to target the Muslim community in India.However, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had dismissed the allegations and described the protests against the CAA as “mostly political”. He had asserted that no Indian would lose citizenship due to the Act.Clashes between pro and anti-CAA groups had spiralled into communal riots in Northeast Delhi early this year which had left at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.The Lok Sabha had passed the CAA legislation on December 9, 2019, and Rajya Sabha on December 11, 2019.The Manual on Parliamentary Work states: “Statutory rules, regulations and bye-laws will be framed within a period of six months from the date on which the relevant statute came into force.”The manual also states that in case the ministries/departments are not able to frame the rules within the prescribed period of six months, “they should seek an extension of time from the Committee on Subordinate Legislation stating reasons for such extension” which cannot be more than for a period of three months at a time.

He has not come forward before the police...Notice will be served if he does not appear, Inspector General, Patna Zone, Sanjay Singh told PTI.Pithani had alleged in an email to Mumbai police two days ago that he was being pressured by Rajput's family to record a statement against his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty.Pithani had said that he shared a professional relationship with the late actor.Singh said that IPS officer Vinay Tiwary, who is posted as City SP (Central) Patna, has already left for Mumbai to lead the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the case.Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey had Saturday said, if needed, an IPS officer would be sent to Mumbai to join the investigation.Pandey had also said that Bihar police team had failed to locate Rhea Chakraborty, whom Rajput's father has accused of abetting the actor's suicide.Rajput's father has also accused Chakraborty of wrongful confinement of the actor, spiriting away Rs 15 crore from one of his bank accounts, and having him undergo treatment for mental illness without keeping his family informed.A four-member team is already in Mumbai to probe the Bollywood actors death case after his father K K Singh lodged a police complaint in Patna on July 25, more than a month after his demise. Mumbai police is also parallelly probing the case.Several political leaders including Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi have alleged that Mumbai police was not cooperating with their Patna counterparts in the investigation."Uddhav Thackeray (Maharashtra CM) is under pressure from the Congress-funded Bollywood mafia. So it's bent on saving all the elements responsible in the case," the BJP leader had tweeted in Hindi on Saturday, and accused the Mumbai police of creating hurdles before the Bihar police team.Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey, meanwhile, said the state police team in Mumbai had not yet got any documents from the metropolitan police."Apart from the FIR that we have registered, we have nothing. We have not received the inquest report, postmortem report, video footage of the building.....That the investigation moves forward and truth is unravelled is the responsibility of both Mumbai and Bihar police. Sushant's death is not a simple matter," he told a TV news channel.

On June 10, for the first time, the total number of recovered patients exceeded the active cases with a difference of 1,573, which has increased to 5,77,899 as on today," it said.The successful and coordinated implementation of the effective containment strategy, aggressive testing and standardised clinical management protocols based on a comprehensive standard of care framework have resulted in a consistent trend of rising recovery rate and progressively reducing case fatality rate (CFR).  "India has one of the lowest case fatality rate at 2.13 pc as compared to the global average," the ministry said.    India's COVID-19 tally climbed to 17.50 lakh with 54,735 cases being reported in a day, while the death toll rose to 37,364 with 853 people succumbing to the disease in a span of 24 hours, data updated at 8 am showed.

The Trust was constituted by the Union government last year for construction of the temple and management of its affairs.The list of names of prospective attendees to the ceremony will be officially declared once it gets clearance from the office of Prime Minister Office (PMO).The VHP leaders are tight-lipped over the subject. Although they express ignorance regarding the names of attendees, there is apparent sense of disappointment at the prospect of not being physically present at the historic ceremony.Apparent sense of bewilderment in the matter pervades also among constituents of the ‘Sangh Parivar’, which is spear-headed by RSS.A leader in the know of developments relating to the Ram temple construction said the issue is between the Trust and the PMO.A source said that there is some secrecy over the guest list for two reasons: one is for security, because Prime Minister and other VVIPs will attend the event. The second reason is to avoid any controversy over the inclusion and omission of people to the event. This is primarily because the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates implementation of social distancing protocol.The source said that the names of attendees will be officially made public in Ayodhya, likely on the eve of the ceremony. However, those whose names have been shortlisted to attend the ceremony are being told unofficially, sources said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/secrecy-surrounds-list-of-invitees-to-ram-temple-event-in-ayodhya-121167

The work on it has started and new signages have been put up in Dadar," Dighavkar said.Images of the change at a signal were shared by Maharashtra minister and Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray who tweeted "if you've passed by Dadar, you'd see something that will make you proud. BMC is ensuring gender equality with a simple idea- the signals now have women too".He thanked Dighavkar, local Sena MLA Sada Sarvankar, city Mayor Kishori Pednekar and Brihanmumbai Municipal Commissioner IS Chahal.The permission to make the changes were given by the city traffic police to the BMC on July 17, officials added.Cities like Geneva in Switzerland, and Germany's Dresden, Cologne and Zwicko have female figures alongside male ones as part of the signage, officials said.Among the more famous ones is the pony-tailed female figure called "Sofie" installed in Amersfoot in Netherlands in 2000, while Vienna in Austria installed same-sex ones in 2015.

However, he did not receive any reply from the jail authorities even after he called them up over phone.After Saibaba’s mother died on Saturday, Sarode again called up the jail authorities to arrange for a phone call with the family, but he did not get any reply for it also, the lawyer said.Saibaba’s wife Vasantha said her mother-in-law Gokarakonda Suryavathi died at 1.40 pm on Saturday. She was undergoing cancer treatment at NIMS, Hyderabad, and her health was progressively getting worse.She was “desperately waiting to be reunited with her eldest son, GN Saibaba, currently languishing in prison under unfair charges”, she said in the statement on Saturday.The court rejected his bail petition and parole, where he expressed his desire to see his mother in her final moments. Her son could not see her for the past four years since his incarceration, Saibaba’s wife said.“I feel extremely saddened by the loss of this kind and caring woman and even deeply disappointed in myself that I could not fulfil her final wish of letting her meet her son,” she said, adding that the deceased had tested negative for coronavirus.In March 2017, a sessions court in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district convicted Saibaba and four others, including a journalist and a Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student, for Maoist links and engaging in activities amounting to “waging war against the country”.The court held Saibaba and others guilty under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).

02-08-2020||New Delhi||MD plans to use AI in weather forecasting||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) is planning to use artificial intelligence in weather forecasting, especially for issuing nowcasts, which can help improve 3-6 hours prediction of extreme weather events, its Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra said on Sunday.He said the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is not as prevalent as it is in other fields and it is relatively new in the area of weather forecasting.The IMD has invited research groups who can study how artificial intelligence (AI) be used for improving weather forecasting and the Ministry of Earth Sciences is evaluating their proposals, Mohapatra said.He said the IMD is also planning to do collaborative studies on this with other institutions.The IMD uses different tools like radars, satellite imagery, to issue nowcasts, which gives information on extreme weather events occurring in the next 3-6 hours.                 The IMD issues forecasts for extreme weather events like thunderstorms, dust storms. Unlike cyclones, predictions of thunderstorms, which also bring lightning, squall and heavy rains, are more difficult as the extreme weather events develop and dissipate in a very short period of time.Last month, over 160 people died due to lightning alone in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.The IMD wants to better the nowcast predictions through AI and machine learning.“Artificial intelligence helps in understanding past weather models and this can make decision-making faster,” Mohapatra said.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the US announced new strategies this year to expand the agency’s application of four emerging science and technology focus areas—NOAA Unmanned Systems, artificial intelligence, Omics, and the cloud --  to guide transformative advancements in the quality and timeliness of NOAA science, products and services.Omics is a suite of advanced methods used to analyse material such as DNA, RNA, or proteins.With regards to AI, it said the overarching goal of the NOAA Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy is to utilise AI to advance NOAA’s requirements-driven mission priorities.The NOAA said through this, it seeks to reduce the cost of data processing, and provide higher quality and more timely scientific products and services for societal benefits.

The idea is to generate evidence for improving the treatment of COVID-19 patients,” another official said.

"If Rhea has not done anything wrong then she should stop playing hide-and-seek with the police and come forward to clarify the things," the Bihar Police argued.Director-General of Bihar Police Gupteshwar Pandey, on Saturday, systematically interacted with media and explained many things related to the case. In the same sequence, Pandey told a TV channel that if Rhea does not believe herself guilty, then she should stop playing hide-and-seek (Chuhe-Billi ka khel) with the police and come to record her statement.Also read:'He was in depression, Rhea Chakraborty was his biggest support,' reveals Sushant Singh Rajput's therapistAnkita Lokhande explains why she didn’t attend Sushant Singh Rajput’s funeral'Sushant Singh Rajput kept sleeping', claims bodyguard; says ‘Rhea Chakraborty used to send me to fetch medicines’Sushant Singh Rajput's brother-in-law lashes out at therapist interview: 'Disclosing mental health information is illegal'Pandey said, "Why is Rhea running away? If he is not guilty, come forward and help the police in the investigation. We are not advocates of punishing an innocent. We would like her to stand up and if she succeeds in proving herself innocent, we will not even touch her. But if she runs away from me, then I will definitely say that we will definitely reach her one day and separate the milk from water." Actor Sushant had allegedly committed suicide in Mumbai on June 14 and his father K.K. Singh had lodged an FIR in Patna on July 25, in which Rhea has been named as the main accused. After the FIR was lodged in Patna, the Bihar Police have also reached Mumbai for the investigation.Meanwhile, Rhea has filed an application in the Supreme Court to hear the entire case in Mumbai instead of Patna. Sushant's father, through his lawyer Vikas Singh, has also filed a counter-petition to keep the case in Patna. The case is to be heard on August 5.Rhea is now absconding. The Bihar Police team had also visited her flat but could found her there. After this, Pandey admitted that the Bihar Police have not been able to 'locate' Rhea.Earlier, Rhea had released a video and claimed herself innocent. On this, Pandey said that instead of telling herself innocent through video, Rhea should record her statement before the police, this will be in her favour.Pandey said, "Rhea should put her side. We do not have any enmity with her, but if she continues to run in this way, then it will be difficult for her. I assure you that the Bihar Police are investigating at own level and the day we get the evidence against them, we will drag them out even from hell. The Bihar Police are fully capable of this task." On July 25, Sushant's father had registered a case against Rhea Chakraborty and her family members at Rajiv Nagar police station in Patna for abetting his son to suicide. After the registration of the case, the Bihar Police reached Mumbai and started investigating the case.

02-08-2020||New Delhi||New Education Policy: Breakfast for school children besides mid-day meals||The mid-day meals provided to students in government or aided schools should be supplemented by breakfast, the new National Education Policy (NEP) has proposed.       The policy which was approved by the Union Cabinet earlier this week has noted that morning hours after a nutritious breakfast can be particularly productive for the study of cognitively more demanding subjects and hence recommended expansion of the mid-day meal scheme to include provisions for breakfast in schools.“Children are unable to learn optimally when they are undernourished or unwell. Hence, the nutrition and health (including mental health) of children will be addressed, through healthy meals and the introduction of well-trained social workers, counsellors, and community involvement into the schooling system,” the policy said.“Furthermore, research shows that the morning hours after a nutritious breakfast can be particularly productive for the study of cognitively more demanding subjects and hence these hours may be leveraged by providing a simple but energizing breakfast in addition to mid-day meals,” it added.In locations where hot meals are not possible, a simple but nutritious meal—groundnuts or chana mixed with jaggery and local fruits may be provided.“All school children shall undergo regular health check-ups especially for 100 pc immunization in schools and health cards will be issued to monitor the same,” the policy said.The revised policy has proposed that prior to the age of 5 every child will move to a “preparatory class” or “balavatika”.“The learning in the preparatory class shall be based primarily on play-based learning with a focus on developing cognitive, affective, and psychomotor abilities and early literacy and numeracy. The mid-day meal programme shall also be extended to the preparatory Classes in primary schools.“Health check-ups and growth monitoring that are available in the anganwadi system shall also be made available to preparatory Class students of anganwadi as well as of primary schools,” the policy document said.The National Programme of Mid-Day Meal in Schools, popularly known as the Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDMS), is an on-going centrally-sponsored scheme which covers all school children studying in Classes 1 to 8 of government, government-aided schools, special training centres including ‘Madarsas’ supported under ‘Samagra Shiksha’.“As per the provisions of National Food Security Act, 2013, children studying in classes 1 to 8 or within the age group of 6-14 years are entitled to one mid day meal free of charge, every day except on school holidays, in all schools run by local bodies, government and government aided schools so as to meet nutritional standards specified in the Act,” a senior HRD Ministry official said.“However, some States and Union Territories provide additional items such as milk, egg and fruits to students from their own resources,” the official added.At least 11.59 crore elementary school students are beneficiaries under the mid-day meal scheme of the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry, while nearly 26 lakh cook-cum helpers are employed for the same.The Ministry also advised states during lockdown to provide mid-day meals or food security allowance to students till schools are closed due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.The NEP replaces the 34-year-old National Policy on Education framed in 1986 and is aimed at paving the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education systems to make India a global knowledge superpower.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-education-policy-breakfast-for-school-children-besides-mid-day-meals-121140

02-08-2020||New Delhi||India, China hold 5th round of military talks||Senior military commanders of India and China are holding a fresh round of talks on Sunday with an aim to ensure expeditious disengagement of troops from all the friction points along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh, military sources said.It is the fifth round of corps commander-level talks in nearly two months with an aim to defuse the border tensions triggered by a violent clash between the two militaries in Pangong Tso area in eastern Ladakh on May 5.The meeting was scheduled to start at 11 am in Moldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The sources said the Indian side will insist on total withdrawal of Chinese troops from the Finger areas in Pangong Tso at the earliest besides completing the disengagement process on a couple of other friction points.The previous round of corps commander-level talks took place on July 14 and lasted for nearly 15 hours.In the talks, the Indian side had conveyed a “very clear” message to the Chinese army that the status quo ante must be restored in eastern Ladakh and it will have to follow all mutually agreed protocols for border management to bring back peace and tranquillity in the area.The Indian delegation also apprised the China People’s Liberation Army (PLA) about the “red lines” and conveyed that the onus was largely on China to improve the overall situation in the region.After the talks, the Army said both sides are committed to “complete disengagement” of troops, adding that the process is “intricate” and requires “constant verification”.The Chinese military has pulled back from Galwan Valley and certain other friction points but the withdrawal of troops has not moved forward from the Finger areas in Pangong Tso as demanded by India, sources said.India has been insisting that China must withdraw its forces from areas between Finger Four and Eight. The mountain spurs in the area are referred to as Fingers.On July 24, India and China held another round of diplomatic talks on the border issue.After the talks, the Ministry of External Affairs said both sides agreed that an early and complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC in accordance with bilateral agreement and protocols was essential for overall development of relations between the two nations.The formal process of disengagement of troops began on July 6, a day after a nearly two-hour telephonic conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on ways to bring down tension in the area.In Sunday’s talks, the Indian delegation was set to be led by Lt Gen Harinder Singh, the Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, while the Chinese side was to be headed by Major General Liu Lin, Commander of the South Xinjiang military region.The sources said the focus of the talks would be on finalising a framework for a “time-bound and verifiable” disengagement process from all the friction points like Pangong Tso and Depsang and pulling back large numbers of troops and weapons from rear bases along the LAC.The first round of the corps commander talks was held on June 6 during which both sides finalised an agreement to disengage gradually from all the standoff points beginning with Galwan Valley.However, the situation deteriorated following the Galwan Valley clash on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out any details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.Following the Galwan Valley incident, the government has given the armed forces “full freedom” to give a “befitting” response to any Chinese misadventure along the LAC.The Army has sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the border following the deadly clashes. The IAF has also moved air defence systems as well as a sizable number of its frontline combat jets and attack helicopters to several key air bases.

02-08-2020||Bangalore||UK considering a coin to commemorate Mahatma Gandhi||Britain is considering minting a coin to commemorate Mahatma Gandhi, amid growing interest in recognizing the contributions of people from the Black, Asian and other minority ethnic communities.British Finance Minister Rishi Sunak asked the Royal Mint Advisory Committee (RMAC) in a letter to pursue recognition of individuals from those communities, the UK Treasury said in an emailed statement late on Saturday.“RMAC is currently considering a coin to commemorate Gandhi,” the Treasury said.Gandhi, who was born in 1869, advocated for non-violence throughout his life and played a key role in India’s struggle for independence. His birthday, October 2, is observed as the International Day of Non-Violence.Often referred to as India’s “father of the nation”, he was assassinated by a Hindu radical on Jan. 30, 1948, just a few months after he led India to freedom from British rule.As part of a global reassessment of history, colonialism and racism triggered by the death in May of a Black man, George Floyd, in the United States after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, some British institutions have begun re-examining their past.Many organizations have taken initiatives to make investments to help the Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities and to support racial diversity. Floyd’s death has led to global protests against racism, colonialism and police brutality.In his letter to the RMAC, Sunak said members of the BAME communities have made a “profound contribution” and that the committee should consider recognizing it on the UK’s coinage.The RMAC is an independent committee made up of experts who recommend themes and designs for coins to Britain’s finance minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  --Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-considering-a-coin-to-commemorate-mahatma-gandhi-121131

Besides, the reforms would help explore students’ potential, he added. The old education system created a mass of graduates, who could not put their knowledge to practical use, the PM said. The new policy would produce job creators instead of job seekers.Narendra Modi, Prime Minister‘Policy aims at making India global edu hub’Regional languages have languished for years but the the policy ensures that Indian languages prosper. It invites world’s top institutes to set up campuses in India and will help make India a global education hub“NEP, 2020, aims to change that approach and plug previous loopholes, where students were being forced to study subjects under pressure from parents and society.”“With NEP, 2020, we are shifting from the burden of the school bag, which does not last beyond school to the boon of learning that helps for life, from simply memorising to critical thinking,” he said, hailing the Indian youth for offering a range of solutions, including Aarogya Setu application and face shields during Covid times.Addressing students at Smart India Hackathon, in which students are competing to find solutions to a set of problems posed to them by the government and industry, the PM said even today many students felt they were being judged on the basis of one subject in which they did not even have interest.“The policy emphasises on inter-disciplinary study. This concept has been gaining popularity because one size does not fit all and one subject does not define who you are,” Modi said, adding that students could now learn math with music.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nep-focuses-on-making-job-creators-not-job-seekers-pm-121011

It turned the movement launched by the Congress into a people’s movement.”Highlighting Tilak’s contribution to bringing about social reforms, the Home Minister said the great leader agitated against cow slaughter, as he also fought for women’s rights, published the Kesari newspaper and even turned Shiv Jayanti and Ganpati festivals into a public movement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tilak-made-freedom-struggle-indian-shah-121012

02-08-2020||KV Prasad||A politician with relations across spectrum||Amar Singh, who passed away in Singapore today following prolonged illness, was one of his kind among hoards of politicians in the Capital. For over a decade, he strutted around the corridors of powers with a reach across a wide spectrum of people.Having found little success in the Congress, Amar Singh’s political graph rose during 1996-98 in the United Front government as he struck a unique relation with “Netaji” Mulayam Singh Yadav, the powerful chief of the regional Samajwadi Party (SP).For a person who was equally at ease with the glamour world of Mumbai and corporate honchos, Amar Singh became the “go-to person” in Delhi for his ability to get things done on the phone. The early days of post first phase of liberalisation saw Amar Singh play a role in giving a push to reforms in the telecom and petroleum sector, a contribution recalled by former Union Minister Jairam Ramesh today.That Amar Singh was highly driven is a trait acknowledged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who, in his tweet, recalled him as an energetic public figure. He wrote Amar Singh witnessed some of the major political developments from close quarters and was known for friendship across many spheres of life.Amar Singh’s closeness to Netaji became part of the political folklore, making many wonder how a person who did not hide his connections with the rich and glamorous could be part of a charmed circle of Yadav, the wrestler-turned-politician in a socialist mould. The association of an unabashed consumerist in a socialist set up caused deep dismay among ‘Lohia ke Log (Followers of Ram Manohar Lohia)’ in the party.The magic was not limited to Netaji. Amar Singh’s appeal extended to veteran Marxist Harkishan Singh Surjeet to some extent. So much so that when Amar Singh, who portrayed himself as someone who could get political leaders of diverse views break bread together, was not invited to the celebratory dinner hosted by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi in May 2004, it was Surjeet who took him along. Yet, in 2008, it was Amar Singh’s intervention that made Yadav change his stand and support the nuclear deal that nearly wrecked UPA-1.Amar Singh, the once powerful general secretary of the SP, found his utility diminishing and over the next few years, his ties with the party strained to the extent that he was out of it in 2010.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-politician-with-relations-across-spectrum-121016
02-08-2020||New Delhi||N Ram, Shourie challenge contempt provision in Supreme Court||Former Union minister Arun Shourie, veteran journalist N Ram and activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan have moved the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of “criminal contempt”, contending it has a “chilling effect” on free speech.They have challenged Section 2(c)(i) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, that defines “criminal contempt” as publication of anything — whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever — which scandalises or tends to scandalise, or lowers the authority of any court.Section 2(c)(I) was a manifestly arbitrary and vague provision of law that violated right to equality and right to free speech guaranteed under the Constitution, they contended in the petition filed on Friday. “The broad and ambiguous wording of the impugned sub-section violates Article 14 by leaving the offence open to differing and inconsistent applications. This uncertainty in the manner in which the law applies renders it manifestly arbitrary and violates the right to equal treatment,” they submitted.The trio argued that “it is incompatible with preambular values and basic features of the Constitution as it violates Article 19(1)(a).”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/n-ram-shourie-challenge-contempt-provision-in-supreme-court-120989

If the party high command forgives, I shall embrace them.” Since the power tussle between him and Sachin Pilot resurfaced last month, the Congress veteran has used harsh words against his former deputy, once even referring to him as ‘nikamma’ (useless). But Gehlot said he would do whatever the Congress leadership wants. He said the party trusted him and he has been a Union minister, AICC general secretary, state unit president and Chief Minister for a third time.Ashok Gehlot, CMEnd the drama: CM to Modin a democracy, fights happen over ideology and policies, not for toppling a government.
