A cheating and forgery case was registered under IPC, Epidemic Diseases Act and Information Technology Act,” Inspector PT Chaudhary said.Soon after it was posted, the advertisement was taken off the website.“Despite him not being authorised to sell government property, this unidentified person posted the advertisement on OLX to defame the government and mislead people,” stated a release from the chief administrator of the Statue of Unity.Such an advertisement hurts the sentiments of the several crore people who idolise Sardar Patel, it added.

05-04-2020||New Delhi||Ban Tablighi Jamaat and its Markaz: VHP||The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) called for a complete ban on the Tablighi Jamaat and its Nizamuddin Markaz on Sunday, after it emerged as a COVID-19 hotspot in the country.The Tablighi Jamaat’s Markaz (headquarters) in Delhi’s Nizamuddin West emerged as a coronavirus hotspot as hundreds of people, who attended a religious congregation there in the second week of March, tested positive for COVID-19.Several others spread across the country, who attended the Tablighi Jamaat, are suspected to be carriers of the deadly virus.Stating that because of the Tablighi Jamaat and its Markaz, the entire country was facing a COVID-19 crisis, VHP’s joint general secretary Surendra Jain said it should be banned and all its bank accounts sealed, while alleging that the organisation was a nursery and nourisher of Islamic radicalism and terror.After the hard work and achievements of the pan-India lockdown, the whole country was taking a sigh of relief, but due to the Tablighi Jamaat, the possibilities of community transmission of the fatal virus had increased, VHP spokesperson Vinod Bansal said in a statement.At least 1,023 COVID-19 cases in the country have been found to be linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation, but massive efforts by various authorities have led to nearly 22,000 people associated with the religious grouping and their primary contacts being quarantined, a Union Health Ministry official said here on Saturday.The government has also launched a nationwide search for participants to the huge religious gathering amid fears that thousands present there could have carried the infection across the length and breadth of the country.

They are misbehaving with the medical staff and the cops.”Since the police action at the Markaz in Nizamuddin locality here in view of it becoming the hotspot of coronavirus, Mohammad Saad immediately went into hiding and claimed he had quarantined himself.According to intelligence sources, Saad is making full use of the “quarantine period” to muster support for himself among the Jamaatis, who are being whipped by police to isolation centres to avoid spread of the infection.Intelligence sources, who are working in coordination with the police, said that Saad could probably be hiding in the house of one of his supporters in the NCR region.The police forces have been asked to keep close vigil on his all possible hideouts, which includes his residence here in Zakir Nagar locality.But the forces have been told not to zero in on Saad for the time being.Saad in an audio message claimed that he has quarantined himself, as doctors have asked him to do so, but it still not known whether he has been tested positive for COVID-19.The notice sent to Mohammad Saad with 26 questions has been returned—mostly unanswered—with a statement that said that he will answer the question after his quarantine period is over and the Markaz is opened, the official in the security establishment said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/police-told-to-delay-tablighi-jamaat-chiefs-arrest-in-view-of-possible-violence-66029

At present there are only 228 active positive cases in the state.Opposition parties have criticised the move of the GHMC of banning the NGOs from helping the poor and needy saying the government has failedto reach out to the needy and is also preventing others from carrying out humanitarian work.Chairman of the Congress Minorities committee Sameer Waliullah said this would have a negative impact on the poor, especially those living in slums.At the same time, a message on behalf of around 80 serving and retired Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Indian Police Service (IPS) officers is being circulated in the two Telugu states among the Muslim population with an appeal to adhere to social distancing norms and not to give anyone an opportunity to accuse the religious community of spreading the virus.The officers have written “distressing videos are in wide circulation showing stone pelting at health workers, and clash of men from Muslim community with police personnel who are enforcing the law……….act responsibly and stand out as examples for fellow citizens in the fight against corona virus”, the appeal reads.Telangana Chief Minister K Chandershekhar Rao (KCR) is holding a meeting late on Sunday with state officials to assess the situation and decide a further course of action to contain the spread ofCOVID-19.Meanwhile, the Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy has also appealed to the people “to stand united in the challenging timesof corona virus”. On Tablighi Jamaat meeting, he said: “It should be seen as an unfortunate incident but not as an intentional one.”Telangana Health Minister E Rajendra has said so far there was no community transmission of COVID-19 in Telangana. All the positive cases being reported are either those who returned after participating in the Delhi religious congregation or those who mingled with them.According to the data released by the Telangana Government Hyderabad has had the maximum case numbering to over a hundred.

05-04-2020||Vijay Mohan||Army defers release in premature retirement cases in view of Covid crisis||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, April 5The army on Sunday deferred till June 30 the release of personnel who had opted for premature retirement and were earlier scheduled to hang up their boots in the next two months.“In view of the fight against #COVID19, SOS dates for all Pre-Mature Retirement of #IndianArmy officers extended till 30 June 2020. Individual letters to all will be issued after lockdown period,” a tweet by the Additional Directorate General Public Relations stated. SOS means ‘struck off strength’.The moves comes in the wake of a nationwide lockdown to combat COVID-19 that has mandated reduced staff strength in government offices so that only essential services are maintained.Retention of personnel till the situation returns to normal also addresses the issue of manpower requirements in case of any exigency. The Army has come up with a blue print to recall veterans to augment its strength if required.The Armed Forces personnel are also engaged in combating COVID-19 pandemic. While the Air Force is constantly ferrying critically required medical supplies and emergency equipment to far flung areas, the forces are also running quarantine camps for travellers who have returned from abroad and providing medical teams and support to civilian authorities. The forces are also on the standby to assist civilian administration in maintaining law and order and undertake internal security duties if the need so arises.Armed Forces personnel can opt for premature retirement if they are superseded or on medical and compassionate grounds if they have completed the minimum required service for grant of pension. A detailed policy and comprehensive instructions exist on the subject. According to sources, about 50,000 personnel have opted for premature retirement in the past five years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-defers-release-in-premature-retirement-cases-in-view-of-covid-crisis-66020
05-04-2020||New Delhi||Govt tightens export ban norms for anti-malarial drug hydroxycloroquine||The government has tightened the export ban norms on anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine by including special economic zones (SEZs) under its prohibition ambit to ensure there is no shortfall during COVID-19 crisis.US President Donald Trump has said that he has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release the amount of hydroxychloroquine ordered by the US after India last month banned the drugs for exports.“I called Prime Minister Modi of India this morning. They make large amounts of hydroxychloroquine. India is giving it a serious consideration,” Trump said at his daily news conference at the White House on Saturday.With more than three lakh confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and over 8,000 fatalities, the US has emerged as the worst sufferers of the deadly coronavirus disease to which there has been no cure.The drug is also not allowed to be shipped by export oriented units (EOUs) or under any export promotion scheme.“The export of hydroxycloroquine and formulations made from hydroxycloroquine...is no longer allowed from SEZs/EOUs or against advance authorisation or against full advance payment...The export shall remain prohibited without any exception,” the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has said in a notification.Under advance authorisation (AA) scheme, firms are allowed to import raw material at zero duty but with the condition of export obligation within a certified time frame. SEZs are treated as foreign territory in terms of customs laws.Normally export ban or restrictions imposed by the government does not apply on these zones as well as EOUs, which are specially meant to promote outbound shipments from the country.In the case of export restrictions imposed on certain APIs and formulations, the government clarified that these curbs would not be applicable for units in special economic zones (SEZs).Exporters availing AA scheme benefits too get these exemptions. But now the government has decided to include all this under the ambit of export ban due to the outbreak of coronavirus and increase in demand for this medicine.The move assumes significance as Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating healthcare workers handling suspected or confirmed coronavirus cases and also the asymptomatic household contacts of the lab-confirmed cases.On March 25, the government banned export of anti-malarial drug hydroxycloroquine with immediate effect to ensure sufficient availability of the medicine in the domestic market.In that notification, the DGFT had stated that export will be permitted from the SEZ and EOUs and in cases where the outbound shipment is made to fulfil export obligation under any advance authorisation license issued on or before the date of this notification, which is March 25, 2020.Exports were earlier also allowed by India to other countries on humanitarian grounds on case to case basis on the recommendation of the Ministry of External Affairs.Besides, it was allowed in case of shipments where irrevocable letter of credit has been issued or in case where full advance payment has been received by the exporter in India against specific shipment.With Trump describing hydroxychloroquine as a “game changer” in the fight against COVID-19 and several countries, including India, approving it for emergencies, pharmacies are reporting a surge in demand for the drug yet to be proven as a cure for the virus.Over the last few weeks, India has banned exports of host of medical devices, including sanitisers, all types of ventilators and surgical masks.There is a shortage of hand sanitiser and face masks in the market amid the coronavirus outbreak as people resorted to panic buying.

They are 379 Indonesians, 110 Bangladeshi, 77 Kyrgyzstan, 75 Malaysian, 65 Thai, 63 Myanmarese and 33 Sri Lankan citizens besides others.The Home Ministry had also asked Delhi Police and police chiefs of other states, where these foreigners are currently living, to take legal action under the Foreigners Act and the Disaster Management Act.The Home Ministry had said about 2,100 foreigners have come to India since January 1 and indulged in Tablighi activities in different parts of the country.

05-04-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus not airborne infection, cases doubling in 4.1 days: Centre||The government on Sunday directed all district heads to ensure seamless functioning of pharma units making devices and medicines, while the education minister said a decision on reopening of schools and colleges will be taken on April 14 after a review of the coronavirus threat in an indication that the 21-day lockdown could be lifted as scheduled.The health ministry said the death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 83 and the cases climbed to 3,577 in the country on Sunday after 505 new infections were reported in the past 24 hours.The active COVID-19 cases stand at 3,219, while 274 people were either cured or discharged and one had migrated, the ministry stated. However, a PTI tally based on figures reported by states directly showed at least 126 deaths across the country, while the confirmed cases reached 4,111. Of them, 315 have been cured and discharged.According to the Health Ministry data, Delhi has reported the highest number of confirmed cases at 503.Asserting that there was no evidence that coronavirus was an airborne infection, the health ministry also said the rate of doubling of COVID-19 cases in India is 4.1 days currently, but if the cases linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation would not have happened, it would have been 7.4 days."If it was an airborne infection then in a family -- whoever has a contact -- they all should come positive because they are living in same surrounding as the patient and the family is breathing the same air. When someone is admitted in hospital, other patient would have got exposure (if it was air borne) but that is not the case,” an official of the Indian Council of Medical Research said.Unsure of what turn the COVID-19 pandemic will take in India, various key ministries and departments have cautiously started to chalk out re-emergence plans and strategies to come out of the 21-day nationwide coronavirus lockdown.Globally, the pandemic has claimed more than 65,600 lives gand inflicted over 12 lakh people The focus of the Central and state governments currently appeared to be on two key aspects ---continuing with efforts on a war footing to contain the fast-spreading virus, and working on exit and “staggered re-emergence” from the lockdown.While making it clear that a decision on how and when to restore passenger services will be taken in coming weeks, sources in the Indian Railway said several proposals were being looked at as it was gearing up for the end of the lockdown on April 14.From making passengers wear masks to using the Arogya Setu app to check their health status before allowing them to travel and encouraging social distancing on board are a few proposals that are being looked at, sources said.With all schools and other educational institutes closed in the country due to the coronavirus lockdown, Union HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' said the government will take a decision on reopening of schools and colleges on April 14 after reviewing the situation.In an interview to PTI, he said the safety of students and teachers is of utmost importance to the government and his ministry is prepared to ensure there is no academic loss to students if schools and colleges needed to remain shut beyond April 14.In continued efforts to fight the virus, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba instructed district level officials to ensure that pharma units making devices and medicines run seamlessly. The direction came a day after India put curbs on exports of diagnostic kits with a view to discourage shipments and meet domestic requirement.Gauba met Sunday with district magistrates, superintendents of police, chief medical officers, state and district surveillance officers, state health secretaries and district health secretaries and chief secretaries, Joint Secretary in the health ministry Lav Agarwal said.With a rise in number of coronavirus cases in the national capital, Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal has directed the health department to identify private hospitals which can be taken over by the government, official sources said on Sunday.They said the government has limited resources and hence ICU wards, beds and other facilities of private hospitals can be used to deal with the increasing numbers of coronavirus cases.Officials have been asked to prepare a list of private hospitals that can be taken over if needed."In a recent meeting, the LG directed officials to prepare a list of private hospitals which can be taken over by government in case a need arises and their infrastructure can be used to treat COVID-19 patients. The government will provide treatment to coronavirus patients admitted at these hospitals," a source said.

"All political activity has stopped in Maharashtra and elected representatives are busy with relief work in their constituencies," a Shiv Sena leader from suburban Mumbai said.It is not clear when the elections will be held as there are no signs of the pandemic ebbing.Shiv Sena leaders said the party will consult legal experts once the lockdown ends on April 14.

Commonly available A-4 size transparency sheets used in overhead projectors are being used as visors while the holding frame is manufactured through Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), commonly known as 3-D printing. Polylactic Acid filament, a biodegradable thermoplastic derived from renewable resources such as corn starch or sugarcane, was used for 3-D printing.The enclosures were requested by PGIMER’s Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care to act as first level of protection for doctors and medical staff during the intubation of COVID-19 patients. This is a process in which a tube is inserted into the patient’s mouth to keep the airway open so that the patient can be placed on a ventilator.Made of perspex sheets the transparent enclosure is a cuboid that covers the patient’s face and upper chest, with two holes on one side through which a doctor has insert his arms to work. Medical professionals are at elevated levels of risk of infection as virus particles can become aerosolised during intubation.Mass production of the products is planned using injection moulding technique to expedite the process. Industrial partners are also being developed to meet the possible demands from neighbouring states. Being a research laboratory, in-house production in TBRL is limited.Dr Manjit said that TBRL is also making hand sanitizers for the Chandigarh Police using base compositions developed by the DRDO. The requirement is for 6,000 bottles of 500 ml and 1,200 bottles have already been supplied. TBRL was to get the sanitizers bottled from a commercial plant in Baddi in Himachal Pradesh, but the area has been sealed-off due to the death of an infected person. Alternate measures are being explored.In addition, TBRL is also acting as a facilitator for the procurement of bio-suits developed by another DRDO lab for use by health care service providers. A walk-through disinfection tunnel, which is placed at the entrance to a building or complex, is also being evaluated at TBRL. Developed by Research Center Imarat, Hyderabad, the tunnel is equipped with sensors to assess body parameters, air showers and disinfectant sprays. It has the potential of being deployed at any public place or office complex.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-drdos-missile-lab-develops-face-shields-safety-enclosures-for-doctors-66002

No doctor at the hospital turned us away citing our religion." He added that, "My wife was referred form Sikiri to Bharatpur, and doctors further referred her to Jaipur after administering an injection. My wife was given treatment."In a probe conducted by the District Collector on Sunday, the woman's husband and sister denied of any discrimination by the attending doctor who referred her to Jaipur, sources said.Before her, there were eight other pregnant women from the minority community, who were admitted to hospital and delivered babies without any discrimination, sources added. If she was turned away, how come she was admitted to the same hospital after her baby delivery in the ambulance, the probe committee headed by UIT Secretary said.In an interaction with probe committee, the woman's sister denied of "any discrimination by anyone". Khan had earlier reportedly told mediapersons: “I reached the district hospital on Saturday morning where a lady doctor asked me about my details. She allegedly said you are a Muslim and you cannot be treated here. She asked another doctor to refer us to Jaipur,” he said.“I moved out of the hospital with my wife. My wife delivered in an ambulance and my baby died due to negligence of doctors,” Khan said.Health Minister Subhash Garg said the matter is being investigated by a team of the district administration. He denied of any such refusal to the patient on religion lines by the said hospital.Meanwhile, Tourism Minister Vishvendra Singh in a series of tweets blamed his own Congress government for suppressing the truth.“It is clear from the videos that the government is trying to suppress the truth. I am cabinet minister and do not speak without proof. Please do not cover up,” he said in a tweet tagging former state-cadre IAS officer Arvind Mayaram.In another tweet, Singh said, “The Jamaat was/is a national disaster and hazard. But innocent Muslims suffering like this is painful. It does not mean that citizens of Islamic faith are treated the way a pregnant lady was handled by doctors in Bharatpur.”  Agencies/OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pregnant-woman-loses-child-in-rajasthan-as-docs-allegedly-refuse-treatment-over-religion-65998

Rajkot is considered as an engineering hub. Small scale industries of Rajkot supply engineering parts to NASA, ISRO, Railways and for defence production, Rupani said.“I am happy to announce that an industrialist from Rajkot has been successful in manufacturing ventilators in just 10 days. They designed it, made a prototype, procured parts and successfully built ventilators. Their testing has been done and certification has been completed. It is being used on patients from Saturday,” he told reporters.Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, who is also Gujarat’s health minister, said the company, Jyoti CNC Automation Limited, has not only passed engineering requirements for the machine but also successfully cleared medical requirements at the testing lab.“Chief Minister Rupani took special interest and invited industries to come forward and help to fight this global threat. He did regular follow-ups with the industry and assured and provided all help so that ventilators can be indigenously manufactured,” Patel said.Jyoti CNC has decided to donate first 1,000 ventilators to the Gujarat government, he said.The company’s owner Prakaramsinh Jadeja said they were given the task which was difficult to achieve in this period of lockdown.“A team of nearly 150 people has been working day and night for last 10 days to develop a ‘Made in India’ ventilator. Due to the lockdown and ban on international travel and goods movement, we cannot procure any parts from abroad. So we procured the ventilator parts from 26 different companies in India, Jadeja said.The ventilator developed by the company has been named as ‘Dhaman 1’, which is the base model and fulfils the requirement of COVID-19 patients, he said, adding that later more advanced models will be developed.Jadeja said the market cost of a single ventilator is Rs 6.5 lakh, but they have been able to manufacture it at a cost below Rs 1 lakh.“We will donate 1,000 ventilators to the Gujarat government. We have got the capacity of manufacturing 100 ventilators per day and after three days, we will ramp up the capacity as per the demand,” he said.“Many state governments are in touch with us and after providing ventilators to Gujarat, we will supply it to other states,” he added.Till Saturday, Gujarat reported 108 cases of coronavirus and 10 deaths.

They make large amounts of Hydroxychloroquine. India is giving it a serious consideration,” Trump said at his daily news conference at the White House on Saturday.India’s Directorate General of Foreign Trade on March 25 banned the export of Hydroxychloroquine but said that certain shipments on humanitarian grounds may be allowed on a case-by-case basis.With more than three lakh confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and over 8,000 fatalities, the US has emerged as the global epicentre of the deadly coronavirus disease to which there has been no cure.Trump said he would appreciate if India releases the amount of Hydroxychloroquine that the US has ordered.“And I said I would appreciate if they (India) would release the amounts that we ordered,” he said, without mentioning that quantity of Hydroxychloroquine that has been ordered by US companies from India.Scientists across the world are racing against time to find either a vaccine or a therapeutic cure to the virus that has so far killed more than 64,000 people and infected 1.2 million in more than 150 countries.Based on some initial results, the Trump administration is banking heavily on using Hydroxychloroquine for the successful treatment of coronavirus.Following a quick provisional approval from the US Food and Drug Administration last Saturday, the malaria drug along with a combination of some other drug is being used in the treatment of about 1,500 COVID-19 patients in New York, the epicentre in the US.According to Trump, the drug is yielding positive results. If successful, he told reporters that it would be a gift from heaven.In the next several weeks, health experts in the US have projected between 1,00,000 to 2,00,000 deaths due to the coronavirus, which due to human-to-human transmission is spreading like a wildfire in the country.In anticipation of it being a successful drug in the treatment of coronavirus, the US has already stockpiled some 29 million doses of Hydroxychloroquine.It is in this context Trump requested Modi to help US get millions of doses of Hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that can be produced at mass scale in India.Prime Minister Modi on Saturday said he held a detailed discussion on the coronavirus crisis with President Trump and resolved to deploy the full strength of the Indo-US partnership to fight the global pandemic.“We had a good discussion and agreed to deploy the full strength of the India-US partnership to fight COVID-19,” Modi wrote on Twitter on his “extensive” telephonic conversation with Trump.The prime minister and the US president exchanged views on the pandemic and its impact on the global well-being and economy, a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said.Stressing on the special relationship between the two countries, Modi reiterated India’s solidarity with the US in overcoming this global crisis together.“The two leaders agreed to deploy the full strength of the India-US partnership to resolutely and effectively combat COVID-19,” the PMO said.Modi and Trump also exchanged notes on the steps taken in their countries for mitigating the health and economic impacts of the pandemic.The two leaders also touched upon the significance of practices such as yoga and ayurveda for ensuring physical and mental well-being in these difficult times, the PMO statement said.They agreed that their officials would remain in close touch as regards the global health crisis, it added.Modi also conveyed deep condolences for the loss of lives in the US and his prayers for an early recovery of those still suffering from the disease.The discussion came at a time when both countries are in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Trump administration has made Hydroxychloroquine as part of its Strategic National Stockpile.Trump said that people in malaria affected-countries take Hydroxychloroquine and not many people are infected by coronavirus.Trump said that he would take Hydroxychloroquine, if needed.“I think people should if it were me, in fact, I might do it anyway. I may take it, Ok? I may take it. And, I’ll have to ask my doctors about that, but I may take it,” he said in response to a question.

05-04-2020||Johannesburg||S African Muslim cleric dies of coronavirus after attending Nizamuddin congregation||A South African Muslim cleric, who recently returned from India after attending the Nizamuddin congregation, has died after contracting the novel coronavirus, according to his family members.Moulana Yusuf Tootla, 80, attended the March 1-15 Tablighi Jamaat congregation in the Nizmuddin area, that has emerged as the epicentre for the spread of the coronavirus in different parts of India and abroad after thousands of people took part in it.Tootla, who died on Tuesday, was buried after his body was collected in a bag by the Islamic Burial Council (IBC).The Nizamuddin area is famed for the shrine of the 14h century Sufi mystic Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya.Indian authorities have launched a nationwide search for participants of the huge religious gathering amid fears that thousands present there could have carried the infection to the length and breadth of the country.Various nationals, particularly from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Kyrgyzstan come for Tabligh activities in Delhi.A family member of the cleric, on the basis of anonymity, told local media that Tootla began showing flu-like symptoms on his return from India.Subsequent tests at a private facility revealed that he had the virus.“By the past weekend Tootla had almost fully recovered from his treatment, but by Monday morning he started feeling ill again.“His condition deteriorated rapidly,” the family member said.Tootla was reportedly advised not to travel to India for the gathering, but he was adamant to go.He had participated in scores of similar gatherings across the globe, according to fellow clerics, but none of whom could confirm if other South Africans had also attended.“He (Tootla) said his fate is in Allah’s hands, as He (God) had already decided when he would recall him,” said the family member.Tootla’s extended family is in self-isolation for 14 days, although none of them have tested positive for the virus.IBC chairperson Salim Kazi said small adjustments were made for Muslim burials to ensure compliance with the government guidelines during the 21-day nationwide lockdown which is now in its 8th day.The guidelines restrict the number of people who can attend a funeral, so hundreds of people who had known the Islamic leader had to be advised to offer prayers for him in their homes.According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre, South Africa has 1,585 COVID-19 cases and nine people have died of the disease in the country.Meanwhile, majority of the people who tested positive for the disease in New Delhi are those who took part in the religious congregation.According to Delhi’s Health Department, 301 patients out of the 445 cases in the state are those participated in the Tablighi Jamaat, and Chief Minister Kejriwal said that the number of cases could spike as all 2,300 people evacuated from the Tablighi’s ‘markaz’ were being tested. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/s-african-muslim-cleric-dies-of-coronavirus-after-attending-nizamuddin-congregation-65958

It is suggested that people not suffering from medical conditions or having breathing difficulties may use the handmade reusable face cover, particularly when they step out of their house and especially if they live in densely populated areas. This face cover is not recommended for either health workers or those working with or in contact with Covid-19 patients or patients themselves as these categories of people are required to wear specified protective gear like N95 masks,” said the advisory.Health Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said the advisory was for homemade covers not masks.“Our old guidelines on masks are intact. Medical masks are to be used only by health workers and people caring for Covid-19 patients. Other people in densely populated communities should use homemade face and mouth covers. Every family member should use a different cover,” he said.The advisory asks people to arrange two sets of face covers so that one can be washed while the other is used.“Hand washing will still remain essential criteria and hands should be washed before wearing the face cover. Such face covers should not be thrown anywhere but kept safely, washed properly with soap and hot water and dried properly before they are used. These face covers could be made out of clean cloth available at home, which needs to be thoroughly cleaned and washed before a face cover is stitched or made,” the advisory said.Self-help groups make over 132 lakh masksNew Delhi: Self-helf groups from 24 states, under the Union Rural Development Ministry’s National Rural Livelihood Mission, have made over 132 lakh face masks.

But active job card holders are those who have been seeking work and coming to work under MGNREGA over the past two years.The petition contended that the March 24 lockdown order issued under the National Disaster Management Act, 2005 was binding on all ministries/instrumentalities of the Central and state governments and only essential services were exempt from it.As it required all citizens to follow social and physical distancing and didn’t exempt works performed under MGNREGA, it was not possible for MGNREGA card holders to work and earn livelihood, the petition submitted.It urged the top court to direct that “at least all active job card holders under MGNREGA over the past one year will be deemed to be on duty during the 21-day lockdown period and accordingly direct them to make payment of wages without deductions urgently.” The petition is likely to come up for hearing early next week.Describing MGNREGA as a programme meant to be a lifeline to rural workers during this kind of distress circumstances, the petitioners said, “It would be completely unfair to not enable MGNREGA to provide the support that it is designed to give when rural workers are facing the country’s worst challenge of unemployment and limited access to money and foodgrains.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-seeks-full-wages-for-7-6-cr-mgnrega-workers-65834

Published in the journal Antiviral Research, the study, conducted by senior scientists, stated drug Ivermectin stopped the virus from growing.Trials yet to be conducted on peoplePublished in the journal Antiviral Research, the study states the drug, Ivermectin, stops the virus from growing. “A single dose can essentially remove all viral RNA by 48 hours,” says study co-author Kylie Wagstaff from Monash University in Australia. He cautions that trials are yet to be conducted on people.“We found that even a single dose could essentially remove all viral RNA by 48 hours and that even at 24 hours there was a really significant reduction in it,” said study co-author Kylie Wagstaff from Monash University in Australia. The scientists said Ivermectin is an approved anti-parasitic drug that has also been shown to be effective in vitro against a broad range of viruses including HIV, Dengue, Influenza and Zika virus. However, Wagstaff cautioned that the tests conducted in the study were in vitro and that trials needed to be carried out on people.“Ivermectin is very widely used and seen as a safe drug. We need to figure out now whether the dosage you can use it at in humans will be effective - that’s the next step,” Wagstaff said. “In times when we’re having a global pandemic and there isn’t an approved treatment, if we had a compound that was already available around the world then that might help people sooner,” she said.Although the mechanism by which Ivermectin works on the virus is not known, the scientists said it is likely, based on its action in other viruses, that it works to stop the virus ‘dampening down’ the host cells’ ability to clear it. “As the virologist who was part of the team who were first to isolate and share SARS-COV2 outside of China in January 2020, I am excited about the prospect of Ivermectin being used as a potential drug against COVID-19,” said Leon Caly, study co-author from the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anti-parasitic-drug-kills-covid-study-65818

Also, most of the infected (41.88 per cent) are in the 21- 40 year age bracket.“In all, 1,023 positive cases in 17 states are linked to the Tablighi Jamaat event. This is over 30 per cent of all cases. Age profile analysis of Covid-19 cases shows 41.88 per cent infections among 21 to 40 year olds; 32.82 per cent in the 41 to 60 years group; 16.69 per cent in the above 60 years and 8.61 per cent in the below 20 year segment,” Health Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said, adding that cases in India were doubling at a much lesser rate than many countries but even one failure (read Nizamuddin) could push the government from the category of “success to non-success”.The government pointed out that during the 2009 H1N1 Influenza pandemic, well-connected big cities with large population movement had reported more cases than rural areas with poor connectivity. “The current Covid-19 geographic distribution mimics H1N1. While Covid-19 spread in our population could be high, it’s unlikely to uniformly affect all parts of the country. This warrants a differential approach to different regions while mounting strong containment in hot spots. Large-scale measures to contain Covid-19 over large territories have been tried in China,” the document notes.It says the Centre and states should review existing instruments that provide legal support to implement the containment plan — Disaster Management Act (2005); Epidemic Act (1897); CrPC and State Specific Public Health Act. It defines large outbreak as “localised increase in Covid-19 cases within a defined area — a village, town or city.”Containment plan envisages strict perimeter controlExport of diagnostic kits bannedNew Delhi: The government on Saturday restricted the export of diagnostic kits to case-by-case basis in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. “The export of diagnostic kits falling under any ITCHS Code (Indian Trade Clarification based on Harmonised System) is restricted with immediate effect,” said a notification issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade.
