WHO is now carrying out a major international study which will involve tests of three drug treatments, with both malaria and Ebola medicines involved, on patients from Norway and Spain.Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, a Norway-based organisation financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and a few governments, is talking to Serum Institute of India, one of world’s largest manufacturers of vaccine in the world.According to John-Arne Røttingen, chief of the highly respected Research Council of Norway, it will take at least three months for the trials to be completed and only then can a medicine be approved.“This is a big, international study including several countries that can include patients simultaneously so the world gets quick results. We don’t know how long that will take, maybe in two-three months we can get first results from the data, but that depends on the effect,’’ says Røttingen whose institute was part of a global coalition, including US and India, that produced the Rotavirus vaccine, that has helped reduce infant deaths and hospitalisations due to gastroenteritis.This coalition may be getting reactivated to start phase one clinical trial of an investigational vaccine.The French public-health research Center Inserm is sponsoring clinical trials on four drugs which will be extended to other nations, including India. Though the Chinese are receiving political flak for concealing the information about the spread of virus, scientists elsewhere are grateful for a Chinese laboratory making public the initial viral genome which enabled Covid tests to be conducted all over the world.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/public-spirit-drives-rd-on-covid-19-vaccine-64638

High time they think of national interest and stop misleading people,” said Shah.BJP president JP Nadda also criticised the Congress and said it must act more responsible at the time when the country is going through a crisis. “The Prime Minister is fighting this battle together with the state governments,” he said, asking the Congress to “function as a responsible political party”.“The Prime Minister is fighting this battle with all the State Governments as Team India. In difficult times, the Congress should function as a responsible political party. The statement made by Congress president Sonia Gandhi at a time like this is insensitive. This is the time to serve the country, not to do politics. We have to fight together,” said Nadda.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shah-nadda-hit-back-at-cong-accuse-it-of-playing-petty-politics-over-lockdown-64635

They can make these washable and reusable masks home” says Dr Shailja Vaidya Gupta, Senior Advisor, Office of the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government.The detailed manual on using and making homemade masks can be downloaded at http://bit.ly/DIYMasksCorona.The key for proposed designs are ease of access to materials, easy of making at home, ease of use and reuse, says the Department of Science and Technology. With the outbreak of COVID-19, shortage of face masks and hand sanitisers is a stark reality.While the anxious public frantically shops for hygiene products, in particularly the masks and hand sanitisers, the sudden increase of demand has met with a shortage of supply, it said. Shops and services are demanding that the customers use face masks.In some shops, the patrons are denied services for not using the face mask. Many health experts are also suggesting that the use of a face mask in public spaces could reduce the spread of infection. Wearing of masks is especially recommended for people living in densely populated areas.Notably, marking a major shift in strategy from existing rules on masks, government guidance on masks on Tuesday said once 80 per cent of the population wears masks outbreak of coronavirus can be stopped immediately. The hitherto in use Health Ministry advisory on masks followed the WHO guidance on the issue that “there is no scientific evidence to show health benefit of using masks for non-sick persons in the community."However, according to the manual “Masks for Curbing the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus” "analyses show if 50% of the population were to wear masks, only 50% of the population would be infected by the virus. Once 80% of the population wears a mask, the outbreak can be stopped immediately".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/make-masks-at-home-to-overcome-the-shortage-government-tells-how-64600

Because of the lockdown, women are not able to reach out to the police. They don't even want to go to the police because they are afraid that once their husband comes out of the police station, he will again torture her and she can't even move out.”“Earlier women could go to their parents place but now they are unable to reach.  The NCW is in touch with these complainants," she said.Women rights activists said they have also received numerous complaints of domestic violence from women since the enforcement of the lockdown.Rights activist Kavita Krishnan, also the secretary of the All India Progressive Women's Association, said vulnerable women could have moved to safer places if the government had given some warning of the lockdown."All the women (domestic violence victims) who contacted me said had they known (about the lockdown), they would have tried to get out earlier and be somewhere safer," she said."The only thing to do is help and rescue domestic violence survivors. Their situation is worse now in the lockdown," Krishnan added.According to Vani Subramanian, a member of the women's group Saheli Trust, "captivity anyway drives people crazy and abusive situations only make it worse".Ranjana Kumari, the director of the Centre for Social Research, said everyone was at home due to the lockdown and women were not getting the courage to contact for help.

He has urged for the streamlining of the movement of trucks.“Streaming the movement of trucks is the need of the hour to ensure a steady flow of supplies. Much like other industries, the animal feed industry has also been suffering a logjam in its supply chain even though it has been exempted from the lockdown.The logistics sector has come to a standstill which has impacted the supply chain of several sectors including the animal feed industry which has been categorised as an essential good and allowed free movement during the lockdown,” says Saraogi.According to Saraogi, this is leading to a ripple effect on the animal husbandry industry at large and broadening the demand-supply gap. It might eventually impact the food and nutrition security of the country, he warned.Saraogi says trucks were not operating due to lack of manpower and truckers were not being allowed to operate beyond state boundaries, despite government orders.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-forced-to-cull-animals-as-fodder-runs-out-say-industry-leaders-64596

02-04-2020||Vibha Sharma||Farmers can delay harvesting till April 20 as temperatures still below average: ICAR||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 2With temperatures in most of wheat-growing areas still below long-term average, the ICAR has said farmers can delay harvesting by at least 10-15 days beyond April 10.Farmers can delay wheat harvesting till April 20 without incurring any significant loss, says the advisory issued by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in the wake of the COVID-19 spread.The advisory includes precautions to farmers for harvesting and threshing of rabi crops, including wheat, and post-harvest, storage and marketing of farm produce. Harvesting and handling of the produce, including its movement to the market, are inevitable as the agricultural operations are time-bound. However, famers should take simple safety measures to prevent the disease spread, including social distancing, maintaining personal hygiene by washing of hands with soap, wearing of face mask, protective clothing and cleaning of implements and machinery. Workers should follow safety measures and social distancing at each and every step in the entire process of field operations, the ICAR said.The temperature in most of wheat-growing areas is still below long-term average and therefore likely to delay wheat harvesting by at least 10-15 days beyond April 10, therefore, farmers can delay wheat harvesting till April 20 without incurring any significant loss, which gives enough time to manage logistics for procurement and announcement of dates, it added.Rabi paddy in grain filling stage in southern states is widely affected due to neck blast incidence, so adequate precautions should be taken while spraying of recommended fungicide by contract sprayers/ farmers. In case of any unseasonal rain at harvesting stage in paddy, spray 5% salt solution to prevent seed germination, as per the ICAR.In case of manual field operations of harvesting/picking, the operation should be accomplished in 4-5 feet spaced strips assigning one strip to one person. This will ensure adequate spacing between the engaged labourers. All the persons engaged should use masks and ensure hand washing with soap at reasonable intervals and maintain safe distance of 3-4 feet during rest, taking of meals, transfer of produce at collection point, loading/unloading.Stagger the field operations wherever possible and avoid engaging more number of persons on the same day and  engage only familiar persons to the extent possible and after reasonable enquiry as to avoid the entry of any suspect or likely carrier during field activity.The ICAR said farmers should prefer mechanized operations over the manual wherever feasible and only the essential numbers of persons should be allowed to accompany the machine.All machines should be sanitized at the entry point and at regular intervals as also all transport vehicles, gunny bags or other packaging material.The collection of the produce may be done in small heaps spaced at 3-4 feet and field level processing should be assigned to 1-2 persons/heap to avoid crowding, it said.Proper sanitation and cleanliness of threshers for harvested maize and groundnut is to be maintained, especially when machines are shared and used by farmer groups. Copious washing of machine parts frequently touched with soap is advised. For performing drying, threshing, winnowing, cleaning, grading, sorting and packaging operations at the farm level, wearing of protective face masks may help against aerosols and dust particles to prevent respiratory difficulties.The advisory calls for ensuring proper drying prior to storage of harvested grains, millets, pulses at farm/home.Do not reuse previous seasons’ jute bags to prevent pest infestation, use treated and dried gunnies after soaking in 5% neem solution, it says.Adequate precautions should be taken for storage of produce at the farm in jute bags that are made available in sufficient numbers to farmers or in nearby cold storages/ godowns/warehouses, if needed for better price realization.It also advised adequate personal safety measures for loading and transporting of farm produce and while participating in sale at market yards/auction platforms.Agricultural and allied activities exempted from lockdownVeterinary hospitalsAgencies engaged in procurement of agriculture products, including MSP operations‘Mandis’ operated by the Agriculture Produce Market Committee as notified by the State GovernmentFarming operations by farmers and farm workers in the fieldCustom hiring centres (CHC) related to farm machineryManufacturing and packaging units of Fertilizers, Pesticides and SeedsIntra and inter-state movement of harvesting and sowing related machines like combined harvester and other agriculture/ horticulture implements||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-can-delay-harvesting-till-april-20-as-temperatures-still-below-average-icar-64566

When he learnt that the police were looking for him, he fled from his house and, later, his body was found hanging on the village outskirts.The police added the body has been sent for autopsy, and district administration would provide compensation to the bereaved family.Mitauli SDM Digvijay Singh said that, “The victim was quarantined following the government’s directions. We even informed him that isolation is a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of his family members and neighbours. The victim had fled from the camp to meet his family. When police reached the village searching for him, he escaped and was later found hanging.”Maigalganj police station SHO Chandrakant Singh said, “It appears that the victim took the extreme step as he started panicking at the quarantine centre despite repeated attempts by officials to make him understand that it was just a precautionary measure. Authorities have provided proper food and other necessary facilities at the centre. We are investigating the matter and a case will be registered based on the findings.” This is the fifth Corona related suicide in Uttar Pradesh.On Tuesday, a farmer, who was suffering from fever and cold, committed suicide to ‘save his entire village from being infected with Corona virus’. The incident took place in Mathura.Earlier on March 24, a young man who had been suffering from fever and cough, committed suicide in Kanpur by hanging himself because he feared he was suffering from Corona virus.Last month, in two separate incidents, two youths had committed suicide in Hapur and Bareilly because they also believed that they were suffering from the deadly virus. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-escapes-quarantine-commits-suicide-in-up-64563

02-04-2020||---||Post Tablighi event, Nadda slams those ‘weakening’ anti-Covid fight||New Delhi, April 1With BJP president JP Nadda slamming those “weakening” India’s fight against Covid-19, politics over Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Nizammuddin — which has emerged as the hotspot of the deadly virus — has just begun. Speaking to party leaders in Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Chhattisgarh via video-conferencing, Nadda said while the entire country was showing immense courage, perseverance and restraint in facing the challenge, “some people are taking the fight against coronavirus lightly and not following the lockdown guidelines. This is weakening our fight against the virus.”The BJP president did not name anyone or a particular event, but it was clear what and who he was referring to in the video-conference while taking account of the party’s corona relief work in different parts of the country.With the Left training guns at the BJP for “propagating the narrative of criminalisation and communalisation of the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Nizammuddin” and several BJP leaders retaliating against it, the political slugfest is expected to get fiercer in days to come.Party’s IT cell chief Amit Malviya said, "The last three months have seen an Islamic insurrection of sorts in Delhi, first in the name of anti-CAA protests from Shaheen Bagh to Jamia and Jaffrabad to Seelampur, and now the illegal gathering of the radical Tablighi Jamaat."Spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said all those at the gathering should have taken PM Narendra Modi’s advice seriously. Union Minister for Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi called the incident nothing short of a Taliban crime. Yesterday, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tewari alleged a “big conspiracy.”538 Tablighi jamaat attendees being screened in RajasthanJaipur: DGP Bhupendra Singh on Wednesday said 538 people, including five Nepal citizens, who returned after attending Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi recently, were being searched, screened and quarantined.

02-04-2020||New Delhi||Indian researchers develop coating that kills Covid||Amid all the pessimism and anxiety, there appears to be a ray of sunshine with the government today saying the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) has developed a one-step curable anti-microbial coating which, when coated on different surfaces like textile and plastic, could kill a range of virus types, including the deadly Covid-19.Surfaces to be contamination-freeResearchers believe that a one-step curable anti-microbial coating may inactivate SARS-CoV-2 upon contact and can help prevent contamination if coated on various surfaces like textile and plastic.JNCASR is an autonomous institution under the Department of Science and Technology. According to the researchers, “till date, to the best of our knowledge, there is no covalent coating strategy which can kill all viruses, bacteria and fungi.”The covalent coating, the research paper about which has been accepted in the journal Applied Material and Interfaces, has been found to completely kill influenza virus as well as resistant pathogenic bacteria and fungi, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and fluconazole-resistant C. albicans, as per the department.Coronavirus, like influenza, is also an enveloped virus. Therefore, it is anticipated that the coating may inactivate SARS-CoV-2 upon contact and can help prevent contamination if coated on various surfaces, it added.Considering the current outbreak, if shown to be active, the molecule can be synthesised in large scale through a CRO (Contract Research Organisation) and can be coated on various personal protective tools such as masks, gloves and gowns in collaboration with the private organisations. The molecules can also be coated on other medical devices and tools to avoid hospital-acquired or nosocomial infections. Notably, the frontline health workers are at the biggest risk currently.The coating can be fabricated on a variety of surfaces, and its ease and robustness eliminate the necessity of skilled personnel for procurement of the coating, they saidThe molecules developed have an ability to chemically cross-link with different surfaces upon UV irradiation. Upon the formation of the coating, it has been shown to permeabilize the membranes of pathogens (i.e. bacteria) leading to their inactivation.Microbial attachment and their colony formation on different surfaces play a major role in the transmission of deadly infections in the community as well as healthcare settings. Keeping this in mind, an easy approach was developed to coat a wide range of substrates used in daily life as well as in clinical settings. Molecules were designed, keeping in mind their optimum solubility in a wide range of solvents (such as water, ethanol, chloroform).The molecules were then immobilised on different substrates such as cotton, polyurethane, polypropylene, polystyrene, etc., which construct majority of the objects we see around us. After coating, the surfaces were evaluated for their antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity, said the department.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-researchers-develop-coating-that-kills-covid-64274

While talking to The Tribune, they said they were not being allowed to move ahead by the police and had no idea when they would enter UP and reach their homes. “I think we have committed a mistake, we should not have come from Jalandhar. We are thinking of going back, but have no energy left,” Chander said, fearing that they might end up spending the next 14 days at the petrol station.They left Jalandhar because they feared hunger after they were left without work due to the lockdown. For the last 20 years, both Chander and Prakash have been doing small jobs like repairing folding beds in Jalandhar. For the first time in two decades, they said they felt like leaving the city. Fearing that there would be no work for the next few months, they took the tough call to move to their villages.Girish Chander, who belongs to Kannauj district, said the pandemic had come as a nightmare for them as they were not only without work but also had no place where they could live peacefully. Somen Prakash from Farrukhabad district lamented: “Kya karte ab yahan reh kar. Paise khatam hote jaa rahe the. Dar lag raha tha, socha vaapis chale jaaye (What we will do in Jalandhar now. We were running out of money. We were scared, so thought of moving back).”Talking about their long and arduous journey, they said, “We were halting at intervals to take rest. It was not easy to ride with the belongings and pillion riders. Now, we only want to reach home.”Echoing the wish, Girish’s wife Mamta said they had no shortage of food during the journey, but their only desire remained to reach home. “Now we cannot even go back, it is not possible. The only way out is to reach home and start a new life there,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stuck-at-up-border-after-3-days-of-pedalling-64272
