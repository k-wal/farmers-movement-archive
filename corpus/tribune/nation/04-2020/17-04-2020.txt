On one hand the government want the continuity of essential supplies and which our fraternity is doing against all odds and at even loss, in service of the nation,” it said.AIMTC represents about 95 lakh truckers and transport entities.Its president Kultaran Singh Atwal said: “The entire transport fraternity is financially broke and does not have finance for operations and bringing back drivers either, which is another big challenge. Yet the government instead of extending this sector a helping hand by giving a bare minimum rescue package, submitted by AIMTC, it is burdening it with toll charges that account for 20 per cent of the operating costs.”      Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training (IFTRT) Coordinator SP Singh in the past 21 days the benefit of toll fee not being levied was hardly being passed on in form of any reduction in truck rentals across the country.“In view of COVID-19, it has been ordered to temporarily suspend the collection of toll at all toll plazas across India,” Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari has announced on March 25.This will not only reduce inconvenience to emergency services but also save critical time, he has said.The minister has said maintenance of roads and availability of emergency resources at toll plazas will continue as usual.Earlier, the Road Transport and Highways Ministry had advised the NHAI to follow the Home Ministry’s guidelines about toll plaza operations following the lockdown.The prevailing condition may be treated as “Force Majeure” of concession or contract agreement in terms of the Finance Ministry, it had said.The NHAI had rolled out the electronic toll collection programme across India in December on its over 500 toll plazas while doubling toll charges from the vehicles entering FASTag lanes without the tag.

Accordingly, necessary measures may be taken in this regard on priority,” sources said quoting the letter.According to data available with the MHA there are about 40,000 Rohingya refugees, who are living in different parts of India, including in Delhi, Jammu and Hyderabad.Last month, eight Rohingya Muslims, who have been living in Jammu, were put in quarantine after they attended the Nizamuddin meet.Over 2,300 activists, including 250 foreigners of Tablighi Jamaat, were found to be living at the organisation’s headquarters, or ‘markaz’, located at Delhi’s Nizamuddin last month despite the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus. At least 9,000 people took part in the congregation at the Nizamuddin Markaz last month after which many travelled to various parts of the country for missionary works.The MHA had earlier said about 2,100 foreigners have come to India since January 1 and participated in Tablighi activities all across the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mha-asks-states-uts-to-probe-rohingyas-link-with-tablighi-72544

Since the structure of coronavirus is similar to that of HIV to some extent, so they tried a combination of the two anti-HIV drugs,” Gehlot claimed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-launches-rapid-testing-kit-for-covid-19-tests-72541

They broke down the door that was bolted from inside and found his body hanging from the ceiling fan on Thursday evening,” Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police, Noida, Ranvijay Singh said.“During inquiry it came to light that he would make videos on TikTok and nobody was ‘liking’ his videos on the app since past few days. It’s a shocking finding... People from his family and neighbourhood said that he was really worried over not getting ‘likes’ on TikTok and that is why he took this extreme step,” the officer said.The ADCP said no suicide note was found from the spot but the teenager had told his family members and neighbours that he was “depressed” because he was not getting the expected response on the social media app.“However, we are investigating the matter and proceedings will be carried out depending on the findings in the case,” Singh said.A popular social media app now, India is one of the most significant markets for TikTok.

But they have been stuck due to the ongoing lockdown,” the official said, adding that the force on April 7 asked them to stay wherever they are till the lockdown period comes to an end.“We have to contain the spread of this deadly coronavirus and we cannot afford to have our men fall sick because of it as this may impact their border guarding duty, which is now at its peak,” he said.BSF is extending sanitisation facilities and makes the farmers aware of the COVID-19 protocol. The force is also getting lockdown guidelines implemented in the border areas in Laddakh, J&K, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Eastern frontiers.The farmers are busy in harvesting wheat and other Rabi crops. So at this juncture any contamination spreading from suspicious parcels will badly affect the population at the borders and this may lead to further complications to border-side villages and towns, says another official.The force has undertaken massive mobilisation of logistics and sanitisation equipment, including digital thermometers, plastic tanks filled with hand-wash sanitisers at various fence gates so that the farmers and farm labourers can use them while entering and leaving the fields.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/strictly-adhere-to-covid-19-protocol-in-dealing-with-objects-lobbed-from-other-side-bsf-72526

Our priority is to help them earn their livelihood,” the official said.Under the plan prepared by the Maharashtra government, the workers will be tested for fever and other symptoms of Covid-19 and then moved to the industrial estates where they would be expected to maintain social distancing. Their employers are expected to provide them with food and accommodation so that the workers do not move out of the premises, according to the official.Several large industrial units in Maharashtra have sought the government’s permission to restart operations.Of the 36 districts in Maharashtra there are no coronavirus cases in six of them.

In the last 25 days, the commission received 239 more such complaints.NCW Chairperson Rekha Sharma earlier said that the high number can be attributed to the lockdown imposed due to the coronavirus outbreak, which has locked the abuser and the victim together.The nationwide lockdown was declared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 to control the spread of coronavirus.From February 27 to March 22, a total of 396 offences related to women were reported to the NCW, while from March 23 to April 16, as many as 587 such complaints were received, according to the data.The highest number of complaints was related to domestic violence.

I am Babita Phogat and I have and will continue to fight for my country," said Phogat.She goes on to say that there is nothing wrong about what she had tweeted and that she still stands by it. "If the Tablighi Jamaat people hadn't spread coronavirus, the lockdown would have been lifted by now and we would have defeated the virus already," she further added.यदि आप बबीता फोगाट को सपोर्ट करते हैं तो उन तक यह बात जरूर पहुंचा दीजिए और उनको बोलिए ध्यान से कान खोल कर सुन लें। pic.twitter.com/gqec3lQwPE  Phogat ends the video by saying that she has always believed in speaking the truth and will continue to do so.#SuspendBabitaPhogat trended on the Twitter site this morning as many users criticised her remarks.

17-04-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus: Lockdown has slowed rate of spread, says Health Ministry||The Union Health Ministry said on Friday that the rate of rise in infections appeared to be slowing, a statement that came even as the country reported 1,007 more infections with 23 new deaths in 24 hours.The ministry said in its daily press briefing that the rate at which the number of coronavirus cases in the country was becoming double in the last one week was 6.2 days, as against three days before the nationwide lockdown was imposed.Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry Lav Agarwal claimed that India has been doing better than many other countries on the outcome ratio, which is the number of recoveries from coronavirus infection versus the number of deaths.“If 80 per cent of the patients in India are recovering and in 20 per cent cases deaths are being reported, then by that standard India has been doing a little better than many other nations on the outcome ratio,” he said.“Before lockdown, the doubling rate of coronavirus cases was 3 days. Going by the number of cases in the last seven days, the doubling rate has been 6.2 days. In 19 states and Union Territories the doubling rate is less than the national average,” he said.The health ministry official also said the average growth factor of cases from April 1 has been 1.2, whereas between March 15 and 31 it was 2.1.This decline of 40 per cent was due to increase in testing, including that of cases with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI), Agarwal said.He also informed reporters that 1,919 dedicated COVID-19 hospitals with 1.73 lakh isolation beds and 21,800 ICU beds have been readied till now.The number of novel coronavirus cases in India rose by 1,007 and 23 deaths were reported in 24 hours, taking the tally of total infections to 13,387 and fatalities to 437, the joint secretary in the health ministry said, adding 1,749 people have been cured of the infection so far, which is 13.06 per cent of the total patients.Agarwal further informed that five lakh rapid antibody testing kits, which arrived from China on Thursday, are being distributed to states for districts with high case burden.Head of Epidemiology and Communicable diseases at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar said 3,19,400 COVID-19 tests have been conducted so far in the country.“Out of these, 28,340 tests were conducted on Thursday, of which 23,932 were done at 183 laboratories under ICMR network and the rest at 80 private labs,” he said.Agarwal said a Group of Ministers held a meeting on Friday to chalk out a roadmap about the lockdown and reviewed efforts of science and technology institutes in diagnosis, vaccines, drugs, hospital equipment accessories and general wellness.The country’s coronavirus count currently stands at 13,835 with 452 deaths, the health ministry’s website shows.‘Scaling back’The ministry had said earlier that it would scale down containment operations if no secondary coronavirus was reported from a quarantine zone for at least four weeks after the last confirmed test has been isolated and all his contacts have been followed up for 28 days. According to the ministry's ‘Updated containment plan for large outbreaks COVID-19’, a containment operation (large outbreak or cluster) is deemed to be over 28 days from the date the last case in that zone tests negative.The closing of the surveillance for the clusters could be independent of one another provided there is no geographic continuity between clusters. However the surveillance will continue for severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI). States shall ensure that all required steps are taken to contain clusters within the large outbreak and chain of transmission is broken, it said.The document stated that in India also, clusters and large outbreaks have been noted in parts of the country and unless they are contained in time, the risk of further spread remains very high. Large number of cases has been reported from Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.The Centre has declared 170 hotspots ---123 hotspot districts with large outbreaks and 47 hotspot districts with clusters. Besides, it has identified 207 non-hotspot districts with clusters.In a bid to utilise the extended lockdown period to the maximum extent to contain the spread of coronavirus, states have been asked by the ministry to classify districts witnessing higher number of cases or high growth rate as hotspots, districts where some cases have been found as non-hotspots, and those which have reported no cases as green zones.According to the Health Ministry's document, "containment for large outbreaks through geographic quarantine strategy calls for near absolute interruption of movement of people to and from a relatively large defined area where there is single large outbreak or multiple foci of local transmission" of COVID-19.In simple terms, it is a barrier erected around the focus of infection. Geographic quarantine shall be applicable to such areas reporting large outbreak and/or multiple clusters of COVID-19 spread over multiple blocks of one or more districts that are contiguous based on the distribution of cases and contacts.According to the plan, the authorities will do extensive contact tracing and active search for cases in containment zone, test all suspect cases and high-risk contacts, isolate all suspect or confirmed cases, implement social distancing measures and intensive risk communication as part of the cluster containment strategy. For large outbreaks amenable to containment, the documents stated that the strategy will remain the same but vary in extent depending upon spread and response to be mounted to contain it. Geographic quarantine and containment strategy will include defining the area of operation, active surveillance for cases and contacts in the identified geographic zone, expanding laboratory capacity for testing all suspect cases, high risk contacts and SARI cases and operationalising surge capacities created for isolation (COVID-19 hospitals/blocks) to hospitalise and manage all suspect or confirmed cases. It will also include implementation of social distancing measures with strict perimeter control, providing chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine to all asymptomatic healthcare workers and asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases and further intensification of risk communication through audio, social and visual media. "The objective of this containment plan is to stop the chain of transmission thus reducing the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19," the ministry said. ---- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-lockdown-has-slowed-rate-of-spread-says-health-ministry-72508

However, allegations and speculations are that after toppling the Kamal Nath government with the help of 22 of his men, and that too right amid the corona crisis, the main reason why there is still no council of ministers to assist Chouhan is because the saffron party is not clear about who to accommodate and who to leave out.Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh continues to see a serious surge in coronavirus cases, especially in Indore and Bhopal, emerging quite near the top in the dubious list of COVID-19 infections and deaths. While BJP leaders are blaming Kamal Nath for "not doing anything on the front" while he was trying to save his government, the former Congress CM has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of delaying the nationwide lockdown only to topple him.In mid-March, while the states geared up to battle corona, Madhya Pradesh was engaged in politics of the highest order. Interestingly, Modi announced the 21-day lockdown a day after Chouhan took oath on March 23, this even though earlier he said the Parliament session would not be curtailed come what may.A state not having a health minister at such a time is unheard of, and earlier there were speculations that some ministers could be appointed around April 15 but it seems the BJP has not been able to settle the dynamics of the Cabinet.However, the question remains if Chouhan could be sworn in, why couldn’t his Cabinet?Local sources claim members of the task force is an indication of the future shape of the Shivraj cabinet.Efforts have been made to give region-wise representation in the task force where apart from Chouhan and state BJP president VD Sharma, state BJP general secretary (organisation) Suhas Bhagat, national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, former BJP state president and Jabalpur MP Rakesh Singh, six MLAs and a former Congress MLA are part.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-difficult-times-of-coronavirus-mp-govt-working-without-ministers-72467

They will be kept in quarantine, so that hospital beds are free for seriously ill patients,” said Pardeshi.Reports in the local media have been highlighting how patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms are running for one hospital to another in the absence of sufficient beds.Civic officials say asymptomatic patients would be moved out of hospitals over the next few days.The MC has also decided not to conduct Covid tests on high-risk contacts of those who have tested positive unless they show symptoms.“We have stopped collecting swabs of people who do not show symptoms,” a health department official said. Sources say the testing facilities of the state government and the MC are overburdened and results are taking several days to be delivered.The civic body’s decision to test only those people showing symptoms has come in for criticism from opposition parties. “The MC is regularly doing flip flops regarding testing. Every few days there is a circular by the civic body on who is to be tested,” Samajwadi Party councillor from Mumbai Raees Shaikh said.In a letter to the authorities, Shaikh said the MC should aggressively test people and treat those who test positive.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/asymptomatic-patients-shunted-out-as-hospitals-run-out-of-beds-72224

While we are testing 24 people to get one positive case, Japan is testing 11.5, Italy 6.7, the US 5.3 and the UK 3.4. The test criteria we are following are the same that are followed by other countries. It is not correct to assume that we are offering the tests to lesser number of people,” ICMR chief epidemiologist Raman Gangakhedkar said as the country’s Covid case load soared to 12,759 and death toll mounted to 420 on Thursday with an additional 1,320 cases and 43 deaths over a single day.Testing Ratio Better Than In US, Japan, UKWe are testing 24 people to get one positive case.

It is not correct to assume that we are offering the tests to lesser number of people.Raman Gangakhedkar, ICMR OfficialSo far 1,514 people have recovered showing a cure rate of around 12 per cent as against a case fatality rate of 3.3 per cent. The government today assured that the ICMR had enough testing stocks for eight weeks and more testing kits were on the way. The ICMR has in the past 10 days ramped up testing significantly with 2,90,401 total samples tested so far and 26,331 tested yesterday.“Due to advance efforts, we have managed to contain the infection to some measure. Our field actions have ensured that many districts that were previously reporting cases are now free of new cases. There are 325 districts with no Covid case. Mahe in Puducherry has not seen any new case for 28 days and 27 districts in 17 states have been free of new infection for 14 days now,” Health Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said.Among these 27 districts are Punjab’s SBS Nagar, Haryana’s Panipat, J&K’s Rajouri and Uttarakhand’s Pauri Garhwal. On the testing front, the ICMR today said if its 176 labs worked on a daily shift of eight hours, they could test as many as 42,418 samples a day and with double shift of eight hours each, this capacity could be augmented to 78,227 daily. In another important development today, India received five lakh rapid antibody test kits from two Chinese firms – Wondfo and Livzhon.The ICMR however clarified today that these kits are not meant for diagnosis and testing of Covid as these only detect antibodies to the virus. “These kits are meant only for surveillance of trends in disease hotspots and will help us find out if the infection is rising or decreasing. These rapid test kits for antibody tests are not meant for early diagnosis of the disease,” Gangakhedkar said, adding that the errors in the performance of the kits, as have been seen in some tests, would not matter because the kits are not being used to test people. “In the longer term over which we will use the antibody kits, errors will not hold,” the ICMR clarified.India is currently testing the following people for Covid: symptomatic recent travellers to Covid-affected nations; symptomatic contacts of lab confirmed cases; symptomatic health workers; all severe pneumonia and influenza-like cases in designated hotspots; and asymptomatic high-risk cases at the fifth and 14th day of history of contact to a confirmed case.Genome sequence establishedGandhinagar: The Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre claims to have established the entire genome sequence of coronavirus.

The issue of mobilising resources and the framework of the package were discussed at a meeting here today between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, said sources.This will be the second Covid relief package. It is expected to focus on small and medium industry that have been hit in quick succession by demonetisation, GST and now the pandemic. The IMF and the World Bank have both pegged India’s GDP growth at rock bottom levels during the current fiscal which translates into a recession.The government had earlier announced and largely disbursed a Rs 1.7 lakh crore relief package for the economically challenged that includes direct cash transfers to the poor and free ration. It has also been announcing relaxations in mandatory compliances for businesses and individuals.Sources said the PM and FM discussed the vital issue of resource mobilisation against the backdrop of revenue projection figures, including GST and direct tax collections, having gone haywire due to slow growth followed by Covid-induced lockdown.According to indications, the stimulus will follow the course of government’s pre-Covid effort to revive growth by announcing initiatives in stages. Besides the micro, small and medium enterprise (MSMEs) segments, the country’s largest employment generator and which has been worst hit by the lockdown, the government may look at cash transfers for some service sectors, especially hospitality and tourism.
