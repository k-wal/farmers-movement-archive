Opposing any unilateral action by India in J&K, he said China wanted a peaceful resolution of issue according to UN charter and resolutions.The spokesperson also reiterated that China’s stance on the Kashmir remains unchanged, calling it a dispute left from history.In response, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said China is well aware of India’s “consistent position” on this issue. “The UT of J&K has been, is and shall continue to be an integral part of India. Issues related to J&K are internal matter to India,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-slams-china-over-comments-on-j-k-68908

His father Lt Col KS Bal (retd) from the Garhwal Rifles, hails from Amritsar and is now based in Gurugram.The Army has left it to the family to decide the location of his cremation. Permission has come to fly-out the parents of the deceased in a military plane or to bring the mortal remains to the place of family’s choice. Civilian flights are suspended.Colonel Bal, is survived by his wife Aarti, who is also his school time friend from Army Public School, Dhaula Kuan, Delhi Cantonment, and his two sons -- Zorawar and Sarbaaz, aged 8 years and 4 years.Many years ago in 2008, while operating in Lolab valley in J&K, Col Bal had earned the Shaurya Chakra, the third highest peacetime gallantry award.Sometime in the middle of 2018 Colonel Bal had observed a slight swelling in his right arm after doing chin-ups. It was thought to be an exertion-related swelling. A radiological evaluation was done followed by a biopsy and MRI which revealed that he suffered from a rare type of cancer called ‘Telangiectactic osteosarcoma’.Several medical consultations followed in US and also at the Tata cancer research, finally, in March 2019, it was decided that his right arm had to be amputated.Doctors at the Army’s Research and Referral Hospital at Delhi did the amputation to prevent the cancer from spreading into his body. One of his ‘Para’ mates recollected that May 2019, after the amputation, Col Bal was leading his men into an exercise at Rajasthan. “I was surprised to see Bal arriving at the exercise,” recalled his senior mate.Later, given his medical condition Col Bal was asked to relieve himself of command of the elite 2 Para SF and was attached to the Para training school at Bangalore which allowed him to also get treated.Unfortunately, it turned out to be an aggressive cancer was spreading in his body soon his lungs, liver and heart were impacted.Once after having diagnosed of cancer, he ran a half marathon (21 km), recalled an Army doctor.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gallantry-awardee-colonel-loses%C2%A0battle-to-cancer-68890

This was also the day when Trump called up Modi and later revealed that he had sought a reversal of this notification. Two days later Trump said that though he expected Modi to allow HCQ exports to the US, there could be retaliation if New Delhi did otherwise.That spell of acrimony ended when Trump put up an effusive and pleasant front by thanking Modi, India and the Indian people for the decision on HCQ. “Extraordinary times require even closer cooperation between friends. Thank you India and Indian people for decision on HCQ. Will not be forgotten! Thank you PM Modi for your strong leadership in helping not just India, but humanity, in this fight!: US Pres Donald Trump,’’ tweeted Trump.Modi responded by agreeing with Trump that “times like these bring friends closer”. The India-US partnership, he added, is stronger than ever and “India shall do everything possible to help humanity’s fight against COVID-19. We shall win this together’’.The exchanges by the two most followed leaders on social media sent Twitter in a tizzy. Modi’s tweet collected 1.35 lakh likes and around 27,000 retweets while Trump’s tweet broke the counter and was last heading for the four lakh “likes” mark and breaking the one lakh retweet mark.“India’s supplies of medicines, especially HCQ and paracetamol to several countries, including the  US, Israel, Gulf, neighbours, etc confirm our role as first provider and help in global fight against Covid,” noted Sanjay Bhattacharya, Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs.HCQ was an also-ran in the Indian pharmaceutical growth story, accounting for less than 3 per cent of total exports. Its fate turned after Trump said it was a miracle cure following which India prohibited its export on March 25 and tightening the domestic retail distribution rules the next day. But what specifically raised American ire was the April 4 notification that banned even pre-contracted shipments of HCQ.India has also relented in the case of paracetamol as well; it had banned this antibiotic on March 3, but cleared it for case-by-case exports on April 6, the day External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a conversation.HCQ has now become the drug most in demand for to battle Covid, evident from Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro making the announcement in his address to the nation. “As an outcome of my direct conversation with PM of India, we will receive, by Saturday, raw materials to continue production of HCQ so we can treat patients of COVID-19 as well as of lupus, malaria, and arthritis. I thank PM Modi and the people of India for such timely help to the people of Brazil,” said Bolsonaro who like Trump is fighting with his back to the wall after having delayed a response.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-trump-close-brief-chapter-of-acrimony-over-covid-drug-68888

09-04-2020||New Delhi||In poll-bound Bengal, BJP questions TMC govt data on coronavirus||After engaging over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “light a candle” appeal, another tussle has erupted between the BJP and the Mamata Banerjee government over the number of COVID-19 cases in West Bengal.When asked for an update on Tablighi cases, Mamata Banerjee had said: “Don’t ask communal questions.”“Jamaat cases have exploded across, but no clarity on the latest numbers in Bengal. How many of them traced and tested. Results? No update at all! Has she made this about vote bank,” said BJP’s IT cell in-charge Amit Malviya, taking on Banerjee.On Wednesday she had announced that eight more people tested positive, taking the number of cases to 87 in the state.However, as per the Union Health Ministry, the figure was higher in the poll-bound state, where a relatively low tally as compared to other large states has been attributed to “the State government’s timely intervention”. But the Opposition, mainly the BJP, is questioning the veracity of the figures.On Wednesday, when asked to share an update about those who attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi, which has been held responsible for nearly 30 per cent of the cases in India, Banerjee was quoted as saying “Do not ask such communal questions. This is Bengal and we are a very secular state”.Incidentally, this is not the first time the BJP and the TMC have been at loggerheads. Criticising bursting of crackers during the Prime Minister’s ‘lights-out’ call, TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee said: “with the firecrackers, fancy diyas & sky lanterns, we have become the first-ever Nation to celebrate a pandemic”. State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said it was an “expression of happiness” amid the nationwide lock-down.“I want to ask the environmentalists who said that the air quality deteriorated. What about the entire year when the pollution is at its peak? I would request everybody not to make an issue out of this incident,” Ghosh said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-poll-bound-bengal-bjp-questions-tmc-govt-data-on-coronavirus-68844

09-04-2020||Washington||PM Modi was 'terrific' in allowing export of hydroxychloroquine to US: Trump||President Donald Trump has thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his decision to allow the export of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which could be used in the possible treatment of thousands of coronavirus patients in the US.Trump, during a phone call last week, asked Prime Minister Modi to lift the hold on American order of the anti-malarial drug, of which India is the major producer. India lifted the hold on Tuesday.India agreed to lift the ban on export of hydroxychloroquine to the US. Three Gujarat-based companies would export these tablets to the US, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said on Tuesday."I want to thank Prime Minister Modi of India for allowing us to have what we requested for the problem arose and he was terrific. We will remember it,” Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on coronavirus on Wednesday.In a tweet, hours earlier, Trump praised Modi for his strong leadership and said that India's help during this crisis would not be forgotten.“Extraordinary times require even closer cooperation between friends. Thank you India and the Indian people for the decision on HCQ. Will not be forgotten!” he said.Fully agree with you President @realDonaldTrump. Times like these bring friends closer.

Scientists and the medical fraternity are racing against time to find a vaccine and a therapeutic solution to it.Hydroxychloroquine has been identified by the US Food and Drug Administration as a possible treatment for the COVID-19 and it is being tested on more than 1,500 coronavirus patients in New York. Anticipating that it will work, given initial positive results, Trump has bought more than 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine for potential treatment of COVID-19 patients.India manufactures 70 per cent of the world's supply of hydroxychloroquine, according to Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) secretary-general Sudarshan Jain.The country has a production capacity of 40 tonnes of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) every month, implying 20 crore tablets of 200 mg each. And since the drug is also used to auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, manufacturers have good production capacities that can also be ramped up.Indian Americans have welcomed the decision.“President Trump is graceful and grateful. He is honest when he says that he will not forget India's gesture. He is a True Friend of India,” said Al Mason, a Trump supporter.“Thank you President! I think you are well orchestrating the compulsion of history and demand of destiny that we and India be the best of friends, joined at the hip and yet as family, free hearts and minds to love across a spectrum of emotions, but always together,” tweeted Indian-American attorney Ravi Batra.

In an advisory titled ‘Addressing social stigma on Covid-19,’ the Health Ministry listed a series of don’ts saying, “Never spread names or identity those affected or under quarantine or their locality on the social media; avoid spreading fear and panic; do not not target healthcare and sanitary workers or police; do not label any community or area for the spread of Covid-19; avoid addressing those under treatment as Covid victims and address them as people recovering from Covid.” The advisory also asks people to not target essential services providers and their families adding “this will weaken the fight and can prove grievously detrimental for the entire nation.” The government for its part has routinely named “Tablighi Jamaat workers and their contacts” as contributors to national case burden to the extent of around 30 per cent and more. The advisory came in the wake of cases of discrimination and assault on health and sanitary workers besides policemen, who are in the frontline for management of the outbreak. The advisory added, “Even those who have recovered from Covid-19 face such discrimination. Further, certain communities and areas are being labeled purely based on false reports floating on social media and elsewhere. There is an urgent need to counter such prejudices and to rise as a community that is empowered with health literacy and responds appropriately in the face of this adversity.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-label-people-or-areas-affected-by-virus-says-government-68570
09-04-2020||Ajay Banerjee---||It''s musical chairs for top Army medical post||Tribune News Service New Delhi, April 8 In the past 34 months, the post of Director General Medical Services (Army) —  the senior most doctor responsible for the health and well being the 13 lakh Indian Army — has shifted between officers like a game of ‘musical chairs’. The other two services —  the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy —  also have similar posts for their services. The three also have a boss, DG, Armed Forces Medical Service (DGAFMS). Since July 2017, there have been eight Lieutenant General rank doctors, who have been appointed at the post of DGMS Army. The latest one Lt Gen AK Hooda who took over on April 2, became the third incumbent in past 10 months, since June 1, 2019. His predecessor Lt Gen RS Grewal started his tenure on November 1, 2019 and handed over the charge five months later. Lt Gen A Banerji started his tenure on June 1, 2019 and got promoted as DGAFMS in October. During 2017-2018, for period of nine months the post even had an ‘Officiating’ DGMS Army. Sources said a proposal to have fixed tenure for a minimum of one year as DG is awaiting clearance from the Principal Personnel Officers Committee (PPOC), a body of the three armed forces. A senior functionary said the problem is due to a policy which says an officer can be in the rank of Lt General (or equivalent in the IAF and the Navy) for only two years of his career or till attaining the retirement age of 61.  A doctor in the rank of Lt General works on other posts before becoming the DG. By the time the turn comes, only for a few months of his two-year tenure remain. A way out of this situation is to retire doctors at 61 years of age instead of sending them home after being Lt Gen for two years. Meanwhile, the Armed Forces Tribunal directed that the seniority principle be followed to appoint the DGMS. The concept of having a fixed tenure was not considered and the Army then got down to following the AFT directions while the policy-framing to amend the anomaly is pending with the PPOC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/its-musical-chairs-for-top-army-medical-post-68564

Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?” the President repeated the accusations against the UN health organisation at a White House press briefing.“They called it wrong.

It is a very small amount as far as government spending is concerned, but it's a huge amount for the newspaper industry, which is essential for any vibrant democracy, and is struggling to survive’’, INS president Shailesh Gupta said in a statement.Print media is the only industry which has a wage board and the government decides how much the employees should be paid. This being the only industry where market forces do not decide salaries, the government has a responsibility towards the industry. Further, in the age of fake news and distortion, it is the best platform — for both the government and the Opposition — to get news and views directly across to the people in every nook and corner of the country, he said.Pointing out there was already a decline in advertisement and circulation revenue due to recession and the digital onslaught, he said: “We now face severe financial crisis due to the complete lockdown of industries and business. At a time like this when media personnel are risking their lives and bringing news on the pandemic situation, the suggestion of the Congress president for a two-year ban on media advertisements is deeply disturbing and demotivating for the entire media industry’’, he said.The INS appealed to the chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party to reconsider and withdraw the suggestion made to the PM in the interest of a “vibrant and free Press”.Defending the suggestion, Congress MP and spokesperson Manish Tewari said the idea of rationalisation in the day and age of digital media by moving government and PSU advertisements like public notices to e-portal to cut wasteful expenditure was under consideration even during the UPA government.Tewari, who served as Minister of Information and Broadcasting in the Manmohan Singh government, said according to a study done during the time of 10 top print medium newspapers, it had been found that the revenue from government/PSUs did not constitute more than 10 per cent of the total revenue they earned.Print medium, he said, would have to find a way of surviving without depending on government support, pointing out that it was the small and medium newspapers, especially the vernacular press, that hugely relied on such support.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/take-back-your-proposal-ins-to-congress-president-68584

HCQ availability will be ensured as per our need today and tomorrow,” Health Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said. The ministry’s assurance came as 853 additional Covid cases and 32 more deaths were reported in a single day.India manufactures around 20 crore HCQ tablets of 200 mg each every month and local consumption averages 2.40 crore tablets a year. India accounts for 70 per cent of all HCQ manufacturing globally and is a leading exporter. The drug has become critical to fight against Covid-19 with proven efficacy in reducing the viral load.The ICMR reiterated today that they have permitted the use of HCQ only for preventive purposes in two high-risk categories of people — doctors in care of Covid patients and home contacts of patients. The drug is to be sold solely on medical prescription.The government, meanwhile, advised states to undertake extensive surveillance and contact tracing in their zones apart from building Covid-related healthcare infrastructure as proposed in the new official guidance released yesterday.The next two focus areas of the government are – boosting hospital preparedness and testing.With antibody test kits arriving from Singapore to enable blood sample tests of people with influenza like illness in disease clusters, India hopes to ramp up testing scopes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ramp-up-hcq-production-government-to-firms-68582

Stating that the pandemic forced the government to take strict measures and expect more when the situation demands, sources privy to the discussion said there was enough indication from the PM that removing all restrictions at the end of the 21-day lockdown period was not favoured. The government is mulling all options, including a partial lockdown or blanket extension. Much would depend on the data being collected with April 10 as the cutoff. The PM will hold another round of interaction with the chief ministers on Sunday before taking a final call.80% for extending lockdown80% leaders from various parties who interacted with the PM via video-conferencing favoured extending the lockdown. — Ghulam Nabi Azad, CongressOfficial sources said the PM told the leaders: “It’s an epoch-changing event in mankind’s history and we must evolve to counter its impact.” The leaders appreciated the timely measures. They talked about boosting the health and morale of healthcare workers, ramping up testing facilities, the need to assist smaller states/UTs and tackling hunger and malnutrition.Suggestions were made on extending the lockdown and on a phased exit. Some members raised the issue of suspension of MPLADS fund, urging the government to reconsider it. Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Rout said if required the government could further deduct up to 15 per cent of salary. The Left sought reinstatement of MPLADS while also raising more allocation to states, taking care of daily and low-wage earners and NRIs returning to India following job loss.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/its-akin-to-social-emergency-says-modi-68581

We have to move fast, decisively, and together,” ILO Director-General Guy Ryder said.Worldwide, 200 crore people work in the informal sector and are particularly at risk, the report said. “In India, with a share of almost 90 per cent of people working in the informal economy, about 400m (40 crore) workers in the informal economy are at risk of falling deeper into poverty during the crisis. Current lockdown measures have impacted these workers significantly, forcing many of them to return to rural areas,” it said. — PTI81% workforce hit||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/40-crore-indians-may-sink-into-poverty-ilo-68574

Several start-ups have developed rather creative and innovative ways to address these needs. The DST is supporting the most promising of these,” said Prof Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iit-bombay-to-develop-gel-for-nasal-passage-68568

Modi’s tweets were in response to an unsigned message circulating online that asked people to give him a standing ovation for five minutes at 5 pm on Sunday for the work he has been doing for the nation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prime-minister-disapproves-of-campaign-to-honour-him-68567

It will be pertinent to take note of the fact that India’s first line of workers is already engaged in Covid relief and doing commendable job.”It said, “However, a larger force will be needed to replace the first line and to tackle the exponential or geometric increase in positive Covid-19 cases in the subsequent stages of the pandemic.”Though the circular did not elaborate in what context the country was facing higher threat, it said, to take care of the training needs of the frontline workers, “the launch of the integrated government online training (iGOT) platform has been fast-forwarded, and a version of iGOT fitted to these needs has been launched”.“The platform will provide the training modules on flexitime and on site basis so that the Covid response can be delivered at scale for the workforce needed to tackle the pandemic,” it further said.The courses on iGOT, it said, have been launched for doctors, nurses, paramedics, hygiene workers, technicians, auxiliary nursing midwives (ANMs), state government officers and civil defence officials, among others.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-plans-larger-force-to-replace-frontline-workers-managing-crisis-68566
09-04-2020||---||Industry leaders insist on relief, bailout package||New Delhi, April 8The industry is displaying impatience over one of the world’s most aggressive lockdowns despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi telling a meeting of parliamentary floor leaders today that its relaxation does not seem possible. The only ray of hope is that the PM has spoken about taking on board the views of chief ministers who at present hold different views.FICCI is in favour of phased opening of non-hotspot economic markets and boosting Covid-19 medical support across India. “This will instil confidence and preparation for the industry, and we stand united in extending support to the Business Continuity Plan,’’ said FICCI president Sangita Reddy.The CII, too, is of the view that the shutdown should be lifted as early as feasible, in a safe and calibrated manner. “It is important to safeguard the macro fundamentals to ensure that the country does not suffer significant rating downgrades and potential flight of capital,’’ said CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee.With India forecast to log barely one to two per cent GDP growth in the 2020-21 fiscal, the industry is also seeking a bailout package.The PHD Chamber expects an additional Rs 9 lakh crore stimulus package which its president DK Aggarwal estimates will help GDP growth rate reach five per cent. The government has already provided a stimulus of Rs 2 lakh crore, therefore, “our expectation is for the remaining Rs 9 lakh crore in terms of various relief measures and benefits to India’s trade and industry,’’ he added.The PHD Chamber has also sought an automatic increase of 25% in working capital which should be allowed to convert into a term-loan with a provision of three-year repayment period.The industry also wants the government to pay 75 per cent of salary of the workers during the lockdown and employer contribution in PPFs be brought down to zero.The CII has suggested a fiscal support package of two per cent of the GDP in addition to the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana. It wanted additional support to the people at the bottom of the pyramid and support to industry through the banking system.“Our estimates are that the economy will need a credit expansion of 14-15 per cent. Additionally, support through banks will allow the government a leverage of 5-6 times, mitigating the fiscal impact,” said Banerjee while supporting the PHD Chamber’s pleas for working capital enhancement and support for payment of wages to all industry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/industry-leaders-insist-on-relief-bailout-package-68559
