A few days before US President Donald Trump’s visit to India, USCIRF released a factsheet that said the CAA was a “significant downward trend in religious freedom” in India. The USCIRF also criticised the Delhi riots that began when Trump was in India, and urged the Modi government to protect religious minorities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-hits-back-at-downgrade-by-us-panel-77597

28-04-2020||New Delhi||Bar Council of India against hearings via video conferencing post lockdown||Expressing reservations over hearings via video conferencing, Bar Council of India Chairman Manan Kumar Mishra has demanded that the practice should stop when COVID-19 lockdown is lifted.“If such practice is encouraged and allowed to continue, there is not an iota of doubt that more than 95% of the advocates of the country will become brief less and work less and the practice of law will be confined to a limited group of lawyers and justice delivery would be badly affected,” Mishra said in a letter addressed to Chief Justice of India SA Bobde.The Supreme Court, high courts and most of the subordinate courts across India have been functioning in a restricted manner via video conferencing for over a month due to COVID-19 lockdown.Noting that resorting to technology and video conference hearings in such times is the “need of the hour”, the BCI chairman said extending this practice beyond the lockdown would be “impractical”.Many senior advocates, retired judges and even some sitting judges of the Supreme Court didn’t know the ground realities of India, he said.“They are thinking on such a tangent and making such utopian plans as if they are planning upon implementing and executing such ideas for a fully developed nation like (the) UK, (the) USA, or in some country other than India,” Mishra wrote.Pointing out that all members of the legal fraternity did not have access to the requisite technological resources, he contended that 90% of the advocates and judges across India would not be aware of the technology at use and its nuances.They would require some degree of training before the technology can be put to use by them, he said, adding many of these courts, or advocates practising there, may not be equipped with the modern technology required for e-filing, scanning and video conferencing.“Justice is expected to permeate to all levels,” he emphasised.He said a vast majority of lawyers apprehended that there was a conspiracy to limit the access to courts in the hands of a few elite class having nexus with big families.“Our thought process is very advanced, and it should be so too, but we can’t be jumping the gun and foraying into a totally impractical and unworkable world,” he wrote.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bar-council-of-india-against-hearings-via-video-conferencing-post-lockdown-77594
28-04-2020||New Delhi||India will be self-reliant in producing RT-PCR testing kits by May-end: Centre||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday said the country will be self-reliant in producing RT-PCR and antibody testing kits by May-end that will enable it to conduct one lakh tests a day.Vardhan also reviewed through video conferencing various initiatives undertaken by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) to tackle the COVID-19 crisis.Out of at least half a dozen candidates (companies) supported for vaccines, four are in an advanced stage and regulatory platform at one place has been constituted for speedy clearances, he was quoted as saying in a statement.Renu Swarup, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, informed that her department has evolved a multi-pronged research strategy and action plan for immediate responses as well as for long-term preparedness to tackle COVID-19.These multi-faceted efforts include research towards development of therapeutics and suitable animal testing for coronavirus as well as development of indigenous diagnostics and genomic studies on the host and pathogen.The DBT and its public sector undertakings, Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), has announced a COVID-19 Research Consortium Call to support diagnostics, vaccines, novel therapeutics, repurposing of drugs or any other intervention for control of COVID-19.“The sincere efforts of DBT scientists will enable the country to be self-reliant in production of RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and antibody testing kits by the end of next month. This will make it possible to meet the target of conducting one lakh tests per day,” he said.Vardhan, who is also Science and Technology minister, exhorted scientists working on developing new vaccines, drugs and medical equipment to speed up their work.Testing is one of the key elements in fighting COVID-19. Last week, the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) stopped rapid testing after they showed satisfactory results.Vardhan also released a hand sanitiser developed by another PSU of DBT, Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Corporation Ltd (BIBCOL), which is engaged in manufacturing of various biological, pharmaceutical and food products.It is currently manufacturing formulations of vitamin C and zinc tablets to contribute towards the solution for COVID-19. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-will-be-self-reliant-in-producing-rt-pcr-testing-kits-by-may-end-centre-77593

The officer could not be contacted for comment.The Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) of Kota, Dilip Saini, too, rejected the family’s allegation about policemen ignoring the plight of the patient being carted to a hospital on a handcart.“It is hypothetical to say that the policemen did not help. The policemen in the area did not have any vehicle or an ambulance, which could have been summoned only from a hospital or the ambulance service numbers 104 or 108,” said Saini.

28-04-2020||Chennai||Sale of fuel dropped 10% more than normal due to COVID-19: CIPD||The Consortium of Indian Petroleum Dealers have for the second time written to the three major oil companies, seeking a stimulus financial package, saying it is very challenging to operate as fuel sales have dropped more than 10 per cent from normal due to the COVID-19 outbreak.CIPD President M Narayana Prasad said the Oil Marketing Companies HPCL, IOCL, BPCL had neglected to revise the dealer margins since August 2017 which subsequently led to retail outlet operations becoming ‘exceptionally challenging’.CIPD had already written a similar letter to the OMCs on April 11.While salaries and operational costs for the quarter ending March 2020 amid the difficulties emerged due to the coronavirus outbreak, “the sales of motor spirit and high speed diesel have dipped no more than an average of 10 per cent of normal sale,” Prasad said.The financial challenges faced by retail outlets in absence of sales volume have rendered operations ‘unviable’ since dealer margins were based on volumetric litre sales, he said.Noting that the retail outlets have taken up various measures in keeping the surroundings clean and hygienic as part of the measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, he said expenses also need to be ‘immediately re compensated’.A further delay in release of a stimulus financial package would render future operations to miserably fail and collapse, he said.“In the absence of liquidity and funds to keep retail outlets operational from May 2020 or until the complete lifting of lock-down period, daily funds have dried up from the last quarter of March 2020 till date without the much needed relief forthcoming from oil marketing companies”, he said.In Tamil Nadu, all fuel outlets have been directed to operate between 8 am to 12 noon due to the lockdown in force.

28-04-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||BRICS readies $15-billion Covid loan package||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 28A webinar by BRICS foreign ministers on Tuesday decided to increase emergency aid from their common bank by $ 15 billion to help its five founding members – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa—during the Covid epidemic.The BRICS Bank, called the New Development Bank (NDB) and headed by former ICICI Bank chief K V Kamath, has already allocated $ 1 billion to India out of $ 5 billion in its first tranche of loans. India has asked NDB to double the amount to $ 10 billion.In case the $ 15 billion decided today is apportioned equally, India should get $ 3 billion. If the $ 1 billion announced earlier is also added, NDB with $ 4 billion (about Rs 30,000 crore) to India is the biggest multilateral loan provider so far. The ADB has promised $ 2.1 billion to India and the World Bank $ 1 billion but both will substantially increase the Covid package.Making the announcement, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, “We also discussed the illegitimate curse of unilateral measures, or so-called sanctions outside the UN charter that puts obstacles to our effort to combat Covid.” Lavrov was referring to US sanctions against Russia and Iran that have not been approved by the UN.A Ministry of External Affairs statement was silent on both aspects but highlighted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s suggestion for BRICS to support and recognise the efficacy of traditional medicine systems to strengthen immunity.He also emphasised that the current challenge underlines all the more the need for reform of multilateral systems. Jaishankar also spoke about the $ 23 billion package for the poor and the Arogya Setu Citizen App.Lavrov said the “common opinion” at the webinar was that the World Health Organisation was a “very important instrument, a unique platform” that gathers all information and makes it available to countries. Asked whether BRICS countries will make up for the shortfall because of US decision not to contribute its share to WHO, Lavrov said the US was also the biggest beneficiary. Most of the staff in the WHO Secretariat are Americans, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/brics-readies-15-billion-covid-loan-package-77584

These protocols may be widely disseminated among the healthcare service providers and it may be emphasized that testing for COVID-19 has to be as per the protocols,” Sudan said.Healthcare providers may be advised to take necessary precautions for personal protection as per ministry’s guidelines on rational use of Personal Protective Guidelines, the letter said.Guidelines for Infection Prevention and Control in Healthcare Facilities may also be widely disseminated among the healthcare institutions, both public and private, the Health Secretary said.Noting that the Ministry has also issued guidelines to be followed on detection of suspect or confirmed COVID-19 case in a non-COVID-19 health facility, Sudan said these guidelines have been issued to facilitate continuance of services in such health facilities after disinfection as per the Standard Operating Procedures specified in the guidelines.The enforcement machinery in the states and UTs may be suitably sensitized about these guidelines and may be directed that they are implemented in true letter and spirit to obviate the fear of closure of health facilities for prolonged periods of time.Helplines set up by the States and UTs should receive grievances regarding denial of critical services especially on account of insistence on testing, the letter said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ensure-critical-health-services-like-dialysis-blood-transfusion-not-denied-centre-to-states-77581

Some of them even have housing colonies located within complex.Meanwhile, Singh appreciated the monetary contribution of about Rs 77 crore made by the Department of Defence Production (DDP), Ministry of Defence (MoD), OFB and DPSUs to the PM CARES Fund, generated from Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds and one day salary contribution.Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) has made arrangements to manufacture 12,000 ventilators in the month of May 2020 and another 18,000 in June 2020. Around 3,000 engineers will also participate in training of the health professionals in operationalising these ventilators.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-banks-on-dpsu-and-private-defence-industry-for-economic-revival-77580

Students should be promoted on the basis of performance in internal exams like it was done for students of Class IX and XI,” Sisodia said.“The curriculum for the next academic session should also reduced by 30 per cent and  competitive exams such as the JEE and the NEET be conducted on the basis of the reduced syllabus,” he added.Sisodia also put forward the Delhi government’s demand of airtime on Doordarshan and the All-India Radio (AIR) for broadcasting on-air classes by teachers of its schools.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16 when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as one of the measures to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had earlier announced that it would be conducting the pending board exams for only 29 subjects, which are crucial for the promotion and admission in undergraduate programmes.However, there is no clarity on when the exams will be conducted even as the HRD Ministry has assured that students will be given at least a 10-day notice before the conduct of exams.Responding to a question of conducting the remaining board exams, Pokhriyal told parents in an interaction on Monday that the pending exams would be conducted at the first possible opportunity.

The two spoke around the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed with Japanese PM Shinzo Abe the global health and economic challenges emerging out of the pandemic. Japan exerts considerable influence on ADB and the institution’s chief is always from that country.An official news release here said the loan to India will focus on disease containment and prevention besides social protection, especially for the women and disadvantaged groups. This suggests that part of the loan will be from a $13 billion ADB corpus for “countercyclical expenditure programmes” that has a focus on the poor and the vulnerable. Another part aimed at women and the socially disadvantaged will be from a $ 2 billion ADB package meant for that specific purpose.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-adb-chief-promises-india-more-loan-if-needed-77564

I then asked my friend who participates in Ramlilas to arrange for the dress. My wife and my friend did all the makeup work. To make it a modern Yamraj, I also put on goggles,” Singh said."We took a round of the area on Monday,” the 42-year-old said.Yamraj on a Gypsy and making announcements on a loudspeaker grabbed eyeballs and a lot of attention."I have sent my ambassador corona. If you don't listen to Delhi Police, he will take you with him. Only Delhi Police stands between you and me. Delhiites, I warn you… if you love your life, then please stay inside your houses," Singh intoned in Hindi over the loudspeaker as he was driven through the lanes of the sprawling government colony.Singh, also the president of the Central Government Residents Welfare Association, Sector-1, R K Puram, said the group has been urging people to follow rules since the lockdown started.Rajesh Sharma, station house officer of R K Puram, said the idea was to educate people in a more innovative way."It was my idea to interact with the public in a different and more interesting way, so we can successfully send our message. We just want to educate people regarding the coronavirus as punishing them is not the solution. We also want people to help police in battling this pandemic.” His colleagues in other parts of the city are innovating too.#DelhiPolice, with the help of a local artist dressed as Yamraj, created awareness among the people and appealed to them to remain indoor during lockdown. Announcement was made by them for the people in RK Puram area, in a bid to create awareness.@DelhiPolice pic.twitter.com/SIeSRXTOxK  In Dwarka, they modified helmets into the shape of the coronavirus and, with the help of some volunteers, appealed to people to take necessary precautions in the wake of the pandemic.The volunteers wore the modified helmets and moved in Dwarka District area, interacting with the public and urged them to follow government guidelines and stay at home during the lockdown.

28-04-2020||New Delhi||Deemed universities come under PCA, rules SC||Deemed universities fall within the ambit of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and their employees and trustees are public servants who can be prosecuted for illegal gratification, the Supreme Court has ruled.“It cannot be stated that a ‘Deemed University’ and the officials therein, perform any less or any different a public duty, than those performed by a university simpliciter, and the officials therein,” a three-judge Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana said.The Bench reversed a Gujarat High Court verdict that excluded “Deemed Universities” from the meaning of “University” under the PC Act, terming it “incorrect”.“We are of the opinion that the high court was incorrect in holding that a ‘Deemed University’ is excluded from the ambit of the term ‘University’ under Section 2©(xi) of the PC Act,” the top court said.Mansukhbhai Kanjibhai Shah, a trustee of Sumandeep Charitable Trust which runs ‘Sumandeep Vidyapeeth’—a deemed university, was accused of demanding a bribe of Rs 20 lakh to allow an MBBS student to write her examination. He was prosecuted for corruption under the PCA.He had contended that he was only a trustee of a charitable trust and had no role to play in the running of the deemed university.The Gujarat High Court ruled that “University” as defined under Section 2©(xi) of the PCA would not cover an institution “deemed to be a University”.A deemed university and a university are treated differently and the University Grants Commission Act made the distinction in all aspects, except funding, the high court said.However, the top court refused to discharge him saying, “Prima facie, a grave suspicion is made out that the respondent was rendering his service by dealing with the students and the examination aspect of the university.”The high court failed to analyse the connection between the trust and the deemed university, it said.“The UGC Act and the PC Act are enactments which are completely distinct in their purpose, operation and object...As such, the extension of technical definitions used under one Act to the other might not be appropriate, as the two Acts are not in pari materia with one another,” the top court said.To Shah’s argument that the word “University” needs to be read strictly in accordance with the provisions of the UGC Act, which defines “University” and a “Deemed University” differently and separately, the top court said definitions cannot be borrowed from the UGC Act while deciding a case under the PCA.The term “public servant” under Section 2© of the PCA did not give an exhaustive list of the posts covered under it. Instead, it accorded a general meaning to the nature of the public duty performed, it said interpreting second explanation of Section 2 of PCA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/deemed-universities-come-under-pca-rules-sc-77555

Decreasing the potential for people to come in contact with wild animals is the “one way to decrease the likelihood of having recurrent pandemics” its researchers were quoted as saying.  “Greater number of species diversity in a wild ecosystem works through what is called the ‘dilution effect’ and the chance of a pathogen jumping to an outside species reduces considerably,” Dutta explains, quoting studies on the issue by researchers from Montana University (on rodent Hantavirus), University of Adelaide and Fudan University (fungal disease incidence among alpine meadow plants).“They have repeatedly shown this dilution effect with higher biodiversity and increased risks of human infections with new pathogens when we destroy wild habitats and intrude upon previously isolated natural ecosystems,” he adds.  Incidentally, rodent Hantavirus causes Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in humans.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/destruction-of-forests-increasing-possibility-of-viruses-jumping-from-animals-to-humans-77547

28-04-2020||Kochi||5 million people displaced in India due to disasters in 2019: Report||Five million people were displaced in India last year, the highest in the world, due to disasters, including cyclones and monsoon floods, a new report by a monitoring centre said.The displacements were a result of a combination of increasing hazard intensity, high population exposure and high levels of social and economic vulnerability, the report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) released on Tuesday said.South Asia recorded 9.5 million new displacements associated with disasters in 2019, the highest figure since 2012 and the floods triggered by the monsoon in India and Bangladesh and cyclones Fani and Bulbul were among the events that forced most people to flee their homes both in the region and globally.While India reported 50,37,000 displacements, Bangladesh recorded 40,86,520 in the year 2019. The other countries with new displacements are Afghanistan (5,78,000), Nepal (1,21,000) and Pakistan (1,16,000), according to the data provided in the report by the Geneva-based centre."There were thought to be around 5,90,000 people living in internal displacement as a result of disasters across the country as of 31 December, but the figure is highly conservative given the high number of new displacements and the damages and losses recorded during the year", it said.According to the report, "conflict and violence" triggered about 19,000 new displacements in the country last year."Political and electoral violence, primarily in Tripura and West Bengal in the first half of the year, accounted for more than 7,600. Lesser unrest and inter-communal violence continued to trigger displacement in the second half of the year," the report said.The year was also the seventh warmest in India since 1901 and the monsoon was the wettest in 25 years. These conditions helped to fuel the destructive power of the eight tropical storms to hit the country during the year.The most severe was cyclone Fani, which tracked across the states of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal in early May, before moving north to Bangladesh.As it approached the coast of Odisha with maximum sustained windspeeds up to 240 km/h, the government organised the evacuation of more than 1.8 million people, it said.The states disaster management authorities were lauded for their lifesaving operations.Another 2,89,000 people were evacuated in Gujarat in June ahead of cyclone Vayu, which changed track and reduced in intensity before making landfall later than expected.The south-west monsoon triggered more than 2.6 million displacements in the months that followed.The north-west monsoon continued to trigger displacement in October and November, along with cyclone Maha, which hit Kerala and the Lakshwadeep islands on October 31."Cyclone Bulbul struck Odisha and West Bengal ten days later, triggering 1,86,000 displacements", it said.The report said drought displacement was also recorded in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.Water shortages in Maharashtra between March and June forced about 50,000 farmers and their families to take refuge in cattle camps, displacement sites run by NGOs where livestock is also fed and watered," the report said.It said conflict and violence also triggered displacements in Afghanistan, India and Pakistan and to a lesser extent in Sri Lanka in 2019 with around 4,98,000 new displacements recorded across the region as a whole.The annual total has fallen over the past decade, mainly because of the "de-escalation" of violence in Pakistan, the report said.Afghanistan's conflict, however, shows little sign of abating, the report said.Around four million people were living in displacement as a result of conflict and violence as of the end of the year, with Afghanistan accounting for 75 per cent of the regional total, it added.IDMC says its global report on in internal displacement (GRID) 2020 is the global reference for internal displacement data and analysis and is widely used by policy-makers, national governments, UN agencies, international NGOs, jounalists and academics.

The media can be asked to clarify a negative news report but filing cases and arresting them amounts to terrorising the media, the former CM claimed.Fadnavis further pointed out that journalist Arnab Goswami was grilled for 12 hours by the police in connection with a news programme he hosted.Those speaking out against the state government on social media are also being harassed, adding that even distribution of newspapers was being curtailed in the name of a health threat.The door-to-door delivery of newspapers has been prohibited in containment areas to stop the spread of Covid-19.“We urge you to intervene and seek a response from the state government,” Fadnavis told the governor.

28-04-2020||Kolkata/ Kharagpur||31-year-old research scholar found hanging in IIT-Kharagpur hostel||The body of a 31-year-old research scholar of IIT-Kharagpur was found hanging in his hostel room, police said on Tuesday.The body of Bhavanibhatla Kondal Rao was found in his room on the second floor of the BR Ambedkar Hall around 10 am on Monday, they said.Unable to contact him over the phone, his parents informed other inmates of the hostel. They found Rao’s room locked from inside and after repeated knocking when he did not open the door, they informed the police, an official said.The police rushed to the hostel and broke open the door and found the body hanging, he said.Rao, a resident of Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, was a research scholar in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. He got married in February at his hometown and after staying there with his family for around two weeks, he returned to the campus before the lockdown began, according to district police sources.His wife is in Chennai at present, where she is working, they said.IIT-Kharagpur director VK Tewari, who described Rao as a “bright young scholar”, said the institute had got in touch with his family. He said Rao is suspected to have committed suicide and the matter was being investigated.Police said the body has been sent for post-mortem examination and the reason behind the incident is being probed.Very few students are currently on the campus as most had returned home before the lockdown was imposed.Rao, who joined the Indian Institute of Technology- Kharagpur in 2015, was about to complete his research project, his friends said. They remembered him as a jovial person and popular among students and faculty members.Some also said he was under mental stress but didn’t share it with anyone. Following Rao’s death, the director, in a Facebook post, urged students to connect with friends who needed support.“Look beyond the hurdles which at present may seem like the most critical chapter of your life but are mere speed-breakers if you are able to envision your life in the long run,” he said.“Try to reach out to us, your faculty supervisors, the counselling centre and your peers. Talk to your friends and family, your seniors, your juniors, they are only a tap away from your phone in this century and at this time,” Tewari said in his post.

In furtherance of the same, I am attaching herewith the names of 32 recovered patients who are willing to donate their plasma and contribute in helping patients who are currently affected by COVID-19,” he said in the letter dated April 27.Plasma treatment is done by taking blood plasma from a cured Covid-19 patient to treat positive cases to effectively strengthen the immune system.The state government has got the Centre's approval to use plasma therapy in the treatment of Covid-19 patients.“I hope that this contribution from recovered patients will go a long way in the government efforts to treat Covid-19 patients in the state,” the Hyderabad MP said.The number of Covid-19 positive cases in the state rose to 1,003 while the active patients stood at 646 with the total discharges at 332 and 25 deaths, a government bulletin said on Monday.

The son was booked under the National Security Act (NSA) and sent to the Jabalpur Central Jail where he tested positive for Covid-19 on April 11, Bhangre said.On getting information about his son, the 58-year-old prisoner was immediately admitted to a hospital in Indore where his test report came out positive on April 14, he added.Nearly 2,050 prisoners are lodged in the Indore Central Jail as against its capacity of 1,230, another prison official said.“We are screening all prisoners daily. Those having flu-like symptoms or fever are being quarantined,” he added.

28-04-2020||New Delhi||Plasma therapy not proven treatment for COVID-19, illegal right now: Health Ministry||After a series of recent announcements by some state governments regarding the use of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID patients, the central government categorically said on Tuesday that it was not yet a proven or approved therapy to treat coronavirus and its use was illegal and could even be life threatening for patients.Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said on Tuesday that plasma therapy was still under experimental stages in India and the world and the ICMR has not yet approved this therapy for use in patients.“The ICMR is currently undertaking a pan India study to determine the efficacy of plasma therapy in COVID patients and the plasma from cured patients can only be used for trial and research purposes and not for treatment. Such use is illegal and can have life threatening complications for those who are administered plasma,” Agarwal made clear.He said until ICMR published scientific evidence to approve plasma therapy as an approved treatment therapy in COVID patients it cannot be used by anyone for treatment.Even the US FDA has approved the use of plasma therapy only for experimental purposes and not for treatment.Worldwide studies are currently underway on various therapies against COVID, plasma being one of them.Antibody rich blood from COVID cured patients is being currently tested for evidence of whether it can help cure or decrease the severity of the infection.Agarwal also said 17 districts in the country have had no coronavirus cases in 28 days.India reported 1,543 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, taking total number of cases to 29,435 infections, the ministry said.Some 6,868 COVID-19 patients---23.3 per cent of total cases--- have recovered so far, the health ministry.

28-04-2020||New Delhi||Oncologists fear delayed cancer diagnosis, stage migration amid COVID-19 crisis||With people fearing about visits to hospitals amid the coronavirus outbreak, delayed diagnosis of cancer and its stage migration could be a fallout of the current crisis, according to senior oncologists.While many medical treatments can be put off amid the COVID-19 crisis, "cancer does not wait", oncologists feel.Cancer treatment in times of coronavirus has been challenging as the pandemic is impacting both cancer diagnostics and treatment, with doctors having to balance risks versus benefits on a daily basis.Dr Bhawna Sirohi, director of Medical Oncology at Max Healthcare, said cancer is "not going to wait" and the threat from it is "now and real"."I feel patients, scared because of COVID-19, are not coming to hospitals and that is pushing them from early cancer to late stages," she told PTI.Sirohi urged patients not to be scared to come to hospitals and if they have a warning sign like a lump, they should not delay treatment.She said she recently had a patient who ignored symptoms for three weeks and delayed consulting a doctor but was later detected with cancer.COVID-19 is here to stay and one just has to get used to the precautions and make it a new normal, she said."Stage 1 and 2 (of cancer) can become 3 and 4, it can become incurable, if you don't act upon it," Sirohi said.Talking about cancer treatment in times of COVID-19, she said a balance has to be maintained between risks and benefits."If the benefit is very small then one should avoid chemotherapy. But if you have a patient with lymphoma or blood cancer then the cure rates are very high, so you would want to go for the benefits," she said.Dr Akshay Tiwari, Associate Director and Head, Musculoskeletal Oncology, Max Healthcare, said as a bone cancer surgeon he is facing challenges at multiple levels.Patients are finding it very difficult to travel and even those who have the wherewithal to travel, are scared of coming to the hospital for the fear of contracting coronavirus, he said.This means that patients who should have been seeking treatment are not doing so and that would lead to a stage migration of cancer, Tiwari said."Some cases may even become incurable because of the delay. We are fearing this as patients are not coming to us. Similar fears have been voiced by cancer specialists across the world," he told PTI.The message should go to the public that cancer does not wait and it is even deadlier than COVID-19, the senior oncologist said."Diagnosis may also be delayed and that is what is unfortunate. The message needs to go out that we should not ignore symptoms which are remotely linked to cancer, for example, a lump or swelling," he said.Dr. Rajender Kumar, Additional Director and Head of Oncology at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, said the COVID-19 crisis is definitely posing a challenge to cancer treatment as many patients with malignancy in the head and neck area or having lung cancer have symptoms similar to COVID-19."We are using all the precautions and the staff is using PPEs as cancer treatment is essential," he told PTI.Asked whether the COVID-19 pandemic can lead to delayed cancer diagnosis, Kumar said patients are coming to his hospital and their numbers have not decreased, but it is a possibility as most of the routine clinics and hospitals are shut down and people are not going to their doctors."We don't have data on it, but it can happen," Kumar said.Dr. Niranjan Naik, Director - Breast & Gastro-intestinal (GI) Onco-Surgery, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, said the COVID-19 crisis is posing a challenge as patients with low immunity are at a higher risk of contracting the virus.He said the key aspect while making decisions is the cancer doubling time which is different for different cancers, with blood cancer being very aggressive as compared with breast cancer."Whenever any symptoms emerge, one should get proper medical investigations done even in the present times as cancer will not wait," Naik told PTI.As the nation fights one of its biggest health battles against COVID-19 pandemic, there are many individual battles being fought by bravehearts, both doctors and patients, to emerge victorious against other life-threatening diseases.

They should also have to implement the standard operating protocol as mentioned in the Karnataka Revised Consolidated Guidelines, the order said. The employers will have to arrange the transportation of workers in a dedicated vehicle ensuring social distancing.Similarly, shops, including those in residential complexes and market complexes, and registered under the Shops and Establishment Act, except multi-brand and single brand malls, have been permitted to operate outside the limits of municipal corporations and municipalities.In areas coming under Municipal Corporations and municipalities, all shops — neighbourhood and standalone, and shops in residential complexes — will be allowed to function. However,  multi-brand and single brand malls and shops in market complexes will not be permitted in these areas.All shops will have to function with 50 per cent workers and they should wear masks and maintain social distancing.In the districts of Bellary, Mandya, Bengaluru Rual, Gadag, Tumkuru, Chickkaballapur, Uttar Kannada and Dharwad, the decision regarding opening of shops and industries in tehsils where there are no active Covid-19 cases will be taken by concerned district in charge minister, the order said.In the districts of Bengaluru Urban, Belagavi, Mysuru, Vijaypura, Bagalkot, Kalburgi, Bidar and Dakshina Kannada, which are red zones for Covid-19, the existing guidelines and addendums will continue to be in force without any change during the lockdown, it said.

28-04-2020||New Delhi||Nation awaits clear exit strategy from lockdown: Cong to PM||The Congress, on Tuesday, asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to spell out a clear exit strategy for Covid-19 lockdown after May 3, saying the nation is waiting for it.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the prime minister is expected to lead the nation in crisis like these. “We once again appeal to the Prime Minister to come out with a clear exit strategy for the lockdown, to state the roadmap for economic revival and to deal with the health pandemic post May 3, as also restrict the lockdown only to hotspot zones,” he told reporters at a press conference through video conferencing.He said the chief ministers requested the Prime Minister to tell the nation what is the exit strategy from the lockdown. “What is the government’s strategy on the health front and the economic front in terms of post-lockdown period. What is the roadmap for the future course after May 3?” he added.“How is the Prime Minister going to come out with financial action plan as Sonia Gandhi has demanded and so have many experts, be it for starvation, migrant labour, or be it for kickstarting the economy or the small and medium enterprises,” the Congress leader said.The appeal comes a day after Modi met chief ministers of various states through video-conferencing and sought their views, while also spelling out the government's strategy on tackling Covid-19.Most chief ministers have demanded extension of the lockdown and urged the Prime Minister to take a call on the exit strategy, while asking him to have a cautious approach in opening it.

28-04-2020||New Delhi||E-education no child's play, teachers putting tremendous efforts in online classes, says HC||Providing e-education is no child's play and efforts made by a teacher giving online classes are more than those required in the physical classroom, the Delhi High Court has observed while refusing to direct private schools not to charge tuition fees during the lockdown period.The court said it requires extensive infrastructural adjustments, including all incidental expenses in arranging access to online platforms over which education could be provided and “to suggest that, having made all these arrangements, schools should not be permitted to charge tuition fees, would be bordering on absurdity”.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar, conducting the hearing through video conferencing, refused to entertain a petition seeking direction to the private schools not to charge tuition fees from the students keeping in view the present situation arising out of COVID-19, at least during the lockdown period.The plea, filed by a practising lawyer, also sought to set aside or modify Delhi government's April 17 order to the extent that tuition fees, if any, be charged after an appropriate and reasonable time from the re-opening of the schools.The court said the Delhi government order notes the effort by several private schools to disseminate education online as a welcome step which is aimed at ensuring that students do not suffer in their curricular activities during the 2020-21 academic session.“We wholeheartedly endorse this sentiment. Judicial notice may be taken of the painstaking efforts, made by schools and teachers, in providing education, and holding classes, through online platforms. The effort in physically teaching students, in a regular classroom, cannot even remotely be compared with the effort that the teacher has to expend, in providing online education,” the bench said.The court added: “It is a matter of common knowledge that, in doing so, the effort required to be put in, by the teacher, and the strain to which the teacher subjects herself, or himself, is tremendous, and the efforts of teachers – referred to, often, as the noblest among all noble professions – require to be commended in the highest terms."We unhesitatingly place, on record, our wholehearted appreciation, of the efforts of teachers, and schools, towards this end.”The court said the submission of petitioner advocate Prashant Kumar that no tuition fees be charged by schools during the lockdown as the institutions are closed is “fundamentally misconceived”.“So long as schools are disseminating education online, they are certainly entitled to charge tuition fees. Rather, the expenditure involved in disseminating education online may, conceivably, be much greater than that involved in classroom teaching. Providing e-education is no child's play…,” the court said in its 21-page order.Delhi government standing counsel Ramesh Singh apprised the court that the April 17 order prohibits schools from denying access to online classes to students whose parents are unable to pay the fees due to financial crisis in the lockdown period.The court noted that fees related to expenditure incurred on activities like sports, transportation and other developments stand completely exempted by the government's April 17 order.However, it does not exempt students from the requirement of payment of tuition fees for the simple reason that tuition fees cover salary, establishments and curricular activities, the expenditure where on continues to be incurred by schools, even during the period of lockdown, and before they are able to resume normal work, the court noted.“Money does not grow on trees, and unaided schools, who received no funds from the government, are entirely dependent on fees, to defray their daily expenses. We, therefore, find that, in allowing unaided schools to charge tuition fees, whereby expenses incurred on salary, establishments and curricular activities may be defrayed by them, the impugned order dated April 17, 2020, strikes a wholesome balance, with which we are ill-inclined to interfere,” the court said.The court observed that consequent on the global devastation wrought by the coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic, to which India is no exception, the executive administration has had to take certain hard-hitting decisions and to put in place a slew of curbs, restraints and containments to minimise the societal effect of the viral pandemic.“It is incumbent, on every member of the populace, to be aware of the forbidding nature of the struggle, between man and microbe, in which each one of us is a participant, willing or unwilling."A joint, cohesive and concerted effort, alone, can result in success in this struggle. This would involve, in its wake, certain sacrifices, which, within the peripheries of the law, each one of us has to make. We cannot afford, in such a situation, to balk at inconveniences,” it said.

28-04-2020||New Delhi||Micro zoning can control next wave of COVID epidemic||As India moves into an uncertain phase, where the efforts to combat COVID will have to be balanced with the need for restoring normalcy, a start-up has sought to provide a solution to the unlocking of billion-plus human life.Since physical distancing will always be a challenge in a country like India, Sociometrik has identified micro risk zones within seven larger metropolitan regions (megacities) that could be potential hotbeds for the spread of contagion.These micro risk zones can be used by relevant authorities for close targeted monitoring of potential outbreaks in the future especially when lockdown measures are eased, and case count starts coming down.This could be a broad-based approach towards containing a second wave. Another way this can be leveraged is when combined with current cases of location data, these spatial-demographic variables can act as predictors to predict the location of future outbreaks in a machine learning framework.“All indicators are pointing towards a long-drawn battle in front of us. Hence the combating strategies will also have to be sustainable and may evolve from say, cluster monitoring at present to a more broad-based targeted monitoring soon,’’ suggests the company.It has assigned a relative risk score to each 1 sq km grid based on some criteria. These grids or micro-zones are also mapped to municipal wards as defined by local authorities or census definitions. In essence, localities within cities which are densely populated, connected with multiple other localities and have several points of the congregation are most likely to be susceptible to the contagion.“We believe it could be a sustainable way for authorities to combat this crisis in the long term,’’ said the company. All the data has been extracted through satellite imagery, location data and government records.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/micro-zoning-can-control-next-wave-of-covid-epidemic-77518

28-04-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus: India, China bury rapid test kit fiasco||India and China have moved on to other forms of cooperation to combat COVID-19 after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) cancelled orders of Chinese preliminary testing kits that were allegedly defective.The cancellation also put an end to the controversy over an opportunistic markup, of over 60 per cent, by two Indian companies which imported the rapid testing kits for supplying them to ICMR. It was a court case between the two warring companies that brought this huge markup to public view.Sources said India will continue to depend on China heavily, despite indigenous attempts to manufacture inexpensive rapid-testing kits, ventilators and personal protection equipment (PPE).To remain relevant to global relief efforts, through its position as the primary supplier of COVID antibiotics and preventive medicine, India will have to depend on China—as it supplies almost 90 per cent of the raw material.The Chinese embassy here had tried to salvage the reputation of the two suppliers of antibody rapid test kits by putting forth a variety of explanations after there were embarrassing variations in tests. India, however, is not too worried after energetic diplomatic footwork enabled a South Korean company to begin the production of rapid testing kits in India. The production capacity of the company, SD Biosensor, can be ramped up to produce five lakh kits every week if the need arises.The Chinese, after a spirited fight-back, where they first suggested that Indians are at fault and then mooted consultations with the manufacturers, may have fallen silent because similar reports have erupted from other countries, suggested sources.Beijing has claimed that the rapid testing kits supplied by two Chinese companies and certified by a Chinese regulator received no adverse reports except those from India. However, sources referred to Congress leader Shashi Tharoor’s compilation of the list of countries that have expressed dissatisfaction with Chinese kits to combat this claim. According to Tharoor, the kits had a 30 per cent accuracy in the badly-hit Spain, 35 per cent in Turkey and 40 per cent in the Philippines, while Italy and the Netherlands have stopped testing with them.Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong, however, took exception to brand all Chinese products as faulty."Regarding the current issue occurred, we hope the Indian side could respect China’s goodwill and sincerity, strengthen communication timely with relevant Chinese companies based on facts, and resolve it reasonably and properly,’’ she said, indicating that Beijing has stepped out of the picture, leaving the issue to be resolved between ICMR and the two companies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-india-china-bury-rapid-test-kit-fiasco-77516
28-04-2020||Lucknow||BJP MLA in UP caught on video telling people not to buy vegetables from Muslim vendors||Bharatiya Janata Party’s Uttar Pradesh president Swatandradev Singh on Tuesday directed the saffron party’s disciplinary committee to serve a notice to a legislator who asked people not to buy vegetables from Muslim vegetable vendors.Speaking to some news channels, Deoria’s Barhaj assembly segment MLA Suresh Tiwari has seen on camera defending his statement audaciously asking: “Did I say anything wrong?” Last week Deoria’s representative Tiwari’s divisive statement had gone viral on the social media asking people not to buy vegetables from ‘Miya’ (Muslims). His statement had received severe nationwide criticism.In the previous 14-second clip he was heard saying: “Keep one thing in mind. I am telling everyone openly. There is no need to buy vegetables from ‘Miyas’ (Muslims).”He was clearly urging people to economically boycott Muslims asking people not to buy vegetables from Muslim vendors.Worst still is a new clip on the social media on Tuesday where an unapologetic Tiwari is actually defending his previous statement.“I was in my constituency and I was interacting with a group of 10-12 people. We started having a conversation over the lockdown. I was told that Muslim vendors selling vegetables were spitting on them. Therefore, I told them that I cannot do anything but they should avoid buying from such vendors to make sure that they do not get corona virus. When people are seeking direction what to do... what should a MLA say? Did I say anything wrong? Why make such a big issue out of it?” he asked news channels in the fresh video.The district police chief Shri Pati Mishra could not be contacted regarding any criminal action against the MLA. The police PRO expressed ignorance about the clip. Despite repeated appeals from the state government and police to avoid believing rumors, there have been several incidents of Muslim vendors being targeted in various districts.In Lakhimpur Khiri a Muslim fruit vendor was attacked on Monday as he was accused of spitting on the watermelons before selling. The police team rescued him from the angry crowd.Later, the Khiri police issued a statement saying that after a probe and questioning the locals’ allegations against the vendor, Chand Ali was found to be “false and baseless”.It was only last week that Prime Minister Modi had declared that COVID-19 pandemic affects everyone equally.“COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language, or border before striking. Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together,” Prime Minister Modi’s office had tweeted last week.Suresh Tiwari, BJP MLA of Barhaj constituency of UP is instructing people to not to buy vegetables from Muslim. pic.twitter.com/D6s9Nzf5P8||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-mla-in-up-caught-on-video-telling-people-not-to-buy-vegetables-from-muslim-vendors-77512
28-04-2020||New Delhi||SC asks Centre to consider adopting ‘one nation, one ration card’ scheme during lockdown||The Supreme Court has asked the Centre to consider the feasibility of ‘temporarily’ adopting the ‘one nation, one ration card’ scheme during the ongoing coronavirus lockdown period to enable the migrant workers and economically weaker sections (EWS) get subsidised foodgrain.The central government scheme is scheduled to be launched in June this year.A bench of Justices N V Ramana, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and B R Gavai, in an order passed on Monday said:  “We direct the Union of India to consider whether it is feasible for it to implement the said Scheme at this stage or not and take appropriate decision in this regard keeping in view the present circumstances”.The top court disposed of a plea filed by advocate Reepak Kansal, who sought the launching of the scheme,  for the benefit of migrant workers, beneficiaries and citizens of other states stranded in different places due to the nationwide lockdown.“The petitioner seeks the indulgence of this court to protect and safeguard right of migrant labourers /beneficiaries / citizens of other States/ UT/ tourists to get their entitlement of subsidized foodgrain and benefits of government scheme etc introduced during the epidemic of coronavirus and nationwide lockdown in the State / UTs even if they are not in their respective home State / Union Territory by way of a mandamus to the concerned authorities to temporarily adopt One Nation One Umbrella Policy during the epidemic of corona due to absence of scheme of One Nation One Rashan Card,” the plea said.He also sought direction to authorities for ensuring migrant labourers who are at present staying in rented premises or in transit camps do not go hungry for want of local identity cards or any identity cards.Kansal claimed that States and Union Territories have been giving preferences to its respective citizens and voters and denying benefits of subsidized grains / foods /shelter/ medical facilities to the migrants labourers or citizens of other states/ UTs due to absence of local identity proof like Ration card/residential proof or voter card even during the unprecedented nationwide lockdown due to epidemic of COVID-19.“The scheme...announced by Central Government is about to start...

We are now manufacturing PPEs and have over a hundred manufacturers in the country. We are making 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh PPEs every day in the country".Harsh Vardhan also said that the whole country has been waiting very anxiously for the contribution of the Indian scientists whether it is about the discovery of new drug or successful trial of drugs which are used at present, or discovery of a vaccine or indigenous testing kits.According to the Health Minister pre-lockdown the doubling rate of the cases in India was around 3 days but for the last 14 days it had been 8.2 and for the last 7 days, it was 10.2. In the last 3 days, it is 10.9."This is very significant progress," said the Health Minister."A hundred and 29 districts where there are a significant number of cases, around 15 or less, we call them hotspots. These are the places where we are focusing our approach on cluster containment and disease outbreak containment strategies. There is a house to house survey in five kilometres area. Right now in the last 24 hours, there are 16 states which have not reported any new case," Harsh Vardhan said.Lauding the efforts of the Department of Biotechnology, Harsh Vardhan said that it is supporting a number of companies in research and vaccine development."We have made quite progress in that direction," said he, adding, "Genome sequencing activities have started on thousand viruses in biotechnology. Indigenous antibody test kits and RT-PCR kits are doing an exemplary job and ICMR ramped up their testing capacity. Right now we have our indigenous kits."The Health Minister stressed, "We all have to see that we deliver results which could be converted into the useful implementable solution for the people of India."

28-04-2020||Washington||India engaged with countries including US for coordinated response to COVID-19: Envoy Sandhu||India remains engaged with other countries including the US and Israel for a coordinated response to the coronavirus pandemic, the Indian envoy here has said.India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu, in a conversation with the influential American Jewish Committee (AJC), said that the Indian leadership is in close contact with its friends and ready to step forward to help them.“As we battle this pandemic, India remains engaged with other countries including the United States and Israel in an effort to partner towards a coordinated response.“Whether it is the form of ensuring the supply of essential medicines or sharing expertise and knowhow or joint scientific collaborations, India stands ready to battle this pandemic shoulder to shoulder with our friends,” Sandhu said in his interaction with the AJC.As a country of 1.3 billion people, India faces unique challenges in combating this common enemy, he said.India has so far managed to slow the initial spread of the contagion since the first confirmed case in the country on January, 30.India, he said, has taken preemptive measures under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to enforce a total lockdown.Sandhu said that India and the US are global strategic partners with a multifaceted relationship which encompasses almost every aspect of human endeavour.“Our defence and energy partnership has grown over the years as has our scientific collaboration. As democracies with shared values and global strategic partners, we are in a unique position today, walking together to combat the COVID-19 crisis,” he said.Jason Isaacson, AJC Associate Executive Director for Policy and Managing Director of Government, said that the US is deeply indebted to the Indian healthcare workers who are such an important part of the health system of the country.The Indian medical device industry, the pharmaceutical industry continues to be essential, not only in India but to the world, he said.The world, he noted, has come to rely on these devices and protective equipment and pharmaceuticals from India, he said.Sandhu said India has assumed the leadership role in “this very, very deadly” crisis.“We took not only proactive measures in India, but we also took active measures in the region and the world at large,” the Indian envoy added.The deadly coronavirus, which originated in China late last year, has so far killed more than two lakh people and infected over three million globally. The largest number of them are in the US: more than 56,000 deaths and over one million infections.In India, mainly because of the early and aggressive preventive measures, the fatalities have remained comparatively low at 934 and infections at 29,435.

We are in Qatar. It is my grandmother's60th birthday on Sunday. Can you send a birthday cake to her?.It's her 60th birthday and the family was supposed to come to Kerala, But due to lockdown we are stuck here", she told the police personnel.The cops also spoke to her parents and promised to deliver the cake the following day.On Sunday morning, Jancey and her husband were shocked at seeing the policemen."But we told them there was nothing to worry and that we had dropped in to deliver a birthday cake to her", police said.The police personnel also had a video chat with Lenna, showed her grandmother with the cake and the child was overjoyed, they said. On the request of the parents, who are stuck in Italy due to the lockdown, cops recently handed over a cake to three-year-old Marya Rose at Mala in Thrissur district.Police sources told PTI they had another unusual request for help from a person who was abroad saying that her elderly parents were living alone in the state capital and had found a serpent.A team was immediately sent with a snake catcher, and the nocturnal visitor was caught and taken off, much to the relief of the elderly couple.Another plea was from a man from Kannur who urgently needed "Marimani Thylam" (an Ayurvedic pain reliever), which was also provided, the sources said.Policemen have also been active in spreading the message of hand washing and social distancing.

28-04-2020||New Delhi||Professionals complain of stress, insomnia, anxiety after prolonged work from home||Insomnia, backaches, restlessness, stress and anxiety are among the side-effects people are facing from prolonged work from home as the country entered the fifth week of the lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.Many companies and firms shut office operations after the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 25. Initially imposed for 21 days, the lockdown was extended to May 3 as the number of Covid-19 cases increased in the country.Suresh Sharma, a Delhi-based techie, said he spends most of his time either in front of his laptop screen or on his mobile phone, sometimes hours at a stretch."I was initially enjoying working from home. However, with the passage of time, I realised it had taken a toll on my health. While working in my office space, I would be attending meetings and interacting with people. But, now, absolutely everything is online," he said.Sharma says back problems have cropped up and headaches have become frequent.For Geeta Malhotra, a techie based in Bengaluru, work from home has not only blurred the line separating her personal and professional life, but has also made her insomniac."I am eating whenever I want. Sometimes two meals a day, sometimes four times a day. The little walking I used to do has also stopped. I have put on four kg of weight since the lockdown and I am having trouble sleeping at night so much that I have been sleeping for less than four hours," she said.Like Sharma, she, too, complained of suffering from headaches frequently.Several large IT companies, according to estimates, have 90 to 95 per cent of its employees working from home.Health experts have advised people to practise meditation and do physical exercises to keep the mind and body fit.People should also use this opportunity to pursue their hobbies to de-stress, they said.Clinical psychologist at Paras Hospital in Gurugram, Preeti Singh, said people might be experiencing these issues as they are not getting enough opportunity for physical activity. This is also sometimes due to lack of motivation or anxiety, she said."Workload has increased along with responsibilities at home, this has left people exhausted. Insomnia might have become a problem as many are tensed over job security," Singh said.Shailaja S, who works in Bengaluru as an architect, said she had been having "anxiety attacks and nightmares"."When at work, I would see my colleagues, go on coffee or lunch breaks, but now I am sitting at home the whole day working," she said."I am always restless, I keep checking my phone assuming there is a message from office. There is no respite even after working hours are over, as I keep getting work messages," said Shailaja.Rahul Kumar, a consultant with a Gurugram-based multinational company, said his body posture had worsened and he is suffering from severe back pain, restlessness and anxiety."In the first two weeks, I was relaxed but as time passed I have been restless and anxious. My diet and exercise routine have all been hit. Now all I do is sit in front of the computer and work in my room," Kumar said.Some health experts said distressing news on the novel coronavirus pandemic is also taking a toll on the mental health of people.Pankaj Gupta, president, Indian Institute of Health Management Research University, Jaipur, said distressing information related to the coronavirus is making people scared and worried about their and their family's health."We know that good mental health promotes good physical health; therefore, involve yourself in dancing, yoga, gardening that brings in positive thoughts and happiness," he said."Practising meditation early in the morning and devoting time to reading and spiritual activities will generate positive vibes around you and your loved ones. Keeping the house clean and bright with lights, walking on the roof will help them stay mentally healthy during this tough time," Gupta said.Shanu Srivastava, a senior psychologist at Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, advised people to limit news consumption on Covid-19.He said frequent updates on the pandemic are creating anxiety and insomnia in people.The government has launched a toll-free helpline number – 080461 10007 -- for people who may face any mental health issue due to the ongoing countrywide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus.In a document 'Minding our minds during the COVID-19 pandemic', the Union Health Ministry said staying at home can be quite nice for some time, but can also be boring and restricting.It advised people to stay busy and distract themselves from negative emotions by listening to music, reading, watching an entertaining programme on television, pursuing hobbies and doing simple indoor exercises.The deadly coronavirus disease has claimed 934 lives in the country, and currently, there are 21,632 active cases, according to the health ministry. On the bright side, 6,868 people have been cured of the infection. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/professionals-complain-of-stress-insomnia-anxiety-after-prolonged-work-from-home-77488

28-04-2020||---||India , China among top 3 military spenders||New Delhi, April 27According to a Swedish research institute, India and China have emerged among the top three military spenders of the world. The US, expectedly, leads the pack with $732 billion and accounts for 38 per cent of global military spending.Russia ($ 65.1 billion spend) and Saudi Arabia ($ 61.9 billion) are at the fourth and fifth spots, respectively. Pakistan, at the 24th spot, is down from the 19th spot it occupied last year.The details were released on Monday morning by Swedish think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Titled ‘Trends in world military expenditure, 2019’, the annual report stated, “India spent $71.1 billion on defence in 2019 which was 2.4 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP)." India was at the fourth spot last year."The SIPRI report states, “India’s expenditure has grown by 259% over the 30-year (1990-2019) period and by 37 per cent over the decade (2010-19).” However, its military burden fell from 2.7% of the GDP in 2010 to 2.4% in 2019.“India’s tensions and rivalry with both Pakistan and China are among the major drivers for its increased military spending,” said the report quoting Siemon T Wezeman, SIPRI’s Senior Researcher.China’s military expenditure reached $261 billion in 2019, a 5.1% increase compared with 2018. “China’s military expenditure has increased continuously since 1994 (for 25 consecutive years),” the report said. The growth in its military spending has closely matched the country’s economic growth. Between 2010 and 2019, China’s military burden remained almost unchanged, at 1.9 per cent of its GDP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-among-top-3-military-spenders-77429

28-04-2020|| ||SC seeks Centre’s response on shifting migrant workers||New Delhi, April 27“This institution is not hostage to government,” the Supreme Court said on Monday as it sought reply from the Centre on a plea seeking direction to authorities to allow migrant workers across the country to return home after conducting coronavirus tests.The remark came after advocate Prashant Bhushan told the court that the government’s view is being blindly considered without verifying it, while fundamental rights of people especially migrant workers are not being enforced.A Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana questioned Bhushan, appearing for petitioners Jagdeep S Chhokar and Gaurav Jain, as to why should the court hear him, if he does not have faith in the system.Clarifying that he never said that he has no faith in this system, Bhushan added he could be wrong but similar opinion is expressed by some retired judges.The SC asked the Centre to spell out if it had any plans to shift lakhs of migrant workers, stranded due to lockdown, to their native places.Citing certain media reports, Bhushan alleged that more than 90% of the stranded migrant workers were not receiving wages, ration and other essential items.However, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta vehemently opposed Bhushan’s submission, saying the reports were wrong and that he was not the only person worried about plight of migrants.Sending migrant workers back to their villages would defeat the very purpose of lockdown as it might lead to spread of Covid-19 in rural areas, Mehta argued. The government was already dealing with the matter in consultation with states, he said.Restriction of movement of migrant workers and their confinement in the city of their migration in a shelter homes violated their rights to freedom of movement and right to live with human dignity guaranteed under Article 19 and Article 21 of the Constitution respectively, the petitioners contended.During hearing of another PIL, the Centre had recently told the top court that close to seven lakh migrant workers had been accommodated in more than 21,000 temporary shelters across India and they were being given food and medical facilities.Can’t bring back students, Nitish tells PMPatna: During PM’s digital meet, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar informed Narendra Modi the state was scrupulously adhering to the central guidelines on the lockdown, and made it clear that it would not be possible to bring back students from places like Kota until the directions were suitably altered.

Instead, it has put the burden on employers to pay full wages,” the petitioners said.Scribes’ plea against pay cut, job lossNew Delhi: The SC has asked the Centre to respond to a petition seeking directions to media houses not to sack journalists and non-journalists working with them during the Covid lockdown. The petition, filed jointly by three unions, states a large number of journalists had been sacked or were facing salary cut.

It also asked states to return the kits for further return to suppliers.ICMR's statement on cancellation of the procurement order for five lakh antibody test kits imported from Chinese firm Wondfo through an Indian importer and distributor came this evening after the Congress alleged a scam in the matter and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to order a probe besides making all Covid medical equipment procurement public.After Congress alleged profiteering by the Indian importer of the kits and the distributor, terming exploitation during the pandemic an insult to the people, the ICMR said the government had not lost any money as no advance had been paid to Rare Metabolics, the Indian bidder that bagged the rapid kit supply contract.The ICMR cancelled the order today after its chief Balram Bhargava had a meeting with PM Modi. Later, the council wrote to all states to only use RT-PCR kits to detect virus. "The ICMR has again conducted quality checks on these kits in field conditions. Based on scientific assessment of their performance, the order of Wondfo along with another make found underperforming has been cancelled," it said.The ICMR also acknowledged its first attempt at procuring kits directly from Chinese firms had failed.Earlier, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the country would not pardon profiteers in Covid times.

Our ability to completely flatten the curve depends on our rapid success in these districts.” Of the 27 districts, the maximum — six — are in Rajasthan and include Jaipur, Ahmed, Bharatpur, Jodhpur, Kota and Tonk.Gujarat’s Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodara; Kerala’s Kasargod and Kannur; MP’s Indore, Bhopal; Maharashtra’s Mumbai, Pune and Thane are part of these 27 high focus hotspots.Other districts are Guntur and Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh; Hyderabad in Telangana; Agra, Gautam Budh Nagar and Lucknow in UP; Chennai, Coimbatore and Tiruppur in Tamil Nadu; Bengaluru in Karnataka and Delhi state. In UP, the maximum cases are in Agra (22.5%).Meanwhile, 16 districts as of today are among the areas that haven’t reported an infection in 28 days.

28-04-2020||---||Focus on economy, hotspots: PM||New Delhi, April 27Emphasising the need to go in for a graded exit from the current state of lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday told the Chief Ministers the key to managing the spread of Covid-19 requires keeping an eye on the economy and consolidating the gains made during the past month.Reminding that the threat from the virus was far from over, he said constant vigil, social distancing and face masks should become a norm. In his fourth interaction with the CMs on management of the spread of the global pandemic, PM Modi underscored the lockdown yielded positive results with the country managing to save thousands of lives and faring better than countries with lesser population.With the second and extended lockdown scheduled to end on Sunday, a majority of the Chief Ministers wanted the Centre to take a call on the future of lockdown. PM Modi said it was important for the states to enforce guidelines strictly in the hotspots, i.e. the red zone areas.The effort should be directed towards converting the red zones into orange and thereafter to green zones. At present, some 170 districts in the country are in the red zone, requiring strict containment protocols.With states like Telangana already prolonging the extended lockdown till May 7 and few others favouring extension with Odisha seeking one more month, the Centre has to work on a road map that balances the need to restart the engines that power the economy while managing to limit the spread of Covid-19.While a calibrated exit plan was unrolled with the government permitting activities across limited sectors since April 20, the PM also gave a suggestion on a new approach. “We have to be brave and bring in reforms that touch the lives of common citizens,” he said, suggesting that people associated with universities can devise ways to fight the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/focus-on-economy-hotspots-pm-77260
