20-04-2020||---||Sibal, Tankha write to Prez against one-man Shivraj govt in MP amid COVID-19||New Delhi, April 20As the Shivraj Singh Chouhan Government in Madhya Pradesh continues to function without a Cabinet during COVID19 pandemic, Congress leaders and senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Vivek Tankha have complained to President Ram Nath Kovind against its alleged “undemocratic and unconstitutional functioning”.Chouhan had taken oath as Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh on March 23 after the Kamal Nath-led Congress resigned without facing a floor test ordered by the Supreme Court in the wake of resignations made by 22 rebel Congress MLAs loyal to Jyotiraditya Scindia.In a letter to President Kovind, they complained that even after almost a month, Chouhan failed to form a Cabinet.The two Rajya Sabha MPs specifically mentioned the promulgation of two ordinances relating to appropriation of funds amid the pandemic on the aid and advice of Chief Minister Chouhan alone as there was no council of ministers in the state.‘The Madhya Pradesh Finance Ordinance, 2020’ and ‘The Madhya Pradesh Appropriation (Vote On Account) Ordinance, 2020’ authorise the Madhya Pradesh Government to seek an additional loan of Rs 4,443 crore and to withdraw Rs 10,00,66,74,81,000 from the Consolidated Fund of the State for the current financial year.The duo said such an exercise went against the requirements of Article 164 of the Constitution—according to which the Governor is mandates to act on the aid and advice of Council of Ministers.“In the absence of any discussion and deliberations in the Council of Ministers, as none exists there can be no Vote-on-Account. The whim and fancy of a one-man non-government, unknown to law, cannot be the basis of taking recourse to Article 213 of the constitution, the Ordinance making power,” the letter read.Sibal and Tankha requested the President to direct the State of Madhya Pradesh to constitute a Council of Ministers; consider and pass the Vote-on-Account by following settled constitutional procedures; and withdraw the impugned ordinances.Else, President’s Rule should be imposed in the state, if necessary, after summoning a report from the Governor of Madhya Pradesh, they demanded.Taking such “momentous fiscal decisions”, required collective application of mind and a sense of collective responsibility in the cabinet was essential, they submitted.“A decision to undertake transactions involving huge sums of money, without a cabinet in political hara-kiri,” they contended.The Congress leaders also attacked Chouhan for setting up a Task Force of senior BJP leaders to advise the state government to deal with the pandemic, terming it an undemocratic exercise of power.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sibal-tankha-write-to-prez-against-one-man-shivraj-govt-in-mp-amid-covid-19-73716

Please do not believe in rumours,” he said.According to the police the three, Swami Kalpvruksha Giri (70), Swami Sushil Giri (35) and their driver Nilesh Telgade, were travelling from Kandivali in Mumbai to Gujarat to attend a funeral when they were lynched in the village close to Dadra Nagar and Haveli. Localofficials say most of the attackers were tribals from the nearby villages.Thackeray scotched rumours of a communal angle behind the attack. ”There is no communal angle behind the lynching,” he said. The Chief Minister added that the sadhus and their drivers were trying to drive into the union territory when they were stopped at the border by the police.The occupants of the vehicle then tried to enter Gujarat from a rural road passing through the village when they were attacked by the local villagers.Later in the evening, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad blamed leftist organisations active in Palghar district for the attacks on the sadhus.Forest officials and local police personnel who tried to protect the sadhus were attacked by the villagers. One police vehicle was smashed and rolled over by the villagers in the video footage circulated on social media.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-100-held-for-lynching-three-in-maharashtras-palghar-73703
20-04-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: PIL demands full automatic refund on air tickets cancellations||A PIL in the Supreme Court has demanded full automatic refund of money for tickets booked for flights during the COVID-19 lockdown, alleging that airlines were violating Ministry of Civil Aviation’s guidelines on the issue.Filed by Pravasi Legal Cell—an NGO—the PIL said both domestic and international airlines were violating the ministry’s order which obliged them to fully refund amount for tickets cancelled on account of COVID-19 lockdown.Pointing out that instead of full refund, airlines were providing a credit shell, valid up to one year, the PIL submitted that failure to refund full amount collected for tickets owing to cancellation of flights due to restrictions imposed by the government to prevent spread of COVID-19 violated DGCA’s Civil Aviation Requirement, 2008.It referred to the ministry’s April 16 Office Memorandum which directed all airline operators to refund full amount collected for all tickets booked during the first phase of the lockdown between March 25 and April 14 both for domestic and international bookings.This was also applicable to cancellation of tickets booked during the first phase of lockdown for travel during the second phase of the lockdown between April 15 and May 3), the OM stated.Airlines were not allowed to levy any cancellation charges, it said.Pointing out that OM only asks airlines to refund money for only tickets booked during lockdown period, the NGO said it “leaves out the vast majority of passengers who had booked tickets before the flights were banned and thus indirectly approves the practice of the airlines providing Credit Shell for booking effected before the lockdown, though the same clearly violates the refund rules of the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)”.Terming the April 16 OM as ambiguous, the petitioner demanded that there should be automatic immediate refund on flight cancellations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-pil-demands-full-automatic-refund-on-air-tickets-cancellations-73691

20-04-2020||New Delhi||Asymptomatic, young and healthy may not surface in contact tracing, testing: Health expert||As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country jump past 17,000 with 543 deaths, a worry associated with the spread of viral infection is emerging - the asymptomatic cases or people who do not show symptoms of the infection may not be identified through contact tracing and tests.Speaking to IANS, Prof K Srinath Reddy, President, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) said, "At the community level, the truly asymptomatic positives can become spreaders at least for a short period. Usually they are young and healthy. We cannot cast a net in the ocean of the general population to catch all of them. Contact tracing and testing helps but may still miss some asymptomatic positives."He insisted that asymptomatic cases can be true positive or false positive on initial testing. "If repeat antigen testing and later antibody testing also sequentially indicate viral exposure and immune response with recovery, a true positive label becomes very strongly evidence based. This clarifies the position for the individual," he added.Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has consistently maintained that it is not possible to test everybody. The ICMR said in India, there are 24 tests for one positive and out of these 23 tests are negative, but it still conducts tests on them whereas in Japan, 11.7 persons are tested, to detect one positive case, which is highest in foreign countries."In Italy, 6.7 people are tested to find one positive case, in the US its 5.3 and in the UK its 3.4. Our population is over 130 crore but everyone is not vulnerable," said the ICMR.Prof. Reddy insisted that is why social distancing, personal hygiene and special precautions to protect the elderly and persons with co-morbidities must continue long after the lockdown is lifted.Dr Manoj Goel, Director, Pulmonology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute said the reason for asymptomatic patients is that initially the infection sets in the throat and nasopharynx where the virus multiplies and virus load increases. During this period the patient does not have any symptoms as the virus is multiplying but at the same time this person is able to pass on the infection to others."Infectivity starts on an average 4 days before the onset of the symptoms and peaks just on the day the patient gets the first symptom. During this period the patient cannot be identified till his test is done. The only way to identify these patients is to do mass screening of individuals who are living in the hot spot zones and high risk clusters and then this can be taken further to mass screening at a larger scale," said Dr Goel.Earlier, during the month in a press conference, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Health Ministry, had said "We are actually dealing with a very huge challenge along with the rest of the world. In this particular infectious disease, not only people who are symptomatic, but even asymptomatic persons as a carrier may pass on the infection." The Health Ministry was responding to a situation in which a patient had gone to a hospital for some other disease, got in touch with medical professionals and healthcare staff and ended up infecting them with COVID-19. Later, it was realised that the patient was a carrier of the coronavirus infection. It was first recognised in China in January when it was not known what the trend was.

A compassionate and responsible government will and can find the resources to put monies in Jan Dhan accounts; pension accounts of old age, widows and disabled; and PM Kisan. The question is not how fines will be generated. Funds will be generated,” Ramesh said.Ramesh also said the Government was sleeping and was busy destabilising the MP Government before imposing the lockdown.“It is a reality that the PM didn’t act with seriousness to deal with the situation. The fact is the country realised only after March 24 lockdown that there was a major crisis at hand. The Government knew since January what was happening. But I don’t want to go into history right now and we did not discuss these issues today in our meeting. Today is not the time for blame game. That we can do later. Today we discussed measures to be adopted for migrant labourers, poor and MSME sector during lockdown,” Ramesh said.He said the Congress was working on a comprehensive revival plan for MSME sector, the second largest employer in the country and will submit specific suggestions to the government.Ramesh said the Government has taken some welfare measures but those are not adequate.“We will make suggestions and hope the Government takes our suggestions in the spirit of positive cooperation,” Ramesh said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-seeks-rs-7-500-in-each-jan-dhan-pension-pm-kisan-73686
20-04-2020||London||Vijay Mallya loses UK High Court appeal, clock set for extradition to India||Vijay Mallya on Monday lost a UK High Court appeal against his extradition, a major turning point that brings India closer to getting back the embattled liquor tycoon wanted in the alleged fraud and money laundering charges amounting to Rs 9,000 crore.The dismissal of the High Court appeal effectively clears the decks for Mallya’s extradition to India to face the charges in the Indian courts, with 14 days for him to apply for permission to appeal to the UK Supreme Court.If he does apply, the UK Home Office would wait for the outcome of that appeal. But if he does not, under the India-UK Extradition Treaty, it would then be expected to formally certify the court order for the 64-year-old Mallya to be extradited to India within 28 days.“We have held there is a prima facie case both of misrepresentation and of conspiracy, and thus there is also a prima facie case of money laundering,” the High Court concluded.This marks a major turning point for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) case against the businessman, who has been on bail in the UK since his arrest on an extradition warrant in April 2017.The former Kingfisher Airlines boss had appealed to the higher court against his extradition ordered by the Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London in December 2018, and then signed off by then UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid in February last year, at a three-day hearing in February this year.Lord Justice Stephen Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing, the two-member bench at the Royal Courts of Justice in London presiding over the appeal, dismissed it in a judgement handed down this week remotely due to the current coronavirus lockdown.“We consider that while the scope of the prima facie case found by the SDJ [Senior District Judge Emma Arbuthnot] is in some respects wider than that alleged by the Respondent in India (CBI and ED), there is a prima facie case which, in seven important respects, coincides with the allegations in India,” the judges noted.They detail seven main points around which they based their decision to concur with Arbuthnot’s extradition order.Based on the documents setting out the Indian government’s case against Mallya, the judges said they found that the loans in question were disbursed as the result of a conspiracy between the named conspirators and that they were made despite Kingfisher Airline’s weak financials, negative net worth and low credit rating.“The Appellant [Mallya] was party to false representations to induce the loans that funds would be inducted by way of unsecured loans, global depository receipts and equity,” they note.“The Appellant was party to false representations about inward investment, an exaggerated brand value, misleading growth forecasts, inconsistent business plans.The Appellant’s dishonest intention not to repay the loans is shown by his later conduct in trying to avoid the personal and corporate guarantees,” they said.Mallya’s legal team had sought to challenge the Indian government’s case on multiple grounds, including whether their client would be safe at Barrack 12 in Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai where he is to be held on extradition.Most of the grounds had already been dismissed by the High Court, with permission granted to appeal only on one ground -- challenging the Indian government’s prima facie case against Mallya of fraudulent intentions in acquiring bank loans.“Mallya has 14 days to apply for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. If he doesn’t appeal – removal within 28 days thereafter. If he does appeal, we wait for the outcome on that application,” said a spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which represented the Indian authorities in the UK courts.Representatives from the ED and the CBI had been present in court in February during the three-day hearing, at the end of which Mallya had once again reiterated his message for the Indian banks to take back 100 per cent of the principal amount owed to them.“I am saying, please banks take your money. The ED is saying no, we have a claim over these assets. So, the ED on the one side and the banks on the other are fighting over the same assets… What all they are doing to me for the last four years is totally unreasonable,” he said at the time.Mallya has been based in the UK since March 2016 and remains on bail on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard in April 2017.In her verdict at the end of a year-long extradition trial in December 2018, Judge Emma Arbuthnot had ruled that the “flashy” billionaire had a “case to answer” in the Indian courts.India and the UK have an Extradition Treaty signed in 1992 and in force since November 1993. So far, only one successful extradition has taken place from the UK to India under the treaty, that of Samirbhai Vinubhai Patel, who was sent back to India in 2016 to face trial in connection with his involvement in the post-Godhra riots in 2002.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vijay-mallya-loses-uk-high-court-appeal-clock-set-for-extradition-to-india-73685
20-04-2020||New Delhi||India's new FDI norms violate WTO's principle of free trade: Chinese Embassy||India's new policy for foreign direct investment (FDI) from specific countries violate WTO's principle of non-discrimination and are against the general trend of free trade, a Chinese embassy spokesperson said on Monday.The impact of the policy, introducing "additional barriers", was clear on Chinese investors, the official said, adding that India's action was also against the consensus arrived at the G20 to realise a free, fair and non-discriminatory environment for investment.Last week, India made it mandatory to have prior clearance by the government for foreign investments from countries that share land border with India to curb "opportunistic takeovers" of domestic firms following the coronavirus pandemic.Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong said China hoped that India would revise the "relevant discriminatory practices" and treat investments from different countries equally while fostering an "open, fair and equitable" business environment.India's decision to tighten norms for FDI came amid reports of China eyeing to takeover several Indian entities following fall in their valuation following economic downturn in the wake of the pandemic."The additional barriers set by Indian side for investors from specific countries violate WTO's principle of non-discrimination, and go against the general trend of liberalisation and facilitation of trade and investment," Chinese embassy Spokesperson Ji Rong said in a statement.She said China hoped that India would revise the "relevant discriminatory practices" and treat investments from different countries equally while fostering an "open, fair and equitable" business environment."Chinese investment has driven the development of India's industries, such as mobile phone, household electrical appliances, infrastructure and automobile, creating a large number of jobs in India, and promoting mutual beneficial and win-win cooperation," Ji said.The spokesperson said China's cumulative investment in India has exceeded USD 8 billion, noting it is far more than the total investments by countries sharing border with India.      She said India's new policy will make it difficult for companies from countries sharing land border with India, including China, to invest in India, adding decisions by companies to invest depends on a country's economic fundamentals."Facing the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, countries should work together to create a favourable investment environment to speed up the resumption of companies' production and operation," she said.The ballooning trade deficit in China's favour has also been a major issue for India.The trade deficit in 2018, according to Chinese official data, climbed to USD 57.86 billion from USD 51.72 billion in 2017. India has been pressing China to import more Indian goods, especially pharmaceutical and IT products.

20-04-2020||BY Satya Prakash||Media at crossroads: It’s time to appoint Third Press Commission||The Press should be neither a mindless adversary nor an unquestioning ally of the government. Thirty-eight years after the Second Press Commission headed by Justice KK Mathew made this sagacious observation on the role of media in India, the fourth estate appears to be struggling to come up to the expectations of a democratic society it intends to serve.Both government and private bodies are finding fault with the style of functioning of the media. After the government requested the Supreme Court to direct the media to report its version on Covid19, Jamiat Ulma-i-Hind — an Islamic body in India — complained to it that media had been demonising the entire Muslim community over alleged spread of the pandemic due to Nizamuddin Markaz congregation of Tablighi Jamaat.Jamiat alleged that the media violated norms of journalistic conduct issued by the Press Council of India (PCI).While the top court asked the media to publish the government version on the Covid-19 crisis, it refused to gag the fourth estate on Jamiat Ulma-i-Hind’s plea. Instead, it asked the Islamic body to make the PCI a party to the case and posted it for hearing after two weeks.The PCI was prompt to point out that it had authority to deal with complaints against the print media alone and that it didn’t have jurisdiction over the electronic and social media. “Electronic media, TV news channels, social media i.e. WhatsApp/twitter/Facebook do not come under the jurisdiction of the Press Council of India,” the PCI clarified.The media industry has witnessed a phenomenal growth, particularly in the past two decades — thanks to the opening up of the Indian economy. According to the Registrar of Newspapers for India (RNI), the total number of registered publications as on March 31, 2018, stood at 1,18,239. This included 17,573 newspapers and 1,00,666 periodicals. The largest number of publications were registered in Hindi (47,989), followed by English (14,626).According to a Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) report, the total number of satellite TV channels went up from 524 in 2010 to 875 in 2018. Quite a good number of them are news channels. There are numerous online media outlets. Though a later entrant, social media platforms are hugely popular, particularly among the youth.The huge expansion of the TV news industry in a relatively short span of time has left it wanting on quality front due to dearth of trained professionals. TV channel debates are often marked by shrill and divisive comments. In many cases, the line between activism and journalism gets blurred and there are allegations of trial by media. Right to privacy — which was declared a fundamental right by the Supreme Court in 2017 — is often ignored, if not violated.Today, the media industry is at crossroads. A section of the media appears to have become a mindless adversary of the government, while another one an unquestioning ally. It’s becoming too much to expect objectivity. In short, the middle ground is missing.There is an inherent contradiction in their functioning. While performing their role to inform, educate and entertain; to set agenda for debate and; to act as watchdog for democracy, the media is supposed to run as a profit-making venture as well.But there is no point in blaming the media industry alone. Successive governments have failed to put in place the necessary regulatory framework. The PCI came into existence at a time when there was no electronic and social media. While the PCI is there to regulate the print media, there is no statutory regulator for the electronic and social media.Even with regard to complaints against the print media, the PCI is empowered only “to warn, admonish or censure the newspaper, the news agency, the editor or the journalist concerned or disapprove the conduct of the editor or the journalist” if indicted for offending against the standards of journalistic ethics or public taste or committing any professional misconduct.Be it RNI, PCI or the Working Journalists Act — all these were results of recommendations of the First Press Commission. The Second Press Commission said freedom and responsibility were complimentary and the media should be performing the role of constructive critique. While the advice still remains relevant, there is a need to set up the Third Press Commission to suggest regulatory framework for all sectors of the media industry in the changed circumstances. The sooner the better.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/media-at-crossroads-its-time-to-appoint-third-press-commission-73597

Marshall insists the lull in cricketing activity does not necessarily mean a drop in fixing approaches.“Covid-19 may have put a temporary stop on the playing of international and domestic cricket around the world but the corrupters are still active,” Marshall added. The ACU chief’s team is also aware that the drop in income due to absence of matches could also make some players more vulnerable to fixers. — Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/icc-corruptors-getting-in-touch-with-cricketers-73596

The test was carried out for delivery of Covid-19 items.The test proved the ability to operate at far-off ranges and beyond visual line of sight, meaning the drone was remotely controlled by either radar or another bigger UAV above it, and possibly the payload the drone could carry.Cargo successfully sent 25 km awayLoaded with medical cargo, autonomous drones successfully released the payload with pinpoint accuracy at Gobindgarh, Balluana and Malukpura villages in Abohar, located 25 km from the launch pointOn April 16, three such ‘Made in India’ drones were tested over three villages of Abohar in Fazilka district. The task was ‘anti-covid’ operations and to deliver essential supplies, including masks, liquid-sanitiser and medical canisters, sources confirmed.They said the Army coordinated these tests with the district administration, indicating operations can be carried out on a large scale by increasing the number of drones. The Army uses a few bigger drones for surveillance.The villages of Gobindgarh, Balluana and Malukpura are located at distance of up to 25 km from the launch point and fall beyond visual line of sight range from base. These tests would probably have been one of the first of its kind in India with a large medical delivery cargo carried by autonomous drones. Sources said the crucial part was releasing the payload with pinpoint accuracy and in good order.The entire operation did not involve any human contact at the village zone. Such a drone could be used to send supplies to small locality or a village without exposing the relief workers to people infected with the virus. It can also transport back crucial blood samples and other supplies from isolated places. The civil administration and elected members of the three villages participated in the trials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-tests-delivery-via-drones-in-punjab-73591

Since additional new activities outside the containment zones have been permitted in the consolidated revised guidelines with effect from April 20, 2020, these workers could be engaged in industrial, manufacturing, construction, farming and MGNREGA works.”As per the guidelines, the district-level officials have been asked to compulsorily register all labourers housed in relief camps and carry out skill mapping to find out their suitability for various kinds of works.“In the event, that a group of migrant workers wishes to return to places of work within the state where they are presently located, they would be screened and those who are asymptomatic would be transported to their respective places of work,” the guidelines said. The order, however, said there “shall be no movement of labour outside the state/UT from where they are currently located”.“During the journey by bus, it would be ensured that safe social distancing norms are followed and the buses used for transport are sanitised as per the guidelines of the health authorities,” it said, adding that the authorities “shall also provide for food and water, etc. for the duration of their journey”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shift-migrants-to-workplaces-mha-73538
