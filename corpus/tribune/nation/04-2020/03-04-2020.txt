03-04-2020||New Delhi||Report finds bulk video posts on social media to influence Muslim against COVID-19 precautions||Bulk videos are being posted on social media platforms like Tiktok, Youtube, and Twitter to influence Muslims in India against following safe practices to contain coronavirus infection, a report prepared by open-source intelligence and fact-checking IT firm Voyager Digital Investigations has claimed.According to the report, videos have been shot in both foreign locations and India and are being primarily posted on Chinese mobile video app Tiktok.“TikTok, a Chinese origin video-sharing app is being used as a primary medium to create and spread videos with religious instigations against health advisories and fake information regarding coronavirus. These videos are further shared on other platforms like Whatsapp, Twitter and Facebook,” the report said.The report submitted to India Cyber Crime Coordnination Centre, claims to have analysed over 30,000 videos in the last five days, said that most of these videos have been created with professional video editing softwares and originally uploaded accounts are being deleted after circulating them to other social media platforms.“Certain accounts peddling fake news among Muslims are promoting Pakistani religious leaders with terror links. A further investigation into the likely role of foreign actors needs to be investigated,” the report said.    The researchers found that Hindi and light Urdu are being used as a language, suggesting at India specific targeting of audience.   “Several of the videos appear to be shot in Pakistan and Middle East but audio in Hindi have been superimposed to create a Hindi video,” the report said.When contacted, a Tiktok spokesperson condemned any and all efforts to spread misinformation and fear regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.“We have been monitoring and systematically removing all content from our platform, including video, audio, and image that transgresses government advisories, as well as our own community guidelines.“We are suspending or banning accounts, and, where necessary, are reporting the accounts to relevant legal authorities to ensure public safety,” the spokesperson said.A Twitter spokesperson said that the company is using machine learning and automation to take a wide range of actions on potentially abusive and manipulative content.“To tackle misinformation related to COVID-19, we have broadened our definition of harm to address content that goes directly against guidance from authoritative sources with the intent to influence people into acting against recommended guidance, such as: ‘social distancing is not effective’,” the Twitter spokesperson said.    Twitter said it will continue to prioritise removing content when it has a clear call to action that could directly pose a risk to people’s health or well-being.The company said its automated systems have challenged more than 1.5 million accounts which were targeting discussions around COVID-19 with spammy or manipulative behaviours.“We will use both technology and our teams to help us identify and stop spammy behaviour and accounts.  We continue to remain vigilant,” the spokesperson said.Taking cognisance of fake news reports on the internet, the IT Ministry has asked all social media companies to immediately remove false news spreading misinformation about coronavirus from their platform.The Ministry of Electronics and IT issued an advisory on March 20 asking social media companies to inform their users about not posting false news that can create panic among the public and disturb social tranquillity.Voyager recommended “timely identification, flagging and timely removal of such content. Twitter and Tiktok must take timely measures against such disinformation when human lives are at risk”.

03-04-2020||Beijing||Coronavirus spreads by respiratory droplets and close contacts, not air: WHO||The virus that causes the COVID-19 disease is primarily transmitted through “respiratory droplets and close contacts”, and does not seem to stay long in the air, a recent WHO publication said.Respiratory infections can be transmitted through droplets of different sizes, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said.Droplet transmission occurs when you have close contact (within one metre) with a person who has respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, which may spread these potentially infectious droplets, typically 5-10 microns in size, to your body.Transmission may also occur by touching surfaces or objects in the immediate environment around the infected person, state-run China Daily quoted the WHO publication as saying.Airborne transmission is different from droplet transmission, as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei, which are generally considered to be the smaller particles of less than 5 microns in diameter, and which can remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than one metre, it said.In the context of COVID-19, airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances in which procedures or support treatments that generate aerosols are performed, such as intubation within a patient’s windpipe, disconnecting a patient from a ventilator, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).According to the publication, no cases of transmission by air were reported in an analysis of 75,465 patients with the coronavirus in China.Based on the current evidence, the WHO continues to recommend droplet and contact precautions for those people caring for COVID-19 patients. And it’s recommended that people take measures to prevent possible transmission by air when performing medical operations that produce aerosols, it added.A total of 1,002,159 COVID-19 cases have been reported across more than 175 countries and territories with 51,485 deaths reported so far, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

In this context, the president noted with concern the incidents of attacks on doctors, health workers and police personnel in some parts of the country,” it said.Affirming that people of the country have set an example by showing exemplary courage, discipline and solidarity in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, Kovind has expressed concern over two incidents, the gathering of migrant workers in Anand Vihar and the congregation of Tablighi Jamaat in Nizamuddin, both in Delhi, that caused a setback to the efforts, the statement said.Moreover, while ensuring that food and other essential items are made available to the needy, care has to be taken that no compromise is made on the question of social distancing, he added.Taking note of the problems faced by the homeless, the unemployed and the weaker sections of society during this crisis, the president said, “We will have to be extra sensitive towards their needs.” He invited other participants in the conference to deliberate upon the ways and means to ensure nobody remains hungry.Acknowledging that this was a big challenge, Kovind said he was confident the Governors will contribute to the efforts made at the central and state levels and involve all sections of society.President Kovind, along with Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, during the conference discussed ways to contribute to the measures taken by the government of India and the state governments in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.“Today’s conference was a sequel to the video conference held on March 27 with the Governors/LGs of select states/UTs on the issue,” the statement said.The Governors and LGs of 15 states/UTs had apprised the president and the vice-president about the situation in their states/UTs in the conference held on March 27.“Today, the Governors/LGs/Administrators of 21 remaining states/UTs briefed the president and the vice-president on COVID-19 related efforts,” it said.He wholeheartedly endorsed the Prime Minister’s appeal on Friday to all citizens to switch off lights in homes at 9 PM on Sunday and instead switch on their mobile flashlights, torches or lamps in an expression of people’s solidarity to fight against coronavirus.Kovind, however, cautioned people not to let their guard down and steadfastly adhere to the practice of social distancing.In his opening remarks, the president also noted that they had constructive discussions in the previous video conference held on March 27, and several useful suggestions had been made.Some of the praiseworthy initiatives of various states, which were noted in the previous conference, included enrolling retired doctors and medical students, using the expertise of psychologists, inviting the youth to volunteer, monitoring the situation with daily review meetings, setting up hunger help-lines, encouraging home delivery, using stadiums for relief works and quarantine facilities, and involving universities in spreading awareness, the statement said.The president referred to the previous conference in which the role of the Red Cross and other voluntary agencies in complementing the efforts of the government was discussed.He invited suggestions to involve and encourage maximum participation of the voluntary agencies as well as the private sector in meeting the humanitarian challenge.“In battling the pandemic, our efforts so far have been in the right direction, notwithstanding some incidents, and we are moving ahead with firm determination,” he said in his closing remarks.The president expressed appreciation of the fellow citizens for their patience and cooperation.                 He thanked the doctors and all officers and employees who have been serving society, the nation and humanity despite grave risk to their lives.Kovind also expressed his full confidence that the people of the country will continue the campaign against the pandemic with full alertness and firm determination.The vice president who conducted the conference laid emphasis on roping in volunteers of the Indian Red Cross Society, social organisations and private sector to mitigate the plight of the poor.He urged the Governors/Lt Governors and Administrators to persuade leaders from different walks to life to come forward and support the most vulnerable sections of society, particularly farmers, as the lockdown coincides with the harvesting season in many states.Naidu pointed out that though the central government and the state governments were taking adequate measures to alleviate people’s suffering, it would serve eternal human values for social elites to come forward and support the poor and most vulnerable sections in this crisis.

03-04-2020||---||Covid-19: UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet distressed over plight of migrants||New Delhi, April 3The plight of migrants in India after the sudden announcement of a nation-wide lockdown has caught the attention of the UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet who expressed “distress” but welcomed the subsequent measures to address their situation.“The lockdown in India represents a massive logistical and implementation challenge given the population size and its density and we all hope the spread of the virus can be checked. It is nonetheless important to ensure that measures in response to the Covid are neither applied in a discriminatory manner nor exacerbate existing inequalities and vulnerabilities,’’ she said.Following the announcement of the lockdown to limit the spread of Covid-19, many impoverished migrants were left without work and unable to pay for their rent and food. Without the ability to sustain themselves in urban centres and in light of the almost complete shutdown of public transportation, hundreds of thousands of migrant men, women and children were forced to walk hundreds of kilometres trying to reach their villages and home States. Some died making the journey. On March 29, the Union Home Ministry asked states to intercept migrants on their way home and quarantine them for two weeks and the Supreme Court on March 31 asked governments to ensure that migrants are well provided for and that they are treated in a humane manner.Noting these developments, Bachelet said the Supreme Court’s order and its implementation will go a long way to ensuring the safety and rights of the vulnerable migrants.The government has taken a number of other measures to address the situation, such as ensuring the distribution of food services on a massive scale, pressing employers to pay wages and landlords to waive rents.“In spite of all these significant efforts, more needs to be done as the human tragedy continues to unfold before our eyes. Special measures should also take into account the particular situation of migrant women, who are among those most economically vulnerable and impacted by the situation,’’ she suggested. “We understand the strains on police services at this time, but officers must show restraint and abide by international standards on the use of force and humane treatment in their efforts to respond to this pandemic,’’ she added.The High Commissioner also expressed regret at measures that have the effect of stigmatising sections of society, including migrants, such as stamping the hands of those quarantined, reportedly to ensure that they stay home, and sticking notices outside the homes of people quarantined.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-un-human-rights-chief-michelle-bachelet-distressed-over-plight-of-migrants-65062

We can't hear everyone," said a Bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao.It turned down the plea after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said state governments were accommodating them in unoccupied builder flats.A person — who filed an intervention application in an ongoing PIL on COVID-19 issue—wanted the court to direct the government to invoke Section 65 of the National Disaster Management Act, 2005, under which alternative self-contained accommodation such as unoccupied builder flats, government offices and guest houses coukd be acquired to set up facilities to combat the spread of COVID-19. Such self contained buildings might be much more cost effective and less time-consuming as these were already equipped with electricity and water supply and had lifts, ventilation, better sanitation, hygiene, and security facilities as well, the petitioner contended.

The primary purpose of the guidelines will be on how to deploy these tests in high-risk areas, hotspot areas and non-hotspot areas,” the official said.The ICMR in its interim advisory issued on Thursday had recommended the use of rapid antibody test in COVID-19 in hotspots.As far as tests of COVID-19 are concerned, the official said there are 182 labs in the country for COVID-19 diagnosis, out of which 130 are government labs.The official said about 8,000 samples were tested on Thursday for COVID-19, the highest number of samples tested in a day till now.Agarwal said around 30 lakh people have downloaded the government’s ‘AarogyaSetu’ mobile app which helps people assess the risk of them getting infected with the coronavirus and alert authorities if they have come in close contact with an infected person.The app will detect only fresh cases and will send out alerts to only those who have been near the infected person.He urged people to download the app for their safety.The joint secretary also said Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has expressed concerns over misbehavior with doctors and medical staff, and has appealed to patients and their families not to create obstacles for them while discharging their duties and have termed them as “corona warriors”.He said that the Ministry of Health on Thursday issued an advisory for online training of health professions focusing on areas like field surveillance, contact tracing,  hospital infection prevention and control, use of personal protective equipment, clinical case management, including ventilator management, training on managing quarantine and isolation facilities and community based training in pyscho social care.

03-04-2020||---||Wrong to blame religious minorities over coronavirus origin, says US official||New Delhi, April 3The US Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback has criticised the targeting of minorities in India and Afghanistan.“We are tracking the blaming of religious minorities for Covid-19 virus, and unfortunately, it is happening in various places. This is wrong by governments to do this. It is — the governments really should put this down and state very clearly that this is not the source of the coronavirus,’’ said Brownback on being asked about a hashtag trending in India - #CoronaJihad – that hints that somehow Covid has been spread by the Muslim community. Considered close to US Vice President Mike Pence, he also criticised the killing of minority Sikhs in Kabul in an attack on a gurdwara and said he will soon be meeting telephonically with their representatives to understand their fears and issues in Afghanistan. His observations come against the backdrop of some Sikh groups demanding the resettlement of their Afghan co-religionists as it is impossible for them to stay there.Brownback said his office had held some meetings with representatives of the Sikh community about that attack that took place in Kabul last month killing 25 Sikhs and indicated that there will be deliberations with multiple agencies on the issue.Brownback said he did not have specific knowledge on whether or not Kashmir is getting the type of aid it needs. In genera,l he called upon governments to work with their religious minorities during the pandemic and ensure they are getting the needed resources and aid.The Ambassador wanted India and countries in a similar position to go out in open messaging and say "no, this is not what happened. We know where this virus originated. We know it’s a pandemic the whole world is being subjected to and it’s not a – it’s not something from religious minorities." He was referring to the scapegoating of the Muslim community after Tablighi Jamaat, an Islamic reformist group, held a large gathering of thousands in NIzamuddin, Delhi, on March 13 with foreign nationals from Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Kyrgyzstan, and Malaysia, among which some Covid positive people passed on the infection to the congregation.Brownback regretted that a blame game has started in different places around the world, and hoped that it would get "pushed back aggressively by those host governments".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wrong-to-blame-religious-minorities-over-coronavirus-origin-says-us-official-65055
03-04-2020||New Delhi||PM Modi’s call for lighting ‘diyas’ and candles draws mixed response||Whether a “sensitive and innovative psychological strategy to keep people in lockdown enthused, motivated, collected in times of anxiety and stress” or “yet another media event” by India’s “pradhan showman (biggest event manager)”, the opinion is divided on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s latest effort to evoke collective strength of the country against COVID-19.After the ‘thali’ exercise on the “Janata Curfew” day on March 22, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday asked citizens to light a candle, a ‘diya’ or use flash light of their phones on April 5 at 9 pm for nine minutes at their respective homes to dispel darkness surrounding the coronavirus.Within minutes, the appeal had the social media on fire with hashtags trending with varied views on the PM’s latest initiative, some lauding it and an equal number also making light of it.Some saw it as a “great attempt” by a “powerful world leader” to “infuse confidence and keep the morale up of Indians struggling or passing through times of anxiety and stress in an innovative way” and “make India an example for rest of the world”, others called it yet another “event management”, a “photo-op” to digress attention from real issues and bigger problems”.“Symbolism is important, but serious thought to ideas and measures is equally important,” wrote former Finance Minister P Chidambaram.“We will listen to you and light diyas on April 5. But, in return, please listen to us and to the wise counsel of epidemiologists and economists.“What we expected from you today was FAP II, a generous livelihood support package for the poor, including for those categories of poor who were totally ignored by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharama. Every working man and woman, from business person to daily wage earner, also expected you to announce steps to arrest the economic slide and re-start the engines of economic growth,” wrote Chidambaram.However, BJP leaders, including party president JP Nadda, and supporters were all in praise of the prime minister and asked the people to follow his directive.Some even saw some “astrological” reasoning behind the time chose by the PM“Under PM Modi’s leadership the country has fought coronavirus bravely and in order to continue the fight we stand in solidarity,” said Nadda, urging all BJP workers to spread the message while following social distancing.“At 9 pm on April 5, we will go out in the doors or balcony of our house and light the torch, lamp or mobile light and defeat the darkness of this corona crisis,” said NaddaBut for senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor it was feel-good moment “curated by India’s photo-op Prime Minister”.“Listened to the Pradhan Showman. Nothing about how to ease people’s pain, their burdens, their financial anxieties,” Tharoor said, hitting out at the PM.“No vision of the future or sharing the issues he is weighing in deciding about the post-lockdown. Just a feel-good moment curated by India’s Photo-Op Prime Minister!” the Thiruvananthapuram MP tweeted.Meanwhile, the jury is out on what is being called a great moment that everyone will be looking forward to on April 5.Italy had also done it with residents lighting candles to beat the social isolation imposed in one of the worst affected countries due to coronavirus.Responding to the Congress criticism, BJP president JP Nadda said even in these difficult times the Narendra Modi government has taken several steps for the benefit of villages, poor, farmers and women and provide them relief.The government has announced several measures to strengthen the economy of the country but it appears that the Congress party cannot see it because they are wearing an anti-national blindfold, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modis-call-for-lighting-diyas-and-candles-draws-mixed-response-65053

03-04-2020||New Delhi||Labourers, migrant workers complain of overpriced essentials after security upped around Nizamuddin||Daily labourers and migrant workers living in and around Nizamuddin in the national capital complained of overpriced essentials and vegetables as the police beefed up security in the area after it emerged the biggest hotspot for the spread of coronavirus in India.Onion is retailing at Rs 60/kg, tomato at Rs 50/kg, potato at Rs 40/kg, while other seasonal vegetables are selling at not less than Rs 100-120/kg in the Sarai Kale Khan area, less than 5 km from Nizamuddin West.Even dry ration supplies are being sold at higher price. For instance, rice is being retailed at Rs 850 per 25kg pack now as against Rs 770 a week back.Similarly, wheat flour rate has increased to Rs 350 per 5 kg pack now from Rs 270, while masoor dal rate has gone up to Rs 80/kg from Rs 60/kg. There is Rs 1-6 per pack increase in biscuits in this locality.Sarai Kale Khan houses a large number of migrant workers who work in Ashram, Nizamuddin, Bhogal, Jangpura, Lajpat Nagar and Okhla Mandi.Many work as labourers in local kirana shops, which are exempted from the ongoing lockdown enforced to combat coronavirus.“Everything has become expensive in Sarai Kale Khan after the Nizamuddin incident. There is more police security now. With no job and less money, survival has become difficult. On top of it, kirana shops in the area are selling essentials at prices higher than MRP,” Sabeen, a migrant worker from Bihar, told PTI.Amid tightened security, small kirana shops in the locality are not able to replenish their stock from nearby Bhogal market, one of the oldest wholesale markets in Delhi, and therefore selling whatever stock left at a higher rate, she added.Even hawkers are seeing the trend in the locality and selling vegetables at a much higher rate than other places.Sharing that life under the lockdown has become more stressful, Saleem, who is a private garbage collector in Jangpura but resides in Sarai Kale Khan, said: “I don’t have any more money to survive for next few weeks. I borrowed some from friends, but everything has become costlier.”      Not only migrant workers, even kirana shop owners in Bhogal and Lajpat Nagar areas are facing labour shortage after their labourers were stopped from stepping out of the locality by the police.A wholesaler of rice, wheat flour and edible oils in the Bhogal market said on condition of anonymity, “Four of our labourers who live in Sarai Kale Khan are not able to come for work after the Nizamuddin incident. They are locked up in the locality with others. There is huge demand for essentials from consumers but no labourers to handle.”          Many of the kirana shops in Bhogal are delivering essential items directly to consumers living in nearby localities, but the shortage of labourers has added to their problem.The Delhi Police has tightened the security in Sarai Kale Khan as some of the labourers from here work in shops located around Tablighi Jamaat’s headquarters at Nizamuddin West from where over 2,000 were evacuated this week following a religious congregation that took place last month with thousands of attendees in the middle of a global pandemic.Many of the attendees have tested positive for coronavirus.The event became a key source for the spread of COVID-19 in India as many of the participants travelled to various parts of the country for missionary works.

03-04-2020||---||Engage spiritual and religious leaders to advise against holding congregations: Vice President||New Delhi, April 3Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Friday called upon the Governors and Lt Governors of States and Union Territories to motivate spiritual and religious leaders to advise their followers not to hold any congregations and observe social distancing norms to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Addressing Governors and Lieutenant Governors, along with President Ram Nath Kovind, he also wanted them to focus on the arrangements made to ensure harvesting, storage and procurement of the agriculture produce in their respective States, an official release said.Referring to a recent avoidable action which caused widespread adverse impact across the country, the Vice President cautioned the Governors and Lt Governors to treat it as a wake-up call. “No religious congregations should be allowed to take place in your respective states,” he said.With harvesting season approaching, Naidu urged them to advise the state agencies to ensure the smooth movement of farm machinery so that the farmers did not face any hardship. He also wanted them to ensure 100 per cent of the procurement of the produce. “That is the need of the hour.”Expressing concern over the incidents of assault on doctors in some states, he described them as unfortunate and condemnable and asked the Governors to sensitise the people on the crucial, life-saving role being undertaken by doctors, nurses and other frontline warriors such as sanitary staff and police personnel in the battle against COVID-19. He said such incidents would have a demoralising effect on doctors and others.Complementing services being rendered by medical teams, he said real reasons behind such attacks had to be ascertained and the people made aware that the doctors and nurses were risking their own lives to save others.He also sought to ascertain from Governors and Lt Governors about the arrangements for conducting online courses to enable students to pursue their studies.  The Vice President also enquired about the plight of the stranded migrant workers, supply of essential commodities and medicines to the people. While the States and the Central Governments were doing their best in mitigating the hardship faced by the migrant labour, it was also the duty of the society at large to come to their aid in terms of providing food and shelter to them, he observed.  As many as 35 Governors, Lt Governors and Administrators of States and Union Territories gave an overview of the measures taken in their respective areas to combat COVID-19 pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/engage-spiritual-and-religious-leaders-to-advise-against-holding-congregations-vice-president-65039

This is the time that as a generation of people we must stand up and see that this pandemic does not transform itself into a major calamity for this generation," he said in a video message.He further said that by behaving responsibly and consciously we can ensure this pandemic passes off as a "minor aberration but not a major calamity.""One important thing is don't use social media in an irresponsible way. Do not propagate ideas that a specific or particular religion is the basis of the spread of coronarivus.Let's not do that," he added.When there was a serious problem in front of us, we should not create divisions in the society and further the problem, he added.

03-04-2020||Lucknow||Tablighis who misbehaved with nurses to be booked under NSA||The Yogi Adityanath government on Friday announced that the members of the Tablighi Jamaat, who reportedly misbehaved with the female nursing staff in a Ghaziabad hospital, would be booked under the National Security Act (NSA).Reacting to the incident, CM Yogi said: “They neither follow the law, nor maintain order. They are enemies of humanity. What they have done to the female health workers is a heinous crime for which NSA would be imposed against them. I will not spare them.”The Uttar Pradesh Government has also directed that women health workers and women police personnel will no longer be deployed to treat and provide security to Tablighi Jamaat people placed under quarantine after the Ghaziabad incident of alleged misbehaviour.It may be recalled that the Chief Medical Officer of the MMG district hospital in Ghaziabad had written a letter to the Ghaziabad police informing about the criminal behaviour of some six Jamaatis.According to the hospital authorities, the half a dozen members of the Tablighi Jamaat of whom, one was COVID-19 positive, had been kept at the isolation ward of the hospital.They had reportedly been teasing and passing lewd comments at the staff, demanding bidis and cigarettes, moving around and dancing in a semi nude condition in front of female staff and generally not following the staff’s instructions.Ghaziabad SSP Kalanidhi Naithani initially lodged a case at the Kotwali police station under various sections of the IPC including 354 (assault or criminal force on woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 294 (punishment for obscene acts), and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life).Of the 136 Jamaatis in Ghaziabad who had reportedly attended the Delhi congregation, COVID-19 symptoms were detected in six of them who were admitted to the MMG hospital on March 31.Terming the Tablighi Jamaat as a factory of new coronavirus, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) said instead of bringing people out of masjids, markaz and madrassas, the Centre and the state governments should isolate and quarantine them there only to prevent the spread of the virus.In a joint statement, VHP president VS Kokje, VHP international working president Alok Kumar and general secretary Milind Parande said the Delhi meet could potentially foil the very objective of the nationwide lockdown announced with the purpose of checking the spread of coronavirus.They demanded that the government should cancel visas granted to the clerics who had arrived in India from foreign countries and strict legal action be initiated against them.The VHP also prescribed cremation for those who died due to COVID-19 without considering their religion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tablighis-who-misbehaved-with-nurses-to-be-booked-under-nsa-65034

Genuine persons are helping people on the ground. Sitting in AC rooms and filing PILs does not help," Mehta told the Bench.He said if the court wanted the Centre was ready to file a detailed report on migrant workers.During hearing of another PIL, the Centre had earlier told the top court that more than 21,000 temporary shelters had been set up where close to seven lakh migrant workers had been accommodated across India and they were being given food and medical facilities.The petitioners have also sought directions to the  central  and  state  governments  to  immediately  activate National  and  State  Advisory  Committees  of  experts  in  the  field  of disaster  management  and  public  health  and  prepare  national  and state  disaster  management  plans  for  dealing  with  COVID-19.The plan should be prepared taking into  account  all  relevant  aspects,  mitigation measures, state  disaster  management  plans  for  dealing  with  the  pandemic,  besides mitigation measures, their  possible costs  and  consequences  required under  the Disaster  Management  Act,  2005.The order imposing a nationwide lockdown led  to  loss  of  jobs  and  employment of  lakhs of migrant workers as a result of which they  were faced with shortage of money,  food  and  shelter  and  were forced to march  back  to  their  homes, the petitioners said, adding, it made a mockery  of  the  norms  of  social  distancing.  The  lockdown order  for  which  no  prior  intimation  was  given,  created  a  panic across  the  country  and  led  to  the  instantaneous  loss  of  jobs  and  wages  of millions  of  migrant  workers  employed  in  establishments  across  India  or  self-employed  as  street  vendors,  rickshaw  pullers,  domestic  house  helps,  petty job  workers,  etc, the petitioners submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-centre-to-respond-to-pil-seeking-wages-for-unorganised-migrant-workers-65026

This information can be used by health workers and officials to take further measures. This will help in the identification of infection in a person at a much early stage and can prove to be vital in the present scenario,” he added.According to another team member, Suraj Peddi, the group tested different ways to calibrate airborne infrared cameras to measure body temperature.“Results showed that by installing a cotton swab within the field of view of the thermal camera, the camera can get an accurate reading. The calibrated drone camera can then be used to measure body temperatures while the officer remains at a safe distance away. While the results are encouraging, it is essential to mention this solution is not designed to be used for standard medical procedures,” he added.Elaborating on the development, another team member Sai Kumar Chinthala, said, “At a time when countries across the world are submitting to mass lockdowns owing to the ongoing pandemic, drones have emerged as a fresh breath of air, by proving to be an alternative and plausible lifeline for stranded populations advised social-distancing”.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-iit-alumni-develop-drone-with-infrared-camera-for-thermal-screening-65021

The objective of the proposal is to develop small molecular and polymeric compounds which will be coated, both covalently as well as non-covalently, on various surfaces and kill respiratory viruses completely upon contact, it said.The fourth will help develop material which may be used as a virus tactic and be applied to mops to disinfect the surfaces to remove any adhering viruses or bacteria while the fifth project relates to the development of antibody-based capture of 2019-nCoV and its inactivation using lipid-based in situ gel.The projects were selected after peer-review and assessment by a Special Expert Committee for COVID-19 projects, said the DST.Given the lack of availability of suitable chemotherapeutic interventions and an efficacious vaccine, the global population has been hit hard with utmost vulnerability to the current coronavirus outbreak, it adds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dst-approves-5-technology-projects-to-combat-covid-19-65017

Some people spread false information that chicken and eggs should not be consumed. The adverse impact continued for about six weeks,” Chitturi told PTI here.Though the poultry industry recovered a bit following the clarification issued by them that eating chickens was safe, issues relating to inter-state movement of eggs and chickens at various parts of the country hurt the sector, he claimed.According to the Association, the industry employs more than 10 lakh poultry farmers and contributes Rs 1.3 lakh crore to the country’s GDP directly.The sector provides direct benefit to more than one crore maize and soya agriculture farmers.Poultry farming offers direct and indirect employment to over five crore Indian citizens engaged in poultry production, trading, feed manufacturing, agriculture crops, logistics, exports and others.The AIPBA has submitted a memorandum to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 30 seeking “urgent financial assistance and rescue package” from the Centre.Chitturi said the Association requested restructuring of loans allowing conversion of existing working capital loans cash credit (CC) limits to term loans with two years moratorium.He said the Association also requested the government for interest subvention and issuing fresh working capital.All small farmers with less than 20,000 capacity farms should be provided a compensation of Rs 100 per bird based on their chicks’ purchase bill paid through banking transactions, the Association said in the memorandum.The AIPBA appealed to the Centre to provide wheat and rice of ‘Feed Grade’ from old stock of government at a subsidized rate of Rs 10 per kg.It further sought exemption of GST on Soya Seed and Soya Meal which has added to the input cost on livestock feed to the farmers.The total loss to the poultry industry in two-and-half- months beginning February this year was pegged at Rs 22,500 crore.“The current 2.5 months loss of poultry industry (broiler farmers and layer farmers, Integration companies and breeding companies) beginning 1 st Feb to 15th April 2020 until Lockdown opens is of INR 22,500 CR,” the poultry breeder’s said.On the current market scenario, the memorandum said poultry birds were being sold at a price of Rs 10 to Rs 30 per kg at the Farm Gate level due to fake news regarding Coronavirus.Noting that the production cost of poultry in India was Rs 80 per kg, the Association stated that the prices of eggs have plunged to two rupees per egg at Farm Gate.It pointed out that the cost of production of egg on an average was four rupees per egg, it said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/faced-with-crisis-poultry-sector-seeks-centres-intervention-65014

03-04-2020||Vibha Sharma||'BJP may use Nizamuddin event to push its NRC, civil code agenda'||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 3 While corona numbers are expected to rise (as also revealed by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today) after results of tests of those who attended Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Nizammuddin come forth,  observers are expecting some major political developments in near future in view of the current happenings in the country.The Nizamuddin gathering has already been christened the "hotspot of deadly coronavirus".Yesterday, BJP president JP Nadda slammed those “weakening” India’s fight against Covid19. He did not name anyone or a particular event, but it was clear who he was referring to. Today, quoting a Delhi government letter to the Commissioner of Police, leaders of the BJP's ideological fountainhead, the RSS, said patients from Markaz are creating ruckus in hospitals. “Deployment of more police personnel is sought at hospitals as well as at quarantine centres where those from Markaz have been put up,” they said, leading observers to believe that after CAA and NPR, the incident may be used to strengthen the saffron agenda—the NRC, a population control law and a uniform civil code.Ratings and popularity of the ruling BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi depend upon how India manages and emerges from the corona crisis. The initial days of the lockdown that saw migrant labourers trudging on India’s highways to desperately reach home was a black mark that could and would have been used by the Opposition to pin the BJP on the mat, they say.But the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Nizammuddin has given the saffron party an opportunity to turn around the situation and perhaps also provide a perfect opening for the key Hindutva agenda (NRC, UCC etc), which had to be put on the back burner after anti-CAA protests.After returning back to power in 2019, the Narendra Modi government and its new Home Minister Amit Shah set about methodically to implement and accomplish the Hindutva projects by bringing Constitutional changes in Jammu and Kashmir, setting in motion the construction of “grand” Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and working towards CAA. "Covid19 may have brought governance and economy back on centre stage, but the Tablighi event has given a perfect political opportunity to the saffron party to complete the rest. The PM is expected to bring India out of the crisis relatively less affected than the West, which is expected to add to his goodwill, say observers. Though his response to the pandemic, the health infrastructure and the state of Indian economy will be used by the Opposition to label it as another botched project like demonetisation," they say. Meanwhile, politics over Tablighi Jamaat gathering is in full swing.Referring to Shaheen Bagh and similar anti-CAA protests in the country, leaders like Amit Malviya, Sangeet Som and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi are making no bones calling it “coronavirus terrorism”, “Taliban crime” and “Islamic insurrection” in past three months.“Delhi’s dark underbelly is exploding! Last 3 months have seen an Islamic insurrection of sorts, first in the name of anti-CAA protests from Shaheen Bagh to Jamia, Jaffrabad to Seelampur. And now the illegal gathering of the Tablighi Jamaat at the markaz. It needs a fix!" Malviya said.As per BJP detractors, it is an attempt to "brush under the carpet real issues like plight of migrant labourers".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-may-use-nizamuddin-event-to-push-its-nrc-civil-code-agenda-65009

03-04-2020||Mumbai||Shabana Azmi, Hema Malini condemn the attack on doctors in Indore||Veteran actors Shabana Azmi, Hema Malini and Rishi Kapoor have condemned the attack on medical professionals in Indore.A five-member team from the health department had gone to Taatpatti Bakhal on Wednesday to quarantine relatives and acquaintances of a COVID-19 patient, when an unruly mob attacked them with stones, injuring two women doctors.The video of the attack went viral on social media."Respect. Dr Trupti and Dr Raziya are true role models. And the behaviour of those who pelted them with stones is shameful and condemnable," Azmi said on Twitter.Actor-turned-politician Hema Malini said, "In the midst of the entire country's appreciation of the sacrifices of doctors, health workers and paramedics comes the news of unwarranted attacks on them in Indore by ungrateful miscreants. How could a mob attack people who are risking their own lives to save ours? Sad! Shameful."Kapoor appealed to everyone to not resort to any kind of violence on the medical staff and police."An appeal to all brothers and sisters from all social status and faiths. Please don't resort to violence,stone throwing or lynching. Doctors,Nurses,Medics, Policemen etc..are endangering their lives to save you. We have to win this Coronavirus war together. Please," Kapoor said."Shameful attack on health workers who are risking their lives for us . These people should be punished," Onir tweeted.Actor Divyendu Sharma said, "The most disturbing thing I saw this morning.. is this how we treat our doctors? Health care workers? What are we???? #COVIDIOTS #shameful."Actor Shilpa Shetty said instead of attacking the medical professionals one must come together to help them in the fight against the pandemic."Our medical professionals are out there on the field, risking their lives while protecting ours. The least we can do is come together as a community and help them prepare for the battle they're fighting," she wrote on Twitter.Actor Dipannita Sharma suggested that the health care professionals should be given protection."Health care professionals are our guiding angels. Let's please never forget that .We should be indebted to them, for putting their lives on the line to save others. Nothing can justify attacks on them. It's a disgrace. They must be given protection at this time #coronawarriors," she said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shabana-azmi-hema-malini-condemn-the-attack-on-doctors-in-indore-65004

03-04-2020||New Delhi||No democracy is fighting pandemic by gagging its media: Editors Guild||The Editors Guild of India has said it is “deeply perturbed” over the government blaming the media in the Supreme Court for causing panic among migrant workers, leading to their exodus in the wake of the lockdown, and asserted that such actions could obstruct the process of dissemination of news.In a strongly-worded statement, the Guild said blaming the media at this juncture can only undermine the current work being done by it under trying circumstances.“The Editors Guild of India is deeply perturbed over the recent government statement before the Supreme Court putting the blame on the media for causing panic among migrant workers leading to their mass movement in the wake of the lockdown,” the statement said.This led the apex court to observe that while it didn’t want to inhibit the debate on the pandemic in any way, the media should refer to and publish the official version of the developments pertaining to the coronavirus pandemic, the Guild said in the statement issued Thursday night.The Editors Guild of India has issued a statement pic.twitter.com/eCYKoY73BO  The Guild stated that it holds the court in the highest respect, but finds this advice “gratuitous and unnecessary”.Such charges can also obstruct in the process of dissemination of news during an unprecedented crisis facing the country, it said.      “No democracy anywhere in the world is fighting the pandemic by gagging its media,” it said.The Guild also hit out at the lodging of a First Information Report against the Editor-in-Chief of the website TheWire.                  “A police action in the form of an FIR under criminal laws at this stage is an overreaction and an act of intimidation,” the Guild said.Any such intimidation of the media or blaming the media for mass migration of workers will be counterproductive, it said, adding that such actions will be tantamount to disabling the messenger.“The Guild believes for sure that the media must be responsible, free and fair. But such interference can only undermine those goals,” the statement said.Taking a serious note of the panic caused among migrant workers due to fake news, the top court had earlier this week said it expects the media including print, electronic and social to maintain a strong sense of responsibility and ensure that “unverified news” with regard to coronavirus pandemic is not disseminated.The Supreme Court had said the migration of a large number of labourers working in the cities was triggered by panic created by fake news that the lockdown would continue for more than three months. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-democracy-is-fighting-pandemic-by-gagging-its-media-editors-guild-64999
03-04-2020||Raipur||Born during lockdown, Chhattisgarh twins named Corona and Covid||The pandemic caused by a new virus may have brought the world to its knees, but that has not deterred a couple in Chhattisgarh to name their newborn twins as 'Corona' and 'Covid'.The two words may evoke fear and devastation in minds of others, but for the Raipur-based couple they symbolise triumph over hardships as the twins - a boy and a girl - were born during the ongoing coronavirus-enforced nationwide lockdown which has disrupted normal life.The names, they said, would remind them about all the hardships they conquered amid the lockdown, ahead of a successful delivery on the intervening night of March 26-27 at a government hospital here.However, the couple said they might change their decision later and rename their kids.I was blessed with the twins - a boy and a girl - in the early hours on March 27. We have named them Covid (boy) and Corona (girl) for now," Preeti Verma, the 27-old mother of the newborns, told PTI."The delivery happened after facing several difficulties and, therefore, my husband and I wanted to make the day memorable."Indeed the virus is dangerous and life-threatening but its outbreak made people focus on sanitation, hygiene and inculcate other good habits. Thus, we thought about these names," she said, giving reasons for their unusual decision."When the hospital staff also started calling the babies as Corona and Covid, we finally decided to name them after the pandemic," she said.The couple, originally from Uttar Pradesh, resides in a rented house in the Purani Basti area of the state capital."On late night of March 26, I suddenly experienced severe labour pain and somehow my husband arranged an ambulance operated under 102 Mahtari Express service."As no vehicular movement was allowed on roads due to the lockdown, we were stopped by police at various places but they let us go after noticing my condition," Verma said.I was wondering what would happen in the hospital as it was midnight, but fortunately doctors and other staff were very cooperative," she said."Our relatives, who wanted to reach the hospital, could not make it as bus and train services were stopped due to the lockdown," said Verma, who already has a two-year-old daughter.The twins were born in Dr BR Ambedkar Memorial Hospital.Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the hospital, Shubhra Singh, said the mother and the newborns were discharged recently and they were in good health.As soon as Verma reached the hospital with her husband, arrangements were made to perform a caesarean section on her as it was a complicated case, Singh said."Within 45 minutes of their arrival, the delivery was done successfully," the PRO said.The twins had become a centre of attraction in the hospital after the couple named them as Covid and Corona, Singh said.

Covid virus, like Ebola, is expected to be too short-lived for them to make a healthy return on their expenditure on R&D.The lead this time has been taken by the World Health Organisation which is arranging for at least one major virtual conference daily on Covid research. WHO has now launched a Covid Fund which is being utilised to carry out a major international study which will involve tests of three drug treatments, with both malaria and Ebola medicines involved, on patients from Norway and Spain.Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation, a Norway-based organisation financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and a few governments, is talking to Serum Institute of India, one of world’s largest manufacturers of vaccine in the world.According to John-Arne Røttingen , chief of the highly respected Research Council of Norway, it will take at least three months for the trials to be completed and only then can a medicine be approved. “This is a big, international study including several countries that can include patients simultaneously so the world gets quick results. We don't know how long that will take, maybe in two-three months we can get first results from the data, but that depends on the effect,’’ says Røttingen whose institute was part of a global coalition including the US and India that produced the Rotavirus vaccine, that has helped reduce infant deaths and hospitalisations due to gastroenteritis. This coalition may be getting reactivated to start phase one clinical trial of an investigational vaccine.The French public-health research Center Inserm is sponsoring clinical trials on four drugs which will be extended to other nations including India. Though the Chinese are receiving political flak for concealing the information about the spread of virus, scientists elsewhere are grateful for a Chinese laboratory making public the initial viral genome which enabled Covid tests to be conducted all over the world.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/public-spirit-drives-rd-on-covid-vaccine-64991

The reiteration was necessary since  the last appeal to come out to ring bells or clang utensils during the March 22 Janata Curfew resulted in crowding at many places, attracting adverse observation on social media.The March 22 thanksgiving event for frontline warriors against Covid19 , he said, attracted attention of the world and many countries were now replicating the exercise. “This rekindled awareness of great energy and now it is time to take another great pledge and reach greater heights,’’ he said prefacing the announcement.In doing so, he said, the country will also send a strong message to the poor and helpless people who are suffering most due to the lockdown that they are not alone and there is light towards which everyone is moving together.In these times of difficulty and when people are experiencing darkness with the collective strength of 130 crore Indian it is time to demonstrate vastness, grandeur and spiritual experience though illumination. ‘’This is a Ram Baan [Lord Rama’s arrow to pierce through],’’ in these times.Today’s message is intended to reinforce that each citizen has taken a pledge to move towards the end of the tunnel  and dispel the mood of sombreness and darkness in the country following the 21-day lockdown in force since March 25.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/light-candles-at-9-pm-on-sunday-to-show-solidarity-in-fight-against-covid-19-says-pm-modi-64990

The government said these numbers would rise further as sampling and testing of many suspected cases continues.Also readAmong 400 positive patients associated with the congregation, the most (173) are in Tamil Nadu, followed by 67 in Andhra Pradesh, 47 in Delhi, 33 in Telangana, 22 in J&K, 16 in Assam, 11 in Rajasthan, nine in Andaman and Nicobar Islands and two in Puducherry."This number is rising. The PM said today during his meeting with chief ministers that the rate of rise in cases showed India's battle against the epidemic has just started. The PM said every government official and citizen has to become a soldier in this war. He urged people of all faiths to collectively fight this disease and said religious leaders should ask their followers to observe social distancing," Health Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said as India recorded the highest single-day rise of 15 in overall deaths, taking the toll from 38 to 53 today.As the disease curve escalated, the government made its first estimation of the human resource needed to manage the disease going forward.The Health Ministry in its first "Advisory for Human Resource Management of Covid-19" issued to states estimated a requirement of 52 lakh Covid warriors for surveillance activities as disease clusters such as Nizamuddin emerged. The government pegged the need for quarantine facilities also at 52 lakh and told states that they must have twice the number of ventilators as ICU beds.The advisory was followed by PM's message to CMs to shift the focus to "testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine" and to create a force of volunteers.This is the first time India has estimated the need for personnel required to deal with Covid-19, with the PM today urging the NCC and NSS to pitch in.

Attended by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, former minister P Chidambaram among others, the CWC also noted that the livelihood support the government has given during lockdown period and some additional months is meagre and needed to be augmented.Extending support to the government in the fight against the pandemic, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said the lockdown may have been necessary but its unplanned implementation had caused a lot of chaos.The CWC listed priorities for the government - containment through testing; livelihood support to poor in the form of a common minimum relief plan; maintenance of the supply chain; measures to address economic recession and arrangements for upcoming harvesting.Earlier addressing the CWC Punjab Chief Minister M Amarinder Singh said the state was facing some hurdles in COVID management because of the non-release of Rs 5,000 crore state share by the centre. Singh said he had takenup the issue with Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.While Rahul said there was a need to device an India specific strategy for Covid, the party later said there was no dichotomy in his stand and that of the Congress.
