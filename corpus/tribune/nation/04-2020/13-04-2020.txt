Indian troops have also been retaliating to Pakistani actions under its policy of hot pursuit.According to official figure, Pakistani troops resorted to 3,200 instances of ceasefire violations in Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, which was highest in the last 16 years.

13-04-2020||New Delhi||People should stay where they are, says SC on pleas to evacuate Indians abroad||The Supreme Court on Monday observed that Indian citizens stranded in various countries due to the COVID-19 pandemic should “stay where they are” after the Centre said it would not be feasible to “selectively evacuate” those who want to return due to various reasons.A Bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde said this while hearing through video-conferencing a batch of pleas seeking evacuation of Indian citizens from different countries, including United Kingdom and Gulf nations.“People should stay where they are right now,” said the Bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and MM Shantanagoudar.When one of the lawyers referred to students stranded in the UK, the Bench observed, “Have you seen the affidavit of Union of India? You are secure there. Why do you want to come back?”              In its affidavit filed on a plea seeking evacuation of Indian students stranded in UK, the Centre has given details of the steps taken by the concerned authorities, including the Indian High Commission at London, to assist Indians there.Detailing the Centre’s position regarding evacuation of Indians from abroad amid coronavirus or COVID-19, the affidavit said the country has a very large Indian community abroad, including NRIs and Indian students in foreign countries.“It is true that the GoI (Government of India) initially undertook some evacuation operations of Indian nationals as also nationals of other countries from China, Japan, Iran and Italy when the situation of coronavirus situation in India was not so grim.“Many of the persons evacuated from these countries were then brought and subjected to quarantine in India,” the affidavit said.“However, given the present situation of the coronavirus outbreak in India and the available limited resources, it is not feasible to selectively evacuate Indian citizens from abroad when a large number of them from a number of countries want to return back due to various reasons,” it said.The Centre said that the severe risk posed by arrivals from an increasing number of countries affected by COVID-19 is something that the government is seeking to minimise.“The approach of the government has, therefore, been to advise the Indian nationals to stay put where they are in line with government’s approach to contain the further spread of the virus within India and allowing health machinery to focus on domestic containment effectively,” it said. Meanwhile, the apex court said it would hear after four weeks a plea, filed by Delhi-based advocate Madhurima Mridul, in which the Centre has filed its affidavit.Mridul, through her counsel Sunil Fernandes, has also sought a direction to the government to ensure that till requisite arrangements are made for evacuation, the students stranded in the UK are provided accommodation, adequate health and medical support, if needed, by the Indian High Commission in London.Similarly, the Bench sought response from the Centre on a plea seeking a direction to bring back around 860 fishermen stranded on boats near the Iranian shore due to restrictions imposed globally to contain the coronavirus pandemic.It said that two separate petitions, seeking evacuation of Indian citizens from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations—Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman—would be heard after four weeks.

To contain the spread of the infection, the Indian government had announced a nationwide 21-day lockdown on March 24. The death toll in India due to the pandemic rose to 308 on Monday after 35 new fatalities were reported, while the number of cases climbed to 9,152, according to the Union Health Ministry.  Google said it has taken a number of steps in India to help bring authoritative and reliable information to people, and provide features across its products that can be helpful during these trying times.“We have upped our work to curb misinformation across various platforms and prominently surface the latest updates and health advice from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and international health authorities across Search, Maps, YouTube and the COVID-19 Spot on Google Pay,” the blog said.Across YouTube’s homepage, search, and recommendation systems, Google is elevating authoritative information sources such as the Health Ministry and WHO, driving users directly to these websites for trustworthy and reliable information.   “YouTube has also launched a Coronavirus News Shelf on the YouTube Homepage, which provides the latest news from authoritative media outlets regarding the outbreak,” the blog noted.In addition, Google is also removing reported videos that violate YouTube’s community guidelines, including those that discourage people from seeking medical treatment or encourage the use of unsubstantiated remedies to treat COVID-19.Google had last week launched the COVID-19 India website that collates updated information, as well as live statistics, into a single, easy-to-access resource. It is available in English, Hindi and Marathi for smartphones, and in English and Hindi via Google Assistant for KaiOS feature phones.It will be rolled out soon in several other Indian languages, the blog said.Besides, Google Maps, Search, and Google Assistant are also indicating the locations of hundreds of food and night shelters set up by the government across the country to help people, especially the millions of migrant workers returning to their hometowns, or stranded in the cities without a source of income or food.Google said it has collaborated with the Health Ministry to run a public service campaign to promote information from Health Ministry, including educational video content featuring Amitabh Bachchan, across YouTube, Search and Google Assistant.

It said that the states need to follow the government guidelines on the lockdown “in letter and spirit” during the daily media interaction by the MHA official.Joint Secretary in the MHA Punya Salila Srivastava went on to clarify that all trucks are allowed to move within and outside states.“The Home Ministry has written to states asking them to follow lockdown guidelines of MHA in letter and spirit. Both inter-state and intra-state movement of trucks and goods carriers are allowed, whether or not goods are essential,” she said.The MHA official further clarified that truck drivers would “not require additional permits from state authorities for movement of goods”. She said: “No separate permit or approval is required for cargo movement. Empty trucks or goods carriers are also allowed---since they may be going for pickup of goods or returning after delivery”.As per the MHA guidelines, along with the truck driver, one more person is allowed in the goods carrier. “We have asked local authorities to proactively facilitate the truck driver and cleaner of trucks to travel from their homes to the truck location,” she said.“Workers belonging to the MSME sector and employed in essential items such as atta, dal and edible oil should not face any hurdles. Warehouses and cold storages too should be allowed to operate, whether or not these are for essential items. These instructions are applicable to all areas except hot spots and containment areas,” Srivastava said, adding that with these measures, “we can ensure that there is no shortage whatsoever of essential commodities and services during the lockdown”.To further ensure uninterrupted supply of essential goods, the MHA official said: “Officers of Railways, Airports, Customs and Seaports are authorised to issue movement passes to their staff and contractual labourers”.Call centre coordinationThe central government also started an All India Agri Transport Call Centre for coordination between states for inter-state movement of perishables like vegetables and fuits and agri-inputs like seeds, pesticides and fertilizers.The call centre is accessible from 18001804200 and 1448 both from mobile phones or landline, the Agriculture Ministry said, adding that truck drivers, traders, retailers, transporters or any other stakeholders who arefacing problems in inter-state movement of above commodities, may seek help by calling at the call centre.Call center executives will forward the vehicle consignment details along-with the help needed to state officials for resolution of issues, officials said adding that states have been told to allow free movement of trucksAccording to the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, the Government is taking several measures to facilitate the farmers and farming activities at field level during the lock down period.Under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) Scheme during the lockdown period from April 24 about 8.31 crore farmer families have been benefitted and an amount of Rs 16,621 crore has been released so far.In order to ensure supply of seeds to the states under National Food Security Mission, the subsidy pertaining to seeds under the scheme shall be for varieties less than 10 years.  It has also been decided to allow Truthful Label seeds for subsidycomponent for the North East, Hilly regions and the UTs of Jammu & Kashmir only, for all crops under NFSM.Under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PM-GKY) about 3,985 MT of pulses has been dispatched for delivery to the States/UTs.  In Punjab, organic products are being delivered at doorstep in the specially designed electric van under Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-asks-states-uts-not-to-hinder-movement-of-vehicles-carrying-goods-70614

In fact, sources draw attention to the PM speaking with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin-Salman as early as March 17.When Indian missions reported signs of restiveness in the expatriate community, the Prime Minister conducted Gulf diplomacy in two stages. While remaining constantly in touch with Saudi Arabia, the dominant power in the six-member GCC, the Prime Minister spoke with leaders of Abu Dhabi and Qatar on March 26. This was followed up by phone calls in quick succession to the rulers of Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar.Indian workers in most of these countries live cheek-by-jowl in hutments and with a rudimentary public health infrastructure in all the Arab countries, sources here apprehend a clamour to get out if there is a turn in Covid situation in areas where they live. That is the reason for India stepping up medical diplomacy. A 15-member Indian medical team is already in Kuwait to train its medical staff and thus increase its capability to independently handle the outbreak. India has also lined up several of these countries as the first recipients of hydrocholorquine (HCQ), a drug that keeps infections among health staff at bay and also helps some Covid-affected cases.India’s intensification of engagement in the medical field is to stave off the bigger fear of workers in Gulf countries straining to get back home in case the environment is not conducive for their stay. To put the magnitude of the task in perspective, sources pointed to the much self-acclaimed Operation Rahat that led to the evacuation of less than 5,000 Indians from Libya in 2015. “That many Indians live in just one of the hundreds of settlements in the Gulf countries,” the source added.If Indian expatriates in the Gulf start feeling insecure, a better point of reference would be Air India’s single-handed evacuation of over 1.70 lakh citizens in 1990 due to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. The collapse of the remittance economy at that time had contributed to India’s 1991 economic crises.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-steps-up-medical-diplomacy-with-gulf-to-pre-empt-exodus-70608

Other countries have announced substantial reliefs to help people tide over the lockdown challenges. The US announced a package that was 10 per cent of its GDP, France and the UK have announced 15 per cent of their GDPs as packages. India should give not less than 5 per cent,” Sharma said.Ahead of an imminent announcement regarding extension of the lockdown to address the rising COVID disease burden, the Congress also demanded a factoring fund for the medium and small scale enterprises, adding that the entire industry must be given finances at zero interest.Pledging the Congress support to the anti-pandemic efforts, Sharma said the states should be allowed to set up dedicated COVID funds on the lines of the PM Cares fund.“The Centre shouldn’t discriminate with states. Like monies donated to PM Cares are being treated as CSR funds the same should be allowed for states also,” he said.The Congress warned against economic losses of the pandemic and said the government should forgo concerns of fiscal deficits and inflation to offer a generous second economic package that will ensure the Indian economy doesn’t collapse.He said the factoring fund for MSMEs should be worked out between the industry and the government with the RBI.“It should be sector specific with reliefs for food and anti processing sector plus MSMEs that make up 40 per cent of India’s export,” Sharma added.The Congress also said the lockdown starting March 24 could have been better coordinated to let states arrange for essentials and ensure migrants were taken care of.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-wants-pm-to-announce-at-least-5-pc-of-gdp-as-economic-package-for-industry-related-sectors-70591

Their protest to the excise department did not also yield any result.On Sunday, following the death of two persons from illicit liquor in Kanpur, the excise department finally woke up.A joint team of the police and excise department raided the house of the BJP leader and red-handed caught the son along with a huge amount of liquor.Until late night, the local police was attempting to bail out the son of the BJP leader, who has the reputation of being a muscleman. However, senior police officers sent him to jail.Since the lockdown has been enforced, instances of illegal liquor being home-delivered have emerged from several districts.

13-04-2020||Mumbai||IPS officer, who gave travel nod to Wadhawans, was appointed by Fadnavis govt: Sena||The Shiv Sena on Monday said the IPS officer, who gave permission to scam accused DHFL promoters Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan and 21 others to travel to a hill station amid lockdown, was appointed in the state Home Department by previous chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.It is now clear who is actually behind IPS officer Amitabh Gupta’s decision and on whose instructions he would have put the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government into a “crisis”, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said without taking any name.“This clearly indicates a “conspiracy plot, which could not succeed,” it said.After Home Department’s Special Principal Secretary Gupta allegedly gave the Wadhawans a letter which facilitated their travel to Mahabaleshwar hill station in Satara district last week, Fadnavis said, “It is not possible a senior IPS officer would do such gross mistake knowing the consequences on his own”.Following a row over the issue, the MVA government (comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) on Friday sent Gupta on compulsory leave and ordered a probe in the matter.Defending the government over the issue, the Shiv Sena on Monday said, Amitabh Gupta was appointed in the state Home Department by previous chief minister Fadnavis.He must have trusted the efficiency of Gupta before appointing him to the Home Department.”“It is now clear and self-explanatory who has been actually behind Gupta’s decision and on whose instructions he would have put the MVA government into a crisis,” the Marathi publication said.It is the same officer (Gupta), appointed by previous chief minister Fadnavis, who has “created trouble for the state government by favouring the Wadhawan family,” the Shiv Sena said.“It seems some conspiracy was being hatched but could not be successful,” it said.One of the leaders from Opposition party says there should be immediate action against Amitabh Gupta, while Fadnavis claimed the IPS officer would not do something like that on his own, the Sena said.“It clearly underscores a conspiracy plot, which could not succeed,” it claimed.If this government had any plans to help the Wadhawan family, why would Satara district collector seize their vehicles and put them under quarantine, the Sena argued.“The Opposition in the state should ask its questions to the Centre that who was behind Gupta in issuing the letter (to Wadhawans) and what exactly has the Centre planned in the Wadhawan case, it added.Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan are under the scanner in the Yes Bank and Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank scams.The CBI registered an offence against Kapil Wadhawan, Dheeraj Wadhawan, Yes Bank’s then Managing Director and CEO Rana Kapoor and others on March 7, an official earlier said.Since then Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan were absconding, he added.A court issued a non-bailable warrant against both on March 17, but they did not appear, he said.The Enforcement Directorate also issued summons to the Wadhawan brothers in the Yes Bank case and asked them to appear on March 17. The duo reportedly cited the coronavirus pandemic and skipped the appearance, officials said.

All medical aspects and doctor-patient interface are being dealt with by the ICMR and hospitals,” a scientist said.With the nationwide lockdown in force and office presence being reduced to bare minimum, special teams comprising senior scientists and domain technicians have been formed by these institutes to test human samples for COVID-19.An ICMR bulletin said that till 9 pm on April 12, a total of 1,95,748 samples from 1,81,028 individuals have been tested out of which 8,312 individuals have been confirmed positive among the suspected cases and contacts of known positive cases in India.

We are also holding talks on converting the cages built for wild animals into a quarantine facility.”The authorities have intensified video surveillance of animals. "Any animal with symptoms will be quarantined, the cameras installed in the vicinity of the national park will record the cold and cough symptoms of animals,” he said. Jim Corbett's Wildlife Medical Officer, Dr Dushyant has however stated that there is less risk of animals, especially tigers, getting infected in forest areas. "However, if the animals which live near the human population come into contact with an infected person or thing, then they might get infected too," he said.To prevent the spread of Covid to tigers, the National Tiger Conservation Authority has issued a direction that all workers coming in contact with tigers and elephants should be tested for the virus. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jim-corbett-builds-covid-isolation-wards-for-animals-70396
13-04-2020||BY Satya Prakash||With all focus on pandemic management, judicial activism can wait||There is never a dull day in the Supreme Court. On a normal working day, over a dozen Benches of the Supreme Court take up over 700 cases — 10 times more than what the US Supreme Court hears in a year.Many of these cases are PILs filed by activists, lawyers and civil society groups espousing public cause on behalf of those unable to approach the top court for a variety of reasons. Often such cases hit national and international headlines as the Supreme Court comes to the rescue of the poor, holds the Executive to account, declares laws enacted by the Legislature unconstitutional and even fills in the legislative void.As India fights Covid-19 crisis, the Supreme Court has been flooded with a series of PILs on issues relating to the pandemic. Look at the range of subjects covered in the PILs — wages for MGNREGA job card holders, food and medicines for migrant workers leaving cities, free Covid-19 testing, house-to-house testing, loan moratorium, personal protective gear for doctors, health workers and sanitation workers, nationalisation of health sector, evacuation of Indians from foreign countries, preventing spread of the pandemic among prison inmates and minors lodged in observation homes and many more. Several PILs have been filed in various high courts as well.In any democratic system based on a Constitution that guarantees a set of fundamental rights to its citizens, there is always scope for judicial activism as constitutional courts are entrusted with the responsibility of protecting citizens’ rights against possible excesses by the State.The Executive has been envisaged as a punching bag. No one really holds back their punches when it comes to the Executive – be it the Central or the state governments. The Executive is accountable to Parliament. Citizens and civil society can drag it to constitutional courts for its action and inaction. The Supreme Court and high courts regularly pull it up for lapses, even for inadvertent ones; and rightly so.Barring a few exceptions, including the Emergency days, the constitutional courts have been performing this task to the best of their abilities — often while dealing with PILs or suo motu i.e. on their own.During this crisis as well, many of the PILs did raise legitimate issues. The Supreme Court itself took suo motu cognisance of condition of prison inmates and juveniles lodges in observation homes and issued necessary directions to prevent spread of the virus among them.But these are not normal times. The country is in the midst of a pandemic that has forced the government to declare a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus that has already killed over 1 lakh people across the world. The Supreme Court and high courts are functioning in a restricted manner via video conferencing to maintain social distancing.The sheer number of PILs and some of the issues raised put both the Judiciary and the Executive under undue pressure, raising questions about the PIL mechanism devised to help the poor and the needy. Expectedly, the government maintained a non-adversarial approach.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the top court that till India and the world came out of this unprecedented tragedy such “professional PIL shops” must be locked down. Asserting that the Centre and state governments were working on a war footing, Mehta said government officials should be left to discharge their duties and constitutional courts should be circumspect in entertaining such PILs during this health emergency.The Supreme Court appears to be conscious of the unprecedented situation. Maintaining that policy decisions were prerogative of the Government, a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde on April 7 refused to pass orders for payment of wages to migrant workers affected by the nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19.“We don’t want to supplant the wisdom of the Government with our wisdom...We can’t take a better policy decision at this stage. We don’t want to interfere with government decisions for the next 10-15 days,” CJI Bobde told the petitioners’ counsel. It wanted the petitioner to go through the status report filed by the government first.Covid-19 has enforced a different administrative and social code requiring social distancing to prevent spread of the pandemic. Everyone is trying to adapt and adjust to this new reality that has also drastically increased human dependence on information technology.The scale of the operations to ensure essential supplies to citizens across India; to provide food to the poor; and to give shelter to lakhs of migrant workers headed home on foot along with food and medicines, is unprecedented. Shortcomings are bound to be there. One can point out without finger pointing. It’s time for hand holding. For a change, let’s hold back our punches for normal days.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-all-focus-on-pandemic-management-judicial-activism-can-wait-70395

Besides those firms or MSMEs with export commitments need to be allowed to operate with minimal manpower.Certain industries which can be permitted to start with minimum manpower and proper sanitation and distancing norms on a single shift basis include telecom equipment and components, including Optic Fibre Cable; compressor and condenser units; steel and ferrous alloy mills; spinning and ginning mills, power looms; defence; cement plants; pulp and paper units; fertiliser plants; paints; plastic; automotive units; gems and jewellery and all units in SEZs and EOUs.Further, it has stated that housing and construction sectors need to be allowed if the labourers stay at the sites with all facilities and safeguards. Transport vehicles of all sizes, whether inter-state, intra-state or intra-city, need to be allowed, whether empty or full, by all enforcement . Street vendors, like fruit and vegetable sellers, should be allowed to improve delivery and also provide the much-needed liquidity.It has asked for small agencies involved in providing repair services in mobile, refrigerator, AC, television, plumbing and automobile mechanics, to be allowed. Lastly, the department has recommended that timber industry providing packaging material to pharma companies, FMCG and other companies producing essential commodities be allowed to operate. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/allow-limited-activity-in-key-sectors-dpiit-70391

13-04-2020||New Delhi||Have enough grain for 9 months: Paswan||The Central Government has enough grains to feed over 81 crore beneficiaries of the public distribution system (PDS) for nine months, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan said on Sunday, expressing confidence that its granaries, expecting a boost from a “bumper” wheat crop, will have adequate stock for a much longer period.With the government likely to extend the nationwide lockdown till the month-end, the Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Minister said the transportation and distribution of foodgrains at an “unprecedented” scale has emerged as a “lifeline” during the crisis, with the poor being assured of their ration supply in time.As of April 10, the government-run godowns have 299.45 LMT (lakh metric ton) rice and 235.33 LMT wheat, totalling 534.78 LMT of the two major grains supplied to the poor, Paswan said.The per month supply through the PDS amounts to 60 LMT, he said. Coarse grains and pulses are also supplied through thePDS in a limited quantity.“There is no shortage of grains. We now have a bumper rabi harvest and our estimate is that we will have adequate stock for up to two years,” he said.Though the extended lockdown may have sparked a variety of concerns, including about economy, but any shortage of essential grains like wheat and rice is the least of them.Paswan said in a lighter vein that the condition is akin to “the lawyer (Centre) being more keen about the case than the client (states)”, with the Union government constantly asking states to lift their quota of rations in time after it was announced that all PDS beneficiaries will get three months of supply free. What has been seen is “unprecedented and historic”, he said about the mechanism put in for the distribution of grains, with trains playing a key role.Recently in one day, over 20.19 LMT of grains were moved through trains, a record, he noted.The government has also made it easier for agencies, public or private, to purchase grains from it at a subsidised rate if they are involved in helping the poor.“If in this lockdown there had been any issue regarding the supply of food grains, then it could have created a havoc. So the biggest satisfaction and relief is that it has all gone well,” Paswan said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/have-enough-grain-for-9-months-paswan-70389

The Home Ministry communication also reiterated the directions given by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to all states to deal with psycho-social issues among migrants.The Health Ministry had said migrants were less familiar in their new environment and were prone to various social, psychological and emotional trauma in such situations, emanating from fear of neglect by the local community and concerns about wellbeing and safety of their families waiting at their native places.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-uts-told-to-ensure-welfare-of-migrant-workers-70381
13-04-2020||New Delhi||Prime Minister’s Office mulls phased opening for industry||As inactivity of the past three weeks begins to bite, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) is deliberating on a proposal for the phased opening of the industry, especially small and medium enterprises.Edit: Road map for revivalRead also: Allow limited activity in key sectors: DPIIT Proposals have been submitted by the industry and Nitin Gadkari-helmed Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME).While there should be no activity in red zones of the country, manufacturers should be allowed to resume operations in areas where the virus hasn’t spread widely.Ensuring that industrial units strictly follow sanitation and social-distancing norms will be the key focus area. The drift is for self-certification by industrial units, which can then be corroborated by the health authorities. The second issue relates to bringing back migrant workers, who are considered backbone of such units. The CII has suggested four key indicators for opening up — (i) sectors that are part of and support essential goods and services ecosystem, (ii) labour-intensive sectors, (iii) sectors essential for protecting export market, and (iv) sectors that will help manage imports to the minimum.These should be opened up in three stages. Stage 1 will see opening up of unit producing drugs, textiles and apparels, food processing and minerals and metals. Stage 2 (after a week or so) will see resumption of operations in agri-market, e-commerce, automobiles, chemicals and sectors supporting pharmacy, etc. The remaining sectors will open up in stage 3, a week or a fortnight after stage 2. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prime-ministers-office-mulls-phased-opening-for-industry-70379

In the last five days, average daily testing has been 15,757 and average positive samples are 584, which is about 3.70% positivity rate. Government’s focus now is testing, which will increase once the import order of five lakh antibody test kits arrives and is distributed to states for blood sample-based diagnosis.The Health Ministry allayed fears on the preparedness front, saying health systems were “overprepared and extra cautious” and the available hospital bed strength was much more than what was currently required. Dedicated Covid hospitals across the country have 1.05 lakh isolation beds with oxygen supply functional as of Sunday, whereas the required bed strength to handle the existing cases is 1,689.40 vaccine trials yet to bring results The case load today surged to 8,447 cases and the death toll rose to 263, registering an increase of 1,000 cases and 34 deaths in a single day. As many as 764 people have also recovered, putting India’s disease discharge rate at 9 per cent. An analysis of Covid trends worldwide has shown that 85 per cent of the confirmed cases will have mild symptoms and will be cured with simple medical management; 20 per cent will need hospitalisation and 5 per cent will need critical care management in the form of ICU support and ventilation. At this rate, 20 per cent of the current 8,447 positive cases in India — 1,689 — will need isolation beds in hospitals. “Even on March 29 when our case load was 979 and the required hospital bed numbers were 196, we had 41,974 beds available in 163 dedicated Covid hospitals. Across states, the hospital bed strength is being raised. Exponential increase can happen in this pandemic and we are overprepared for that,” ministry spokesman Lav Agarwal said today.The total Covid cases in India increased nine-fold from 979 on March 31 to 8,447 on Sunday night. The ministry records show that the number of dedicated hospitals rose from 163 to 601 over the same period. The Indian military alone has readied 51 dedicated hospitals with 9,000 beds across 10 cities, including Kolkata, Visakhapatnam, Kochi, Dundigal, Bengaluru, Kanpur, Jaisalmer, Jorhat and Gorakhpur.Central government institutes AIIMS and Safdarjang Hospital in New Delhi have 300 and 500 beds, respectively; four Covid hospitals in Andhra Pradesh have 1,680 beds; Tamil Nadu has one hospital with 350 beds while Kozhikode Government Medical College in Kerala has 950 isolation beds.
