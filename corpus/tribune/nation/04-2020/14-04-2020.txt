The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire world. Many lives have been lost across nations.”“I would like to appeal to all of you to follow the rules of lockdown till May 3. I know that people are facing a lot of difficulties, but it is for our own good, as well as for the good of our families. I know that a lot of people living in Delhi belong to other states, and want to go back to their homes.”“I want to request you to please stay till May 3. Otherwise, there will be chaos across the nation. I want to assure you that I am there for you.”He also people to pay no heed to rumours.“A lot of people will try and spread rumours. They may come you saying that they will help you reach your hometowns, or that DTC buses are taking people to their destinations. I want to repeat, no DTC buses and no buses of any other government are functional right now. You may create a huge crisis for you and your family by stepping out in this hope,” he said.On Monday, the national capital had reported a sharp rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in a day with 356 testing positive, taking the tally to 1,510, while four people died of the disease within 24 hours.Sources said an Army doctor was among those who tested positive for COVID-19.Authorities step up vigilDelhi Chief Secretary Vijay Dev directed police and district magistrates to not allow “any large gatherings” in the national capital.Earlier, welcoming Modi’s decision to extend the nationwide lockdown till May 3, Kejriwal urged people to strictly adhere to the restrictions so that the city gets rid of coronavirus.“Delhi will fully implement PM’s lockdown measures,” he tweeted.Addressing an online briefing, Kejriwal said it is a matter of concern that cases of COVID-19 are increasing in the national capital.“The lockdown is necessary. I am confident that we will succeed in containing the COVID-19 outbreak in Delhi,” the chief minister said.Modi on Tuesday announced that the current lockdown will be extended till May 3. The initial 21-day lockdown was to end on April 14.“If we strictly follow lockdown rules, I am very sure that we will get rid of COVID-19,” he said.Kejriwal also said that he would visit some COVID-19 containment zones in the city on Wednesday to take stock of the situation.On efforts to strictly enforce the lockdown, Dev in his order said: “No gathering will not be allowed because curfew and lockdown are in force”.“There is no question of large gatherings,” he directed officers.A Delhi government official said orders have also been issued to the Delhi Transport Corporation and divisional commissioner to ensure that he lockdown is strictly followed.Only buses placed at the disposal of the police and health department will operate and the rest will be confined to depots, the chief secretary said in his order.“Special Commissioners of Police, Joint CPs, DMs and SDMs have been asked to be on ground to monitor situation closely,” the official said.In an internal communication, Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava said travel passes issued by the Delhi Police will continue to be valid till May 3 following the extension of the lockdown.“The police passes were issued with validity up to April 14.

14-04-2020||New Delhi||ICMR study finds presence of ‘bat coronavirus’ in two Indian species||As the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, researchers have found the presence of a different kind of coronavirus—bat coronavirus (BtCoV) -- in two bat species from Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu, according to a first of its study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).According to the study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research, there is no evidence or research to claim that these bat coronaviruses can cause disease in humans, said Dr Pragya D Yadav, Scientist at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune and also the first author of study.  Twenty-five bats of Rousettus and Pteropus species from Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu were found positive for BtCoV in Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu.“These bat coronaviruses have no relation with SARS-CoV2 responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic,” Yadav said, adding that Pteropus bat species were earlier found positive for Nipah virus in 2018 and 2019 in Kerala.“Bats are considered to be the natural reservoir for many viruses, of which some are potential human pathogens. In India, an association of Pteropus medius bats with the Nipah virus was reported in the past. It is suspected that the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also has its association with bats,” the objective of the study titled ‘Detection of coronaviruses in Pteropus and Rousettus species of bats from different states of India’ stated.     “In the present scenario of changing demography and ecological manipulations, it is challenging to have checks on the encounters of bats with other animals and humans,” the study stated, highlighting that the need for active and continuous surveillance remains crucial for outbreak alerts for bat-associated viral agents with epidemic potential, which would be helpful in timely interventions.“Although CoVs in the subfamily coronavirinae do not usually produce clinical symptoms in their natural hosts (bats), accidental transmission of these viruses to humans and other animals may result in respiratory, enteric, hepatic or neurologic diseases of variable severity. It is still not understood as to why only certain CoVs can infect people,” the study said.The scientists stressed on the need of proactive surveillance of zoonotic infections in bats.The detection and identification of such viruses from bats also recommends cross-sectional antibody surveys (human and domestic animals) in localities where the viruses have been detected.Similarly, if the epidemiological situation demands, evidence-based surveillance should also be conducted, the study said while emphasising on the need of developing strong mechanisms for working jointly with various stakeholders such as wildlife, poultry, animal husbandry and human health departments.“In conclusion, our study showed detection of bat CoVs in two species of Indian bats. Continuous active surveillance is required to identify the emerging novel viruses with epidemic potential,” Dr Yadav said.Elaborating on the study, Dr Yadav said throat and rectal swab samples of two bat species—Rousettus and Pteropus—from seven states were screened for the bat coronavirus during which the representative samples collected from Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry and Tamil Nadu tested positive while those from Karnataka, Chandigarh, Punjab, Telengana, Gujarat and Odisha came out negative.The reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and sequencing were used for the confirmation of the findings. “This is an ongoing study to understand the prevalence of the Nipah virus in bats,” she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/icmr-study-finds-presence-of-bat-coronavirus-in-two-indian-species-71109

14-04-2020||Washington||Coronavirus: IMF projects India’s growth rate at 1.9% in 2020, forecasts global recession||The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday slashed India’s projected GDP growth to 1.9 per cent in 2020 from 5.8 per cent in January, as the global economy hits the worst recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s due to the raging coronavirus pandemic that has nearly stalled all economic activities across the world.With this subdued forecast, India is likely to record its worst growth performance since the 1991 liberalisation. But the International Monetary Fund, in its latest edition of the World Economy report, said India and China are the only two major countries that will register a positive growth rate.The IMF has projected a growth rate of 1.2 per cent for China in 2020---the slowest in more than four decades.However, the two Asian giants are likely to bounce back strongly in 2021 with India expected to grow at 7.4 per cent and China at 9.2 per cent.“We project global growth in 2020 to fall to -3 per cent. This is a downgrade of 6.3 percentage points from January 2020, a major revision over a very short period,” Indian-American Gita Gopinath, the IMF Chief Economist said, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic will severely impact growth across all regions.The Great Depression was the worst worldwide economic downturn that lasted for 10 years from 1929, beginning in the US when the New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street crashed and wiped out millions of investors.Most countries, in the advanced economy group, are forecast to contract this year, including the US (–5.9 per cent), Japan (–5.2 per cent), the United Kingdom (–6.5 per cent), Germany (–7.0 per cent), France (–7.2 per cent), Italy (–9.1 per cent), and Spain (–8.0 per cent), the IMF report said.Even with a sharp rebound in the remainder of the year and sizable fiscal support, the Chinese economy is projected to grow at a subdued 1.2 per cent in 2020.The IMF said several economies in the region were forecast to grow at modest rates, including India (1.9 per cent) and Indonesia (0.5 per cent), and others are forecast to experience large contractions (Thailand, –6.7 per cent).In January, IMF projected India’s growth at 5.8 per cent in 2020 and 6.5 per cent in 2021.On Tuesday, the IMF said that other regions are projected to experience severe slowdowns or outright contractions in economic activity, including Latin America (–5.2 per cent) — with Brazil’s growth forecast at –5.3 per cent and Mexico’s at –6.6 per cent; emerging and developing Europe (–5.2 per cent) with Russia’s economy projected to contract by –5.5 per cent.The Middle East and Central Asia (–2.8 per cent) with Saudi Arabia’s growth forecast at –2.3 per cent, with non-oil GDP contracting by four per cent, and most economies, including Iran, expected to contract; and sub-Saharan Africa (–1.6 per cent) with growth in Nigeria and South Africa expected at –3.4 per cent and –5.8 per cent respectively.This is a crisis like no other, and there is substantial uncertainty about its impact on people’s lives and livelihoods, Gopinath said.A lot depends on the epidemiology of the virus, the effectiveness of containment measures, and the development of therapeutics and vaccines, all of which are hard to predict.In addition, many countries now face multiple crises---a health crisis, a financial crisis, and a collapse in commodity prices, which interact in complex ways, she said.Assuming the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020 and that policy actions taken around the world are effective in preventing widespread firm bankruptcies, extended job losses, and system-wide financial strains, Gopinath said the IMF projects global growth in 2021 to rebound to 5.8 per cent.This is a truly global crisis as no country is spared, Gopinath said.Countries reliant on tourism, travel, hospitality, and entertainment for their growth are experiencing particularly large disruptions, she added.The emerging markets and developing economies face additional challenges with unprecedented reversals in capital flows as global risk appetite wanes, and currency pressures, while coping with weaker health systems, and more limited fiscal space to provide support. Moreover, several economies entered this crisis in a vulnerable state with sluggish growth and high debt levels, the IMF chief economist wrote.According to the World Economic Report, the rebound in 2021 depends critically on the pandemic fading in the second half of 2020, allowing containment efforts to be gradually scaled back and restoring consumer and investor confidence.Significant economic policy actions have already been taken across the world, focused on accommodating public health care requirements, while limiting the amplification to economic activity and the financial system.The projected recovery assumes that these policy actions are effective in preventing widespread firm bankruptcies, extended job losses, and system-wide financial strains, it said.India is likely to record its worst growth performance since the 1991 liberalisation this fiscal year as the coronavirus outbreak severely disrupts the economy, the World Bank said on Sunday.India’s economy is expected to grow 1.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent in the 2020-21 fiscal which started on April 1, the World Bank said in its South Asia Economic Focus report. It estimated India will grow 4.8 per cent to 5 per cent in the 2019-20 fiscal that ended on March 31.

14-04-2020||Kolkata||PM ignored vital economic issues, migrant plight in lockdown speech: Yechury||Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitraram Yechury on Tuesday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ignoring vital economic issues in his address to the nation that was broadcast on Tuesday morning.In a press conference held through the Facebook, Yechury said while over 300 people had lost their lives in the country to coronavirus, more than 200 people lost their lives during this period due to hunger, malnutrition, exhaustion and lack of shelter.“This proportion cannot be sustained,” Yechury said and appealed to the Prime Minister to immediately arrange a cash transfer of Rs 7,500 each to the bank account of everyone whose annual income was less than required to become an income tax payer.“We heard about cash transfer when the financial package was first announced. But nothing has happened since then. Meanwhile, very grave issues regarding livelihood and survival have come to the fore following the lockdown,” Yechury said.The CPI (M) leader claimed that the package announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman amounted to only one per cent of the country’s GDP.“Even a small country like Malaysia announced a package that amounted to 16 per cent of the country’s GDP,” Yechury said. He added that most countries were announcing massive economic packages to tide over the financial difficulties of their people brought over by lockdown and demanded that the central government should also spent an amount equivalent to at least five per cent of its GDP to give relief to people at this juncture.The CPI (M) leader also said that since states were at the forefront of the battle against the virus, thousands of crores of rupees collected under the PM Cares Fund must be handed over to them to enable them fight the pandemic.Yechury said the prime minister announced in his last address that there would not be termination of employment or pay cuts of employees by the management owing to the lockdown.“However, in reality, largescale job losses were taking place across the board. Not only casual workers but even regular employees were losing jobs due to downsizing,” Yechury said. He appealed to the Prime Minister to step in and prevent the largescale firing of employees taking place across industries. On the agricultural front, Yechury said that rice harvested by farmers were still lying with the producers since the mandis are closed and there is no one to procure the crop, He said similar fate awaited the wheat crop also. Yechury demanded that the government must ensure procurement of grain at the C2 plus 50 per cent support price.The CPI (M) leader said he hoped some of the issues raised by him at the press conference would be dealt with when the guidelines for the second phase of the lockdown were announced on Wednesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-ignored-vital-economic-issues-migrant-plight-in-lockdown-speech-yechury-71102
14-04-2020||By Rakesh Dwivedi||Ashok Desai: Pure, enlightened soul in Paradise||Rarely do men leave their imprints in the mind of many. Imprints which live long after their soul departs to live immortally. Ashok Desai was one such rare stalwart who walked the corridors and court rooms of several courts in India. He shone brilliantly as the Solicitor General and as the Attorney General of India.Important cases argued by him can be found in the journals and have been recounted by colleagues. Journey of my knowledge about him began in 1996 when he came to Allahabad to appear for chemical industries in a petition filed by the sugar industry of UP challenging the validity of the UP Molasses Act, 1961. After the day was over, he visited the Sangam and Fort. He was kind enough to drop in for some pegs of whiskey, along with Dushyant Dave, my friend.From him I learnt about “chaser”. Take a sip of whiskey and then sip water. Water chases the whiskey to make you spiritual. More importantly, he questioned me about history of my city and it appeared he knew more than me. Such was his persona. Unsatiated thirst for knowledge of Law and beyond law. And so amiable, unassuming, modest, and friendly. Just sit next to him and you felt elevated. A benign soul who could not think of hurting anyone. I appeared in the Supreme Court in a few cases, both with and against him. It was always a learning experience seeing him navigate through the voluminous facts and string it along with legal propositions. He was not loud, yet judges could not ignore the firmness of his thoughts beneath his softness.On one occasion, I slipped on facts and Ashok bhai, as we addressed him, sprung on his feet saying I was wrong. However, he never attacked me by asserting I was misleading the court. He merely said that “perhaps I was not properly instructed”. I learnt how not to be virulent in countering. A lesson valid for life. A lesson in morality. Life would be so much more peaceful minus the rage.Once Ashok bhai invited me to his home in Delhi for dinner. As I entered his office I could see the musical side of him. When he studied alone classical music was his accompaniment. It was calmness enhanced. After a small chitchat over a few pegs I was led to the dining table for a Gujarati sumptuousness beginning with ‘jalebis’. He was a good host. There are so many sides to him.Ashok bhai was a pure enlightened soul at peace with himself and radiating peace to them who swum within his planet. He has given so much to so many in the court and outside that his spirit would live long before the sands of time cover the imprints. May his soul rest in peace in Paradise.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ashok-desai-pure-enlightened-soul-in-paradise-71098
14-04-2020||Washington||COVID-19: US allows H-1B visa extension, relief for stranded Indians||In a big relief for thousands of stranded Indian professionals in America due to the coronavirus pandemic, the US government has decided to accept their H-1B visa applications for an extended stay in the country.The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a new notification has said it recognises that there are immigration-related challenges as a direct result of the coronavirus pandemic.The announcement comes at a time when countries around the world have closed their borders and all international passenger flights have been suspended globally.The travel restrictions have left a number of H-1B visa holders stranded in the US with their visa permits soon to expire. However, the DHS will shortly start accepting applications for the extension of expiring visas.“We recognise that non-immigrants may unexpectedly remain in the United States beyond their authorised period of stay due to COVID-19,” the DHS said.“We continue to carefully analyse these issues and to leverage our resources to effectively address these challenges within our existing authorities. The DHS also continues to take action to protect the American people and our communities, and is considering a number of policies and procedures to improve the employment opportunities of US workers during this pandemic,” it said.Generally, non-immigrants must depart the United States before their authorised period of admission expires, it said.Non-immigrants could apply for an extension of stay (EOS) or change of status (COS) permit. Without a visa extension, thousands of students and professionals in the US would have suffered.If applicants put in their forms within the specified time frame, their presence will not be taken as “unlawful” and where applicable, “employment authorisation with the same employer, subject to the same terms and conditions of the prior approval, is automatically extended for up to 240 days …when an extension of stay request is filed on time,” the notification said.The US Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS) added that it “reminds petitioners and applicants that it can consider delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic when deciding whether to excuse delays in filing documents based on extraordinary circumstances”.According to rules, if an employer terminates the contract of an H-1B holder, the employee needs to find new employment within 60 days, in order to retain the visa status. Indian IT workers have been seeking an extension of this 60 day grace period to 180 days.According to the USCIS, Indians are the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa programme.

14-04-2020||Mumbai||Dalit scholar Teltumbde sent in NIA custody||A special court here on Tuesday remanded Dalit scholar and activist Anand Teltumbde in the custody of the National Investigation Agency till April 18 in Elgar Parishad-Maoist link case.Teltumbde was arrested by the NIA earlier in the day after he surrendered before it following the Supreme Court’s directives.He is the grandson-in-law of Dalit icon Dr BR Ambedkar, whose 129th birth anniversary is being observed on Tuesday.Civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha, a co-accused in the case, also surrendered before the NIA in Delhi. His anticipatory bail plea was also rejected by the apex court.Navlakha was to be produced before special NIA court here through video conference, but the court said since he had surrendered in Delhi, he will have to be produced before a court there first.An NIA lawyer said he would be produced before a court in the national capital for seeking his transit remand after which he will be brought to Mumbai.Teltumbde reached the NIA office here in the afternoon with his wife Rama Teltumbde and brother-in-law and Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar and surrendered.In the court, the NIA sought ten-day custody of Teltumbde, but judge AT Wankhede granted it remand till only April 18.The Supreme Court on March 17 this year had rejected pre-arrest bail pleas of Anand Teltumbde and Navlakha, and directed them to surrender before the investigating agency.Teltumbde, Navlakha and nine other civil liberties activists have been booked under the stringent provisions of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for having alleged Maoist links and conspiring to overthrow the government.The activists were booked initially by Pune police following violence that erupted at Koregaon-Bhima in the district.According to police, the activists made inflammatory speeches and provocative statements at the Elgar Parishad meet held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which triggered violence the next day during 200th commemoration of the battle of Bhima Koregaon.The police also said these activists were active members of banned Maoist groups.

"We have applied to theauthorities to carry out clinical trials of the vaccine," Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, Secretary, Medical Education and Drugs Department, Government of Maharashtra said.The Maharashtra government had asked the Haffkine Institute to carry out research on the efficacy of the BCG vaccine in combating the Covid-19 virus after experts advised that it boosted immunity in patients.The BCG vaccine is used universally across India to immunise children against tuberculosis and meningitis. Newborn children are usually given the BCG vaccine in India and other developing countries.According to expert advice obtained by the Maharashtra government, the effect of the BCG vaccine wears off with the age of the patient.Officials say, elderly patients and those with co-morbidities may be injected with newer versions of the BCG vaccine to protect them from the Covid-19 virus if the clinical trials are proved to be effective.Initial research by the Haffkine Institute indicates that patients who have already tested positive for the Covid-19 virus but with mild symptoms could prevent worsening of their condition following a fresh round of the BCG vaccination, according to officials here.However, the efficacy of the BCG vaccine on those found to have tested positive for the Covid-19 virus need to be established by clinical trials, according to health department officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bcg-vaccine-to-be-tested-in-covid-19-battle-71090
14-04-2020||Mumbai||Social distancing goes for toss; 'homesick' migrants protest in Mumbai||Over 1,000 migrant workers who earn daily wages gathered here on Tuesday demanding transport arrangements to go back to their native places, hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced extension of the coronavirus-enforced lockdown till May 3.A police official said the migrants were dispersed two hours later and have been assured accommodation and food till the lockdown lasts.In viral videos, police were seen using mild cane-charge to disperse the migrants, who had gathered near the Bandra railway station in suburban Mumbai.Daily wage workers have been rendered jobless ever since the lockdown was announced late last month to stem the spread of COVID-19, making their life a constant struggle.Though authorities and NGOs have made arrangements for their food, most of them want to go back to their native places to escape the hardship brought by the sweeping curbs.Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the migrant workers who gathered outside Bandra railway station might have expected that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would order reopening of state borders.They were told by the police that borders are not going to be opened and the situation was now under control, he said, adding the migrants were assured that the state government will make arrangement of food and accommodation for them, following which the crowds dispersed, he said.State Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray blamed the Centre for the protest by the migrant workers and sought a road map to facilitate their journey back to their native places.In a series of tweets, Thackeray said, “The current situation in Bandra, now dispersed or even the rioting in Surat is a result of the union government not being able to take a call on arranging a way back home migrant labour.”“They don’t want food or shelter, they want to go back home,” Thackeray said. He said feedback from all migrant labour camps is similar - that these workers want to go back to their native places.“Many are refusing to eat or stay in these camps,” he said. Currently, more than six lakh people are housed in various shelter camps across Maharashtra, he added.Describing the Bandra gathering as an intelligence failure, former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya said the state government should explain how so many people gathered at a spot despite the lockdown.According to a police official, daily wage earners, numbering over 1,000, assembled at suburban Bandra (West) bus depot near the railway station and squatted on road at around 3 pm.The daily wage earners, who reside on rent in slums in in the nearby Patel Nagri locality, were demanding arrangement of transport facilities so that they can go back to their native towns and villages.They hail from states like West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.One of the labourers, who did not reveal his name, said, NGOs and local residents are providing food to migrant workers, but they want to go back to their native states during the lockdown which has badly affected their source of livelihood.“Now, we don’t want food, we want to go back to our native place, we are not happy with the announcement (extending the lockdown),” he said.Asadullah Sheikh, who hails from from Malda in West Bengal, said, “We have already spent our savings during the first phase of the lockdown. We have nothing to eat now, we just want to go back at our native place, the government should made arrangements for us.”Another labourer, Abdul Kayyun, said, “I am in Mumbai for last many years but have never seen such a situation. The government should start trains to shift us from here to our native place.”Hundreds of migrant workers took to the streets of Mumbra town in Thane district on Tuesday, demanding that they be sent to their hometowns in light of the COVID-19 lockdown, which has rendered them jobless.Workers, mostly from Jharkhand, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, who live in rented accommodations, claimed that houseowners were demanding rent from them and they were unable to procure essentials.Tuesday’s gatherings came days after violent protests by migrant workers in Surat who were demanding that they be sent to their native places. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/social-distancing-goes-for-toss-homesick-migrants-protest-in-mumbai-71089

14-04-2020||New Delhi||I am missing you: Longing for barbers, beauticians to return to work, bad hair days to end||Unkempt hair, grey roots and scruffy beards were probably last in the list of worries when India went into lockdown three weeks ago but with ‘stay-at-home' extended till May 3 on Tuesday, these are problems growing by the day – quite literally. Hair, say experts, grows half-an-inch a month. And with salons and barber shops closed in the pan India shutdown to contain the spread of COVID-19, this is one issue that just can't be snipped away. It's not just about one bad hair day but about 40 and maybe more as increasing numbers of people sport the “quarantine look”. So, you have men who can't deal with their long hair, bushy moustaches and overgrown beards and women just waiting to get their hair back in style, their eyebrows shaped and their arms and legs looking smooth and, well, hair-free. And, of course, there are those who need desperately to touch up their roots with the black, blue-grey or burgundy tones that cover the grey.          Because looking good is left to experts trained in the art of hairstyling, threading, waxing and trimming, the hair dresser-beautician is being sorely missed. Even the roadside guy who sets up shop on street corners. Most people usually have hair appointments every four to eight weeks. Many were already due for their next haircut when the lockdown was imposed on March 24, first for three weeks and now extended by 19 days.  "Never did I think I would have to wait for my trip to the parlour for this long. I guess bushy eyebrows and grey roots must be bothering a lot of women now. Unlike wives, husbands are useless when it comes to helping in our grooming," said Vandana Thapa, a homemaker who helped her husband with his haircut just a few days ago.      As men look for bands to push back their hair, some tying it up in a not so trendy ponytail, and women deal with their ungroomed selves and chipped nails, there is no solution in sight except one – do it yourself. Or get a family member to take quick lessons and do it for you.Ankush Mangotra, 29, just went the full monty and shaved his beard and hair after being mocked by his girlfriend and mother for his long hair and biblical beard. “It had been more than a month since I had my last haircut. Then the lockdown happened. My mother and girlfriend were after my life… Eventually, I gave in, and got myself a buzz-cut with a little help by my mother,” said the Delhi-based IT professional.Mangotra is not alone in the DIY trend. Cricket captain Virat Kohli as well as Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan went that way too."This is what quarantine does to you. We allow things like this to happen. Getting a haircut with kitchen scissors! Can you see this gradual fade? Beautiful haircut by my wife," Kohli said in a video of his actor wife Anushka Sharma cutting his hair.Paswan got his beard trimmed by his son, MP Chirag Paswan."Tough times but see lockdown also has a brighter side. Never knew had these skills too!  Let's fight Corona19 and create beautiful memories too! StayHomeStaySafe," Chirag Paswan tweeted along with the video.Forced self-grooming sessions, according to celebrity hairstylist Apeni George, should make people—celebrities and commoners—understand and appreciate grooming professionals better.“After things get back to normal  I sincerely hope people will no more ask us why we are taking so much time. This aside, I make it a point to educate my clients about the process when they come to me so they can work out something when I am not around."There are no secrets, the more they are aware the better it is for us,” the Mumbai-based stylist to many cricketers and Bollywood stars told PTI.But holding clippers or kitchen scissors is not everyone's forte.      Social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram and TikTok are filled with images of DIY haircuts gone wrong—from accidental bald patches to uneven skin fades.Even the suave Sachin Pilot "botched it up". When a noted journalist took to Twitter asking if haircut can be declared an essential service. Pilot tweeted in reply, "Too late. Did it at home. Botched it up."     "Just clean and groom it. Don't panic. Don't use chemicals, no scissors, stick to trimmers only. Wait for an expert, or wait till you become an expert watching YouTube videos. Best is wait it out. Things will get back to normal and your hair too will be just fine," advised George.      That said, there are many who believe there is no better time to go grey as they planned to – the weeks at home will cover the awkward in-between patch – or experiment.  From van dyke, mutton chops and fu manchu in beards, to close-cropped, funky bowl cut and faux hawk in hairstyles,  nothing is off the table for bravehearts.      "'What if it turns out to be a blunder' or 'my friends would make fun of me' were the only two things that kept me from trying different things with my beard. But not now when we all are house-bound," said Arnav Khajuria, a Class 11 student, who has started sporting a goatee during his isolation. Some big salons have been keeping touch with their clients through the lockdown period.“We have been in regular touch with all our customers…  giving them wellness and beauty care tips and routines that they can adopt while at home. We are also advising them online as well through emails and calls on immunity building, which is an area of huge concern at the moment. In addition, we are also getting queries for advise on hair and skin maintenance,” said Sandeep Ahuja, director at VLCC Health Care  Ltd.India has been under a three-week lockdown since March 24 and millions are confined to their homes to contain the spread of the disease that has infected more than 10,360 people and claimed at least 339 lives.

14-04-2020||New Delhi||Popularise code word for women suffering from lockdown violence, senior women advocates tell Centre||The rate of crimes like theft and murders may have come down due to unprecedented situation of the countryside lockdown but reports are suggesting a rise in domestic violence cases due to forced quarantine.It has been found that many women who are victims of domestic violence are more vulnerable during the lockdown period as families become more confined to homes under the stress of uncertainty.While NCW has started a special helpline to help with such cases, senior Supreme Court lawyers Avani Bansal and Sourjya Dasand have written to Union Minister Smriti Irani and NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma recommending proactive measures to deal with such cases, including better advertising of the domestic violence helpline through newspapers and relevant government websites and popularising a “code word” for victims.“The government should popularise the use of a code-word through which the domestic violence victims can report to the pharmacy stores (which are open during the lockdown) that they need support and that they are victims of domestic violence,” they said in the letter. “For e.g. the Spanish Government, followed by then French Government initiated the use of the code-word ‘Mask-19’ which are being used by the women in these countries,” they said.  Studies indicate pandemics, similar to times of economic uncertainty, civil unrest and disaster lead to increased violence against women and children across the world.Recently the UN Secretary-General tweeted: “Peace is not just the absence of war. Many women under lockdown for #COVID19 face violence where they should be safest: in their own homes,” echoed by Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka, Executive Director of UN Women.“Confinement is fostering the tension and strain created by security, health and money worries; and is increasing isolation for women with violent partners,” she said. describing the situation as “a perfect storm for controlling, violent behaviour behind closed doors”.According to the lawyers, first, it is important to note that most women in India may not necessarily be aware of the existence of the National Commission for Women and therefore may not come to its website to see the Whatsapp alert number.Secondly, most women in India may not have access to Whatsapp or email/internet. Therefore it is pertinent that the government launches a phone helpline which is treated as an ‘essential service’ and operates on a 24x7 basis.Thirdly, information and awareness are critical in situations like this, they said. The Government of India needs to have a massive awareness drive, by publishing the phone helpline number, issued by it, and the Whatsapp alert number issued by National Commission of Women in all major newspapers of India, and all relevant government websites, they saidThese need to be advertised in all newspapers, including regional newspapers for at least one week, on the top left corner/centre/right corner of the front-page of a newspaper for easy visibility.Further, in addition to this, the government can take the following steps to ensure that the information regarding the helplines reaches women across India The government should provide leaflets of the notice across every state/district in regional languages across India for one week and commence an SMS Alert service for women who do not have access to WhatsApp or own a smartphone.“This letter is written to you devoid of any personal interest and with the sole intention to enhance accessibility to available helplines for women across India who are subject to domestic violence,” they say, urging the government to use the legal and judicial apparatus under the Domestic Violence Act, 2005, where the Magistrate can pass an order on the first date for shelter provision, after hearing the victim through video conferencing. "The government may also in its discretion to provide additional ways to identify victims who are in desperate need of such shelter during lockdown, by allowing complaints to the local SDM in this regard on an urgent basis,” they add.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/popularise-code-word-for-women-suffering-from-lockdown-violence-senior-women-advocates-tell-centre-71079

14-04-2020||New Delhi||Lockdown 2.0: Coronavirus battle to be fought in red, orange, green zones||In Lockdown 2.0 beginning on Wednesday, Ministers as well as the states will now combat the coronavirus crisis by marking the areas as Red, Orange and Green zones.These zones will be declared as per the number of coronavirus-affected people.Sources indicated that a consolidated report submitted to the Prime Minister's Office from the Home Ministry on Monday, based on assessments, had mentioned the implementation of earlier guidelines as well as a zone-specific plan to fight the pandemic.The government would start a mammoth exercise from next Monday (April 20) to categorise the country in zones.A new set of exemptions in services and essential items is expected to be released as per the reports prepared by the Joint Secretary and above officials from different ministries following the countrywide exercise.In this exercise, the Aarogya Setu App would play a major role, an official told IANS, adding it would help in categorising area-specific COVID-19 cases.Here's an explainer on the zones:Red: Areas with substantial numbers of positive cases would fall under this zone where there will be the complete restriction. The government will try to provide door-to-door facilities in these areas.Orange: The areas with a limited number of cases in the past and with no surge in positive cases recently would be included under the orange zone. Only restricted activities such as limited public transport and farm product harvesting is expected to be allowed in the coronavirus orange zone.Green: The districts with no coronavirus positive cases would fall under the green zone. Exemptions may be given in these sectors as per the government's plan. Limited movement of people linked to essential services and business may be given extension. Opening of liquor shops and other essential items that play a major role in generating state revenue may get an extension in this zone.Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) engaged in manufacturing of essential items like wheat four (atta), pulse (dal) and edible oils would be allowed to function freely in orange and green zones with strict maintenance of social distancing.Agricultural activities are also likely to be allowed in these zones. Warehouse, cold storage will be allowed to freely function with allowance for to and fro movement of trucks and without regard to the nature of the goods whether essential or otherwise. Warehouses of companies should also be allowed to operate.Movement of persons and vehicles, however, will have to follow the strict adherence to norms of hygienic and social distancing as it is required in the COVID-19 context.It is strictly mentioned that the state and field authorities will implement the guideline related to trucks with "letter and spirit".As per this "intra-state and inter-state movement of all trucks and other goods or carrier vehicles with one driver and one additional person is allowed as long as the driver is carrying a valid driver's licence."This is irrespective of the nature of the cargo, whether essential or otherwise. No further permit or approval would be required." The guideline issued by Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla on April 12 clearly directs the states and Union Territories (UTs) that "empty trucks or good carriers should also be allowed to operate while on way to pick up goods or returning after completing a delivery.Hence, there is no cause to stop empty trucks provided they have valid documents such as driving license and road permit".The government's focus would be to ensure that railways, airports, seaports, and customs authorities issue passes to their staff and contractual labour.Similar steps would be taken by states and UTs so that they expedite issuing passes to workers engaged in manufacturing units.

14-04-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus tests, hotspots: All you need to know||As the world is reeling under the COVID-19 pandemic, medical terminologies like rapid antibodies test, RT-PCR test, hotspots and containment zones have come into focus.Doctors explain for the common man what these testing and containment terminologies mean.Two kinds of diagnostic tests are being currently used in India -- RT-PCR test and rapid antibodies test, as per the global health norms.A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA that detects the virus while the antibody tests, which use blood, detect the body's response to the virus, experts said."In RT-PCR, it is tested if the virus is present or not. A sample is taken from the respiratory tract of a person, throat swab or a sample from thenaseopharyngal region and then rested. The results take about 12-24 hours," said noted Delhi-based lung surgeon Arvind Kumar.Kumar, who works at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here, said, RT-PCR tests take time and are a costly affair because of its elaborate kit."On the other hand, the rapid antibodies test are less expensive and the results can come in 20-30 minutes. It essentially tests if the antibodies in response the coronavirus infection has been generated or not," he said.These tests are generally used in hotspots where the infection is found concentrated in a given area. A hotspot is a zone from where a large number of COVID-19 cases are reported.In Delhi, till Monday night the number of hotspots stood at 47, which have been made containment zones and sealed."In rapid antibodies test, the result will be positive only if the antibodies have been generated. So, even if a person is infected but the antibodies are not generated, the result will come negative," Kumar said.In many cases, it has happened in the past that a person tested negative earlier but after a few days when he or she reached another country, the test came out positive there.This same person would have come out positive had the RT-PCR test been conducted, but the issue of feasibility of its use.In government labs, the tests are free but at private laboratories, which use RT-PCR test the cost is Rs 4,500.The Supreme Court on Monday modified its April 8 order that asked private labs to conduct free COVID-19 tests and said the benefit will be available only to "economically weaker sections" who are covered under a government scheme such as Ayushman Bharat.The apex court said it never intended to make testing free for those who can afford to pay.It had on April 8 directed that private labs, which were allowed to charge Rs 4,500 for it, would not charge for the tests observing that they need to be philanthropic in the hour of national crisis.A spokesperson of the Thyrocare labs, one of the laboratories authorised by the government to do testing, said, testing has to be done judiciously as there are less number of kits in India."A doctor's recommendation is required before we can do testing. Well-known video blogger Mumbiker Nikhil had recently returned from the UK and he got his testing done and even made a video on it to raise awareness as people coming from abroad should consult doctors, especially if they are showing symptoms," he said.The death toll due to coronavirus in the country rose to 339 while the number of cases soared to 10,363 on Tuesday, said the Union Health Ministry.Doctors at Delhi government hospitals said from naseopharyngal and oral samples, if either of that comes positive, that person is considered COVID-19-affected.How well these tests work depends on several factors, including the time from the onset of illness, the concentration of virus in the specimen, the quality of the specimen collected from a person and how it is processed, and the precise formulation of the reagents in the test kits, experts said.Additionally, false-positive results—that is, a test showing that a person is infected when they are not—could occur if the antibodies on the test strip also recognise antigens of viruses other than COVID-19, such as from human coronaviruses that causes the common cold, they said.

However, the facility of online cancellation will remain functional.“As far as trains cancelled up to May 3 are concerned, refunds would be automatically provided by the railways online to the customers, while those who have booked at the counters, refund can be taken up to July 31. Full refund will be given for tickets for the bookings made for the trains cancelled,” it said.“Full refund will also be there for those cancelling the advance bookings of tickets for trains not yet cancelled,” the railways said.Railways has also extended its earlier waiver of demurrage, wharfage, stacking, stabling, detention and ground usage charges till May 3 for those using its freight services in view of the extension of the lockdown period.These charges were previously waived off till April 14.After Modi’s announcement of a 21-day lockdown across the country on March 22, the railways on March 24 had announced that its suspension of all passenger services will continue till April 14 in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.The railways said that passengers could claim a full refund for all trains cancelled in this period till June 21.Around 15,523 trains will be affected, including 9,000 passenger trains and 3,000 mail express services which run daily.India has so far reported 10,363 COVID-19 cases and 339 deaths.

It may be early to talk about results in numbers, but a six-week nationwide lockdown to facilitate effective physical distancing, coupled with expansion of core public health measures such as detection, isolation and tracing contact of COVID19 positive people, would go a long way in arresting the virus spread.”Khetarpal said despite huge and multiple challenges, India had been demonstrating unwavering commitment in its fight against the pandemic. “In these testing times, the action lies as much with the communities as with the authorities and the health workforce. It is indeed time for each and everyone to contribute their best and together beat the virus,” she said.Globally as of April 13, WHO reported 17,76,867 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,11,828 deaths.Out of the six WHO regions Europe has reported the highest cases worldwide at 9,13,349, followed by 6,10,742 in the Americas; 1,21,710 in the Western Pacific; 1,02,710 in the Eastern Mediterranean; 17,385 in South East Asia and 10,259 in Africa.Maximum cases worldwide are in the US at 5,24,514, followed by Spain, Italy, Germany, France, the UK and China.India has 10,363 cases as of Tuesday and 339 deaths.

14-04-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus: Several schools announce fee hike, add to woes of parents||While parents are waiting for a school fee waiver during the lockdown due to COVID-19 situation in the country, several schools have announced a fee hike adding to their woes.Parents have started an online petition to the HRD Ministry demanding a directive to schools for not implementing fee hike this academic session at least till schools reopen.While the Gujarat government had on Monday announced that private schools will not hike fees for an year, the West Bengal government had appealed schools to refrain from hiking fees. However, no clear instructions have been issued on fee hike in Delhi-NCR."With no information when normalcy will return, when we could head back to our respective workplace is the question that remains unanswered and here, I receive an intimation from the school regarding the hike in fee. I was baffled that how would I be able to cope up? I am anxious to know about the school fee hike and transport fee hike which the school says is to meet the cost demands for the academic year 2020-21," said Pivit Joshi, whose son studies in a prominent school in Noida. He did not wish to identify the name of school.Jagriti Shukla, a parent in Gurgaon, said, "We understand the schools' concern that they need to pay salaries and cannot waive fees but at least hike can be avoided at such crucial time. Why the government has not passed any order in this regard?"      Similar concerns were shared by Rajesh Kumar, who said the fees hike has added to the financial woes already caused by pay cuts or loss of incentives."We are getting basic pay but the performance linked incentives have been suspended for the lockdown period. The appraisals have been deferred to next financial year but the school's fee hike is going on as per usual," he said.The schools were closed by mid March, ahead of the nationwide lockdown announcement due to the spread of coronavirus. The 21-day lockdown, which was scheduled to end today, has now been extended till May 3. However, several schools have already begun teaching and learning activities online. Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments have announced that schools should not force parents to pay fees during the lockdown. However, there is no clarity among parents about whether no fees will be charged during the period, or they will have to be paid later. While the Delhi government has not issued any directive about any possible fees waiver, the private schools in Delhi are supposed to get clearances on fee hike from government's fee review management committee.The death toll due to coronavirus infection in the country rose to 339 while the number of cases soared to 10,363 on Tuesday, said the Union Health Ministry.While the number of active COVID-19 cases stood at 8,988, as many as 1,035 people have been cured and discharged and one had migrated, it said. The total number of cases include 72 foreign nationals.

A large part of the execution is expected to be done by states.Apart from a call centre for coordination between states for inter-state movement of perishable goods like vegetables and fuits and agri inputs like seeds, pesticides and fertilisers, etc, the government is  taking several measures to facilitate the farmers at the field level during the lockdown period.Under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, about 8.31 crore farmer families have benefitted during the lockdown period from March 24. An amount of Rs 16,621 crore has been disbursed among them so far.To ensure the supply of seeds to states under the National Food Security Mission, the subsidy pertaining to seeds under the scheme shall be for varieties less than 10 years old. It has also been decided to allow Truthful Label seeds for subsidy component for the North East, hilly regions and the UTs of Jammu & Kashmir only, for all crops under the NFSM.Under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PM-GKY), about 3,985 MT of pulses have been dispatched for delivery to the states/UTs. In Punjab, organic products are being delivered at doorsteps in specially designed electric vans under Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-fresh-guidelines-govt-expected-to-relax-norms-for-agri-sector-71041

14-04-2020||New Delhi||Newborns may get coronavirus transmission from mothers: ICMR issues guidelines||The Indian Council of Medical Research on Monday said the emerging evidence suggests that transmission of coronavirus from mother to baby before birth or during delivery is possible although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the significance to the neonate is yet to be determined.The apex health research body also said there are no recorded cases of breast milk being tested positive for COVID-19 at present, and no data suggesting an increased risk of miscarriage or early pregnancy loss in relation to the disease."...Emerging evidence now suggests that vertical transmission (from mother to baby antenatally or intrapartum) is probable, although the proportion of pregnancies affected and the significance to the neonate has yet to be determined," it said.However, it is unknown whether newborns with COVID-19 are at an increased risk for severe complications and transmission after birth via contact with infectious respiratory secretions is a concern, the ICMR said.In guidance for management of pregnant women during the pandemic, the apex body said hospitals should consider “temporarily separating” (separate rooms) the mother, who has COVID-19 or is a suspected case, from her baby until the mother's transmission-based precautions are discontinued."Also, there is no evidence currently that the virus is teratogenic (causing developmental malformations). Long-term data is awaited," the ICMR said.It clarified pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract the infection than the general population.“However, pregnancy itself alters the body's immune system and response to viral infections in general, which can occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for COVID-19”.In other types of coronavirus infection(SARS, MERS), the risks to the mother appear to increase in particular during the last trimester of pregnancy. There are case reports of preterm birth in women with COVID-19 but it is unclear whether the preterm birth was always iatrogenic, or whether some were spontaneous. Pregnant women with heart disease are at highest risk (congenital or acquired), the ICMR said, adding the coronavirus epidemic increases the risk of perinatal anxiety and depression, as well as domestic violence."It is critically important that support for women and families is strengthened as far as possible; that women are asked about mental health at every contact," it said.The guidance states that the obstetric units should ensure appropriate isolation of pregnant patients who have confirmed COVID-19 or are under investigation.Healthcare providers should create a plan to address the possibility of a decreased workforce, a potential shortage of personal protective equipment, limited isolation rooms, and should maximize the use of telehealth for prenatal care.ICMR said the guidelines are based on the limited evidence available to date about the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19, and knowledge of other viruses that cause severe respiratory illness including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The recommendations are based on guidelines from international disease control agencies and publications and simplified for the Indian context, the document stated.

It is not in the interest of normal people to take the scheduled H drug if they do not have COVID-19 symptoms, he said.This type of self-medication can cause harm and side effects if not taken under proper care of doctors, he warned."Therefore, we have advised people not to take the medicine without the prescription of doctors. We have also asked chemists not to sell the drug to patients coming without the doctors' prescription," the official said.Chemists have been asked to maintain a register of purchase and sale of the drug, which they have to do for all the scheduled H drugs, he said.A chemist in Bopal area of Ahmedabad said many people come to his store asking for hydroxychloroquine in a day, but he sells it only to those who have proper prescription.Koshia said the Gujarat government has enough stock of the medicine, but an advisory has been issued so that there is no shortage of the drug in the open market."If everybody starts stocking or consuming the drug, it will create shortage in the market. This advisory is issued so that this anti-malarial drug is available for patients who need it, he said.The Gujarat government stockpiled over one crore shots of the medicine as it became clear that this can be a useful medicine against coronavirus, he said, adding that the drug is manufactured in a large quantity in the state."The Food and Drug Control Authority of Gujarat has given approval to 28 companies to produce hydroxychloroquine.Of these, three companies produce active drug ingredients, which are raw material for production of the medicine, he said, adding that Gujarat will not face its shortage.Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani recently said three companies from the state have been asked to produce hydroxychloroquine to export it to the US, after President Trump asked the Indian government for its supply.On the effectiveness of the drug in the fight against coronavirus, Koshia said some studies, especially in France, say that it works."The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recommended that this drug should be given to frontline health workers who are involved in treating those suffering from COVID-19, he said.Earlier, India had banned the drug's export after it was found that it can be key to the treatment of COVID-19.However, after requests of US President Trump and from other countries, the export curbs were partially lifted.Gujarat has so far reported over 570 COVID-19 cases and 26 deaths.

The Ministry's count put the numbers at 10,815 on Tueday evening---up from 9,352 last night---in a matter of a day, with deaths also rising to 353 officially.Meanwhile, India is ramping up its hospital preparedness with over 600 dedicated COVID hospitals in place and more being built.The women self-help groups across the country have been roped in for making masks with the PM advising people not to step out of the house without a mask.India will further get first supply or antibody kits by April 15 after which it plans to increase blood sample based testing in hotspots to check the scale and extent of the disease.India’s average sample testing per day even today is around 16,000, which experts say is low and may be hiding the actual national disease burden.Antibody kits have to be imported and the Government has engaged various countries for help, including China.COVID Disease graph has been peaking since March 29 when India had only 979 cases. The case load had gone up ten times in a matter of 13 days with new clusters like Delhi’s Nizamuddin emerging and disproportionately adding to the disease load.

India will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces,” the Pentagon said.While the Harpoon missiles will be manufactured by Boeing, the torpedoes would be supplied by Raytheon, the notification said.The proposed sale, it said, will improve India's capability to meet current and future threats from enemy weapon systems. The MK 54 Lightweight Torpedo will provide the capability to conduct anti-submarine warfare missions.“India will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defence. India intends to utilize MK 54 Lightweight Torpedoes on its P-8I aircraft. India will have no difficulty absorbing these systems into its armed forces,” it said.In both the notifications, the Pentagon said the proposed sale of these equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.According to the Pentagon, this proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defensive partner, which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia region.

14-04-2020||New Delhi||Visas of foreigners extended till April 30||The government today decided to extend on gratis basis the regular visa and e-visa of foreign nationals, who have been stranded due to lockdown, till April 30.In an official statement, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said all those foreign nationals whose regular visa, e-visa or stay stipulation in India have expired or set to be ending during February 1 (midnight) to April 30 (midnight), would be “extended till April 30 (midnight) on gratis basis, after making an online application by the concerned”.The foreign nationals are stranded in the country due to the 21-day lockdown announced on March 24 to curb the spread of Covid-19.Further to remove any confusion in this regard, the MHA on March 28 allowed consular services on gratis basis to the stranded foreigners, presently staying in India due to travel restrictions, till April 30.Earlier, the government had extended till April 15 the regular and e-visa of those foreigners who are currently unable to leave the country. The decision to extend the visa exemption till April 30 was apparently taken in view of the near certain extension of the ongoing lockdown till April 30, it is said in the statement.The government’s decision on the extension of permission for foreign nationals to stay in India till April 30 is also seen as an indication that international flights, cancelled since March 25, will not resume before April 30.Thousands of foreigners are stuck in the country since the imposition of the travel restrictions, and are unable to exit the country during the validity of their visa.

In a letter to the PM today, Gandhi said the poor people, including migrants who may not have ration cards, should also get the food security benefit.The current crisis has pushed many relatively food secure families into poverty. We must ensure that no one faces hunger. — Sonia Gandhi, Congress presidentFlagging chronic food shortages across the country, especially among the poor, Gandhi said: “I welcome your decision to provide free of cost, 5-kg grain per person in addition to the entitlements under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) from April-June, 2020. However, given the adverse impact of the lockdown and its prolonged impact on people’s livelihoods, the provision of 10-kg grain per person to NFSA beneficiaries must be extended for an additional period of three months till September, 2020.”Gandhi said due to economic distress faced by beneficiaries, the food entitlements may be provided free of cost. The Congress chief said 10-kg grain per person should also be provided free of cost for six months to those who may be facing food insecurity but not holding ration cards.“All migrant labour who have been facing acute distress may not be holding NFSA cards. In addition, many deserving people have been excluded from the NFSA lists. The current crisis has pushed many relatively food secure families into food insecurity and poverty. Population increases since 2011 have not been considered for determining each the state’s entitlement under NFSA,” she reasoned.Gandhi said the measures she suggested were critical to safeguard people against food inflation, at a juncture where supply chain disruptions are causing price rise.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/give-free-ration-to-even-those-without-cards-sonia-to-pm-70735

In fact, sources draw attention to the PM speaking with Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin-Salman as early as March 17.When Indian missions reported signs of restiveness among expatriate community, the PM conducted Gulf diplomacy in two stages. While remaining in touch with Saudi Arabia, the dominant power in the six-member GCC, the PM spoke to leaders of Abu Dhabi and Qatar on March 26. This was followed by phone calls to the rulers of Oman, Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar.Indian workers live in hutments and with a rudimentary public health infrastructure in all Arab countries, sources here apprehend there could be a clamour to get out, if there is a turn in Covid situation in areas where they live.That is the reason behind India stepping up medical diplomacy. A 15-member medical team is already in Kuwait to train its medical staff and thus increase its capability to independently handle the outbreak. India has also lined up several of these countries as the first recipients of hydroxycholorquine (HCQ).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-medical-diplomacy-in-gulf-to-stave-off-exodus-70716
