However, it also posed an opportunity for South Asia to strengthen health systems, he said, according to a Pakistan Foreign Office statement.“The Health Ministers’ video conference was a reaffirmation of Pakistan’s commitment to the SAARC process and its efforts to forge closer cooperation among member states in situations such as the Covid pandemic," the statement added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-takes-part-in-pak-organised-virtual-meet-on-covid-19-75157
23-04-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 infection rate in India has slowed down to ‘flatten the curve’: Govt||Striking a positive note on the COVID-19 situation in India, the Centre on Thursday said it has been able to slow down the infection rate to “flatten the curve” and minimise the spread during the period of the national lockdown which has entered the 30th day.As the number of coronavirus cases inches towards 23,000, top officials of the union government and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said the situation is “currently stable” and the growth of the infections has been more or less linear and not exponential, adding the testing has also been ramped up consistently though it was not enough.The lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in force since March 25 in a bid to halt the spread of the pandemic. It was extended on April 15 for another 19 days till May 3.In another positive development, the officials said despite a 24-fold increase in testing, the percentage of positive cases is not rising. “The percentage of positive cases as a ratio of testing is more or less the same as that a month ago.”Responding to a question over the prospects of India reaching the peak infection rate by May 3, ICMR Director-General Dr Balram Bhargava said, “The situation is currently going stable and you can even say that we have been able to flatten the curve. However, it is difficult to say if the peak will come.”In epidemiology, the idea of slowing the spread of virus so that fewer people need to seek treatment at any given time is known as flattening the curve.“During the 30 days of lockdown, we have been able to cut transmission, minimise spread and increase the doubling days of COVID-19. We have been able to consistently ramp up our testing and utilise our time preparing for the future in case the virus spreads further,” Environment Secretary C K Mishra, the chairman of Empowered Group Two, told a daily media briefing on the COVID-19 situation in the country.“The growth of COVID-19 cases has been more or less linear, not exponential; this indicates that the strategies we adopted have succeeded in containing the infection to a particular level. Post-imposition of lockdown, while the number of new positive cases has increased by 16 times, testing increased by 24 times,” Mishra said in his presentation.Mishra said one crucial weapon the government employed during the 30-day lockdown period is RT-PCR test to ascertain if one has contracted the disease or not. RT-PCR, which is a nose and throat swab test, still remains the gold standard for COVID-19 testing.As on March 23, nearly 15,000 tests were done across the country and by April 22 more than 5 lakh tests were conducted, which is about “33 times in 30 days”, he said, adding, “But we are conscious of the fact that this is not enough and we have to continuously ramp up testing in the country and we will do that.”Mishra also said India has done better than a majority of developed countries with respect to the percentage of test cases yielding positive results.“We need to evolve our strategy based on the current position... We seem to be doing well so far with our strategy which is intensely focused on areas where we see a lot of positivity and action happening. Our testing strategy has been focused, targeted and continues to expand,” he said.In its latest update, the union health ministry put the total number of cases at 21,700 after the infections recorded a jump of nearly 1,250 in the last 24 hours and the death toll at 686.The ministry also said 4,325 people have so far recovered from the infection, which is about 20 per cent of the total cases, since the first case was detected in Kerala on January 30.Mishra also said that in the last one month, the number of dedicated hospitals for treating coronavirus patients has been increased 3.5 times and the number of isolation beds rose by 3.6 times.Giving a rough comparison of testing figures with other countries in his presentation, Mishra said the US had done 5 lakh tests on March 26 and had found 80,000 cases to be positive, Italy had crossed the mark on March 31 and 1 lakh were found positive, the UK reached the stage on April 20 and found 1,20,000 positive cases while Turkey had done 5 lakh tests on April 16 and 80,000 were found to be infected.“We are today at half-million mark, India had conducted around 5 Lakh tests as on April 22 and had around 20,000 cases.“So if we do a worldwide comparison, we seem to be doing well so far with our strategy which is intensely focused on areas where we see a lot of positivity and action happening,” he noted.“Of course there are other countries like South Korea which has done better than this. Our testing strategy has been focused, targeted and continues to expand.”Talking about the preparedness in terms of infrastructure, the official said the number of dedicated COVID hospitals has increased 3.5 times since last month and the number of isolation beds has increased by 3.6 times during the same period.About 3,773 dedicated COVID hospitals, health centres and care centres with capacity of 1,94,026 isolation beds, 24,644 ICU beds and 12,371 ventilators have been readied across the country. “This is augmented every day,” he said.“So we want to create a structure where we test most people, treat them according to the need and then ensure we are able to cure them and save lives,” Mishra asserted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-infection-rate-in-india-has-slowed-down-to-flatten-the-curve-govt-75156

The value of the yellow metal has risen over 40% in the last year alone. During economic uncertainty, it is generally a safe and profitable investment; therefore, the outlook for gold remains positive in the near term,” says Bhatt.Meanwhile, according to Rahul Gupta from the Emkay Global Financial Services due to the lockdown, Akshaya Tritiya may see a “subdued demand in gold”.“However, the economic uncertainty and recessionary impact of coronavirus in global economy will push the overall gold prices higher,” he said.“Technically, intermediate corrections will be seen on gold but the trend will remain positive until prices trade above 44,000 in the domestic markets. Expect prices to test 47300/48550 levels until then,” Gupta adds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-akshaya-tritiya-around-the-corner-experts-pitch-for-centuries-old-popular-gold-75149

She also accused the Governor of “transgressing basic norms of decency between two constitutional functionaries”.In a strongly worded letter to the Governor, Mamata accused Dhankhar of attacking her and her ministers and officers.Reproducing an SMS Dhankhar had sent her, Mamata said the tone and tenor of the message was “unparliamentary”.“Repeated and consistent interference in the administration” by Dhankhar amounts to “flagrant transgression of constitutional dharma”, wrote Mamata.  The Chief Minister further stated that Dhankhar’s “expostulation” left her with no choice but to release the letter in the public domain so that people of the state and the country could judge for themselves who had failed to maintain “elementary norms of constitutional behaviour”.Mamata pointed that while the SMS sent yesterday by Dhankhar gave the impression that the Chief Minister had improperly responded to a letter sent to her by the Governor on Monday, nothing could be far from the truth.While writing to the Chief Minister on Monday, Dhankhar had expressed concern about the state’s alleged reluctance to avail the free ration scheme announced by the Union Finance Minister.Dhankhar had also raised the issue of alleged corruption in the public distribution system. He also pulled up Mamata for shortage of corona testing kits in the state.“I took up the matter with the Union Health Minister only to be informed that ‘there is disconnect in your figures and we have adequate kits awaiting distribution by the state’,” Dhankhar had wrote to the CM.The Governor had then urged Mamata to “spare time to engage” with him.In her reply, Mamata had thanked the Governor but politely turned down his invitation, saying that “you would, no doubt, appreciate that the entire state machinery is now engaged to fight against COVID-19 pandemic”.Citing portions from BR Ambedkar’s speech in the Constituent Assembly in 1949 and recommendations made by the Sarkaria Commission, Mamata cautioned the Governor against “overstepping” his limits.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-lashes-out-at-west-bengal-governor-75144

It is sad that the Congress has once again shown it is the party that imposed Emergency on the country. By attacking the journalist it has kept up with its tradition of silencing free speech,” Hussain said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-accuses-sonia-of-spreading-communal-hatred-seeks-apology-75142

Between April 1, 2020 and April 22, the total food grains loaded and transported by Indian Railways was 4.58 million tonnes as compared to 1.82 million tonnes in the corresponding period last year.The Railways have been moving food grains through its freight services during the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19, bringing food to kitchens across India.The previous single day record for loading of food grain was 92 rakes (2.57 lakh tonnes) on April 9, 2020.Efforts have been made to ensure that farm products like food grains are picked up on time and also to ensure timely supply during the nationwide lockdown. The loading, transportation and unloading of these essential commodities has been in progress in full swing during the lockdown period. Close association is being maintained with Ministry of Agriculture.Stocks of wheat and paddy (rice) are maintained by the Food Corporation of India.Major loading stations during the lockdown period are Karnal, Kurukshetra, Rohtak, Jind, Moga, Amritsar, Muktsar and Ludhiana.Loading is also being done from Uttar Pradesh—Barabanki, Lucknow, Sultanpur, Chandauli, Varanasi besides Badli in Delhi, Dehradun in Uttarakhand.The need for loading more rakes arose after the government announced to provide additional 5 kg food grain per person to NFSA beneficiaries.Deficient states are permitted to lift three months’ stock from Food Corporation of India on credit hence the rush.Not just the speedy despatch of these food grain rakes, the other issue is of managing adequate supply of empty covered rakes from across the country and moving them to Punjab and Haryana.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/railways-sets-record-lifts-3-13-lakh-tonnes-of-food-grain-in-single-day-75140

Namaz and Tarabi(ritual prayer) should be offered at home. Care should be taken that not more than three-four people read Tarabi because large numbers can be harmful for the families and the society in view of the pandemic,” Bukhari said.The holy month of Ramzan marked by fasting by followers of Islam is expected to start from Saturday as per the lunar calendar.Shahi Imam of Fatehpuri Masjid Mufti Mukarram Ahmed said those who are under quarantine and unable to observe ‘Roza’ (fast) can compensate for it through ‘Qaza’.Such persons can observe fast later on, he said.Ahmed urged authorities to make necessary arrangements so that people in Muslim-dominated areas could go out in the evenings and early mornings to buy food items to break fasts during Ramzan.“Lockdown has been imposed due to coronavirus and people have been restricted to their homes. But during Ramzan, authorities should allow shops and vendors in Muslim areas so those observing ‘Roza’ could buy food for Iftari and Sehri,” he said.The mosques in Delhi are shut due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus.The Delhi Waqf Board that administers over 200 mosques in the city has already issued an advisory for imams regarding Ramzan.It has asked imams to disseminate official guidelines for coronavirus containment through loudspeakers.

Those found negative should be allowed to go back home, they had said.However, Chenoy opposed their PIL terming it "laughable" and "preposterous" as it might lead to spread of COVID19 and would defeat the very purpose of lockdown.During the hearing of another PIL, the Centre had recently told the top court that close to seven lakh migrant workers had been accommodated in more than 21,000 temporary shelters across India and they were being given food and medical facilities. It had said their march was halted to prevent the spread of the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-sc-opposes-shifting-of-migrants-to-their-native-places-75124

They also enquired about the problems, if any, that the health staff are facing,” a senior official said.The second central team in North Bengal, however, is yet to begin its field visits, the official said.The team at North Bengal, led by Vineet Joshi, a senior official of HRD ministry, met health officials, including the Jalpaiguri district’s chief medical officer (CMOH), and took stock of the situation.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier slammed the Centre for sending teams to look into West Bengal’s preparedness for tackling the COVID-19 outbreak and alleged that faulty testing kits were dispatched to the state.There has been a war of words between the West Bengal and the Union governments over the arrival of two central teams in the state to assess the coronavirus situation.

23-04-2020||Bengaluru||Coronavirus pandemic: Lockdown norms partially relaxed in Karnataka||The Karnataka government has partially relaxed COVID-19 lockdown norms in the state allowing IT and IT-enabled services to operate with essential minimum staff and also certain construction activities, manufacturing of packaging materials, courier services, among others from Thursday.The activities will be permitted only outside the COVID-19 containment zones identified by the government.There were reports of some large-scale traffic movement in some parts of the city this morning as lockdown curbs were relaxed.“To mitigate hardship to the public, select additional activities have been allowed,which will come into effect from 00.00 hours of April 23,” Chief Secretary TM Vijay Bhaskar had said in an order on Wednesday.However, these additional activities will be operationalised by District Administrations and BBMP (city corporation in the case of Bengaluru city) based on strict compliance to the guidelines on lockdown measures, it said.Before operationalising these relaxations, district administrations and BBMP (city corporation) shall ensure that all the preparatory arrangements on social distancing in offices, work place establishments as also sectoral requirements are in place, it added.IT and IT-enabled services will be allowed to operate with essential minimum staff only while the rest would work from home.Official sources said, IT companies will work on essential staff required to work from office spaces and will mobilise them.Earlier on April 18, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa, hours after announcing that IT/BT companies can resume operations with 33 per cent strength after April 20, had rolled it back, citing public opinion as the reason.Facing a financial crunch, the state government has been eager to kick-start economic activities in the state that had come to halt due to the coronavirus lockdown.There were reports of some large-scale traffic movement being noticed in some parts of the city this morning, which came in for criticism from the Karnataka Congress.“Announcement of partial relief to ease lockdown by @BSYBJP has created chaos in #Bengaluru today. Massive traffic jams are reported across city with confusions & no proper guidelines. This shows lack of co-ordination in Governance with improper planning,” the opposition party in the state tweeted.While hospitality services, bars, malls, theatres, shopping complexes, religious and places of worship among others will continue to remain shut, according to Wednesday’s order, relaxation of norms would be for activities that are linked to essential services such as health, infrastructure and agriculture.As per the order, while, public transportation will continue to remain suspended till May 3, private vehicles with passes for emergency services and personnel commuting with passes to places of work and back will be allowed.Services provided by self-employed people like electrician, IT repair, plumbers, motor mechanics and carpenters in local areas have also been given exemption.Tea, coffee and rubber plantations have been allowed to work with 50 per cent workforce, and a similar exemption have been given to processing, packaging, sale and marketing of these produce.Activities permitted include construction of roads, irrigation projects, buildings and all kinds of industrial projects, including MSMEs, in rural areas and all kinds of projects in industrial estates, where workers are available on site and no one is required to be brought in from outside.Also permitted to function are manufacturing units of essential goods - drugs, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, their raw materials and intermediates; food processing industries in rural areas, coal production (mines and mineral production and activities incidental to mining) besides manufacturing units of packaging materials.

A decision on the census will be taken only after things become clear on the coronavirus situation and the lockdown, Chief Conservator of Forest, Junagadh division, D T Vasavda told PTI.Initially, it was decided to conduct the census in May and then it was postponed to June, but now it all depends on the situation, he said.The Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, which is the only abode of Asiatic lions, remains closed during the monsoon season from June-end to October, which is also the mating period of big cats, another official said, adding that the census is most unlikely at that time.During the last census conducted in May 2015, 523 lions were found in the Gir forest.The state has succeeded in conserving lions in the Gir forest, where their numbers dwindled to just over a dozen in the early 20th century.The erstwhile Nawab of Junagadh, Mahabat Khan, had then banned shooting of lions.Due to conservation efforts of the state authorities after Independence, the number of wild cats has steadily gone up in Gir.At present, lions are found in seven districts - Junagadh, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Gir Somnath, Botad, Porbandar and Rajkot - surrounding the Gir forest area.At times, they stray into farms in these districts and sometimes enter cities and towns located on the periphery of the sanctuary.Two years backs, lions in Gir faced a threat of infectious diseases.The state government in February last year said as many as 34 lions died in 2018 due to various diseases, including the canine distemper virus.

Additional instalments of DA and DR from July 1 2020 and January 1, 2021 shall also not be paid,” the government said in a memorandum.It, however, assured that the DA and DR at current rates will continue to be paid.In the memo, the government also said that as and when the decision to release the future instalment of DA and DR, due from July 2021, is taken by the government, “the rates will be restored prospectively and will be subsumed in the cumulative revised rate effective from July 1, 2021.”“The government will not pay any arrears for the period in between January 1 2020 and June 30, 2021,” it added.The Union Cabinet had hiked the DA and DR by 4 per cent from 17 per cent of the basic pay/pension to 21 per cent of basic pay/pension for central government employees and pensioners last month.There are at least 50 lakh government employees and 65 lakh pensioners. The DA and DR hike would have cost the exchequer Rs37,530 crore in the current and the next financial year.The government, in one of its recent orders, assured that it was not making any cuts in central government pensions to the eligible public at large and also salaries and pensions of government employees and pensioners will not be affected by its cash management instructions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-not-to-pay-additional-instalment-of-da-to-employees-75102

23-04-2020||Washington||Lockdown in India has impacted 40 million internal migrants: World Bank||The nationwide lockdown in India which started about a month ago has impacted nearly 40 million internal migrants, the World Bank has said.“The lockdown in India has impacted the livelihoods of a large proportion of the country’s nearly 40 million internal migrants. Around 50,000–60,000 moved from urban centres to rural areas of origin in the span of a few days,” the Bank said in a report released on Wednesday.According to the report—‘COVID-19 Crisis Through a Migration Lens’—the magnitude of internal migration is about two-and-a-half times that of international migration.“Lockdowns, loss of employment, and social distancing prompted a chaotic and painful process of mass return for internal migrants in India and many countries in Latin America,” it said. Thus, the COVID-19 containment measures might have contributed to spreading the epidemic, the report said.Governments need to address the challenges facing internal migrants by including them in health services and cash transfer and other social programmes, and protecting them from discrimination, it said.World Bank said that coronavirus crisis has affected both international and internal migration in the South Asia region. As the early phases of the crisis unfolded, many international migrants, especially from the Gulf countries, returned to countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh – until travel restrictions halted these flows.Some migrants had to be evacuated by governments, such as those of China and Iran, it said. Before the coronavirus crisis, migrant outflows from the region were robust, the report said.The number of recorded, primarily low-skilled emigrants from India and Pakistan rose in 2019 relative to the prior year but is expected to decline in 2020 due to the pandemic and oil price declines impacting the Gulf countries. In India, the number of low-skilled emigrants seeking mandatory clearance for emigration rose slightly by eight percent to 3,68,048 in 2019.In Pakistan, the number of emigrants jumped 63 per cent to 6,25,203 in 2019, largely due to a doubling of emigration to Saudi Arabia, it said. According to the World Bank, migration flows are likely to fall, but the stock of international migrants may not decrease immediately, since migrants cannot return to their countries due to travel bans and disruption to transportation services.In 2019, there were around 272 million international migrants. The rate of voluntary return migration is likely to fall, except in the case of a few cross-border migration corridors in the South (such as Venezuela-Colombia, Nepal-India, Zimbabwe–South Africa, Myanmar-Thailand), it said. Migrant workers tend to be vulnerable to the loss of employment and wages during an economic crisis in their host country, more so than native-born workers.      Lockdowns in labour camps and dormitories can also increase the risk of contagion among migrant workers. “Many migrants have been stranded due to the suspension of transport services. Some host countries have granted visa extensions and temporary amnesty to migrant workers, and some have suspended the involuntary return of migrants,” it said. Observing that government policy responses to the COVID-19 crisis have largely excluded migrants and their families back home, the World Bank said there is a strong case for including migrants in the near-term health strategies of all countries, given the externalities associated with the health status of an entire population in the face of a highly contagious pandemic. The Bank said governments would do well to consider short, medium and long-term interventions to support stranded migrants, remittance infrastructure, loss of subsistence income for families back home, and access to health, housing, education, and jobs for migrant workers in host/transit countries and their families back home. The pandemic has also highlighted the global shortage of health professionals and an urgent need for global cooperation and long-term investments in medical training, it said.

23-04-2020||New Delhi||Hard for elected govt to have 'political will' to meet with challenges of reservation: SC||It is very hard for an elected government to have the “political will” to meet the challenges arising out of the reservation scenario wherein neither the lists of those entitled have been reviewed nor the quota provisions have come to an end, the Supreme Court has observed.The apex court noted that the government is required to revise the lists for providing quota so that benefits trickle down to the needy.It said reservations are provided due to discrimination and disadvantages suffered by the backward classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for “sharing the state power”.“It was envisaged that social disparities, economic and backwardness should be wiped out within a period of 10 years, but gradually, amendments have been made, and there is no review of the lists nor the provisions of the reservation have come to an end,” said a five-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra.“Instead, there is a demand to increase them and to provide reservations within the reservation. It is very hard for any elected government to have the political will to meet with the challenges arising out of the aforesaid scenario,” said the bench, also comprising Justices Indira Banerjee, Vineet Saran, M R Shah and Aniruddha Bose.The top court observed this in its 152-page verdict by which it quashed the January 2000 order of the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh, which had provided 100 per cent reservation to the Scheduled Tribe candidates for post of teachers in schools in the scheduled areas.The bench said that reservation provided to Scheduled Tribes and constitution of scheduled areas is for the reason that systems concerning way of life are different as they were in “isolation” and “differed in various aspects from common civilisation” such as delivery of justice, culture and way of life.“The formal education, by and large, failed to reach them, and they remained a disadvantaged class, as such required a helping hand to uplift them and to make them contribute to the national development and not to remain part of the primitive culture,” it said.“The purpose of the constitutional provisions is not to keep them in isolation but to make them part of the mainstream. They are not supposed to be seen as a human zoo and source of enjoyment of primitive culture and for dance performances,” it said.The bench further said that social, economic upliftment and education are necessary for the tribals to make them equal.Referring to the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgement, which is popularly called the Mandal Commission verdict, the apex court noted it was held that the State Lists adopted to provide reservations are not meant to be sacrosanct and unalterable.“Now there is a cry within the reserved classes. By now, there are affluent and socially and economically advanced classes within Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. There is voice by deprived persons of social upliftment of some of the Scheduled Castes/Tribes, but they still do not permit benefits to trickle down to the needy,” it said.“Thus, there is a struggle within, as to worthiness for entitlement within reserved classes of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and other backward classes,” the bench said.It agreed with the submissions that the government is required to revise the lists and said it can be done presently without disturbing the percentage of reservation so that benefits trickle down to the needy and are not usurped by those classes who have come up after obtaining the benefits for the last 70 years or after their inclusion in the list.  Dealing with the January 2000 order of the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh, the bench said it was “arbitrary” and “not permissible” under the Constitution. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hard-for-elected-govt-to-have-political-will-to-meet-with-challenges-of-reservation-sc-75085
23-04-2020||New Delhi||Sharing location, video calls in HC bail conditions to track prisoners on bail during lockdown||Sharing of location through Google Maps and marking presence on video call are some of the bail conditions put up by the Delhi High Court to keep track of prisoners who are being released during the coronavirus pandemic to decongest jails.In three separate orders granting interim suspension of sentences, Justice Anup J Bhambhani has directed the three convicts to make a video call every Friday to the police officer concerned and also ‘drop-a-pin’ on Google Maps so that the officer can verify the prisoner’s presence and location.The court passed the orders keeping in view the “unprecedented circumstances of a public health emergency” that prevail today and the consequent need to “decongest prisons for the overall medical safety of all prisoners”.Those who were released are a 73-year-old retired school teacher, a 21-year-old man and an ATM van driver in cases of a minor’s rape, rash and negligent driving and defalcation of Rs 51 lakh cash respectively.“The appellant (convict) will make a video-call every Friday between 11 am and 11:30 am to the Investigating Officer, and in case the Investigating Officer is no longer in service or is otherwise unavailable, then to the SHO of the Police Station where the case was registered and also ‘drop-a-pin’ on Google maps, so that the IO/SHO can verify the appellant’s presence and location.“Counsel for the appellant has confirmed that the appellant has the wherewithal to comply with this condition,” the judge said in the three orders.The court also asked the convicts to furnish their mobile number with the jail superintendent and ensure that the number is kept active and switched on at all times.The retired teacher sought suspension of his sentence on health grounds, including diabetes, hypertension and asthma, and said his past medical condition puts him in a vulnerable category that makes it medically unsafe for him to remain in prison in the present circumstances of the prevalent public health emergency.The prosecutor opposed the plea saying the man was convicted under the POCSO Act for raping a minor and was sentenced to 10 years in jail.The court, while noting that he has only been in jail since February 24 and that he has been convicted of heinous offences under the POCSO Act, suspended his sentence for three months considering the prevailing unprecedented circumstances of a public health emergency that is coronavirus.In the second case where the man was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for offences of rash and negligent driving and causing death by rash or negligent act, the high court suspended his sentence till July 14. While driving a car, he had hit a two-wheeler causing grievous injuries to the scooterist and death of a woman pillion rider.He was directed by the trial court to pay Rs one lakh to the family of the deceased and Rs 50,000 to the injured.He had sought bail suspension of his sentence saying that in view of the prevalent serious public health emergency, he being a young man, would be exposed to avoidable and grave health risk in prison.The van driver, serving eight years’ jail term for robbery and causing grievous hurt to other persons who were accompanying him in the van by administering intoxicating food, had sought suspension of his sentence by two months.He sought to be released saying his family consisting of his wife and three minor children were in dire circumstances and they were facing financial issues in his absence.The high court suspended his sentence for 45 days noting that he has served almost half his punishment in prison and in view of the dire need of decongesting prisons due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The court directed the three convicts not to indulge in any act that would prejudice the proceedings in the appeal and asked them to surrender before the concerned jail superintendent on expiry of the period of interim suspension of sentence. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sharing-location-video-calls-in-hc-bail-conditions-to-track-prisoners-on-bail-during-lockdown-75084

Goswami’s Republic Television said both the accused were workers of the Congress party.The accused have been identified as office-bearers of the Youth Congress in the Sion-Koliwada Assembly constituency. Mishra is the general secretary of the Sion-Koliwada Youth Congress and Borade is the president.“Two men on a motorcycle overtook my car and tried to identify who was driving. They then blocked the path of my car with their two-wheeler.  The pillion rider hit the right side driver window several times and after realising that the car windows were up, the pillion rider removed a liquid bottle from his pocket and threw liquid on the driver’s side of the car where I was sitting,” Goswami said in his complaint with the police.The television anchor, who has been ranting against Congress president Sonia Gandhi for the lynching of two sadhus outside Mumbai last weekend, blamed her for the attack on his car.The Maharashtra unit of the Congress party, however, condemned the attack on Goswami.“I don’t think that any Congress worker would have attacked him because the Congress does not work like this,” Maharashtra Energy Minister Nitin Raut said in a statement.He, however, hit out at Goswami for his attack on Sonia Gandhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arnab-goswamis-car-attacked-in-mumbai-2-held-75063
23-04-2020||Aditi Tandon||Punjab sought 1 lakh rapid testing kits, got only 10,000 of Chinese make: Capt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 23Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday said resources of Rs 4,400 crore of GST have still not been released by the Central Government.Speaking at the Congress working committee meeting, he said,  “In place of 1 lakh rapid testing kits, we have received only 10,000 of Chinese make. Their authenticity is to be tested still.”Congress president Sonia Gandhi addressed the party’s working committee meeting and accused the BJP of spreading communal hatred when the country should be fighting the Covid together.“It should worry every Indian that when we should be tackling the corona virus united, the BJP continues to spread the virus of communal prejudice and hatred. Grave damage has been done to our social harmony. Our party will have to work hard to repair that damage,” Sonia said at a virtual CWC meeting days after a mob lynching incident killed two sadhus and a driver in Maharashtra’s Palghar leading to a war of words between the BJP and Congress.She criticised the government on all fronts saying the government was clueless about the post May 3 strategy, testing hadn’t been enhanced and protective gear for doctors was inadequate and of poor quality. The Congress chief also said the poor and migrants continued to be the worst hit and 12 crore jobs had been lost in the first phase of the lockdown.”Since our meeting three weeks ago, the pandemic has increased disturbingly - both in spread and speed. The lockdown continues and all sections of society continue to face acute hardship and distress—particularly our kisans and khet mazdoors, migrant labour, construction workers and workers in the unorganised sector,” she said, adding that trade and industry had come to a halt and crores of livelihoods destroyed.Gandhi said the Central Government did not appear to have a clear idea on how the situation will be managed after May 3.“A lockdown of the present nature after that date would be even more devastating,” she said to a meeting attended by former PM Manmohan Singh and other senior CWC members including Rahul Gandhi.Mentioning her letters to the PM, Sonia said her suggestions had been implemented partially and in a miserly way.”Unfortunately, the suggestions we gave have been acted upon only partially and in a miserly way. The compassion, large-heartedness and alacrity that should be forthcoming from the Central Government is conspicuous by its absence,” Sonia alleged.She called for focus engaging with health, food security and livelihood issues. On testing, Gandhi said it still remained low and testing kits are still in short supply and of poor quality.“PPE kits are being provided to our health care workers but the number and quality is poor. Entitlement of foodgrains under the National Food Security Act has not yet reached the beneficiaries,” she said.Gandhi reiterated the Congress demand of providing 10 kg of foodgrains, 1 kg of pulses and half a kg of sugar to each person of the family every month.Flagging 12 crore job losses in the first phase of the lockdown, she said unemployment was likely to increase further as economic activity remained at a standstill.“It is imperative to provide at least Rs 7,500 to each family to tide over this crisis. Migrant labourers are still stranded, jobless and desperate to return home. They have been hit the hardest. They must be provided with food security and a financial safety net,” the Congress chief said.She demanded necessary facilities to farmers for the next round of kharif crops which will begin in the coming two months and a special MSME package since the sector employs 11 crore personnel and makes up one third of the GDP. Gandhi also alleged that funds legitimately owed to “our” (Congress-ruled) states had been held back.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-sought-1-lakh-rapid-testing-kits-got-only-10-000-of-chinese-make-capt-75057

23-04-2020||London||COVID-19: Indians among worst affected ethnic groups in England||People of Indian origin in the UK have emerged as the worst affected ethnic group from the coronavirus pandemic, according to an official data on COVID-19 deaths in hospitals across England.Figures released this week by the National Health Service (NHS) England show that of the 13,918 patients who died in hospitals till April 17 after testing positive for the novel coronavirus, 16.2 per cent were of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background and those identifying with Indian ethnicity made up 3 per cent of that.This was followed by Caribbeans as the second-largest ethnic group affected in the COVID-19 death toll at 2.9 per cent, followed by Pakistanis at 2.1 per cent.The data, only a limited snapshot of the UK-wide COVID-19 tests, follows the British government's announcement of a review into the coronavirus death toll disparity among the BAME population."We have seen, both across the population as a whole but in those who work in the NHS, a much higher proportion who've died from minority backgrounds and that really worries me," said UK health secretary Matt Hancock while launching the review last week.The proportion of deaths among BAME groups is much higher compared to their roughly 13 per cent make-up of the total population.A further breakdown shows COVID-19 deaths among those identifying with white ethnicity at 73.6 per cent and mixed ethnicity at 0.7 per cent.Of the 16.2 per cent BAME figures, those of Bangladeshi ethnicity are at 0.6 per cent, any other Asian background 1.6 per cent, African 1.9 per cent, any other black background 0.9 per cent, Chinese 0.4 per cent and any other ethnic group 2.8 per cent."The government must take every necessary step to address this devastating disparity and protect all sectors of the population equally and now," said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, Council Chair of the British Medical Association (BMA), the doctors' union lobbying for the review."It also means taking vital steps now to protect our BAME communities until we can develop a detailed understanding of the threats they face. This could include that those at greatest risk, including older and retired doctors, are not working in potentially infectious settings," he said.Meanwhile, an analysis of the COVID-19 death toll data for NHS workers, which stands at 69, also reveals a higher proportion of BAME casualties – including the death of Dr Manjeet Singh Riyat, the UK's first Sikh emergency medicine consultant, this week.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO) recently announced a new academic tie-up with the Imperial College London to set up a research forum to delve deeper into this disparity within the medical profession in the UK."This research has the potential to give data required to delineate vulnerable groups in the pandemic and give clear advice on how to reduce the impact on the BAME population," BAPIO president Dr Ramesh Mehta said.The new study also aims at establishing a new research database as a national resource for the scientific communities to support other studies to improve the future wellbeing of NHS healthcare staff.According to experts, the reasons behind the disproportionately high coronavirus mortality rates for the ethnic minority population of the UK is likely to be down to a complex set of factors, including greater propensity among some ethnicities for heart disease and diabetes, specific vitamin deficiencies, the lack of social distancing measures within multi-generational family setting or a genetic predisposition.The government's review is aimed at collating enough data to look into measures that would minimise the risk for these communities.

If you (developed nations) are not helping the poor and continuing without changing your existing lifestyles, you cannot achieve sustainable development,” said Javadekar.He said he would raise the issue at the upcoming Petersberg Climate Dialogue. “In 2009, the world had agreed that developed countries will mobilise 100 billion dollars every year for climate adaptation and mitigation. It has been 11 years and the amount is 1 trillion now. Where is the money?” he said.“Next week I am participating in the Petersburg Climate dialogue where I will raise this issue. Yes, we have a pandemic and the economy is affected. There can be a little delay on action but we have to accept the new lifestyle,” said Javadekar.He said the pandemic had shown that the world needed to think over the way people were living. “People have realised the importance of sustainable development in the past one month after seeing clean rivers, green flora and fauna, and clear skies. That is how we used to live in villages before we created cities,” said the minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/javadekar-reminds-developed-nations-of-broken-promises-75032

Investigation will be completed in 30 days and case decided in a year.Most importantly, the ordinance provides that the perpetrator of grievous assault on epidemic warriors would be presumed guilty unless proven otherwise.The ordinance further says that anyone who damages property – a vehicle or a clinic, etc – of an epidemic warrior – would be made to pay compensation to the victim. This compensation would be twice the market value of the damaged property.No Green Card for 60 days, says TrumpThis order will only apply to individuals seeking permanent residency, in other words, those receiving Green Card.
