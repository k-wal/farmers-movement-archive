It is necessary that we should all follow lockdown properly, and also wash hands frequently to be save ourselves from COVID-19.”“The mother and the baby have been discharged on Wednesday morning,” he said.Khukhundu village residents Neeraja Devi and Pawan Prasad became parents of the baby boy.An elated Pawan said, “On Sunday evening, I rushed my wife to the PHC, where she delivered a handsome baby boy. I named him after Lockdown as we all are reeling under COVID-19 pandemic. In my view, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken the right step to impose lockdown in the entire nation to save us from the deadly virus.”“My boy will remind everyone to take precautions against COVID-19, to save themselves and the nation,” Pawan, who is a farmer, said.On the day of Janata Curfew, Bablu Tripathi and Ragini Tripathi became parents of the baby girl at Sohgoura village of Gorakhpur.She was named ‘Corona’ by her uncle Nitesh Tripathi.Staff nurse at the district hospital Sangita Kumari told PTI, “The baby girl was born on Janata Curfew day and we were surprised as she was named Corona by her uncle. Her uncle told us that Corona has brought unity in the country and entire country celebrated the unity by beating thaalis, so he named her niece as Corona.”“I took permission from my sister-in-law, the mother of the baby, and named her as Corona, as the girl is the symbol of unity in the fight against novel corona virus,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-families-name-babies-corona-and-lockdown-64183

India is also accepting donations such as protective clothes, masks, respirators and ventilators from independent sources like Jack Ma and Alibaba Foundation.Chinese state-owned companies are also providing assistance to their Indian partners, according to Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong.In China, the Indian mission and its consulates are also actively looking for personal protection equipment (PPE) which is in “huge shortage” in India, according to sources.While India is inclined to a discussion on Covid epidemic at the UN Security Council (UNSC), it is aware of the fact that the opinion of five permanent members is decisive.Hence, it is continuing to step up regional and global coordination efforts.Having operationalised the SAARC Covid Emergency Fund announced by PM Narendra Modi at a virtual summit on March 15, SAARC will hold a teleconference this weekend among its commerce ministers to tackle challenges on the trade front.This was an aspect that was also discussed by Pompeo and Jaishankar.“Our close cooperation is imperative to combat the coronavirus, including strengthening global pharmaceutical and healthcare manufacturing and supply chains,” Pompeo had said, according to the US State Department.India has so far evacuated 2,500 of its citizens besides arranging for the return of another 1,600 who were stuck at the airports. It has also sent about 5,000 foreign nationals and more are expected to leave in the coming days.The first India-US collaboration in vaccine development was for rotavirus, the most common cause of severe diarrheal diseases in children worldwide.It began in 1990 and led to the production and supply of over three crore doses of Rotovac vaccine to children in India.Among those who contributed technical, manufacturing and financial resources toward vaccine development were Society for Applied Studies, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, AIIMS (India), IISc (India), Department of Biotechnology (India), Stanford University School of Medicine, Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), Bharat Biotech, UK Department for International Development and the Research Council of Norway.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-us-keen-to-develop-vaccine-with-india-more-saarc-virtual-meets-on-cards-64181

The agency said it has registered the case under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and under the provisions of Section 6 (8) of the NIA Act and started an investigation into the recent attack.On March 25, unknown gunmen had stormed into a Gurdwara in the Shor Bazar area in Kabul and fired indiscriminately, killing 27 devotees and injuring several others. An Indian citizen Tian Singh, a resident of Delhi's Greater Kailash Part-1, was also killed in the attack.About 150 persons were inside the Gurdwara when the attack took place. The proscribed terrorist organisation, Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), had claimed the responsibility for the attack.In an official statement the NIA said as per the preliminary investigation, one Muhsin from Trikkaripur, Kasargod, Kerala, and others who had joined ISKP, are suspected to have been involved in the attack.This is the first case of its kind which NIA has registered as the recent amendments in the NIA Act, which empowered the agency to investigate terror cases that are committed at any place outside India against the Indian citizens or affecting the interest of India.Sources said the NIA will immediately start with the technical part of the investigation as suspected suicide attacker Mushin’s family had received a message on Telegram from Islamic State, informing them of his death.Noting that in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak, there may not be an immediate foreign travel, sources in the agency said the investigations will begin from India and in due course Afghanistan police and authorities would be contacted. “A team of NIA would be sent but it is not needed in these circumstances. And would be at a much later stage,” sources in the NIA said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-registers-case-to-investigate-kabul-gurdwara-attack-64179
01-04-2020||---||Coroanvirus: PM-CARES fund set up on ‘popular demand’||New Delhi, April 1 The public charitable trust “PM-CARES” was set up in view of several spontaneous requests from India and abroad for making generous contribution to support the Government in its fight against Covid-19, said sources here.Questions have been raised about the need to set up a separate fund when the Prime Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund served the purpose for all disasters in the past.The trust, said the sources, will accept donations both from India and abroad. “In view of the interest expressed to contribute to Government’s efforts, as well as keeping in mind the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, contributions to the Trust can be done by individuals and organisations, both in India and abroad,” they observed.The government on Wednesday night issued an ordinance to give effect to relaxation in several compliances. It also included a provision amending the Income Tax Act to enable 100 per cent deduction to donations to the PM’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARES) Fund.Thus any contribution made to the PM CARES Fund before March 31 would qualify for 80G exemption under the Income Tax Act, which allows donations made to specified relief funds and charitable institutions. The limit on deduction of 10 per cent of gross income shall also not be applicable for donations made to PM CARES Fund.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coroanvirus-pm-cares-fund-set-up-on-popular-demand-64178
01-04-2020||New Delhi||Authorities launch nationwide search for thousands who attended Tablighi-linked events||In a sweeping nationwide hunt, authorities across states have identified more than 6,000 people who attended the Nizamuddin Tablighi Jamaat congregation, the biggest coronavirus hotspot in India, as more than 375 fresh cases of infection emerged on Wednesday to take the tally to close to 1,900 with at least 55 deaths.More than 5,000 of those identified to have attended the congregation have been quarantined, including in hospitals across states, while efforts are on to trace another 2,000 including in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.The list includes foreigners as well, while some of those identified by the state authorities are yet to return from Delhi to their respective native places.Authorities attributed the big spike in the numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases largely to the Tablighi Jamaat, an orthodox Muslim society set up nearly 100 years ago by Deobandi Islamic scholar Maulana Muhammad Ilyas Khandhalawi as a religious reform movement and to spread the faith.The latest Union Health Ministry update put the nationwide tally of the confirmed COVID-19 cases at 1,637, after 376 new cases were recorded in the last 24 hours, and the death count at 38. But figures announced by different states and union territories totalled 1,894 with at least 55 deaths.The Ministry officials said cases have increased largely due to Tablighi Jamaat congregation, which took place in mid-March, and therefore technically it does not show a national trend. They urged people to follow guidelines during lockdown period and avoid congregations, including religious gatherings.Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi were among the places to report a large number of new cases.In Delhi, the authorities said coronavirus cases have risen to 152, including 53 who attended the Nizamuddin congregation.The number in Maharashtra increased by 33 to 335 on Wednesday, including 30 in Mumbai alone. The tally can increase further as nearly 5,000 quarantined persons are in the high-risk category, according to the state government.In Tamil Nadu, 110 people who returned from Tablighi Jamaat meet in Delhi have tested positive, taking the total cases in the state to 234. Additionally, at least 515 persons have been identified for having attended the Nizamuddin meet, while at least 59 of them have been quarantined. Chief Minister K Palaniswami said 1,131 men have returned to the state of the about 1,500 people who went for the event.In Telangana, 50 of the 57 positive cases had attended the gathering, while the state authorities have identified and quarantined at least 840 people linked to the event. The search is on for 160 others.In Delhi also, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said 2,361 people were evacuated from the place of the Nizamuddin congregation, out of which 617 have been admitted to hospitals for showing COVID-19 symptoms while the rest are quarantined.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said authorities are tracking mobile phones of people under quarantine to check their movement.The Centre on Wednesday also asked all states and Union Territories to launch on a “war footing” the contact tracing of all participants of the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, which has emerged as the coronavirus hotspot.In a video conference with chief secretaries and DGPs of all states and Union Territories (UTs), Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba also asked them to take action against foreigners, who participated in the missionary activities of the Tablighi Jamaat, for violation of visa conditions.In Karnataka, at least 50 foreigners have been quarantined after they were found to have attended the congregation while 12 others are said to have left the country. The state authorities have also identified 342 Indians who had attended the event, out of which nearly 200 have been quarantined.The Uttar Pradesh government has also ordered 569 people to be quarantined for having attended the congregation, while Gujarat has so far quarantined at least 85 and a massive manhunt is underway as nearly 1,500 from the state have been found to have participated in the religious gathering.Gujarat High Court, separately, also issued notice to the central and the state governments over the Nizamuddin congregation.The Uttarakhand government has also identified 26 such people, but said they were yet to return from Delhi.In Rajasthan, the government officials said 538 persons could have travelled to various parts of the state after attending the event.At least 81 Tablighi Jamaat returnees are suspected to be in Bihar, out of which 30 have been identified, while Assam has reported four new confirmed cases of the deadly virus infection all of whom had attended the Tablighi Jamaat meet.Amid heightened efforts to contain the pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra will also hold a video conference with all chief ministers on Thursday during which issues such as ways to contain the spread of COVID-19, movement of migrants and contact tracing of Tablighi Jamat participants are likely to come up for discussion, sources said.The availability of essential items will also be discussed during the conference in the wake of the ongoing nationwide lockdown, which entered the 8th day on Wednesday.In the meantime, the armed forces have made available over 9,000 hospital beds and more than 8,500 doctors and support staff across the country to deal with the rising cases of coronavirus infection, while Railways has also converted some of its coaches into isolation wards.India is also looking at South Korea, Germany and China for procurement of cutting-edge technology and adopting best practices being followed by them in successfully containing the spread of coronavirus amid looming risk of the country entering the community infection stage of the pandemic, officials said.Fresh cases of infection reported on Wednesday included some doctors and a police constable as well.More than 43,000 people have died due to COVID-19 worldwide so far since December, while more than 8.6 lakh infections have been reported so far. Nearly half of the world population is currently under partial or full lockdown, taking a big toll on the economy as well.State-wise list of people who attended TablighiSTATE/UT                                                         NO.

01-04-2020||Satya Prakash||SC directs media to publish official version about coronavirus developments||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 1 Expressing serious concern over circulation of fake news that allegedly caused panic among migrant workers leading to their mass exodus from cities to their native places, the Supreme Court has directed media platforms to publish government version about COVID-19 crisis.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde directed the Centre to arrange for within 24 hours bringing out a daily bulletin through all media avenues, including social media and forums to clear the doubts of people.“We do not intend to interfere with the free discussion about the pandemic, but direct the media refer to and publish the official version about the developments,” the Bench said on Tuesday while hearing PILs on plight of migrant workers marching towards their villages.A day after the SC order, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry on Wednesday issued an Office Memorandum and sent the order to the National Broadcasters Association, National Broadcasting Foundation and Press Council of India, besides Prasar Bharati and other government media organisations.Centre’s Status Report says the exodus of migrant labourers was triggered due to panic created by some fake/misleading news and social media reports“The migration of large number of labourers working in the cities was triggered by panic created by fake news that the lock down would continue for more than three months,” it said. “We are informed that the labourers who are unemployed due to lock down were apprehensive about their survival. Panic was created by some fake news that the lockdown would last for more than three months,” the Bench said after the Centre’s Status Report said the exodus of migrant labourers was triggered due to panic created by some fake/misleading news and social media reports.“Such panic driven migration has caused untold suffering to those who believed and acted on such news. In fact, some have lost their lives in the process,” the top court said, adding, it was “not possible for us to overlook this menace of fake news either by electronic, print or social media”.Noting that Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 provided for punishment to a person who made or circulated a false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic, it said, “Such person shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to one year or with fine.”Disobedience to an order promulgated by a public servant would result in punishment under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. An advisory which is in the nature of an order made by the public authority attracts section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, it said. “We trust and expect that all concerned viz., State Governments, Public Authorities and Citizens of this country will faithfully comply with the directives, advisories and orders issued by the Union of India in letter and spirit in the interest of public safety. “In particular, we expect the Media (print, electronic or social) to maintain a strong sense of responsibility and ensure that unverified news capable of causing panic is not disseminated,” the top court said.In its Status Report, the Centre had referred to an advisory issued by it on March 24 to the authorities to effectively deal with rumour mongering. It had requested the top court to issue directions to prevent fake and inaccurate reporting—whether intended or not, either by electronic print or social media which will cause panic in the society.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-directs-media-to-publish-official-version-about-coronavirus-developments-64175

01-04-2020||New Delhi||India switches to world’s cleanest petrol, diesel with no increase in prices||India on Wednesday joined a select league of nations having the world’s cleanest petrol and diesel as oil companies rolled out Euro-VI emission compliant fuels without either disruption or a price increase.Leapfrogging from BS-IV grade fuel straight to BS-VI grade, equivalent to Euro-VI fuel, petrol and diesel would have resulted in an up to Re 1 per litre increase in cost but oil companies decided against passing this on to consumers and instead adjusted it against the reduction warranted from international oil prices plummeting to a 17-year low.“We are today 100 per cent supplying BS-VI petrol and diesel. All the over 68,700 petrol pumps in the country are selling the cleaner fuel from today,” said Sanjiv Singh, Chairman, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) - the firm that controls roughly half of the market.He said there is no change in the retail selling price of the fuels because of the switchover.Oil companies have not changed petrol and diesel price for over a fortnight now as they first adjusted the reduction warranted against the Rs 3 per litre increase in excise duty and now are setting off the increased cost of BS-VI fuel.Petrol and diesel rates were last revised on March 16. A litre of petrol in Delhi comes for Rs 69.59 and diesel is priced at Rs 62.29.Singh said the switch over from BS-IV to BS-VI was achieved in just three years, a feat not seen in any of the large economies around the globe.India will join the select league of nations using petrol and diesel containing just 10 parts per million of sulphur as it looks to cut vehicular emissions that are said to be one of the reasons for the choking pollution in major cities.India adopted Euro-III equivalent (or Bharat Stage-III) fuel with a sulphur content of 350 ppm in 2010 and then took seven years to move to BS-IV that had a sulphur content of 50 ppm. From BS-IV to BS-VI it took just three years.“We have as oil industry stuck to the timelines given by the government for a switchover to BS-VI fuel from April 1,” Singh told PTI. “In fact, we had been supplying BS-VI fuel for almost three weeks now.”     India will join the select league of nations using petrol and diesel containing just 10 parts per million of sulphur as it looks to cut vehicular emissionsBesides IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), as well as Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) too, started supplying BS-VI grade fuel much before the April 1 deadline.While a BPCL official said the company started supplying BS-VI grade fuel from all its 16,000 petrol pumps, HPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana said the company’s refineries started production of the new grade of fuel in January and progressively all the 16,400 pumps have taken to supplying the new fuel.Singh said it was a conscious decision to leapfrog to BS-VI as first upgrading to BS-V and then shifting to BS-VI would have prolonged the journey to 4 to 6 years. Besides, oil refineries, as well as automobile manufacturers, would have had to make investments twice - first to producing BS-V grade fuel and engines and then BS-VI ones.State-owned oil refineries spent about Rs 35,000 crore to upgrade plants that could produce ultra-low sulphur fuel. This investment is on top of Rs 60,000 crore they spent on refinery upgrades in the previous switchovers.India adopted a fuel up-gradation programme in the early 1990s. Low lead gasoline (petrol) was introduced in 1994 in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. On February 1, 2000, unleaded gasoline was mandated nationwide.Similarly, BS-2000 (Euro-I equivalent, BS-1) vehicle emission norms were introduced for new vehicles from April 2000. BS-II (Euro-II equivalent) emission norms for new cars were introduced in Delhi from 2000 and extended to the other metro cities in 2001.Benzene limits have been reduced progressively from 5 per cent in 2000 to 1 per cent nationwide. Lead content in gasoline was removed in phases and only unleaded gasoline is being produced and sold from February 1, 2000.The octane number of gasoline signifies the improved performance of the engine. Loss in octane number due to phasing out of lead was made up by installing new facilities in the refinery and changes in refinery operation. RON (Research Octane Number) of gasoline for BS-2000 spec was increased to 88. This has over time been increased to 91.Singh said sulphur reduction will reduce Particulate Matter (PM) emissions even in the in-use older generation diesel vehicles. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-switches-to-worlds-cleanest-petrol-diesel-with-no-increase-in-prices-64168
01-04-2020||Vijay Mohan||IAF to procure 55,000 personal decontamination kits||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, April 1Amidst the deployment of its transport fleet in the ongoing battle against the COVID-19, the Air Force is procuring over 55,000 personal decontamination kits (PDKs) that are used for providing immediate protection in a nuclear, biological and chemical contaminated (NBC) environment.According to IAF sources, the procurement of these kits would be done in a staggered manner by taking into account the IAF’s periodic consumption and the equipment’s shelf life.Part of the procurement would be to replenish expended stocks and part to build up reserves. Procurement of the entire lot in batches is expected to take up to two years, an officer said.The IAF has deployed its C-17, C-130 and An-32 transporters to ferry medical supplies and emergency equipment to various parts of the country where they are critically required.PDKs are small, ready-to-use kits that can be worn on a waist belt or carried in cargo pockets and are used to neutralise chemical, biological or radiological agents and toxic industrial materialsIAF aircraft were also used to evacuate stranded Indian nationals from China and Iraq.“Since IAF operations require some personnel to come in contact with passengers as well as service providers at various stations in an environment where the threat of virus infection is high,” the need for precautions and being prepared for any situation while working in a biologically contaminated environment cannot be understated,” an officer said.PDKs are small, ready-to-use kits that can be worn on a waist belt or carried in cargo pockets and are used to neutralise chemical, biological or radiological agents and toxic industrial materials that have accumulated on personnel and equipment while in the field.While PDKs are not intended to replace a complete decontamination process, they can be used in emergency situations.A few years ago, the Defence Research and Development Organisation had developed a PDK for the forces, which is now being produced commercially by the private industry.Exposure to micro-organism and hazardous chemicals is not confined to the armed forces in war, but the civilian population at large too can be adversely affected and can be caught unawares at any time, as the current situation has brought out. All three services have their own full-fledged NBC warfare cells and also have at their disposal an array of equipment and materials to mitigate the threat at a large scale.The National Disaster Management Authority too has drawn up plans to cater to an NBC disaster.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iaf-to-procure-55-000-personal-decontamination-kits-64166

01-04-2020||New Delhi||What is Tablighi Jamaat and its link to coronavirus controversy||With nearly quarter of 39 deaths from COVID-19 in India being linked to a congregation of Islamic preachers at Nizamuddin in New Delhi, the organisers of the Tablighi Jamaat have come under scanner of the authorities for the alleged violation of various guidelines.What is Tablighi Jamaat?Set up nearly 100 years ago by Deobandi Islamic scholar Maulana Muhammad Ilyas Khandhalawi as a religious reform movement, the Tablighi Jamaat translates into an outreach society or a society to spread faith.A completely non-political movement, the Jamaat aims at propagating basic tenets of Islam espoused by Prophet Mohammed -- Kalimah (declaration of faith), Salat (five times prayers), Ilm-o-Zikr (knowledge), Ikraam-e-Muslim (Respect of Muslim), Ikhlas-e-Niyyat (Sincerity of intention) and Tafrigh-i-Waqt (sparing time).Considered as an influential spiritual movement in the world, the Jamaat is now understood to have been plagued with factionalism emanating from centres in Pakistan and Bangladesh.How does it function?Estimated to have 150 to 250 million members primarily in South Asia, the Jamaat members only work among Muslims teaching them ways of life practiced by Prophet Mohammed.At the congregation, various small groups of preachers are constituted with a senior among them as their leaders. These groups visit designated destinations through mosques to spread Islamic practices among Muslims.COVID-19 and Tablighi JamaatThe congregation of preachers took place in early March in Banglawali Masjid in Nizamuddin area where Markaz (headquarters) of the Jamaat is located. It is believed that over 800 foreign nationals from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Nepal, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Kyrgyzstan had attended the event.According to the government, over 2,000 foreigners from 70 countries arrived in India since January 1 to participate in Jamaat activities with over 1,000 got stuck at Nizamuddin due to the lockdown. Many of them had six-month tourist visa.Alarm bells started ringing with the death of an Indonesian citizen who had participated in the congregation and was travelling in Telangana. He was found COVID-19 positive on March 18. The Home Ministry alerted all state governments about preachers of Jamaat on March 21.The Jamaat claims that about 2,500 members were at Nizamuddin Markaz. After sudden announcement of ‘Janata Curfew’ on March 22 followed by a similar action by the Delhi Government and ultimately a 21-day lockdown announced by the Prime Minister, a large number of the Jamaat members got stuck at the Markaz while about 1,500 had left.So far 10 participants of the Tablighi Jamaat congregation, including a Filipino national have succumbed to coronavirus while 285 people staying at the Markaz were admitted to hospitals for suspected coronavirus cases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-is-tablighi-jamaat-and-its-link-to-coronavirus-controversy-64160
01-04-2020||New Delhi||Here’s a look India’s coronavirus hotspots||The government is focusing its attention on 10 ‘hotspots’ across the country in its effort to control the spread of COVID-19, which has infected more than 1,200 people and claimed at least 35 lives. There are two hotspots each in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Kerala and Maharashtra and one each in Gujarat and Rajasthan:  DELHINizamuddin West: Famed for the shrine of the 14h century Sufi mystic Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya, the south Delhi locality has emerged as an epicentre for spread of the coronavirus in different parts of the country after thousands of people took part in a Tablighi Jamaat congregation from March 1-15.Six people who died in Telangana and one in Jammu and Kashmir attended the congregation in the headquarters of the Tablighi in Nizamuddin West, a colony split between the labyrinthine lanes near the ‘dargah’ and spacious residential homes.In Delhi alone, 24 participants tested positive for the disease. Besides, 441 of the participants were hospitalised after they showed symptoms. The number is likely to swell significantly as more test reports come.Dilshad Garden: The northeast Delhi locality made headlines when a woman with a travel history to Saudi Arabia tested positive for coronavirus and infected her daughter as well as two relatives in Jehangirpuri close by.She also came in contact with a ‘mohalla’ clinic doctor in Maujpur, who was infected with the disease. The doctor, who is believed have come into contract with hundreds of people, later transmitted the infection to his wife.“So far, the number of patients in Shahadra district (Dilshad Garden falls under Shahadra district) is 11,” said a health department official.A senior health department official added that they feared the number could have spiked in Dilshad Garden but there has thankfully been no significant rise in the number of patients in the locality. It counts for about 11 per cent of Delhi’s count of more than 100 coronavirus cases.RAJASTHANBhilwara: Of the total 83 coronavirus positive cases detected in Rajasthan, 26 are from the textile town of Bhilwara. Eight patients have tested negative after treatment.Health department teams have taken 1,194 samples from Bhilwara.A massive screening exercise is underway with over 26 lakh people in urban and rural areas being screened.Two coronavirus positive deaths have taken in Bhilwara but officials maintain that they died due to co-morbid conditions.A doctor of a private hospital was the first positive case in Bhilwara. Most of the cases that have come up so far either are of hospital staff or the patient who had gone for treatment at hospitals.UTTAR PRADESHNoida: Gautam Buddh Nagar adjoining Delhi in western Uttar Pradesh has so far recorded 38 coronavirus cases, the highest for any district in the country’s most populous state.About two dozen of these cases are linked directly or indirectly to a private firm in Noida which has now been booked for endangering people’s lives and sealed.An estimated 626 samples have been tested so far and 1,852 people are under surveillance across Noida and Greater Noida, while another 291 have been quarantined at various isolation facilities in the district, local Health Department officials said.On the brighter side, six of the patients have so far recovered in Gautam Buddh Nagar and discharged from hospitals till Tuesday, leaving 32 active cases of coronavirus, they added.Meerut: The western Uttar Pradesh district is the second hotspot in the state, where the number of cases has crossed the 100 mark, with 19 people testing positive for the disease.Of the 17 samples tested on Monday, six were declared positive, officials said. Of the six, four are family members of a man who recently returned from Maharashtra. The first COVID-19 case was reported from here last Friday.MAHARASHTRAMumbai: After several cases of random people testing positive for COVID-19 emerged on Monday in Mumbai, the state health department declared Koliwada area of Worli and the Goregaon suburb as two hotspots.In Mumbai, the novel coronavirus has claimed eight lives and there are 167 positive cases.There are 230 coronavirus positive cases detected in Maharashtra so far. Of these, 10 lost their lives and 39 people have been discharged after recovery. There are 181 active cases of COVID-19 in the state.Pune: Forty-six cases were reported as on Tuesday. The first two positive cases in Maharashtra were reported from Pune on March 9.Pune Municipal Corporation’s chief health officer Dr Ramchandra Hankare said one COVID-19 patient died of multi-organ failure in a private hospital on Monday. Barring two people who are critical, rest of all the patients are stable and recuperating in the hospitals, he said.So far 3,500 people including those who have foreign travel history, their close contacts have been “home quarantined”.According to officials, 2,216 passengers are under surveillance. Of these, 1,403 have completed their 14-day incubation period and 813 are still under active surveillance.GUJARATAhmedabad: Of 73 coronavirus cases registered in Gujarat so far, the highest number of 23 cases has been detected in Ahmedabad district, mostly in Ahmedabad city.Ahmedabad city counts for three of six deaths in Gujarat. Of the five persons who have recovered so far, four are from Ahmedabad city.“Ahmedabad city has been declared as hotspot to prevent spread of the virus in a particular area after a positive case surfaces. Ideally, a three kilometre km area surrounding the residence of that patient is contained for 14 days. It’s like a total lockdown. No one can come inside or go outside except the health staff,” said Dr Prakash Vaghela, additional director, Public Health, Gujarat.KERALAKasaragod: Kasaragod is one of the worst affected districts in the country with the number of positive cases standing at 99, while over 7,725 people are under observation. A total of 163 people are in isolation wards.Contact with already infected persons and possible infection from foreign returnees are seen as the causes of virus spread.Pathanamthitta: Pathanamthitta may have reported lesser number of positive cases at five, but 7,254 people are under observation.Both these districts have not reported any death so far.

01-04-2020||New Delhi||Sonia Gandhi asks PM to give 21 days' wages in advance to MGNREGA workers||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Wednesday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking advance payment of 21 days' wages to MGNREGA workers across the country to help them tide over the present crisis due to coronavirus lockdown.In her letter to the prime minister, Gandhi said a large number of rural poor are without work and around 8 crore MGNREGA workers are devoid of an alternative source of income due to the countrywide lockdown, thus, they should be paid money in advance to tide over the current crisis."Given the urgency of providing income support to the rural poor, due to lost wages, the government may consider immediate advance payment of wages for 21 days to registered and active MGNREGA workers," she said.The Congress Parliamentary Party chairperson said the advance wages may be adjusted against the work to be done by the workers, once MGNREGA sites are opened up."I request you to take immediate action and extend support to nearly eight crore rural workers in the country," she said.Gandhi said since its inception, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has been a critical lifeline for the rural poor, particularly during periods of chronic economic distress.She noted that lakhs of agricultural workers have been left unemployed during the crucial harvesting season.Devoid of an alternative source of income, she said an increasingly large number of the rural poor are expected to demand work under MGNREGA.However, social distancing norms have rendered all works unfeasible during the lockdown, she said, adding that even when the MGNREGA works commence the workers would be paid after a month thereafter to get their wages. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-gandhi-asks-pm-to-give-21-days-wages-in-advance-to-mgnrega-workers-64152
01-04-2020||New Delhi||250 Indians stranded in Iran tested positive for COVID-19, Centre tells SC||The Centre on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that 250 Indian pilgrims stranded in Qom, Iran, have tested positive for coronavirus and have not been evacuated, while over 500 have already been brought back.The top court observed that it is thinking of asking the Indian embassy to constantly monitor the situation and be in touch with the stranded Indians in Iran.A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said it will pass the orders in favour of the petitioners and would ask the Indian embassy to take fresh tests and look into the possibility of bringing them back as and when possible.It observed that government is taking the matter seriously.At the outset, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Centre said that many of the Indians stranded in Iran have been brought back.Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for the petitioner, said that not all of those stranded have been brought back and around 250 people, who have tested positive are still there and are at the mercy of Iranian authorities.He said the court ask the Solicitor General to take instruction about bringing back 250 people, who have tested positive, still stranded in Iran.Mehta countered the arguments and said that at present all International flights have been cancelled and authorities are waiting for a decision of Ministry of External Affairs.“Our embassy at Iran is in touch with the 250 people stranded there. They will be brought back, whenever there is possibility,” he said, adding, that the petition has become infructuous.To this, the bench told Hegde that that those people, who are stranded in Iran are being taken care of and the matter should be left on government now.“You (petitioner) can raise this issue again when need arises,” the bench said.Hegde contended that many of Indian citizens who are still in Iran do not have symptoms and if they are asked to stay in hotels, where others with symptoms are being quarantined, they may develop it there.He said that 250 people in Iran don’t have money, medicines and other amenities and why can’t they be brought to a place like Leh?Mehta replied that many people who were earlier brought back and sent to Leh and other places have now developed symptoms.The bench said that it will issue an order in favour of their repatriation as and when the health situation of stranded Indians improves.Iran is one of the countries worst affected by the global pandemic, also called Covid-19, and has reported over 2,000 deaths so far due to coronavirus.Petitioner Mustafa MH, a resident of Union Territory of Ladakh, has said in his plea that some of his relatives had travelled to Iran along with a group of about 1,000 pilgrims in December last year. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/250-indians-stranded-in-iran-tested-positive-for-covid-19-centre-tells-sc-64148
01-04-2020||New Delhi||ISMA assures government availability of sugar amid coronavirus lockdown||Sugar Industry Body (ISMA) on Wednesday assured the government there is enough sugar with the sugar mills, therefore there will not be any problem of availability of this essential kitchen item in the country.The spread of COVID-19, and the lockdown had initially disrupted some movement of sugar due to lack of availability of trucks, but due to the intervention of Ministry of Food and Notifications from Home Ministry, sugar dispatches have picked up in the last 4-5 days, according to a statement issued by ISMA.However, Sugar companies are facing some problems in smooth supplies of ethanol, it also said.According to ISMA, as many as 457 sugar mills started crushing operations during 2019-20 season, 70 less than 527 mills operating last year.As on March 31, 271 mills had stopped functioning and only 186 sugar mills in are crushing on that date, most of them being in North India. In comparison, last year as on March 31, 240 mills were operating.As much as 232.74 lakh tons of sugar has been produced till yesterday as against 296.82 lakh tons produced last year, about 64.08 lakh tons less, said ISMA"ISMA has assured the Government that there is enough sugar with the sugar mills, and therefore, there will not be any problem of availability of this essential food item for the consumers", it saidWherever there is any availability of sugarcane, the sugar mills are making all efforts to ensure that the farmers do not face any problem, and sugar mills in those areas are operating, it addedDuring the initial a couple of days of the lockdown, there was concern about smooth availability of important inputs like lime, sulphur, bags, phosphoric acid etc.Availability of these inputs have since been assured by the Government and the suppliers therein and normal supplies have been restored, said ISMAHowever, the lime quarries/kilns were closed by the Government of Rajasthan."The matter was taken up by ISMA with the Rajasthan Government. After the intervention of the Food Ministry and UP Government, the Government of Rajasthan has allowed lime quarries/kilns to operate during this lockdown period, and there is smooth availability of all inputs now," it saidHowever, Sugar companies are facing some problems in smooth supplies of ethanol. This is mainly because of lower off take of petrol, because of which some of the depots of the OMCs are unable to take further supplies due to lack of storage space therein.Since individual contracts have been entered into between sugar companies and OMCs for ethanol supplies, which are depot wise across the country, the OMCs have been requested to reallocate the quantities to other depots where they have tankage/storage space, it said"The OMCs have responded very positively and very quickly to identify the depots where they are facing problems of storage capacities and depots where they can take further ethanol supplies, beyond the contracts.It is a matter of time by when the OMCs and the sugar companies would have mutually agreed to reallocate the ethanol quantities to other and newer depots. One expects that all the ethanol contracted for, will get fully supplied in the year, thanks to the full cooperation of the OMCs to relocate some of the supplies to other depots," ISMA said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isma-assures-government-availability-of-sugar-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-64146

He chose to approach the top court as his plea was not taken up for hearing immediately by the high court.On Wednesday, a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud sent him back to the high court.Extradited from Dubai, Michel was arrested by the ED on December 22, 2018, and he has been in judicial custody since January 5, 2019. The trial court denied him bail in both the matters. Now, his bail plea is pending before the high court where the CBI and the ED have contended that he should not be granted the relief as he has a nexus with influential people and can influence witnesses.On January 5 last year, he was sent to judicial custody in the ED case. He is also lodged in judicial custody in another case registered by the CBI in connection with the scam. He is one of the three alleged middlemen being probed by the ED and the CBI. The other two are Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa.He cited the Supreme Court's recent order directing all the states and union territories to constitute high-level committees to consider releasing on parole or interim bail prisoners and under-trials for offences attracting up to seven-year jail term to decongest jails in view of the pandemic.The accused also mentioned the Prime Minister's March 24 announcement declaring a nationwide 21-day lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19.Contending that his health condition was critical and incompatible with the current prison status, especially to cope with the risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection; he submitted that it could have a lethal effect on him as he was already suffering from serious pathologies.“The agedness and a pre-existing ill state of health will make the applicant's (Michel) body more susceptible to the said infection than any other ordinary prisoner with a normal health condition," his petition read."Further, the presence within prisons of subjects who are tested positive for Covid19 pose a threat to the applicant considering his existing health condition and age,” the petition submitted.Michel's health condition needed to be monitored and treated and he requires home-like environment where the risk of contagion is less and social distancing can be effectively practiced, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-sc-asks-agustawestland-scam-accused-christian-michel-to-move-delhi-hc-for-interim-bail-64145

01-04-2020||Pathanamthitta (Kerala)||India's oldest Covid-19 survivor a teetotaller and non-smoker who loves his rice gruel with tapioca chips||At 93 years of age, Thomas Abraham has simple wants--Pazhankanji, Kerala's own super food made of rice gruel, and tapioca or jackfruit snacks. And that's what he insisted on eating while confined in the isolation ward after becoming India's oldest COVID-19 survivor in what is being dubbed by the medical community as a "miracle cure".Thomas and his wife Mariyamma, 88, both have been fully cured after days of life-and-death battle against the deadly virus which they contracted from their son, daughter-in-law and grandson who returned from Italy last month. All three have also recovered fully and are now waiting for the return of the miracle couple home.Doctors say the couple will probably be discharged on Wednesday from the Kottayam Medical College Hospital where they were in critical condition for days. Coronavirus is known to be especially deadly for elderly people.The secret behind their recovery seems to be the healthy lifestyle they have been leading, said Rijo Moncy, their grandson half-jokingly. He said Thomas, a farmer in Ranni sub-division of Pathanamthitta district, is a very healthy person being a teetotaller and non-smoker. Even without going to the gym, he had a six-pack body."It's a miracle that they survived the pandemic and the doctors and the health officials have put in their all efforts to save them," said Rijo who works in Italy in the radiology field.He and his parents, who also have been living in Italy for years, praised the state government, which also has the distinction of having cured India's first three coronavirus cases earlier."We were planning to come to Kerala in August but advanced the journey as my grandfather insisted that we should visit him soon. However, now we feel that it was a blessing or else we would have been in Italy right now," Rijo told PTI.Italy is the hardest hit country in the world with more than 11,500 fatalities and over 1,01,700 infections, as per the latest reports."I used to live with my grandfather during my higher studies and we are really close. He insisted that we should visit him as soon as possible. He also said that they had a better chance of survival in Kerala rather than in Italy."The government there passed off the initial signs of coronavirus as seasonal common flu. But later it got out of their hands. The area where we are staying in Italy is not that affected," he added."We are sure that the good and efficient medical team in Kerala helped us to get cured from the pandemic. If we were in Italy, we might not have survived," he said.Asked about their favourite food, he said while his grandfather loves "Pazhankanji" made  of rice gruel, "Kappa" (tapioca) and "chakka" (jackfruit) snacks, his grandmother loved fish.Even while at the isolation ward, grandpa asked for his "Pazhankanji" and coconut chutney and "kappa" etc and these were provided to him, he said."They were waiting for us to come (from Italy) and fill the home with fun and laughter. But... Now, we are eagerly waiting for their homecoming. We were told they are likely to be discharged by Wednesday", he said.The family has already prepared fish curry, fish fry and rice and hoping the elderly couple would soon reach home.The couple have three children, seven grandchildren and 14 great grandchildren. Besides his parents and grandparents, Rijo's sister and brother-in-law and his father's elder brother were among those infected by the virus in the family."Grandparents had age related complications. But the nurses and the doctors of Kottayam Medical College considered them as their own family and took care of them. We are really thankful to the government, health minister and the chief minister for the care we got," Rijo said.Rijo's sister and brother-in-law, both nurses, had arrived from Italy eight months  ago.Along with the seven-member team of doctors who led the treatment, 40 medical staff including 25 nurses actively took part in various stages of treatment.The central district of Pathnamthitta has 7,486 people under observation, 19 in isolation wards and five positive cases in hospitals.

Thank you @narendramodi!#TogetherApart https://t.co/k52G4viwDs  "Whenever I get time, I practice Yoga Nidra once or twice a week. It furthers overall well-being, relaxes the mind, reduces stress and anxiety. You will find many videos of Yoga Nidra on the net. I'm sharing a video each in English and Hindi," he tweeted."This is wonderful! Thank you @narendramod! #TogetherApart," Ivanka said on Tuesday as she retweeted Modi's post.Ivanka accompanied her father and US President Donald Trump during his maiden visit to India in February. Trump was accompanied by First Lady Melania, daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and the top brass of his administration.Yoga has been spreading fast in the US for the last several years, but its pace accelerated after the declaration of International Yoga Day by the United Nations in 2015 and Prime Minister Modi taking a proactive step in its awareness.According to some estimate, some 36 million Americans practise yoga."Yoga helps to harmonise the mind and body. Even in our separateness, PM @narendramodi  guides on being together, being aware through yoga. @IvankaTrump #TogetherApart," India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu said in a tweet.In the wake of current coronavirus crisis, wherein more than 250 million Americans are forced to stay home, yoga is increasingly being used by the people.The Indian Embassy in the US, on Monday started a daily online yoga class. The emphasis of these classes are on using the yoga postures and breathing exercises to strengthen immune system, the embassy said in a tweet. The classes are streamed through the embassy's Facebook page.Congressman Tim Ryan on Tuesday said that for a long time, practising yoga and mindfulness have helped him take care of his mental health."In uncertain times like these, looking after ourselves and our loved ones is especially important," he said.Responding to a question during Mann ki Baat on Sunday on how he is keeping fit during the lockdown, Modi had said he would post the videos."But do remember, that I am not a fitness expert, I am also not a yoga teacher. I am merely a practitioner... some yoga asanas have greatly benefited me. It's possible that some of these tips might help you too during the lockdown," he said.A nationwide 21-day lockdown was enforced on March 24 to check the spread of coronavirus as social distancing is possibly the only way to prevent people from infecting the deadly virus.The death toll from the rapidly-spreading coronavirus pandemic has risen to 41,654 and over 850,580 people have been infected by the deadly virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.In India, the death toll due to COVID-19 went up to 32 and the number of cases rose 1,251 by Monday 9.30 pm, up from 1,024 cases and 27 deaths on Sunday evening, according to the Union Health Ministry.

01-04-2020||Sandeep Dikshit ||Covid: India, US to partner on developing Covid vaccine; Pompeo calls up Jaishankar||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 1US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo today called up his counterpart S Jaishankar to discuss prospects of a closer all-round Indo-US partnership in combating Covid.“Our close cooperation is imperative to combat the coronavirus, including strengthening global pharmaceutical and healthcare manufacturing and supply chains,’’ Pompeo told Jaishankar according to a US State Department readout. The two leaders also touched upon the burgeoning partnership in the Asia Pacific and other parts of the globe.Senior State Department official Alice Wells followed up Pompeo’s social media post by hoping that India and US would collaborate in developing a vaccine to end the Covid epidemic just like they had partnered for over 25 years to develop the rotavirus vaccine that is expected to save the lives of 80,000 children in the country every year.The two foreign ministers also dwelt on the need to keep open supply chains, especially for Covid-related medical equipment and medicines. Trade chiefs of G-20 countries during a videoconferencing session on Monday had also discussed this issue of countries wanting to preserve stocks of medicines and food for their citizens versus catering to the humanitarian needs of people in other countries.Several countries have criticised Russia for cutting down on grain exports and countries have been cajoled into lifting the ban on exports of all but critically required personal protection equipment.The conversation between Pompeo and Jaishankar are part of worldwide effort by world leaders to constantly keep in touch by video conferencing and phone conversations in order to facilitate problem solving on global finance and health collaboration issues.The South and Central Asia wing of the US State Department also appreciated the innovation by an Indian boy to avoid touching elevator buttons and stop spreading germs. The eighth class boy from Noida made a board of matchsticks at home and set it up in his apartment building so that the elevator can be used without directly touching the buttons.The first virus India-US collaboration program was part of a multinational, multi-institute effort on Rotavirus, the most common cause of severe diarrheal diseases in children worldwide. It began in 1990 and led to the production and supply of over three crore doses of Rotovac vaccine to children in India.Among those who contributed technical, manufacturing and financial resources toward vaccine development were Society for Applied Studies, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, AIIMS (India), IISc (India), Department of Biotechnology (India), Stanford University School of Medicine, Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH), Bharat Biotech, UK Department for International Development and the Research Council of Norway.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-india-us-to-partner-on-developing-covid-vaccine-pompeo-calls-up-jaishankar-64109

Within 24 hours, this Monday morning, the 43-year-old construction worker’s body was found lying in a canal by the paddy fields off Cherpu town.At Kechery, 28 km north of Shybu’s Venginissery village in central Kerala, daily wager KV Sanoj (38) chose to hang himself. That was last Friday. Four suicides were reported on weekend: SK Suresh and Biju Viswanathan of downstate Kollam district, KC Vijilal of north Malabar’s Kannur and B Vasu of Kaitharam near Kochi.All this for a common reason: non-availability of liquor. The state has all its beverages shops shut from March 25 following a nationwide lockdown against the coronavirus.While all the above deceased are in the 25-40 age bracket, a sexagenarian died due to acute withdrawal symptoms in Kollam. Murali Achari (62) of Mukhathala panchayat had turned violent at home for 48 hours before he suffered a cardiac arrest on Sunday.The same forenoon, Thoppil Noufal (38) of Kayamkulam in neighbouring Alappuzha district ended life by consuming shaving lotion. Around the same time, urban Changanassery in bordering Kottayam district saw a distressed 46-year-old atop a shopping complex threatening to jump.The police tried to calm down C Sasi standing on the building’s secondfloor, but to no avail: he is now in hospital with multiple fractures.The state administration had foreseen such a spectre. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who was the first in the country to announce a state’s closure (from March 24) to guard against the virus outbreak, had let liquor supply continue. To a cryptic question at that press meet in capital Thiruvananthapuram, he replied matter-of-factly: “No, liquor isn’t (yet) an essential commodity.”The “indispensability” of alcohol had by then triggered an animated debate among Malayalis. While supporters of political parties opposing the ruling Left highlighted the health hazard posed by long queues at beverages outlets amid the government’s sustained calls for social distancing, theChief Minister sought to defend the apparent contradiction by reiterating the “social issues” that entail a virtual prohibition.Chiefly, Vijayan hinted at the deaths that can follow when drunkards are suddenly deprived of alcohol, which is effectively a biological need. Two, there is high prospect of hooch (which is proving right: 9,700 litres of fermented wash seized in six days till March 29). Critics, ridiculing instances of how tipplers did maintain a metre’s gap at certain line-ups, wrote these off as a tactic to ensure non-stop tax flow to the exchequer.Now, with the Union home ministry’s order restricting human movement, theChief Minister suggests sale of liquor if the doctor prescribes a dose of it. The state’s medical and psychiatric associations have dismissed the idea.Simultaneously, the government is focusing on rehabilitation. “We’ve set up de-addiction centres in each taluk hospital. The treatment is free,” says Excise Minister TP Ramakrishnan.It is another matter Thrissur’s Shybu did visit a physician last week, but the ‘patient’ eventually found refuge in death alone.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-booze-8-commit-suicide-in-kerala-64002

The food shelters have been increased from over 800 to over 3,000 in the wake of Covid outbreak.Kejriwal said: “Out of the 97 cases in Delhi, 24 are a result of Markaz, 41 have a history of foreign travel, 22 are either the family members of travellers or victims of local transmission, and the remaining cases are being looked into. There is no community transmission in Delhi as of now.”Around March 12 and 13, people from across the nation gathered for a religious congregation in Delhi. Subsequently, many left for their homes, but some stayed back. “We are now identifying the people who had stayed put. Over 24 persons have tested positive.

The ones who are asymptomatic have been sent to quarantine centres,” he said.“During Navratri, all roads and temples wear a deserted look. Gurdwaras have been shut and people are refraining to go to Masjids. By holding a congregation at this time, they have committed a serious act. I request all the religious leaders and citizens not to organise any event,” the Delhi Chief Minister said.The Delhi government has written to the L-G for filing an FIR against the mosque administration.

Netizens questioned the need to sell 35 lakh pairs of sterile latex surgical gloves to Serbia when doctors in India were making video-posts addressed to the Prime Minister to highlight the shortage of personal protective equipment to frontline health workers. Russia has come under fire for the opposite reason — for limiting shipments of its grain abroad.India has also imposed restrictions such as on N-95 masks and banned the export of hydroxychloroquine, whose effects are unproven but has been touted by US President Donald Trump as a miracle cure for Covid.The sentiment at the virtual meeting of commerce ministers was to work together to deliver a non-discriminatory and stable trade and investment environment and to keep the markets open. “We will explore ways for logistics networks via air, sea and land freight to remain open,” they said in a joint statement released by Saudi Arabia.The World Bank and the EU spoke against new export restrictions on “critical medical supplies, food or other key products” since there is no global supply shortage.The EU itself has put exports of personal protective equipment on a case to case basis but the G-20 seemed inclined to offer a leeway to countries to prioritise their requirements.The US too wanted the restrictive actions to be temporary, transparent and appropriate.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/g-20-trade-chiefs-vow-to-keep-supply-chains-open-63999

Ketok has been charged under the IPC sections related to criminal conspiracy and murder and relevant provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The convoy of Khonsa MLA Tirong Aboh was ambushed by armed terrorists of the NSCN (IM) on May 21, 2019 near Pansum Thong village in Tirap district. The MLA was travelling to Khonsa from Dibrugarh. He was among 11 people killed in the ambush, while three others suffered injuries, officials said.The agency had charge-sheeted four accused — Luckin Mashangva, Jai Kishan Sharma, Yangte Josaham and Napong Jenpi — on January 27, 2020. In its probe, the NIA has found that NSCN (IM) members had allegedly conspired to kill the MLA and others due to his opposition to extortion activities of the terror group in Tirap, officials said.The agency has found that some NSCN (IM) members, led by self-styled “major general” Rockwang Tangkhul, alias Absolom Tangkhul, who has been absconding, formed a group to execute the killing. The group was financed by Jai Kishan Sharma, it said.

The RBI has made it clear that the moratorium will include principal and/or interest components, bullet repayments, EMIs and credit card dues. According to the brokerage firm Emkay, end-borrowers will not get a blanket deferment of payments. “The borrowers opting for deferment will either have to extend their tenure or increase the quantum of EMIs to compensate for the revenue loss,’’ it said. There were teething problems as in the absence of formal board meetings to stamp the RBI directive taken last week-end, many banks automatically sent messages to borrowers, credit card holders and mutual fund investors asking them to maintain sufficient balance on the date of deduction of EMI or credit card dues. The Agriculture Ministry has already announced that farmers will continue to get short-term loan of up to Rs 3 lakh at a subsidised interest rate of 7 per cent, and timely repayment will be incentivised with a three per cent reduction. A banker said such issues can be tackled in the coming days. What matters is that all sections of borrowers are eligible for across-the-board relief. Banks have already started sending customers messages on their registered mobile number about the deferment of EMI payments. But if customers opt for the three-month moratorium on loan repayments, then their EMI tenure or the amount will be appropriately increased with bankers reiterating that three-month deferment is not a loan write-off. Interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium period.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-absolute-clarity-on-emis-63853

The Ministry of Home Affairs, while giving the timeline of the turn of event, said it shared details of foreign and Indian Tablighi Jamaat workers in India with all states on March 21 after Covid-19 positive cases among these workers surfaced in Telangana. The MHA said as many as 2,100 foreigners visited India for Tablighi activities since January 1 this year and all of them first reported at its headquarters in Delhi’s Nizamuddin, which has apparently become a coronavirus hotspot.  The swift action was taken with a view to identify, isolate and quarantine those who might be Covid-19 positive, it said, adding that instructions were also issued by MHA to Chief Secretaries and Director Generals of Police (DGPs) of all states as well as Commissioner of Police, Delhi. The advisories were also reiterated by the Director Intelligence Bureau (DIB) to all State DGP on March 28 and 29.

Six deaths in Telangana and one in Kashmir involved people who had attended the Nizamuddin gathering.The government, meanwhile, said this was no time to find faults but acknowledged that lack of people’s cooperation in observing lockdown had led to a significant rise in Covid cases.The number of confirmed cases rose from 1,024 on Monday to 1,397 by Tuesday night, recording a rise of a whopping 373 cases—an increase of 36.44 per cent in a day.

Once 80 per cent of the population wears masks, the outbreak can be stopped immediately”. Quoting the World Health Organisation, the manual states “masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.”On ‘why wear a mask’, it says: “Covid-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person contact. Virus carrying droplets dry fast enough to form droplet nuclei and remain airborne eventually landing on different surfaces. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, has been detected in aerosols for up to three hours and on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to three days”.The manual says masks lower the chances of the virus entering the respiratory system through droplets still in the air from an infected person.The proposed guide is meant to provide a simple outline of best practices to make, use and reuse masks.The key criteria for proposed designs are ease of access to materials, easy of making at home, ease of use and reuse. Wearing of masks is especially recommended for people living in densely populated areas across India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-changes-tack-says-masks-can-stop-spread-63760

According to a new analysis from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) titled “The Covid-19 Shock to Developing Countries: Towards a ‘whatever it takes’ programme for the two-thirds of the world’s population being left behind”, commodity-rich exporting countries will face a $2 trillion to $3 trillion drop in investment from overseas over the next two years.The organisation said advanced economies and China have put together massive government packages which, according to the Group of 20 leading economies (G20), will extend a $5 trillion lifeline to their economies. “This represents an unprecedented response to the crisis, which will attenuate the extent of the shock physically, economically and psychologically,” it said.It said while full details of these stimulus packages were yet to be unpacked, an initial assessment by UNCTAD estimated that they would translate to a $1 trillion to $2 trillion injection of demand into the major G20 economies and two percentage point turnaround in global output.“Even so, the world economy will go into recession this year. This will spell serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of China and, possibly India,” the UNCTAD said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/un-except-india-china-world-to-slip-into-recession-63748

The Indian media has been questioning China’s continued efforts to exclude the island from an issue, like an epidemic that brooks no borders, so Beijing has voiced concerns over India media's stance.The Chinese embassy here took umbrage at media reporting in India on Taiwan’s aggressive stand on seeking inclusion in the World Health Organisation (WHO) meet from which it was thrown out after an Independence-minded President took office three years ago.Even before the epidemic broke out, Chung-kwang Tien, then Head of Taiwan’s Indian Centre, had made the case for Taiwan’s inclusion in a WHO conference on grounds that no country should be excluded from such a critical sector where his country had much to contribute.After it emerged that a December 31 advisory from the Taiwan Foreign Affairs Ministry had raised the flag on an unusual virus outbreak in Wuhan city, the Indian media has been questioning China’s continued efforts to exclude the island from an issue like an epidemic that brooks no borders.Taiwan had participated in the World Health Assembly as an observer under the name of “Chinese Taipei” for eight years from 2008 to 2016. While Taiwan seeks re-admittance, Beijing claims that was a special arrangement made at a time when the ruling party was keen on building bridges with the Chinese mainland.Dr Anamika, a Taiwan expert, says the WHO chief should extend a personal invite to Taiwan if its participation as an “observer non-member state’’ is problematic because of lack of agreement on whether it is a state or not.Sources seized on an angry statement from Chinese embassy media spokesperson Ji Rong to point out that even Beijing admits that politics had dictated the exclusion of Taiwan. Ji has said, “The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), since taking power (in Taiwan) in 2016, has been stubbornly adhering to Taiwan’s independence separatist stance, constantly challenging the One-China principle, thus undermining the political foundation for the region’s participation in the WHA.’’ This political change in government in Taiwan also changed the Chinese government’s stand on a health issue, sources pointed out.Ji went on to launch a broadside against the Indian media for making suggestions of politics dictating the sidelining of Taiwan. Ji made a solemn statement refuting some Indian media articles advocating so-called “Taiwan’s participation in the WHO.”The spokesperson pointed out that the articles violated the One-China principle and sent wrong signals to Indian people so the Chinese Embassy in India “expresses its strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition.’’The Chinese explanation is that the WHO is a specialised agency of the UN restricted to only sovereign states and Taiwan has no right to join WHO as a part of China.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-medias-reporting-on-taiwan-has-china-fuming-63745
