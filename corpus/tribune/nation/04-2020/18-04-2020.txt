But Kota Public Relations Deputy Director Hariom Gurjar said that the Uttar Pradesh government has assured them that more vehicles would be arranged if there is a shortfall.The Kota administration had prepared a list of students based on information received from coaching institutes and did not account for those studying in the city without enrolling in any institute, officials said.Additional Superintendent of Police Rajesh Mill, overseeing the exercise, said 100 buses with around 3,000 students left for Uttar Pradesh early in the morning.The process to send the remaining students whose names are in the list is underway, he added.Asked about the students who are not listed, he expressed the inability of the Kota administration in arranging more buses, saying, “It would not be possible at our level. The resources have to come from there (UP) and we can only cooperate and maintain social distancing while sending the students back home”.The students had started a social media campaign #SendUsBackHome on Tuesday, following which the Yogi government decided to bring them back.Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot praised the move, saying other state governments should follow suit.Officials said the buses have been sanitised and the students departing for their hometowns are being thermal screened before boarding them. Food packets, water bottles, masks are also being provided to the students.Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Saturday welcomed the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to bring back home students stranded in the coaching hub.However, Bihar minister Sanjay Kumar Jha is not impressed. He said the Uttar Pradesh government sending buses and Gehlot calling upon other states to follow suit are a “mockery” of the nationwide lockdown.Manish Kumar, a resident of Uttar Pradesh’s Maharajganj district and a medical aspirant, has been told that he may board a bus on Sunday.Following the outbreak of COVID-19, he says his family members are much worried and calls him at least 10 times to enquire his well being.Asked how he is arranging for his food, Manish said: “Currently we are dependent on local tiffin services. Initially, some children started cooking their own food, as they felt tense after the outbreak of COVID-19”.Tushar Shrestha, a friend of Manish, feels lucky to have returned to his home in Allahabad in February.“I returned to Allahabad in February itself, as my course got completed, and I managed to appear in some medical tests from Allahabad. I am in touch with some of my friends who are still in Kota,” he said.

It’s also being used by students, schools, colleges and other educational institutions for online classes.The use of Zoom app has put users’ data at risk, leading to mass violation of fundamental right to privacy, the letter petition written by Sanpreet Singh Ajmani and Aneesh Sharma said, urging the CJI to order a ban on its download and usage.Since the app was not safe it could be used to exploit young children and their videos could be misused for illegal purposes, they submitted.On April 12, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs had issued an advisory describing Zoom as unsafe app and prescribed steps to be followed by users to avoid any unpleasant experience.If the MHA concluded that the app was not safe it should have completely banned it, the letter petition said.Noting that business professionals were using Zoom for conducting meetings, the letter petition said the app was not safe and didn’t contain end-to-end encryption and users were getting suspicious mails.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/letter-petition-in-sc-seeks-ban-on-zoom-app-for-violation-of-right-to-privacy-72943
18-04-2020||New Delhi||Renewed focus by armed forces to insulate 15 lakh personnel from coronavirus||The outbreak of coronavirus at a key naval facility in Mumbai where 26 sailors have been infected is a wake-up call for stricter implementation of all laid down norms to insulate around 15 lakh armed forces personnel from the pandemic, military officials said on Saturday.All the three forces have already enforced a “no movement” policy under which almost all their bases have been put under total lockdown barring the wings handling key operational matters and strategic surveillance, they said.Official sources said the top brass in the defence ministry is reviewing the overall preparedness of the armed forces to deal with the pandemic.The Navy has strictly ordered all its bases to not allow any movement of its personnel and assets besides suspending all training activities after the first case of the infection was detected on April 7, a Navy official said.The Navy has suspended all transfers and fresh postings besides ordering people on leave to stay back home. Those onboard various ships and other platforms were told to extend their stay, he said.“We are now restricting movement of people from one building to another building inside the bases and commands. We are restricting any movement to and from the bases,” said another official.An Indian Air Force official said the Air Headquarters have issued specific guidelines to all the bases and establishments to insulate the personnel as well as platforms from the virus. The IAF has not reported any case of the infection so far.He said the aircraft sent on various evacuation missions to coronavirus-infected countries were too “quarantined” for 14 days besides being “disinfected” thoroughly.An Army official said a “rigorous protocol” is being followed at all the bases and establishments of the force to protect the 15lakh armymen from the virus.Listing the measures, he said all the establishments are operating with skeleton staff and people coming back from leave or emergency out-station assignments are being made to stay “separately” for at least couple of weeks.“We are even extending distance between the beds in barracks. It is an invisible war we are fighting,” the official said.About frontline bases along borders with Pakistan and China, the official said stricter norms are being followed to insulate them and that chances of the virus travelling to the areas were minimum.The official said movement of people in 62 cantonments have also been strictly restricted as part of precautionary measures.All the infected sailors of the Navy were serving at the INS Angre in Mumbai, a shore-based logistics and support establishment, and they are currently undergoing treatment at a Navy hospital.The Navy has launched a large-scale contact tracing operation to track people who may have come in contact with the sailors. Almost all the residents of the building inside INS Angre are being tested, the sources said.The Western Naval Command is considered a strategic establishment as it takes care of India’s maritime interests in the Arabian Sea as well as parts of the Indian Ocean. The Naval dockyard in Mumbai is only few hundred metres away from INS Angre.The outbreak of the coronavirus cases in Western Naval Command comes at a time when a number of navies globally are grappling with the pandemic.Over 660 sailors on board the USS Theodore Roosevelt, an aircraft carrier of the US Navy, reported coronavirus infection. A third of the nearly 2,000 sailors onboard French Navy’s aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle and its support ships are also infected with the virus.The Indian Army on Thursday directed all its military establishments, cantonments, formation headquarters and field units to totally restrict movement of forces till April 19 in view of the government’s fresh lockdown related guidelines.The order also mentioned that offices in Army headquarters, command headquarters and formation headquarters would start functioning with 50 per cent manpower from April 19 to May 3.It said all training activities and temporary duties will remain suspended till May 3, adding directions on actions to be taken post the lockdown period will be issued on receipt of fresh orders from the government.

In a damning indictment of the official, it said procedural fairness was at “the low end of the spectrum” while terming his dismissal of the editor’s testimony as unreasonable.The Canadian media has highlighted the case in an obvious effort to hit back at the Indian government which has accused Ottawa of being soft on Khalistani separatists settled there. Canadian Prime Minister’s week-long visit to India in 2018 turned out to be lonely sojourn as he was given a cold shoulder by South Block for his government’s perceived soft corner for the separatists.The media in Canada has led with the allegation that this journalist, identified in Canadian court documents only as “AB”, was being used to target Canadian politicians in a covert operation. This is despite the fact that the court has pulled up Canadian officials for this unfounded allegation and given AB another chance to apply for PR status. The story has been subsequently picked up by Pakistani newspapers as well.It all started five years back when the Canadian secret service prepared an assessment report on “AB” after which the Canadian Border Security Agency (CBSA) concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe his involvement in espionage against Canada. In a written response, AB vehemently denied any association with the Intelligence Bureau and RAW and said he had interacted with their officers to gather news.The Canadian secret service had also alleged that RAW had tasked him to meet officials from Belgium and Canada besides identifying Caucasian politicians to provide financial assistance and propaganda material. It was also alleged that he met IB and RAW handlers outside Canada at least once every two months. AB will now get another opportunity to clear his name.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/accused-of-raw-ib-links-indian-scribe-in-canada-gets-another-chance-to-clear-his-name-72939
18-04-2020||Satya Prakash||COVID: Plea in SC challenges Maharashtra, Home Ministry order to firms to pay full salaries to workers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 18Amid reports of layoffs and salary cuts in various industries, a petition in the Supreme Court has challenged the orders issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the Maharashtra Government asking companies to pay full salaries to workers during COVID19 lockdown.Instead of issuing orders to companies to pay full salaries during COVI-19 lockdown, the government should have considered using Rs 350 crore unclaimed Provident Fund Deposits to offer financial support to workers during this unprecedented crisis, it suggested.Filed by Mumbai-based textile company Nagreeka Exports Ltd, the petition challenged the MHA's March 29 and Maharashtra Government's March 31 orders mandating companies to pay full salaries to their staff and workers for the lockdown period. The petitioner said it has paid full salaries and wages to all its employees and workers till month of March, 2020.Stating that it had to incur Rs 1.5 crore loss due to the lockdown, the petitioner contended that if companies were forced to pay full salaries, it would have far reaching consequences.The petitioner states it had to disburse full salaries to all its employees on its payroll, which amounts to approximately Rs.1.75 crores. Due to extension of lockdown, its losses will be multiplied and if it were to comply with the government orders, its business will become unsustainable, it contended.Maintaining that the government orders will have "far reaching consequences affecting the livelihood of more people”, the petitioner requested the top court to allow it to pay 50 per cent of basic pay plus DA to its employees and workers (without PF and ESIC contributions).Terming the MHA and Maharashtra Government's orders as arbitrary, the petitioner contended that the two orders violated its fundamental right to rights to practice any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.The Disaster Management Act -- under which these notifications for payment of salaries were issued -- didn't provide for continued payment of wages by employers to their employees and workers during any disaster, the petitioner said, adding, the orders were beyond the scope of the Act.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-plea-in-sc-challenges-maharashtra-home-ministry-order-to-firms-to-pay-full-salaries-to-workers-72938
18-04-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body accused of fudging coronavirus numbers||The opposition BJP has accused the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation of reducing the number of tests carried out on suspected carriers of the coronavirus in order to lower number of cases in the city.”The recent norms of testing are not in line with the ICMR guidelines and will leave us with a false reduction in numbers and further spread of virus as we will not be testing all direct contacts within the stipulated time,” Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Mumbai Ameet Satam said in a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.The BMC had earlier this week announced that it would halt testing of even direct contacts of people who test positive for the coronavirus. The civic body has suggested that they be quarantined at home, or if it was not feasible, at quarantine centres. Tests would beconducted on them between the fifth and the 14th day of their quarantine, according to the guidelines issued by Mumbai Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi.Justifying his decision, Pardeshi said a large number of suspected cases test negative initially but were found to be positive following subsequent tests. He added that the new strategy would help conserve the limited amount of testing kits available with the civic body.In order to reduce pressure on hospitals, the civic body decided to shift asymptomatic positive patients to Corona Care Centres. According to data put out by the civic body, most of the patients who have tested positive for the virus are asymptomatic.The civic body has also asked people who develop symptoms to report to fever clinics being set up in areas where clusters of COVID-19 cases have been reported.Mumbai has so far reported around 2,200 cases of people testing positive for the COVID-19 virus, accounting for most of the cases in Maharashtra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-civic-body-accused-of-fudging-coronavirus-numbers-72937

Presently, as per DGCA’s advisory, airlines have to refund money to customers who had booked tickets between March 25 to April 14, for travel between April 15 and May 3, instead of credit shell. A statement from the EaseMyTrip claimed that it is the only company who has been refunding money to the customers’ bank account even if airlines are providing amounts in EMT’s virtual wallet only.Speaking on the current situation, Nishant Pitti, Co-founder and CEO, EaseMyTrip, said, “As a responsible corporate we are very much concerned to take this necessary step to provide refund in the form of cash to the customers in the hour of need. We have been receiving money on our virtual wallet from airlines which is of no use for the time being. But still we are paying money to customers’ bank account from our own expense.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-travel-aggregators-start-refund-to-passengers-for-suspended-flights-72933

Local peasant markets and fairs must open again urgently to supply cities and prevent hunger, he said." There should be no import dependence of Agri goods and incentives should be given to Indian farmers to grow ourselves. Dairy farmers should also be supported by procurement of milk from their village by the dairy cooperative," added Tikait.  BKU leaders said farmers have suffered heavy loss due to heavy hailstorm and rains and the government should exempt electricity and water charges and interest on bank loans for a year and make reinvestment in public policies for health, education, labour and rural areas.Accusing the government of not announcing any relief measures for farmers during the pandemic, they said the government must ensure farmers and labourers access to healthy, culturally appropriate food and prevent shortages. "It must act now to end the monopoly of transnational agribusiness over essential commodities. "In this fight against hunger, there is an urgent need to invest in peasant agriculture and support local peasant markets, while complying with the necessary health measures. "Now is the time to uphold the food sovereignty of our communities and to guarantee the rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas. It is now essential to promote Public Policies that benefit the majority of the population, that prioritise care for the most vulnerable sectors, such as rural workers, women, migrants and the working class of the cities", said BKU leaders.  "This crisis shows us once again the need to enact a profound change in the capitalist system. It is a system that is untenable and incompatible with nature and life. It is time to introduce structural transformations in the agri-food systems, and not just push for more aid programs."Our task as farmers is to feed the people, and we want to continue doing so. We understand that the production of healthy food cannot cease and that it is the first line of defence against COVID-19. However, this requires providing safe and dignified living conditions for peasants, during and after the crisis", said the BKU.States must ensure the public procurement of food produced by small-scale farmers. We must adopt principles of agroecology and feed our communities nutritious, healthy food to improve our immunity, something that supermarkets and fast food chains cannot do, it added.  In the context of the crisis, it is urgent to ensure access to free testing and full treatment, in urban and rural areas, free of discrimination, with a firm commitment in defence of life. We denounce all attempts to take advantage of this crisis to privatise services or to generate a profit.It is essential to guarantee Peasant Rights, as stated in the UN Declaration adopted in 2018. This crisis is also an opportunity to spread seeds of change. We must prepare the land for a different model of society and agri-food systems, according to the BKU.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bku-demands-rs-1-5-lakh-crore-package-procurement-points-at-village-level-72920

He advocated aggressive testing as the main weapon.Since the announcement of Janata Curfew on March 22, followed by a 21-day lockdown from March 24, Congress leaders have routinely engaged on COVID-related issues with Sonia Gandhi writing three letters to the PM on various issues arising from the pandemic.Rahul Gandhi has been regularly tweeting.AICC General Secretary Priyanka Vadra has written twice to the UP Chief Minister seeking welfare of migrants and the vulnerable.With political activity grounded due to lockdown, the Congress believes it needs to get aggressive when raising people’s concerns around COVID shutdown.CMs of Congress-ruled states have addressed press meets to flag their levels of combat with the virus while raising gaps in financial matters which they say are hampering preparedness.With PM Narendra Modi directly engaging the people through his repeat addresses to the nation, the Congress thinks it must stay in circulation and people’s minds at this critical time when the PM obviously has a clear edge having led the people to do what he wanted—from beating utensils and lighting diyas to staying home.The consultative group primarily seeks to sustain the Congress media outreach on COVID.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/manmohan-singh-led-congress-consultative-group-to-discuss-matters-of-concern-daily-72918

But they have been stuck due to the ongoing lockdown,” the official said, adding that the force on April 7 asked them to stay wherever they were till the lockdown.“We have to contain the spread of this deadly coronavirus and we cannot afford to have our men fall sick because of it as this may impact their border guarding duty which is now at its peak,” he said.The BSF is extending sanitisation facilities and makes the farmers aware of the Covid-19 protocol.

Twenty-two of these cost some Rs 13,951 crore (approximately $2.1 billion then). The Indian Air Force has ordered a Court of Inquiry (CoI). It is a serious issue for such a sophisticated copter that will comprise the lead in ground attack. The Boeing will also be invited to inspect the copter. Each of these copters cost Rs 630 crore.The induction of the Apache is a “technological leap”. The Apache can operate at 20,000 feet and is most likely to be dual tasked — one with the conventional tank formations of the western command, the other, if need be, can be used to target enemy at high altitudes. The existing attack helicopters can fly only up to 14,000 feet. The height occupied by Pakistan army during Kargil war (May-July 1999) was in excess of 16,000 feet. By 2020, the IAF will operate a fleet of 22 Apaches which were ordered by the Ministry of Defence in 2015.Separately, New Delhi had cleared the acquisition of an additional six Apaches for the Army at cost of $ 930 million.

However, allegations and speculations are that after toppling the Kamal Nath government with the help of 22 of his men, and that too right amid the corona crisis, the main reason why there is still no council of ministers to assist Chouhan is because the saffron party is not clear about who to accommodate and who to leave out.Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh continues to see a serious surge in coronavirus cases, especially in Indore and Bhopal, emerging quite near the top in the dubious list of Covid-19 infection and deaths. While BJP leaders are blaming Kamal Nath for "not doing anything on the front" while he was trying to save his government, the former Congress CM has accused PM Narendra Modi of delaying the nationwide lockdown only to topple him.A state not having a health minister at such a time is unheard of. There were speculations that some ministers could be appointed around April 15 but it seems the BJP has not been able to settle the dynamics of the Cabinet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/battling-covid-mp-is-without-cabinet-72813

We will be testing that now,” the Indian Council of Medical Research states.“The therapy has however not been tested in a clinical trial mode. It has only been tested in some observational studies where it has helped reduce oxygen dependence of serious Covid patients thereby helping them breathe better on their own,” ICMR’s Chief Epidemiologist R Gangakhedkar said.The ICMR has now invited participation in a randomised controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma to limit Covid-associated complications and another study in which the ICMR will study the efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange in virus patients.The therapy involves isolation of antibody rich plasma from the blood of fully cured Covid-19 patients and administration of this plasma to critical and severely ill patients on ventilator support.At this moment, the ICMR does not recommend convalescent plasma therapy as a treatment option outside of clinical trials. Only severely ill Covid patients would be part of the trial.“The ICMR is inviting a letter of intent from institutions with the equipment and infrastructure available to participate in a clinical trial to study the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma in Covid-19 patients, subsequent to necessary approvals and clearances,” a letter issued by the council says inviting partners for a controlled study on critically ill patients.The ICMR has so far shared study protocols with Kerala and Delhi government which are now awaiting the nod of the Drug Controller General of India to carry out the critical clinical trial.In Kerala, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute of Medical Sciences, under the state’s science and technology department, has got the plasma therapy protocols from the ICMR but is awaiting the apex drug controller’s nod for the trial.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/icmr-launches-clinical-trials-to-test-efficacy-of-plasma-therapy-72812
