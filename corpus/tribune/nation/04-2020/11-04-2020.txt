Only 2 per cent cases tested positive. Based on the samples collected, we can say that the infection rate is not high although it is dynamic". The transmission scenarios in the WHO situation report are self-reported by the member states.The WHO has defined four transmission scenarios for COVID-19 -- no confirmed cases, sporadic cases, clusters of cases, and community transmission – that are being reported.Community transmission refers to a large outbreak of local transmission. – IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-community-transmission-of-coronavirus-in-india-says-who-69784

He died of cancer on April 9.Colonel Bal’s parents -- Lt Col KS Bal (retd) and mother Ramninder Kaur – started off on April 10 on a 2,100 km road trip that will culminate in Bengaluru, possibly on Saturday night.“The cremation of Bal, 39, has been held up,” a Para-SF mate of Col Bal told The Tribune.Aarti, the wife of the colonel, awaits the elderly couple for the last rites of her husband. The colonel leaves behind two sons – aged 8 and 4.With no commercial flights or trains operating, the family was given the option of transporting the colonel’s body on a military aircraft to Delhi. However, the family wanted the cremation in Bengaluru, Army officials said.The option was explored if the elderly couple could be flown in on a military plane to Bengaluru. Thanks to confusion at several levels in the Ministry of Defence and the military establishment, the senior Bals could not be accommodated on a military plane which was anyway scheduled between Palam (New Delhi) and Bengaluru on April 10.Sources said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, acting on a request from the office of the Chief of Defence Staff, permitted the flight for the senior Bals on board a C-17 transport plane of the IAF on April 10.Since the C-17 flight was at the requisition of the MHA, someone in the military establishment thought it was better to take sanction from the MHA. The MHA telephonically informed that it had ‘no problem’ if the Bals were flown, sources said.The fact that a retired military man was going for the ‘last darshan’ of his dead son – a gallantry-award-winning soldier -- did not cut through the red tape. The military establishment insisted on a written sanction from the MHA. In turn, the MHA told officials coordinating the flight that a request for such a sanction need not even come to it as there is no rule for the MHA to allow or deny permission for military planes or passengers on board such planes.Sources in the know of things said the telephonic nod from the MHA should have been noted and orders passed accordingly; these are unusual times and needed an out-of-the-box solution. Also, the Bal family was ready to pay for the flight. In places like Leh, civilians are often ferried to Chandigarh on military planes during winter months as there are no flights. Also, since the Defence Minister is heading the Group of Ministers on Covid, permission from him was more than enough.An official said a matter which should have ended at the table of the Joint Secretary (Air) in the MoD has turned into a blame game. Retired veterans are blaming the babus in the MoD and also, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), without realizing that the fault was at multiple levels, including within the military.Meanwhile, on the night intervening April 9 and April 10 as the MoD, MHA and military were deciding on the rule book, long-time mates of Colonel Bal from the tightly-knit community of Para-SF collected Rs 22 lakh and chartered a helicopter that could pick up the elderly couple from an airport between Delhi and Bengaluru. That, however, did not materialise and the Bals are now on the road journey.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/red-tape-makes-deceased-colonels-parents-miss-military-plane-to-bengaluru-69746
11-04-2020||New Delhi||DST funded startup develops kits for testing asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, vaccine production||The latest in the line of DST-funded startups is the Seagull BioSolutions, which is working on new biological technologies, to develop Active Virosome (AV)-Vaccine and Immunodiagnostic kits for COVID-19 emergency. The government has invited for proposals from Indian companies and enterprises for supporting technologically innovative solutions towards fighting COVID-19. According to the officials, as many as 140 companies, have submitted their proposals till date. Many of these are from startups offering innovative solutions covering the gamut of areas.Active Virosome Technology (AVT) developed by Seagull Bio is useful for the production of vaccines and immunotherapeutic agents, they said.  The company anticipates that the unique features of AVs will enable the starting Phase I trials, by the end of 18-20 months, and Immunodiagnostic kits to be ready for the field trials by the end of August, 2020, and approved in 10-11 months. The AV vaccine is expected to take a longer time.However, given the emergency situation, SBPL aims to complete the proof of concept in 80 days and  complete preclinical development and start Phase I trial by the end of 18-20 months, said officials. The AVT platform is useful for producing novel, non-hazardous and economical Active Virosome agents expressing desired antigens from the target pathogen.These will be used to develop a novel vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 infection and also immunodiagnostic ELISA kits for COVID-19.“Accurate diagnostics, breaking the chain of transmission, therapy and preventive measures including safe and effective vaccines are the foundational pillars of addressing the challenges of COVID-19. Of these, developing vaccines has the longest timeline and so it is essential to fast track that activity NOW,” said, secretary DST, Professor Ashutosh Sharma.Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic kits, which are currently available in India are rapid. They enable detection of active COVID-19 infection, but cannot identify asymptomatic infections, or those people, who were exposed to or infected with COVID-19 in the past and did not suffer from the disease or have recovered from COVID-19 disease and may still be spreading the virus. In contrast, Immunodiagnostic kits help in detection of the antibodies to COVID-19, which can identify these infections also.Therefore, SBPL has initiated efforts to produce Immunodiagnostic kits for COVID-19. These tests will enable healthcare researchers to monitor the spread of COVID-19 more accurately. Officials say the Indian industry and the start-up ecosystem have responded enthusiastically to the invitation by the Technology Development Board (TDB), a statutory body of the DST, for proposals from Indian companies and enterprises for supporting technologically innovative solutions towards fighting COVID-19.TDB provides financial support to Indian companies for the commercialisation of indigenous technology or adaptation of imported technology and had invited proposals on March 20, 2020, to strengthen the nation’s core capacities in fighting COVID-19. It covered key areas like surveillance, laboratory support, infection prevention and control, logistics, risk communication, and, in particular, to strengthen the capabilities in terms of isolation and management of critically ill patients for containing and preventing the spread of the pandemic."The impact of the call was widespread, and within the first week, more than 300 companies marked their presence by registering on TDB Portal. In addition, 140 companies have submitted their proposals to date. Many of these are from Startups offering innovative solutions covering the gamut of areas", officials add.Meanwhile, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) an Institution of National Importance under the DST,  has obtained a go-ahead for taking a bold step to provide innovative treatment to patients suffering from COVID-19 disease.  Technically called “convalescent-plasma therapy”, the treatment aims at using the immune power gained by a recovered person to treat a sick person.Indian council for medical research (ICMR) the top authorising body in India has given approval to the SCTIMST for carrying out the novel treatment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dst-funded-startup-develops-kits-for-testing-asymptomatic-covid-19-infections-vaccine-production-69743

People have been trying to purchase hurrack by any means possible,” said Mac Vaz, founder-president of Cashew Distillers and Bottlers’ Association.Hundreds of wine shops in the coastal state were shut, following the nationwide lockdown, which was imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus.Hurrack, which is made from cashew apple juice, is not commercially sold, but is bottled at backyard distilleries spread across Goan villages.A one litre bottle of hurrack costs around Rs 100, and it is important to note that distillers have not hiked the price of this summer brew despite the rise in demand, Vaz said.Vikas Prabhu, a cashew grower based in Nirancal near Ponda, said most of the hurrack is purchased for home consumption and the drink does not have a long shelf-life.“People wait for the hurrack season, but the demand for the traditional drink has gone up as wine shops are closed,” he said, adding that the brew is a strong substitute for any good quality drink and is affordable.The rise in demand is helping cashew growers, who are also involved in distilling the cashew apple juice at their farms, Prabhu said.Meanwhile, president of All Goa Liquor Traders’ Association Dattaprasad Naik said they will keep wine shops shut, till the government asks them to do so.“We support the government in its fight against coronavirus. Wine shops are also one of the most vulnerable places where deadly virus can spread, as people from different sections of the society turn up here,” he said.

Spitting in public places could enhance the spread of the COVID-19 virus,” the ministry said in a letter to chief secretaries of all states and union territories.In view of the increasing danger of the coronavirus pandemic, the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has also appealed to people to refrain from consuming smokeless tobacco products and spitting at public places.The letter stated that state and Union Territory governments have necessary authority under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act and under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code 1860 and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPc) to deal with COVID-19.“In this background, it is requested that necessary preventive measures may be taken under the appropriate law to prohibit the use and spitting of chewing smokeless tobacco products in public,” the letter stated.Few states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Haryana, Nagaland and Assam have already issued orders on the ban of use of smokeless tobacco products and spitting at public places during the COVID-19 epidemic. The death toll due to the novel coronavirus rose to 239 and the number of cases climbed to 7,447 in the country on Saturday, according to the Union Health Ministry.However, a PTI tally of figures reported by various states as on Friday showed at least 7,510 cases and 251 deaths.There has been a lag in the Union Health Ministry figures, compared to the number of cases announced by different states, which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states.

11-04-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus: Centre considering states'  request to extend lockdown by two more weeks||The central government was considering states governments' request to extend lockdown by two more weeks, government officials said on Saturday.The development came after a four-hour meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held through a video-conference with chief ministers.The interaction with CMs was the second such engagement since March 25 lockdown announced by the Centre.Modi said even while announcing the lockdown on March 24, he mentioned "Jaan hai to Jahan Hai" (if there is life, world will be there).At the very beginning, the prime minister said it was imperative to follow lockdown and social distancing protocol to save lives.“Majority of citizens have understood and discharged their responsibility by staying at home. By following this Mantra all of us are making efforts to save lives,” Modi said.“Now for a bright, prosperous and healthy future for India it is necessary to keep in mind both aspects, Life and Universe. Every citizen by discharging responsibility in adhering to this and following the directions of government and authorities will strengthen the country's fight against Corona Virus,” he said.The initial visuals of the meeting showed Modi wearing a white mask during the interaction which was among others attended by chief ministers -- Amarinder Singh (Punjab), Mamata Banerjee (West Bengal), Uddhav Thackeray (Maharashtra), Yogi Adityanath (Uttar Pradesh), Manohar Lal (Haryana),  K Chandrashekhar Rao (Telangana) and Nitish Kumar (Bihar).   Punjab and Odisha have already announced extending the lockdown beyond April 14 when the current spell of 21-day shutdown across the country ends on Tuesday.'Interference'Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy, in a separate video conference, said in the meeting it was mentioned that construction activities could be given relaxation by identifying these in three zones--- Green, Orange and Red. Centre would work out the finer points, he said. Addressing the conference organised by AICC, he said West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee raised the issue of "interference by the Governor in her Government's work”.On his part, the Puducherry chief minister said had he got the opportunity to speak he too would have complained about Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi, who he said behaved similarly in regard to working of his government. He also dismissed reports that during her interaction with state party chiefs on Friday, Congress president Sonia Gandhi credited Rahul Gandhi for containment work done in Bhilwara district of Rajasthan."My PCC Chief who was a participant said no such statement was made," he said, accusing the BJP of cooking it up.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-centre-considering-states-request-to-extend-lockdown-by-two-more-weeks-69721

11-04-2020||New Delhi||In India, more youth getting affected by Covid, 40% cases in 20-40 age group||Despite India reporting over 205 COVID-19 deaths in last one month, the country's death rate of about 3 per cent is lower than the global rate, and also much lower than several European countries like the UK, Italy and Spain, according to the analysis of official data.India had reported its first COVID-19 death from Karnataka on March 10. Suggesting that a relatively young Indian population may be one of the reasons for the low mortality rate due to the pandemic, experts have attributed the high number of fatalities in countries like Italy and Spain to their elderly population which are more susceptible to developing complications after contracting the infection.According to the data shared by the Union health ministry earlier this week, about 63 per cent deaths have been reported among people aged 60 and above, 30 per cent among people between 40 to 60 years and seven per cent among people below 40 years.India so far has reported over 7,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus with a death toll of 239, making it 3.04 per cent death rate ---percentage of deaths with respect to the total number of confirmed cases.As per the US official figures, that country has reported 4,27,460 COVID-19 cases with 14,696 deaths, amounting to a death rate of 3.4 per cent. However, according to John Hopkins University and Medicine, 4,66,299 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the US with 16,686 deaths (death rate of 3.57 per cent).However, death rate is high in Europe. As per official figures from European countries, Spain has death rate of 9.73 per cent (1,57,022 COVID-19 cases and 15,843 deaths) and Italy having a death rate of 12.72 per cent(143,626 cases and 18,279 deaths). The UK has reported a death rate of over 12 per cent (65,077 cases and 7,978 deaths). All much higher than India.Only Germany seems to be able to contain the spread of the fast-spreading virus effectively with 1,13,525 confirmed cases and 2,373 deaths reported so far, recording about a 2.09 per cent death rate.India's death rate of COVID-19 is also lower than the global death rate of 5.98 per cent with a total of 1,610,055 cases and 96,365 deaths worldwide, according to data and statistics website worldometer.Dr Ravi Shekhar Jha, Senior Consultant and Head of the Department, Pulmonology, Fortis Escorts Faridabad, said in Italy, Spain and the US, "older population has been affected more compared to India where the fatalities have been less, perhaps because our population is fairly young".Jha also attributed an early and strict lockdown in India as one of the reasons that may have helped in containing the COVID-19 cases.He, however, noted that in India, the COVID-19 mortality rates differed from region to region e.g about 10 per cent in Indore to about 1 per cent in Haryana.Jha lauded Germany for being able to keep the death rate from coronavirus very low, because of its "excellent healthcare system".Dr Rommel Tickoo, associate Director, internal medicine, Max healthcare, agreed with Jha, saying Germany has been able to keep the fatalities on lower side with their good healthcare system."Two reasons can be attributed to less deaths in India--- firstly, the high-risk group of people aged 60 and above being affected less compared to in Europe and the US, and secondly, less severity of the virus in India," he told PTI. "In India, the 20-40 age group account for over 40 per cent of the cases and above 60 age group about 19 per cent. So, in India the younger population is getting affected more, and hence, perhaps the less number of deaths," he said.Earlier this week, the health ministry had said people aged below 40 years account for 47 per cent of the total confirmed cases, those between 40 and 60 for 34 per cent, and those aged 60 years and above account for 19 per cent.Dr Rajesh Chawla, a pulmonologist at Apollo Hospital, also feels India having a relatively younger population compared to the Europe could be a reason for less fatalities in the country."Also, the 18-60 is an active age group compared to people who are 60 years and older, many of whom have comorbid conditions. Italy has a large geriatric population," he said while elaborating on the reasons why the virus could impact the older population more.Comorbidity refers to the existence of multiple disorders in the same person.

MoD spokesperson Bharat Bhushan Babu, on being pointed at how the defence pensions could be capped, said: “The ministry is in touch with the Finance Ministry. No problem with regards to payment of pensions is envisaged at this stage”. Officials point out that the pensions will have to be paid as per actuals. This cap on spending only 20 per cent in the first quarter cannot work. A sum of Rs 1,33,819 crore has been earmarked for pensions.But in case of the cap of defence services --- that is used for salaries, day-to-day fuel, training expenses, this cap can be managed as all training and travel has been put on hold due to the Covid.The cap in case of the capital spend will be insignificant as matters are expected to be ironed out once the lockdown lifts. This year a sum of Rs 1,13,626 crore has been set aside for capital allocation used for purchase of new aircraft, weapons warships, military hardware like UAV’s and guns.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/budget-cap-wont-hit-pensions-mod-69574

11-04-2020||Vibha Sharma---||Lockdown spin-off: Receding pollution brings a major relief||Tribune News Service New Delhi, April 10 The deadly and economy-dilapidating corona lockdown has also had some positive, rather pleasant spin-offs as well. While a couple of days back, people in Jalandhar woke to the breathtaking view of snow-clad Dhauladhar range in far-off Himachal because of low air pollution in the two states, here in a pollution hotspot of Delhi people are breathing a lot easier because of better than never before air quality. Air pollution levels have dipped remarkably across the country, including places where earlier people were gasping for breath. There is no proof on numbers, but expectedly and logically, low pollution levels and good air quality can be helping save lives across the world with many environmentalists now suggesting a limited lock-down every year to help the nature recover. While a link between pollution and death or serious illness from coronavirus was suspected, a recent Harvard analysis has also shown a “large overlap” between deaths from Covid-19 and long-term exposure to fine particulate matter, the more deadly PM 2.5 variety. According to this study, a person exposed to high levels of fine PM is 15% more likely to die from coronavirus than someone to lower levels. The results hold additional value for a country like India where exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollution is said to have contributed to over 1.2 million deaths in 2017. A study titled State of Global Air 2019, released around the same time last year, said that average life of a South Asian child growing in current high levels of air pollution will be shortened by two years and six months, while the global life expectancy loss is 20 months. From smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a major threat not just to health but also climate. According to the World Health Organisation, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-spin-off-receding-pollution-brings-a-major-relief-69561

Justice Michael Briggs of the insolvency division of the High Court granted relief to Mallya, ruling that he should be given time till his petitions to the Supreme Court of India and his settlement proposal before the Karnataka High Court be determined, allowing him time to repay his debts to the banks in full. Chief Insolvency and Company Court judge Briggs, in his verdict delivered Thursday, said there is no obvious advantage to the banks to pursue this class action at this point in time. “This bankruptcy petition is by any measure extraordinary. The banks are pressing for a bankruptcy order at a time when there are extant proceedings in India,” read the judgment. “In my judgment the banks are secured, at least in part… The hearing of the petition should be adjourned for the purpose of amendment and for time to pay the debts in full,” it noted. A consortium of Indian public sector banks led by the State Bank of India had sought a bankruptcy order against Mallya as part of efforts to recoup around GBP 1.145 billion of unpaid loans from Mallya. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mallya-gets-bankruptcy-reprieve-from-uk-court-69559

According to officials, a major challenge in the Covid-combat is speed, cost, accuracy and accessibility for use. Several startups have developed innovative ways to address these needs and what the DST is doing is supporting the most promising to facilitate their development to commercialisation chain if found suitable on technical grounds. “Since the disease spreads through contagion, cleaning of hands, as well as commonly used surfaces like tables, computers, chair, mobile phones, and locks, is very essential to slow down the spread. The use of soap or alcohol can destroy the thin outer layer of fat that covers the virus, but the ready availability of soap and water is a challenge. The access and regulation of usage of the alcohol-water mixture is difficult too,” they said.  The formulation can provide a convenient and effective way to clean hands and surfaces and is totally natural and alcohol-free.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/alcohol-free-sanitiser-thats-gentle-on-skin-69558

The rest weren’t airlifted as they were Covid positive.The petitioner pointed out that India brought back its citizens from other countries but didn’t make any effort to evacuate those stranded in Gulf region. As the host countries wanted to take care of their citizens first, the Indian migrant workers were not being given treatment even after many of them tested positive for Covid-19, the PIL alleged.The plea stated there was a high risk of virus transmission among them as they lived in crammed conditions. The petitioner also demanded financial aid to those migrant workers in Gulf who lost their jobs.Maintaining that the government was under constitutional obligation to protect these Indian migrant workers in this extraordinary time “which has threatened the very existence of the human race,” the PIL sought directions to the Centre to ensure that adequate food, medicines, quarantine and emergency service facilities were made available to them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/evacuate-indians-stuck-in-gulf-pil-in-apex-court-69557

The US has criticised the WHO for "helping China suppress information" early on virus spread.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for a ceasefire among warring parties in different parts of the world and cautioned of the threat of terrorist groups exploiting the diversion of attention of most governments to battling the Covid epidemic.The weakness of the global community in handling the epidemic reflects the world’s lack of preparedness in case of a bio-terrorist attack, he pointed out in an address to the first meeting of the UN Security Council on the epidemic.In a broadside at China which resisted the convening of the UNSC on grounds that the Covid epidemic was a purely a health issue, Guterres said the engagement by the world’s premier body would be “critical” to mitigate the peace and security implications of Covid.“Indeed, a signal of unity and resolve will count for a lot at this anxious time,” observed the UN Secretary General, against the backdrop of a tussle between China and the US.China says the epidemic is a global challenge and appreciates the role of the WHO and the UN in this regard. In an effort to stave off criticism about holding back information about the spread of the virus in Heibei province, China points out that it is currently helping 100 countries combat the virus.The US has attacked the WHO for helping China suppress information early on in the spread of the virus, a mistake for which the world is paying a heavy price.“To prevail against the pandemic today, we will need to work together. That means heightened solidarity,” reiterated Guterres at the closed-door meeting with UNSC members.Efforts to discuss the coronavirus situation in the Council were stalled till now mainly due to the stalemate between Washington and Beijing.The Council’s two veto-wielding permanent members have been arguing over the origins of the virus and how any possible Council statement or resolution should reflect that.Sources said there was no discussion during the meeting on a resolution on the COVID-19 situation.US Ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft, in a veiled reference to China, said, “The most effective way to contain this pandemic is through accurate, science-based data collection and analysis of the origins, characteristics, and spread of the virus. We cannot stress enough how important these methods are.”China’s Ambassador to the United Nations Zhang Jun said to overcome this global challenge, “solidarity, cooperation, mutual support and assistance is what we need. Any acts of stigmatisation and politicization must be rejected.”(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/world-lacks-readiness-to-deal-with-bio-terror-attack-says-un-69447
11-04-2020||New Delhi||No community transmission, says government; spike in fresh cases, 239 deaths||‘Enough HCQ Buffer’On the day ICMR found Covid-19 disease in random samples taken from pneumonia patients hospitalised across the country, the government said India was still not in community transmission stage.“There is no community transmission of the disease in India as of now. We will be the first to tell you once the transmission stage is breached. Until then, we urge everyone to follow lockdown and respiratory and hand hygiene which is still the best way to contain the disease. If everyone cooperates, we can succeed against Covid-19. If even one person falters, we all fail,” Health Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said. The government response came after India recorded the highest single-day rise of 1,027 in Covid-19 cases and 40 deaths, taking the national case total to 7500 and toll to 239. The ICMR today published findings that 104 (1.8 per cent) of the 5,911 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome patients (random patients hospitalised with severe pneumonia) tested for Covid had confirmed positive.“These cases were reported from 52 districts in 20 states and UTs. The Covid-19 positivity was higher among males and patients aged above 50 years. In all, 40 (39.2 per cent) Covid-19 cases did not report any history of contact with a known case or international travel,” the ICMR said.The study was done to identify the extent of Covid transmission and took random samples from SARI patients at 41 hospital sites from February 15 until March 19.Initially, India was testing only three categories of high-risk people for Covid – symptomatic recent travellers, symptomatic contacts of travellers and symptomatic health workers. But when the testing strategy was expanded to include random SARI patients, they also tested positive even when they had no travel history. — TNSLower than global death rate of 5.98%New Delhi: Despite India reporting over 205 Covid-19 deaths in the past one month, the country’s death rate of about 3% is lower than the global rate of 5.98% and also much lower than several European nations like the UK, Italy and Spain, say experts. Suggesting that a relatively young Indian population may be key to low mortality rate, they have attributed high fatalities in countries like Italy and Spain to elderly population.

According to the complaint, the Wadhawan family had no medical or family emergency to visit the place and they had not obtained any permission in this regard.While all 23 persons who came to Mahabaleshwar have been sent to a quarantine facility by Satara authorities, Gupta has been sent on compulsory leave and a probe has been initiated against him. Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate today issued seizure orders for the five vehicles used by the Wadhawans to travel to their farmhouse.SPL Principal Secy faces probeMaharashtra Government has sent Special Principal Secretary in the Home Department Amitabh Gupta on compulsory leave and initiated a probe against him for facilitating the Mahabaleshwar trip of the DHFL promoters.Don’t release them, says CBIThe CBI has asked Satara authorities not to release Wadhawan brothers from quarantine facility without its approval as they face non-bailable warrants in the Yes Bank fraud case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wadhawans-booked-for-defying-lockdown-69311
