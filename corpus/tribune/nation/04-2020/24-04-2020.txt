The passenger traffic has declined 47 per cent.Besides, the grouping noted that the revenue impact for airlines operating to and from the Indian market would be USD 11.221 billion (over Rs 85,000 crore).This refers to the fall in passenger revenue compared to 2019.The “passenger demand impact (origin destination volumes)” is a fall of more than 8.97 crore.All the figures are for the period of 2020 so far compared to the whole of 2019.IATA is a grouping of nearly 290 airlines, including Air India, Vistara, IndiGo and SpiceJet.On April 14, IATA said COVID-19 crisis would see global airline passenger revenues drop by USD 314 billion this year, a fall of 55 per cent compared to 2019.Airlines in the Asia-Pacific region would record the largest revenue drop of USD 113 billion in 2020 compared to last year.These estimates are based on a scenario of severe travel restrictions lasting for three months, with a gradual lifting of restrictions in domestic markets, followed by regional and intercontinental, as per IATA.“The situation is deteriorating.  Airlines are in survival mode. They face a liquidity crisis with a USD 61 billion cash burn in the second quarter,” Conrad Clifford, IATA’s Regional Vice President (Asia-Pacific) said.According to him, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka and Thailand are priority countries that need to take action.Further, the grouping called for a combination of direct financial support, loans, loan guarantees and support for the corporate bond market, and tax relief for the airlines industry.“Providing support for airlines has a broader economic implication. Jobs across many sectors will be impacted if airlines do not survive the COVID-19 crisis. Every airline job supports another 24 in the travel and tourism value chain.“In Asia-Pacific, 11.2 million jobs are at risk, including those that are dependent on the aviation industry, such as travel and tourism,” Clifford said.

Despite that it was listed within a few hours from being filed, he said.Kansal said a matter filed on April 17 was yet to be listed and heard by the top court despite several complaints made to the Registry.Alleging discriminatory practice in listing of cases by the Registry, he requested the SC Secretary-General to take steps against the “pick-and-choose policy” adopted by the Registry.This listing was done without pointing out any defects in the petition or urgency letter and a previous list of pending cases was ignored in the process, he alleged. It was a routine issue for the SC Registry to favour certain specific lawyers and law firms when it came to listing of cases, Kansal said terming it “discrimination”.However, SCBA Secretary Ashok Arora contradicted Kansal’s claim.“I have made enquiries from the Registry. There is no discrimination. Arnab’s matter was not related to COVID. Reepak’s matter is related to COVID and has been sent to the COVID (relevant) Bench, which would approve the listing for its next sitting, which is likely to be Monday,” Arora said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lawyer-accuses-sc-registry-of-preferential-listing-of-arnab-goswamis-petition-75621

Another 10 lakh are said to be stranded in various states who are expected to return.Earlier, CM Yogi had set up a committee to work on a detailed plan to employ the returning migrants in the state.The mandate of the committee is to provide migrants employment opportunities at the local level that will strengthen the rural economy.The committee has been asked to explore opportunities under the state’s ambitious One District One Product Programme aimed at encouraging and branding indigenous and specialised products and crafts as well as ensuring employment.The state government has also announced to issue job cards and allocate work to migrants under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme on a priority basis.The committee is headed by the Commissioner Agricultural Production and includes principal secretaries of the departments of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Rural Development, Panchayati Raj and Skill Development.Earlier the Uttar Pradesh Government had sent over 100 buses to bring back more than 10,000 coaching students stranded in Kota. The students are undergoing home quarantine.At that time, there was strong demand from the opposition leaders to make similar arrangements to bring back the migrants.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-government-to-bring-back-migrant-labourers-from-various-states-in-phased-manner-75615

Post-mortem revealed high creatinine levels, the official said.“Only a few officials were present during cremation of the tiger carcass, which was done in accordance with guidelines issued in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak,” he said, adding, “Samples have been sent to Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly, for coronavirus testing.”Former member secretary of Central Zoo Authority (CZA) DN Singh on Friday alleged lapses on the part of the zoo authorities.“The tigress seems to have died due to dehydration. A senior veterinary officer from Jabalpur had advised the zoo officials to administer saline through rectum, as it is easier to absorb in the body this way, but the zoo staff did not do that,” Singh alleged.“Also, no senior official was present when the animal was being cremated, which is in violation of the rules,” he said.In September last year, an eight-year-old tiger, Rama, had died of kidney failure in Delhi zoo. A blood report had stated that very high phosphorus content and creatinine levels impacted the functioning of the animal’s kidneys.         Earlier this month, the Environment Ministry and National Tiger Conservation Authority had issued strict guidelines to minimise human-animal interface after a tiger in the Bronx Zoo, in the US, contracted coronavirus from an infected caretaker.The CZA had also asked zoos across the country to remain on “highest” alert and collect samples fortnightly in suspected cases.The samples can be sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Disease in Bhopal, the National Research Centre on Equines in Haryana’s Hisar and the Indian Veterinary Research Institute in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh.

24-04-2020||Kota||Kota: 1,400 students from Haryana, Assam leave for home; those from Bihar stage stir||Nearly 1,400 students from Haryana and Assam left Kota for their home towns by buses on Friday morning, while over 2,000 from various places in Rajasthan are scheduled to leave in the evening.Meanwhile, students from Bihar have appealed to Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of their home state, to make arrangements for their return and staged a silent protest here.Over 50 students from the Union territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Diu had left for home in three buses on Thursday noon and more than 250 students from Rajasthan had left for their respective home districts till Thursday night.Eighteen buses carrying students from Assam and 31 with students from Haryana were scheduled to leave Kota on Friday, ADM (administration), Kota, Narendra Gupta, who is monitoring the task, said.At least 50 students from Dadra and Nagar Haveli and six from Diu had left Kota in three buses on Thursday noon, while students from Bundi, Jhalawar and Baran in Rajasthan were dispatched in 10 buses on Thursday night, he added.Nearly 1,000 students from Haryana left for home on Friday morning and about 400 students from Assam have started the journey towards their home state.The Assam Government had hired buses from private operators to take the students from the state back home, an official of a coaching institute who is associated with the task of sending students home, said.Over 2,000 students from various cities and towns of Rajasthan were also scheduled to leave Kota in the evening, he added.“The Haryana Government has heard our plight and sent buses to take us back home. We are grateful to the Haryana Government,” Anjali Singh, an NEET aspirant who hails from Gurugram, said.Meanwhile, over 12,000 students from Bihar, who are stuck here since the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus was imposed, appealed to Kumar to call them back on Thursday.They held up placards with the appeal written on those from their respective places while maintaining social distancing.Shahbaz (18), an NEET aspirant, and his roommate in a paying guest accommodation, Aajam Hussain, both from Bihar’s Katihar district, said they were desperate to go home  as it was getting more and more difficult to spend even a single day here amid a critical problem of food and the panic surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.The approval to send back 190 students from Punjab and nearly 500 from Jammu and Kashmir is yet to be received from the respective states governments, a district official said.At least 13,000 students from Uttar Pradesh, 2,800 from Madhya Pradesh and 350 from Gujarat had already reached their home towns from Kota, which is known for its coaching centres to prepare students for competitive exams, in the last few days, he added.

24-04-2020||New Delhi||Rohtang pass set to open||The vital road access to  Ladakh and parts of Himachal Pradesh, across the Rohtang pass near Manali is set to open up in a day or two.The Indian Army will double up stocking up on rations for the winter period in Ladakh and Siachen, and items of use by the civilian population will also start moving.The Union Territory of Ladkah is emerging from its first winter since it was carved out as separate entity in August last year following changes to the Article 370 of the Indian Constitution.Ladakh has two access roads—one is the 475 km Srinagar-Leh road over the Zoji-La and other is 477 km Manali-Leh  road via Rohtang, a 13,050 feet high massif. Both remain closed for 6-7 months due to heavy snowfall.The road across the Zoji-La (11,570 feet high) opened last week while work is final stages to open the Rohtang route.“The road could be opened during the coming weekend, provided the weather remains clear for the machines to cut through the ice”, a source said.During winters, men and rations can only be moved onboard the military planes from Chandigarh. All equipment is moved during the summer months.Ladakh shares a 823-km front with China. The Siachen glacier is located  here and so is the sensitive Kargil-Drass section, which faces Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir  (PoK).Fuel, kerosene oil, heavy clothing, fuel wood, material for pre-fabricated structures---all that is needed for its troops in this remote Himalayan region---will have to be stocked during the next five months. Winter stocks have to be replenished if the forces are to sustain troops during the winter months. Road links to Ladakh get cut off around the late October.The summer months are crucial as the road is used for stocking up wheat, rice, sugar, clothes, cement, steel, LPG cylinders, medicines, shoes, etc for the local population.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rohtang-pass-set-to-open-75609
24-04-2020||New Delhi||IMD predicts wet days ahead as studies show correlation between COVID-19 and hot/humid weather||Amid increasing evidence of direct correlation between the deadly COVID-19 and hot and humid weather, the good news for India is that the IMD is predicting reasonably wet days and above normal temperatures for most parts of the country in days to come.Some studies have again reiterated that warmer temperatures and humid weather significantly damages the novel coronavirus.And on a day Health Minister Harsh Vardhan’s positive outlook, including that India had been saved from the Stage 3 or the community transfer stage, the general feeling is perhaps apart from lockdown and management, its weather conditions may also have helped.If the studies hold good, the good news is weather conditions will continue to favour India’s COVID-19 fight.According to the IMD, due to continued moisture incursion, strong wind convergence and conducive upper level features, fairly widespread rains will continue over parts of east and northeast and also West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand and Bihar.Rain activity is also expected to increase over Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu over the next five days.Moisture influx from the Arabian Sea and low level easterlies from the Bay of Bengal are likely to cause rains over Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh between April 26 and 28 and plains of the northwest, mainly Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, over next two daysWhile rains are expected to continue beyond April 30 as well, many parts are reporting above normal temperatures.  According to this latest report from the US, “sunlight kills COVID-19 and warmer temperatures and humid weather significantly damage the virus, measured in terms of the virus’ half life or the time it takes to cut its potency in half”.The interesting part is that though researchers are working on the link since the virus hit the world, this particular report from the US Department of Homeland Security is being called the “first official stamp” on the correlation. “Our most striking observation to date is the powerful effect that solar light appears to have on killing the virus, both on surfaces and in the air. We’ve seen a similar effect with both temperature and humidity as well. Increasing the temperature and humidity or both is generally less favourable to the virus,” reports quoted Bill Bryan, chief of the science and technology directorate at the US Department of Homeland Security, as saying.While in a room at 70-75F ( around 21 C to 23 C) temperature with 20 per cent humidity, the half life of the virus is about an hour outside it cuts down to a minute and a half, very significant difference when it is hit with UV rays, he said.This is good news for a country like India blessed with sunny days approaching pre-monsoon and monsoon days.Also according to IMD, from April 30 to May 6 cumulatively rainfall is expected to be normal to above normal across Western Himalayan Region and maximum temperatures increase by 1-2 C in most parts. As India heads towards a particularly hot season, researchers expect COVID-19 to follow the “marked seasonality” shown by its genetic cousins prevailing among humans since centuries.In other words the corona family is generally more volatile between December and April, giving a good reason to believe to researchers that soon its impact will lessen.Earlier a preliminary study of progression trends by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers had indicated lesser cases in hotter zones.Qasim Bukhari and Yusuf Jameel of MIT concluded that  90 per cent of the transmissions until March 22 occurred in regions with temperature between 3 C and 17 C and absolute humidity between 4 to 9g/m3 (grams per cubic metre). “Wherever the temperatures were colder, the number of the cases started increasing quickly. You see this in Europe, even though the health care there is among the world’s best,” they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/imd-predicts-wet-days-ahead-as-studies-show-correlation-between-covid-19-and-hot-humid-weather-75608
24-04-2020||Shubhadeep Choudhury                                                                   ||Controversial Bengal committee on corona deaths under scanner||Tribune News Service Kolkata, April 24 The Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) sent to Kolkata by the Centre to examine the implementation of lockdown measures and also assess various steps related to containing the spread of COVID-19 in the state has pulled up the state government over the issue of constitution of a committee to certify deaths caused by novel coronavirus infection.In a letter written to West Bengal Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha, IMCT team head Apurva Chandra, Additional Secretary with the GoI, said that answer given to him by Principal Secretary (Health) of West Bengal on the setting up of the committee was not satisfactory.“The Principal Secretary (Health) in his presentation on April 23, 2020, gave some reasons for establishment of the committee and also mentioned that if a COVID patient dies in a road accident, he cannot be said to have died of COVID”, Chandra wrote.He added that they did not find the reasoning convincing as there could be no comparison between a road death and a death in hospital owing to disease.Chandra asked for a copy of the order constituting the committee of doctors, saying it would help them understand the issue better.Chandra also asked for case records of all such COVID patients whose cause of death was attributed to some other health problem by the committee. The IMCT leader also sought information about time taken by the committee to give a conclusive report.Chandra further wrote that he would also like to know that if such a committee to ascertain the cause of death existed in West Bengal for any other disease.He also asked whether such a committee for certification of death was in line with ICMR guidelines on medical practice.The ICMT leader concluded his letter by seeking an interaction with the committee so that he could “understand their methodology”.Earlier this month, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee set up the committee of five doctors to judge whether death of a patient, who had tested corona positive, had died of coronavirus infection or owing to some other comorbidity.While opposition political parties have alleged that the committee has been formed by the CM to fudge the figure related to the number of people dying in COVID and contracting the virus in the state, many people in the medical fraternity too have expressed outrage at the move.Pratim Sengupta, one such doctor, who is a consultant nephrologist with a reputed Kolkata clinic, wrote on his Facebook page last week, “Either expert committee members need to come in each case and examine the patient and certify death or else the treating physicians must write down the cause of death. It’s a tremendous insult to entire medical fraternity”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/controversial-bengal-committee-on-corona-deaths-under-scanner-75607

24-04-2020||Tribune Web Desk||TN cops teach lockdown violators a befitting lesson, push 3 boys into ambulance with 'Covid patient'||Chandigarh, April 24From corona-shaped helmets to drawing paintings on roads, Tamil Nadu police have been innovating new methods to send out stern warning to lockdown violators.The latest, recorded on camera by policemen in Tiruppur town, has gone viral.The three-minute-long video shows three motorcycle-borne boys, without masks and helmets, being intercepted by the police.The boys try to evade questioning by the police team on the violation amid the lockdown. The cops are heard warning the boys that they would be taught a "lesson for lifetime".Minutes later, the cops push the boys into an ambulance with a man faking as a corona patient lying on a stretcher. Stunned by the sight of a "corona patient", the boys are seen screaming and trying to wriggle out. But after a brief struggle, the police team shove the boys inside the ambulance much to their horror.They traumatised boys jump off the ambulance. The video then shows a cop explaining the rationale behind the move. "It was when they thought there was a corona patient inside that they realised that their lives were in danger. When you roam outside, you don’t know where you’d get the virus from. It could be anywhere. It’s for this reason that the government says stay home. Stay home. Don’t go out. If you are compelled to go for any reason, please wear your masks,’’ the officer is heard saying.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tn-cops-teach-lockdown-violators-a-befitting-lesson-push-3-boys-into-ambulance-with-covid-patient-75605

24-04-2020||New Delhi||Anxiety and angst as Indians mark one month of lockdown||It has been a month. Of life slowing to a crawl, of going back to the basics, of recalibrating equations with family, friends and colleagues and waking up, as if from a dream, to the vast inequalities and commonalities that underlie Indian society.On the evening of March 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the entire country would go under lockdown from midnight to stem the spread of coronavirus. In the days since, 1.3 billion Indians, wealthy and poor, in the heartland and distant corners, have faced up to the fear of a pandemic spreading across the globe.No one was spared the anxiety of a coronavirus forced lockdown, extended till May 3, that kept most of India behind closed doors, not corporate biggies in gilded mansions, not the middle class inside their homes and not part-time domestic workers in claustrophobic tenements.That was the equaliser, but the inequalities also hit home almost immediately. As India went quiet and millions snuck into their homes to wait out the lockdown, migrant workers and daily wagers, stranded miles away from home, stared at an uncertain future without money, food or jobs.Most middle and upper-class families found it challenging to spend so much time with their immediate families, and many isolated without them spiralled into depression.The journey of getting used to a new way of life – without domestic help, without the necessity of dressing up to step out and just staying cooped up indoors—has been out of the ordinary, equal parts good, bad and ugly.According to Preeti Singh, a clinical psychologist at Gurgaon's Paras hospital, the lockdown has encouraged people to differentiate between a need and a want and helped them “prioritise their requirements”.“It has helped people realise that one can survive with a minimalist lifestyle, and the futility of all the materialism that drives the world,” Singh told PTI.From these 30 days—that will go down as one of life's markers, an always-to-be-remembered month—emerged innovative ways of social interaction, celebrations and even mourning in keeping with the need for social distancing.It has been an extraordinary time of looking inwards to rediscover reserves of strength and sometimes hidden talents, said many people.Chetna Beniwal, a customs inspector posted in Madurai and now with her parents in Gurgaon, said the lockdown has been an opportunity to discover the joy of simply talking with her family.“Due to my work, I hardly get to visit home so I have actually been enjoying staying with my parents. I have realised that when you spend more time together, you get to know the small issues of the house,” the 28-year-old told PTI.For some, the challenging part was to spend most of the day confined at home with a close relative, even if one hugely loved, be it parent, child or spouse.“I am finding it hard to be around my father 24/7,” said Kolkata-based Indrani Paul.“I have realised that staying within the walls of your own house can be as difficult as staying 10 hours in the office. It is as good as being under house arrest,” the 29-year-old said.Families, however, have come closer too.Mahender Sahni, a Delhi-based plumber, was in his village in Bihar when the lockdown was announced. He hasn't earned a rupee since March but said he has become closer to his sister, who has been helping him and his wife out with ration and food.“She has been very kind to us,” the 56-year-old said.Jammu-based Kamla Devi, 71, said she is happy her sons can spend time with their children but the future of their restaurant and catering business fills her with anxiety.“All bookings for weddings in the last month had to be cancelled, and our employees need to be paid. We are extremely anxious about the days ahead,” she said.She is also lonely and missing her friends.“What I have missed the most is going to the park for my evening walk and chatting with my friends. I am spending more time on WhatsApp and phone calls these days,” she said.According to Singh, Kamla Devi's loneliness is not uncommon in these trying times and can be seen across all age groups.“Mental health has taken a hit with increasing cases of anxiety, depression, mood swings, obsessive-compulsive disorder among others. There are also cases of alcohol abuse, increased anger issues, domestic violence, and marital discord,” the doctor said.In times like these, “lack of emotional support often leads to a sense of hopelessness”.At least 30 people have reportedly committed suicide due to the fear, anxiety and panic of being in isolation.The extended lockdown has put normal life on hold. Even treatment for illnesses, regular medical check-ups and health problems other than COVID-19.Ricky Sharma's brother ended up with a gum infection after he was unable to see a dentist.“My brother had intense pain due to his wisdom tooth but no doctor agreed to see him. Eventually, a local chemist prescribed a medicine. But it hasn't been of much help. He is still in pain,” Sharma, an IT professional in Gurgaon, said.According to Shweta Sharma, a psychologist at Gurgaon's Columbia Asia Hospital, there are challenges in surviving a lockdown but it is also important to look at the positive aspects and take some of them forward in a post corona life.“This lockdown made people recognise the true value of relationships, and teamwork while sharing household responsibilities. Pollution-free environment and consumption of homemade food have been the valuable perks of this lockdown.“These are also things that must continue after the pandemic. Perhaps, work from home can be accommodated in our routines to regulate pollution, and save resources, and exercising at home must continue, as should a certain amount of ‘me time',” Sharma said.Actor Rajeev Khandelwal who was in his holiday home in Goa when the lockdown came into effect, said his biggest takeaway has been that one “should not be dependent on others for his/her happiness”."It should not be borrowed happiness. One should not feel frustrated if they cannot step out of the house if there is no one around them. One should be able to spend time with oneself. It is important to find things to engage with to find happiness.”Lubdhak Chatterjee, a Kolkata-based filmmaker, said the most difficult thing to come to terms with has been the “fragile” nature of human life as well as the “collective lifestyle of the modern world”.“This has been a more challenging reality to accept than just being restricted to my home, and the process is psychologically draining.

24-04-2020||New Delhi||India's one month of lockdown: Experts feel it helped in preventing 'US or Europe-like' situation||As India completes a month under lockdown that brought the world's most populous democracy to a virtual standstill, with no or very minimal social and economic activities to prevent the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, several medical experts feel that these restrictions were crucial in preventing a "US or Europe-like" situation from materialising in the country.             However, most of the experts also cautioned that a "bigger challenge" awaits the country when it gradually move towards exiting the nationwide lockdown, which has emerged as one of India's biggest weapons so far in the battle against COVID-19.               India's first case was reported on January 30, and 54 days later on March 25, with 519 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 11 deaths, the country was put under a 21-day complete lockdown, hence starting the country's full-blown battle against the pandemic.At the end of the first month of the lockdown on Friday, the total number of coronavirus cases has crossed the 23,000 mark and there are 718 deaths due to COVID-19 in the country. Globally, the total number of cases of infections are over 27.3 lakh and more than1.91 lakh people have died due to the virus with the US and the UK along with some other European countries among the worst affected nations.          After a three week period that ended on April 14, Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the countrywide lockdown for 19 additional days till May 3 to contain the spread of the pandemic.Though, the number of infections kept on rising through the period of the lockdown, experts believe it is not "alarming" and the situation seems to be under control in India as compared to the US and several other western nations where cases have skyrocketed and the death toll is mounting.            After a week into the lockdown, the tally of cases reached 1,397 and 35 deaths on March 31, a jump of 878 cases and 24 deaths, while at the end of two weeks of the lockdown on April 7, the cases had risen to 4,789 with 124 deaths, witnessing a spike of 3,392 cases and 89 deaths.On the last day of the 21-day first phase lockdown, the death toll due to the coronavirus stood at 353 with the number of cases soaring to 10,815.The third week of the lockdown saw a jump of 6,026 cases and 229 deaths.             The next 10 days saw a spike of 365 deaths and 12,262 cases. As per the Union health ministry Friday update, the death toll due to COVID-19 is 718 and the number of cases 23,077.               Though only a detailed study would be able to throw light on the success of the lockdown, medical experts feel it was necessary and India's situation would have been even more precarious in its absence.                Dr Arvind Kumar, a noted lung surgeon at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said the month-long lockdown has been "immensely beneficial" for India and prevented a "US or Europe-like" situation from materialising in the country.            "More importantly, it has given us a golden 30 days time to prepare our health services and other support services to face the onslaught (of the virus) even if it was to come in the ensuing days," he told PTI.            Kumar also said that as a healthcare worker he would like to see a decision on extension of the lockdown around April 30 or May 1 after assessing the situation at the time.           "Lifting of lockdown should be very gradual. Some facilities should remain closed through the month of May like schools, colleges, malls, cinema halls, religious places and markets. Certain sectors feeling the pinch should open but only in green zones, while red and orange zones should continue in lockdown," he said.               Ravi Shekhar Jha, Senior Consultant and Head of the Department, Pulmonology, Fortis Escorts Faridabad, also hailed the government's decision to impose the lockdown in containing the virus, saying it was "timely".               He, however, asserted that the lifting of lockdown will be "the real challenge", and advocated its phased lifting after identification of hotspots and allowing only essential services there.              The exit from the lockdown has to be based on a very analytical approach, giving priority to scientific rather than economic considerations, he told PTI.         Dr Rommel Tickoo, Associate Director, Internal Medicine, Max healthcare, said the lockdown has been quite beneficial for India when compared to the situation in the US and Europe.           "Ours was quite timely. We have over 20,000 cases, so if you compare it with the US and Europe, definitely we are in a much better condition. Mortality rate is also lower in India at round 3 per cent," he told PTI.         Asked if a bigger challenge awaits India in lifting the lockdown, Tickoo said restrictions should be lifted in a phased manner.         He also suggested that India can take a leaf out of countries like Sweden and put restrictions on elderly and those with comorbid conditions for 2-3 months as they seem to be more vulnerable to the virus.         The lockdown period has not just been about numbers but also about the dogged resolve of a nation to overcome a crisis, about sacrifices and the fearless service of COVID-19 warriors such as healthcare workers, police personnel and sanitation workers.               The period of 31 days of lockdown has also had its share of hiccups with social distancing guidelines going for a toss on certain occasions -- from thousands of migrant workers thronging Anand Vihar bus terminus on the Delhi-UP border in the earlier stages of the shutdown to a crowd of migrant labourers gathering in suburban Bandra earlier this month.              The government has maintained that if not for the lockdown and other containment measures such as contact tracing and isolation, the numbers of coronavirus cases would have been sky-high.             The health ministry has also maintained that the rate of rise in confirmed cases would have been much lower, but for the Tablighi Jamaat event at Delhi's Nizamuddin last month.         While on the one hand, heart-wrenching stories of migrant laborers walking hundreds of miles to reach home emerged, at the other, inspiring incidents of healthcare workers fearlessly fighting the pandemic came to the fore during the one month of lockdown.           But, one dominant theme that seemed to dwarf everything else, is a determination of a nation to fight the seemingly long battle against COVID-19 to emerge victorious.

24-04-2020||Mumbai/Ahmedabad||India's lower death rates seems to defy coronavirus trend||Parts of India have recorded dramatic falls in mortality rates after a nationwide lockdown was imposed to fight the new coronavirus, suggesting there has not been an undetected surge in virus-related deaths.All over the world, mortality rates are being scrutinised to determine the true impact of the coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year and is known to have infected more than 2.7 million people globally, with nearly 1,90,000 deaths.While death rates in some countries have risen sharply in recent weeks, in India the opposite seems to be happening, at least in some places, leaving hospitals, funeral parlours and cremation sites wondering what is going on."It's very surprising for us," said Shruthi Reddy, chief executive officer of Anthyesti Funeral Services, which operates in the eastern city of Kolkata and the southern tech hub of Bengaluru.The company handled about five jobs a day in January but has only had about three a day this month."We've declared employee pay cuts if revenue falls below a threshold," Reddy said.Other numbers tell a similar story.Central Mumbai, home to some 12 million people, saw deaths fall by about 21 per cent in March compared with the same month of 2019, according to municipal data.Overall deaths plummeted 67 per cent in Ahmedabad, over the same period.Data from at least two other cities, along with accounts from state health officials, show a similar pattern. Half a dozen funeral businesses and crematoriums also reported slumps in business, especially in April."If we're not seeing an increase in deaths, the suspicion that there may be more COVID-19 fatalities out there is not true," said Giridhar Babu, professor of epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India.Fewer accidentsModi imposed a lockdown of India's 1.3 billion people on March 25 in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected some 23,077 people, killing 718 of them, according to the latest figures.India has tested about 525,000 people, meaning some 4 per cent were positive. In the United Sates, about 18 per cent of tests are positive, according to the COVID Tracking project.India's apparently lower death rates stand in contrast to what has been seen elsewhere.The Netherlands recorded about 2,000 more deaths than normal in the first week of April, for example, while in Indonesia's capital of Jakarta the number of funerals rose sharply in March.Some towns in Italy also saw a jump in recorded deaths.Indian doctors, officials and crematorium employees suspect the lower death rate is in large part attributable to fewer road and rail accidents."Road accident cases, and even patients with alcohol or drug abuse, stroke and heart attacks have been coming in fewer numbers," said Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma, health minister for the northeastern state of Assam.Accidents on India's chaotic roads killed more than 151,400 people in 2018, according to official data, the world's highest absolute number.The coronavirus lockdown, which is due to end on May 3, will cut road deaths by at least 15 per cent this year compared with 2018, Paresh Kumar Goel, a director at the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, said.With passenger trains halted, fatalities from all-too-common rail accidents have also plunged. In Mumbai alone, for example, more than half a dozen people typically die every day on the rail network.Fewer murders too?Neeraj Kumar, who is in charge of a crematorium on the banks of the holy Ganges river in Uttar Pradesh state, said victims of crime were also not being brought in."We used to get at least 10 accident-related bodies every day and many related to murder cases. But after the lockdown we're only receiving natural death cases," Kumar said.The site used to perform up to 30 cremations a day but in the month since March 22, only 43 people had been cremated, Kumar said after leafing through the crematorium's record book.But the lower rates might also reflect difficulties in reporting deaths during the lockdown, officials said."There could be an increase when the lockdown ends," said Dr Bhavin Joshi, a senior health department official with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation.Requests for India-wide data from the national registrar went unanswered, while an official at the New Delhi Municipal Council said they could not provide numbers.Reuters was also unable to obtain data for the state of West Bengal, where some doctors have accused the government of understating coronavirus deaths.Only a state-appointed committee is allowed to declare that a patient has died from the virus.Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-lower-death-rates-seems-to-defy-coronavirus-trend-75577

Whether in the NHS (National Health Service) or as key workers in other roles, or through the wonderful work done by volunteers and local initiatives in temples, mosques and gurdwaras to support all members of all communities," said the Prince of Wales, in a video message for the Trust."I wanted to lend my support to the launch of an emergency appeal to help those who are suffering most across India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.“Today to play its part in responding to this pandemic, the British Asian Trust, in partnership with local organisations and governments, is ramping up its work to support the daily basic needs of the poorest and the most vulnerable," he said.As he appealed for donations to the new fundraiser, the royal highlighted that across South Asia an estimated 40 million children are in need and over 400 million daily workers have seen their livelihoods disappear with no form of income and no savings.“They and their families now face a fight for survival," he said.The Trust, founded by Prince Charles in 2007 to fight poverty across South Asia, said that without the daily work they relied on, many in the region simply do not have any money to pay for food or medicine for their loved ones during this most unprecedented crisis.“I started the British Asian Trust 13 years ago with the help of members of the British Asian community to support those in greatest need in South Asia.“Over this time, the Trust has supported nearly 5 million people… with your generosity, the British Asian Trust will help those who have nowhere else to turn and offer hope to those who face the most desperate circumstances. With your help, we can make a difference,” said Prince Charles.The Trust has set up an online donation system on its website, inviting people to donate from as little as three pounds, either as a one-off donation or a monthly amount.“We have shown great togetherness and commitment for our communities here in the UK. Now, more than ever, families back in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka need you,” the Trust said in reference to the new fundraiser.

24-04-2020||New Delhi||Freezing of DA insensitive, inhumane; govt should shelve bullet train, Central Vista projects: Cong||Noting that it was “insensitive and inhumane” to freeze dearness allowance, the Congress on Friday said instead of “hurting” the middle-class employees and pensioners, the government should shelve bullet train and Central Vista redevelopment projects to save money for the coronavirus fight.“It is an insensitive and inhumane decision of the government to cut DA of central employees, pensioners and jawans who are serving the public while fighting coronavirus, instead of suspending the bullet train project and the Central Vista beautification project of lakhs of crores (of rupees),” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.                        Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala asked the government to curtail 30 per cent of its own expenses and shelve the Central Vista redevelopment and bullet train projects to save money to be used to fight the COVID-19 outbreak.लाखों करोड़ की बुलेट ट्रेन परियोजना और केंद्रीय विस्टा सौंदर्यीकरण परियोजना को निलंबित करने की बजाय कोरोना से जूझ कर जनता की सेवा कर रहे केंद्रीय कर्मचारियों, पेंशन भोगियों और देश के जवानों का महंगाई भत्ता(DA)काटना सरकार का असंवेदनशील तथा अमानवीय निर्णय है।https://t.co/LTGPf53VsA  “The government of India, instead of helping people by giving them financial support in this crisis, is hurting them. Instead of curtailing its own wasteful expenditures, the government is cutting the money of the middle class people,” he told an online press conference.The government on Thursday froze inflation-linked allowance for its 1.1 crore employees and pensioners, a move states are likely to replicate, helping save a combined Rs 1.2 lakh crore that could be used to combat the coronavirus crisis.Surjewala demanded that the government cut its own wasteful expenses by 30 per cent that could yield around Rs 2.5 lakh-crore and take back its decision of freezing the dearness allowance and relief for employees, pensioners and defence personnel.He also accused the government of “misconceived” priorities and policies and said on one side the Prime Minister is telling states and the private sector not to cut salaries of its employees and on the other, he is himself cutting the salaries of government employees.“Is this not an indicator to the states and private sector...If this mayhem continues, how will you put money in the hands of people,” he asked.Surjewala said the government should shelve its Central Vista project of Rs 20,000 crore, of which the Prime Minister held a meeting even yesterday, as well as the Rs 1.10 lakh-crore bullet train project and not cut the money of common people.“Why are you attacking the incomes of the most vulnerable sections and instead not cutting your own waste expenditure,” he asked.The Congress has been critical of the government’s decision to freeze the dearness allowance of government employees from January 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021.

24-04-2020||---||Lockdown effective in controlling virus spread, says Health Ministry||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 24Lockdown has helped slow the spread of coronavirus infections in the country, Union Health Ministry said on Friday.The ministry said in its evening briefing that the doubling rate in the country has slowed to 10 days.“The decision to impose lockdown was timely and was effective in controlling coronavirus spread,” the ministry said.The ministry said that the country had reported 1,684 new COVID-19 cases in 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 23,077 with 718 reported deaths.Some 20.5 per cent people---4,748 patients--- have been cured so far, ministry officials said.“There has been no new case of COVID-19 from 80 districts in the last 14 days,” officials said at the press briefing. Officials said that the authorities were now conducting community surveillance at district and state levels to check community spread of the virus.Doubling rate is the rate at which infection doubles in the country.The COVID-19 situation continued to be grim in Maharashtra with 14 deaths and 778 new cases as on Thursday night, leaving other seriously hit states or union territories like Delhi, Telangana or Tamil Nadu far behind. With this, the state’s total fatalities shot up from 269 on Wednesday to 283 on Friday morning. The number of COVID-19 patients jumped to 6,430 on Friday.The national capital has seen 2,376 cases of COVID-19 with 50 fatalities.Rajasthan has witnessed 1,964 cases and 27 deaths while Tamil Nadu has seen 1,683 cases and 20 deaths so far. Gujarat too had seen a rise in numbers taking the total cases to 2,624. There has been 112 deaths in the state. Agencies'Lockdown helped prevent community transmission'Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said earlier in the day that the government had saved India from going into Stage 3 or community transmission stage, and India had also fared better than many countries, in the fight against the coronavirus, on various parameters."Testing has been made strong in the country. Today, we have already completed 5.5 lakh tests and after increasing our testing frequency our positive cases are not rising."The positive cases are not rising by more than 4 per cent...We were all worried if we are in Stage 3, but we have been able to save the country largely from going into Stage 3," Harsh Vardhan said, adding "we have all the information connected with clusters and hotspots." Responding to the issue of faulty testing kits, Vardhan said: "We will return the testing kits to their country of origin, and we have not paid money yet. Strategies were made to use these kits in hotspots."Faulty antibody testing kits will be returned irrespective of the country they were procured from, including China," added Vardhan.Detailing the country's progress in the past 3.5 months in tackling COVID-19, Vardhan added: "On January 8, we held our first meeting, and today, in comparison with many other countries, fighting against COVID-19, India has done very well."We have fewer cases per million percentage. We have a mortality of 3 per cent, which is less. The recovery rate of patients, who contracted a viral infection, is better than the world. In March, the doubling rate of coronavirus cases was 3 days; today it is close to 9 days."All over the country, wherever the virus is active, we have full information. And, we also know, what we have to do to tackle this virus in these areas," added Vardhan.He insisted that the country has a very well-defined strategy to deal with hotspots and also those districts which so far remain coronavirus free."We are in a better position to control the disease. Containment and surveillance strategies have been designed meticulously," said Vardhan.He added that lockdown has proved helpful in tackling the outbreak of the viral infection.NITI Ayog Member VK Paul said India would have crossed the one lakh case mark had Prime Minister Narendra Modi not taken the timely and bold decision to implement a national lockdown to prevent COVID 19 transmission, Member HealthChairman of the Government empowered committee on medical leaders' emergency response, Paul said the disease was under control and that, without a lockdown, there would have been exponential growth of cases.Paul also said all medical evidence in the field has suggested that India’s testing strategy has stood the test of time and would be reviewed depending on the shape the disease takes.Even with expanded testing our cases did not rise, he said.“What we are presenting is the true picture. Hospital ICUs are not filling with people; PMJAY scheme use hasn’t surged nor has the sale of cough and flu medicines. All this shows the disease is under control,” said Paul.

24-04-2020||Vijay Mohan||ITBP no longer to rotate battalions for anti-Naxal operations||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, April 24In a major policy shift, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force (ITBP) has done away with deploying battalions on a rotational basis in anti-Naxal operations. Instead, battalions already deployed in the anti-Naxal role will now become a permanent fixture and personnel will be transferred in an out on an individual basis.The rotation change over (RCO) of two battalions deployed in Chhattisgarh, which was due in May, has been cancelled, sources said. Orders to this effect were passed by the ITBP Director General SS Deswal on April 23, after a series of discussions with the force’s top brass, sources said. The tenure of a battalion in anti-Naxal operations was three years.From now on, no ITBP battalion will be earmarked for anti-Naxal operations. The RCO of battalions was being planned and executed by the Operations Directorate at ITBP Headquarters. The task of handling individual postings has been passed on to the Personnel Directorate and is expected to be handled in the same manner as other transfers in the force across all hierarchical levels, though the tenure mandated for individuals posted to such areas will be adhered to.The new policy has some semblance with the Army’s Rashtriya Rifles (RR) that is deployed in anti-terrorist role in Jammu and Kashmir. Unlike most regular Army battalions that move after a stipulated tenure at a station, an RR battalion has a fixed location and only the troops from different regiments to which an RR battalion is affiliated with, are rotated.The ITBP, which is responsible for the peace-time management of the border with China, has 56  service battalions, four specialist  battalions, seven logistics  establishments and 17 training  centres. Out of the 56 service battalions, 32 are deployed for border guarding, 11 in internal security and eight in anti-Naxal operations. The remaining five are reserved for rest and recuperation. Elements of the force also provide security to sensitive installations, banks and persons at security risk.Battalions that were deployed in anti-Naxal operations underwent a collective pre-induction training so that they were oriented for the specific task that was vastly different from border guarding duties.The new policy will have an impact on the training methodology. The ITBP’s Training Directorate has been directed to evolve a new mechanism for imparting necessary training to personnel being transferred to battalions located in the anti-Naxal theatre. The ITBP has a structured training programme for such deployments and is conducted by its Counter-Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/itbp-no-longer-to-rotate-battalions-for-anti-naxal-operations-75537

I am averse to imposing any restrictions on the media,” Justice DY Chandrachud said.Acting on the Republic TV Editor-in-Chief’s petition, the Supreme Court also issued notices to the states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Jammu and Kashmir Administration, where multiple FIRs have been lodged against Goswami.Probe into all cases, except the one lodged in Nagpur and ordered to be transferred to Mumbai, shall stand stayed, it said, adding no probe into fresh FIRs arising out of April 21 TV show will be done. The top court gave time to Goswami to club all FIRs and complaints, bring all of them on record and make the complainants parties to his petition.Asking Arnab to co-operate with the investigation into the matter, the Bench posted it for further hearing after eight weeks. Earlier, during the hearing senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi submitted on behalf of Goswami that the statements which have been attributed  to  the  Republic TV Editor-in-Chief were  based on a small part  of the overall programme.“If the programme is viewed in its entirety, no offence has been made out under Sections 153, 153A,  153B, 295A, 298, 500, 504 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code,” he said.“The man (Arnab) is not able to carry out his work...and his work of journalism. Those people who attacked him were caught and arrested. Freedom of speech and individual freedom is at stake,” Rohatgi said.On behalf of the Maharashtra Government, senior advocate Kapil Sibal countered Rohatgi’s submissions. Reading out the transcript of the “offending part of the telecast”, he said it was not only to an abuse of the freedom of speech and expression, but also amounted to the offences complained of. He urged the court not to stay probe.Senior advocate Manish Singhvi, representing the Rajasthan Government, supported Sibal’s submissions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-stays-coercive-action-against-arnab-goswami-for-3-weeks-75532

Owing to the pandemic, novel Coronavirus-related searches rose by a whopping 427 per cent.The top five COVID-19 keywords searched were 'COVID-19 updates', 'Symptoms of COVID-19', 'COVID-19 treatment', 'COVID-19 death toll' and 'live COVID-19 tracker.' People also mass-searched for 'lockdown in India,' 'vaccine for coronavirus', 'social distancing', and 'Hydroxychloroquine for coronavirus'. The latter is an anti-malarial drug that US President Donald Trump described as a "game changer" in the fight against the coronavirus crisis.During the pre-lockdown phase, actor Priyanka Chopra was the most searched female celebrity, followed by Katrina Kaif and Deepika Padukone. All this changed when 'Baby doll' singer Kanika Kapoor tested positive for COVID-19 on her return from London. Kapoor replaced these superstars to take the top spot and even ran into trouble for not self-quarantining on return.Post-lockdown, superstars Amitabh Bachchan and Rajinikanth topped the list of most searched male celebs.Yahoo's 'Search in the Lockdown,' chronicles and compares what users in India searched for before and during the lockdown, shows trends that are based on users' daily search habits in the last one month. Before COVID-19 began to rule the search bar, the top search keywords online for news, included 'Delhi election results,' 'Delhi riots/Delhi violence' and 'JNU violence'. The top searched keywords (people) included Donald Trump, Arvind Kejriwal and Jyotiraditya Scindia.During the global shutdown, netizens are also looking online for productivity tools while working from home, with video conferencing apps Zoom and Skype being the top two searches.In the entertainment arena, searches for 'Bigg Boss', 'Drive', 'Tanhaji', 'Housefull 4' and 'Good Newwz' were replaced by the old classic 'Ramayan' that was re-telecast on Doordarshan. Pandemic based movie 'Contagion' was also highly searched.Top questions Indians looked for answers to online during the lockdown are: What is COVID-19? How long does coronavirus live on surfaces? How to make a mask at home? Is there any vaccine for Coronavirus? Does Coronavirus spread through air? What happens to Coronavirus patients in quarantine?

24-04-2020||United Nations||International passenger capacity for India reduced by 89 per cent in April due to Covid-19: UN||International passenger capacity for India reduced by 89 per cent so far this month due to COVID-19 pandemic as compared to a “business-as-usual” scenario, according to the latest projections from the United Nations specialised agency for international civil aviation.The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) said that by September, the world could have 1.2 billion fewer international air travellers, compared to regular originally planned or “business-as-usual”.Estimates by the organisation show a dramatic reduction in international passenger capacity for countries across the world between January and April, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally.In February 2020, international passenger capacity reduced by 13 per cent, mainly related to traffic from/to states experiencing an early outbreak and states deeply interconnected to China.By March, global international passenger capacity reduced by 49 per cent, with significant reduction not only in states experiencing an early outbreak but also worldwide.In April 2020, global international passenger capacity so far experienced unprecedented 91 per cent reduction.For India, the international passenger capacity has reduced by 89 per cent so far in April or a negative 6,263,030 capacity change from originally planned or in a business as usual scenario.In January, there was zero reduction for India in international passenger capacity as the pandemic was in its nascent stages across most of the world, except China, and air travel was still not significantly impacted.The passenger capacity reduction was about 2 per cent for India in February.However by March, when the World Health Organisation had declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and infection rates were soaring across the world, India witnessed a 29 per cent capacity reduction, with capacity falling 2,077,578 as compared to originally-planned.  ICAO estimates also show that international capacity globally could drop by as much as two-thirds from what had been forecast for the first three quarters this year, leading airline revenues to drop by as much 160 to 253 billion dollars for the January to September period.It said Europe and the Asia-Pacific will be hardest hit by the capacity and revenue impacts, followed by North America.Similarly, the most substantial reduction in passenger numbers is expected to be in Europe, especially during its peak summer travel season, followed by the Asia-Pacific."As overall severity and duration of the pandemic are still uncertain, ICAO has developed six different recovery paths under two indicative scenarios to explore the potential short-term economic implication of the COVID-19 pandemic,” ICAO Secretary General Fang Liu said.The agency said that prior to the outbreak, airlines had planned to increase seat capacity by 4.2 per cent for the first 9 months of 2020, compared to the same period of 2019.According to the latest estimates, passenger seat capacity could instead drop anywhere between 41 per cent and 67 per cent.Given the originally planned seat capacity, passenger demand could have increased 64 million for the first 9 months of 2020, compared to the same period of 2019.However, passenger demand could now drop by 705 million-1,177 million depending on whether the first sign of recovery appears in late May or in the third quarter of the year and later.With the originally planned seat capacity and trend line growth of demand, airlines' gross passenger operating revenues could have increased USD 15 billion for the first 9 months of 2020, compared to the same period of 2019.However, according to the latest estimates, airlines' revenues could instead plummet USD 160 to 218 billion if the first sign of recovery comes in late May and USD 218 to 253 billion if recovery restarts in the third quarter.Over two-thirds of revenue loss would be recorded by Asia/Pacific and Europe.

This was followed by Caribbeans as the second-largest ethnic group affected in the Covid-19 death toll at 2.9 per cent (407 death), followed by Pakistanis at 2.1 per cent (287 deaths).The data, only a limited snapshot of the UK-wide Covid-19 fatalities from the deadly virus, follows the British government’s announcement of a review into the coronavirus death toll disparity among the BAME population.“We have seen, both across the population as a whole but in those who work in the NHS, a much higher proportion who’ve died from minority backgrounds and that really worries me,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock while launching the review last week. The proportion of deaths among BAME groups is much higher compared to their roughly 13 per cent make-up of the total population.“The government must take every necessary step to address this devastating disparity and protect all sectors of the population equally and now,” said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, Council Chair of the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union lobbying for the review. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pios-worst-hit-by-virus-in-uk-75391
24-04-2020||---||Stigma behind higher mortality: AIIMS chief||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 23AIIMS, New Delhi, Director Randeep Guleria, one of the top leaders of India’s Covid-19 response, today said stigma against carriers of the disease and the infected was causing higher mortality by deterring people from coming forward for early testing and care.“Covid-19 is not that serious. Around 90 to 95 per cent people will recover with supportive treatment and oxygen therapy, but due to delay by symptomatic people in seeking treatment we are seeing higher mortality. If they come early they will recover through early medical care but if they come late when they are already gasping for breath there will be higher mortality,” Guleria said adding that several Indian hospitals had started using convalescent plasma therapy as a treatment option for Covid patients and many of the cured have voluntarily donated their plasma for others. The therapy involves administering antibody rich plasma of cured Covid patients to those still fighting the disease. “We are already looking at other drug options, including hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, some repurposed drugs and some newer drugs,” said Guleria asking everyone to treat the carriers of Covid as symbols of hope and victory rather than stigmatise them.‘People reluctant to seek medical help’Because of the stigma many people with flu-like symptoms are not coming forward to facilities. They are coming very late, leading to higher mortality. — Randeep Guleria, AIIMS-Delhi DirectorHe urged everyone to encourage symptomatic people to seek early medical care and get tested early.He said since 80 per cent people will have mild illness and 15 per cent will need oxygen support to recover, India’s strategy going forward is to increase the number of hospital beds with oxygen support.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stigma-behind-higher-mortality-aiims-chief-75386

The virus does not discriminate on the basis of caste, creed, religion or gender,” the CWC said, days after two Sadhus and their driver were killed in a mob lynching incident in Maharashtra’s Palghar triggering a war of words between the BJP and the Congress and the Government spoke of Delhi’s Nizamuddin cluster making up 30 per cent of all COVID cases in India.After detailed deliberations today the CWC demanded the utilisation of the remaining lockdown period for the preparation and publication of a detailed exit strategy and a comprehensive roadmap; substantial increase in health infrastructure and measures to revive the economy and protect current levels of employment and wages.In specific recommendations to the government the CWC asked for a policy under which migrant workers who wished to return home could be allowed under strict conditions of health safety and provided money and food in the interim.Former PM Manmohan Singh while addressing the virtual CWC called for active cooperation between the Centre and the states while former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi termed migrant labour issues as a priority demanding a proper lockdown exit plan.‘Centre not releasing dues, kits’Don’t indulge in cheap politics: BJPAccusing the Congress of deliberately trying to create divisions in the society, the BJP on Thursday asked the opposition party not to practice "cheap and small politics" but come together with the Union government in fighting the outbreak||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reveal-exit-plan-cong-to-govt-75383
24-04-2020||Nonika Singh||Theatre was her calling & mission||On stage or off it, her enthusiasm was palpable and infectious. Renowned theatre person Usha Ganguly’s dynamic visual vocabulary set the stage on fire and embellished many a thought-provoking productions.She breathed her last on Thursday. It’s not only Kolkata where she lived that would miss her robust and feisty presence, but also Chandigarh. A regular in the city, she staged many a play, including Anhi Mai Da Sufna, based on Partition. She took pride in being political and her plays invariably delved into socio-economic concerns.From expose of vestigial religious practices to caste system to drug addiction to woman’s repression, her subjects centred on her concern for humanity. A former Hindi professor, self-trained in theatre, this trained bharatnatyam dancer used her dance experience to illuminate her plays with a unique visual language. A perfectionist to the core is how theatre person Sahib Singh recalls her. A one woman army, she designed as well as wrote plays that often took inspiration from the works of literary giants such as Tagore and Manto.If her play Chandalika was based on Tagore’s story, his four writings were the inspiration behind her Bengali play Manushi. Though she created space for Hindi theatre in the Bengal heartland, she rightly believed that theatre has its own language. No wonder, her plays in Hindi found a resonance across continents and in countries like Germany. A Sangeet Natak Akademi awardee, she served as Akademi’s executive committee member, member of the National School of Drama, Satyajit Ray Film Institute et al.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/theatre-was-her-calling-mission-75378
