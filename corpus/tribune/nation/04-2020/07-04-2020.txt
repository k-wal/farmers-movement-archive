The letter, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, asks companies to remove users who are spreading misinformation and “preserve” their details for sharing with law enforcement when requested.“You need to ensure that such rogue messages do not go viral,” said the IT ministry’s letter.“(Such messages) have the potential for creating panic... this effectively weakens the all-out effort being made by the Indian government for containing the coronavirus,” the letter added.In a statement, TikTok said it was “actively working with the government to support” their efforts to fight misinformation, while proactively working towards elevating credible information related to COVID-19 on its platform.Facebook told Reuters it was taking “aggressive steps to stop misinformation and harmful content from spreading on our platforms”. It said it will remove misinformation about COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, that could contribute to imminent physical harm.‘Infodemic’The coronavirus crisis has been accompanied by what the World Health Organization has called an “infodemic” of misinformation. Globally, platforms such as Facebook have responded by barring users from posting misleading information about the coronavirus, including denials of expert guidance and encouragement of fake treatments.India has reported over 4,000 coronavirus cases and 117 deaths, and is in lockdown nationwide. The government has been issuing Twitter posts cautioning people against misinformation and debunking fake news.Uttar Pradesh also raised concerns about “fake news” social media posts on Tuesday, saying its cyber cell was reviewing at least one Facebook and six TikTok videos. It gave no further details.“We will definitely take action ... We are also sending details to the Indian government from our end,” a senior state official, Avanish Kumar Awasthi, told reporters.

07-04-2020||New Delhi||Gehlot favours phased withdrawal of lockdown, says saving lives is important||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday favoured a phased withdrawal of the lockdown, saying it cannot be done immediately after the 21-day period ends.Addressing a press conference through video conferencing, he said saving lives is important and no step should be taken that would endanger lives.“We cannot withdraw lockdown immediately. It has to be done in a phased manner, that is what I feel,” Gehlot said when asked about the right time to lift the countrywide lockdown over coronavirus.He said though a 21-day lockdown is a long time, saving lives is very important and the issue needs to be taken very seriously.“We should not take such a step immediately which would endanger lives,” he said.Gehlot said it will depend on what step the Central government takes and that will be known only on April 14.“We feel that the Centre and the states are jointly making a plan after communicating with each other, as every state is in a different situation on the state of virus spread and number of cases.“We feel the lockdown should be lifted in such a way that people do not face inconvenience and it should not be imposed again and again, as containing the virus is a big challenge before us,” he noted.Gehlot said a decision on withdrawing the lockdown in Rajasthan will, however, be taken after the recommendations of a task force set up in this regard are received.He said the state government has set up two separate task forces on how to open the lockdown and how to improve the state of the economy and bring it back on track.The chief minister said Rajasthan has showed the way on how to contain the spread of the virus by its steps in Bhilwara, which had become a hotspot of the virus, and the same model will be replicated across the state, including in Ramganj, Jaipur.He claimed that the state authorities reached out to six lakh households in Bhilwara and conducted widespread testing there.Gehlot also said Rajasthan will start rapid testing of coronavirus in the state within a week as his government has ordered 10 lakh testing kits from China which will be received soon.He said Rajasthan is among those states which had taken the virus threat seriously and after holding extensive consultations with various stakeholders, the state prepared itself well and has been successful in containing it so far.Gehlot also demanded a probe by a sitting or retired judge of the Supreme Court into the Tablighi Jamaat incident, which saw the spread of virus across the country.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also said the party was not against action against Tablighi Jamaat in Nizamuddin if they violated any rules or norms.

In December last year, the court did not quash the FIR but stayed the arrest. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-hc-quashes-fir-against-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-66970

Physical Activity is a must if the body and mind are to be kept healthy.“With this view in mind, the course on Physical Activity Trainer has been prepared. It will not only help in developing the skill of a trainer, but will also become a life skill as it will imbibe the idea of keeping fit for life,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-to-introduce-3-new-subjects-for-class-11-from-2020-21-session-66966

Poor quality onions were around Rs 200 per quintal,” says Bhise.According to officials of the APMC, onion arrival at Lasalgaon was around 2000 tonnes till late afternoon today.Information available from the market is that the Nashik region has reported a bumper onion crop this year.Exporters who stock up on the bulb for the global markets are absent due to the absence of international flights following the coronavirus pandemic.The fall in wholesale prices has not helped the end customers.

While the UK government is helping international students and is ensuring that they are not evicted from university accommodations, those who live in private apartments are in many cases not being able to pay rents or afford basic sustenance,” the petitioner submitted.Mridul sought to highlight the worsening condition in the UK and suspension of all international flights. Since March 23, India too has banned all international flights since March 23 till April 14. Many Indian students who had booked tickets can’t fly to India and remained stranded in the UK due to this ban.“India is probably the only country that has imposed an embargo on the return of its own citizens, and where other countries are making all possible efforts to repatriate their citizens stranded in various countries, India with its travel bans has made it impossible for its own citizens to come back home,” the petitioner submitted.The plea brings to the light the greater risk of contracting COVID-19 that the Indian students were at greater risk of being exposed to COVID-19 as they were crammed into packed hostels with shared kitchens and bathroom facilities, the petitioner said, adding many of them were running out of finances and facing shortage of food and water.“They have not been able to access any protective masks, gloves or sanitizers and are worried about contracting the deadly virus while miles away from their loved ones in India,” the petitioner submitted.A blanket order preventing Indian citizens from returning back home was arbitrary and violated their right to life and liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, the petitioner submitted.She said till the evacuation takes place, it must be ensured that the Indian students’ needs were taken care of.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-plea-seeking-evacuation-of-indian-students-stranded-in-uk-66954

Owing to peace and tranquility existing in the region and the bonhomie that has developed between both the border guarding forces, Singkam was handed over to the Indian Army on Tuesday, he said.This has provided immense relief to the family members of Singkam and also to the people of the area, he said.Singkam has been quarantined by the Indian Army and will be handed over to his family after 14 days, the official said.Singkam along with his two friends -- Gamshi Chadar and Ronya Nade -- had gone fishing and to collect traditional herbs from the land belonging to the Naa clan of Tagin community on March 19 when the Chinese security personnel allegedly ambushed them.While his other two friends could successfully escape, Singkam was abducted at gunpoint by the Chinese security personnel.The Tagin Cultural Society had approached the governor on March 27, urging him to take steps for Singkam's release.A complaint was also filed by Singkam's family at the Nacho police station on March 23.The McMahon Line demarcates the boundary between the Tibet autonomous region of China and Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing claims as its own.The McMahon Line is not properly demarcated and small cement pillars erected on the Indian side often get covered under wild growth.A number of organisations in the state had appealed to the state government for taking up the matter with the Centre for the safe release of the man.The Siyum Nacho Limeking Taksing Students Union (SNLTSU) had also threatened to launch a democratic movement in the state capital, if his early and safe release was not ensured.

This inevitably results in large numbers of different species being held nearby, causing immense stress and weakening of their immune systems, they added.The letter comes at the time when the world is reeling under the outbreak of COVID-19, which is believed to have originated in a wildlife market in Wuhan.Signed by more than 200 organisations, including World Animal Protection, International Fund for Animal Welfare, Humane Society International, Born Free and Wild Aid, the letter highlights the suspected COVID-19 link to a wildlife market in China.The WHO must take action to achieve its mission to serve public health at all times by recommending that governments worldwide permanently ban live wildlife markets and the use of wildlife in traditional medicine, the letter says.  These actions would help protect human life from future pandemics such as COVID-19, it adds.Sixty per cent of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, meaning they originate from animals, with 70% of this is thought to originate from wild animals.  “While a robust global response is critical in detecting, treating and reducing transmission [of COVID-19], it is equally necessary to take vital measures to prevent similar emerging infectious diseases developing into pandemics with the associated threats to human life, and social and economic well-being, “ the letter states.According to Gajender K Sharma, Country Director of World Animal Protection, India: “The World Health Organisation must be commended for its efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. It is believed that this pandemic originated at a wildlife market, hence we are calling on WHO to unequivocally state the proven link between these markets and the serious threats they can cause to human health.“WHO can help prevent future pandemics by excluding the use of wildlife from their endorsement of traditional medicine. This could help save lives in the future and help protect millions of wild animals that are unnecessarily and cruelly farmed or poached from the wild to supply this industry. Plant-based alternatives are recognised and available,” he said The organisations want WHO to:||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-more-than-200-organisations-write-to-who-seek-support-for-ban-on-wildlife-trade-66945

Bigger than board exams now is this exam of patience." Gagandeep Singh, who lives in Gokalpuri area, said, "I think I will remember how disturbed I was during my class 10 exams all my life. The stress of exams and scoring well seems immaterial now, when we are facing riots and global pandemic."In February, the northeast part of the national capital was rocked by violence in which 53 people were killed and over 200 injured. The areas worst affected in the violence included Jaffrabad, Maujpur, Chand Bagh, Khureji Khas and Bhajanpura.In view of the violence, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had postponed exams at over 80 centres in northeast Delhi area till February 29.The exams were, however, conducted as per original schedule from March 2 onwards as board officials opined that any further delay in conducting exams will affect the students' prospects in undergraduate admissions.The board had announced a fresh schedule, according to which class 12 exams in the area were supposed to begin on March 31 and conclude on April 14, while exams for class 10 were scheduled from March 21 to March 30.However, the exams had to be again postponed in view of the coronavirus outbreak its resultant 21-day nationwide lockdown.According to board officials, students will be given a 10-day notice before exams are conducted when the lockdown is lifted.The death toll due to novel coronavirus rose to 114 and the number of cases in the country climbed to 4,421 on Tuesday, according to the Union Health Ministry.

We don't want to interfere with government decisions for the next 10-15 days," it said.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta -- who had on Friday said that PIL shops must close down -- contended that except vague assertions there were no facts in the petition.As the Bench asked Bhushan to respond to the status report filed by the government by Monday, the activist lawyer said, "By Monday many people will die. Those registered with the government should be given some money to send to their families back home."Asking the petitioners to respond to the government's status report, the Bench posted the matter for further hearing on April 13.The Supreme Court had on Friday asked the Centre to respond to a PIL seeking directions to ensure payments of wages/minimum  wages to migrant workers employed  by some establishments/contractors  or  those self-employed as they  were  unable  to  work and earn wages due to nationwide lockdown in view of COVID-19 pandemic.A Bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao had issued notice to the Centre on a PIL filed by activist Anjali Bhardwaj and Harsh Mander, the top court expressed concern over the plight of migrant workers in the unorganised sector and asked the Centre to file its response by April 7.During hearing of another PIL, the Centre had earlier told the top court that more than 21,000 temporary shelters had been set up where close to seven lakh migrant workers had been accommodated across India and they were being given food and medical facilities.The petitioners had also sought directions to the  central  and  state  governments  to  immediately  activate National  and  State  Advisory  Committees  of  experts  in  the  field  of disaster  management  and  public  health  and  prepare  national  and state  disaster  management  plans  for  dealing  with  COVID-19.The plan should be prepared taking into  account  all  relevant  aspects,  mitigation measures, state  disaster  management  plans  for  dealing  with  the  pandemic,  besides mitigation measures, their  possible  costs  and  consequences  required under  the Disaster  Management  Act,  2005.The order imposing a nationwide lockdown led to  loss  of  jobs  and  employment of  lakhs of migrant workers as a result of which they  were faced with shortage of money,  food  and  shelter  and  were forced to march  back  to  their  homes, the petitioners said, adding, it made a mockery  of  the  rnorms  of  social  distancing.  The  lockdown order for  which  no  prior  intimation  was  given,  created  a  panic across  the  country  and  led  to  the  instantaneous  loss  of  jobs  and  wages  of millions  of  migrant  workers  employed  in  establishments  across  India  or  self-employed  as  street  vendors,  rickshaw  pullers,  domestic  house  helps,  petty job  workers,  etc, the petitioners submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-pass-order-for-payment-of-wages-to-migrant-workers-during-lockdown-66933
07-04-2020||---||Health concern rather than economy should determine lockdown exit strategy: Naidu||New Delhi, April 7As the 21-day lockdown period enters its third week, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday stressed that primacy to concerns over health should determine the exit strategy and revival of economy could be pursued in due course."Between the considerations of the health of the people and stabilization of our economy being debated, the former shall take precedence over the later. In my view, while the concerns of economy can wait for another day, that of health can't,” he said urging people to abide by any decision the leadership takes in this regard.In a statement, Naidu said the next seven days would be critical for deciding on the exit from the present nation-wide restrictions in force from March 25 with data on the extent and rate of spread of virus infection having a bearing on exit strategy.Referring to the consultations between the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers on the exit strategy, he said people should abide by whatever decision follows and cooperate with the same spirit that has so far been demonstrated even if hardship were to continue after April 14.He expected that governments will ensure smooth functioning of supply chains and adequate relief and support for the vulnerable sections.Alluding to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in the national capital and its fallout when the efforts for flattening the coronavirus curve were bearing fruit, Naidu said it was an avoidable aberration and an eye-opener for others.The Vice President urged the global community to draw right lessons from the present crisis to effectively face the next imminent one by addressing the inadequacies in respect of effectiveness of institutions, information sharing, international cooperation and individual actions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/health-concern-rather-than-economy-should-determine-lockdown-exit-strategy-naidu-66929

There is no urgent requirement that cannot be postponed until this crisis is contained. This sum could instead be allocated towards constructing new hospital infrastructure and diagnostics along with equipping our frontline workers with Personal Protection Equipment and better facilities, she said.Congress chief also said the PM should order a proportionate reduction of 30 per cent in the expenditure budget (other than salaries, pensions and central sector schemes) for the Government of India as well.This would save the government Rs 2.5 lakh crores per year approximately.“Money saved can then be allocated towards establishing an economic safety net for migrant workers, labourers, farmers, MSMEs and those in the unorganised sector, Gandhi suggested. She said all foreign visits, including that of the President, the Prime Minister, Union Ministers, Chief Ministers, State Ministers and Bureaucrats must be put on hold in a similar fashion with exceptions in case of special emergency.This, she said, would bring money as Rs 393 crores were spent for just the Prime Minister and Union Cabinet’s trips in the last five years.Lastly, she asked all the money of PM Cares’ fund should be transferred to the Prime Ministers National Relief Fund for transparency and efficient use.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-to-pm-suspend-central-vista-plan-ban-govt-ads-for-2-years-66928

It is submitted that the Impugned Order would lead to grave consequences for the people of the adjoining districts in the State of Karnataka,” it had contended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-to-allow-emergency-patients-from-kerala-to-reach-mangaluru-hospitals-66925

It said the decision to recommence exports of 13 APIs was based on a comfortable stock position. HCQ  and paracetamol were shifted from the restricted to the licensed list (meaning case-by-case clearance) after balancing the domestic stock position with India’s obligation to supply it to nations badly affected by the pandemic, said the Ministry of External Affairs.Not just Trump but several world leaders in phone calls to Modi had requested India for reconsideration, especially on releasing shipments previously contracted by US companies.The MEA also indicated that apart from fulfilling previous contract obligations and meeting personal requests from world leaders, India will accord top priority to sending paracetamol and HCQ to neighbouring countries that are “dependent on Indian capabilities”, thus indicating that Pakistan may not make the cut.Further rationalising the decision to allow limited exports of HCQ and paracetamol, the MEA said India had always maintained that the international community must display strong solidarity and cooperation.MEA spokesperson Anurag Shrivastava said the March 3 order banning the export of over a dozen drugs and the reversal was actually a temporary step as part of the obligation of “any responsible government” to ensure that there are adequate domestic stocks of medicines. Subsequently, the curbs were largely lifted after an assessment confirmed the availability of medicines for all possible contingencies, he maintained while asking that the issue should not be politicised. Other sources agreed and said apart from paracetmol, most of these are not directly connected with the treatment of Covid. The API and formulations on which export restrictions were lifted are primarily made in Hubei province, the COVID-19 epicentre, whose lockdown prompted the government to impose export restrictions in March to conserve stocks for domestic deployment. The fear of shortages receded after Chinese pharma companies got back on track towards the beginning of this month.The APIs and medicines on which export restrictions have now been lifted include Vitamin B1, B6, B12 and their formulations; progesterone and its formulations plus antibiotic APIs like erythromycin salts, Tinidazole, Neomycin and drugs manufactured using these.The restrictions were placed after an assessment which warned that the stock-in hand of APIs may be sufficient for two to three months to manufacture formulations.In India, the main API makers for HCQ are Ipca Laboratories and Zydus Cadila and the US is now ready to overlook a three-year ban by the US Federal Drug Authority on one of the companies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-trump-warning-india-allows-export-of-covid-cure-drug-to-us-66911

He may have some problem (admitting to it) because the system in his country does not give recognition to Ayurveda. He may have felt he would violate rules, which is why his refusal to admit is obvious," Naik told a local cable news channel in an interview late on Monday."I believe 101 per cent, that he has been cured (using Ayurveda and Homeopathy)," Naik also said.On April 2, Naik had told a press conference in Goa, that Prince Charles had been cured of COVID-19 after seeking treatment from a Bengaluru-based alternative treatment resort, SOUKYA International Holistic Health Centre' run by a doctor Isaac Mathai.A day after his statement, Clarence House, the official residence of Prince Charles had said that the claim was incorrect, and that the royal "followed the medical advice of the National Health Service in the UK and nothing more". The royal had been diagnosed COVID-19 positive last month.Naik in the cable TV interview on Monday, continued to insist that Ayurveda and Homeopathy had indeed cured the Prince and that it was a "victory" for Indian traditional medicine systems. Naik also said that there was no need to disbelieve the doctor Isaac Mathai, who cured Prince Charles."The man (Dr. Mathai) himself is saying this. He is a doctor, an owner of a resort, he is trustworthy, when he says this, it is a victory of our Indian system," Naik said.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prince-charles-cured-by-ayurveda-homoeopathy-minister-66905

India has said that it is reviewing its export ban order.Notably, India's decision to ban the exports of Hydroxychloroquine is driven by its desire to take stock of the domestic requirements and ensure that the country has enough in its kitty.Reiterating that for many years, India has been taking advantage of the US on trade, Trump said that he would be surprised if New Delhi was to stop export of Hydroxychloroquine to the US."So, I would be surprised if that were his decision. He'd have to tell me that. I spoke to him Sunday morning, called him, and I said we'd appreciate your allowing our supply to come out. If he doesn't allow it to come out, that would be okay, but of course there may be retaliation. Why wouldn't there be?" Trump said.His remarks came at a time when both countries are in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recommended the anti-malarial drug for those involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus and also, for the asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.On Monday, a senior State Department official said that India has been a significant partner of the US in the pharmaceutical sector and it expects similar cooperation to continue between the economies. “India has long been a significant partner of the United States in the pharmaceutical sector,” Alice G Wells, the Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, told reporters during a press briefing.The Trump administration has already created a national strategic stockpile of 29 million doses of the malaria drug, anticipating that its test results on more than 1,500 COVID-19 patients in New York is yielding positive results.Global scientists, racing against time to find either a vaccine or a therapeutic cure to the virus, have begun testing Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as candidates for potential COVID-19 treatments and the FDA last week issued an Emergency Use Authorization for the prescription of the drugs in certain circumstances.In addition to New York, COVID-19 patients in several States are being treated with Hydroxychloroquine, including Michigan and Texas.Based on some initial results, the Trump administration is banking heavily on using Hydroxychloroquine for the successful treatment of coronavirus.According to Trump, the drug is yielding positive results. If successful, he told reporters that it would be a gift from heaven.

It has been only three times in the post-Independent India that the Sangh could not hold the important event, which is part of its annual calendar.Lauding the response of the Narendra Modi government to the Covid crisis, the ruling BJP’s ideological fountainhead also called the steps taken by country’s leadership an example for “so-called developed” nations.Addressing the media via videoconferencing, Sangh leader Manmohan Vaidya launched an attack on the Tablighi Jamaat, saying the Nizamuddin congregation was responsible for close to 30 per cent of the active Covid cases in the country. He said Tablighi leaders did not show a responsible behaviour and the “way some of them later behaved with people was a show of ‘vikruti’ (abnormality) of minds”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-suspends-annual-training-event-for-1st-time-66707

Coupled with job losses, Giterres recognised that the lockdown has trapped women with abusive partners while healthcare providers and the police are overwhelmed and understaffed.“Violence is not confined to the battlefield. For many women and girls, the threat looms largest where they should be safest. In their own homes. And so I make a new appealfor peace at home — and in homes — around the world,” said the UN Secretary-General.Over the past weeks as economic and social pressures and fear have grown, there has been a global surge in domestic violence. In some countries, the number of women calling support services has doubled.Guterres suggested setting up emergency warning systems in pharmacies and groceries, declaring shelters as essential services and creating safe ways for women to seek support, without alerting their abusers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/global-surge-in-domestic-violence-post-lockdown-66703

Persons are usually quarantined in their homes, but they may also be quarantined in community-based facilities. The quarantine period is 14 days,” the guidelines said.The guidelines detail all aspects of the process which is key to Covid-19 containment.“Examples of quarantine application include the closing of local or community borders or erection of a barrier around a geographic area (cordon sanitaire) with strict enforcement to prohibit movement into and out of the area,” the guidelines say, explaining how to set up quarantine facilities during the current Covid-19 outbreak.“The recommended duration of quarantine for Covid-19 based on available information is up to 14 days from the time of exposure. The purpose of quarantine during the current outbreak is to reduce transmission by separating contacts of Covid-19 patients from community; monitoring contacts for development of sign and symptoms of Covid-19 and segregation of Covid-19 suspects as early as possible from among other quarantined persons,” the government guidance says.The document covers procedures required for physical infrastructure and guides states on how to disinfect quarantine facilities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/recent-travellers-persons-exposed-to-gatherings-can-be-quarantined-govt-66702

Those who were quarantined in the hostel were moved to the Covid ward,” UNA and another representative organisation Jan Swasthya Abhiyan said in a joint statement.According to the nurses’ body, two nurses attending to the patient who was diagnosed with Covid-19 first tested positive. Subsequently, other personnel in the hospital also tested positive. At least two nurses have been admitted to other hospitals in a critical condition, according to the UNA.BMC officials, however, maintained that only 29 people have tested positive for the virus. However, several more people have been tested and their reports were yet to be received, the civic body said. The 26 nurses and the three doctors who tested positive were moved out of Wockhardt Hospital and admitted to various places across Mumbai.Wockhard Hospital has now been declared a “containment zone” with no one allowed to enter or exit the premises.

In fact, India has even stopped the export of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) which is said to help patients fight Covid infection.Apart from Trump who said he would appreciate it if India released the amounts US companies have ordered, Israel President Benjamin Netanyahu made a direct reference to India’s export ban by hoping it would improve pharmaceutical supplies. Other world leaders in their conversations with PM Modi are understood to have couched the need to keep global supply chains of anti-Covid going in indirect language.India has already permitted the use of hydroxychloroquine for medical and healthcare workers treating Covid patients and that is why it wants to preserve enough stocks of the drug to deal with a surge that has been predicted in the coming week.India had cancelled the exports on the plea that most of the Indian formulation makers are dependent on Chinese manufactures but this plea is no longer valid after Beijing reported that its plants are back to the original production levels.In India, the main API makers for this drug are Ipca Laboratories and Zydus Cadila and in its desperation to source the drug, the US has reportedly informed India that it will be willing to overlook a three-year ban by the US Federal Drug Authority in case of one of the companies.The FDA has approved the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine with the approval at the urging of Trump after a few studies showed a correlation between its application and the improved health of some patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-in-a-fix-over-export-request-for-anti-malaria-drug-66698

Who gave the approval (for the congregation to take place)?” Pawar asked.The veteran leader revealed that the administration was pro-active in cracking down on large gatherings across the state. “The Solapur district authorities booked people who were going to attend a bull and horse race at a village in the district. Thousands of people had gathered. If the Delhi administration was alert enough, the unfortunate situation would not have arisen,” Pawar said.He further pointed out that media reports on the congregation were taking communal overtones. “Why is it so necessary for the media to play this up? It is targeting one community unnecessarily,” Pawar said.The NCP chief also added that the Central government should give a financial package for Maharashtra as the state’s economy was worst hit by the lockdown.He expressed concern over fake and misleading messages related to coronavirus circulating on social media.The NCP chief also asked people to maintain a “scientific temperament” during the lockdown and follow social distancing to contain the spread of coronavirus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-gave-permission-for-jamaat-event-asks-pawar-66696

Along with the domestic supply of 20,000 coveralls, 1.90 lakh coveralls will now be distributed to hospitals. PTIThe government’s first analysis of gender, age and mortality trends of the viral disease progression in the country shows 76 per cent of all current 4,281 cases and 73 per cent of all 111 deaths as of today involve men.Women represent 24 per cent of the national case load and 27 per cent of the overall mortality, indicating lesser vulnerability.Between Stage 2 and 3India is between Stage 2 and 3 of pandemic, the Health Ministry said on Monday, concurring with AIIMS Director’s remarks that localised community transmission is being observed in some pockets of the country. PTICovid cases, meanwhile, continued to rise through Monday as these reached 4,281, marking a record single-day increase of 907 cases.Deaths rose by record 32 to 111, from 79 on Sunday afternoon, representing the highest single-day rise in mortality since the outbreak in the country on January 30. In positive news, 318 persons have been cured and discharged.Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said 47 per cent of all infections in the country had happened in people below 40.“Around 34 per cent of cases involve 40 to 60 year olds and 19 per cent are in the age segment above 60 years. On mortality, 63 per cent deaths are in 60 plus people; 30 per cent in 40 to 60 year olds and seven per cent in persons below 40 years,” said Agarwal.A key determinant of mortality in Covid cases — for old and young alike — is the presence of comorbid conditions. Data analysis shows in 86 per cent of all deaths, people have had underlying disease burden of diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease or heart conditions.“The elderly account for 19 per cent of all cases but 63 cent of all deaths. Even among the young who have died, the presence of pre-existing diseases was seen. Youngsters with comorbid conditions must maintain social distance within their houses to ensure the elders are not infected,” Agarwal warned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/half-of-infected-under-40-years-govt-66690
