27-04-2020||New Delhi||10 Tablighi Jamaat members who recovered from COVID-19 donate their plasma||Ten members of Tablighi Jamaat, who attended its congregation and tested positive for COVID-19 have come forward and donated their plasma to treat severally-ill coronavirus patients in the national capital.Sources said those who have come forward to donate their plasma have recovered from COVID-19 at the Sultanpuri and Narela quarantine centres.Many more have volunteered to donate their plasma, they added.The Tablighi Jamaat, a religious organisation in south Delhi’s Nizamuddin came under intense attack for the spread of coronavirus after it allegedly organised a congregation after the lockdown and even when the Delhi government had imposed curbs before it.In the therapy, transfusion of plasma from recovered patients to severally-ill COVID-19 patients is conducted. Convalescent plasma is an experimental procedure for coronavirus patients.Sources said several Tablighi Jamaat members at different quarantine centres have also volunteered to donate their plasma for the recovery of COVID-19 patients.The move comes after an appeal was made by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal last week to patients, who have successfully recovered from coronavirus, to donate their plasma for treatment of COVID-19 patients.Kejriwal said the initial results of plasma therapy on critically-ill COVID-19 patients have shown “encouraging” initial results.Last week, Tablighi Jamaat head Maluana Saad Kandhalvi also appealed to the organisation’s followers who have recovered from the infection to donate their plasma.  A Delhi government official said the process of taking plasma from the Tablighi Jamaat members has started.According to Dr Mohammad Shoaib, who is facilitating the exercise, till now, 10 Tablighi Jamaat members have donated their plasma to help other coronavirus patients. Shoaib said he is not related to the Tablighi Jamaat, but he is acquainted with its followers. He also claimed that the Delhi government requested him to involve Tablighi Jamaat followers to donate plasma.The exercise commenced on Sunday evening after the iftar at Sultanpuri and Narela quarantine centres following which a team from the Delhi government’s ILBS Hospital and another private hospital visited the premises, he said.The Tablighi Jamaat congregation which took place in March was attended by nearly 9,000 people, including foreign nationals.After that hundreds of Tablighi Jamaat followers were quarantined at different centres and many were booked for alleged misbehaviour with the staff there.On April 18, at a daily media briefing about the COVID-19 situation in the country, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health, said, “A total of 4,291 COVID-19 cases or 29.8 per cent of the 14,378 coronavirus infections reported till that day were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation.”According to the bulletin released by the Health Department of the Delhi government, on April 10, when the total number of COVID-19 cases were 903 in Delhi, 584 infections were linked to the Tablighi congregation.Since then the Delhi government dropped usage of the “markaz”, the centre of the Tablighi Jamaat after the Delhi Minorities Commission raised an objection over it. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/10-tablighi-jamaat-members-who-recovered-from-covid-19-donate-their-plasma-77093
27-04-2020||Lucknow||Kanika Kapoor offers to donate plasma for treating COVID-19 patients||Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor on Monday expressed her desire to donate her plasma for treating coronavirus patients, officials said.She has given her blood sample for testing at the King George’s Medical University (KGMU) here, they said. “Singer Kanika Kapoor on Monday expressed her desire to KGMU doctors to donate plasma. After this, she was called and her blood sample was taken for testing. If everything is found appropriate in the report (of the blood test), she will be called on Monday evening or Tuesday to donate her plasma,” Tulika Chandra, Head of Department of Transfusion Medicine, KGMU told PTI. “So far, three COVID-19 patients, who have recovered from the infection at the KGMU, have donated their plasma. This includes a resident doctor of KGMU Tauseef Khan, a female doctor from Canada (who was admitted here) and another patient,” she said.Kapoor had tested positive for novel coronavirus on March 20.She came under attack for negligence and not practising self-quarantine despite returning to the country from the UK amid the coronavirus pandemic.In a statement on Sunday, the singer said she is aware of “several versions of stories” about her diagnosis, but “negativity thrown at a person does not change the reality”.The singer clarified that she travelled to Lucknow to meet her family on March 11 and claimed there was “no screening setup for domestic flights”.On March 14 and 15, Kapoor said she attended a friend’s lunch and dinner and clarified “there was no party hosted by me and I was in absolute normal health”.However, on March 17 and 18, she developed symptoms and said she got herself tested on March 19.“On March 20 when informed that my test was positive, I chose to go to the hospital. I was discharged after three negative tests and have since been at home for 21 days,” she added.Meanwhile, a 58-year-old doctor became the first coronavirus patient at the KGMU here to receive plasma therapy as an experimental treatment for the disease on Monday, a hospital official said.The doctor from Orai in Uttar Pradesh was administered the plasma donated by the woman doctor from Canada who was the first COVID-19 patient admitted to the KGMU and later recovered, Chandra said.Convalescent Plasma Therapy is an experimental procedure for COVID-19 patients. In this treatment, plasma (a blood component) from a cured COVID-19 patient is transfused to a critically ill coronavirus patient.The blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 develops antibodies to battle against the virus.The idea behind the therapy is that immunity can be transferred from a healthy person to a sick patient using convalescent plasma. Once the blood plasma of the recovered patient is infused with that of the second patient, the antibodies start fighting against coronavirus in the second person’s body.The process of donating plasma is similar to that of donating blood and takes about an hour.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had recently asked the state’s medical authorities to promote plasma therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients after examining its efficacy.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recently allowed states to start clinical trials of plasma therapy. Many states like Kerala, Gujarat and Punjab have already started using it for treatment of coronavirus patients.Several other countries including the United Kingdom and the United States have also started plasma therapy trials.

The SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in the human test sample binds to the antigens and the reaction is then analysed through scientific processes to determine the presence of the virus.The other technology is the “reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification,” which scientists say, is a new generation innovative procedure that detects genomic viral RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) in human samples.DRDO has listed over 43 items designed and developed by it that can be adapted or modified for use in the fight against COVID-19 and are open for manufacture by the private industry. These include personal protection gear, virus detection and neutralisation items, shelters, sanitisers and safety gadgets and medical equipment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drdo-adapts-two-more-bio-warfare-technologies-to-fight-covid-19-77080

Out of these, 102 patients have died.An analysis of the data shows that the COVID-19 death rate in the city is 4.71 per cent, higher than that in New Delhi and Mumbai and the national average.In Delhi, 54 coronavirus patients out of the total 2,919 cases have died so far, which indicates the death rate of 1.85 per cent.In Mumbai, the death rate is 3.77 per cent, as so far 204 patients out of the total 5,407 cases have succumbed to the disease.Besides, total 26,917 coronavirus cases have been reported in the country.

27-04-2020||New Delhi||No loss to government as rapid kit order from Chinese firms cancelled, says ICMR||The Indian Council of Medical Research said on Monday it had cancelled the rapid test kit procurement tender floated earlier through an Indian importer of the Chinese kits after the equipment was found faulty in field tests and asked states to send them back to the suppliers.In an advisory sent to chief secretaries of all states and Union Territories on Monday, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said it "evaluated the kits of Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech and Zhuhai Livson Diagnostics in field conditions. The results have shown wide variation in their sensitivity, despite early promise of good performance for surveillance purpose"."In view of this, states are advised to stop using these kits, procured from the above mentioned companies and return them to be sent back to the suppliers," it said. The health ministry on its part issued a statement saying that after receipt of some supplies, ICMR has conducted quality checks on these kits in field conditions.In its advisory, the ICMR said that several states have procured rapid  antibody test kits and on their demand the ICMR also provided these kits with clear instructions that they are to be used only for surveillance purpose.Some states have raised issues regarding their performance during the testing exercise that they have undertaken.Additional Director General of ICMR G S Toteja advocated that RT-PCR throat/nasal swab test is the best use for diagnosis of COVID-19. RT-PCR test detects the virus early and is the best strategy to identify and isolate the individual, the advisory said. ICMR also said the country had not lost a single rupee in the process.ICMR’s clarification came after opposition Congress demanded transparency in the procurement and rendering process of all COVID-19 related equipment following evidence that the Indian importer and the distributor of the kits had profiteered to the extent of Rs 18.75 crore by selling the kits at higher prices to ICMR.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was the first to raise the issue on Monday with party spokesman Manish Tewari later alleging that money had changed hands and the ICMR needed to come clean.“The kits were bought from China at the cost of Rs 245 per kit, and sold to ICMR at the cost of Rs 600 a kit. There were five lakh kits that were imported. The importer sold the kits to the company contracted by the ICMR for procurement at the rate of Rs 400 a kit and this contractor sold the same kit to ICMR for Rs 600 per kit. Both profiteered to the extent of Rs 18 crore,” Tewari said.ICMR however rejected any allegations of a scam and said the order had been cancelled and no advance payment was made to anyone.“Not even a single rupee has been lost,” ICMR said.ICMR earlier said it decided to go with Wondfo’s exclusive distributor for India for the kit because this distributor quoted an all inclusive price for FOB (logistics) without any clause for advance whereas the Chinese firm when contacted directly by ICMR had sought 100 per cent advance payment without giving any timeline commitments.“It needs to be remembered that this was the first ever effort by any Indian agency to procure such kits and the rate quoted by the bidders was the only reference point. After receipt of some supplies, ICMR has again conducted quality checks on these kits in field conditions.  Based on scientific assessment of their performance, the order in question (Wondfo) along with order in respect of another make found under-performing have been cancelled.”“It needs to be stressed that ICMR has not made any payment whatsoever in respect of these supplies. Because of the due process followed (not going for procurement with 100 per cent advance amount), GoI does not stand to lose a single rupee,” ICMR said.ICMR had placed the order of five lakh rapid kits that were procured through the Indian distributor of the equipment by Chinese firm.The government meanwhile said it had enough stocks of RTPCR kits to test all eligible people for COVID.

27-04-2020||New Delhi||IIT-Madras start-up develops smart dustbin system to prevent Covid-19 spread||An IIT-incubated start-up has developed a ‘smart bin system’ to prevent the spread of Covid-19 through waste generated at hospitals, clinics, public places and quarantine zones.Called ‘AirBin’, the system developed by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras, enables remote monitoring of waste accumulation levels through smart phone. The system can be retrofitted on to existing garbage bins on nearby poles, walls or the bin lids.According to start-up ‘Antariksh’, the digital waste management system can generate alerts to sanitation teams at regular intervals on fill levels and on-demand clearance requests from end-users for faster disposal of contagious waste.“While we are dealing with the spread of Covid-19, hazardous waste is being generated in hospitals, quarantine zones or red zone areas within cities. They are potential sources of Covid-19 and can cause further spread within the locality. This makes timely clean-up of bins vital along with other best practices for disinfection to prevent further spread of Covid,” said Mahek Mahendra Shah, a mechanical engineering graduate from the institute.“The objective is to help rural and urban local bodies clear every bin before it overflows and accelerate sustainability. The product is likely to hit market in five months. We will supply first 200 AirBin devices across India in the next few months with long-term plans to deliver 1,00,000 units for 100 Smart Cities in India,” he added.The team claims that only 28 per cent of the waste generated in India is recycled and various studies found that the waste generated in the country was doubling every five years.“The system will enable clearing waste bins before they overflow. Waste management processes will play a key role in containing contagion at public or private spaces. From waste collection, transport, segregation, disposal to recycling, every process needs to be overhauled quickly and technology can play a vital role in this transformation.

27-04-2020||New Delhi||Do you have any plan on shifting migrant workers to their native places, SC asks Centre||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to spell out if it had any plans to shift lakhs of migrant workers—stranded due to COVID-19 lockdown—to their native places.A Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to inform it within a week after advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing petitioner Jagdeep Chhoker and Gaurav Jain, insisted that fundamental rights of migrant workers were being violated.Citing certain media reports, Bhushan alleged that more than 90 per cent of the stranded migrant workers were not receiving wages, ration and other essential items. Being an institution created by the Constitution, the court should protect their rights, he submitted.However, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta vehemently opposed Bhushan’s submission and said the reports were wrong and that he was not the only person worried about plight of migrants.Sending migrant workers back to their villages would defeat the very purpose of lockdown as it might lead to spread of COVID-19 in rural areas, Mehta argued.The government was already dealing with the matter in consultation with states, he said.As lakhs of migrant workers remain stranded in various cities, former Dean of Indian Institute of Management (Ahmedabad) Chhoker and advocate Jain demanded that the authorities should make necessary arrangements for their return home.Restriction of movement of migrant workers and their confinement in the city of their migration in a shelter homes violated their rights to freedom of movement and right to live with human dignity guaranteed under Article 19 and Article 21 of the Constitution respectively, they contended.Stranded away from home at various places during this health crisis, migrant workers were the worst affected people, the petition submitted.During hearing of another PIL, the Centre had recently told the top court that close to seven lakh migrant workers had been accommodated in more than 21,000 temporary shelters across India and they were being given food and medical facilities. It had said their march was halted to prevent spread of the pandemic.But the petitioners said the distressed migrant workers should be allowed to go back home in view of the extension of nationwide lockdown till May 3 after subjecting them to COVID-19 test.Those who test negative for COVID-19 should be allowed to go home and shouldn’t be forcefully kept in shelter homes and the authorities should arrange for the safe travel, the petitioners demanded.Arrangements for COVID-19 testing can be made for those willing to go back to their native places either in the state of their departure or in the state of their arrival, the petition submitted.It should be done without compromising on the norm of physical distancing, it added.However, another plea filed in the Supreme Court last week opposed any move to send back lakhs of migrant workers to their native places. Petitioner Kamlakar R Chenoy contended that it was necessary to contain the spread of COVID-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/do-you-have-any-plan-on-shifting-migrant-workers-to-their-native-places-sc-asks-centre-77057

27-04-2020||New Delhi||CRPF seeks K’taka DGP’s intervention to probe ‘manhandling, handcuffing’ of commando by cops||The Central Reserve Police Force has taken up with the Karnataka Police the “unpleasant” case of alleged manhandling and handcuffing of its CoBRA commando by policemen and has sent a team to follow-up on the matter, officials said on Monday. The Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) unit of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) specialises in guerrilla tactics and jungle warfare.The force has written a letter to Karnataka Director General of Police (DGP) Praveen Sood stating that the “unpleasant situation could have been avoided had the state police taken the CRPF hierarchy into confidence before making the arrest” of the jawan on April 23 in Belagavi district.The CRPF is mulling to file “a counter FIR against the atrocious action of the police” against the jawan, a senior officer of the paramilitary force told PTI.          The CRPF letter said commando Sachin Savant was “manhandled, ill-treated, paraded to the police station barefooted, kept in chains and handcuffs” by police personnel on COVID-19 lockdown duty in Examba village of the district.In a video, shot from a distance by a local on a mobile phone, it is seen the mufti wearing commando and two policemen getting into an altercation, and subsequently, throwing blows at each other.The CoBRA commando was on leave and at his home town.As per the CRPF, the state police informed them that Savant was outside his home to wash his bike and “was not wearing a mask”, and police personnel on duty asked him why he was not wearing a face mask.The police report said the commando “started the altercation” with the beat constable and another policeman accompanying him and “assaulted” them.CRPF officials countered the version saying the jawan informed the policemen that he was not wearing the mask as he was just outside his home.The incident has led to resentment among officials of the paramilitary force and they have demanded a fair investigation in the case and sought intervention from the CRPF brass.“We have taken up the case with state police chief of Karnataka. His (Savant) bail plea is coming before the court on Tuesday and the CRPF too shall be in court through its local officers.Thereafter, case investigation shall be followed up to take it to the logical conclusion,” CRPF spokesperson Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Moses Dhinakaran said.The CRPF has stated in the letter to the DGP that after scrutiny of the video “it is apparent that the conduct of police personnel was not citizen centric”.The letter, written by a special director general-rank officer on behest of CRPF Chief A P Maheshwari, requested the DGP to get the matter inquired and “provide justice to the jawan keeping the gravity of the incident and its impact on the relationship between the two forces.” It said the CRPF is a force “with high standards of discipline and it has institutional mechanism for taking care of such situations”.  The commando told the police he was also a policeman like them and knew his responsibilities, and then he agreed to go back inside his house and ended the argument. But then the  police personnel pushed him and rained ‘lathi’ on him leading to assault between the two sides, CRPF officials alleged.The police report said the commando has been arrested under sections of the IPC and Epidemic Diseases Act and is at present in judicial custody at the local Sadalga police station.A photograph, now viral on social media and also available with CRPF authorities, shows Savant handcuffed and squatting in a place that was claimed to be the local police station.“Is this the way to treat a commando of a uniformed force? The jawan was treated like a dreaded criminal by putting handcuff and chain which are in any case disallowed to be put on a person,” a senior CRPF official said.The commando is posted with the 207th battalion of the CoBRA.  This unit is presently deployed for anti-Naxal operations in Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.

He said that as per experts, the impact of coronavirus will remain visible in the coming months,” the statement added.Modi also said that masks and face covers will become part of lives of people in the days ahead, adding everyone’s aim must be to ensure rapid response under the current circumstances.Among those present at the virtual meet, included Home Minister Amit Shah, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan and top officials from the PMO and the Union Health Ministry.The chief ministers who attended the meeting included Arvind Kejriwal (Delhi), Uddhav Thackeray (Maharashtra), E K Palaniswami (Tamil Nadu), Conrad Sangma (Meghalaya) Trivendra Singh Rawat (Uttarakhand) and Yogi Adityanath (Uttar Pradesh).Not possible to bring back students: NitishBihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar told Prime Minister Narendra Modi the state was scrupulously adhering to the central guidelines on lockdown, and it would not be possible to bring back students from places like Kota until the directions are suitably amended."Our students are not just in Kota but also many other parts of the country... it would not be possible to bring them back until the Centre amends its guidelines, which we are adhering to suitably," he said.Tourism has taken a hit, says Uttarakhand CMUttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said the nationwide lockdown has dealt a blow to tourism in the state, but expressed hope that things will get back on track under Narendra Modi's leadership."Uttarakhand has been a centre of tourism, especially religious tourism, which has suffered due to the lockdown, but we are confident that under the leadership of the Prime Minister, the situation will improve again," Rawat said after participating in the Prime Minister's video-conference with Chief Ministers.State fully prepared to deal with any situation: KhattarHaryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar apprised Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the state was fully prepared to deal with any situation arising due to the coronavirus crisis.“Efforts are being made to revive economic activities in the state in a safe manner,” said Khattar.Khattar also urged the Centre to take quick steps to remove the prevailing uncertainty around the dates of competitive examinations, like the Combined Defence Services, the JEE and the NEET.Most CMs want lockdown to continueMeanwhile, Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy said a majority of Chief Ministers who interacted with the Prime Minister on Monday wanted the lockdown to continue after May 3.The Chief Ministers were unanimous in telling the Prime Minister that the way the virus was spreading, there needs to be a cautious approach in lifting the lockdown, revealed Narayanasamy.The Chief Ministers also said that the government should evolve a policy for sending home migrant workers stranded in different states. "But, the Prime Minister did not give any solution to resolve the migrants issue," said Narayanasamy.Goa borders to remain sealed, says Pramod SawantGoa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said his government was of the opinion that the lockdown in the coastal state should be extended beyond May 3.After the meeting with Prime Minister in the morning, Sawant told reporters that Goa borders would remain sealed, while the economic activities in the state would resume gradually.He said the Goa government would write to the Prime Minister, urging him to extend the lockdown beyond May 3. Rupani favours gradual lifting      Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani favoured a gradual lifting of the lockdown.Rupani maintained that interests of daily-wage labourers, small as well as big shop owners and self-earning people should be kept in mind if the lockdown was to be extended beyond May 3.Lockdown needs to be gradually lifted. The state will follow the Centres guidelines and lift the lockdown in a gradual and step by step manner, depending on the number of cases going down (in different areas), secretary in the Chief Ministers Office, Ashwani Kumar, quoted Rupani as telling the meeting.Conrad Sangma pushes for Rapid Response SystemMeghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma is in favour of extending the lockdown.The Chief Minister, however, said some relaxations would be introduced in green zones and non COVID-19 affected districts."At the video conference called by Honble PM @narendramodi ji and Honble Home Minister @AmitShah ji. We have mooted to continue with the lockdown in #Meghalaya. #CovidUpdates," Sangma tweeted after the video conference.Sangma also suggested that the Meghalaya model of ‘Rapid Response System’ be adopted elsewhere too. He said, "The rapid response system will enable the government to work at the micro-level, like the panchayat institutions, and prepare us for any such situation that may arise in the future." Under the Rapid Response System the health department, general administration and police respond in unison within a specified time for detection of the new COVID-19 cases.Resume economic activities in green zones: Jai Ram ThakurHimachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur also said lockdown should continue beyond May 3. He, however, said states should be allowed to resume economic activities particularly in the green zones.Supporting the lockdown extension, Thakur said the restrictions on movement of people should continue as COVID-19 cases were still emerging. “The lockdown should be extended after May 3 to check the spread of novel coronavirus,” said Thakur.

27-04-2020||Indore||Private hospital in Indore starts plasma therapy trials||A private hospital in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, has started plasma therapy trials on three Covid-19 patients, who are in serious condition, an official said on Monday.Two doctors, who recovered from Covid-19 after treatment, came forward to donate their plasma for these patients, said Dr Ravi Dosi, head at chest disease department, Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences (SAIMS).Indore has emerged as a Covid-19 hotspot in the state. The district has so far reported 1,207 Covid-19 cases and 60 deaths.“Plasma therapy has been started on three serious Covid-19 patients, including a woman, in our hospital. We are hopeful of positive results,” Dr Dosi said.The three patients are aged between 30 and 60 years, he said, adding the experiment may continue for next 14 days. The doctors who have donated plasma became Covid-free after undergoing treatment at SAIMS, he added.The official also informed that the two doctors did not work at SAIMS.One of the donors, Dr Izhar Munshi (54), said: “When I was asked to donate plasma, I immediately said yes. Only one sentence is echoing in my mind - Corona will lose, India will win.”Munshi said he has obtained a list of 60 people from SAIMS who had recovered from Covid and would request them to donate plasma.The other donor, Dr Iqbal Nabi Qureshi (39), a liver diseases specialist, said this was a small contribution from him in the battle against Covid-19.Qureshi, who recovered from the disease, said people need not panic as most patients recover from the infection after proper treatment. “However, it is a rapidly spreading disease. So, care must be taken for protection against it,” he added.Convalescent plasma therapy is an experimental procedure for Covid-19 patients. In this treatment, plasma from a cured Covid-19 patient is transfused to a critically ill coronavirus patient.The idea behind the therapy is that immunity can be transferred from a healthy person to a sick patient using convalescent plasma. This therapy uses antibodies from the blood of a cured Covid-19 patient to treat another critical patient.Several countries around the world, including the United Kingdom and the United States, have also started plasma therapy trials.

When will the foodgrains stored in government warehouses be used?” she asked.The BSP leader also demanded immediate financial help for migrants.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/when-will-foodgrain-stored-in-govt-warehouses-be-used-asks-mayawati-77044
27-04-2020||---||SC asks Centre to put on record its policy on full payment of wages by pvt companies||New Delhi, April 27The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to place on record its policy with regard to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) notification directing private companies/firms to pay full salaries/wages to their employees and workers during COVID19 lockdown.A Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana issued the direction on petitions filed by Ludhiana Hand Tools Association, Ficus Pax Private Limited -- a packaging company from Karnataka and others challenging the March 29 MHA notification asking them to ensure that no employee/worker is terminated and they were paid full salaries and wages.However, Mumbai-based textile firm Nagreeka Exports chose to withdraw its petition.An association of 41 companies and firms from Punjab had last week moved the Supreme Court against the MHA notification asking private establishments to pay full wages to workers during COVID19 lockdown.Ludhiana Hand Tools Association also challenged the validity of Section 10(2)(i) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.The provisions of this Act cannot “impinge upon express provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and take away the right to lay off workmen during times of natural calamity, it said.Terming the MHA order under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, as arbitrary, it said the order violated the private companies' right to carry on any occupation, trade or business guaranteed under Articles 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.“Govt has not taken any steps for workforce, instead put the burden on employers to pay full wages," the petitioner said.An employer and employee have reciprocal promises whereby the right of an employee to demand salary is reciprocal to performance of work by such employee, the petition said, adding that an employer has a right not to pay if no work is done.Private employers should be completely exempted from paying their workmen during the lockdown as one-sided implementation of contract alone was not permitted, it argued.The Disaster Management Act -- under which these notifications for payment of salaries were issued -- didn't provide for continued payment of wages by employers to their employees and workers during any disaster, the companies, said, adding orders were beyond the scope of the Act.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-centre-to-put-on-record-its-policy-on-full-payment-of-wages-by-pvt-companies-77043
27-04-2020||Bengaluru||Govt should impose ‘COVID cess’ on ultra-rich to offset revenue loss: Kumaraswamy||Former Karnataka Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy on Monday suggested imposing “COVID cess” on the ultra-rich to offset the loss of revenue, as he called for citizen-centric measures and lower the cost of living, to help those affected by the lockdown.Cautioning the state and Central governments about the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on economy and people in turn, the JD(S) leader advised for measures like partial waivers of EMIs, rents, school fees, cut in petrol and diesel prices.“According to RBI and international economic assessment agencies, the GDP growth rate of the country is expected to fall to a historic low. Such a dire situation calls for citizen centric measures like full or partial waivers of EMIs, rents, school fees and other levies,” Kumaraswamy tweeted.Stating that the economy won’t bounce back within a very short period, he said, it is important to lower the cost of living as spending power of the consumer has depleted.“The govt must cut the petrol and diesel prices. The loss of revenue may be offset partially by imposing COVID cess on the ultra rich,” he added.Further, Kumaraswamy said, it is high time the government announced schemes to save livelihoods of people, especially those in the unorganised sector.The government should provide immediate relief to farmers, construction workers, cab and auto drivers, garment workers, etc, he added.India’s GDP is likely to range between a decline of 0.9 per cent and a growth of 1.5 per cent in the current financial year, with the economy undergoing a “turbulent” phase caused by the coronavirus-induced lockdown, according to a recent report by CII.

27-04-2020||---||SC seeks Centre's response to journalists unions' plea against sacking of scribes||New Delhi, April 27The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to respond to a PIL seeking directions to media houses not to sack journalists and non-journalists working with them during the Covid-19 lockdown."Other unions are also saying this. The question is if business does not start, how long will they sustain? The issue needs hearing," a Bench of Justice NV Ramana, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice BR Gavai said.The Bench issued notice on the petition jointly filed by three unions of journalists after senior advocate Colin Gonsalves said a large number of journalists had been sacked and even a greater number of them were facing salary cut.It asked the petitioners to hand over a copy of the petition to Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to enable the government to respond to it.National Alliance of Journalists, Delhi Union of Journalists and Brihanmumbai Union of Journalists had last week jointly moved the Supreme Court seeking directions to media houses not to sack journalists and non-journalists during the Covid-19 crisis."Journalists and non-journalists employees working in the print, electronic and digital media sector are carrying out essential services as per the order of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, dated March 24," the petitioners submitted.They alleged that media houses were using the Covid-19 lockdown for layoffs and salary cuts.The petitioners also mentioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi's appeal to employers to show compassion and not to sack employees.The PIL sought to highlight the "inhuman and illegal treatment" being meted out by employers to their employees and workers in the newspapers and media sectors, by issuing termination notices, imposing steep wage cuts unilaterally, sending workers and employees on indefinite unpaid leaves, and so on, taking the excuse of the nation-wide “lockdown” imposed in light of the spread of Covid-19.It stated that several newspapers, magazines, online media outlets and other employers in the media sector have reportedly taken steps after the announcement of the nation-wide lockdown in March 2020 to retrench workers and employees and to impose wage cuts.This was being done despite advisories issued by the Ministry of Labour & Employment, Government of India and even appeals by the Prime Minister of India to not terminate the services or reduce the wages of their employees, the PIL submitted.The petitioners urged the top court to issue an order directing all media houses employing journalists and non-journalists to put on hold with immediate effect all termination of service notices issued, resignation from services received from employees, all wage reductions and directions to go on leave without pay after the announcement of lockdown.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-centres-response-to-journalists-unions-plea-against-sacking-of-scribes-77039
27-04-2020||Lucknow||UP govt should wake up to situation in Agra: Akhilesh Yadav||SP chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday asked the UP government to “wake up” to the situation in Agra that has been grappling with a spike in cases of coronavirus and cited a letter written by the city Mayor to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to “save Agra”.Agra Mayor Naveen Jain had written a hard-hitting letter to Adityanath on April 21, requesting him to take measures to improve health care facilities in the city to deal with coronavirus.“According to the Mayor, the much-touted Agra model of Chief Minister has failed and will make Agra, Wuhan (China). No testing, no medicines and private hospitals for other diseases, no life-saving kits and now mismanagement of quarantine centres is proving deadly. Wake up government,” Yadav said in a tweet in Hindi.A total of 372 cases of coronavirus were reported in Agra till Sunday. While ten people have died, 49 were treated and discharged. The number of active cases is 313.In his letter, Jain had said, “I am writing this letter with a very sad mind that my Agra is going through a phase of excessive problems. The need is to take bold decision to save Agra, where the situation has become very serious.

27-04-2020||---||SC notice to Ministry, DGCA on PIL demanding full refund on air ticket cancellation||New Delhi, April 27The Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to the Civil Aviation Ministry and the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on a PIL demanding full automatic refund of money for tickets booked for flights during the Covid-19 lockdown.A Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana asked the Civil Aviation Ministry and the DGCA to respond to the PIL which alleged that airlines were violating the Ministry's guidelines on the issue.Filed by Pravasi Legal Cell — an NGO — the PIL said both domestic and international airlines were violating the Ministry's order which obliged them to fully refund amount for tickets cancelled on account of Covid-19 lockdown.Pointing out that instead of a full refund, airlines were providing a credit shell, valid up to one year, the PIL submitted that failure to refund the full amount collected for tickets owing to cancellation of flights due to restrictions imposed by the government to prevent spread of Covid-19 violated DGCA's Civil Aviation Requirement, 2008.It referred to the Ministry's April 16 Office Memorandum (OM) which directed all airline operators to refund the full amount collected for all tickets booked during the first phase of the lockdown between March 25 and April 14 both for domestic and international bookings.This was also applicable to cancellation of the tickets booked during the first phase of the lockdown for travel during the second phase of the lockdown between April 15 and May 3, the OM stated. Airlines were not allowed to levy any cancellation charges, it said.Pointing out that OM only asks airlines to refund money for only tickets booked during the lockdown period, the NGO said it "leaves out the vast majority of passengers who had booked tickets before the flights were banned and thus indirectly approves the practice of the Airlines providing Credit Shell for booking effected before the lockdown, though the same clearly violates the refund rules of the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA)."Terming the April 16 OM as ambiguous, the petitioner demanded that there should be automatic immediate refund on flight cancellations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-ministry-dgca-on-pil-demanding-full-refund-on-air-ticket-cancellation-77031

If any other state has done so much for them, they should bring it to our notice,” the Uddhav Thackeray-led said.It also referred to some recent comments of Union minister Nitin Gadkari on the need for policy measures to create jobs in rural areas and check migration to cities for employment.“What Gadkari has said is crucial. If these people wish to return to Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, how are they going to feed themselves. There is no work for these people anywhere in the country during the current crisis,” the Sena said.

Shame, disgust at this corrupt mentality.” He also demanded that PM Modi intervene to take “strict action” against the profiteers.“The country will never forgive them,” he added.That any human being would try & profiteer from the immeasurable suffering of millions of his brothers & sisters, is beyond belief & comprehension.

The US, expectedly, leads the pack.Russia ($ 65.1 billion) and Saudi Arabia ($ 61.9 billion) are at the fourth and fifth spots, respectively. Pakistan is at the 24th spot, down from the 19th spot it occupied last year.The details were released on Monday morning by Swedish think-tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Titled 'Trends in World Military Expenditure, 2019', the report, released annually, said, “India spent $ 71.1 billion on defence in 2019 which was 2.4 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP).”India was at the fourth spot last year and has jumped up a spot. At $ 71.1 billion, India had the highest military spending in South Asia during 2019. It was 6.8 per cent higher in 2019 than in 2018. India’s military expenditure has risen significantly over the past few decades.The SIPRI report said, “India’s expenditure has grown by 259 per cent over the 30-year period, 1990–2019, and by 37 per cent over the decade 2010–19.” However, its military burden fell from 2.7 per cent of GDP in 2010 to 2.4 per cent in 2019.“India’s tensions and rivalry with both Pakistan and China are among the major drivers for its increased military spending,” said the report quoting Siemon T Wezeman, SIPRI’s Senior Researcher.China’s military expenditure reached $ 261 billion in 2019, a 5.1 per cent increase compared with 2018. “China’s military expenditure has increased continuously since 1994 (for 25 consecutive years),” the report said. The growth in its military spending has closely matched the country’s economic growth. Between 2010 and 2019, China’s military burden remained almost unchanged, at 1.9 per cent of its GDP.Pakistan’s military expenditure rose by 70 per cent over the decade 2010–19, to reach $ 10.3 billion. Its military burden increased from 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2010 to 4 per cent in 2019, the report said.  The report also narrates the growing military expenses in the Asian region. It says in addition to China and India, Japan ($ 47.6 billion) and South Korea ($ 43.9 billion) were the largest military spenders in Asia and Oceania. Military expenditure in the region has risen every year since at least 1989.US leads the race  With an expense of $ 732 billion, the US remained by far the largest spender in the world in 2019, accounting for 38 per cent of global military spending. The US spent almost as much on its military in 2019 as the next 10 highest spenders combined. US military expenditure was 5.3 per cent higher in 2019 than in 2018. This is the second year of growth in US military spending following seven years of continuous decline—between 2010 and 2017 spending fell by 22 per cent. The growth in the US’s military spending between 2017 and 2019 can be attributed to an increase in personnel costs from the recruitment of 16,000 additional military personnel and the ongoing modernisation of its conventional and nuclear weapon inventories.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-and-china-emerge-among-top-three-military-spenders-77001

Most CMs told the PM that the lockdown should continue and economic activities should be started gradually,” Narayanasamy said.He said he personally told the government that the lockdown call would be that of the Centre. “I also told the PM that activities should be started under stipulated conditions,” said the Congress leader.The Puducherry CM said the PM praised Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot for active contact tracing and containment efforts on COVID 19 and also lauded Odisha’s efforts.The Congress veteran said the PM did not respond to the demand for economic package which some CMs raised nor was a solution given to the challenge on the migrant labour front.The states, Narayanasamy said, also demanded GST compensation from the Centre.“We also asked for a stimulus package for economic revival and a package for MSMEs,” he said.Only nine CMs made presentations at the PM’s meeting — those of Meghalaya, Mizoram, Puducherry, Uttarakhand, Himachal, Odisha, Bihar, Gujarat and Haryana.Punjab CM Amarinder Singh did not attend the meeting.

27-04-2020||Lucknow||PPE-clad worker leaves food outside locked gate at Agra quarantine centre||Several video clips of a quarantine centre in Agra have gone viral showing a PPE-clad worker leaving food and water bottles outside locked iron gates, forcing inmates to jostle and push to get hold of them.The centre is one of the institutions of the Sharda Group of Institutions in the city that has been taken over as a corona quarantine centre.In one video clip posted by a woman inside the centre, she charges the district administration of bringing them here on the pretext of conducting checkups.“No checkups are being conducted. I am one of them over here. I was told that my medical checkup would be conducted at Sarojini Naidu Medical College. Both the doctors and administration are showing apathy of every kind. Neither are the inmates fed properly nor getting anything to drink”.After the clips went viral Agra District Magistrate Prabhu Naranyan Singh spoke to reporters and said that he had already gone to the centre twice and plugged all the gaps.“The Chief Development Officer has been asked to investigate the matter and fix responsibility as there was a separate team formed to handle this task. The team has been asked to work properly and to ensure that such complaints are not received again,” said the Agra DM.The video clip assumes significance, as Agra is the worst district in Uttar Pradesh with 372 positive cases and 10 deaths. It was the district where the first positive case was reported as early as the first week of March. It has 84 hotspots.Just a day ago Agra Mayor Naveen Jain’s letter had gone viral on the social media. In the letter written to the chief minister, Yogi Aditynath Jain pleaded with him to save his city.In the April 21 letter that has now been shared on the social media by Congress President Priyanka Gandhi Vadra Jain blames the Agra official machinery of all-round failure.“My Agra is in crisis. Hard decisions are needed. With folded hands I plead with you to save my Agra,” says the letter, a copy of which has also been sent to Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma, who is in charge of Agra district.In his letter, the mayor has pointed out the scarcity of milk and fresh vegetables as well as ill-equipped hospitals to cater to the rising cases.He has pointed out that for days no officer was visiting quarantine centres that have been since been declared hotspots.Virtually substantiating the video clip, Jain charged that there wasn’t any proper arrangement of food or drinking water for the persons staying at the quarantine centres.“In government hospitals, no non-corona patient is being attended to which has turned the situation explosive”, said Jain.“All promises of doorstep delivery are a farce. The officials have failed to make it work. The CMO has been unsuccessful to even ensure facilities at the district hospital. Senior officials remain at home. They come out barely for 15-20 minutes for photo opportunities for the record. The government’s image is being tarnished,” alleged the mayor.Reproducing the Agra mayor’s letter in a tweet Priyanka Gandhi Vadra urged the UP government to take immediate steps before the matter goes out of hand.Advising the state government to take the mayor’s letter in a positive spirit, Priyanka asked the state government to take constructive steps to save the people of Agra to survive the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ppe-clad-worker-leaves-food-outside-locked-gate-at-agra-quarantine-centre-76991

27-04-2020||by Satya Prakash||Constitutional statesmanship: A long way to go for governors||In the midst of the Covid crisis, Madhya Pradesh witnessed a change in government, thanks to the Supreme Court which ordered a floor test. The Kamal Nath government resigned without facing the Assembly, thereby paving the way for Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government to occupy power in the state.The case once again brings the focus back on the discretionary powers of governors under the Constitution; its use, misuse and abuse attracting judicial scrutiny at the highest level.Unlike the President, the governor enjoys certain discretionary powers under the Constitution. While Article 74 simply says the President shall act in accordance with the advice of the council of ministers headed by the Prime Minister, Article 163 clearly carves out an exception where the governor is required to exercise his functions or any of them under the Constitution in his discretion.The President can only ask the council of ministers to reconsider an advice, but once reiterated, he is bound by it. The governor's powers are on a different footing as there are several occasions, including imposition of President's rule where he is expected to use his discretionary powers to discharge his constitutional obligations.Primarily there were two issues in these petitions - whether the governor is entrusted with the authority to call for a trust vote in the course of a running Assembly, and whether Madhya Pradesh Governor Lalji Tandon exercised his authority correctly.In summoning the House and in taking a decision to prorogue or dissolve it, the governor ordinarily acts on the aid and advice of the council of ministers. But his discretionary powers under Article 163 of the Constitution are an exception to the general rule of aid and advice.Relying on the nine-judge Constitution Bench in SR Bommai's case (1994), a Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud held that a governor has the power to call for a floor test and the MP Governor exercised it rightly. "The governor is not denuded of the power to order a floor test...," it said.However, the SC said the purpose of entrusting such a function to the governor is not to destabilise an existing government. Also, his decision to order a floor test is subject to judicial review. The governor is expected to discharge the role of a "constitutional statesman", it said.While the top court's expectations are legitimate, it's important to appreciate the complex role assigned to the governor. As head of the executive in a state, he is mandated to act on aid and advice of the council of ministers. He is also part of the State Legislature and is supposed to summon, prorogue and dissolve the House when advised. He is expected to send report to the Centre for imposition of President's rule under Article 356 of the Constitution as and when situation warrants. He is also required to ask the government to face a floor test if he thinks it has lost majority in the House.The top court expects the governor to display "constitutional statesmanship" but the fact remains that his position depends on "doctrine of pleasure" under Article 156(1) of the Constitution. It means he can be removed unceremoniously for not obeying his political masters who often expect him to toe the party line.This is where "constitutional statesmanship" is subjected to petty political maneuvering and what comes out inthe process is left for the judiciary to handle.The Constitution Review Commission had recommended that the governor should be appointed after consultation with the CM. Normally, the five-year term should be adhered to.In July 2004, when the UPA government removed the governors of Gujarat, Goa, Haryana and UP, the decision was challenged. The SC ruled in 2010 that a governor couldn't be removed on the ground that he was out of sync with the policies and ideologies of the party in power at the Centre.There are governors who are practical. There are others who are pragmatic. And finally there is the rare category of visionary ones. While the practical ones simply obey their political masters, the pragmatic ones attempt to strike a balance between the constitutional propriety and political considerations. The visionary ones such as KM Munshi are a rare breed.Dr BR Ambedkar said, "However good a Constitution may be, if those who are implementing it are not good, it will prove to be bad. However bad a Constitution may be, if those implementing it are good, it will prove to be good." More than any other constitutional position, it applies to governors.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/constitutional-statesmanship-a-long-way-to-go-for-governors-76950

RSS chief on Palghar lynching||New Delhi, April 26RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat today condemned the killing of two ‘sadhus’ in Palghar and cautioned against forces inimical to India’s interests taking advantage of the Covid-19 situation. He also pitched for ‘swadeshi’ (indigenous) and ‘svavlamban’ (self-reliance) and urged the Sangh cadres to help everyone in these difficult times without discrimination and regardless of the community.‘Don’t target any community’Even if someone did something wrong, do not consider everyone guilty. Those in need of help are our own. It is our duty to help in this time of crisis. All 130 crore Indians are our own. — Mohan Bhagwat, RSS chiefAddressing the RSS cadres, Bhagwat spoke on the Palghar lynching incident and said it was the responsibility of the administration to keep law and order in check. “Sanyasis (saints) who pray for the well-being of humanity were brutally killed in Palghar. What were the police doing? Such an incident should not have happened,” he said.In an apparent reference to incidents involving Tablighi Jamaat and subsequent reactions, he said “All 130 crore are our countrymen. It is not correct to blame the entire community because of something some people may have done. We do not help with discrimination we help with a feeling of togetherness and affinity. We are not doing any favour, we are helping our own people.”He cautioned: “There are people who are trying to divide our country… we must be careful of such people. But because of such people we should not treat anyone with anger or vindictiveness.”Bhagwat appreciated pro-activeness shown by the BJP-led government in dealing with the crisis. India handled the pandemic effectively as government and people responded proactively, he said. Recalling PM Narendra Modi message to sarpancheson self-reliance, he said: “We must try to use things made here (in India), we must make do with whatever we make here, and if something is required from outside it would be at our own conditions. There should be no dependence on ‘videshi’.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-were-police-doing-rss-chief-on-palghar-lynching-76911

Multiple intelligence agencies assessing ground reports from across the LoC have found that Pakistan troops and the ISI have started gathering highly trained terrorists at the launching pads. The number is close to 400, sources told The Tribune.These militants have been brought from training camps run by the ISI in occupied Kashmir, Pakistan’s Punjab province and Afghanistan. They belong to known groups like LeT and JeM.Frustrated over the killing of militants in J&K at the hands of security forces, Pakistan’s big plan is to fill the gap caused by the death of militants in the recent months. This month alone, the forces have killed 22 terrorists while the total tally of terrorists killed since the beginning of this year has risen to 54, said a spokesperson of the Northern Command. This has jolted the terrorist infrastructure in J&K, particularly in the Valley.“Pakistan has big plans of sending a large number of terrorists along with weapons to this side of the LoC,” a source told The Tribune. The sources said the GoC of 15 Corps, Lt-Gen BS Raju, had been regularly visiting formations close to the LoC to oversee operational preparedness. The focus was on feedback and assessment of operational preparedness of troops deployed along the LoC.Dilbag Singh, DGP, had told the media recently that Pakistan was “trying to send Covid-infected terrorists to this side of the LoC.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-activates-launch-pads-to-push-400-terrorists-across-jk-border-76905

Nearly 44 per cent of those reached for a response were either curtailing their daily food intake or skipping one meal.People attributed people’s behaviour to “fear of the disease and uncertainty about the future with no clarity on either the span or the scope of the lockdown.” The survey also showed that despite the government making efforts to reach people with relief and supplies, access to such relief was not universal.Only 31 per cent of the respondents reported receiving relief in either cash or kind,” the ministry survey said, explaining the recent essential supply chain relaxations by the MHA which continues to review the supply status. On people’s knowledge of Covid-19 symptoms, the survey found the respondents wanting. Only 35 per cent were aware of three key symptoms (fever, cough and short breath), hinting at their poor ability to distinguish between common cold or flu and Covid-19.As many as 27 per cent could not identify any of the symptoms and 33 per cent did not know pre-symptomatic people could be carrying the virus.Millions of kids at riskMillions of children are in danger of missing life-saving vaccines against measles, diphtheria and polio due to disruptions in immunisation service amid the spread of Covid-19, the UNICEF has warned. With disruptions in immunisation services, the fates of millions of young lives “hang in the balance”. pti||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/food-insecure-indians-eating-less-skipping-meal-govt-study-76900

He asked people to shun any complacency that they would not be affected by the virus in case it hadn’t reached the places they lived or worked in.‘Shun complacency’You should in your over-enthusiasm not think that if the coronavirus has not yet reached your city, village, street or office, it is not going to reach now. Never make such a mistake. — Narendra Modi, Prime MinisterLauding state governments for fighting coronavirus in cooperation with the Centre, Modi said all sections of society had stepped in with humanitarianism in helping maintain social distancing and rendering help to people affected by the lockdown as India was in the middle of the fight.“The police personnel have endeared themselves to the public through their outreach to those in distress and distribution of food,” Modi said, adding that earlier the police evoked negative image among people.He urged people to be a part of a digital platform — covidwarriors.gov.in — which seeks to bring all crisis management stakeholders at one place. He appreciated the role of community leaders in the campaign against the disease.He commiserated that the outbreak of the disease continued during the holy month of Ramzaan, compelling caution and social distancing. “This is the time for more intense prayers and spiritualism so that the disease makes itself scarce by the time of upcoming Eid,” Modi said.He exhorted people to stop spitting in public places. Cautioning people not to be overconfident, he appealed to abide by the dictum — Do gaj ki doori, bahut hai jaroori (physical distance of two yards is very important) — in social manners and interactions.He said usage of face mask would emerge as a new symbol of a civilised society. He also urged people to follow the guidelines of Union Ministry of AYUSH on food intake and purificatory rituals which would help boost their bio-immune system.The PM expressed confidence that the world would acknowledge the significance of India’s traditional medicine system of Ayurveda in a similar way it adopted yoga.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-lower-guard-against-virus-pm-76869

Meanwhile, PM Modi exhorted countrymen to shun complacency.“Is there a comprehensive strategy which the Union Government is going to present to the CMs? The virus, in the absence of a vaccine, is here to stay and, therefore, we have to prepare ourselves. We have to prepare our people to live with the virus…”, Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said.Separately, in a letter to the PM, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury raised several issues, including the plight of migrant workers, return of Indians stuck overseas, unemployment, cooperative federalism, finances, wasteful expenditure, shortage of PPE and communal polarisation.The irresponsibility of the Tablighi Jamaat, he said, could not be an excuse for targeting the entire Muslim community and deepening social divisions. “It is up to the political leadership to put a stop to this forthwith. Otherwise it would be the greatest disservice to the fight against the pandemic and the people of the country”. The Congress sought to know why during the past 36 days, the government did not formulate a national plan on exit strategy, as envisaged under the National Disaster Management Act. “When the PM interacts with the Chief Ministers, the party does not want to hear homilies but a calibrated, clear, pointed plan for the next 90 days and what is that the Government of India, states and districts are expected to do to deal with Covid-19,” the Congress MP said. Advocating aggressive testing, also stressed by former PM Manmohan Singh Rahul Gandhi, he said this was a must.More virulent L-strain in Gujarat?Ahmedabad: The high Covid-19 mortality rate in Gujarat could be due to the dominance of the L-type strain of coronavirus, which was more prevalent in Wuhan, experts said. The dominance of the more virulent L-type strain as compared to the S-type could be behind the high mortality rate in the state, which has reported 133 deaths so far. PTIWuhan cases drop to zeroBeijing: The number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients in China’s Wuhan, where the virus first emerged, on Sunday dropped to zero for the first time.
