14-10-2020||New Delhi||India lampoons Pak at Commonwealth foreign ministers’ meet for raising Kashmir issue||India on Wednesday lampooned Pakistan at a virtual meeting of the Commonwealth foreign ministers, calling it a promoter of state sponsored terrorism “masquerading” as an alleged victim of the menace.Without directly naming Pakistan, India also referred to the neighbouring country’s dubious distinction of becoming synonymous with the phrase “epicentre of terrorism” and hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the United Nations.The sharp reaction by Secretary (West) in Ministry of External Affairs Vikas Swarup came in the meeting after Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi alleged that a state in South Asia is fanning hyper nationalism to “engineer” illegal demographic change in a disputed territory, in a reference to Kashmir.Swarup was representing External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar at the Commonwealth foreign ministers’ meeting.“When we heard them rant about a south Asian state, we were left wondering why it was describing itself? And not surprisingly it came from a globally acknowledged promoter of state sponsored terrorism masquerading as an alleged victim of the same,” Swarup said.“We heard it from a country that brought genocide to South Asia 49 years back when it killed its own people,” he said.Swarup also said it is the same country that has the dubious distinction of becoming synonymous with the phrase ‘epicentre of terrorism’ and hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the UN.“The only dispute left in what it alleged today as a ‘disputed territory’ is its own illegal occupation of certain parts, which sooner or later, it would have to vacate,” he said.Swarup also hit out at Pakistan for denying the rights of indigenous minorities. “For such a country to hypocritically preach about religious minority groups elsewhere, while trampling itself upon the rights of its own indigenous minorities, was indeed most regrettable, and a blatant misuse of this august platform,” Swarup said.In his address, Qureshi said while the world remained preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, a state in South Asia is targeting its religious minorities in order to foment division and hatred amongst community groups.                        “It has transgressed the rights and freedoms of millions and fanned hyper nationalism to engineer illegal demographic change in a disputed territory and sowed racial tensions. We ignore its transgressions only at our own peril,” he said.In his remarks, Swarup said it was unfortunate that the meeting was misused by one of the South Asian member states to pursue its “own bigoted, ill-conceived, narrow and unilateral agenda on a multilateral platform”.                            He also talked about India’s assistance to various countries to deal with COVID-19, and said as the world grapples with the economic and social fallout of the pandemic, the values and core principles of the Commonwealth become more relevant than ever.“India has already demonstrated that it can be a reliable partner for the world. Despite being severely impacted, we have kept our supply chains open during this pandemic and supplied medicines and equipment to more than 150 countries,” Swarup said.“This has only added to India’s reputation as the pharmacy to the world. As we move towards development of a COVID-19 vaccine, India (which accounts for 60 per cent of global vaccine production) has already committed its vaccine production and delivery capacity to help the world in fighting this crisis,” he said.Swarup also congratulated all members of the grouping for adopting a statement on racism.“Finally, as we adopt the Commonwealth Statement on Racism today, I would like to congratulate all members for this effort to combat racism and racial discrimination,” he said.It is also important to take robust and comprehensive steps to implement a zero tolerance policy against racism and ensure stricter actions against the perpetrators, he added.

14-10-2020||New Delhi||25-30 per cent drop in TB case notifications in India, Indonesia, the Philippines from January-June||Disruptions in services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to setbacks in global TB response with three high burden countries — India, Indonesia and Philippines reporting major reductions in case reporting.A new WHO report based on data collated from over 200 countries has shown significant reductions in TB case notifications, with 25-30 per cent drops reported inIndia, Indonesia, the Philippines between January and June 2020 compared to the same 6-month period in 2019.These reductions in case notifications could lead to a dramatic increase in additional TB deaths, according to WHO modelling, the WHO said noting that in many countries, human, financial and other resources have been reallocated from TB to the COVID-19 response.TB data collection and reporting systems have also been negatively impacted.“However, in line with WHO guidance, countries have taken measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on essential TB services, including by strengthening infection control. A total of 108 countries---including 21 countries with a high TB burden---have expanded the use of digital technologies to provide remote advice and support,” WHO said today.It said prior to the COVID-19 many countries were making steady progress in tackling tuberculosis (TB), with a 9 per cent reduction in incidence seen between 2015 and 2019 and a 14 per cent drop in deaths in the same period.Approximately 1.4 million people died from TB-related illnesses in 2019. Of the estimated 10 million people who developed TB that year, some 3 million were not diagnosed with the disease, or were not officially reported to national authorities.The situation is even more acute for people with drug-resistant TB. About 465 000 people were newly diagnosed with drug-resistant TB in 2019 and, of these, less than 40 pc were able to access treatment. There has also been limited progress in scaling up access to treatment to prevent TB.This situation could worsen if governments do not respond now, WHO said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/25-30-per-cent-drop-in-tb-case-notifications-in-india-indonesia-the-philippines-from-january-june-155737

Yusuf, Special Assistant on national security and strategic policy planning to Khan, said that Pakistan, however, wants three-way talks involving Kashmiris as well. Three-way talks are anathema to New Delhi which has earlier made it clear that there is no dispute on Kashmir. All that remains to be discussed is the handing over of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir to India.Yusuf’s statement comes a month after the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had said unelected advisers and special assistants to the PM cannot exercise executive or administrative powers in the functioning of the government. Only elected representatives chosen by people have the privilege to run the affairs of ministries, it had added while disposing of a petition challenging the appointment of another adviser to Pak PM.The court had also added that any executive function performed by any unelected member of the PM’s team would deem to have been taken illegally but said it was the PM’s prerogative to choose a person for giving him advice.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-talks-offer-claim-finds-no-takers-155730

However, CBSE had expressed its inability to waive the examination fees.The letter further said due to the ongoing pandemic, a large number of parents have lost their jobs and their incomes have been affected badly while their savings have already been used to meet their daily needs.“It is submitted that certain people and organisations have expressed their desire to offer financial support as a welfare measure and wish to pay the examination fee of some students of some schools as a noble cause. In view of that, CBSE is requested to kindly extend the date of submission of Examination fee up to November 14 in place of October 15,” the Directorate of Education of the Delhi government had said in its letter. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-extends-deadline-for-2021-board-exam-fee-payment-till-oct-31-155727

14-10-2020||Mumbai||ED searches premises of film producer who worked with Sushant Singh Rajput||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday conducted searches at the premises of a film producer in connection with its money laundering probe linked to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, officials said.They said the office and residential premises of Dinesh Vijan in Mumbai were raided under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Some transactions of the film producer with Rajput are under the agency’s scanner and the raids were conducted to obtain more information and evidence, they said.Vijan was questioned by the ED in this case in the past and he was grilled about the payments made by him to Rajput and some contracts between them, they said. Vijan had directed and produced the Hindi movie ‘Raabta’ that released in 2017 and had Rajput and actress Kriti Sanon in the lead roles.The ED’s money laundering case stems from an FIR filed by Rajput’s father on July 25 with the Bihar Police in Patna against the actor’s friend and live-in partner Rhea Chakraborty, her parents—father Indrajit Chakraborty and mother Sandhya Chakraborty—brother Showik, Rajput’s manager Samuel Miranda, Shruti Modi and unknown persons, accusing them of cheating and abetting his son’s suicide.The agency has questioned all of them in the past apart from Rajput’s father and some of his sisters.The 34-year-old actor was found dead at his flat in Mumbai’s Bandra area on June 14. The CBI and the Narcotics Control Bureau are also probing various angles linked to his death.

14-10-2020||New Delhi||Punjab ‘rail roko’ effect: Over 200 rakes of freight stranded; power plants on verge of being shut down||The “rail roko” protest in Punjab is causing severe disruption in the supply of essential commodities to and from the state, with more than 200 loaded rakes of freight being stranded across railway zones and many power plants on the verge of being shut down due to a shortage of coal, railway officials said on Wednesday.Farmers’ bodies are staging protests across Punjab against three farm laws recently passed by Parliament.Of the 200 rakes that are lying stranded, 79 are carrying coal, 22 fertiliser, three cement, two petroleum, oil and lubricants and 88 iron, steel and other products.The agitation has led to a complete cancellation of all passenger trains to Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir since September 24. Similarly, freight traffic across Punjab has been severely impacted since October 1.“As on date, more than 200 loaded rakes for Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir are stabled across various railway zones due to the ongoing farmers’ agitation. Regular messages are being received from industries and companies, whose rakes have got stuck due to the rail roko agitation. Even the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has reported that some power plants may have to be shut down due to a coal shortage,” an official said.Officials said while the Goindwal Sahib Power Plant has already shut down, the Talwandi and Nabha thermal power plants have coal stocks for only three and six days, respectively.Rail movement of wheat and rice by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) from Punjab to other states has also been stopped, leading to loss of loading of more than 25 foodgrain rakes daily, they added.The oil marketing companies (OMCs) have also expressed serious concerns regarding the supply of petroleum products for the Jammu depot, as the POL (petroleum, oil and lubricants) stocks are depleting fast.“They have requested for an immediate movement of rakes for meeting the demands for the Jammu area and further supplying to the Srinagar, Leh and Kargil areas. The general manager of the Northern Railway has taken up the issue with Punjab’s chief secretary, requesting for an immediate resumption of rail movement,” an official said.The “rail roko” agitation against the farm laws is likely to continue in Punjab as no decision could be taken at a meeting of 30 farmer organisations in Barnala on Saturday after most of their leaders failed to attend it. The protests have led to severe power outages in the state due to a reduced power generation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-rail-roko-effect-over-200-rakes-of-freight-stranded-power-plants-on-verge-of-being-shut-down-155721

The other two are seven and five years old.Officials said accused Ashish, who had received a bullet injury in his leg following an exchange of fire with police on Tuesday night, is also undergoing treatment at the district hospital. Police said the youth was stalking the 17-year-old girl.“He was arrested on Tuesday night in an encounter. He got injured in the encounter and is undergoing treatment at the district hospital,” Gonda Superintendent of Police Shailesh Kumar Pandey said.Meanwhile, local markets remained closed with traders demanding an impartial probe into the incident. Local Vyapaar Mandal general secretary Indal Kumar Dubey said, “The role of the Paraspur SHO seems suspicious. The entire incident should be impartially probed. An innocent person should not be framed.”            Acting Chief Medical Superintendent of the district hospital, Dr Indubala, said, “On the advice of the district administration, one of the girls has been referred to Lucknow’s King George’s Medical University for treatment. The two others are undergoing treatment in the district.”    Office-bearers of the Chaya Foundation, which works for the victims of acid attacks, had urged the district magistrate to shift the girl to Lucknow.A sub-inspector and two constables are accompanying her to Lucknow.Meanwhile, the accused’s mother, Laxmi Chaurasia, said her son has been wrongly framed as he was at his sister’s place in Bahraich (Biseswarganj) at the time of the incident. She claimed that police picked eight members of her family and called up her son. “If my son has done anything wrong, then he should be punished. If he is framed wrongly, then I will hang myself,” she said, stressing that she wanted to meet the UP chief minister.However, Additional Superintendent of Police Mahendra Kumar rubbished her claims. He said, “The allegations levelled by the mother of the accused are baseless. As per call data records, the accused had called the main victim a number of times. One of her younger sisters in her statement took his name.” He said the accused fired at the police force after seeing a cordon outside his house.“In retaliatory firing, the accused got a bullet injury in his leg. We have concrete proof that the accused threw acid on the girls,” he said.Earlier on Tuesday, a senior police officer had said the eldest sibling told them that the accused had been stalking her.The 17-year-old girl, whose engagement was fixed for October 23, suffered eye injuries.Taking note of the incident, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had directed the Gonda Superintendent of Police to take strict action against the culprit and ensure that such incidents are not repeated.Condemning the incident, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati and Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav had targeted the state government over the law-and-order situation. The BJP government is already facing criticism over the Hathras gangrape-murder case.

14-10-2020||New Delhi||NGO moves SC seeking to intervene in Hathras case||A Kerala-based NGO has moved the Supreme Court seeking to intervene in the Hathras case alleging that hateful speech and false narratives were being spread by the media against members of the upper caste community.The plea filed by NGO, Munnokka Samudaya Samrakshana Munnani (Forward Community Welfare Front), has sought norms for responsible discharge of responsibilities which would require all those reporting about a crime to first ascertain whether such crime was indeed the outcome of caste-based discrimination.The NGO said it was aggrieved by the publication of "purely speculative theories" in print, electronic, digital and social media that the Hathras case was result of caste rivalry.The petition said there was a need for genuine and responsible reporting and dissemination of facts and opinions on the facts of the case and the events surrounding the case in order to curb any spread of hateful speech or narratives which would consequently lead to friction and enmity between the members of different communities.“It needs no emphasis that news reporting which tends to cater to speculative theories on such occasions will only lead to inflaming passions and greatly damage the already fragile social fabric of the nation and set back our pursuit of achieving the laudable constitutional goals of equality and fraternity,” read the plea.The NGO said the random use of caste in the reporting of crimes even when the caste of the involved parties was of no relevance, only helps to vilify and malign entire sections of people, leaving them with no legal remedy and needs to be checked.     “In the instant case which the applicant organisation is seeking to highlight too, the reckless mentions are against an amorphous group which is left with no legal remedy to defend itself and has to live with the ignominy and guilt of being roped into a horrific crime it had no collective role in,” the plea added.A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital during treatment.The victim was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on September 30.Her family alleged that they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites. Local police officers, however, said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".

India recently welcomed US plans to develop defence ties with Maldives, a move that South Block routinely resisted earlier.At the India-US Forum on Tuesday, Biegun joined Shringla to underscore the importance of the US-India partnership, particularly in advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific. The Deputy Secretary emphasised the work of the Quad toward a region protected and made prosperous in equal measure by strong and peaceful nations in the Indo-Pacific, said the State Department statement.Interestingly, the statement did not name China once although before embarking on his India-Bangladesh tour, he had described China as the “elephant in the room” and the US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien had said the time to explore solutions through dialogue with China is over.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-calls-for-enhanced-cooperation-in-quad-155703

To gather scientific evidence, medical examination of the accused has also been done,” he said.Under the NSA, an individual can be taken into preventive detention without a charge for up to 12 months if the authorities are satisfied that the person is a threat to national security or law and order.Jhansi’s Senior Superintendent of Police Dinesh Kumar P on Wednesday said barring the eight accused, no other name has cropped up in the case so far.“Anti-Romeo squads, along with police force, have been deployed at the polytechnic and other colleges,” he said.Meanwhile, the polytechnic principal said, “The hostel was closed and in this situation, the accused took advantage as no security personnel was deployed there. All of them have been rusticated.”Earlier on Wednesday, the SSP said, “Since, the crime spot was a bit away from the college building, nobody noticed it.”All accused were arrested by Monday night and they have been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the SSP said.He also added that it is a matter of probe as to how the students reached the hostel of the polytechnic despite it being closed.“During the probe, it was found that all accused are students of the government polytechnic. They also extorted Rs 3,000 from the girl by blackmailing her,” the SSP had said on Tuesday.Police said the girl had gone to meet a friend and they were near the college when the accused forcibly took her to the hostel. She said the accused also thrashed her friend when he tried to intervene. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rape-at-hostel-jhansi-admin-recommends-nsa-against-accused-155700
14-10-2020||New Delhi||Electricity generators banned in Delhi as anti-pollution measures come into force from Thursday||The Aam Aadmi Party Government has banned use of electricity generators, except those needed for essential or emergency services, in the national capital as anti-pollution measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) come into force from Thursday in the Delhi-NCR region.GRAP, which comes into effect in Delhi and its vicinity towns according to the severity of air pollution, was first notified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2017 for implementation through the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority. “Delhi Pollution Control Committee hereby bans the operation of electricity generator sets of all capacities, run on diesel, petrol or kerosene in Delhi with effect from October 15 till further orders, excluding those used for essential or emergency services,” an official order read.The essential services include health care facilities, elevators, railway services, Delhi Metro, airports and interstate bus terminals and the data centre run by the National Informatics Centre. The DPCC also directed power companies to ensure an uninterrupted power supply to the consumers.It also issued an order implementing EPCA’s directions to enforce GRAP from Thursday.The EPCA had earlier directed that large construction projects, including highways and metro, will have to provide undertakings to state pollution control boards/pollution control committees that they will assure adherence to the prescribed norms for dust management.“Industries, particularly in the Red and Orange category, will provide an undertaking that they will use only authorised fuel and will not operate without adequate pollution control measures,” it had said.Authorities categorise industries according to pollution index scores worked out based on the emissions, effluents, hazardous wastes generated and consumption of resources.Based on the relative scores, the industries are categorised as Red category if their score is more than or equal to 60 and Orange category if the score is between 41 and 59. Those having a score between 21 and40 and less than 20 come under Green and White categories respectively.The EPCA had also directed the states to ensure enforcement and full compliance of the action plan on the identified pollution hotspots through ground-level surveillance and night patrolling “to ensure zero-tolerance for all sources of pollution including waste burning and dust”.Controlling air pollution during winter will require greatly enhanced vigilance on the ground so that sources, such as industrial stacks and garbage dumping and use of illegal fuels, are checked and penalized, it had said.All technologies for dust management, including smog-guns, should be extensively used during this period.The measures under GRAP, which was first implemented in Delhi-NCR in 2017, include increasing bus and metro services, hiking parking fees and stopping the use of diesel generator sets when the air quality turns poor.When the situation turns “severe”, GRAP recommends closure of brick kilns, stone crushers and hot mix plants, sprinkling of water, frequent mechanised cleaning of roads and maximising power generation from natural gas.The measures to be followed in the “emergency” situation include stopping the entry of trucks in Delhi, ban on construction activities and introduction of the odd-even car rationing scheme. EPCA, however, had earlier told Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh that they “should try and avert the need to take other emergency measures for pollution control as the economy is already under stress post-lockdown. Therefore, our combined effort is to ensure that there is no further disruption”.

14-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Court grants bail to two accused, says no specific allegations against them||A Delhi court on Wednesday gave bail to two people in a case related to the communal violence in north east Delhi in February saying they were not named in the FIR nor are there any specific allegations against them.The court granted relief to Rashid Saifi and Mohd Shadab, whom prosecution claimed to be the relatives of former AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain, who was the main conspirator, and at whose instigation they actively participated in rioting in the area.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav granted bail to them on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 20,000 with one surety of like amount each in the case of looting, vandalising and torching a shop in Dayalpur area during the riots.“The applicants (Saifi and Shadab) have neither been named in the FIR nor there are any specific allegations against them. Admittedly, neither there is any CCTV footage nor any CDR location of the applicants available in the matter. There is no independent identification of applicants in the matter from any public witness,” the court said.According to prosecution, their alleged role in the crime came during the course of investigation and they were arrested and charge sheeted in the case.  The court said identification of Saifi and Shadab by beat Constable Gyan Singh was hardly of any consequence since it was unable to understand why he waited till March 3 to name the accused when he had categorically seen them indulging in riots on February 25.“Being a police official, what stopped him from reporting the matter then and there in the police station or to bring the same in the knowledge of higher police officers. This cast a serious doubt on the credibility of this witness,” it said in its order passed on October 13.The court directed the accused not to tamper with evidence, maintain peace and harmony in their locality and install “Aarogya Setu” app in their mobile phones.“Considering the fact that investigation in the matter is complete and charge sheet has already been filed; trial in the matter is likely to take long time; the applicants (Saifi and Shadab) cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter,” it said.During the hearing, advocate Dinesh Tiwari, appearing for Saifi and Shadab, said they were in judicial custody since April and there was no electronic evidence against them in the case.Tiwari further said they have also not been identified by any independent witness and Constable Singh was allegedly a “planted witness”.Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, opposed the bail pleas saying, Saifi and Shadab were relatives of former AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain, who was the main conspirator, and at his instigation they actively participated in rioting in the area.Prasad further argued although there may not be any independent evidence of identification of the accused in the case, they have been identified by be at Constable Gyan Singh.The public prosecutor said that though the charge sheet has been filed, the investigation of the case was still in progress and many persons who were part of the “riotous mob” needed to be identified and arrested.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-court-grants-bail-to-two-accused-says-no-specific-allegations-against-them-155693
14-10-2020||Jerusalem||India provides USD 1 million for Palestinian refugees||India on Wednesday contributed USD one million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East to support Palestinian refugees who have been facing extreme challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a move hailed by the UN body as "timely help".  The Government of India handed over the contribution cheque to the UN agency through its representative in Palestine, Sunil Kumar.United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has thanked India for its "timely help"."India has been a solid and consistent supporter of Palestinian refugees for decades. This contribution is even more significant as it comes at a critical time," Sami Mshasha, Director of Communications at UNRWA, told PTI."India is facing a difficult situation at home due to the pandemic and it has still not forgotten the Palestinian refugees and stepped in to help stabilise basic services, including education, health care, relief and social services for Palestinian refugees. I would like to thank the Government of India for its continued funding to UNRWA and its backing of Palestine refugees across the Middle East,” said Mshasha.Reiterating India's continued support for the UNRWA services, Kumar in a press release said, “On behalf of the Government of India, I would like to express my appreciation for the remarkable efforts carried out by the UNRWA. India shall continue supporting the agency's activities in providing vital services and necessary humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees”.During an Extraordinary Virtual Ministerial Pledging Conference for the UNRWA held on June 23, 2020, Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan had announced that India would contribute USD 10 million to the UNRWA over the next two years.India increased its annual financial contribution to the UNRWA from USD 1.25 million in 2016 to USD 5 million in 2018 and 2019. It had also contributed USD 2 million to the agency in May 2020 which brings the total contribution for this year to USD three million so far."The UNRWA has been facing a huge budgetary deficit and with an overwhelming majority of the 5.6 million refugees living under poverty line, the ongoing pandemic has broken the backbone of the basic infrastructure in the area they live. India's contribution seen in that background is timely and much appreciated," said Mshasha.India has also sent medicines and other supplies to the Palestinian National Authority to help in dealing with the COVID-19 situation.The UNRWA is facing an increased demand for services resulting from a growth in the number of registered Palestine refugees, the extent of their vulnerability and their deepening poverty.It is a United Nations agency established by the General Assembly in 1949 and mandated to provide assistance and protection to some 5.6 million Palestine refugees registered with the UNRWA across its five fields of operation.Its mission is to help Palestine refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank, including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip achieve their full human development potential, pending a just and lasting solution to their plight.The UNRWA services encompass education, healthcare, relief and social services, camp infrastructure and improvement, protection, and microfinance among Palestinian refugees.Under an India-Palestine development partnership, India is currently funding eight ongoing developmental projects worth 59 million US dollars, including building a 215-bed Super Specialty Hospital in Bethlehem, Information Technology Park, National Printing Press, Turathi-Women Empowerment Project, Diplomatic Training Institute and three schools in various governorates in Palestinian Territories.

14-10-2020||Kolkata||Assam to delete names from NRC||Anxiety has returned to haunt the religious and the linguistic minorities of Assam in the wake of a recent letter by Assam NRC Coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma asking deputy commissioners (DCs) and district registrars of citizen registration (DRCR) of various districts of Assam to delete the names of “ineligible” persons from the final NRC (National Registrar of Citizens).Sarma – who was handpicked by the BJP government in Assam for appointment as State NRC Coordinator ignoring frantic protests from Congress MP Abdul Khaleque – wrote to the DCs and DRCRs on Tuesday to submit a list of such persons who were not eligible for having their names in the NRC.According to Sarma, the DCs and DRCRs had earlier reported to him about some names of ineligible persons belonging to the categories of DF/DV/PFT (declared foreigner/doubtful voters/pending before foreigners’ tribunal) along with their descendants having found entry to the NRC.The NRC State Coordinator wrote that the “Registrar General of India” was yet to publish the final NRC.“The LRCR (local registrar of citizen registration) may at any time before the final publication of the NRC in the state may cause or direct to cause verification of names of such persons considered necessary,” Sarma wrote quoting the relevant rules.Sarma asked the DCs and DRCRs to write speaking orders for deletion of names of persons after ascertaining the identity of the person. The officials have been asked to ascertain the correct identity of the person thus deleted so that no ambiguity could arise in future.The DCs and DRCRs have been asked to submit a list of such persons who are not eligible for having their names in the NRC alongwith speaking order justifying reasons for each case for the necessary action of deletion of such names.The DCs and DRCRs were told that a software for this purpose would be rolled out soon.The State NRC Coordinator’s order may put some of the DCs and DRCRs also in quandary as the state government is known to have been unkind to officials who have failed to match the expectation of the government in terms of the number of “foreigners” bagged by them when entrusted the job under a different pretext.Incidentally, Clause 4(6) of the Schedule of the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens & Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, quoted by the NRC Coordinator in his letter also empowers the DRCR to include names of such persons in the NRC who might have been left out owing to some mistake. Sarma, it turns out, is interested only in deletion of names.Nineteen lakh people, mostly Bengali speaking Hindus and Muslims, have been left out from the final NRC of Assam published on August 31, 2019. Even those with minor flaws in documents like a surname was spelled differently in two different documents were not spared.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-to-delete-names-from-nrc-155689

Complaints have been lodged in Chennai, Kanjipuram, Chengalpet, Madurai, Coimbatore, Tirupur among other places,” he said.The official said while Kushboo has every right to politically take on her opponents, usage of terms that invoke a negative portrayal of disability was “unacceptable”.“Time and again people holding public offices tend to invoke such negative terms to tarnish the image of political opponents, lending them legitimacy. This cannot be tolerated. The National Platform for the Rights of the Disabled (NPRD) strongly condemns the insensitive remarks made by Kushboo,” he said.The country and people like Kushboo need to be reminded that such insults and humiliation are also prohibited by law, Muralidharan said.“Proceeding against high-profile people should act as a deterrent and would help in sending across the message that insult and humiliation of the disabled and their negative portrayal would not be tolerated,” he added.NPRD is an NGO working to create awareness about the rights of people with disabilities. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nprd-lodges-police-complaints-against-kushboo-over-remarks-against-disabled-155688
14-10-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Govt to import 1 lakh MT of medical oxygen to meet any shortage during winters||The Union Health Ministry has initiated the process of importing liquid oxygen as part of its preparedness to meet any unforeseen shortage during the winters when the country may witness an increase in COVID-19 cases leading to a rise in demand for oxygen.HLL Lifecare Limited, a public sector undertaking, has floated a global tender on Wednesday on behalf of the Health Ministry for procuring one lakh metric tonne of liquid oxygen.The oxygen is being procured for various central and state government hospitals. The entire exercise of importing and then distributing the medical oxygen is estimated to cost Rs 600-700 crore, official sources said.As on Tuesday, around 3.97 per cent of the COVID-19 patients were on oxygen support, 2.46 per cent were in ICU beds which are again with oxygen support and 0.40 per cent on ventilator support.In March, before the country went into a lockdown, the country had a manufacturing capacity of around 6,400 metric tonne of oxygen per day, of which around 1,000 metric tonne was being used for medical purposes daily while the rest was utilised by industries, sources said.“Industries have opened up following unlock procedures and as on September 30, the country’s daily capacity of oxygen production is around 7,000 metric tonne, of which around 3,094 metric tonne is being used for both COVID and non-COVID patients and is just enough to meet the demands,” a source said.“So this one lakh metric tonne of liquid oxygen which is being planned to be procured from foreign countries would create a one month buffer in case demand rises further during the winter season,” the source explained.The issue was discussed at a meeting held by the Cabinet Secretary on October 10, following which it was decided to import liquid oxygen.Even though India is witnessing a declining trend in daily new COVID-19 cases, experts fear that the upcoming festive season and following winter months may see a spike in coronavirus infections.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has urged people to observe COVID-19-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks, hand hygiene, maintaining respiratory etiquette and staying away from congregations, citing the possibility of increased novel coronavirus transmission during winters.“These viruses are known to thrive better in the cold weather and low humidity conditions. In view of these, it would not be wrong to assume that the winter season may see increased rates of transmission of the novel coronavirus in the Indian context too,” he said.In September, when cases were increasing, the Health Ministry had repeatedly advised states to ensure adequate oxygen availability in all healthcare facilities and unrestricted intra as well as inter-state movement of oxygen.States were also asked to ensure facility wise/hospital wise oxygen inventory management and advance planning for timely replenishment so that there are no stockouts.India’s COVID-19 caseload rose to 72,39,389 on Wednesday, while the death toll due to the disease was 1,10,586.

It has now been decided that in both the UTs, two third of the families in the rural areas will be covered under the scheme. Rs 520 crore have been allocated for the scheme, which will run for five years. Over 10.58 lakh family members will benefit from the scheme,” said Javadekar.There are 63 lakh self-help groups in the country, in which there are about seven crore women members and they have taken loans to the tune of Rs 3 lakh crore and they are repaying the loans. The NPA is only 2.3 per cent, which is almost negligible, said the Minister.“The outstanding loans amount is about Rs 1 lakh crore. The Modi government envisages to take the scheme to 10 crore women. In J&K and Ladakh, where not many women were getting registered, now 10 lakh women will be covered under the scheme,” he said.The National Rural Livelihood Mission aims to support rural women through self-help groups.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-decides-to-extend-national-rural-livelihood-mission-to-jk-ladakh-155675
14-10-2020||New Delhi||IMD operationalises advanced high-resolution air quality early warning system for Delhi||The India Meteorological Department has operationalised an advanced high-resolution air quality early warning system for the national capital as well as a separate one for the country, the Ministry of Earth Sciences said on Wednesday.A very high-resolution city scale model ENFUSER (ENvironmental information FUsion SERvice) for Delhi has been operationalised to identify the air pollution hotspots and pollution up to the street level, the MoES said.Pollution can be captured better with this model, VK Soni, head of the Environment Monitoring Research Centre of the IMD noted.Delhi has about 40 air quality monitoring systems.“We monitor traffic congestion at a 5-metre resolution, and land use and land cover at 30-metre resolution. This will better forecasting,” Soni added.The air quality forecast model System for Integrated Modelling of Atmospheric Composition (SILAM) for the country has been further improved by implementing global emission inventories CAMS-GLOB v2.1 supplemented with EDGAR v4.3.2 for coarse and mineral-fine anthropogenic particulate matter at 10 km resolution.“This will reduce the uncertainty in the forecast. Major uncertainty comes from sources of emission…we don’t know the actual sources, another uncertainty comes from meteorology,” Soni said.He explained that earlier, the chemistry transport model coupled with the meteorological forecast model was being used. So, whatever uncertainties regarding prediction were there in the latter model, also came with the former.SILAM and ENFUSER have been developed in technical collaboration with the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI).The speciality of the ENFUSER is the high utilisation of measurement data such as air quality observations, a detailed description of the road network, buildings, land-use information, high resolution satellite images, ground elevation and population data.“The ENFUSER natively taps into the operative IMD’s regional SILAM access point. The ENFUSER results are being evaluated with the satellite measurements and observations, and a model is found to capture the hotspots over Delhi very well,” the MoES said.The SILAM models have been extensively validated against observations over Indian region.Air Quality forecast model WRF-Chem has also been updated with high-resolution land use and land cover information to improve the air quality forecast.Now AQ early warning system also provides air quality forecast for Lucknow, Kanpur and Varanasi at 2 km resolution.The AQ forecast is also available for some other cities at 10 km resolution. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/imd-operationalises-advanced-high-resolution-air-quality-early-warning-system-for-delhi-155672

14-10-2020||New Delhi||Akbar's defamation case against Ramani: Trial vitiated if found that ACMM has no jurisdiction: Court||A Delhi court Wednesday said if it is found that the magisterial court trying the criminal defamation case filed by former union minister M J Akbar against journalist Priya Ramani for two years did not have the jurisdiction, “the entire trial, and not just the final argument, gets vitiated”.The observation came from the court which will pass an order on October 22 on whether to transfer a criminal defamation complaint from the court of Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) to another judge.An ACMM trying the case had on Tuesday sent the matter to Principal District and Sessions Judge seeking transfer of the matter to another court on the ground that his court was designated to hear cases filed against lawmakers.Principal District and Sessions Judge Sujata Kohli, who reserved the order, noted that the notification does not bar the Magistrate concerned from hearing matters other than those against MPs and MLAs.“However, the object behind the notification is that the cases against the lawmakers be decided expeditiously,” the judge said.She, however, pointed out that in case it is found that the magisterial court trying the matter did not have the jurisdiction, “the entire trial, and not just the final argument, gets vitiated”.“None of the counsel raised this point earlier. If we go behind the issue that the court has no jurisdiction, not just the final argument but the entire proceeding gets vitiated,” the judge said.During the arguments, senior advocate Geeta Luthra, appearing for Akbar, said that almost entire trial was over and only a few dates were remaining.“Great prejudiced would be caused if the matter the further delayed,” the counsel said.The counsel appearing for Ramani, however, said that the accused had no objection to any order passed by the court.While starting the argument Luthra told the court that a "joint request" was being made that the matter be sent back to the same trial court that has been hearing the case for over two years now.“We are making a joint request that the matter be sent back to Judge Pahuja... Two years back, the case was marked to his court. Both of us argued in detail. There is no point in re-arguing the final argument,” Luthra said.Ramani's counsel, Bhavook Chauhan, however, said that though it was supposed to be a joint statement, he had gone through the notification regarding the trial court's jurisdiction and would leave it to the wisdom of the District Judge to decide.ACMM Vishal Pahuja, who had started the final arguments in the case on February 7 this year, sent the matter to district and sessions judge, saying the case in hand was not filed against MP or MLA and needs to be transferred to the "Competent Court of Jurisdiction".Pahuja said his court (court of ACMM) was designated to try the cases filed against the lawmakers by a circular passed on February 23, 2018 and since this case was “not filed against MP/MLA”, he was marking the matter to Principal District and Sessions Judge to consider re-assigning the case to another Metropolitan Magistrate.Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani in March 2018.In the wake of #MeToo movement, Ramani in 2018 accused Akbar of sexual misconduct around 20 years ago when he was a journalist.Akbar resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018.Ramani had earlier told the court that she was “targeted selectively” through a criminal defamation complaint by Akbar, “to halt the avalanche of allegations of sexual misconduct that came out against him” in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2008.Akbar had said that Ramani defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as 'media's biggest predator' that harmed his reputation.He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during #MeToo campaign against him.Akbar had earlier told the court that the allegations made in an article in the 'Vogue' and the subsequent tweets were defamatory on the face of it as the complainant had deposed them to be false and imaginary and that an “immediate damage” was caused to him due to the “false” allegations by Ramani.Ramani had earlier told the court that her “disclosure” of alleged sexual harassment by Akbar has come at “a great personal cost” and she had “nothing to gain” from it.She had said her move would empower women to speak up and make them understand their rights at workplace.Several women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by M J Akbar him while they were working as journalists under him.He has termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.

14-10-2020||Dehradun||Schools for classes X, XII to reopen in Uttarakhand from November 1||Schools will reopen in Uttarakhand for classes X and XII on November 1 after their prolonged closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The decision was taken by the state Cabinet at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat here on Wednesday, government's spokesperson and Cabinet Minister Madan Kaushik said.The decision was taken on district magistrates' feedback after they consulted with district education officers and students' parents, he said.The schools, however, are being opened only for these two classes with strict instructions to schools to ensure compliance of the anti-COVID standard operating procedures of the Centre, including the mandatory wearing of face masks, social distancing and hand sanitising, besides other precautionary measures, Kaushik told reporters here.The decision on when to resume the rest of classes will depend on how things pan out during the first month of the reopening of schools, he said.Meanwhile, online classes will continue, he said.While issuing the SOP for Unlock-5 the Centre had left it to the states to take a call on the schedule of reopening schools after proper assessment of the COVID situation within their territories.Modifying its earlier decision to cut one day salary of all government functionaries and employees for a year because of the pandemic, the Cabinet exempted state government employees below the IAS and IPS-rank officers from the ambit of the decision.However, ministers, MLAs, IAS and IPS officers will continue to contribute their one-day salary towards the corona relief fund for a year as decided earlier.The relief was being provided to the junior state government employees as a gift for the festival season, he said.The Cabinet also decided to rename the Himalayan Garhwal University as AB Vajpayee Himalayan Garhwal University.

14-10-2020||Washington||US body on AI calls for creating India-US strategic tech alliance||The US should build a formal tech alliance with India that will help develop an overarching Indo-Pacific strategy focused on emerging technology, an independent federal commission on artificial intelligence has said.The newly-created National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence in its report on Tuesday said the Department of State and the Department of Defence should negotiate formal AI cooperation agreements with India, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Vietnam.In the report submitted to the Congress and President Donald Trump, the Commission underlined that America must build on the strength of its allies and partners to win the global technology competition and preserve free and open societies.This recommendation builds on growing support for the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, a strategic forum among the US, Australia, India, and Japan, and calls for formalising relationships with these and other nations in the Indo-Pacific region to focus on AI cooperation for defence and security purposes, it said.The Commission recommended a comprehensive strategic framework to marshal international multilateral and bilateral cooperation to achieve this goal.First, the US must expedite the responsible development and fielding of AI by NATO and member states and shape defence cooperation agreements with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific, it said.Second, the US must build a multilateral effort to advance the responsible use of AI, by leading a coalition of democracies to advance the responsible use of AI, further innovation, and strengthen diplomatic ties and improve coordination with private industry and international partners to ensure new emerging technology standards are based on technical considerations and best practices, not political manipulation, and address national security needs, it said.Third, the US must deepen its AI bilateral partnerships with free and open societies, it said.“It should pursue this through a formal tech alliance between the world's largest democracies – the US and India – and strategic dialogue between the world's largest economies – the US and the European Union – to address the challenges and opportunities presented by AI,” said the Commission.In its report, the Commission calls for the US to centre its Indo-Pacific relations around India with emerging tech as a key focal point; recognising the importance of India as the world's largest democracy; the growing geopolitical challenges faced by India; the shared commitment to freedom, democratic principles, and the rule of law; and the many shared interests of the two nations, including strong innovation and technical infrastructures.The Commission said that to implement a more robust policy towards India, the Department of State, in coordination with the Departments of Defence and Commerce, must lead the creation of a US-India Strategic Tech Alliance (UISTA).“The objective of UISTA will be to make India a focal point of US foreign policy in the region and an overarching Indo-Pacific strategy focused on emerging technology and India's increasingly important geopolitical role,” it said.The nations should engage in periodic high-level meetings to develop an overarching strategy on issues involving emerging technology and the Indo-Pacific region, it added.Through regular working groups, UISTA should develop and implement concrete, operational avenues for cooperation between the two nations - including advanced joint research and development projects around AI; talent exchanges and talent flow; a range of issues on innovation, including emerging technology investment and aligning export controls, investment screening, and intellectual property rights; development of AI for societal applications; and using AI to counter disinformation, it added.The Commission recommended that the Department of State, in partnership with India's Ministry of External Affairs, should establish UISTA to develop and implement a strategy for emerging technology and the Indo-Pacific region.The two countries should use an inaugural high-level meeting to develop an overarching strategy for the partnership and identify an agenda for concrete action to be pursued through working group meetings.Participation from the United States Government should also include the Departments of Defence, Energy, and Commerce, it said.According to the Commission, in recent years, India has redoubled its efforts to improve its AI infrastructure (including through key investments by US organisations), faces immediate threats to its territorial and cyberspace integrity from China and has been an active participant in the most promising new multilateral efforts around AI such as GPAI and is part of the emerging D10 coalition.“India boasts domestic technological expertise unlike any other and its citizens represent over 70 per cent of the H-1B visas issued annually by the US. Alignment between the two nations is clear and the potential to build on an already strong relationship is enormous,” the Commission said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-body-on-ai-calls-for-creating-india-us-strategic-tech-alliance-155643

14-10-2020||Washington||Indian economy will recover from coronavirus crisis with right policies: IMF official||The Indian economy, severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic, would be well placed to start recovering from the “horrible crisis” with the government making efforts on both the fiscal and monetary side in addition to putting in place structural elements, a top IMF official has said.The International Monetary Fund in its annual World Economic Outlook significantly downgrades India's growth for the fiscal year 2020 to minus 10.3 per cent.At the same time, IMF said that India is likely to bounce back with an impressive 8.8 per cent growth rate in 2021, but for this New Delhi needs to ramp up its efforts in various fields.In terms of what can be done going forward, clearly on the fiscal side, the IMF believes there is more that can be done to provide support to households and firms that have been affected by the pandemic, Malhar Shyam Nabar, Division Chief, Research Department, IMF, told reporters on Tuesday at a news conference here on the eve of the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank.He further said there is a need to tilt the composition of the fiscal support towards more of the direct spending and tax relief measures and to rely slightly less on the liquidity support measures, the credit guarantees, which are clearly important to support the provision of credit in the economy.“But if you look at the approach that was taken, there was more of an emphasis on that type of measure. We think that there is room to recalibrate and to provide more direct relief and spending support, which could have a first order impact on preventing even worse outcomes, Nabar said.On the monetary policy side, the RBI had come in very aggressively early on, he said. "It has paused recently with its interest rate cuts, looking through this inflation, the spike in inflation that they have had recently, but we believe there is more that the RBI can do, too, in terms of there is room to cut if needed, and we think that should be done once this inflation spike is more under control," he added.“And together with these efforts, both on the fiscal side and the monetary side, we think that would put India on a path to recovery going forward,” Nabar said.There has also been some efforts recently on the structural side to improve medium-term growth prospects, he said.“We have had progress on labour reform bills and the farm bills. We think that this will advance their structural reform agenda in an important way, remove supply-side constraints in the agricultural sector and in the labour market, also allow for a better matching of workers with firms, provide firms with a little bit more flexibility in terms of hiring options, but at the same time also provide more social security and safety net options for workers as well,” he said in response to a question.“So, with those structural elements in place as well to reinforce the cyclical support, the Indian economy would be well-placed to start recovering from this horrible crisis that it is experiencing right now,” Nabar said.

14-10-2020||New Delhi||Hathras case: Fresh PIL in SC seeks case under SC/ST Act against cops, officials & probe by STF||A fresh PIL has been filed in the Supreme Court in the Hathras incident, in which a Dalit girl was allegedly raped and died of injuries, seeking registration of a criminal case under SC/ST Act against police personnel, medical staff and other government officials involved in the case as also a probe by a special task force (STF).Maharashtra based Dalit rights activist Chetan Janardhan Kamble said he was constrained to file the PIL after some glaring facts were revealed regarding “the state support for manipulating and destroying evidence in the Hathras gang-rape and murder case”, from the affidavit filed by the Uttar Pradesh government in the top court in another PIL.“The issues regarding cover-up in medical reports prepared by government hospitals and cremation of the body by the police personnel in the face of objections of the family of the victim in order to protect the accused persons, which were being speculated in media reports have now been revealed through the affidavit in reply and documents annexed thereto by the state of UP,” said the plea, which is likely to be taken up for hearing on October 15. The PIL, filed through advocate Vipin Nair, said the incident has shocked the conscience of the society at large and “how the State machinery is using all efforts to ensure that the accused remain well-shielded, including manipulation and destruction of the evidence, for reasons best known to it”.“The facts clearly indicate the involvement and complicity of certain UP State police and officials of the state government machinery in manipulation and destruction of evidence and shielding the accused in respect of the subject crime,” it said.On October 6, terming as "shocking” and “horrible" the Hathras incident, the top court had said it would ensure a “smooth” investigation and sought Uttar Pradesh government's reply on how the witnesses were being protected in the case in which a Dalit girl was allegedly brutally raped and died of injuries.The Uttar Pradesh government, which earlier filed an affidavit in the case, urged the top court to order CBI probe into the incident saying an innocent life has been lost and the central agency may be ordered to conduct the probe under the supervision of the apex court itself.The Centre has accepted the recommendation of the UP government for CBI investigation in the case after which the probe agency has registered a fresh case.The 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital during treatment. The victim was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on September 30.Her family alleged they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites.Local police officers, however, said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".Several PILs and intervention applications have been filed by individuals, NGOs and lawyers in the top court seeking a probe by an independent agency.The fresh PIL further alleged that the government hospital at Aligarh did not vaginal swabs and body smears of the victim or collected drop sheet after a change of clothes, despite finding torn clothes and bleeding on under-garments, and then waited for testing for semen till after eight days from the incident when no forensic evidence in that regard would be found.It said, “the very fact that even before the investigation is complete, certain high-ranking police officials and government officials have ruled out the possibility of rape, and made public statements regarding the same, indicates a clear nexus between the state police and the accused”.The “bizarre and barbaric manner” in which the body of the victim was stealthily cremated in the dead of the night by the police officials' smacks of them being involved in suppressing the crime rather than investigating it, it added.“This unpardonable crime by the state police and other government instrumentality, which denied the family of the victim even the basic right to perform last rites on the body of the victim is nothing but depravity of the soul”, it said, adding no law and order problem could justify the destruction of evidence.The plea sought direction for probe of the case by the independent special task force (STF) excluding the CBI and UP state police for offences under IPC and provisions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, against the police officials, hospital staff and medical officers and other government officials It said that the STF constituted should be of impeachable integrity and having experience of a criminal investigation, to be appointed by and monitored by this Court.The plea also sought a direction to Centre and UP government to deposit all the evidence including the video-recordings of the statements of the victim and her relatives on September 14 and 19, as well as the medico-legal evidence collected at the time of conducting the autopsy by Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi for examination by an independent forensic laboratory for relevant markers.It said that direction should also be issued for granting protection by Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) to the witnesses and members and relatives of the family of the victim, pending investigation and trial. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hathras-case-fresh-pil-in-sc-seeks-case-under-sc-st-act-against-cops-officials-probe-by-stf-155605

The Ministry was not kept in the loop so now I will talk to concerned specialists  The questions he has raised are: Whether the AIIMS team did a postmortem on the body of Sushant or was only forming an opinion about the postmortem report done already by the doctors of Cooper Hospital; Was Dr Sudhir Gupta advised by higher authorities to give interviews before the AIIMS Special team report was submitted; did the AIIMS team examine the evidence of destruction, the postmortem by the doctors at Cooper Hospital, and the non-sealing of the scene of the crime by the Mumbai Police; was their insufficient material from a forensic medical point of view for this AIIMS team taking a definite opinion on a cause of death and will the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare consider sending the matter to the Medical Board of the Ministry.His tweet comes days after the AIIMS panel ruled out the possibility of murder in Sushant's case. Swamy has been leading a campaign to get justice for actor Sushant, who was found dead on June 14.An initial probe by Mumbai Police concluded the actor had committed suicide. The case is subsequently being handled by CBI, with NCB and ED joining the investigation. — With IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-was-the-orange-juice-glass-not-preserved-in-sushant-rajput-death-case-asks-bjp-mp-subramanian-swamy-155598

It also opposed border infrastructure development, including the recent opening of bridges, by India.A joint readout today on the India-China commanders’ meeting held on Monday stated: “Both sides agreed to… arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement as early as possible.” However, sources said that no date or timeline had been set for any such disengagement. In Beijing on Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, while answering questions at a press conference, said: “China doesn’t recognise the so-called ‘Ladakh Union Territory’ illegally set up by India or ‘Arunachal Pradesh’, and opposes infrastructure-building aimed at military contention in disputed border areas.”“The Indian side has been stepping up military deployment along the border with China. This is the root cause of tensions,” Zhao said while responding to a question on India opening 44 new bridges.Military commanders of the two countries had met yesterday at Chushul along the LAC for a marathon 10-hour meeting.

14-10-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Governor, CM spar over reopening of shrines||Maharashtra Governor BS Koshyari and CM Uddhav Thackeray engaged in a bitter exchange of words over reopening of places of worship in the state amid the Covid-19 pandemic with “secularism” and “Hindutva” figuring prominently in their discourse.Has Uddhav suddenly turned secular? It is ironical that while the state govt permitted opening of restaurants and beaches, our gods and goddesses have been condemned to stay in lockdown — BS Koshyari, Governor The spat started after Koshyari wrote a letter to the CM on Monday, saying, “It is ironical that the state government has permitted opening of bars, restaurants and beaches, but our gods and goddesses have been condemned to stay in the lockdown.”Thackeray today wrote to the Governor, saying the government will consider his request. The CM said a decision on reopening shrines, a demand being vociferously made by the BJP, would be taken after careful consideration of the Covid-19 situation in the state.Does Hindutva mean merely reopening religious places? Isn’t secularism a key component of the Constitution by which you swore while taking oath as the state Governor — Uddhav Thackeray, Maharashtra Chief MinisterKoshyari had said he has received three representations from delegations demanding that religious places be reopened. Thackeray pointed out the “coincidence” that all three letters were from BJP supporters.In the letter to the CM, whose Shiv Sena is wedded to Hindutva, Koshyari asked, “Have you suddenly turned secular, the term you hated?” “While considering people’s beliefs, it is also important to take care of their lives and it is wrong to impose and lift lockdown suddenly,” the CM wrote. — PTIIntemperate language in letter: Pawar to Prime MinisterMumbai: NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday wrote to PM Narendra Modi, complaining about the “intemperate language” used by M’rashtra Governor BS Koshyari in a letter to the CM. “I am sure he too would have noticed the intemperate language that has been used and this language does not behove well for a person who holds a constitutional position,” he added.
