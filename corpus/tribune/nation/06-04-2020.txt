Nobody had asked them to burst firecrackers. However, if they do, what is the harm in it? This is an expression of happiness.“I want to ask the environmentalists who said that the air quality deteriorated.  What about the entire year when the pollution is at its peak? I would request everybody not to make an issue out of this incident,” Ghosh said here.Senior TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee had on Sunday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s lights-out call and said India was the first-ever nation to celebrate a pandemic.“With the firecrackers, fancy diyas & sky lanterns, we have become the first-ever Nation to celebrate a pandemic #COVID19.  I am also contemplating how many actually followed the norms of #lockdown to gear up for this. What was being preached: self-isolation or self-destruction? (sic)” he wrote on his Twitter handle. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nothing-wrong-with-people-bursting-firecrackers-during-blackout-bengal-bjp-chief-66489
06-04-2020||Kolkata||Mamata accuses BJP IT cell of spreading fake news on Bengal corona cases||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday slammed the BJP’s IT cell for allegedly spreading fake news against the state’s health department over COVID-19 cases and asked it to refrain from ‘petty politics’ in the time of crisis.Her comments came in the backdrop of BJPs IT cell chief Amit Malviya’s tweet accusing the West Bengal Government of hiding coronavirus data. She, however, did not name the BJP or Malviya.Banerjee also announced the formation of a ‘Global Advisory Board’, a policy-making body which will aid the state government in preparing a roadmap for COVID-19 response in Bengal.Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee and other eminent personalities from the state will be members of the board which will advise the chief minister in reviving the economy after the lockdown is revoked, she said.“This is the time to serve the people. But I have noticed that a political party’s IT cell is using fake news to malign West Bengal’s health department. Our doctors and health staff are doing their best to fight the disease. This is not the time for petty politics. We never pointed at the lacunas of the Central government in dealing with the crisis,” she told a press conference here.West Bengal currently has 61 active COVID-19 cases.“They may be more interested in politics by clanging utensils and bursting crackers, but we are not,” she said, apparently targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his campaigns urging people to applaud corona fighters and display their collective resolve to defeat the deadly virus.The economy is also facing a crisis due to the lockdown and a roadmap is needed to revive it once it is withdrawn, the chief minister said, adding: “After notebandi (demonetisation), now it is gharbandi (home quarantine).”          “To chalk out a future roadmap on how to revive the economy and help the downtrodden and develop health infrastructure, we have formed a Global Advisory Board to form the COVID-19 response policy in the state. Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Bandhopadhyay will be there in the committee along with those who have made a mark in the world,” she said.Speaking at another programme, Banerjee said the economist has given his consent to be associated with the board.The chief minister asked people to remain positive as a large number of people used to get sick because of malaria and dengue in the past but now these diseases are under control.“Similar is the trend for corona. Don’t think in a negative way. Always be positive. Medicines are working and there is no dearth of medicines,” she said.Banerjee said her government will not open tea gardens of the state “immediately” as per the guidelines of the Central government and would review the situation before taking a decision about it.“Eleven members of a family in Kalimpong (in Darjeeling district) have been infected with COVID-19. People in tea gardens are scared. (The state has) borders with Assam, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. I think we should wait for a few more days (before reopening the tea gardens,” she said.

Some of these interventions are being actively considered to scale-up testing capacity to 1 lakh tests/day in upcoming months,” it said.As on April 6 at 3.45 pm, ICMR has tested 96, 264 samples of which 3,718 were found positive for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 136 government laboratories and 56 private laboratories have been made functional and are currently engaged in the testing procedure. These laboratories have testing capacity of 18,000 tests per day, the ICMR statement said.In addition to this, two high throughput machine Cobass 6800 have been made functional which can test 1,400 samples at a time.The ICMR has prepared a data portal for streamlining the data collection from all the laboratories on a real-time basis, it said.Besides, the ICMR has procured 10 lakh Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) kits used for diagnosis and seven depots have been established for uninterrupted supply of reagents across the nation for efficient distribution to government testing laboratories.“ICMR has a constant vigil on the national testing strategy in line with the current trend of the outbreak. Till now, 19 non-US FDA EUA/CE IVD real-time-PCR kits have been validated of which have been recommended based on 100% concordance with positive and negative samples,” the body said, adding the recommendations have been shared with the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation(CDSCO) for taking it forward.Apart from this, antibody-based tests have also been made available for sero-surveillance.“However, antibody tests are not suitable to diagnose live COVID-19 infections,” it said adding it has released advisory to start rapid antibody based blood test for COVID-19 as a strategy for areas reporting clusters (containment zone) and in large migration gatherings/evacuees centres.ICMR has validated and recommended seven such test kits for use.“ICMR has validated and recommended TruenatTM beta CoV test on TruelabTM workstation as a screening test.“All positives through this platform will need to be reconfirmed by confirmatory assays for SARS-CoV-2. All negatives may not be processed further. Currently, there are nearly 300 TruelabTM workstation already deployed in country and it will be utilized for the testing,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-icmr-planning-to-scale-up-testing-capacity-to-1-lakh-tests-per-day-66487

06-04-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus: Cong welcomes decision to cut MPs’ salaries, calls for review of MPLAD suspension||The Congress on Monday welcomed the government’s decision to cut MPs’ salaries to fight the battle against coronavirus, but said suspending MPLADs will undermine the role of an MP and called for its review.“Dear PM, INC supports the salary cut for MPs. Please note that MPLAD is meant to execute developmental works in the constituency. Suspending it is a huge disservice to the constituents and will undermine the role and functions of MP,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said on Twitter.Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel welcomed the decision but suggested cutting down on non-COVID-19 publicity costs to enable the Central government to save money.“As a Member of Parliament, I welcome the government’s decision to cut salaries of MPs. In this difficult time, this is the least we can do to help fellow citizens,” Patel said on Twitter.“Apart from cutting salaries of MPs and ministers, the central government can save more than Rs 20,000 crore by scrapping the central vista redevelopment project & cutting down on non-COVID-19 publicity expenses,” he also said.Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said suspending the MPLADS is an overstretch and needs to be restored, saying a knee jerk reaction much like the lockdown will hurt poor the most.“Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi - As an MP who represents a predominately rural constituency I fully support the 30 pc cut in my salary. However the suspension of MPLADS is a bit of an overstretch,” he said.Tewari said at this time of grave humanitarian distress that will get only worse in the months ahead.He noted that MPLADS is a targeted and nimble instrument to customise micro level interventions to alleviate distress.“I think MPLAD Funds need to be restored. Please re-think it once again. It is a knee jerk reaction much like the lockdown at a 4-hour notice. It will hurt poor most,” the Congress MP from Punjab said.Another Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said the Centre’s decision to cut salaries and pensions of MPs is welcome.“It’s a good way for us to show solidarity with people suffering across the country. But the ordinance ending MPLADS funds for two years and pooling them into a consolidated fund run by the central government is problematic,” he said.Tharoor said MPLADS is the only means for an MP to direct development resources to his constituency.An order to earmark all MPLAD spending for COVID-19 related measures would have been okay.“I used mine to get urgently-needed rapid test kits and PPE to Thiruvananthapuram’s health workers,” he tweeted.Citing examples of disproportionate relief, he said the Centre has allocated Rs 157 crore of Disaster Response Mitigation Funds to Kerala, which has 314 COVID-19 cases, while Gujarat, with only 122 cases, gets Rs 662 crore.“Will this kind of imbalance also affect the reallocation of MPLADS funds,” he asked.“In order to avoid such injustice, it’s essential that MPLADS money continues to be spent constituency-wise. I urge the government to revise this decision by allowing MPs to earmark these funds for COVID-19 related expenditure to meet local needs and benefit the vulnerable. It’s their job,” Tharoor said in another tweet.The Union Cabinet in its meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved an ordinance to bring a 30 per cent cut in salaries and pensions of MPs for a year starting April 1.The money will go to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI), Union minister Prakash Javadekar had said.All the revenue received by the government by way of taxes like income tax, central excise, customs and other receipts flowing to the government are credited into the CFI.All government expenditure is incurred from this fund and no amount can be withdrawn from the CFI without authorisation from Parliament.The Cabinet also approved temporary suspension of the MPLAD (Member of Parliament Local Area Development) fund scheme during financial years 2020-21 and 2021-22, and the amount will be used for managing health and adverse impact of outbreak of COVID-19 in the country, he had said.

The test lasts about 20 minutes, and the area is sealed off until it is done.“The vehicle of the patient will be parked at a distance, windows will be rolled down, and doctors will collect samples. The patient has been instructed only to roll down their windows at the time of the test,” Dang said.A drive-through test will prevent the spread of infection as well as serve to protect the medical staff.The test, the first-of-its-kind initiative in kind, is inspired by similar models in South Korea---a nation that has been praised for its management of the deadly virus.“There are many people who live in joint families. We have seen people getting uncomfortable when healthcare professionals visit them. For them, the drive-through test is an alternative,” Dang said. The test will cost Rs 4,500.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-lab-starts-drive-through-test-for-coronavirus-66474
06-04-2020||New Delhi||India considering requests from world leaders for supply of anti-malaria drug in fight against COVID-19||India is considering requests to Prime Minister Narendra Modi from several world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, for the supply of anti-malaria drug hydroxylchloroquine which New Delhi had banned for exports just last week.In fact, India has even stopped the export of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) which is said to help patients fight Covid infection.Apart from Trump who said he would appreciate it if India released the amounts US companies have ordered, Israel President Benjamin Netanyahu made a direct reference to India’s export ban by hoping it would improve pharmaceutical supplies.Other world leaders in their conversations with PM Modi are understood to have couched the need to keep global supply chains of anti-Covid going in indirect language.India has already permitted the use of hydroxychloroquine by medical and health care workers treating Covid patients and that is why it wants to preserve enough stocks of the drug to deal with a surge that has been predicted in the coming week.India had cancelled the exports on the plea that most of the Indian formulation makers are dependent on Chinese manufacturers but this plea is no longer valid after Beijing reported that its plants are back to the original production levels.In India, the main API makers for this drug are Ipca Laboratories and Zydus Cadila and in its desperation to source the drug, the US has reportedly informed India that it will be willing to overlook a three-year ban by the US Federal Drug Authority in case of one of the companies.The FDA has approved the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine with the approval at the urging of Trump after a few studies showed a correlation between its application and the improved health of some patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-considering-requests-from-world-leaders-for-supply-of-anti-malaria-drug-in-fight-against-covid-19-66472
06-04-2020||New Delhi||India between Stage 2 and 3 of COVID pandemic: Health Ministry||India is between Stage 2 and 3 of coronavirus pandemic with large number of cases being found in particular areas, the Union Health Ministry said on Monday concurring with the AIIMS Director’s remarks that localised community transmission is being observed in some pockets of the country.   AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria, who is also a member of a Task Force on COVID-19, on Monday reportedly said “localised community transmission” has been seen in some pockets and that India is between Stage 2 (local transmission) and Stage 3.He had clarified that the most of India is currently at Stage 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic.Asked about Guleria’s remarks, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health Lav Agarwal said, “What the AIIMS Director has said is not in variance with what we have been explaining to you.”Explaining further, Agarwal said that they go for a cluster containment strategy when limited cases are reported from a particular area while the government’s action and intervention gets intensified when larger number of cases are reported.“We tell you every time that if there will be a community transmission we will be the first one to tell you so that everyone gets alert. If we go by the wordings (of AIIMS Director), he said localised community transmission, which implies larger number of cases are being found in a particular area,” the official said.“We are in between Stage 2 and 3 and that implies that our efforts and actions should be focused on ensuring we do not shift to stage 3,” the joint secretary said, adding there are clear defined strategies for containment in areas reporting larger number of cases and the government was working according to that.In Stage 2, disease transmission is limited to those with travel history to affected countries or those in contact with the infected persons.Community transmission or Stage 3 means a patient was infected though he had no known contact with another confirmed case of COVID-19 or travelled from a country affected by the pandemic.

06-04-2020||New Delhi||India not out of woods; needs to exponentially ramp up Covid tests: Experts||An “exponential” ramping up of coronavirus testing is required to gauge the actual impact of the 21-day nation-wide lockdown, health experts said on Monday as India nears the final week of the unprecedented measure.The experts agreed that the lockdown has helped in slowing down spread of the virus but insisted that the situation has not reached a plateau and that there was an urgent need to upgrade healthcare facilities to deal with the crisis.Government officials involved in strategising India’s approach to contain the pandemic said the overall social distancing model adopted by the country helped in checking spread of the virus compared to many developed countries, including the US which reported 3,30,000 cases.India went under a nationwide lockdown from midnight of March 24 to combat the pandemic.“Because of the lockdown and our efforts to promote social distancing, cases were being reported but there was no sharp rise,” says Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry Lav Agarwal.However, experts said India is still not out of the woods and large scale testing alone can make the overall picture clear.“There is a need to scale up testing exponentially if we want the lockdown to work,” says Ramanan Laxminarayan, Director and Fellow at the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy. Arvind Kumar, renowned lung surgeon at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said India is into stage three of the coronavirus infection which is the community transmission stage.“We are into stage three now. But stage three is a broad spectrum, so not just hundreds of thousands of cases constitute community transmission stage. There have been many cases reported with no travel history or contacts with affected people,” he said.Asked to compare the growth of the cases in India vis-a-vis other countries like the US and Italy, Kumar said the comparison was not valid.“I do not think there can be a comparison. In India, the cases and deaths are rising. We are on the ascending curve and that too in a lockdown. We have to be very careful,” he said.Kumar also cautioned against completely lifting the restrictions, saying “if we relax the lockdown while cases are rising, it will be an explosion of cases.”“The lockdown should only be lifted when the number of cases starts dropping, which is not happening right now,” he added.Laxminarayan favoured adopting the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing model, also known as pooled sampling to identify infected people in a population.The use of a pooled testing strategy could reduce the time, cost and resources required while identifying infected people in a population and estimating the infection rate, he said.This would allow identification of community clusters for targeted public health interventions, Laxminarayan said.Dr Navin Dang, founder Director of Dr Dangs Lab, said the entire purpose of the lockdown would be defeated if testing is not ramped up.“As we are gradually seeing the cases increase, we need to ramp up our testing capacity by increasing the number of centres performing the real PCR tests both in the government and private sector without which the outcome of the lockdown cannot be determined,” he said.India’s apex medical research body ICMR has already issued guidelines to roll out a rapid antibody test to detect coronavirus infection. The test works on blood samples instead of nasal swabs.“Overall testing for COVID-19 using real-time PCR is increasing and we will be approaching full capacity in near future. At the same time, we are expecting delivery of Rapid Test kits (blood based) for use in response to COVID-19 situation,” ICMR DG Balram Bhargava said in a letter to health secretary Preeti Sudan few days back.The results of the antibody tests are available within 15-30 minutes.The government’s primary focus has been places from where a number of cases are being reported, large gatherings and evacuation centres.Another focus area for rapid testing is patients suffering from influenza like illness (ILI) with an objective to use it as a more effective monitoring tool in these areas.“These will be our criteria for distributing the kits once we get the supply,” Agarwal had said on Sunday.Dr K K Aggarwal, president of the Confederation of Medical Association of Asia and Oceania (CMAAO) and former IMA president, said the outcome of the lockdown would be determined by the testing.“We need to intensify the testing so that those who are positive by now can be quarantined for another 14 days,” he said.Kumar said more tests need to be conducted, and more and more isolation and containment strategies need to be worked out to contain the spread of the infection.Another expert, who did not wish to be named, said the biggest problem is that health being a state subject, different states are following different advisories in terms of containment plan and testing strategies and this is creating confusion.“It should be India without borders when it comes to dealing with such a calamity and uniform testing protocols should be implemented all across the country,” the expert said.With the final week of the lockdown approaching, the government has come out with a containment plan as clusters posing high risk of further spread of COVID-19 cases have emerged in several states like Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana as also Delhi and Ladakh.The cluster containment strategy would be to restrict the disease within a defined geographic area by early detection of cases, breaking the chain of transmission and thus preventing its spread to new areas.A health ministry official said India would be following a strategic approach in dealing with a variety of cases, including travel-related cases, infection arising out of local transmission as well as for large-scale outbreak.India has reported a total of 4,067 positive cases of coronavirus and 106 deaths, according to the Union Health Ministry.A PTI tally of figures reported by states directly showed at least 126 deaths across the country, while the confirmed cases reached 4,111.There has been a lag in the Union Health Ministry figures, compared to the numbers announced by different states, which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states.Globally, the virus has infected more than 1.27 million people and killed over 69,000. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-not-out-of-woods-needs-to-exponentially-ramp-up-covid-tests-experts-66462
06-04-2020||New Delhi||5 Haryana villages sealed over Nizamuddin event: MHA||More than 25,500 Tablighi Jamaat members and their contacts have been quarantined in the country till now after the Union and state governments conducted a “mega operation” to identify them, a senior Union Home Ministry official said on Monday.During the daily briefing, Joint Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava told reporters that five villages in Haryana have been sealed and the residents have been quarantined as “foreign members” of this Islamic organisation had stayed there.She added that 1,750 foreign-based members of the Jamaat, out of the total 2,083, have been blacklisted till now by the Indian government.These people and their contacts were identified and quarantined after the Union government and states conducted a “mega operation”, she said.Action against Tablighi Jamaat members was taken after over 2,300 activists were found to be living at its headquarters in Nizamuddin West in Delhi last week, despite the 21-day nationwide lockdown imposed to check the spread of the coronavirus.At least 9,000 people participated in the religious congregation in Nizamuddin last month, after which many of the attendees travelled to various parts of the country. Srivastava said Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla has written to all the states and Union Territories on Monday asking them to ensure that the supply chain of medical oxygen, critical for treatment of COVID-19 affected people, should go on smoothly and these directions should be “implemented strictly” while following norms of social distancing and proper hygiene.“As you know, medical oxygen is a very critical item for COVID-19. It is very essential to keep its proper supply and stock in the entire country. This is also declared an essential item in both national and WHO list and its production, manufacturing and the entire chain is exempted from lockdown measures.”       “To reiterate this, the home secretary has again written to state governments and UTs today and has told them about the importance of medical oxygen and has directed that its entire supply chain should be properly monitored.” the officer said.Updating about the ongoing lockdown situation, Srivastava said the state governments are enforcing the lockdown with promptness and essential goods and services are moving satisfactorily in the country and the Centre was regularly monitoring the situation with states.“We are hopeful that with the enforcement of these measures we will be able to effectively enforce the lockdown and break the COVID-19 chain,” she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/5-haryana-villages-sealed-over-nizamuddin-event-mha-66460
06-04-2020||---||Central relief from credit crunch to states, corporates||New Delhi, April 6The Government is considering further relaxations to cash-strapped state governments as well as corporates by easing the credit crunch they are suffering from.Both relaxations – increasing the borrowing limit for states and rescheduling the timeline for non-performing assets (NPAs) – are under deliberation within the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Finance Ministry as these will come with an onerous set of conditions to prevent their misuse.Of great interest to state governments is the move to allow them to borrow half of their credit limit for the entire fiscal 2020-21 within the month of April itself. Last week, the RBI hiked the way and means advance for states without waiting for a committee report while the Finance Ministry released over Rs 17,000 crore to states to help them tide over the economic crunch due Covid.The RBI in consultations with the Finance Ministry is working out a detailed table to provide relaxation in the delinquency period for classification of NPAs from the present 90 days. Since the requirements are different due to the varying level of stress on corporates, detailed consultations are required not just to prevent abuse but also ensure the medicine does not worsen the cure.Basically the purpose is that a sliding scale ensures corporates take a pick and also that loans are not classified as NPAs after 90 days, as is the current norm. This means that during the relief period, accounts will not be classified as a ‘stressed asset’ either under the Special Mention Accounts (SMA)-1 (overdue between 31 and 60 days) or SMA-2 accounts (loan repayments overdue with delay of 61-90 days).In the second move, the Centre recognised its inability to pay all the dues to states by way of devolution, goods and services tax compensation by giving them permission to borrow up to 50 per cent of their borrowing ceiling for the current fiscal. Consultations on this issue are being held between the states and RBI in this regard.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/central-relief-from-credit-crunch-to-states-corporates-66458

Government would provide all possible help to farmers in the harvesting season,” Modi said and suggested use of technology and encouraging exploration of innovative solutions in agriculture. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prepare-graded-plan-to-open-depts-in-non-hotspots-of-covid-19-pm-to-ministers-66456

06-04-2020||New Delhi||SC issues guidelines for hearings through video-conferencing across courts during Covid-19 pandemic||The Supreme Court on Monday passed a slew of directions for all courts across the country to extensively use video-conferencing for judicial proceedings saying congregation of lawyers and litigants must be suspended to maintain social distancing amid coronavirus pandemic.The top court, which has restricted its functioning and is conducting hearing through video-conferencing of extremely urgent matters during the lockdown period since March 25, exercised its plenary power under Article 142 of the Constitution to direct all the high courts to frame a mechanism for use of technology during the pandemic.Stressing that "technology is here to stay", a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde said recent outbreak of COVID-19 had necessitated social distancing and it is necessary to ensure that court premises did not contribute to the spread of coronavirus.The top court has taken suo motu cognizance of a letter written by senior advocate and former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Vikas Singh, who has suggested measures for use of technology for conducting hearings in the courts.The bench, also comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and L Nageswara Rao, directed that all courts would maintain helpline for grievances regarding video feed during and immediately after the hearing and they must make appropriate arrangements for litigants, who do not have access to such facilities.The apex court made it clear that no evidence would be recorded via video-conferencing and if recording of evidence is must in the courts, then the concerned judge would ensure that distance is maintained inside the courtroom.It said courts would have the power for restricted entry for the proceedings and to adjourn the hearing, if crowd cannot be managed.The bench said no presiding officer would restrict the entry of parties to the case unless they are having any health problem.It clarified that these directions have been issued to ensure that the judiciary rises to face this unique challenge of COVID-19 pandemic and these directives would remain in place till further orders.The bench said that to ensure continuous functioning of courts, every stakeholder is expected to coordinate during this "unprecedented and extraordinary" outbreak of COVID-19.There is a need to follow social distancing guidelines while maintaining constitutional role, the bench said, adding that "all hearing in congregation must necessarily be suspended".It observed that technology had facilitated accessibility and connectivity and Indian courts had been proactive in harnessing technology.The bench said it is "not a matter of discretion but of duty" to ensure that  court premises do not contribute to the spread of virus and courts must take all measures to ensure guidelines on social distancing and public health are followed.The top court asked the department of justice and National Informatics Centre (NIC) to take note of the problems which the apex court had faced on April 3, when there was connectivity issue during court hearing through video-conferencing.The apex court, which adjourned the matter for four weeks, asked its secretary general, registrar general of all the high courts and DG of NIC to coordinate on this issue and observed, “This cannot be seen as a temporary issue. Technology is here to stay.” Singh told the bench that there is a possibility that lockdown might end on April 15 but the apex court would have to consider how the courts would function post lockdown. He said there is a need to see how litigants and lawyers appear before the court and there is a need to take a call on creating a system, which would work post lockdown."We will not hear this till an announcement from government on the lockdown is made. If the lockdown is lifted, we will hear the matter, if it is not lifted, we will see what can be done," the bench said.Attorney General K K Venugopal told the bench that the issue which arises is as to whether we are having the most efficient system which can be accessed by lawyers across the country.Venugopal said NIC must look into the aspect as to which is the most efficient and cheap application that could be used by all lawyers across the country.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench that this is the best solution under these circumstances and though it might not be a suitable mode for long-drawn hearing, it would be a solution for short hearings.The Director General of NIC, who was present for the hearing, told the bench that three things are required for video-conferencing -- good broadband connection, good devices and conduct of people, where if one person is speaking then others must put the device on mute.Last week, Justice Chandrachud, who is also the chairperson of the Supreme Court E-committee, had on April 3 held a meeting through video-conferencing with high court judges heading such committees to ensure urgent matters are heard promptly and litigants are not required to come to court during the lockdown period.

There were apprehensions about the janata curfew which, I believe, was like testing the waters. Society responded very well to the leadeship and cooperated with it," he said.The senior Sangh leader also recounted the work done by two lakh RSS cadres at 26,000 places in the country to support as many as 25.5 lakh families.Responding to the criticism regarding the migrant labourers, he said to help them is the responsibility of the entire society and not just the government. "These are unprecedented circumstances, we have to first come out of it," said Vaidya.  Sangh cadres are supporting tribals, nomads, beggars outside religious places that are now shut and also providing fodder to animals and food to monkeys in these places, he said."First, we have to come out of this crisis," he said responding to the economic situation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-lauds-countrys-leadership-for-response-to-coronavirus-slams-tablighi-66421

Heads of different countries have appreciated India, he said, noting that it has been coordinating with different nations and he himself has been in touch with some of them.However, the prime minister also made it clear that India is in for the long haul in the battle against the pandemic which has wreaked havoc in many countries, including deaths in thousands in developed nations like the US, Italy and France.He described the seriousness and maturity shown by people during the lockdown as "unprecedented".Nobody could have imagined that people will show such discipline and sense of service in a huge country like India, he said, adding that the nation's collective strength was on display on Sunday evening.Referring to Sunday's exercise in which millions of households across the country switched  off their lights and lit diyas, candles or turned on mobile torches, he said it prepared Indians for the long fight ahead. "All sections of society; the rich and poor, the literate and illiterate, and people of various age groups, all joined hands to show this collective strength of 130 crore Indians. It further strengthened our resolve in this fight against the coronavirus," Modi said."This is going to be a long fight. We don't have to tire or feel defeated. We have to win in this long battle. We have to emerge victorious. Today, the nation's goal, mission and resolve are one, and this is to be victorious in this battle against the coronavirus pandemic," he added.The 21-day nation-wide lockdown announced by Modi last month is set to end on April 14.He urged BJP workers to follow his five-point suggestions, similar to what party president J P Nadda had said earlier.They should ensure that no poor person goes hungry, the prime minister said.He asked them to urge people to download the Aarogya Setu app, which informs and advises users about the coronavirus, distribute face covers and asked others to sign on thank you messages to emergency staff.Asserting that the battle against the pandemic is no less than a war, he urged party workers to donate to the PM-CARES Fund and also encourage others to contribute to it to help his government's measures against the pandemic.

06-04-2020||Our Correspondent||Rail Coach Factory Kapurthala develops ventilator||Kapurthala, April 5Having received instructions from the Railway Board, New Delhi, about exploring the possibility of making ventilators in train coaches, the Rail Coach Factory (RCF), Kapurthala, had manufactured a prototype ventilator, ‘Jeevan’, which had an original design and was developed within a week and would cost less than a regular ventilator, said officials.The ventilator prototype has been conceptualised by RCF General Manager Ravinder Gupta. It will now go for final testing at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) before being put to production to aid the country’s fight against Covid-19.In-house medical professionals of the RCF Hospital have tested the unit and given it a go-ahead, he said. Ravinder Gupta, GM, RCF, said it was an emergency ventilator built as a defiant reply to the curse of coronavirus.“It will be submitted to the ICMR for testing and validation and hopefully, it will be a savior of lives amid these hard times. The cost will be under Rs 10,000 without the compressor unit. Overall, Its price will still be a fraction of what regular ventilators available in the market cost,” he said.He said it could be used as an emergency ventilator. Production was easy and could be done with locally sourced components. The ventilator was silent and it was not reverse engineering, but an original design from scratch.Gupta said the heart of the device was the compressed air container to work the Ambu bag with air without any moving parts such as servo motor or piston or link mechanism.“It has a microprocessor-based controller and the circuit has been designed by the RCF team. A valve has been installed to regulate the breathing of the patient whether young or old. This ventilator can be optimised to more compact size by using small-size components,” he said.“The body has been made from coach components. The argon flow meter is taken from a laser welding machine and the compressor from an air cooler,” he said, adding that the team of the RCF needed to source just two parts — a regulator valve and a micro processor— from vendors in Delhi and Noida, which they brought using emergency transit services.Gupta said the team of engineers from the plant, mechanical and electrical design and IT and a group of medical professionals of the RCF Hospital and the Stores Department had persevered hard for the culmination of the prototype of the ventilator. The intellectual property rights relating to the ventilator belong to the RCF.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rail-coach-factory-kapurthala-develops-ventilator-66118

06-04-2020||By Satya Prakash||Fake news: SC order, a wake-up call for media||As India fights Covid-19 pandemic, the menace of fake news is making things worse for the government, the people and the media industry.Last week, there were four important developments on the issue. First, two FIRs were registered against a senior journalist for allegedly spreading fake news against UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.Second, the Centre requested the Supreme Court to issue directions to “prevent fake and inaccurate reporting whether intended or not, either by electronic, print or social media which will cause panic in the society”.Third, expressing serious concern over circulation of fake news that allegedly caused panic among migrant workers leading to their mass exodus from cities to their native places, the Supreme Court directed media platforms to publish government version about Covid-19 crisis.Fourth, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry issued an office memorandum and sent the SC order to the National Broadcasters Association, National Broadcasting Foundation and Press Council of India, besides Prasar Bharati and other government media organisations for compliance.Free flow of ideas and information is a pre-condition for any democracy to flourish. This requires free media functioning without any fear and favour, with the government only providing the necessary regulatory framework.Fake news poses a serious challenge to this proposition as it misleads the consumers of information, creates problems for the state and dents the credibility of media in general. In fact, it poses a threat to a democratic society as it can give a handle to the state to interfere with the functioning of media.In 2018, the government had issued guidelines that envisaged withdrawal of press accreditations of journalists involved in sharing or reporting fake news. Journalists vehemently opposed it. Later, the guidelines were withdrawn on the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who was learnt to have said that it must be left to bodies such as the Press Council of India to deal with the issue.There is no specific law to deal with fake newsmakers which allows miscreants to take undue advantage of the situation as authorities mostly remain confused as to the actionable wrong.The problem highlights widening gap between law and fast-changing technology with the former miserably failing to catch up with the latter. The policy makers have squarely failed to address the issue of fake news that has often led to communal tension.The problem of fake news can also be analysed in terms of media theory. There are four theories as to media —authoritarian, communist, libertarian and social responsibility. In authoritarian and communist regimes, there is no media freedom as media outlets are owned and controlled only by state or the Communist Party. In both these systems, there is no media choice available to the common man.While an authoritarian state uses media to perpetuate status quo, a communist regime uses it for ideological propaganda for change to achieve its ultimate objective of a “classless and stateless” society.Libertarian theory is followed in societies which are highly educated. It is premised on the fact that individuals are mature enough to exercise their own media choices without any State interference. Private ownership of media is a must in such societies which aspire to achieve maximum liberty. But often such media freedom degenerates into anarchy, for people in these societies disregard others’ feelings on issues such as religious practices.Publication of cartoons of Prophet Mohammad led to attacks on the offices of the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo in Paris, resulting into death of 12 people in 2015.That’s why many democracies, including India, follow social responsibility theory which offers a middle ground. In any case, our Constitution doesn’t provide for unbridled freedom.Unfortunately, media bodies — such as Editors Guild of India — have failed to take any effective steps to tackle the problem of fake news. It’s always good not to allow the government to dictate terms on such issues touching upon media freedom. But freedom comes with responsibility. There has to be accountability as well.Already, the Supreme Court has said it’s not possible for it to overlook the menace of fake news and asked electronic, print or social media to maintain a strong sense of responsibility and ensure that unverified news capable of causing panic is not disseminated. It’s a wake-up call for media industry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fake-news-sc-order-a-wake-up-call-for-media-66196

The Ministry of Defence in consultation with the Ministry of External Affairs had planned more than 50 exercises during 2020. “Everything has been put on hold till further orders,” said a senior functionary, adding that even after the covid scare goes away it will take some time for militaries to start re-engaging with each other. Assets like warships, planes and helicopters and combat manpower of each country have been diverted to oversee the crisis.

Sources said the wedding was scheduled to take place in Delhi on April 5. “We were informed of the postponement of the wedding two days after the lockdown was announced. It was obvious because the guests could not travel for the event,” said a guest from Saharanpur who had been invited. IANSNoting that the possibility of violence by Jamaatis cannot be ruled out if Saad is arrested now, a top official in the security establishment said, “As it is, the followers Tablighi are getting increasingly aggressive in their behaviour. They are misbehaving with the medical staff and the policemen.”Saad went into hiding, claiming he had quarantined himself, following police action at the Markaz in Nizamuddin locality.According to intelligence sources, Saad is “using the quarantine period to muster support for himself among the Jamaatis”, who are being whipped by the police to isolation centres to avoid spread of the infection.Intelligence sources, who are working in coordination with the police, said Saad could probably be hiding in the house of one of his supporters in the NCR region.
