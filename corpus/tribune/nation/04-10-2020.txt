Around 37,000 domesticated animals as well as wild animals, including rhinos in sanctuaries and national parks, were also affected due to the flood, which also damaged many roads, bridges, embankments, government buildings and schools.The Jia Bharali River was flowing above the danger level in Sonitpur district and Kopili crossed the danger mark in Nagaon district.ASDMA officials said that Assam, until early August, witnessed devastating floods that killed 122 people in 22 districts, while 26 others were killed in landslides since May 22.With a respite in monsoon rains, the situation significantly improved in the first week of August even as 57 lakh people were affected in 5,378 villages in 30 of the state's 33 districts.---IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-flood-situation-improves-further-1-35-lakh-still-hit-151029
04-10-2020||Lucknow/Hathras||Hathras case: Accused defended at meeting held at former BJP MLA’s residence||Scores of people held a meeting Sunday outside the house of a former BJP MLA in Hathras where they defended the accused in the alleged gangrape of a Dalit woman who later died, and demanded registration of an FIR against her family members.Heavy police force was deployed in the vicinity of the residence of former BJP MLA Rajvir Singh Pehalvan, located around 8-9 km from the victim’s village.One of the organisers of the meeting and Pehalvan’s son Manveer Singh denied that the gathering comprised members from the upper castes and said they were from “different sections of society”.“We welcome the CBI inquiry ordered by the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. We have faith in the investigation,” Singh told PTI while claiming that the victim’s family members were “changing their stand”.“The entire scenario has been created to blame the government. The accused persons are in favour of any type of inquiry. But the victims are changing their stand every now and then. They do not want a narco test or a CBI probe. Now they want other kinds of inquiries,” he claimed.He said an FIR should be registered by police against the complainants in the case. “Our demand is that a case should be filed against those people who had filed the case in the first instance,” he said.The 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper caste men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital where she had been brought for treatment.On Sunday, Singh also said various legal options were being explored to defend the accused in the case. He asserted that the arrest of some of the accused persons from their homes was proof of their innocence.“Had they been guilty, they would have run away from their homes. Why would they be present in their homes,” he said.He also alleged that the Congress and the Samajwadi Party were trying to influence the victim’s family as they wanted to the issue to “linger on”.The meeting assumes significance as it was held a day after Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visited the victim’s house and met her family members at a village in Hathras district, and the recommendation of a CBI probe by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath.The victim was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on Wednesday. Her family alleged that they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites. Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out “as per the wishes of the family”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hathras-case-accused-defended-at-meeting-held-at-former-bjp-mlas-residence-151025
04-10-2020||New Delhi||Scientists discover two new species of pipeworts in Western Ghats||Scientists from the Agharkar Research Institute in Pune have recently discovered two new species of pipeworts in the Western Ghats of Maharashtra and Karnataka, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) said on Sunday.The species reported from Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra has been named Eriocaulon parvicephalum (due to its minute inflorescence size), and the other reported from Kumta, Karnataka is called Eriocaulon karaavalense (named after Karaavali, Coastal Karnataka region), it said.Pipeworts (Eriocaulon) is a plant group which completes its life cycle within a small period during monsoon. It exhibits great diversity in the Western Ghats.Around 111 species of pipeworts are found in India. Most of these are reported from the Western Ghats and the eastern Himalayas, and around 70 per cent of them are endemic to the country.“One species, Eriocaulon cinereum, is well known for its anti-cancerous, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and astringent properties. E. quinquangulare is used against liver diseases. E. madayiparense is an anti-bacterial from Kerala.“The medicinal properties of the newly discovered species are yet to be explored,” the DST said.The new species were discovered while exploring the biodiversity of the Western Ghats.The scientists wanted to trace the evolutionary history of the genus Eriocaulon and made extensive efforts to collect as many species as possible from India, especially from the Western Ghats, the DST said.“While critically examining our collection, we came across two accessions, which showed different floral characters than earlier known species. Hence, we studied morphology and its DNA to confirm the novelty,” said Ritesh Kumar Choudhary, the lead author of a study on the new species.The study was published in ‘Phytotaxa’ and ‘Annales Botanici Fennici’ journals, the DST said.Identification of the species belonging to Eriocaulon is very difficult as they all look similar, which is why the genus is often referred to as a ‘Taxonomist’s nightmare’.Its tiny flowers and seeds make it difficult to distinguish between different species, Choudhary pointed out.Choudhary’s PhD student Ashwini Darshetkar said, “Future studies will focus on elucidating the evolutionary history of the genus in India. A thorough investigation of the phylogenetic relationship between all Indian species would also help in prioritising the conservation of threatened species in India.” “We are also trying to develop DNA barcodes, which will enable us to identify the species with just a portion of the leaf,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scientists-discover-two-new-species-of-pipeworts-in-western-ghats-151024

04-10-2020||New Delhi||Will request CBI chief to constitute fresh forensic team: Sushant Singh Rajput’s family lawyer||Actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s family lawyer Vikas Singh said on Sunday that he was highly perturbed by the AIIMS’ medico-legal opinion submitted to the CBI and would request the probe agency’s chief to constitute a fresh forensic team in the case.Casting aspersions over the AIIMS’ medical board ruling out murder in the death of Rajput, the senior advocate said how can the expert team give a conclusive opinion in the absence of the actor’s body.“Highly perturbed with AIIMS report. Going to request the CBI director to constitute a fresh forensic team.“How could AIIMS team give a conclusive report in the absence of the body, that too on such a shoddy post mortem done by the Cooper hospital (in Mumbai) wherein the time of death is also not mentioned,” he tweeted.The AIIMS’ medical board has ruled out murder in the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and termed it “a case of hanging and death by suicide”, the premier institute’s forensic chief Dr Sudhir Gupta said on Saturday.In its conclusive medico-legal opinion to the CBI, the six-member team dismissed the claims of “poisoning and strangling”, with Dr Gupta saying the panel did not find any trace of poison and drugs in the viscera. It is a case of hanging and death by suicide. We have submitted our conclusive report to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI),” Dr Gupta, who is also the chairman of the forensic medical board, said.There was no injury on the body other than that of hanging. Also, there was no mark of struggle and scuffle. The ligature mark on the neck was consistent with hanging, he said.Rajput, 34, who made his silver screen debut in the critically acclaimed ‘Kai Po Che’ seven years ago, was found dead in his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14.The CBI had taken over the probe from Bihar Police into the alleged abetment to suicide case filed by the actor’s father KK Singh in Patna against Rajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and her family.Earlier this week, the central probe agency had said that it has not reached any conclusion in Rajput’s death case and that all aspects were under investigation.

04-10-2020||New Delhi||BJP central election committee meets to finalise candidates for Bihar polls||After a marathon day that started with BJP’s core committee meeting, followed by LJP’s Parliamentary board decision, the BJP went into a huddle on Sunday evening at its party headquarters for its Central Election Committee (CEC) meeting, a body that decides who gets to fight the election and from which constituency.Sources suggest an agreement has been immediately reached with JD-U about seat sharing after LJP said it wants to go solo in Bihar. While one senior Bihar BJP functionary claims that Nitish Kumar’s JD-U will be fighting on 124 seats while BJP on 119, another source at Delhi hints at an agreement of 50-50 seat sharing where the JD-U will be given a symbolic one extra seat. However, no official confirmation of either arrangement has been made public so far by the BJP or the JD-U. The state has a total of 243 seats.Earlier, the JD-U and BJP were looking for 105-110 seats each. But with LJP gone, its demand for 42 seats, which sources say climbed down to 35 eventually, is also gone. JD-U will be accommodating Jitan Ram Majhi’s HAM (Secular) on its own account.The meeting is being attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP President JP Nadda, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, and party leader Shahnawaz Hussain, among others.Sources say ace shooter Shreyashi Singh who joined the BJP on Sunday evening is very likely to be fielded from either Jamui or Amarpur Assembly constituency.Sources say there have been some negotiations that went on till the last minute for around 12 seats where the BJP won last time but where JD-U wanted to field its candidates this time around.The hurry in the CEC meeting was due to the last date for filing nominations. October 8 or this coming Thursday will be the last day to file nominations for the first phase of polls. 71 out of the total 243 constituencies will go to polls in the first phase on October 28. There has been growing pressure on BJP’s central unit from probable candidates to make the announcement.Meanwhile, earlier Sunday the Parliamentary board of the LJP has announced that it will go solo citing “ideological differences” with the JD-U and even threatening to put up candidates in seats where JD-U will fight. However, it has promised a post-poll alliance with the BJP to form an “LJP-BJP government” in Bihar. The LJP and the JD-U fell out a long time ago and in the last few months, the acrimony only intensified, leading to a delay in reaching any seat sharing agreement for the NDA in Bihar.

His body was handed over to his family for cremation,” the SP told PTI. “According to villagers, he was showing symptoms of COVID-19 though inputs suggest he was not tested for it. Any sudden death with fever and breathlessness is deemed to be a suspected COVID-19 death till tests are done,” Pallava said.Ramesh was heading a local organisation squad of the Maoists as “commander” and had a reward of Rs 5 lakh on his head, he said.Expressing concern over the possible spread of COVID-19 in the interior areas of Bastar division due to Maoist activities, Pallava said Naxals were not following norms in place for the pandemic and were moving about without masks and convening meetings of villagers ignoring social distancing.“Negligence on the part of Naxals could cause the infection to spread across the interiors of Bastar region, which lack proper health infrastructure,” the SP said.As on Saturday, Bastar division, comprising seven districts including Dantewada, has 15,081 COVID-19 cases, while 60 have died due to the infection. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/naxal-commander-dies-of-suspected-covid-19-in-chhattisgarh-cops-151008
04-10-2020||Chennai||DMK MP, PMK criticise rail users getting ticket confirmation SMS in Hindi||A DMK MP and NDA constituent PMK on Sunday criticised rail users in Tamil Nadu allegedly receiving train ticket confirmation SMS in Hindi, with the parliamentarian lashing out at “Hindi imposition”.Southern Railway however clarified that the issue was the result of a particular user selecting Hindi as the preferred language while registering in the IRCTC website.“Language is an option in e-ticketing,” a Southern Railway release said.Earlier, DMK MP from South Chennai, Thamizhachi Thangapandian, took to Twitter to share a screenshot of the SMS purportedly received in Hindi.“The #GovernmentofIndia despite its promises to not impose Hindi, continues to impose the language through insidious means. Stop forcing Hindi on the non-Hindi speaking states,” she said.In a series of tweets, she tagged the Railway Ministry and urged it to take urgent steps to ensure non-Hindi speakers are also able to access the IRCTC services.“#StopHindiImposition,” she added.Party MP Kanimozhi also criticised the alleged Hindi imposition.“They are not respecting people’s feelings and are repeatedly imposing Hindi,” she said in an apparent reference to the Centre.“People (in TN) cannot read what is mentioned in the SMS since it is in Hindi,” she told reporters at the airport here and warned of “serious repercussions” due to such incidents.PMK founder Dr S Ramadoss, whose party is an ally of the ruling BJP at the Centre, alleged that SMSes for e- tickets in Tamil Nadu are “being sent in Hindi for the last two days”.     “This is a planned imposition of Hindi on non-Hindi speaking people. The Railways should stop this,” he said in a tweet.He demanded action against those behind this and urged that all Central government-related announcements in Tamil Nadu must be released only in Tamil and English.Meanwhile, Southern Railway, which earlier ‘flagged’ the matter to the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd (IRCTC), the authorised e-ticketing agency, said that in the case on hand, the person had selected Hindi as the preferred language while registering on the IRCTC portal.“Language is an option in e-ticketing...it is clarified that while registering the details under the section titled ‘profile’ in the IRCTC website, one needs to indicate the preferred language—either English or Hindi, to enable receipt of ticket related messages in the language of one’s preference,” it said.“In the instant case, in the profile of the person on whose ID the said ticket was booked, the preferred language was indicated as Hindi. This was the reason why the system generated message was sent in Hindi, which was the preferred language,” it said.Southern Railway also requested users to choose the correct language option while registering their profile in the IRCTC website for booking e-tickets.Alleged Hindi imposition has been a sensitive issue in Tamil Nadu for long.The DMK had successfully heralded an anti-Hindi agitation in the 1960s, before coming to power for the first time in 1967.Even recently, both the ruling AIADMK and DMK have opposed the Centre’s New Education Policy (NEP) 2020, with the former having rejected the three language formula proposed in it.Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami had announced that his government will only follow the two-language system—Tamil and English.

04-10-2020||New Delhi||LAC row: Seventh round of Corps Commander talks likely on Oct 12||The seventh round of Corps Commander-level talks between armies of India and China is expected to be held on October 12 with a specific agenda of firming up a roadmap for disengagement of troops from the friction points in eastern Ladakh, people familiar with the developments said on Sunday.At the talks, the two sides are also expected to look into further steps to maintain stability on the ground and avoid any action that may trigger fresh tension in the region where troops from both sides will be facing difficult conditions in the next four months due to harsh winters, they said.Following the last round of military talks on September 21, the two sides announced a slew of decisions including not to send more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoid taking any actions that may further complicate matters.The military talks were held with a specific agenda of exploring ways to implement a five-point agreement reached between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) conclave.The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.Days after the military talks, the two sides held diplomatic talks under the framework of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, but no concrete outcome emerged from the negotiation on September 30.After the diplomatic talks, the MEA said it was agreed that the next round of the meeting of senior commanders should be held at an early date so that both sides can work towards early and complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC in accordance with the existing bilateral agreement and protocols.Interestingly, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs Naveen Srivastava, who has been leading the Indian side at the WMCC talks, also attended the military talks on September 21 for the first time.Government sources said there is a possibility that he may be part of the Indian delegation at the seventh round of the Corps Commander talks.The Indian delegation at the talks is likely to be headed by Lt Gen Harinder Singh, the commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps of the Indian Army.It will be Lt Gen Singh’s last round of talks with the Chinese military as he will take charge as head of the prestigious Indian Military Academy around October 15.Lt Gen PGK Menon, who will succeed Lt Gen Singh at the 14 Corps, is also likely to be part of the Indian team at the seventh round of military talks.The situation in eastern Ladakh further deteriorated following at least three attempts by the Chinese military to “intimidate” Indian troops along the northern and southern bank of Pangong lake area between August 29 and September 8 where even shots were fired in the air for the first time at the LAC in 45 years.As the tensions escalated further, the foreign ministers of the two countries held talks in Moscow on September 10 where they reached on the five-point agreement to defuse the situation in eastern Ladakh.The agreement was the basis for the sixth round of Corps commander-level talks.In the last three months, the Indian Army rushed tanks, heavy weaponry, ammunition, fuel, food and essential winter supplies into various treacherous and high-altitude areas of the region to maintain combat readiness through the harsh winter of around four months beginning mid-October. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-row-seventh-round-of-corps-commander-talks-likely-on-oct-12-150996
04-10-2020||Purnea/Patna||Dalit leader who accused Tejashwi Yadav of demanding money to give him party ticket shot dead||A 37-year-old Dalit leader was gunned down at his residence in Bihar’s Purnea district on Sunday and his wife alleged that it was a political killing as her husband was preparing to contest Assembly election as an independent candidate after he was expelled from the RJD.After the killing, a video in which the deceased, Shakti Malik, accused RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav of seeking Rs 50 lakh as donation to give him party ticket to contest the poll from Raniganj seat and threatening to eliminate him if he continues with his good work in the constituency, went viral.The ruling JD(U) claimed that Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has exposed his true colours before the nation. Repeated efforts to reach senior RJD leaders for their reaction were unsuccessful.Police said that three bike-borne men entered the house of Shakti Malik in Purnea in the morning and shot him in the head while he was sleeping, killing him on the spot, and fled.A country-made pistol and an empty cartridge were found from the spot, K Haat police station Station House Officer Sunil Kumar Mandal said.Superintendent of Police Vishal Sharma and Sadar Sub- Divisional Police Officer Anand Pandey visited the spot.In the video that went viral, Malik claimed that he, along with the RJD’s SC/ST cell state unit president, met Tejashwi Prasad Yadav in Patna where the RJD leader sought Rs 50 lakh as donation to give him party ticket to contest Raniganj assembly constituency.According to the video, when Malik said that he would let him know of his decision later, Tejashwi made a casteist remark against him and threatened to eliminate him.It was not immediately clear when Malik made this statement to a Purnea based television channel.The deceased’s wife also alleged that there is a political conspiracy behind her husband’s killing and named several leaders who could be involved in it.JD(U) spokesman Rajiv Ranjan Prasad claimed that Malik was a Mahadalit and his family members’ statements corroborate the allegations levelled by him.“We have been raising the issue of dynastic politics, corruption, Tejashwi’s inexperience especially in dealing with alliance politics but the latest allegations has completely exposed him,” Prasad told reporters.Allegations that RJD leaders distribute party tickets after taking money or land are not new, he alleged.Prasad also alleged that Tejashwi’s “concern” for Dalits was exposed when former Bihar Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi had to leave the Grand Alliance after the RJD leadership’s shabby treatment meted out to him.

04-10-2020||Kolkata||Army corps formed during the 1962 war celebrates raising day||The ongoing standoff between India and China on the northern border formed the perfect backdrop for celebrating the raising day of Indian Army’s IV Corps (a.k.a. Gajraj Corps) in the east.The Tezpur-headquartered IV Corps was raised by the late Lt Gen B M Kaul in the middle of the Indio-China war of 1962.Even though no Ladakh-like situation has been reported from the LAC in Arunachal Pradesh guarded by the troops of IV Corps, the soldiers have to remain alert to incursions by the Chinese PLA.The IV Corps did have some tense moments last month when five Arunachali boys, hired by the army as porters, were taken into custody by the Chinese PLA. The boys were later released after the Army contacted the PLA.     On the occasion of the raising day of the formation, Lt Gen Shantanu Dayal, GOC, paid homage to those who made the supreme sacrifice. Gen Dayal complimented all ranks for their dedication and devotion to duty be it while carrying out counter insurgency operations in Assam or when deployed along the LAC in Arunachal Pradesh.The IV Corps’ finest hour was when its troops made the famous advance to Dhaka during the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971. They were the first Indian soldiers to reach Dhaka during the war. The ‘Meghna Heli Bridge Operation’ successfully carried out by the IV Corps during the 1971 war had stunned military commanders across the world. The then Corps Commander, Lt Gen Sagat Singh used Mi-4 helicopters to airlift troops across the Meghna River of Bangladesh bypassing Pakistani defences. An entire brigade was flown across the mighty river in this fashion.“The Meghna Heli-bridge on December 9 along with the Tangail Airdrop on December 11 foxed the Pakistani military and paved the way for the capture of Dhaka by the Indian Army”, Lt Gen J R Mukherjee (retd), who held multiple command positions under the IV Corps in the North East region, told the Tribune.Troops from IV Corps have also participated in operations inside Bhutan to flush out ULFA and Bodo militants from their hideouts in the forests of the Himalayan kingdom.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-corps-formed-during-the-1962-war-celebrates-raising-day-150993
04-10-2020||Ottawa||'Gandhi's concept of non-violence interconnected with philosophy, politics and action with morality'||Mahatma Gandhi's concept of non-violence is interconnected with philosophy, politics and action with morality, India's High Commissioner to Canada Ajay Bisaria has said, stressing that many of his ideas foreshadowed the movements the world now has to fight issues like climate change and sustainable development.Speaking at a virtual meeting to mark the 151st birth anniversary of Gandhi, Bisaria also pointed out that his legacy inspired several national projects in India like the Swach Bharat mission and the Clean India mission.The Gandhian concept of non-violence is interconnected with philosophy, politics and action with morality, he said on Saturday."Many of Gandhi's ideas foreshadowed the movements we now have for fighting issues like climate change and sustainable development," he added.Bisaria said Gandhi inspired many world leaders, including the Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela.Barack Obama, the former US President, saw Gandhi as an inspiration and had his portrait hanging in his office, the Indian diplomat said.He stressed the global relevance of Gandhian concept of non-violence as "not just a philosophy and a political strategy, but as a means of achieving justice and change." Recalling his experiences in Pakistan, Bisaria said two years ago, when the Indian High Commission in Islamabad organised an event to commemorate 150 years of Gandhi's birth anniversary, they feared that no Pakistani citizen would join the celebration."This was because Pakistan was dismissive of Gandhian legacy,” said Bisaria, who served as India's envoy in Pakistan.The mission invited one person, who was influenced by Gandhian thought, he said."Eventually, a large number of Pakistani citizens joined the celebration and appreciated a discussion on the Gandhi's legacy,” he said.Dr Clayborne Carson from Standard University and Dr Fazal Devji from Oxford University, who is also the author of the book titled ‘The Impossible Indian: Gandhi and the temptation of violence', lauded Gandhi's legacy during the panel discussion which was organised jointly by the Mahatma Gandhi Peace Council of Ottawa and the Carleton University in Ottawa.

They are smarting from not only being marginalised in West Bengal, and Tripura where it also ruled, but made to face existential threat from the BJP.The saffron party wrested power from Left in Tripura, emerged as the principal opposition in West Bengal in the last parliamentary elections, and is working hard at subterranean level in Kerala.The upshot of the gradual decline of Left parties is their diminishing clout in national politics.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/central-trade-unions-will-up-the-ante-in-view-of-assembly-elections-150990

A subsequent clause makes it clear that the targets are ruling communist parties in “totalitarian regimes” such as China, Cuba and North Korea. The guidance says the bar applies to members of a single political party, “organised on a dictatorial basis, with so close an identity with its governmental policies, that the party and the government constitute an indistinguishable unit”. No Communist Party in India makes that cut.Communist party members from countries like India also stand a chance of winning on appeal. If the USCIS official feels the group does not meet the definition [of a single party in a totalitarian regime], the applicant is admissible. The applicant could even suppress this information if there are no membership or dues records and no testimony about attendance of meetings.“Membership or affiliation is a question of fact for the officer to determine,” said the USCIS. A person will be found inadmissible only if there is oral or written testimony, or a document containing information about current or previous membership.There are exceptions to “assure family unity” if the applicant has blood relatives as US citizens.The US has been obsessed with Communist threats immediately after the 1917 October revolution in Russia. The US Congress had passed the Immigration Act of 1918 that authorised the detention and deportation of alien anarchists under an extremely broad definition of anarchism. Its paranoia reached a peak during the McCarthy era and got scaled down with the opening with China in the 70s and the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-policy-guidance-bars-communists-from-settling-down-150987

It will also be able to detect oil slicks and trace their origin," the official said.The main purpose of this is to trace illegal spillage of oil by ships. The Indian Ocean Region has several Sea Lanes of Communication (SLOC) and used by many ships every day. The satellites will be operated jointly by France and India to monitor ships in the Indian Ocean. The system will also cover a wide belt around the globe, benefiting a broad range of French economic interests, the official said.  Parts of the satellites will be built in both the countries and launched from India, he added.CNES and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) are also operating a number of climate-monitoring satellites together.  'Trishna', a highly precise thermal infrared observer, will also be part of the fleet of Indo-French satellites.  After a successful design phase led by a joint team of ISRO-CNES, the satellite is now set to enter its development phases in the coming months, the official said.  "It will provide continuous thermal monitoring at high resolution, its unmatched capabilities serving precious applications ranging from sustainable agriculture to drought forecasting and monitoring of urban heat islands," the official said.France and India are also collaborating on the Gaganyaan, India's first manned space mission.France will also be part of ISRO's mission to Venus, the official added.

The authorities finally decided to issue the orders to coincide with Gandhi Jayanti. Only those prisoners qualify for remission that have a good conduct and are not held for serious offences like crimes against women and children, organised crime, murders, dacoities, narcotics and terrorism. Most of the convicts who have been granted remission had completed more than 50 per cent of the sentence. Announcing the release of these convicts, the government said 39 convicts were released from Warangal Central Prison, which was earlier amidst a coronavirus pandemic, followed by 19 from Cherlapally Central Prison and 14 from Chanchalguda Central Prison.Further 26 convicts were released from Cherlapally Open Air Jail and 20 from Chanchalguda Women Prison.Recently many convicts and under trials lodged in various jails across the state have been tested positive for COVID-19. Some prisoners who were taken to hospitals for treatment at Hyderabad also reportedly escaped, following which security for prisoners had been tightened. An official statement said orders were also issued for release of convicts from Nizamabad, Karimnagar, Khammam, Sangareddy, Nalgonda and Adilabad district jails and Miryalaguda sub-jail.However, in view of the model code of conduct in force for by-elections to one assembly and one council seat, the release of convicts in four districts was put on hold. All the convicts who have been let off need to execute a personal bond of Rs 50,000 and are also required to appear before the nearest police station once in three months till the completion of their commuted sentence period. There is a strict warning that says if these people are found to be indulging in an illegal activity their remission will be revoked. The Warangal Central Jail, Superintendent Murali Babu administered an oath to the released convicts before the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi that they will not commit crimes again.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-govt-to-release-141-prisoners-following-remission-granted-to-them-on-gandhi-jayanti-150977

It does not say how much support India and South Africa have from other countries.A draft General Council decision text submitted with the letter says the waiver should last an as yet unspecified number of years and be reviewed annually.

Cumulatively, this multi-city outreach will cover 1.78 lakh people, the NGO said in a statement.According to the NGO, the outpouring of support for the displaced and marginalised during the lockdown days have come down significantly since the country began to restart and reopen. However, large swathes of population – especially among migrant workers – continues to suffer from job losses and depleted savings.“We are committed to reaching out to the bottom 1 per cent most vulnerable communities during any crisis. Though the country is currently under the unlock phase, there are still communities struggling against daily hardships. SEEDS continues to reach out to such communities for the sixth month running and is committed to carry out its support work until they can safely come out of the current crisis,” said Manu Gupta, co-founder, SEEDS.Each food kit comprises rice, wheat flour, sugar, pulses, cooking oil, and salt.

04-10-2020||Kolkata||Foreshocks, swarms caused recent earthquakes in India: Expert||The recent earthquakes in different parts of India, albeit of small magnitudes, have occurred due to foreshocks and swarms, a top official of the Geological Survey of India (GSI) said, warning that frequent tremors were a matter of concern in the subcontinent, where several areas are prone to major seismic activities.Dr Sandip Som, the deputy director general of GSI, also said foreshocks -- mild tremor preceding earthquakes -- or swarm activities -- series of earthquakes -- indicate release of tectonic stress and strain during the continuous deformation process, and a detailed study of these jolts could help predict if a significant seismic event is in store."These minor earthquakes are mainly clustered in the north-eastern and north-western Himalayan region, around the Delhi-National Capital Territory (NCT), western Gujarat and Western Maharashtra  areas which have been demarcated as seismic zones IV and V," the geologist told PTI on Sunday.In the past, too, low-magnitude earthquakes have been recorded in these regions, he said.According to the GSI scientist, earthquakes in the north-eastern and north-western Himalayas occur along the plate convergence zones -- between India and Eurasia."In the Delhi-NCT region, the spatial distribution of seismicity shows seismic activity-concentration mainly in three places -- west of Delhi (near Sonepat), along the Mahendragarh-Dehradun subsurface fault and Delhi Subsurface Ridge," he said."Similarly, in Western Gujarat, the seismic concentration is located near the intersection between Rajkot-Lathi lineament and neo-tectonic Kutch mainland fault.There is an east-west flexure of Indian lithosphere in the Western Ghat Escarpment," Dr Som said.Explaining the reason behind the frequent tremors, the geologist said any earthquake depends on the strain and stress build-up of an area."Main strain and stress build-up areas have been noted along the convergence zone between Indian and Eurasian plates.Due to continuous plate movement, stresses build up in this area. Moreover, there are around 30 water reservoirs along the WGE. Enhanced water load in the reservoirs increases pore pressure and stress, triggering earthquakes," he said.Incidentally, the GSI has deployed 30 permanent GPS stations across the country to monitor tectonic plate movements and develop a strain map to identify potential hazardous zones."Work is under progress and likely to be completed its first phase very soon. We will also carry out seismic microzonation (process of sub division of region) and active fault studies to evaluate potential geological vulnerable seismic sites," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/foreshocks-swarms-caused-recent-earthquakes-in-india-expert-150968

India has seen brutal rapes and gang-rapes in the past, many of which resulted in a public outcry on the streets.The most prominent was the 2012 Delhi gang-rape and murder case which involved a rape and fatal assault that occurred on December 16, 2012 in Munirka in south Delhi inside a moving bus. The incident took place when a 23-year-old female physiotherapy intern who was later dubbed 'Nirbhaya' (Fearless), was beaten, gang-raped, and brutally tortured in a private bus in which she was travelling with her male friend.Four of the adult convicts were hanged in Tihar jail in March this year.The infamous incident in 2013 in Mumbai also known as the Shakti Mills gang-rape, where a 22-year-old photojournalist, who was interning with a magazine in Mumbai, was gang-raped by five people, including a juvenile.The incident occurred on August 22, 2013, when she had gone to the deserted Shakti Mills compound, near Mahalaxmi in south Mumbai, with a male colleague on an assignment.Earlier in 1996, a 25-year-old law student, was found strangled in her uncle's residence. She had been raped, struck 14 times with a motorcycle helmet, and finally strangled with a wire by Santosh Kumar Singh, son of a former IPS officer, who was later arrested and convicted for the crime.In November 2019, the gang-rape and murder of a 26-year-old veterinary doctor in Shamshabad, near Hyderabad, sparked outrage across India. Her body was found in Shadnagar on November 28, 2019, the day after she was murdered.Police found that her body was doused with kerosene and then burnt.Four suspects were arrested and were killed in a police encounter on December 6, 2019, under a bridge on Bangalore-Hyderabad national highway, while they allegedly tried to flee from police custody.In 2018, the infamous Kathua rape case made headlines when an 8-year-old girl was abducted, raped, and murdered in Rasana village near Kathua in Jammu & Kashmir.The girl disappeared for a week before her body was discovered by villagers a kilometre away from the village. The incident made national news with protests across the country.In April 2019, a nine-year-old girl was allegedly raped and killed by a man in Vile Parle area in Mumbai.The girl's body was found inside a public toilet at Nehru Nagar area in Vile Parle following which the accused was arrested.Crimes against women increased 7.3 per cent from 2018 to 2019, and crimes against Scheduled Castes also went up 7.3 per cent in the same period, according to the annual National Crime Record Bureau's 'Crime in India 2019' report released on Tuesday.In terms of absolute numbers, Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of cases in both these categories.

04-10-2020||New Delhi||LJP to contest Bihar elections outside the NDA||After months of angry to and fro with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD-U, NDA ally Lok Janshakti Party on Sunday finally made public its decision to exit the alliance and contest independently in Bihar.Apparently, the decision did not come as a surprise to the BJP leadership which was “aware” of LJP president Chirag Paswan’s plan and also “prepared” for the eventuality ahead of the Central Election Committee slated later in the day. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and senior leaders of the BJP were present at the meeting headed by party president JP Nadda which continued well into the night. With the LJP walking away from the alliance, it is only but natural that the BJP will get its share and eventually may also end up contesting a larger chunk of seats than the JD-U which also has to accommodate Jitin Ram Manjhi-led HAM(S) from its quota in the 243-member Assembly. Interestingly, amid speculations of a “fixed match” between the BJP and the LJP and of Nitish Kumar being “cut to size”, the LJP has also given a major hint with its public assurance of support to the BJP in case “it forms the government in Bihar under its own CM”. So far, the LJP has said it will contest 143 seats and they will mostly be ones the JD-U is contesting. The LJP, in its Parliamentary Board meeting which it had to reschedule on the account of poor health of union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, cited “ideological differences” with Nitish Kumar’s JD (U) as it backed the idea a “BJP-LJP government in Bihar”.  “Owing to ideological differences with Janata Dal (United), LJP has decided to contest Assembly elections independently,” the LJP said, adding that it will not contest under Nitish Kumar.  At the same time. it also said it will continue to be part of the NDA in the Centre, citing instances when allies contested against each-other,  including in Jharkhand where the LJP contested independent of the NDA.  “LJP legislators will strengthen the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” it assured. Observers who see it as a “fixed match” between the LJP and BJP say incumbent CM Nitish Kumar is facing “massive anti-incumbency and possible loss of ground in the State because of his handling of Covid situation, floods, migrants etc”.  In the 2015 Assembly elections, the LJP contested 42 seats and won two. The JD (U) was then with the opposition alliance.  LJP sources say this is the right time to project Chirag Paswan as an independent leader in the State “where  Nitish Kumar is fighting his last elections and there is huge leadership vacuum”. This is the best time to expand the LJP, they said in response to the question whether Chirag Paswan’s ambition to be the CM was also a cause behind the exit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ljp-to-contest-bihar-elections-outside-the-nda-150963
04-10-2020||New Delhi||Centre estimates to utilise 40-50 crore COVID-19 vaccine doses on 20-25 cr people by July 2021: Vardhan||The Centre estimates to receive and utilise 40-50 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccine covering 20-25 crore people by July next year and it is preparing a format for the states to submit by October-end their list of priority population to be inoculated, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday.He said priority would be given to health workers engaged in COVID-19 management in getting inoculated and asserted the Centre would ensure fair and equitable distribution of vaccines, once they are ready.During an interaction with his social media followers on ‘Sunday Samvad’ platform, Vardhan said vaccine procurement would be done centrally with each consignment tracked real-time until delivery to ensure it reaches those who need it the most and there is no black-marketing.A high-level expert group is going into all aspects of vaccines and the Health Ministry is currently preparing a format in which states will submit lists of priority population groups to receive a vaccine, the Union minister said.The list of frontline health workers will include both government as well as private-sector doctors, nurses, paramedics, sanitary staff, ASHA workers, surveillance officers and many other occupational categories who are involved in tracing, testing and treatment of patients.This exercise is targeted to be completed by the end of this October and the states are being closely guided to also submit details about cold chain facilities and other related infrastructure which will be required down to the block level, Vardhan said.“The Centre is also working on plans for building capacities in human resources, training, supervision and others on a massive scale and roughly estimates to receive and utilise 400-500 million doses covering approximately 20-25 crore people by July 2021. All this is under various stages of finalisation,” he said.The minister had earlier said a COVID-19 vaccine is likely to be available by the first quarter of 2021.During the ‘Sunday Samvad’ programme, he informed his audience that the government is also keeping an eye on immunity data concerning COVID-19 disease while finalising these plans.“Our government is working round the clock to ensure that there is a fair and equitable distribution of vaccines, once they are ready. Our utmost priority is how to ensure a vaccine for each and everybody in the country,” Vardhan said.He added that a high-level committee under the chairmanship of Niti Aayog Member (Health) Dr V K Paul is drawing up the entire process.The minister said the panel is working on understanding the timelines of availability of various vaccines in the country, obtaining commitments from vaccine manufacturers to make the maximum number of doses available for India, inventory and supply chain management and also on prioritisation of high-risk groups.“This is a work in progress which will be completed by the time the vaccines are ready to ensure the swift roll-out of an immunisation programme.”       Assuring a social media follower that there would be no diversion or black-marketing of the vaccine, Vardhan said, “Vaccines will be distributed as per pre-decided priority and in a programmed manner. To ensure transparency and accountability, details of the entire process will be shared in the coming months.”To a question regarding the phase-three clinical trial of Russia’s ‘Sputnik-V’ vaccine in India, Vardhan clarified that the matter was still under consideration, and no decision has been taken yet.To another question, he replied it is not possible to comment on the superiority of one vaccine over another, but it would be ensured that “even if we have multiple vaccines, they will all be safe and will elicit the requisite immune response against coronavirus”.He said all vaccines that have proven to be safe, immunogenic and efficacious in clinical trials outside India need to undergo bridging studies to prove their safety and immunogenicity in the Indian population as well, although those can be conducted with much smaller sample size and can end quickly.Informing his audience that adverse events after vaccination are common, he said such events include local reactions such as pain at the injection site, mild fever and redness and anxiety such as palpitations, syncope or fainting.These reactions are transient, self-limiting and do not affect the protective response of the vaccine, the minister said.Detailing the ethical concerns of Human Challenge Experiments and Vardhan said, “India is not planning to venture into such trials until the method is proven to have an established benefit as per global experience.”Sharing his views on single-dose versus double-dose vaccines, he accepted that for quick control of a pandemic, it is desirable to have a single-dose vaccine, the statement said.“However, it is often difficult to achieve desired levels of immune protection using a single dose. Two-dose vaccines are suitable for attaining the desired immunogenicity as the first one gives some immune protection, and the second one augments it further.”Answering a question about the upcoming festive season, Vardhan quoted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to say, “Jaan hai to Jahan hai”, adding it was for the state governments to decide on allowing puja pandals.Maharashtra has issued an advisory for the Navratri festival under which there shall be no garba and dandiya mahotsav in the state. Gujarat has also disallowed garba and dandiya mahotsav this year, the ministry said in the statement.

04-10-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Less than 10 lakh active cases for 13th consecutive day in country||For the 13th day in an “unbroken string”, India has maintained its steady trend of clocking less than 10 lakh active cases of COVID-19, the Union Health Ministry said on Sunday.   It also said that an average of 11.5 lakh tests for detection of coronavirus infection were done on a daily basis during the past ten days.From merely one in January 2020, India’s total tests for detection of COVID-19 have crossed 7.89 crore so far. There has been a commensurate dip in the COVID-19 positivity rate, it said.“With progressively falling positivity rate, testing has worked as a highly effective tool to limit the spread of COVID-19 infection,” the ministry highlighted.There are 9,37,625 active cases of COVID-19 as on date, which is 7,371 cases less than Saturday.India has posted high daily testing numbers on Thursday, Friday and Saturday with 10,97,947, 11,32,675 and 11,42,131 tests being conducted, respectively.“There has been an exponential rise in India’s daily testing capacities. More than 15 lakhs tests can be conducted every day.“An average of 11.5 lakh tests were done on a daily basis during the past ten days,” the ministry said.Very high levels of testing lead to early identification, prompt isolation and effective treatment of COVID-19 cases.

04-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi firefighters rescue more than 2,400 birds in over 6 months||Firefighters in the national capital rescued more than 2,400 birds between mid-March and September, with a maximum number of such cases being reported around Independence Day when people traditionally fly kites and leave many stray strings that create a death trap for them.According to data shared by the Delhi Fire Services (DFS), they received 13,271 distress calls between March 15 and September 30 this year, of which 2,433 were for rescue of birds and 1,681 for animals.Firefighters receive on an average 150-200 calls every month for rescue of birds or animals. And the number goes up sharply in the month of August.This time, DFS received 882 calls for bird rescue and 345 calls for animal rescue in August alone, its director Atul Garg said.He said the drastic rise in bird and animal rescue calls during August was due to the kite flying season, especially around Independence Day celebrations.Fire services officials said most of the rescue calls they receive are for birds like crows, pigeons, parrots that either get stuck on electric wire or a tree due to kite string. Or, they get calls related to cows, cattle, dogs or cats which get stuck inside narrow lanes, closed spaces, sometimes even inside houses, in a pit, canal or a drain.The officials that for rescue of birds and animals, a vehicle is sent along with a team consisting of four-five firemen. The vehicle usually has a ladder but in cases, where it faces difficulties with high rises, bigger vehicles are sent if required. Once the bird is rescued and in case, it needs treatment, the fire services personnel shift them to a bird hospital.Recalling an incident of September 28, a fire official said they received a call from the police control room seeking assistance to rescue a cow that fell into a drain near a petrol pump in Sector-21, Rohini.With the help of ropes and locally available equipment, the cow was pulled out from the drain safely by the firefighters which they said required a lot of patience.Talking about the challenges involved in such rescue operations, Garg said one of the difficulties they face when it comes to rescue of a bird or a trapped animal is the spot is usually not easily accessible. There are also no specialised equipments for their rescue. Most of the time, a hydraulic platforms meant for highrise buildings are used.Another challenge, he said, is "when it comes to trees, while trying to rescue a bird entangled in a kite string on a tree, even if a branch of a tree falls down or even one movement goes wrong while trying to catch the bird, it may also fall down and die. In that case, our entire effort of rescue goes in vain, if what we are trying to save will not be left." Garg said the firemen do not usually use the traditional methods while rescuing a bird or an animal."Bird rescue calls are most challenging and difficult since there is no special equipment which can be used in the rescue. It's mostly the experience of the firemen, their presence of mind, utmost patience and locally made arrangements that helps. Just like human lives, we give utmost priority to birds and animals rescue calls, which we have been doing for ages now with precautions and care," he said.

They demanded a CBI probe into the case.Another panchayat was held on Sunday morning where a large number of people claimed that the accused persons were being falsely implicated in the case and demanded a probe into the call detail records of the victim’s family members.

04-10-2020||New Delhi||Need to bring back Poshan Abhiyan at the level it was in pre-COVID times: UNICEF||There was a need to bring back the national nutrition mission at the same level it was before the coronavirus outbreak, said chief of UNICEF India (Nutrition) Arjan de Wagt.He said programmes under the Poshan Abhiyan such as the functioning of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), take-home rations and giving pregnant women and children iron folic tablets to prevent anaemia needed to be fully implemented again.“We need Poshan Abhiyan back at the same level and beyond than where we were in January (pre-COVID times). It does not require any different response. We need the same programmes. We need the ICDS functioning, take-home rations functioning, pregnant women and children receiving iron folic tablets to prevent anaemia,” Wagt told PTI.He stressed that all routine services needed to get back on track and not any new intervention.According to Wagt, in many cases, there was a need to adjust and look for alternative ways of implementation of different programmes related to nutrition because of the pandemic.“In many cases, we need to adjust. For example, since schools are closed, children need to get the food they used to get in schools. So, we need to look for other ways like take-home rations delivered door-to-door. There is a need to go to every door that needs it and not a smaller number of people. Iron folic tablets, which are distributed to adolescent girls in schools, can be given to those who need it through communities,” he said.There are three pathways on how coronavirus affects nutrition in India. The first is increasing poverty with people losing jobs. Poverty leads to food insecurity and different eating behaviours. The second is how services were affected and the third one is how leadership was affected in these times in terms of focus on nutrition, Wagt said.He stated that in the past, ‘Poshan Pakwada’ and ‘Poshan Maah’ had a key component of bringing a large number of people together in communities, mass gatherings to educate people about good nutrition, but as seen in the last four weeks there were no such gatherings due to the coronavirus infection.“So, more mass media, home visits, home counselling are needed,” he said.Poshan Abhiyan was launched by the Centre in 2018 to reduce low birth weight, stunting and undernutrition and anaemia among children, adolescent girls and women. Under the mission, Poshan Maah is observed every September.During Poshan Maah, initiatives are taken to bring a behavioural change towards issues related to maternal, infant and young childcare and feeding practices. Poshan Pakwada is a 14-day event held every year to spread awareness on the importance of nutrition.According to the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4), 38.4 per cent children under five years of age are stunted (low height-for-age) and 21 per cent wasted (low weight-for-height).About the impact of missing out on midday meals given to children in schools due to coronavirus, Wagt said many children went to school as they knew they would get food there, and in many cases, it was one of the most nutritious meals a child gets.“During the lockdown, there have been efforts to bring that food to the doorstep of children. But I am not sure how effective that has been,” he said.Asserting that families needed to be made adequately aware of the importance of nutrition, Wagt said: “For many people, food is for hunger but people don’t realise that eating is to nourish the body and mind, to build the immune system.”“I have always been saying that all these government programmes of feeding and nutrition are crucial, but for me, it also lays emphasis on how nutrition is too important to be left to the government. For me, nutrition is even too personal to leave it to government and it needs to be communities, families and parents that are also feeding children and at the end of the day the plate in the home is provided by the family,” he said.On the importance of breastfeeding even in the times of coronavirus pandemic, Wagt said breast milk was the first vaccination provided to a child and the risk of not breastfeeding or poor breastfeeding was much higher than the risk of transmitting COVID to the baby.“There are special proteins, special immune factors in the breast milk that builds the immune system of the baby in the first few days and then in the first six months. So breastfeeding is very essential but people have been afraid of spreading the virus to other people and are asking if they should continue breastfeeding,” he advised.There was very little evidence that breastfeeding could transmit the virus. Also, the risk of coronavirus among children didn’t seem to be that high as the risk of not breastfeeding. Breastfeeding must continue even in times of COVID with proper precautions, Wagt stressed.

"Once its clear, NCW will give notice to everyone. I have details of each and every person putting pictures on social media or on posters," said she.On the evening of October 2, Malviya had tweeted a video of the victim saying, "Haathras victim's interaction with a reporter outside AMU where she claimed there was an attempt to strangulate her neck."None of it is to take away from the atrocity of the crime but unfair to colour it and demean the gravity of one heinous crime against another."The 48-second video was fodder enough for many to demand action against the BJP leader for allegedly violating laws that preserve the identity of sexual assault victims.Under the Indian penal code, revealing the identity of a sexual assault victim is prohibited.But with demand for action against Malviya, the NCW has clarified, whenever it does take action against him, others like Swara Bhaskar and Digvijaya Singh too will face consequences.The 19-year-old Hathras girl died following an alleged gang rape. She died on September 29 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital after having suffered fractures, partial paralysis and a spinal injury following the savage assault.

04-10-2020||New Delhi||RBI affirms currency notes potential corona carriers: CAIT||The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) on Sunday said the RBI had affirmed the possibility of currency notes as potential carriers of novel coronavirus and demanded government incentives for digital payments.The development comes after the CAIT wrote a letter to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on March 9, 2020, seeking clarification whether or not currency notes were carriers of bacteria and viruses.However, the letter was forwarded to the Reserve Bank of India, which replied to the CAIT and hinted that currency notes could be carriers of bacteria and viruses, including coronavirus, and therefore more and more usage of digital payments should be done to avoid handling of currency, the confederation said in a statement.The RBI further stated that “in order to limit the coronavirus pandemic, the public can make payments by sitting at homes through various online digital channels such as mobile and Internet banking, credit and debit cards etc and avoid using or withdrawing cash to the extent possible”.According to CAIT national president BC Bhartia and secretary-general Praveen Khandelwal, the RBI’s reply indicates that the currency notes do carry viruses and bacteria and therefore, the maximum use of digital payments to avoid handling of currency notes was advised by them.Furthermore, the CAIT urged Sitharaman to introduce an ‘incentive’ scheme for acceptance and adoption of digital payments.“Bank charges levied for digital transactions should be waived and the government should give subsidy directly to the banks in lieu of bank charges,” the statement said, adding: “In due course, such subsidy will not be a financial burden on the government; on the other hand, it will minimise the expenses incurred on printing of banknotes.”In addition, the CAIT pointed out that the RBI in its annual report released on August 29, 2019, had mentioned that “the value and volume of notes in circulation increased by 17 per cent and 6.2 per cent to Rs 21,109 billion and 1,08,759 million pieces, respectively, during 2018-19”.“In value terms, the share of Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes, which had together accounted for 80.2 per cent of the total value of notes in circulation at the end of March 2018 had increased to 82.2 per cent by the end of March 2019,” the traders’ body added.

04-10-2020||Panaji||Javadekar takes ‘middlemen’ jibe at parties opposing farm laws||Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday alleged that parties opposing the newly enacted farm laws were acting as “middlemen for middlemen”.Talking to reporters on the second day of his visit to Goa as part of the ruling BJP’s initiative to create awareness about the farm laws, Javadekar said the actual situation was that farmers earned less for their produce and customers had to buy it at higher rates.The middlemen hiked the prices and the farm laws dealt with this problem by eradicating these middlemen, he said.“Sometimes I feel the opposition parties have become middlemen for middlemen,” he alleged. Claiming that the agitation against farm laws will die out on its own, the Minister said: “Falsehood has limited life while truth lives forever.”“Congress and NCP launched their campaign to protest against the farm bills. I am going to ask them to look at their manifesto. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh has spoken about such (agricultural) reforms in his speeches. But the Congress has now done a U-turn,” he said.He alleged that the opposition parties were spreading a “myth” that APMCs (agriculture produce market committees) would be shut down under the new laws and the government will stop purchasing the produce or the minimum support price (MSP) would be stopped.“All these are lies,” Javadekar said.The BJP leader also said the conduct of opposition leaders in the Rajya Sabha over the passage of these bills was “condemnable and shameful”.Referring to a protest by a group of people on his way to Mapusa town on Saturday, Javadekar said he doubts that those who were protesting were real farmers.He said: “As much as 60 per cent population of the country was involved in the farming sector but their contribution to the GDP (gross domestic product) was 15 per cent. There was a need to increase productivity and also give them markets outside the country so that their standard of living improves.”Javadekar said when he was in school, the country’s population was 30 crore, which had now increase to 138 crore but despite that, there’s no shortage of food.“We are thankful to farmers who have been feeding our country,” he said, adding that it was the responsibility of the government to increase their income.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, became law after getting the presidential assent recently.Javadekar refused to comment on the issue of diversion of the Mahadayi river water, considered as the lifeline of Goa, by neighbouring Karnataka.Goa and Karnataka are locked in a dispute over sharing of the Mahadayi river water.Goa has been strongly opposing the Kalasa Banduri project proposed to be built by Karnataka on the river, which is aimed at providing drinking water to three north Karnataka districts by diverting the Mahadayi water into the Malaprabha river.Asked about the Centre’s silence over the issue, Javadekar said: “The matter is before the court and I will not comment in it. There is nothing which is pending with us because nothing comes to us. CM will answer questions on it.”The Supreme Court in an interim order in February this year allowed the plea of the Karnataka government for implementation of the final award by a tribunal for sharing of water between Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra from the Mahadayi river.It also said the interim order was subject to the final outcome of the petitions filed by the three states against the tribunal’s award.The Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal passed an order in 2018 allocating 13.42 TMC water (including 3.9 TMC for diversion into the depleted Malaprabha river basin) from the Mahadayi river basin to Karnataka.Maharashtra was allotted 1.33 TMC water while Goa was given 24 TMC in the final decision of the tribunal.

The medical institute has apparently dismissed theories about strangling and poisoning as well. A team of four doctors from AIIMS was asked to study the report of the autopsy. Reportedly, SSR’s viscera received by them was very less in quantity and degenerative.Accept the facts, says actor Rahul JaittlyActor Rahul Jaittly, last seen in Heer Ranjha, believes the new development in SSR’s case is a ray of hope for the family. He adds, “SSR’s family members deserve to know the truth more than anyone else. And if AIIMS has given the report, which is ruling out murder, then we too have to accept the facts as they are. Investigation and law do not run on emotions, and it is about putting two-and-two together. I have full faith in agencies involved in the investigation.” He adds, “It is true that the investigators had to run in all directions to rule out every possibility that existed. May God give the strength to people to accept the truth, whether it is a murder or a suicide; it has been hard these past few months.” (Inputs by Sheetal)Kangana Ranaut continues to tweetHowever, AIIMS panel led by Dr Sudhir Gupta has finally completed the examination and closed the file after giving conclusive medico-legal opinion. The CBI is now corroborating the report with their investigation. “There were no injuries on the body other than of hanging. There were no marks of struggle/scuffle on the body and clothes of the deceased,” says Dr Sudhir Gupta, chairman of AIIMS Forensic Medical Board formed in Sushant Singh Rajput death case.SSR’s sister Shweta Singh Kirti is also hopeful of getting justice. After AIIMS report was out, Shweta took to Twitter and wrote: “We Will Win!”Vikas Singh, the lawyer representing Sushant’s father, had previously claimed that an AIIMS doctor had told him that the ligature marks on Sushant’s neck were consistent with strangulation. Addressing a press conference, Vikas had said, “AIIMS doctor told me that Sushant’s death was by strangulation.” But now, reports confirm that it was a case of suicide. The report further states that CBI is likely to continue its probe into abetment to suicide as Sushant Singh Rajput’s family had filed a case with Bihar police against Rhea Chakraborty and others.A source shares, “All aspects are still open in the probe; if any evidence comes to light proving otherwise, Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (murder) will be added, but nothing has come up in 45 days of the probe.”Fans seek justiceMeanwhile, Sushant’s fans continue seeking justice for the late actor. Hundreds of SSR fans gathered at Delhi’s Jantar Mantar on October 2 to kick-start a three-day-long hunger strike seeking justice for Sushant. Since Friday, social media has #Revolution4SSR and #HungerStrike4SSR trending on Twitter.While the hunger strike will continue today (Sunday) as well, Saturday saw #302ForSSRKillers making its way into the Twitter trending list. Fans are not satisfied with the AIIMS report and demand CBI to solve the mystery behind Sushant’s death. SSR’s sister Shweta Singh Kirti is also hopeful of getting justice. After AIIMS report was out, Shweta took to Twitter and wrote: “We Will Win!”If at one point the whole Bollywood industry was supporting the case and showcased solidarity, today, but for a few stray voices, no one wants to speak about it.Taking a jibe at the state of affairs, filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma in a tweet said, “Now that AIIMS ruled out murder in SSR case and if CBI also does the same, I guess the next demand will be for a CIA or a MOSSAD investigation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/irrespective-of-the-report-by-aiims-that-rules-out-murder-angle-in-ssr-case-fans-continue-to-demand-justice-150857

Without prejudice to the priority attached to nuclear disarmament, Shringla said India not only remained committed to the immediate commencement of the FMCT negotiations, but also espoused the policy of “no first use” against nuclear weapon states and non-use against non-nuclear weapon states.‘World in shadow of catastrophe’United Nations: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the world was living “in the shadow of nuclear catastrophe” fuelled by growing distrust and tensions between nuclear powers. He said strains between countries that possessed nuclear weapons “have increased nuclear risks”. Without naming any country, Guterres said programmes to modernise nuclear arsenals “threaten a qualitative nuclear arms race”. APShringla said India was a key partner in global efforts towards disarmament and strengthening the non-proliferation order and its proposals were in line with the Final Document of the First Special Session of the UN General Assembly on disarmament. India had documented its approach to nuclear disarmament in a working paper submitted to the UNGA First Committee in 2006 and to the Conference on Disarmament in 2007. It remains convinced that there is a need for meaningful talks among all states possessing nuclear weapons for building trust and confidence.“Its annual resolution in the UNGA on the ‘Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons’ tabled since 1982 enjoys wide support and reaffirms that any use of nuclear weapons will be a violation of the UN Charter and a crime against humanity,” the Foreign Secretary pointed out.India has since 1998 tabled another annual resolution that calls for immediate and urgent steps to reduce the risks of unintentional and accidental use of nuclear weapons, including through de-alerting and de-targeting.“It also accords high priority to the Conference on Disarmament as the world’s single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-for-gradual-but-total-nuke-disarmament-shringla-150686

In the wake of the pandemic, the government had shut down the Kartarpur corridor in March. Pakistan too had imposed a ban on its nationals from accessing it.In June, Pakistan had reopened the corridor briefly to commemorate Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s death anniversary, but India had rejected the offer as the pandemic was a major worry.The MEA said it continued to remain in touch with the authorities concerned, including Ministries of Home Affairs and Health, on its reopening.A notification issued by Pakistan Ministry of Religious Affairs on Friday allows Indian visitors to come daily from dawn to dusk.The MEA also pointed out that Pakistan was yet to fulfil some commitments at the time of opening of the corridor and in the bilateral agreement signed in October last year. Even after a year, Pakistan has not constructed the bridge over Budhi Ravi Channel, while it is ready at India’s end. Despite a technical meeting with Pakistan, there is no progress by Pakistan, Srivastava said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-hit-india-not-to-reopen-kartarpur-corridor-150688

We are committed to ensuring the strictest punishment for the perpetrators of this crime,” CM Yogi tweeted.Addl Chief Secy Awasthi, DGP also meet familyprotests in punjab, haryana, hP over incidentThe Gandhi siblings, meanwhile, said the family had sought a judicial probe. The Dalit girl was allegedly sexually assaulted near her home on September 14 and died of grave injuries at a Delhi hospital on Tuesday, triggering protests especially after the police cremated the body by stealth at night against the family’s wishes.“We will fight against injustice and will go wherever injustice is being done. No one can stop us,” Priyanka said after meeting the family for 45 minutes. The meeting took place after the UP Government buckled under pressure to lift barricades that had kept the grieving family off limits for visitors for over 48 hours. The visuals of Priyanka hugging the victim’s mother went viral as the tragedy-struck Hathras home teemed with crowd that followed the Gandhis. “I understand your pain. I also have a daughter,” Vadra told the family. The state administration today cited Covid protocol to allow people in groups of five to meet the family. They also said barricading was in place only to facilitate the SIT team, which completed its probe today.Also, for first time since the crime, two high-ranking UP officials — Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi and DGP HC Awasthy — met the kin, who today collected their daughter’s ashes for immersion as per Hindu rituals.The Gandhis earlier left for Hathras in an SUV driven by Priyanka, who was seen shoving cops along the Delhi-UP border to prevent them from baton-charging Congress workers. The Congress delegation comprised MPs, including Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, KC Venugopal, Partap Bajwa and Shashi Tharoor, and party workers. The Gandhis along with Chowdhury and Venugopal were later allowed to proceed to Hathras ending a 48-hour standoff. Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani, meanwhile, accused the Gandhis of enacting a political stunt and staging a visit to Hathras for political gains. Irani’s vehicle was blocked by angry Congress protesters in Varanasi today.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-to-probe-hathras-case-gandhis-meet-victims-kin-150675
