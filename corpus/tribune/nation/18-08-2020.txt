18-08-2020||New Delhi||‘India has largest number of kids with Thalassemia Major’||India has the largest number of children with Thalassemia Major who need regular blood transfusion and 10,000-15,000 children having the blood disorder are born every year in the country, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Tuesday.Lauding the work of the Indian Red Cross Society at the inauguration of a Thalassemia Screening and Counselling Centre at its National Headquarters Blood Bank here, the minister said such initiatives “will enable us in educating the common people on prevention of this disease”.He said there are around 270 million Thalassemia patients in the world.“India has the largest number of children with Thalassemia Major in the world, about 1 to 1.5 lakh, and about 10,000-15,000 children having Thalassemia Major are born every year.“The only cure available for such children is bone marrow transplantation (BMT). However, BMT is difficult and not affordable by the parents of all these children. Therefore, the mainstay of treatment is repeated blood transfusions, followed by regular iron chelation therapy to remove the excessive iron overload, consequent to the multiple blood transfusions,” he was quoted as saying in a statement.Vardhan said this new initiative of IRCS will provide a golden opportunity to administer adequate therapy to those affected enabling them lead a better life and preventing the birth of children affected with hemoglobinopathies, through carrier screening, genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis.“This programme will aid in prevention of birth of children affected with hemoglobinopathies, through well-planned screening programmes, information dissemination and awareness generation activities and help avert the imminent threat of this genetic disorder turning into a major health problem.“With these progressive initiatives, we shall soon be able to achieve the New India being envisioned by the prime minister by 2022,” he said.Haemoglobinopathies such as Thalassemia and sickle cell disease are inherited disorders of red blood cells and are preventable. These illnesses are chronic, life impairing and in some cases, life threatening and impose a heavy emotional and financial burden on families.In India, Thalassemia Major and the severe form of Thalassemia Intermedia (TI) constitute the major burden of disease. Both are commonly managed by regular lifelong blood transfusions and regular iron chelation, the statement said.These Thalassemia syndromes are caused by inheritance of abnormal (beta) Thalassemia genes from both parents or abnormal beta-Thalassemia gene from one parent and abnormal variant haemoglobin gene (HbE, HbD) from the other parent, it said. — PTI PLB||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-has-largest-number-of-kids-with-thalassemia-major-127968

18-08-2020||Beijing||CPC expels Xi’s critic, who accused him of provoking conflict with India to divert attention||China’s ruling Communist Party has expelled a staunch critic of President Xi Jinping who has accused him among others of “provoking” conflict with other countries, including with India, to divert the attention of the Chinese public from domestic economic and social tensions.The Communist Party of China (CPC) expelled Cai Xia, a former professor at the Central Party School, as punishment for speeches “that damaged the reputation of the country”, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported on Monday.Cai, 68, was punished because she had made speeches with “serious political problems”, the report said quoting a notice on the school’s website.Her speeches were of “extraordinarily execrable nature”, and seriously violated the political discipline of the party, the notice said.Cai told the Post that she was safe and well in the United States but declined to elaborate.In an interview to the UK’s Guardian newspaper in June, Cai said Xi was provoking conflict between China and India besides encouraging anti-American sentiment to consolidate his own position and authority.Asked what benefit is there to making China an enemy of the world and why Xi would provoke conflicts, Cai said, “there are several factors. Among them is that he wants to consolidate his own position and authority”.“Considering domestic economic and social tensions, as well as those in the party of the last few years, he will think of ways to divert the attention of the Chinese public, provoking conflict with other countries, for example encouraging anti-American sentiment and the recent clash between China and India,” she said, apparently referring to the clash in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh.She also criticised Xi on multiple issues, including the constitutional amendment removing the two-term limit for the President paving the way for lifelong tenure, secrecy related to coronavirus casualties and not acting to curb the virus when he came to know of it on January 7 this year.She said Xi forced through the amendment of China’s Constitution to abolish term limits for the President in 2018, giving him the ability to stay in power indefinitely.Cai said that China was moving towards disaster “because people cannot speak the truth.The party central school, where Cai worked is an important ideological institution was headed by Xi before he took over power in 2012. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cpc-expels-xis-critic-who-accused-him-of-provoking-conflict-with-india-to-divert-attention-127966

18-08-2020||New Delhi||SC’s PM-CARES decision: BJP hails verdict, attacks Rahul; Cong calls it ‘body blow to transparency’||The Supreme Court decision on the PM CARES Fund evoked contrasting reactions from the BJP and the Congress on Tuesday, with the ruling party hailing it as a “resounding blow to the nefarious designs” of Rahul Gandhi and the opposition party describing it as a “body blow to transparency”.The apex court has refused to direct the Centre to transfer the contributions made to the PM CARES Fund for battling the COVID-19 pandemic to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), saying both are entirely different funds with separate object and purpose.“Transparency is writ large in the PM CARES Fund,” BJP leader and Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told a press conference, rubbishing the Congress’ criticism on the issue.Reacting to the judgement, BJP president JP Nadda said it was a “resounding blow to the nefarious designs” of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and his “band of rent a cause” activists.“The country very well knows that the orchestrated smear campaign against PM CARES is an attempt by the Congress to wash its sins,” he said.Expressing disappointment over the verdict, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the apex court let go an opportunity to bring in transparency in the fund, which has “its own opaque and murky rules”, and, thereby, deviated from the belief that “sunlight is the best disinfectant”.“The SC judgment is a body blow to transparency and accountability of government to people. It marks a sad letter day for responsibility and answerability of rulers to the electorate and remind them that they are not ‘Monarchs’ but ‘servants of the people’,” he said.“SC scrupulously believed that ‘sunlight is the best disinfectant’. Today, the court, in a departure from that tradition, passed up an opportunity to demand answers on the PM Cares Fund that seeks public money but plays by its own opaque & murky rules,” he said in another tweet.At a press briefing, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said the ruling was a “jolt to all those people who are seeking transparency”.“This is not Narendra Modi’s money. This is not Narendra Modi’s individual fund; this is the Prime Minister’s fund, meant for the people, who demand transparency. The people want to know—where did you get the money from, where have you spent it?” he said.The SC judgement came on a PIL filed by NGO ‘Centre for Public Interest Litigation’, seeking a direction that all the money collected under the PM CARES Fund for the COVID-19 pandemic be transferred to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said there is no statutory prohibition for the Centre on utilising the NDRF for providing assistance in the fight of COVID-19 in accordance with the guidelines issued for administration of the NDRF.Targeting Gandhi and the Congress, Prasad told reporters that the apex court has destroyed the “conspiracy” sponsored by them.“Transparency is writ large in the PM CARES Fund both in the terms of legal requirement and the management of the fund received,” he said, adding that there is no corruption allegation against the Modi government in the six years of its rule so far.The minister underscored that the fund will be audited, as he accused Gandhi of sparing no effort to weaken the country’s resolve in its fight against COVID-19.“The verdict by the Supreme Court on PM CARES is a resounding blow to the nefarious designs of Rahul Gandhi and his band of ‘rent a cause’ activists. It shows that the truth shines despite the ill intent and malicious efforts of the Congress party and its associates,” Nadda tweeted.Coming down heavily on Gandhi, the BJP chief said his “rants” have been repeatedly dismissed by the common man who has “overwhelmingly” contributed to the PM CARES Fund.With the highest court also pronouncing its verdict, will Rahul and his “rent a cause activist army” mend their ways or embarrass themselves further, he asked.The BJP president alleged that the Gandhi family treated Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) as its “personal fiefdom for decades and brazenly transferred citizens’ hard-earned money from PMNRF to its family trusts”.Gandhi had on Monday tweeted “PM CARES for Right To Improbity” while tagging a news report which alleged that the Prime Minister’s Office had denied an RTI application seeking information on the Fund.Prasad said the PM CARES Fund is a registered public trust created to fight emergencies like the coronavirus and added it has so far contributed Rs 3,100 crore in the battle against the pandemic.Out of this, Rs 2,000 crore was spent on procuring over 50 thousand ventilators, Rs 1,000 crore was given to states to help migrant labourers and Rs 100 crore for vaccine research, he said.This is the highest number of ventilators made available for critical care in one go since independence, he said.

They have enrolled over 15,000 people under this fake scheme,” said Anyesh Roy, the Cyber Crime Department’s Deputy Commissioner of Police.Neeraj revealed that another website was being run by Suvender Yadav of Patna in the name of ‘PM Shishu Vikas Yojana’.On Neeraj’s instance, the police conducted a raid in Patna and arrested Suvender, the DCP said.These website operators had formulated a scheme in the name of PM Shishu Vikas Yojana and offered what they called were health insurance cover and financial support for education, Roy said.For getting maximum number of children enrolled, they appointed state heads across the country India and each state head further employed district heads in their respective states.These district heads appointed ground level agents who worked at gram panchayat level and conducted meetings at village or tehsil levels to lure the local people, police said, adding that further investigation is underway.The Press Information Bureau had earlier this year ran a fact-check on the claim that there was a government scheme under the name ‘Pradhan Mantri Shishu Vikas Yojana’.“Claim: - Govt. School students to get various monetary benefits under the ‘Pradhan Mantri Shishu Vikas Yojana’. Reality: This is a #FakeNews. There is NO “Pradhan Mantri Shishu Vikas Yojana” under the Central Government,” the PIB Fact Check had tweeted on January 30.

18-08-2020||---||LAC row: Disengagement meet to test China’s sincerity||New Delhi, August 18China’s statement on Monday said it will continue to work with India to properly manage differences is likely to be put to test later this week at the meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC).On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian had said China will continue to work with India to enhance political mutual trust, properly manage differences, strengthen practical cooperation and “jointly uphold the big picture of bilateral relations”.Sources said so far the Chinese troops have disengaged and moved back from Galwan Valley and Hot Springs. The meeting could see India pressing for the vacation of Chinese troops from Pangong Tso Finger areas, Depsang and Gogra.Sources said this move is in line with the two Special Representatives (SRs) of India and China agreeing that early and complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC and de-escalation from India-China border areas in accordance with bilateral agreement and protocols was essential for the smooth overall development of bilateral relations.Several meetings of WMCC and also of Senior Commanders have already taken place to discuss the implementation of the ongoing disengagement process and further steps to complete it at the earliest.Last week, the MEA had said both sides have agreement on broad principles of disengagement and based on it, “some progress” had been made. Translating these principles on ground is a complex process that requires re-deployment of troops by each side towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC. “It is natural that this can be done only through mutually agreed reciprocal actions,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said on August 14.India has been making the point that restoration of pre-Covid status quo is necessary and essential in the context of overall development of the bilateral relationship. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also underlined this aspect by stating that “the state of the border and the future of our ties cannot be separated”.The agreement to disengage from several friction points along LAC in eastern Ladakh was agreed upon in a two-hour conversation between the two SRs on July 5, about 20 days after the Galwan Valley clash.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-row-disengagement-meet-to-test-chinas-sincerity-127941

18-08-2020||New Delhi||Ninja drones to protect rail assets||he Railways has procured Ninja unmanned aerial vehicles for monitoring its assets and ensure safety for passengers, Railways Minister Piyush Goyal has said. The Mumbai Division of Central Railway has recently procured two Ninja UAVs for better security and surveillance in railway areas like station premises, railway track sections, yards, workshops. “Eye in the Sky: Improving Surveillance System, Railways has recently procured Ninja Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. With real-time tracking, video streaming & automatic failsafe mode, the drones will enhance monitoring of the railway assets and ensure additional safety for passengers,” Goyal said in a tweet.The Railway Protection Force (RPF) has planned extensive use of drones for the purpose of railway security, a statement from the ministry said.Nine drones have been procured by RPF so far at a cost of Rs 31.87 Lakh at South Eastern Railway, Central Railway, Modern Coaching Factory, Raebareilli and South Western Railway, it said.It is further proposed to procure 17 more drones in future at a cost of Rs 97.52 Lakh. Nineteen RPF personnel have so far been trained in operation and maintenance of drones out of which four have received licenses for flying drones. Six more RPF personnel are being trained, the ministry said.The purpose of the drone deployment is to provide a force multiplier and aid the deployed security personnel, it said.While it can help in inspection of Railway assets and safety of yards, workshops, car sheds, it can also be used to launch surveillance on criminal and anti-social activities like gambling, throwing of garbage, hawking in railway premises, it added.“It may be deployed for data collection, analysis of such data collected may prove to be extremely useful in vulnerable sections for safe operations of trains. The drone may be pressed in service at disaster sites for helping in rescue, recovery and restoration and coordinating of efforts of various agencies,” the ministry said.“It is very useful while undertaking mapping of railway asset to assess the encroachments on railway property. During large scale crowd management efforts, it may give vital inputs like crowd magnitude, probable time of arrival and dispersal based on which crowd regulation efforts may be planned and executed,” the statement said. “Drones were used to enforce lockdown and monitor the movement of migrants during the COVID-19 lockdown,” it said. A drone camera can cover large areas that require 8-10 RPF personnel. Thus, it may lead to substantial improvement in utilisation of scarce manpower. Drone beats have been designed based on railway asset, sensitivity of area, activity of criminals. Any suspicious activity if noticed is intimated to the nearest RPF post of division to apprehend the criminal live.One such criminal was apprehended on a real time basis in Wadibunder Yard area while he was trying to commit theft inside railway coach stationed in the yard, the Railways said.

Panyala Raju, is a native of Jagityal district of Telangana, posted false information in June while working in Saudi Arabia and a lookout notice was issued for him that led to his arrest at Mumbai airport upon his arrival recently.  But when it comes to VIPs, such action is wanting. The Telangana police have failed to act against Raja Singh, the lone BJP MLA from Telangana who has time and again posted controversial material on social media, but says he “works in the national interest”. He had even refused to take oath as an MLA under a pro tem speaker, who represented the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen  And now Raja Singh, who represents a Hindu dominated Goshamahal assembly constituency in Hyderabad, has denied posting any communal material on Facebook saying his account had been “hacked and blocked” in 2018. He has accused the state police of not taking action in the matter.  He has been under the lens after the US newspaper Wall Street Journal had cited interviews with unnamed Facebook insiders to claim one of its senior India policy executives intervened in internal communication to stop a permanent ban on a BJP MLA from Telangana after he allegedly made communally charged posts.   Singh is known for his pro-Hindutva views, but in a video released by him, he said, “I am being projected in such a way that I am the most dangerous in the entire world (like) he (Singh) says something on social media, then something or the other happens. I would like to tell the media that I am a person who works in the national interest. Cite an example where I could be blamed for any social strife.”  He has said there were many social media accounts across the country opened by unknown people in his name and it was not possible for him to stop all those people. He said he has never posted any inflammatory speeches on his official social media accounts, alleging there were many in the country who made inflammatory speeches, including AIMIM leaders in Telangana, who he said are never questioned by anyone.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-cops-get-tough-with-social-media-abusers-leave-politicians-untouched-127930

They were found to be involved in subversive and anti-national activities and were also found to be in touch with Abdullah Basith, who was already lodged in Tihar jail in another NIA case.The NIA officials said further investigations revealed that two more accused — Sadiya Anwar Sheikh and Nabeel Siddick Khatri — both residents of Pune, were part of the conspiracy to further the activities of the ISIS/ISKP in India and carry out subversive activities in the garb of anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests.“During interrogation, arrested accused Abdur Rahman confessed that he was conspiring with accused Jahanzaib Sami and other Syria-based ISIS operatives on secure messaging platforms to further ISIS activities. He was in the process of developing a medical application for helping the injured ISIS cadres in the conflict-zones and a weaponry-related application for the benefit of ISIS fighters,” a senior NIA official said.The official added that Rahman also confessed that he had visited an ISIS medical camp in Syria in early 2014 for treatment of the ISIS terrorists and stayed with the Islamic State operatives for 10 days before returning to India.After arresting him, the NIA carried out searches at three premises belonging to him in Bangalore with the assistance of Karnataka police and seized digital devices, mobile phone and a laptop containing incriminating material.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-arrests-bengaluru-based-ophthalmologist-for-allegedly-furthering-isis-cause-127926

18-08-2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh to reserve government jobs for locals||Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Tuesday said necessary legal provisions will be made to ensure that only local people get jobs in the state government.He also said resources of the state are meant for residents of the state.“The state (BJP) government has taken an important decision today that government jobs will be given only to youths of Madhya Pradesh. We are making necessary legal provisions for this purpose. Resources of Madhya Pradesh are meant for children of the state,” Chouhan said in a video statement.He, however, did not elaborate on the proposed legal provisions.Later in a tweet addressed to youths, the chief minister said:  “From today, the children of Madhya Pradesh will have the first right over the resources of Madhya Pradesh. All government jobs will be reserved only for the children of Madhya Pradesh. Our aim is to involve the local talents in the upliftment (sic) of the state”.An official statement quoted Chouhan as saying that students of the state will be taken in in government services and “necessary statutory provisions will be made to ensure this”.In his Independence Day speech, Chouhan had announced that preference would be given to local people in government jobs.He had also said his government will devise a mechanism to ensure employment to youths on the basis of their marksheets of classes 10 and 12.The then Kamal Nath-led Congress government had also announced to reserve 70 per cent of jobs in industrial units for locals.Reacting to the announcement made by the chief minister, Nath, who heads the state Congress unit, said: “Students and youths of the state should not be cheated again as had happened during the earlier 15-year stints of the BJP”.Nath demanded that the government make public the data on the number of youths who have been provided jobs by the BJP in its previous stints of 15 years.Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said he had been demanding that residents of the state get jobs in government.“Thank you for conceding my demand, Shivraj ji. But how to trust you till the issuance of government order in this regard? For what (you were) waiting for 15 years? You marred the rights of thousands of promising youths of Madhya Pradesh.Who is responsible for the corruption of Vyapam (job scam)?You and only you,” Singh tweeted.On the other hand, state BJP chief VD Sharma welcomed the announcement, saying it is an important step towards creating “Swarnim Madhya Pradesh”.Incidentally, the announcement comes around the time when by-elections for 27 seats in the state are expected to be held. Twenty-two of the 27 seats fell vacant when sitting MLAs who previously belonged to the Congress followed Jyrotiraditya Scindia out of the party three months ago. The mass resignation led to the collapse of the state government under Kamal Nath and propelled Shivraj Chouhan back into the chief minister’s chair less than two years after he was forced to vacate the seat for Nath’s Congress government. --- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/madhya-pradesh-to-reserve-government-jobs-for-locals-127921
18-08-2020|| New Delhi||41 lakh youth lose jobs in India due to COVID-19 impact: ILO-ADB report||As many as 41 lakh youth in the country lost jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic while construction and farm sector workers account for the majority of job losses, according to a joints report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).“For India, the report estimates job loss for 4.1 million youth. Construction and agriculture have witnessed the major job losses among seven key sectors,” said the ILO-ADB report, titled ‘Tackling the COVID-19 youth employment crisis in Asia and the Pacific’, released on Tuesday.The young people’s employment prospects in Asia and the Pacific are severely challenged due to the pandemic, it added.Youth (15–24 years) will be hit harder than adults (25 and older) in the immediate crisis and risk bearing higher longer-term economic and social costs, said the report.The report is based on regional assessment of the ‘Global Survey on Youth and COVID-19’ and arrived at estimates based on available unemployment data in different countries.It said in India, two-thirds of firm-level apprenticeships and three quarters of internships were completely interrupted during the pandemic.The report calls on governments in the region to adopt urgent, large-scale and targeted measures to generate jobs for the youth, keep education and training on track, and to minimise future scarring of more than 660 million young people in the region.Even before the COVID-19 crisis, youth in Asia and the Pacific faced challenges in the labour market, resulting in high unemployment rates and large shares of youth excluded from both school and work.In 2019, the regional youth unemployment rate was 13.8 per cent, compared to 3 per cent for adults; and more than 160 million youth (24 per cent of the population) were not in employment, education or training.Four in five young workers in the region were engaged in informal employment — a higher share than among adults — and one in four young workers was living in conditions of extreme or moderate poverty.“The pre-crisis challenges for youth are now amplified since COVID-19 hit. Without sufficient attention, our fear is that this risks creating a ‘lockdown generation’ that could feel the weight of this crisis for many years to come,” said Sara Elder, lead author of the report and head of the ILO Regional Economic and Social Analysis unit.The report cites three ways in which young people are affected in the current crisis. These are job disruptions in the form of reduced working hours and earnings, and job losses for both paid workers and the self-employed; disruptions in their education and training; and difficulties in transitioning from school to work, and moving between jobs in a recession.Youth unemployment rates in the region increased sharply in the first quarter of 2020 from the last quarter of 2019, it said.Compared to the first quarter of 2019, the youth unemployment rate increased in six of the nine economies with available data — Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam, as well as in Hong Kong, China, which showed the largest increase of 3 percentage points. In all these economies, youth rates increased more than adult rates, the report showed.Between 1 crore and 1.5 crore youth jobs (full-time equivalent) may be lost across 13 countries in Asia and the Pacific in 2020, according to the report’s projections.According to the report, a reasons young people in the region face greater labour market disruption and job losses than adults is that nearly half of them (more than 10 crore ) were employed in the four sectors hardest hit by the crisis. The sectors are wholesale and retail trade and repair; manufacturing; rental and business services; and accommodation and food services.Young women are over-represented in three of the four most-affected sectors, particularly in accommodation and food services, it said.Compounded by the forced suspension of education and training, the COVID-19 crisis will affect young people’s transitions to and within labour markets, and could result in scarring effects, as seen in previous crises, according to the report.It recommends urgent, large-scale and targeted responses, including youth-targeted wage subsidies and public employment programmes, and measures to mitigate the impact on students of the disruption to their education and training.Governments should consider balancing the inclusion of the youth in wider labour market and economic recovery measures, with youth-targeted interventions to maximise effective allocation of resources.“Prioritising youth employment in the COVID-19 recovery process will improve Asia and the Pacific’s future prospects for inclusive and sustainable growth, demographic transition and social stability,” said Chris Morris, head of the ADB NGO and civil society center and leading ADB’s Youth for Asia initiative. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/41-lakh-youth-lose-jobs-in-india-due-to-covid-19-impact-ilo-adb-report-127911

Mumbai police don’t listen to me and take the probe to a completely different direction. My daughter could enter the room where my son’s body was hanging only after the body was reportedly brought down. Nobody in the family has seen his body hanging,” KK Singh had told the top court.He had urged the court to put its seal of approval on the CBI probe also demanded by Rhea sometime back.On behalf of the CBI, Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta had said: “The only pending investigation is in Bihar. Whether it is valid or not... can’t be decided in a transfer petition.”He had pointed out that the affidavit filed by Mumbai Police used the word “investigation” without registering an FIR under the CrPC. “If it was just an inquest, there can’t be an investigation,” Mehta had said, adding, an inquest proceeding could not be a substitute for an investigation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rhea-cant-give-certificate-to-herself-on-alleged-money-transfer-from-sushants-account-kk-singhs-lawyer-127906

While satisfying signs are visible there is no reason to slacken the guard,” Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, adding that the top achievement of the last week was India reaching a three crore cumulative testing mark with record tests of 8,99,864 in the last 24 hours.Bhushan said the fact that average weekly COVID positivity in India was declining despite rising tests was reassuring and aggressive testing was key to disease control.Member (Health), NITI Aayog, VK Paul while noting that India’s hold on pandemic control was intact said this hold could loosen if people became callous and started attending large gathering and shunning masks.On vaccines Paul, who heads the India expert COVID vaccine administration group, said the three vaccines under trial in India were on track and the government had asked the manufacturers to share pricing expectations and also share their production capacities.Paul said no timeline could be given as to when a vaccine would be ready but progress was satisfactory.He said while the Oxford vaccine would enter phase 3 human trials tomorrow, the two indigenous vaccines were in phase 1 and 2 trials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reassuring-signs-emerging-on-covid-control-but-no-time-to-lower-guard-govt-127905

No Indian will be left behind,” he said.After a gap of two months due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, India resumed domestic passenger flights on May 25.However, average occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around just 50-60 per cent since May 25.Currently, airlines in India are permitted to operate 45 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights.The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the coronavirus pandemic.All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, leave-without-pay and firings of employees in order to conserve cash.

18-08-2020||Santiniketan||Visva Bharati demands CBI probe, central forces after campus violence||Visva Bharati on Tuesday demanded a CBI inquiry into the August 17 campus violence for which it blamed a ruling TMC MLA and some other ruling party leaders, and asserted the prestigious central university will remain closed until the perpetrators are brought to book.The University has also decided to seek Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention for the deployment of central security forces on its premises, a development that could be a potential flashpoint with the state government. The prime minister is the chancellor of the university.The vandalism at the prestigious university, founded by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, has snowballed into a major political row, after some ruling TMC supporters and varsity authorities filed police complaints against each other.West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar threw his weight behind the university, which accused the local TMC MLA Naresh Barui of masterminding the violence.Dhankhar Tuesday wrote to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, urging her to initiate stern action against the perpetrators as “panic and atmosphere of fear” is prevailing at Santiniketan.The Birbhum district TMC leadership blamed the vice- chancellor, the university’s “arrogant approach”, and “outsiders imported by the varsity” for Monday’s mayhem.The heritage university was shut down indefinitely on Monday following violent protests against Visva Bharati’s decision to construct a boundary wall around the venue of Poush Mela, a prestigious annual cultural event started more than a century ago.According to Shyam Singh, the Birbhum district superintendent of police, nine persons have been arrested for the campus violence.Palpable tension prevailed at the institute with barely any movement seen on Tuesday morning.The university filed a police complaint against Bauri, the Trinamool Congress MLA from Dubrajpur, who is also a former student of Visva Bharati, and two other TMC leaders, who were present when violence took place.Bauri denied any involvement and said he was present in the peaceful protest not as a TMC leader but as a former student of the university.According to police sources, locals have also filed complaints against university officials, including Vice- Chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty, blaming them for the violence.Calling the complaints “false”, the university demanded their immediate withdrawal.“Unless the miscreants, who committed vandalism along with TMC leaders at the lead, are booked and until we are at ease through the creation of condition in which the members of the university are free from bodily harm and humiliation, Visva Bharati would remain closed,” the university said in a press statement Tuesday evening.The varsity also demanded that police withdraw the “false FIRs” slapped on the vice-chancellor and other university officials or else campus won’t be free from “threat of humiliation and violence”.Police said they have received complaints from both sides and are looking into them.“The executive council (of the university) has unanimously decided to write to the honourable chancellor (the prime minister) for the deployment of any of the central security forces to deal with security issues on the campus,” one of its members told PTI.Meanwhile, a senior professor of the institution has alleged a group of protesters ransacked his residence early Tuesday, hours after the decision to close the university was announced.Biplab Lohachowdhury, the head of the university’s journalism department, also said he has filed a police complaint and written to the registrar of the institute to intimate him about the incident.A senior police officer in Birbhum said an FIR has been lodged in the case and the matter is under investigation.Governor Dhankhar, who expressed his dismay over the turn of events, while urging Banerjee to act tough with the perpetrators of the violence, called it an “organised crime”.“I would urge to take a proactive stance and ensure exemplary consequence to the lawbreakers,” he said, adding it was baffling to “note the non-responsive stance” of the police and administration to the appeals of the varsity.State BJP president Dilip Ghosh claimed “vested interests” are trying to grab the land of Visva Bharati in tacit understanding with the local TMC leadership.Trouble erupted on Monday after the fencing work began on the fair ground, with thousands of protesters vandalising construction equipment and tearing down the main gate.The Trinamool Congress government condemned the violence but threw its weight behind the protesters.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she was against any construction at the site and asked the district administration to convene a meeting of the stakeholders.The university authorities, however, insisted a fence around the fair venue was required be built to honour an order of the National Green Tribunal, which had on November 1, 2017, said that a “barrier needs to be constructed to demarcate the Mela ground from the university and the locality.”    University officials said they will hold a 12-hour fast to protest the violence on the campus the date for which will be announced later.

Even with such a high level of testing, the positivity has remained low, i.e., 8.81 per cent compared to the weekly national average of 8.84 per cent,” the Ministry said.Also read: Marginal decline in coronavirus cases for fourth day in a rowIndia also recorded the highest single-day recoveries of 57,937 in a span of 24 hours, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated at 8 am on Tuesday.It is higher than the 55,079 confirmed cases of coronavirus added during the same period, the ministry highlighted.With more patients recovering and being discharged from hospitals and home isolation (in case of mild and moderate cases), the total recoveries have surged to 19,77,779.“With this the gap between recovered patients and active cases has crossed 13 lakh as on date (13,04,613),” the Ministry said.The continuous increase in average daily recoveries has led to India’s COVID-19 recovery rate rising to 73.18 per cent and a low case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.92 per cent, it said.As a result of collaborative and focussed efforts by the Centre, the state and UT governments built on effective implementation of the ‘test, track and treat’ strategy of the Union government.“A total of 30 states and UTs, including Chhattisgarh, Assam, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Jharkhand, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka, are reporting lower CFR than the national average,” it stated.“Aggressive testing leads to early identification and isolation of positive cases. This coupled with efficient clinical treatment has ensured low Fatality Rate,” the Ministry underlined.The actual caseload of the country — 6,73,166 active cases of coronavirus infection — is only 24.91 per cent of the total cases, it said.An ever-expanding national network of diagnostic labs has ensured the exponentially growing number of tests being conducted across the country. As on date, 1,476 labs are operational, with 971 labs in the government sector and 505 private labs.

This ‘invisible’ shield can be used in various military stealth applications and can cover electromagnetic wave emitter or absorber devices without compromising aesthetics.Besides the physical shape, reducing the electromagnetic signature, which includes radar waves and radio signals, is an important element for enhancing the stealth capability of a weapon platform.These transparent and flexible EMI shields have been fabricated by scientists at the Centre for Nano and Soft Matter Sciences (CeNS) from metal meshes using the crack templating method and spray coating, which is pioneered in their laboratory. These can be used instead of a continuous film coating on the desired substrates or surface.The CeNS team has developed a copper metal mesh on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheet as its substrate, which is claimed to have exhibited a visible transmittance, a parameter of visible transparency, of about 85 per cent.Instead of a continuous film coating of a metal like copper on any transparent substrate such as glass or PET, where transparency can be compromised, the CeNS team deposited metal mesh networks on the substrate, which covered only seven per cent of the substrate’s area. This metal mesh can be created on any desired substrates such as acrylic, polycarbonate, glass, etc. without compromising the conductivity of the electrodes.This makes metal mesh transparent compared to the continuous metal film that covers the entire area of the substrate. A metal mesh is said to provide better electromagnetic shielding compared to the same thickness of the continuous metal film. The team’s findings, published in the journal ‘Bulletin of Materials Science’, showed remarkably high values for total EMI shielding.“This invention has the potential to satisfy the huge demand for highly effective transparent and flexible EMI shields, which can cover electromagnetic wave emitter and absorber devices without compromising their aesthetics,” Dr Ashutosh K Singh, scientist working on this project at CeNS, said.The team lead by Prof GU Kulkarni, along with his co-workers from CeNS and an industrial partner, Hind High Vacuum Private Limited, have set-up a semi-automated production plant funded by Department of Science and Technology’s Nanomission in the CeNS campus for production of transparent conducting glasses which shows the potential for transparent EMI shields as well.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/invisible-shield-developed-to-add-stealth-capability-to-military-platforms-127883

That is not right,” he said.Regarding questions on ‘hate speech’ by the BJP supporters, he referred to the ‘aar paar ki ladai’ comment by Congress president Sonia Gandhi as well as another comment made by senior leader Rahul Gandhi, where he said “youth will beat the Prime Minister with canes”. He questioned whether they were not “textbook cases of hate speech and instigating violence”.“There are two issues. One relates to what is published in an international journal — that is for Facebook to decide. It is their policy and system. As far as Rahul Gandhi’s allegations are concerned, I have already reacted and that remains the party’s stance on the issue,” the IT Minister said.Reminding Rahul Gandhi of his party’s “alliance with Cambridge Analytica”, Prasad on Monday had said: “Losers who cannot influence people even in their own party keep cribbing that the entire world is controlled by the BJP and the RSS. You were caught red-handed in an alliance with Cambridge Analytica and Facebook to weaponise data before the elections and now have the gall to question us?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-platform-in-question-is-public-every-indian-has-right-to-convey-views-ravi-shankar-prasad-127882

It also will decide whether states have the power under the National Disaster Management Act to defer final-year examinations till situation normalises.Apart from some students, governments of Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha and Delhi have questioned the UGC’s July 6 circular asking universities to conduct final-year examinations by September 30.These states maintained that students could be promoted without examination in view of the extraordinary situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The top court had earlier refused to stay the UGC circular.The UGC, which regulates higher education in India, had refused to relent on the September 30 deadline for conducting final-year examinations of universities and colleges.The UGC told the Supreme Court that the decision was taken “after due deliberation by taking into account and balancing all relevant factors”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-reserves-verdict-on-petitions-challenging-mandating-final-year-university-exams-by-sept-30-127876

It has been made for Covid-type emergencies," he said, calling it very different from PM NRF. ``It is not like the family run Rajiv Gandhi Foundation which also received money from China and also PM NRF,’’ said Prasad  "Transparency is writ large in the PM CARES Fund both in the terms of legal requirements and management of funds received in an voluntary basis," Prasad added, adding that the Narendra Modi government works with complete honesty which is why it also receives blessings from the people. "The same honesty can be seen in the PM Cares Fund," he said  The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a PIL seeking transfer of money collected under the PM CARES Fund for the COVID-19 pandemic to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF). BJP president JP Nadda called the "verdict by Supreme Court on PM CARES is a resounding blow to the nefarious designs of Rahul Gandhi and his band of ‘rent a cause’ activists.

18-08-2020||New Delhi||Satya Pal Malik appointed Meghalaya Governor||Satya Pal Malik was on Tuesday transferred as Governor of the northeastern state of Meghalaya, replacing Tathagata Roy who completed his five-year tenure on the gubernatorial post.A Rashtrapati Bhavan communique said Malik has been shifted to Meghalaya, and Governor of Maharashtra Bhagat Singh Koshyari has been asked to discharge the functions of Goa governor in addition to his own duties.There was, however, no mention of Roy, who completed his five-year tenure by serving as governor of Tripura for three years and the remaining in Meghalaya. There is no fixed tenure for governors, but conventionally it is considered for a period of five years. There have been examples in the past where governors have served for a longer period like that of E S L Narasimhan, who served continuously for 12 years in Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh (undivided) and later in Telangana.Roy, who would turn 75 next month, had stoked a controversy last year when he supported a tweet by a retired army official calling for banning of Kashmiri goods in the aftermath of an attack on the CRPF convoy that killed 40 security personnel.As the news of the new appointment reached Shillong, Roy tweeted, "Upon receipt of news from Rashtrapati Bhavan I spoke to Shri Satyapal Malikji, the new Governor-Designate and welcomed him to Shillong. It may take him a little time to come here."          "I was supposed to have been relieved on 20th May. Now the end of the road is in sight!" he said.Roy was appointed governor of Meghalaya in August 2018 and continued till date, barring absence between December 2019 to January 2020 when he was on leave.  Malik (73) was the last governor of erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir before it was divided into two union territories -- Ladakh and JK-- on October 31 last year. The announcement in this regard was made on August 5 last year when the Centre abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/satya-pal-malik-appointed-meghalaya-governor-127869

Specifically, the article states ‘Ms Das (of Facebook India) has provided the BJP with favourable treatment on election-related issues. This is a damning and serious allegation of Facebook India’s interference in India’s electoral democracy,” said Venugopal seeking a probe.He said “it is deeply disturbing that your company may be a willing participant in thwarting the very rights and values that our founding leaders sacrificed their lives for” and added that the WSJ revelations are “not surprising”.Noting that other political parties had also raised this issue in India’s Parliament, Venugopal demanded that Facebook set up a high-level inquiry into Facebook India leadership operations and submit a report to the board of Facebook within one or two months.“This report should also be made public. Also, publish all instances of hate speech posts since 2014 that were allowed on the platform,” the General-Secretary added.The Congress said in the letter that it had separately demanded a parliamentary probe into Facebook’s “interference with the larger electoral democracy” in the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-writes-to-mark-zuckerberg-over-alleged-bias-demands-probe-into-conduct-of-india-leadership-team-127868
18-08-2020||New Delhi||Aviation Ministry to present proposal on ‘further’ airport privatisation to Cabinet on Wed: Puri||The Ministry of Civil Aviation will place a proposal for “further” privatisation of airports before the Union Cabinet on Wednesday, Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said.In the first round of privatisation under the Narendra Modi dispensation, the airports in Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram and Guwahati were cleared for operation, management and development through public-private partnership (PPP) model in February 2019.Subsequently, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) had in September 2019 recommended the Civil Aviation Ministry to privatise airports in Amritsar, Varanasi, Bhubaneswar, Indore, Raipur and Trichy.Puri, during a webinar on Tuesday, said: “We are going to the Cabinet tomorrow for further airport privatisation. We have got many more airports lined up, dozens of them, and the 100 new airports we will build between now and 2030.”The AAI, which works under the Ministry of Civil Aviation, owns and manages more than 100 airports across the country.Adani Enterprises had won the rights to run six airports — Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Mangaluru, Thiruvananthapuram, and Guwahati — after a competitive bidding process in February 2019.Adani Enterprises signed the concessionaire agreement with the AAI for three airports — Ahmedabad, Mangaluru and Lucknow — on February 14, 2020. It is yet to sign the concessionaire agreement for the other three airports.In June this year, the AAI gave three more months to the Adani group to take over the management of the airports of Ahmedabad, Mangaluru and Lucknow due to the COVID-19 scenario.This means the Adani group, which was expected to take over the operations, management and development of the three airports by August 12, can now take over the airports by November 12.Around 94,000 passengers travelled through domestic flights on Monday, Puri said at the aforementioned webinar organised by industry body Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).Prior to COVID-19 pandemic, around 3 lakh passengers per day travelled domestically in India, he said.“By the time we reach Diwali, we would be 50 to 55 per cent of our pre-COVID figures. By the end of the year, we will revive civil aviation to pre-COVID levels,” he mentioned.After a gap of two months due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, India resumed domestic passenger flights on May 25, albeit in a curtailed manner.Currently, airlines in India are permitted to operate 45 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights.International passenger flights continue to remain suspended in the country.However, since July, India has signed separate bilateral air bubble agreements with countries like the US, the UAE, Germany and France under which airlines of both the countries in a pact can operate international flights with certain restrictions.The aviation sector has been hit hard due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March this year, all airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures like pay cuts, leave without pay and firings of employees.

As the flood water reached knee-length, the mummy preserved in the box had to be taken out to a safe place, said Dr. Rakesh Chholak, Superintendent of Central Museum. Had there been a delay of even a few minutes, this mummy which was brought from Egypt to Rajasthan more than a century ago would have been destroyed forever. Therefore, it's glass cover was smashed and the mummy was put in a safe place.The mummy displayed at the Albert Hall Museum was brought from Cairo 130 years back. It is of a woman named Tutu. It was found in the Akhmin area of the ancient city of Panopolis in Egypt.In April 2017, the mummy was shifted to the basement of the Albert Hall in Jaipur and all related details of its history, birth-death relationship, the method of making mummy and X-ray of this mummy were presented to the people here.Even the Archaeological Department head office was flooded with water, department files were drenched. The officials, since the last four days, have been trying to dry these files by spreading them in open spaces.The tourist's entry has been closed for seven days, said Prakash Chandra Sharma, Director, Department of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Rajasthan. He said, "All files were drenched due to water rising up to five feet in the office.

This has led us to lose some of our exceptionally bright and caring students and part of our family due to self-harm," Guleria said, reassuring that AIIMS will do everything possible to prevent its recurrence.Alluding to a survey conducted by British Medical Journal, the AIIMS Director said that 30 per cent of students experience or have received treatment for mental health issues. He rued that it is a huge number, much more that what is seen in the general population."The American Medical Student Association stated that the cycle of stress, anxiety and depression takes place during medical school since students frequently lack time for enough sleep, healthy eating, regular exercise and smaller support system. I think that is something we need to work on," he added.Guleria, who is also the part of a core team monitoring the pandemic, said that the Coronavirus has itself taken a toll on mental health. "We, as a community, thrive on social interaction and freedom and we are suddenly forced into a life of isolation, fear and restrictions. Although we talk of physical distancing, we really do not want that there should be any social distancing." To deal with the issue of suicide, he said that there is a 24x7 students wellness wing led by Pratap Saran and the department of psychiatry. Five clinical psychologists run the wing.Besides this, there is a mobile helpline and email which is available 24x7, emergency support from the department of psychiatry, skill development workshop to help in stress management, communication skills, system for providing financial assistance to students belonging to deprived backgrounds, eleven wellness clubs. A wellness website is also near completion.Last week, the Faculty Association of AIIMS had shot a letter to the Director raising concerns over the recent suicides among undergraduate students at the institute. The letter stated there is a need to collectively think and work to provide an enabling environment for the students to prosper.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aiims-lost-exceptionally-bright-students-to-self-harm-guleria-127854

18-08-2020||New Delhi||SC refuses to direct transfer of contributions made to PM CARES to NDRF||The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a PIL seeking transfer of money collected under the PM CARES Fund for the COVID-19 pandemic to the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).A Bench, led by Justice Ashok Bhushan, ruled that PM CARES fund need not be transferred to NDRF. It's open to anyone to contribute to PM Cares Fund, it said.The plan prepared by the government under NDRF was sufficient even for COVID-19, it said, adding the action plan under NDRF was sufficient and no fresh action plan for tackling COVID-19 was required.It said the Centre can utilise the NDRF fund for COVID-19 relief."Any contribution or grant can be credited to NDRF. It's open for anyone to contribute to NDRF as voluntary contributions", the top court said, adding there was no statutory prohibition to making a contribution to NDRF by any person or institution.The Supreme Court had on July 27 reserved its order on a PIL seeking transfer of money collected under the PM CARES Fund for the COVID-19 pandemic to NDRF.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had told the Bench that the PM CARES Fund is a "voluntary fund" while funds to the NDRF and SDRF are made available through budgetary allocations.Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, representing petitioner Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), had said the NGO didn't doubt the bona fides of anyone but the creation of the PM CARES Fund violated provisions of the National Disaster Management Act.He had claimed the NDRF was being audited by the Comptroller and Auditor-General (CAG) but the government has said the audit of the PM CARES Fund will be done by private auditors.The Centre has been defending PM Cares Funds, saying the existence of National Disaster Relief Fund didn't prohibit the establishment of a new fund.In an affidavit filed in the top court last month, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had said PM CARES Find provided for voluntary donations to be made to it and there was no need to transfer donations received in one fund to another.The Supreme Court had on June 17 issued notice to the Centre and sought to know if a National Plan under NDMA had been framed or not.The petitioner had alleged that the Centre was not divulging information about specific utilization of crores of rupees received in the PM CARES Fund till date.But the MHA said, "There are several funds which are either established earlier or now for carrying out various relief works. PM Cares is one such fund with voluntary donations. The mere existence of a statutory fund would not prohibit in the creation of a different fund like PM Cares Fund which provides for voluntary donations."To the petitioner's demand for transfer of money from PM CARES Fund to NDRF account, the MHA said such a prayer was not maintainable under Article 32 of the Constitution "as all funds other than the funds stipulated under Section 46 of Disaster Management Act, 2005, are separate, different and distinct created under separate provisions."The MHA affidavit also questioned the petitioner's motive behind filing the PIL, saying it had been only dealing with filing PILs since the concept of PIL originated.An empowered group formed by the government was working closely with 92,000 genuine NGOs across India to chart out the best course of the response, it submitted.To petitioner's demand for a preparing a national plan in consultation with the state governments and experts, the MHA said, currently, there was no such national plan in place to deal with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic even though the same had been notified as a ‘disaster’ and numerous notifications are being issued to contain the same under the DM Act.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-direct-transfer-of-contributions-made-to-pm-cares-to-ndrf-127845

Cite one example where I could be blamed for any social strife," he said.He claimed many social media accounts have been opened across the country in his name and said it was not possible for him to stop all those people.He said he cannot be held responsible if somebody shared or posted something."My official Facebook account was hacked and blocked in 2018," he said, adding he lodged a complaint with the police in this connection but that there has been no reply so far.He never posted any inflammatory speeches on his official social media accounts, Singh contended.Alleging there were many in the country who made inflammatory speeches, including AIMIM leaders in Telangana, he said nobody initiated action against them.He sought to know why he was being targeted and said it was 'wrong.'The legislator said he would continue to work in the national interest.A slugfest had erupted between the Congress and the BJP following a report in the Wall Street Journal claiming that Facebook ignored applying its hate speech rules to politicians of the BJP.Seizing on the report, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had accused the BJP and RSS of spreading "fake news" using Facebook and WhatsApp to influence the electorate, triggering a sharp counter-attack from Union IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad who reminded the opposition party of the Cambridge Analytica issue.Congress and the CPI (M) have demanded a probe by a joint parliamentary committee into the issue.

Since May this year, the patrolling routes have been denied to the Indian Army at a location north of Pangong Tso and in parts of Depsang plains.China on Monday said it was ready to work with India to enhance political mutual trust, properly manage differences and safeguard the long-term development of bilateral ties.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said this at a regular briefing when a journalist sought China’s reaction to PM Narendra Modi’s remarks that the Indian armed forces had given a befitting reply to those challenging the country’s sovereignty.Modi, in his 74th Independence Day address to the nation, said the armed forces had given a befitting reply to those challenging the country’s sovereignty “from LoC to LAC”, in a veiled reference to Pakistan and China.Responding to the question, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao said: “We have noted Prime Minister Modi’s speech…. We are close neighbours... the sound development of bilateral ties not only serves the interest of the two peoples but also stability, peace, prosperity of the region and the whole world.”“So, China stands ready to work with India to enhance our political mutual trust, properly manage our differences, step-up practical cooperation and safeguard the development of bilateral ties,” he added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-talks-peace-belies-ground-reality-127617

SBI reportIn May, Ecowrap had estimated Q1 FY21 GDP contraction at over 20 per cent and now pegs it at much lower contraction of 16.5 per cent for the quarter, “though with the relevant caveats in the current uncertain scenario”, the research report released on Monday stated.It said degrowth in corporate GVA (better than expected results of some financial and non-financial companies) has been significantly better than revenue degrowth in Q1 FY21 as far as the results of the listed companies are concerned.So far, around 1,000 listed entities have announced their results for the first quarter. The results indicate more than 25 per cent decline in topline and more than 55 per cent decline in bottomline.However, it is interesting to mention that the decline in corporate GVA (gross value added) is only 14.1 per cent, it said. “In principle, revenue decline of listed companies has been far outstripped by cost rationalisation, thereby not impacting margins,” the report said.It said in July and August, coronavirus significantly penetrated the rural areas. The percentage of cases in rural districts to total new cases has risen to 54 per cent in August. Also, the number of rural districts with less than 10 cases has reduced significantly. Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra have been impacted more severely with increasing coronavirus penetration in rural areas. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gdp-to-shrink-16-5-in-1st-quarter-sbi-report-127675

18-08-2020||Nonika Singh||His divine notes took us to another realm||A life lived to the full, one which enriched saat suron ki duniya as few have or can. The very mention of the name Pandit Jasraj ushers in melody. The very embodiment of saat swar, alas the divine notes that took us to another world have fallen silent.To even utter the words, ‘the indomitable vocalist is no more’, sounds like a disservice to his immense contribution, for vocalists like him remain as eternal as their ethereal notes which never failed to cast a magical spell.A Padma Vibushan recipient, he epitomised Bharatiya sanskar not merely because he represented its great classical tradition, but more precisely since he lived it in his very being and propagated the same. Those who have known him would always remember his ebullient greeting, Jai Ho. Those who have heard him would always swear by his vocal range, the mastery over ragas and his unique Jasrangi style with which he vowed listeners in India and abroad, young and old alike. Call it experimentation or inspiration, the purist was not hemmed by tradition yet drew from its deep wells. Representing Mewati gharana, the Jasrangi style too he insisted came from the ancient tradition of “moorchana”, where a male and female vocalist would render the same raga.Born in Hisar in 1930, he would hail his home state as ‘janani janambhoomi’ and would often perform there. His musical journey began with grasping the rudiments first from his father and later his elder brother, Pandit Maniram. He also trained with Jaiwant Singh Waghela, a vocalist and “beenkar”, and Gulam Qadir Khan of Mewati gharana. The world would not just know him as a doyen of an illustrious gharana, but as a creator and an innovator who would add new chapters to musical history. Swar was the key to all he created. As he added one after another bandish to the musical lexicon, he would bridge many divides, including religious with his Allah Om compositions. If he would popularise old Haveli Sangeet style, equally easily he could reach out to young listeners, many of whom worshipped him like God.Though married to filmmaker V Shantaram’s daughter, film music did not beckon him strongly enough. But for occasional and equally impressive forays, a jugalbandi with Bhimsen Joshi in “Birbal My Brother” and a song in “Life of Pi”, he believed, “sab ki apni raah.” Many, however, would walk his musical path and today his disciples too have earned a place for themselves. In direct communion with gods, he would often say how God makes him sing and He alone listens. The ordinary mortals who saw divinity in him would sorely miss the divine connection.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/his-divine-notes-took-us-to-another-realm-127701
