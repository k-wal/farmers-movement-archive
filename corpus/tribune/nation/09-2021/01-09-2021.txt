He also assisted the party in Punjab and was Chief Minister Amarinder Singh’s adviser, a post he quit recently.

He was sent to judicial custody by the court.Some persons thrashed Ali in the Govind Nagar area of Indore on August 22 apparently for using a ‘fake’ name while selling bangles to women in the locality.The incident caused uproar after a video of the thrashing went viral. In another video, which was also circulated widely, a man was seen beating the bangle seller and egging on others to join him.Four persons were arrested for assaulting Ali, police had said.As per the FIR lodged by the minor girl, a student of class 6, on August 23 at Banganga police station, Ali came to her house to sell bangles and identified himself as Golu, son of one Mohan Singh. He allegedly touched her inappropriately while calling her “very beautiful”, the FIR stated.Ali had left behind his bag during pandemonium in which two Aadhaar cards were found including one which mentioned his name as Aslim, son of Mor Singh and another one as Tasleem, son of Mohar Ali, police said.A burnt voter ID card was also found in the goods of the bangle seller on which the name of the holder is not clear, but ‘Mohan Singh’ is visible in the column of the holder’s father, officials said.

01-09-2021||New Delhi||Hate speech: Court remands Pinky Chaudhary to one-day police custody||A Delhi court on Wednesday remanded Pinky Chaudhary, president of Hindu Rakshak Dal, to one-day police custody for allegedly raising communal slogans and inciting the youth to propagate against a particular religion in a rally at Jantar Mantar here last month.Metropolitan Magistrate Prayank Nayak allowed Delhi Police to quiz Chaudhary for a day after the probe agency said his custodial interrogation was required for August 8 incident.The accused had surrendered before the police yesterday as the Delhi High Court recently refused to grant him any interim protection.Earlier a trial court had dismissed his anticipatory bail application, saying “we are not a Taliban State.”The court had said that in past such incidents have fared communal tensions leading to riots and loss to life and property.“We are not Taliban State. Rule of law is the sacrosanct governing principle in our plural and multi-cultural society. While the whole of India is celebrating ‘azadi ka amrut mahotsav’ there are some minds still chained with intolerant and self-centric beliefs,” the judge had said.Delhi Police had on August 10 arrested six people- Ashwani Upadhyay (advocate), Vinod Sharma, Deepak Singh, Vineet Bajpai, Preet Singh and Deepak Kumar—in connection with inflammatory sloganeering near Jantar Mantar.On August 11, advocate Ashwani Upadhyay was released on bail.

01-09-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi releases special commemorative coin on ISKCON founder's 125th birth anniversary||Prime Minister Narendra Modi released a special commemorative coin of Rs 125 on Wednesday to mark the 125th birth anniversary of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) founder Srila Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.Speaking on the occasion through video-conferencing, Modi lauded the religious organisation for its work and services, and said that it has played the role of a brand ambassador of Indian traditions and values.Citing ISKCON's global presence, the prime minister said he often gives the example of its success while speaking of 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat', a programme launched by his government to popularise "made-in-India" products."How we feel a sense of belonging and pride when we are greeted with 'Hare Krishna' in foreign countries. Imagine how we will feel if we find the same familiarity for 'made-in-India' products outside," the prime minister said.Hare Krishna' is the greeting offered by ISKCON members.Prabhupada arrived in New York with little idea about his next meal or where he will stay, and his subsequent success in popularising ISKCON is, Modi said quoting former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, no less than a miracle.ISKCON has told the world that for India, faith means zest, enthusiasm and faith in humanity, he said, and also lauded its service to people during various crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic.Prabhupada was not only an extraordinary devotee of Lord Krishna but was also a devotee to India, Modi said, noting his association with the freedom movement.Modi said when India was in "slavery", the Bhakti movement kept its spirit alive, and added that scholars assess that if there was no social revolution that time then it would be difficult to imagine the country's fate.Bhakti connected the creature with God by removing the discrimination of faith, social hierarchies and privileges, he said."If a sage like Swami Vivekananda took Vedanta to the west, then Srila Prabhupada and ISKCON took up this great task of taking Bhakti Yoga to the world when the time came. He connected Bhakti Vedanta with the consciousness of the world," he said.It is our resolve that the world should benefit from our knowledge of Yoga and Ayurveda, Modi added.Prabhupada had founded ISKCON, commonly known as the "Hare Krishna movement".ISKCON has translated the Shrimad Bhagavad Geeta and other Vedic literature in 89 languages, playing a stellar role in the dissemination of Vedic literature across the world, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) had earlier said.He has also established over a hundred temples and wrote several books.

01-09-2021||New Delhi||1 in 3 Delhi adolescents report airway obstruction/asthma due to pollution: Study||A study evaluating the lung health status of 3,157 adolescent school children has revealed alarming findings showing high prevalence of symptoms related to asthma and allergy, airway obstruction and childhood obesity.In a first, the study by Lung Care Foundation and Pulmocare Research and Education Foundation across 12 randomly selected private schools in Delhi, Kottayam, and Mysuru, has also shown that obese children had a 79 per cent greater chance of having asthma.The aim was to assess the respiratory health of adolescents in private schools in Delhi and compare them with relatively cleaner cities in terms of particulate matter air pollution—Kottayam and Mysuru.On all indicators, Delhi’s children were more vulnerable.In Delhi, 52.8 per cent school children reported sneezing, 44.9 per cent reported itchy watery eyes, 38.4 per cent significant cough, 33 per cent itchy rash, 31.5 per cent reported shortness of breath, 11.2 per cent reported chest tightness, and 8.75 per cent reported eczema.In Kottayam and Mysuru, corresponding proportions were lesser -- 39.3 per cent; 28.8 per cent; 18.9 per cent; 12.1 per cent; 10.8 per cent; 4.7 per cent; and 1.8 per cent respectively.Nearly 1 in 3 children from Delhi had airflow obstruction or asthma on spirometry test as compared to 22.6 per cent children in Kottayam and Mysuru. This difference was despite the fact that two factors associated with childhood asthma, namely family history of asthma and smoking in the family, were more prevalent in Kottayam and Mysuru.High prevalence of obesity and higher incidence of asthma was also noted in Delhi children, with 39.8 per cent children obese as compared to 16.4 per cent from Kottayam and Mysuru.The study shows that obese children had a 79 per cent greater chance of having asthma on spirometry across all three sites combined. This association was 38 per cent higher in Delhi children as compared to their counterparts.“The association between obesity and overweight in children and higher prevalence of asthma is being reported for the first time in any study from India. It is high time that the air pollution issue in Delhi and other cities is settled in a systematic manner to save the future of our children,” Arvind Kumar, Founder Trustee Lung Care Foundation and lead study author said.The study has been published in a leading peer-reviewed medical journal, Lung India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1-in-3-delhi-adolescents-report-airway-obstruction-asthma-due-to-pollution-study-305109

All three victims are members of the same family and include a woman.The Inthezargunj police suspects it to be a case of personal rivalry. Two other members of the family who were attacked were injured but managed to survive, they were later taken to Warangal’s MGM Hospital. The injured are stated to be stable. Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Warangal, Giri Kumar, told the media that the deceased was identified as Mohammad Chand Pasha, his wife, and his brother-in-law.  He said according to preliminary information, a group of 8-10 people came to the house and broke open the door. Hearing the noise, when the people in the house came to check, they were hacked to death one after the other.  Police suspect the crime took place over financial issues as Mohammad Chand Pasha is a cattle trader. As per preliminary information, there was a financial tiff between Chand Pasha and his brother Mohammad Shafi. Pasha’s daughter, who witnessed the incident, shared the information with the police.  Meanwhile, the commission appointed in the infamous Disha case resumed its enquiry today. These three members, namely former Supreme Court Judge VS Sirpurkar, former Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) chief DR Karthikeyan and former Bombay High Court judge RP Sondurbaldota started their inquiry into the Disha encounter case in the first week of February 2020.  In this case, on the night of November 28, 2019, a young veterinary doctor was kidnapped and later gang-raped and murdered. The perpetrators then dumped her body on the outskirts of Hyderabad and burnt it.  The four accused Chennakesavulu, Jollu Shiva, Jollu Naveen and Mohammad Arif were arrested and later killed in a police encounter when they were taken to the crime site. On December 12, 2019, the Supreme Court appointed a three-member inquiry committee to probe the circumstances that led to the killing of the four accused. On August 21 this year, the three-member inquiry commission commenced the first schedule of the cross-examination of witnesses.

01-09-2021||New Delhi||Rahul Gandhi doing what he is best at, spreading ‘falsities’ & ‘lies’: BJP on fuel price issue||The BJP on Wednesday accused Rahul Gandhi of spreading “falsities” and speaking “lies”, soon after the Congress leader attacked the Modi government over the issue of fuel price rise.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said an LPG cylinder price was Rs 1,241 on January 1, 2014 and Rs 1,080 on March 1 in the same year, when the Congress-led UPA government was in power, against Rs 834 it costs now.He noted that Gandhi quoted the subsidised price during the UPA government while referred to non-subsidised cost of the cylinder during the BJP government.“Rahul Gandhi has yet again done what he is best at. He has spread falsities and he has lied,” Patra told PTI, accusing the Congress leader of giving misleading information on the proposed monetisation scheme as well.Noting Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s statement, he said the government has also had to deal with the legacy fallout of the oil bonds worth Rs 1.4 lakh crore issued by the UPA dispensation.After Gandhi took a jibe at the government by referring to the GDP rise as gas, diesel and petrol price increase, the BJP leader hit back saying, “Those who ran a government of CNP—corruption, nepotism and policy paralysis—are trying to spread falsity about India’s GDP.”           The “historic” rise of 20.1 percent in the GDP in the first quarter this fiscal following an over 24 percent contraction during the corresponding period in the last fiscal underscores Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decisive leadership, he said.Patra accused Gandhi of lying that the government was selling off its assets through monetisation, asserting that it has made clear that they will be leased out for a specific period and money will be used for the public good.The ownership will remain with the government, he noted.Patra said Gandhi could not give a “straight” answer to a question on whether the Congress-ruled states will slash VAT on oil prices to reduce their prices.“It shows the Congress is all about talk but doing nothing,” he said.Gandhi on Wednesday slammed the government over the rising price of domestic cooking gas, diesel and petrol, and alleged that an amount of Rs 23 lakh crore has been earned by increasing prices of these commodities in the last seven years.He also alleged that while sections such as farmers, salaried class and labourers were being “demonetised”, a few “industrialist friends of Modi” were being monetised.

01-09-2021||New Delhi||Covid: Cases of depression, social media addiction on the rise among youth, say docs||Cases of anxiety, depression and social media addiction have been on the rise among the youth during the Covid pandemic, a private hospital said on Wednesday.Doctors at Apollo Hospital said curbs on outdoor activity since the outbreak of the pandemic have led to issues of irritability, erratic sleep, appetite problems and weight gain becoming more common among youths.“The number of OPD consultations for young adults have doubled for anxiety, depression, gaming and social media addiction and inability to concentrate and focus on studies,” said Dr Sandeep Vohra, senior consultant, mental health and psychiatry.Therefore, he said, parents are advised to actively engage with their children, talk to them and observe all kind of behavioural changes shown by them.Doctors compared average number of such cases in 2021 with the corresponding figures in 2019 to reach their conclusion, a spokesperson of the hospital said.With remote learning being the only solution for continuation of studies during the pandemic, the use of internet has increased manifold, their study said.Further, due to lack of physical activities, various behavioural changes have been observed among school and college-going students.All these factors are contributing to the cultivating of a sedentary lifestyle among young adults, and a feeling of agitation and helplessness among them, it said.Doctors highlighted the role of certain hormones—endorphins, serotonin, dopamine—released during physical activity, in keeping one happy and even-keeled.They stressed that mental health issues of young adults must be addressed by parents and teachers at the earliest.If the issues persist still, they should seek professional help, the doctors advised, according to the statement.Adolescence is an evolving stage of life, any disturbance in terms of both physical and mental health at this stage can hamper the future experiences in life, they said.

01-09-2021||New Delhi||‘As-salamu alaykum’ shows Sharjeel Imam’s speech was for particular community, police tells court||Delhi Police Wednesday said JNU student Sharjeel Imam began one of his alleged inflammatory speeches with ‘As-salamu alaykum’ salutation which shows it was addressed to a particular community and not the public at large.Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad, representing the police, made the remarks during the argument in a sedition case filed against Imam for speeches made by him at two universities in 2019, where he allegedly threatened to “cut off” Assam and the rest of the Northeast from India.During the hearing, Prasad apprised Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat that Imam attempted to create complete anarchy and gave divisive speeches during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).The SPP read out a January 16 speech given by the JNU student in Aligarh and said, “He [Sharjeel Imam] begins this speech by saying ‘As-salamu alaykum’, which shows that it is only subjected to one community”.“The people called upon to take action were also from one community. The speech was definitely divisive. It was not made for the general public at large but a specific community. He is attempting to create complete anarchy,” Prasad added.The alleged inflammatory speeches were made by Imam at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13, 2019, and at Aligarh Muslim University on December 16, 2019. He is in judicial custody since January 2020.In the three-hour-long hearing, Prasad emphasised that Imam is not a simple pickpocket or small-time drug peddler but a man with excellent oratory skills, who has written a thesis on rioting and has knowledge of how a critical mass can come together.Furthermore, the purported speeches made by Imam during the protests were read out by the prosecutor line-by-line during the virtual hearing.One portion of the speech as read by the SPP stated, “It is our responsibility to cut off Assam. They [the government] will listen to us only when Assam is cut off from the rest of the country. You are aware of the condition of Muslims in Assam.”Imam is accused of offenses relating to sedition, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, imputations prejudicial to national integration, and public mischief under the Indian Penal Code, and indulging in unlawful activities under the UAPA.Delhi Police had filed a charge sheet against Imam in the case, in which it alleged that he allegedly gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt, and disaffection towards the Central Government and instigated the people which led to the violence in December 2019.“In the garb of CAA, he (Imam) exhorted people of a particular community to block highways leading to major cities and resort to “chakka jaam”. Also, in the name of opposing CAA, he openly threatened to cut off Assam and other Northeastern states from the rest of the country,” the charge sheet said.

01-09-2021||New Delhi||Jallianwala Bagh complex restored with utmost respect: Culture Ministry||Amid allegations the government was “glamourising” the Jallianwala Bagh complex, the Culture Ministry Wednesday said it has been “restored” by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the agency that has restored World Heritage sites in the country, to conserve it for posterity.It also said a “poignant” soundtrack has been chosen as part of the sound and light show describing the event on the day of the massacre.Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently inaugurated four new galleries and opened the renovated memorial virtually, a year-and-a-half after it was closed for the revamp.The well into which the people jumped when forces led by Reginald Dyer opened fire on them has been covered with a transparent barrier. The narrow entrance has been adorned with sculptures. A daily sound and light show explaining the events has been started.Ministry of Culture Secretary Raghvendra Singh argued the complex was in dire need of conservation.“It has been restored by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) which is the agency that restored World Heritage sites in the country. Instead of letting a derelict structure to fall, we have restored it to conserve it for posterity,” he told PTI, but refused to comment on the political storm brewing over the restoration.On the criticism over the light and sound show, Singh said that the show existed but it became defunct over time.“The soundtrack is so poignant. It has been very sensitively done and is informative as well. Anyone coming to this place will leave better informed. The galleries too have been improved, technology has been improved to bring out the poignancy of the killings of innocents and how the incident influenced other bravehearts,” said Singh.He said the work has been done with “utmost respect”.Slamming the revamp, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said only a person who does not know the “meaning of martyrdom can inflict such an insult on the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh”.“I am the son of a martyr — I will not tolerate the insult of martyrs at any cost…We are against this indecent cruelty,” he had earlier this week.Some historians have also criticised the work terming it an “insult towards the martyrs”.“This is corporatisation of monuments, where they end up as modern structures, losing the heritage value. Look after them without meddling with the flavours of the period these memorials represent,” tweeted historian S Irfan Habib.Officials, however, say that these allegations are “untrue”. They said the accusation that the bullet marks have even “hidden” was false. The bullet marks have been conserved, they said.They said the earlier structure was “filthy” with defunct fountains which have now been restored, cleaned and a lily pond installed. The entire area has been landscaped, officials said, making the place visually appealing.Officials involved in the process said the well was covered with rubbish, now it has been restored and even lit from inside.In terms of tourist footfall too, the restoration will bring rich dividends for the city, officials said.Near to the Golden Temple, the renovated complex is expected to draw in tourists with its moesha halls, laser show and galleries, the ministry hopes.The Golden Temple received a footfall of around one lakh per day during the week and 1.5 lakh during weekends and special day before the coronavirus crisis forced its closure.Over 1,000 people were killed and hundreds wounded on April 13, 1919 when British troops fired indiscriminately on an unarmed gathering of thousands who had assembled in Jallianwala Bagh in Punjab amid nationwide protests against the Rowlatt Act which had extended wartime repressive measures.

01-09-2021||New Delhi||India’s sugar export to Afghanistan almost at halt; should resume after normalcy restored||India’s sugar export to Afghanistan has almost come to a halt with Indian merchants reporting cancellation of orders in the wake of the current situation there, a senior government official said on Wednesday.The Taliban ousted the government in Afghanistan and took over the control of the country after capturing Kabul last month.Afghanistan is one of the top three destinations for Indian sugar exports. About 6,00,000-7,00,000 tonne of the sweetener is exported annually.     About 6,50,000 tonne of sugar has already been exported so far in the current 2020-21 season ending this month, as per the trade data. Sugar season runs from October to September.     “Our sugar export to Afghanistan has been affected now because of the prevailing current situation out there. Some orders have been cancelled,” Joint Secretary in the Food Ministry Subodh Kumar Singh told PTI.However, sugar exports to Afghanistan should resume in the next season after the normalcy is restored under the new regime, he said.Taliban fighters, who were removed from power in Afghanistan by US-led forces in 2001, have resurfaced again, taking control of most of the parts of Afghanistan, after the government there collapsed and embattled president Ashraf Ghani fled the country, much like his fellow citizens.Currently, there is no change in the India-Afghanistan trade policy unlike Pakistan which has decided not to buy sugar from India.             India, the world’s second largest sugar producer after Brazil, has so far exported more than 6 million tonne of the sweetener in the 2020-21 season.     Sugar production in India is estimated at 31 million tonne in the current 2020-21 season.

It has been incubated at IIT Ropar, which is a designated iHub -- AWaDH (Agriculture and Water Technology Development Hub) by the Department of Science and Technology.The technology works through the air-purifying natural leafy plants including Peace Lily, Snake Plant and Spider plants. The room air interacts with leaves and goes to the soil-root zone where maximum pollutants are purified.The developers claimed that ‘Ubreathe Life’ improves indoor air quality by removing particulate, gaseous and biological contaminants while increasing the oxygen levels in the indoor space through specific plants, UV disinfection and a stack of pre-filter, charcoal filter and HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter fitted in a specially designed wooden box.There is a centrifugal fan that creates a suction pressure inside the purifier, and releases purified air, formed at the roots, through the outlet in a 360 degree direction.They said the indoor air spaces are five times more polluted than outdoor air space. That is a cause of concern especially in the present Covid pandemic times. A research, which has recently been published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), calls upon the governments to alter building designs by fixing air changes per hour (a measure of room ventilation with outdoor air). The ‘Ubreathe Life’ can be a solution to this concern, claimed the scientists.IIT Ropar director Prof Rajeev Ahuja claimed that the results of testing, conducted by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories and the Laboratory of IIT Ropar maintained that the AQI (Air Quality Index) for a room size of 150 sq ft dropped from 311 to 39 in 15 minutes after using ‘Ubreathe Life’.Sanjay Maurya, CEO, Ubreathe, said the consumer need not water the plant regularly as there is a built-in water reservoir with a capacity of 150ml which acts as a buffer for plant requirements. He says that the device supplies water to the roots whenever it gets too dry.Prof Ahuja assured that IIT is capable of producing the product in large quantity to market it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iit-ropar-develops-plant-based-air-purifier-machine-305084

The first is that the issue has been ‘resolved’ or settled to India’s satisfaction. That is not what happened at the UNSC. The second meaning is that we have put our wishes on paper and got some others to sign that paper! That is what happened at UNSC yesterday,” the former Union minister said on Twitter.It is too premature to congratulate ourselves, Chidambaram said.The possible axis of China, Pakistan and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan is a cause for worry, he cautioned.The Security Council on Monday adopted the resolution sponsored by France, UK and the US with 13 members voting in favour, none against and permanent, veto-wielding members Russia and China abstaining.This was the first resolution adopted by the powerful 15-nation Council on the situation in Afghanistan following the takeover of Kabul by the Taliban and came on the penultimate day of India’s Presidency of the Security Council for the month of August.

01-09-2021||Vibha Sharma||Country likely to receive above-normal rains in September||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 1After deficient rains in August, monsoon rains are expected to be “above normal” in September. However, many areas of Northwest and Northeast India are expected to get below normal rains in the last month of the June-September season, IMD DG Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said on Wednesday.Rains are expected to continue for today over Northwest, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and Western UP, and decrease thereafter. Peninsular India and parts of East, like Bihar, are expected to get above normal rain. It is expected that the June-September rains will end in the lower end of normal and the current deficiency of 9 per cent would reduce, Mohapatra said.Regarding the message to farmers due to the deficiency and expected crop damage in some parts, Mohapatra said the IMD would “regularly update the forecast”.  While giving reasons for deficient rains in August like cloudiness being suppressed and the Bay of Bengal not getting remnant of typhoons from the eastern sides, Mohapatra admitted that the IMD was not able to predict deficient rains during August in several parts, including Gujarat and Odisha, currently the most affected parts of the country.   Currently, neutral ENSO conditions are prevailing; however, there is an increased possibility of La Nina emerging towards the end of September /beginning of October.Suffering from uneven monsoon rains in August, while eastern parts of India like Bihar and Assam struggled with floods and swelling rivers, plains of the Northwest, including Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, registered a deficiency ranging between 32 and 56 per cent this month, despite heavy rains on the last day of August.   Across eastern India, hundreds of thousands of people have suffered due to incessant rains. Flood waters have submerged nearly 70 per cent of the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) in Assam, forcing wild animals to move to higher grounds. Incessant downpours have also resulted in Brahmaputra and other rivers bursting their banks in Assam and Bihar.On the other side, deficient rains in Northwest and Central India have sent worrying signals to farmers in the middle of the paddy season. Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Maharashtra, Telangana, Goa and Karnataka in Central and Peninsular India; and Nagaland and Manipur in the Northeast have all received deficient rains.The IMD has forecast enhancement of rainfall activity over South Central and Peninsular India. Mohapatra said, “The rainfall averaged over the country as a whole during September is most likely to be above normal (>110 per cent of long period average (LPA)). The LPA of rainfall during September based on the data of 1961-2010 is about 170 mm. Considering the expected above-normal rainfall activity during September, the current deficiency of 9 per cent in seasonal rainfall during June to August is very likely to reduce and accumulated seasonal rainfall from June 1 to September 30 is very likely to be around lower end of the normal."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/country-likely-to-receive-above-normal-rains-in-september-305040

01-09-2021||New Delhi||Air pollution in India could cut life expectancy by 9 years: Study||India's air pollution levels have expanded geographically over time and increased so much in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh that an average person is now losing an additional 2.5 to 2.9 years of life expectancy, according to a new report.India is the most polluted country in the world, with more than 480 million people or about 40 per cent of its population living in the Indo-Gangetic plains in the north where pollution levels regularly exceed those found anywhere else in the world by an order of magnitude, stated the University of Chicago's Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) report.The study by the varsity's Energy Policy Institute ascertains how much longer a person can live if they breathe clean air.Residents of northern India are on track to lose more than nine years of life expectancy if pollution levels of that of 2019 persist as the region experiences the most extreme levels of air pollution in the world, it said.In 2019, India's average particulate matter concentration was 70.3 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3), the highest in the world and seven times the World Health Organisation's guideline of 10 µg/m3, the report said.It said that alarmingly India's high levels of air pollution have expanded geographically over time."Compared to a couple of decades ago, particulate pollution is no longer a feature of the Indo-Gangetic plains alone. Pollution has increased so much in the states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. For example, the average person in those states is now losing an additional 2.5 to 2.9 years of life expectancy, relative to early 2000," the report said.For Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan, the AQLI data reveals that the average person would live 5.6 years longer if pollution were reduced to meet the WHO guidelines, it said."Due to South Asia's high population and pollution concentrations, the region accounts for 58 per cent of total life years lost due to particulate pollution exceeding the WHO guideline," it said.The benefits of clean air policy are even greater in the Indo-Gangetic plains, where 480 million people regularly breathe pollution levels that exceed those found in Europe and North America by an order of magnitude, the report said.Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan account for nearly a quarter of the global population and consistently rank among the top five most polluted countries in the world, it said.As a result, South Asia accounts for 60 per cent of the person-years that are expected to be lost globally due to pollution levels exceeding the WHO guideline, the University of Chicago's report said."Average life expectancy across these four countries would be 5.6 years higher if pollution concentrations complied with the WHO guideline," it said.In India and Pakistan, the number of vehicles on the road has increased about four-fold since the early 2000s while in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan combined, electricity generation from fossil fuels tripled from 1998 to 2017, the report said.Crop burning, brick kilns, and other industrial activities have also contributed to rising particulates in the region, it said.The AQLI, the report said, particulate pollution is the world's greatest threat to human health."South Asia is consistently the most polluted region, with the people there seeing their lives shortened by an average of 5 years relative to what it would be if the region met the WHO guideline—and even more in the most polluted parts of the region like northern India," the report said.

It later grew by 1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter (January to March), the first sign of an incipient pickup after the lockdown impact started receding.Some of the factors that provided the boost were exports, which rose by 8.7 per cent, imports that fell by 5.3 per cent, and construction and manufacturing sectors, which rose 68.3 per cent and 49.6 per cent. Gross Value Added (GVA) in the economy during April-June rose 18.8 per cent at Rs. 32.38 lakh crore. In statistical terms, this puts India on track to record the highest growth rate in a full fiscal year provided there is no pandemic-induced disruption.However, these numbers should not be confused with a strong recovery because of the low base effect. Last year, the complete shutdown during May-June had seen GVA plummeting to Rs 26.95 lakh crore. This year’s first quarter figures of Rs 32.238 lakh crore are still lower than the pre-pandemic GVA of Rs 35.66 lakh crore in the first quarter of 2019, indicating that the economy still has to recover fully.Low base effect propels growth||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gdp-grows-20-1-yet-to-recover-fully-304720

But the crowds milling outside Kabul airport and at the borders with Pakistan suggested otherwise. There were also reports of reprisals by the Taliban in some regions.“This is not a tactic but our strategy and approach,” underlined Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. He also said the new regime wanted good political and economic relations with the world.A similar assurance was given by the head of the Taliban’s Political Office in Doha, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, to Indian ambassador to Qatar Deepak Mittal after a meeting requested by the insurgent organisation. Stanikzai had recently extended the olive branch to India by stating that the Taliban wanted to have good political and economic ties with India. For New Delhi, it was the first formal meeting with the Taliban, which has been meeting envoys of half-dozen countries daily.Mittal along with diplomat JP Singh have attended some of the Doha confabulations and are also understood to have met Taliban leaders, including Stanikzai, an alumnus of the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun.Faced with the embarrassment of only Russia, China and a handful of other countries maintaining their missions in Kabul, the Taliban are looking at India and other neighbours to reopen their embassies. Another Taliban leader Maulvi Delawar welcomed the countries that have kept open their embassies and called on those who have left to reopen their embassies.A third Taliban leader said while security problems have been solved, there are economic problems.
