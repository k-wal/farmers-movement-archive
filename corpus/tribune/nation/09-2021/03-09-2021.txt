We have also seized computers and other material from the accused. We are investigating the complaint. The accused editor is being questioned,” the officer said.A case was registered under various IPC sections, including 292-2 (obscene and indecent publication), 354-A (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 506 (criminal intimidation), 385 (putting person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy), he said.“The false and obscene portrayal of me on social media and web portal have tarnished my image which ultimately impacted my performance in the Olympics. I do not know what harm I have done to these people,” Chand, who too recorded her statement with the police, said.The ace sprinter has also accused Pradip Pradhan, an RTI activist, of mental harassment and criminal intimidation.“Pradhan will also be questioned as his name also figured in the FIR,” the police officer said.Rout and Pradhan could not immediately be reached for comments.The name of another journalist of the channel was also included in the FIR.In her complaint, Chand alleged that a senior journalist of the channel demanded money from her for not airing an interview in which her family members reportedly spoke about their personal issues with her.Chand also moved court over the matter and filed a defamation case, making eight persons and organisations as parties, including the web portal editor, Facebook and Google.The court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) Bhubaneswar restrained the portal and the editor from circulating defamatory news against her.The next date of hearing is on September 15.The incident came close on the heels of the Supreme Court expressing concern over web portals and YouTube channels.On August 27, a woman journalist of a web portal and four others were arrested by Nandankanan police station on charge of kidnapping and extortion.In Malkangiri district, five persons, including a local journalist, were arrested on July 15 on the charge of extortion of Rs 8 lakh from a government official.

03-09-2021||New Delhi||Delhi riots charge sheet reads like web series, says Umar Khalid; refers to Harry Potter villain||Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, arrested under the stringent anti-terror law UAPA in the north-east Delhi riots conspiracy case, told the court on Friday that the charge sheet against him reads like a web-series or TV news script and referred to Harry Potter villain Voldemort while attacking it.Khalid and several other are accused of being the “masterminds” of the February 2020 riots which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.He has sought bail in the case.Senior Advocate Trideep Pais, representing Khalid, told Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat that the charge sheet makes hyperbolic allegations against his client without any factual basis and is a result of the fertile imagination of the police officer who drafted it.The lawyer also gave reference of Voldemort, a villain in Harry Potter series of books/movies, to draw parallels between the statements in the charge sheet, among other examples to show that the final report filed by the police was “rubbish”.Pais argued, “The charge sheet is a result of the fertile imagination of the police officer who drafted it and the witnesses are procured... He is not writing the script of Family Man [a web-series]. This is a charge sheet.” Referring to a line in the charge sheet which stated that Umar kept a safe distance from Delhi as he knew that it would be thrown into the fire, he said that the only way the police officer could have known this was if “he was inside Khalid’s mind”.“The last person who travelled with someone and got into this officer’s head was Voldemort from Harry Potter,” the lawyer said.The counsel further called the allegation that Umar was maintaining a “facade of secular politics” a figment of the police imagination, and said that it “reads like a 9 pm TV news channel script.”Pais said that several statements carried in the chargesheet cannot be relied upon while considering his bail. “There is no way these statements are consistent with each other and meet the test under UAPA,” he added.He further said that there was nothing in Umar’s speeches that led to lawless action, sedition, hatred, or any illegality of any sort.In the last hearing, Pais had argued that the police’s case was based on truncated clips of Khalid’s speech given at Amaravati telecasted by two TV channels, which were in turn based on an edited video tweeted by BJP leader Amit Malviya.The matter will be heard again on September 6, 2021.Delhi Police had recently said that the bail plea has no merit and that it will demonstrate the prima facie case against him before the court by referring to the chargesheet filed in the case.

We have already extended the time once. By the time you frame the guidelines, the third phase will also be over,” a Bench led by Justice MR Shah told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta who said everything is under consideration.Petitioner advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal pointed out that the court has already granted four-week extension to the Centre on August 16 to frame guidelines for ex-gratia compensation and now it is seeking more time.The first direction in this regard was passed on June 30 and the extended time was scheduled to end on September 8.On the issue of compensation, the court said it’s for the Centre to take a decision within this period as it adjourned the hearing to September 13 for compliance of other directions.The top court had on June 30 directed the National Disaster Management Authority to recommend within six weeks appropriate guidelines for ex-gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of persons who died due to Covid-19.It had also ordered steps to simplify guidelines for issuance and correction of death certificates/official documents, stating the exact cause of death, that is, ‘Death due to Covid-19’ for enabling dependents to get benefits of welfare schemes.Earlier, the Centre had sought more time to frame the guidelines on the ground that the exercise which was in active consideration of the NDMA was at an advanced stage and required an in-depth examination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-sc-asks-govt-to-frame-guidelines-on-death-certificates-by-sept-11-306019

03-09-2021||Chandigarh||Dust and clouds impact solar power generation leading to financial loss, finds study||A team of Indian and Greek researchers have found that aerosols, dust and clouds reduce solar energy generation from photovoltaic and rooftop solar installations, resulting in substantial economic impact.They have estimated that the impact of total aerosol optical depth on photovoltaic (PV) and rooftop installations amount to annual financial loss of up to Rs 15.5 lakh and the corresponding financial loss due to clouds and dust is Rs 24.7 lakh and Rs 5.6 lakh, respectively for a one megawatt power generation system.The country has an installed solar power generation capacity of about 40 giga watts and is among the top five countries in the world in this regard. This estimation can help the Indian solar energy producers and the electricity handling entities for efficient transmission and distribution system operations and grid stability optimisation.Recently, solar energy generation has been widely used in developing countries such as India, which has sufficient solar resources.However, clouds and aerosols limit the solar irradiance causing performance issues in the PV installations and concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. To achieve the large-scale development of a solar system requires proper planning and there is a need to estimate the solar potential.Researchers at the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital, and National Observatory of Athens (NOA), Greece, studied the impact of aerosols and clouds on the solar energy potential over a high-altitude remote location in the central Himalayan region.The study, published in the journal, Remote Sensing, shows that dust and cloud cover increased the attenuation of radiation, leading to lower energy production levels. It was much stronger for clouds than for aerosols and dust. The scientists calculated the annual financial loss due to this loss in energy.The research provides a comprehensive investigation of the impact of aerosols and clouds on solar energy production over the region, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology today. Furthermore, this study attempts a financial loss analysis by simulating a hypothetical scenario of a PV and CSP system with nominal power of 1 MW assumed to be installed in the central Himalayan region.The scientists are now planning to connect the solar energy production levels and distribution with the consumption at selected local administrative units across India and quantify the aerosol and cloud effects into the solar forecasting and energy trading principles for a decentralised energy ecosystem.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dust-and-clouds-impact-solar-power-generation-leading-to-financial-loss-finds-study-306003

The trial for this jailbreak attempt is still pending. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trial-in-ahmedabad-serial-blast-case-concludes-after-13-years-court-reserves-verdict-305992

03-09-2021||Vibha Sharma||Increase in rainfall activity over parts of northwest, including Haryana and Himachal, around September 6, 7: IMD||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 3There will be an increase in the rainfall activity over parts of northwest India, including Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, around September 6 and 7, the IMD said on Friday.The weather office said scattered to fairly widespread rainfall activity (along with isolated heavy falls over Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, northwest Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh) in the region on Friday will decrease from Saturday.However, it will pick up again with scattered to fairly widespread rainfall from September 6 onwards over certain parts of northwest.The IMD said isolated heavy falls are likely over Himachal Pradesh on September 7, west Uttar Pradesh, east Rajasthan on September 6 and 7; Uttarakhand between September 4 and 7, Haryana on September 7, and east Uttar Pradesh on September 6.After deficient rains in August, while monsoon rains are expected to be “above normal” in September, many areas of northwest and northeast are likely to get below-normal rains in the last leg of the June-September season, the IMD said on September 1.The September rains will help reduce the current deficiency of 9 per cent. However, it is expected that the accumulated rains for the season will be around the lower end of normal in the season, according to the weather office.An unpredictable pace and spatial distribution has made the 2021 season a tough one for meteorologists to crack and difficult for farmers to plan their agriculture activities. As many as 11 of 36 meteorological divisions, including in northwest, have registered deficient rains ranging up to 52 per cent and more in the first three months of the June-September season.Deficient rains in northwest and central parts have sent worrying signals to farmers in the middle of the paddy season.  Almost two-thirds of India's farmlands depend on monsoon and there are fears of crop damage in some parts that are not irrigated.The IMD has forecast enhancement of rainfall activity over south, central and peninsular India.Enhanced activity with fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls is likely over peninsular India and east coast from September 5 and 7 and over Telangana and coastal Andhra Pradesh where rainfall activity is likely to continue during the next five days. Rainfall activity over central and east India is also likely to increase from September 5 with fairly widespread rainfall activity and isolated heavy falls over Odisha during September 4 and 7, it said. Currently, the western end of monsoon trough lies south of its normal position and its eastern end north of its normal position. The western end is likely to shift gradually northwards till September 6, leading to increase in rains in north.The monsoon trough is likely to shift with the likely formation of a low pressure area over north and adjoining central Bay of Bengal around September 6, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/increase-in-rainfall-activity-over-parts-of-northwest-including-haryana-and-himachal-around-september-6-7-imd-305987

No sooner did the train chug off that I felt the need to urgently move my bowels. So I ripped off my kurta and pyjama and made a dash to the toilet.""On the way, I was accosted by this self-righteous man. I shoved him away and after relieving myself I confronted him. I admonished him saying he should have looked at my age. I am 60. He spoke of women passengers feeling uncomfortable though no woman or girl was inside the compartment," the MLA said.The legislator claimed that he suspected that the co-passenger was "drunk", which has not been confirmed by railway and police sources here. Sale and consumption of alcohol is banned in Bihar."The man finally realised his mistake when he learnt that I was an MLA. I also pointed out to him that I was wearing knee-length shorts and not briefs, which could leave people scandalised," said Mandal, who is now in Delhi.Back home, baiters of the JD(U) were quick to blame his conduct for "bringing a bad name to Bihar".LJP MP Chirag Paswan said, "I am not aware of the full episode. But I must say that incidents like these are responsible for Bihar's poor reputation. I wish the chief minister, who is now left with just a handful of MLAs, could spend some time tutoring the public representatives on public conduct."RJD MLA Bhai Virendra said, “The so-called ‘sushasan babu’ should take note of such foul behaviour.

Our preliminary probe has shown that the changes in syllabi followed an exercise towards the implementation of the new National Education Policy. The changes were recommended by a panel set up by the office of the University Chancellor. The chancellor sent across these recommendations to all varsities and possibly many more universities may have effected changes in syllabi although we can’t understand the connection between syllabus change and Credit Based Choice System under the NEP which was sought to be implemented. So we have told the higher education department to contact all universities and find out if more institutions effected changes like Jayaprakash University did,” Chaudhary said.Bihar governor and former BJP leader Phagu Chauhan is the Chancellor of Jayaprakash University which has removed the  philosophy of JP and Lohia from MA political science paper on Indian political thought and added the thoughts of leaders including Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay, a BJP and RSS ideologue.Chaudhary said dropping the thoughts of socialist leaders from political science syllabus was like purging the syllabus of Indian-ness itself.Bihar government said although universities were autonomous and came under the Chancellor, they were accountable to the state government for major policy shifts in education content because the state bore their financial responsibilities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jp-lohia-purge-from-ma-syllabus-of-jai-prakash-varsity-bihar-govt-orders-probe-305965
03-09-2021||New Delhi||'Pilots are better leaders with vision', Rahul says his father had warned Sanjay Gandhi||Rahul Gandhi in a video released on social media has said that pilots are better leaders with vision and that his late father Rajiv Gandhi had warned his uncle (Sanjay Gandhi) about the dangers of flying.Rahul said this during an interaction with the Youth Congress leaders in a photo exhibition on late prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, the video of which was released on YouTube on Thursday.Sanjay Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi's younger brother, had died in an air crash on June 23, 1980 near the Safdarjung Airport in New Delhi. He was flying a new aircraft of the Delhi Flying Club, and, while performing an aerobatic manoeuvre lost control and crashed.In the video, Rahul said, "'Look, if you're a pilot. That's a risk you take. You take it. So, my father told my uncle. Because my uncle was flying a particular type of plane - it was a Pitts. It's a very aggressive plane. My father told him that you know, don't do this. My uncle really didn't have the experience. My uncle had similar hours to what I have - about 300-350."He said pilots are better leaders as they have a very particular ability that comes from their training and it is this idea, that you have to move, from a 30,000 foot vision to details in the cockpit."So a pilot, and I am one, we move from these 2 spaces very seamlessly and very quickly. Pilots also when they fly, their imagination isn't blocked by roads, by railway lines. Their imagination is at 30,000 feet, so they have this ability to see large systems. If they lose track of details in the cockpit you run into trouble. And if they lose track of the 30,000 foot picture, you run into trouble."Rahul said his father was a pilot and this really helped him."I could see this process taking place where he would go and meet people, get into their details, understand their details and then instantly move to 30,000-40,000-50,000 feet and look at the big picture. His work was constantly moving between these two perspectives and always understanding that imagination can bridge anything. So that to me was a very powerful thing that my father had."He also recalled that DC 3 was both his father's and his favourite plane. "That's the most beautiful plane and it's the first plane my father flew commercial on."He said his father used to wake him up early for early flights, "I remember once he came into my room at about 3.30 in the morning. He's like, 'okay, get ready'. So I was like, 'What is this, get ready?' So he didn't tell me why or anything like  that. So I was like 'okay'. I had a little aluminium case, this big (indicates), I packed it with shirts and my pants and my shoes and then I remember walking out in the dark and going."In the video, a question is asked to Rahul - "How did your mother react to your father flying?. Rahul replies, "Yeah, my mother was worried, so every time my father would go on a flight, you know it would be, my mother would have this record playing in the background that he's on a flight. It's so dangerous and she'd be worried and she'd be transferring that worry. Then once there was some problem in Kashmir and then there was some issue with his aircraft. So my mother I remember getting really worked up." IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pilots-are-better-leaders-with-vision-rahul-says-his-father-had-warned-sanjay-gandhi-305963

03-09-2021||Rohit Bhan||From Mard-e-Momin to Hartal uncle, an asset Pakistan never wanted to lose||In the heart of Kashmir’s summer capital in 2008, a 79-year-old cheered on by a delirious crowd declared: “Secularism nahi chalega, nationalism nahi chalega, subaiyat nahi chalega... Yahan sirf aur sirf Islam chalega... Islam ki nisbat se hum Pakistani hain aur Pakistan hamara hai. (Secularism won’t work here, nationalism won’t work here, provincialism won’t work here. The only thing that will work is Islam. Because of the relationship of Islam, we are Pakistani and Pakistan is ours).”Also read: Quiet burial for Geelani in Srinagar amid securityPakistani flag to fly at half mast to mourn Geelani's deathAs he egged on thousands to chant Inshallah, Inshallah, Syed Ali Shah Geelani made his “unwavering” commitment to the Pakistan’s cause in a state deadlocked in decades of bloodshed. Now, with the fountainhead of the Hurriyat laid to rest in Srinagar at age 92, the most strident secessionist voice of Kashmir during its three-decade-long militancy has been stilled.Geelani was in electoral politics for almost 30 years. He contested elections eight times — five for the state Assembly and thrice for Parliament. He won Assembly elections from Sopore in 1972, 1977 and 1987.He was the head of the political wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami. His rise as a prominent separatist leader, beginning in the early 1990s, coincided with a surge in militancy. Geelani tried to distance himself from terror groups, but the links of outfits such as Hizbul Mujahideen with the Jamaat were too stark to be ignored.When the Hurriyat Conference was formed in 1993, he was the sole representative of the Jamaat. Following differences with other leaders, he split Hurriyat in 2003.From 1993 to 2019, Kashmir saw the worst in terms of militancy and witnessed what came to be known as Kashmir’s “intifada”. At the call of Hurriyat leaders, young stone-pelters hit the streets, targeting security forces. In the subsequent clashes, many young lives were lost. Geelani was bestowed with the sobriquet of “Mard-e-Momin” (Man of God) by many impressionable young people.And while his rise as a seemingly unchallenged separatist leader continued, he drew criticism for encouraging and glorifying militants. The creation of terrorists like Burhan Wani was seen as fallout of his preaching.The Indian intelligence set-up was also accused of soft-peddling on him even as he freely travelled to Delhi and held events for the Kashmir’s “cause”. Many saw it as an attempt to win him over, but he remained a staunch Pakistani asset till the end. The scrapping of Article 370 and failing health left Geelani seemingly inconsequential towards the end, but he managed to cement his place in Kashmir’s chequered history.Stood his groundSaddened by the news of Geelani sahib’s passing away. We may not have agreed on most things, but I respect him for his steadfastness and for not wavering from his beliefs. May Allah grant him jannat. — Mehbooba Mufti, Former Chief MinisterBacked pak’s causeNo doubt, Geelani was the tallest among the separatist leaders, but Pakistan had backed a ‘wrong hawk’. He was the last man standing in the Valley to back Pakistan’s cause. — AS Dulat, Former Chief, RAWAlways in actionGeelani was in the thick and thin of ever-changing situation in Jammu and Kashmir. His views on Kashmir’s accession to Pakistan remained a single-point agenda during his political activism. — Ashok Prasad, Former DG, J&k PoliceDeep condolencesHeartfelt condolences to the family of Syed Ali Shah Geelani sahib. He was an esteemed colleague of my late father.

Rajnath Singh, Defence MinisterAddressing Gujarat BJP leaders on the second day of the party’s three-day state executive meeting at Kevadia in Narmada district, he slammed the Congress, saying the party was not sensitive enough towards the Army jawans as it had kept the issue of ‘one rank, one pension (OROP)’ pendng for 40 years.“We have not let terrorists succeed in their designs. That is why other than Jammu and Kashmir and some nearby areas, there has been no major terrorist incident in the country in the past seven years,” Rajnath said. “Terrorists now realise that they are not secure even in their safe havens.

PTI“Everything shown in a section of private news channels bears a communal tone. Ultimately, the country is going to get a bad name. Did you ever attempt to regulate these private channels?” a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana asked the Centre. “Twitter, Facebook or YouTube—they never respond to us and there’s no accountability. About the institutions they have written badly and they don’t respond… and say this is their right. They only worry about powerful men and not judges, institutions or common man. That is what we have seen,” the CJI said during hearing on petitions filed by Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind and others. The petitioners have sought directions to the Centre to stop fake news on Tablighi Jamaat’s March 2020 congregation at Markaz Nizamuddin and act against those involved.“There is no control over fake news and slandering via web portals and YouTube channels. If you go to YouTube, you will find how fake news is freely circulated and anyone can start a channel on YouTube,” the Bench noted. Agreeing with the Bench, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said, “Not only communal, but also planted news.” The new IT rules made social media intermediaries more accountable, he claimed.Senior counsel Sanjay Hegde, representing a petitioner, said Twitter “de-platformed” him and he had to file a case challenging the suspension of his account.The Bench posted it for hearing after six weeks when it would take up the Centre’s plea for transfer of petitions from various high courts to itself on the issue of newly enacted IT rules meant to regulate online content, including social media and web portals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fake-communal-news-on-social-media-portals-may-bring-bad-name-to-india-sc-305646

Let’s treat Doha meeting for what it is... It is just a meeting.

There are 6 lakh Afghans of Baloch ethnicity. However, the Taliban is yet to formally meet Afghan Sikh and Hindu leaders.Resistance-2 said Wahed Khan became its first martyr in Shotul, one of the eight districts in Panjshir Valley. It was an indirect admission of Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid’s statement that fighters had entered Panjshir. Days after the talks with Taliban in Doha, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) today said: “Our main concern is that Afghan soil shouldn’t be used for terrorism or anti-Indian activities. This is our focus. Let’s see further what our roadmap will be. Let’s treat Doha meeting for what it is. It is just a meeting.

The Taliban had announced “preparations around the four sides of Panjshir Valley” on Wednesday after the failure of talks with Resistance-2, which they describe as a “local armed group”. But Afghan Vice-President Amrullah Saleh claims Panjshir Resistance is for the “whole country”.Tajikistan’s President Rahmon sent signals of solidarity to Resistance leaders on Thursday by awarding former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani and former Defence Minister Ahmad Shah Massoud with the country’s highest distinction.Both Rabbani and Massoud were Afghan Tajiks and implacably opposed to the Taliban’s version of Islam. They were also assassinated, Rabbani by a Taliban suicide bomber and Massoud in an Al-Qaida hit on behalf of the Taliban.

He, along with CBI Sub-inspector Abhishek Tiwari, were produced before a competent court and sent to two days’ police remand.Tiwari was taken into custody on late Wednesday night for allegedly receiving bribe from Daga.Both arrested persons have been named in the CBI FIR.“The CBI has booked, among others, its Sub-inspector and a Nagpur-based advocate on allegations, including illegal gratification. During the investigation, the CBI has arrested the Sub-inspector. The advocate is being questioned. Searches were conducted in Allahabad and Delhi,” said CBI spokesperson RC Joshi.A report of the PE purportedly giving clean chit to Deshmukh was leaked on Saturday night, causing embarrassment to the agency. The CBI started a probe into the leakage in which it emerged that findings of the PE were influenced.The attempt by the Deshmukh’s team to influence the investigation was an act of contempt of the Bombay High Court, which had directed that all concerned should cooperate with the CBI while conducting the PE, the officials said, adding that in this case, it had appeared that they tried to subvert the PE.Their attempt could not succeed as there was a procedure in the CBI, according to which evidence and legal opinion was also taken on record before the registration of an FIR, they said.The CBI had launched a PE on the orders of the Bombay HC, which had issued the direction while hearing a PIL on the allegations of corruption against Deshmukh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-arrests-anil-deshmukhs-lawyer-for-influencing-probe-305657

03-09-2021||New Delhi||Concerns relating to terrorism primary focus: India on Afghanistan||India on Thursday said its immediate focus relating to Afghanistan is to ensure that Afghan soil is not used for terrorist activities against it, two days after the Indian envoy to Qatar held talks with a top Taliban leader in Doha and conveyed similar concerns.To a volley of questions at a media briefing on whether India was ready to recognise a Taliban regime in the backdrop of the Doha meeting, spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Arindam Bagchi said it is too early to talk about it.“Let’s treat the Doha meeting for what it is. It was just a meeting. I think these are very early days,” he said.“We used the opportunity to convey our concerns whether it is in getting people out (from Afghanistan) or on the issue of terrorism. We received a positive response,” he said.Asked about India’s engagement with the Taliban and whether is it not a terrorist organisation, Bagchi said: “That’s not our focus. Our focus is that Afghan soil should not be used for terrorist activities of any kind.” On Tuesday, the MEA said Indian envoy to Qatar Deepak Mittal met Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, the head of the Taliban’s Political Office in Doha, at the request of the group.In the meeting, Mittal conveyed to Stanekzai that Afghanistan’s soil should not be used for anti-Indian activities and terrorism. It was the first publicly acknowledged formal diplomatic engagement that came two weeks after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan.When pressed further on whether India will have more meetings with the Taliban, Bagchi said he does not have any update to share and that he does want to speculate.Asked about the possible roadmap of engagement with the Taliban, the MEA spokesperson added: “It is not a yes or no question. We would not have done anything without thinking.” “Our primary immediate concern is that Afghan soil should not be used for anti-India activities and for terrorism against India. Our focus is this. Let’s see what happens,” he said.When asked about reports of the formation of an inclusive government in Kabul and whether India has been invited for the inauguration of the new dispensation, Bagchi said: “I have no update on either issue.” “I do not have any details that I can share with you regarding the nature of the government that could be formed in Afghanistan.”  There have been mounting concerns in India over the possibility of rise in activities of various terror groups, including Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.To a question on the Taliban not commenting on the Doha meeting, Bagchi said it is up to the outfit.When asked why there was no photo of the meeting or whether the Taliban did not want it, Bagchi said: “It was just a meeting.  It was not really that kind of an event where photos are taken. I do not think there is any thought behind it that we do not have a photo of it.”  On why the Taliban requested the Doha meeting, Bagchi said he presumed the group wanted to reach out to all the countries who have an interest and relevance to Afghanistan.On bringing back the remaining Indians from Afghanistan, he said India will be able to revisit the matter once the Kabul airport resumes operation.“We have been prioritising the evacuation of our nationals as well as some Afghans. Currently, the Kabul airport is not operational. I think we will be able to revisit the issue once the operations at Kabul airport resume,” Bagchi said.Asked about the number of Afghans who were issued e-visa since August 16, Bagchi said the database of it is with the Home Ministry as it handles the matter.To another query on whether India is working on a refugee policy for Afghans, the spokesperson said the matter comes under the Home Ministry.Bagchi said India always wanted peace and security in Afghanistan.

As Jood has already spent 4 months and 17 days in jail, he could become eligible for parole on 15 October. However, his expired visa clouds the prospects of his early release as it is likely that he will be sent to a detention centre awaiting deportation.In a plea bargaining process, Jood pleaded guilty to three main charges. These included assault’, ‘occasioning actual bodily harm in company of others’ and ‘armed with intention to commit indictable offence’. The other charges were dropped by the prosecution.Jood’s lawyer, Asri, told the court that the Haryana youth comes from a place where Hindus and Sikhs co-exist ‘in peace’ and argued that his action was spontaneous and out of fear. There was no evidence that it was motivated because of the victim’s Sikh faith, he pleaded.The magistrate noted that it was “one of the burdens of living in the society to not to succumb to provocation”.He said that the urge to pick up an object and strike someone, especially when they are down on the ground, must be resisted.

03-09-2021||New Delhi||Section of media gives communal colour to news bringing bad name to nation, says Supreme Court||A section of media gives communal colour to news bringing bad name to the country, the Supreme Court rued on Thursday, expressing serious concern over fake news on social media, including web portals and YouTube, which listen only to “the powerful voices” and not judges and institutions.The strong observations of the bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana came while hearing a batch of petitions, including the one filed by Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind, seeking directions to the Centre to stop dissemination of "fake news" related to last year's religious gathering at Nizamuddin Markaz and take strict action against those responsible for it.“The problem is, everything in this country is shown with a communal angle by a section of media. The country is going to get a bad name ultimately,” said the bench, adding, "Did you (the Centre) ever attempt to regulate these private channels?”The bench also agreed to hear after six weeks the Centre's plea seeking transfer of petitions to the apex court that are pending in high courts against the validity of new Information Technology Rules which aim to regulate online content.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said, "Not only communal but also planted news" is there and the IT Rules had been framed to regulate content online, including web portals.The social media listens only to “the powerful voices” and several things are written against judges, institutions without any accountability, said the bench, which also comprised Justices Surya Kant and AS Bopanna.Speaking for the bench, CJI Ramana said, “I have not come across where these social media, Twitter and Facebook, respond to common people. They never respond. There is no accountability. About the institutions, they have written badly and they do not respond and say that this is their right."They only worry about powerful men and not judges, institutions or common man. That is what we have seen. This is our experience.”    It further said: "There is no control over fake news and slandering in web portals and YouTube channels. If you go to YouTube, you will find how fake news is freely circulated and anyone can start a channel on YouTube."The top court permitted Jamiat to amend its petition and serve it within four weeks to the Centre through the Solicitor General who may file the response in two weeks thereafter.
