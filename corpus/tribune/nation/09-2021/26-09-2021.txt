It was not my intention,” she said, adding that posting videos on Instagram was the main source of earning for her family.Sahu said she has removed those videos from her Instagram account.In the two viral videos, the woman was seen dancing on two Bollywood songs - ‘Daye lage kabhi baye lage’ from the movie “Cocktail” and ‘Meri sham awadh se aayi hai’ from the movie “Welcome to Karachi” in front of the temple gate. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-woman-booked-after-videos-of-her-dance-outside-temple-go-viral-316521

The assailants were killed in police counter-fire.Video footage of the incident, which exposed security lapses in the system, showed policemen and lawyers rushing out in panic as gunshots rang out inside courtroom number 207.The joint commissioner of police (northern range) has been asked to probe the incident and submit a report while the case is being handled by the Crime Branch team.

26-09-2021||Amaravati||2 Andhra fishermen killed in Gulab storm, one missing||Two fishermen from Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh lost their lives in the cyclonic storm Gulab in Bay of Bengal on Sunday evening while another still remained missing.Three more fishermen reached the shore safely and called state Fisheries Minister S Appala Raju over phone from Akkupalli village and told him they were safe.Meanwhile, IMD has informed that the cyclone started making landfall and would cross the coast about 25 km north of Kalingapatnam as a cyclonic storm in the next three hours.Six fishermen from Palasa, who were returning to their native village by sea in a new boat they purchased in Odisha two days ago, were caught in the storm.One of the six called his village over phone and informed that their boat lost balance and five of his fellow fishermen were lost in the sea. Subsequently, his mobile phone too went silent, indicating that he too might have gone missing.However, three of them swam to safety while two others perished.The one who made the first phone call still remained untraced and his fellow fishermen fear he made still have been trapped in the ill-fated boat.The Fisheries Minister contacted the Navy authorities to carry out a rescue operation.The three north coastal districts of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam had been receiving moderate to heavy rain under the influence of Gulab.AP State Disaster Management Authority Commissioner K Kanna Babu said Gulab lay centered around 85 km from Kalingapatnam in Srikakulam district and likely to cross the coast between Kalingapatnam and Gopalpur (in Odisha) around midnight.He reviewed the situation with the district Collectors and other officials in Visakhapatnam and directed them to be on high alert.He said NDRF and SDRF teams have been positioned in the three north coastal districts for rescue and relief operations.In Srikakulam district, 182 persons from Vajrapukothuru mandal have been moved to relief camps, according to the Collector L Srikesh Balaji Rao.Meanwhile, the South Central Railway informed in a release that eight trains on the Vijayawada-Howrah route were diverted via Kharagpur, Jharsuguda, Bilaspur and Balharshah.Two other trains that were supposed to begin journey on Sunday, have been rescheduled for Monday.

26-09-2021||Mumbai/New Delhi||SpiceJet now introduces interim fixed pay system; some pilots flag continuing salary cuts||Budget carrier SpiceJet, which had resorted to hourly-basis pay for pilots amid the pandemic, on Sunday said it has introduced a new “interim fixed salary system” for captains and first officers.The airline said not only will pilot salaries “increase significantly” under the new pay structure but those who fly more than the stipulated minimum hours will be paid overtime.However, some pilots contested the assurance given by SpiceJet and claimed “stress” due to the continued reduction in their salaries implemented in April last year.The pilots claimed that they were being paid a third or a half of their pre-Covid-19 salaries despite the company achieving an occupancy rate of over 85 per cent on passenger flights and being among the largest air cargo carriers during the pandemic.The Gurgaon-headquartered airline said it had adopted a “block hour payment system” after the Covid-19 outbreak effective April 1, 2020, wherein pilots were paid based on the hourly flying rate without having to send anyone on ‘leave without pay’.“While many other airlines and organisations severed employee contracts during the pandemic, there was no retrenchment in SpiceJet,” a Spicejet spokesperson told PTI.“The migration to the block hour payment model was expected to be short-lived. However, the second wave of Covid-19 has delayed the implementation of our ‘normal’ salary structure,” the spokesperson said.An interim “fixed salary system” effective September 1, 2021, has now been implemented to provide better pay-out, said SpiceJet two days after it sent out an email to all pilots announcing the change.The objectives of the new system, it said, are having a pay structure that reflects fixed salary components and other relevant components.It will also enable payment of a fixed minimum salary to all available pilots and those who fly more than the stipulated minimum hours will be paid overtime, it added.“The company will be paying higher amount under the interim fixed salary system and this has been done keeping in mind the welfare of the greater pilot community,” SpiceJet said.Contesting the company’s claims on retrenchment, a SpiceJet insider said dozens of expat pilots, including captains, and some Indian pilots, who had put in their resignations, were sacked shortly after the pandemic outbreak.“The expats were sacked hurriedly while the Indian pilots were not even asked to reconsider their decision of resignation. This does not happen usually,” a pilot said on the condition of anonymity.Another senior pilot said, “Along with the hourly payments, we were promised a fixed monthly salary when the salaries were restructured in April last year. This fixed salary was very less for both what a captain and a first officer normally get.”    “However, we never got that fixed salary. Now, it’s a huge amount for many of us which is pending. The company also never mentions it in person or on emails. There is no word if we will even be getting that hard-earned money ever,” he said.He added that many are under stress due to this continued reduction of salary. “Some of my colleagues have left the company due to financial pressure, while some are trying hard to make ends meet.”        Responding to this claim, SpiceJet spokesperson said there are “no huge pending salary arrears”.All pending payments are kept as “outstanding payable” and are being paid in tranches, the spokesperson said.Multiple pilots from different regions that PTI spoke to denied having received any such arrear or part of it to date.They also claimed that the overtime allowances as per the new structure will also mean that those who fly more hours will end up getting lesser salaries than they got earlier in the hourly system.However, SpiceJet refuted this claim terming it as “practically impossible” and an attempt “to mislead and twist facts”.“As per the new structure, more than 90 per cent of the pilots will be getting a higher salary as compared to the existing block hour payment structure,” it added.It added that with the total number of flying hours gradually increasing, all pilots will be getting much more salary in the new structure.Another pilot, who is in his 30s, said, “If you talk to the company officials, they will always confuse you with technicalities and statistics. Just find out the condition of pilots and how they are managing EMIs, home expenses, etc.”    “We have lost our seniority (salary-structure on the basis of work experience),” he added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/spicejet-now-introduces-interim-fixed-pay-system-some-pilots-flag-continuing-salary-cuts-316512
26-09-2021||New Delhi||Nitish reiterates demand for caste census, says this is in national interest||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday reiterated his demand for a caste census, saying it is in national interest and will facilitate development of the communities lagging in development.Asked about the Centre’s affidavit in the Supreme Court that virtually ruled out census on the caste lines, he told reporters that it was “absolutely not correct” but added that the matter was not directly related to the issue of caste census.In the national capital to attend Home Minister Amit Shah’s meeting with the chief ministers of naxal-affected states, the JD(U) leader also rejected arguments against caste census and asserted that the demand for it has been coming from not only Bihar but many states.Kumar said he will speak to members of different parties in Bihar over the issue to chart out their next course of action.He had led an all-party delegation from the state to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in support of such a headcount across the country.However, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Thursday that caste census of backward classes is “administratively difficult and cumbersome” and excluding such information from the purview of Census is a “conscious policy decision”.In an affidavit filed in the apex court, the government has said that caste enumeration in Socio-Economic and Caste Census 2011 was fraught with mistakes and inaccuracies.Kumar asserted that caste census can be done by imparting appropriate training to people.However, the Bihar chief minister, whose party’s ties with the BJP have been uneven for some time, refused to be drawn into any political implications of the issue.“Caste census is in the interest of the country. It will help the country’s development,” he said.After the Centre’s stand, many BJP leaders in Bihar have strongly defended the move and questioned the need for caste census.The BJP has made it clear that its stand on the politically fraught issue can be different from those, including some of its allies, supporting the step.As far as the BJP is concerned, it stands for “sab ka saath, sabka vikas”, the party had said.

To address these challenges, we need not just more, but bigger banks.” The Union Minister said during keynote address at the 74th Annual General Meeting of the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) in Mumbai on Sunday.The Finance Minister exhorted the industry to visualise the shape Indian banking in the immediate and long-term future. “If we look at post-Covid scenario, India’s banking contour will have to be very unique, where there has been an extremely successful adoption of digitisation. While banks in many countries could not reach out to their clients during the pandemic, the level of digitisation of Indian banks helped us to transfer money to small, medium and big account holders through DBT and digital mechanisms.”The Union Minister underlined the importance of seamless and interconnected digital systems in creating a sustainable future for Indian banking industry. “Long-term future of Indian banking is going to be largely driven by digitised processes.”At the same time, the Finance Minister observed that there are wide disparities as well in access to financial services. “Almost two-thirds of nearly 7.5 lakh panchayats have optical fibre connection. IBA should consider this and conduct an exercise and decide where banks should have a physical presence and where we are able to serve customers even without physical branch. IBA should take the initiative and complement government’s efforts for financial inclusion and enhancing access to financial services, especially in unserved and under-served areas,” she suggested.The Minister appreciated banks for executing amalgamation of banks even during the pandemic, without causing disruption in services to customers. “I commend that you ensured that amalgamation did not inconvenience customers, you ensured that systems of different banks spoke to each other, you have kept yourselves available during the pandemic in serving customers, while also ensuring that banks’ amalgamation happened without friction, without aberrations,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/need-four-five-more-banks-like-state-bank-of-india-finance-minister-sitharaman-316489

26-09-2021||Beijing||India expresses disappointment over China's reluctance to permit stranded Indians return||India has expressed “disappointment” over China's reluctance to permit the return of thousands of stranded Indian students, employees, and their families due to the Covid-19 pandemic, describing it as an "unscientific approach" to a purely humanitarian issue.Over 23,000 Indian students, mostly studying medicine, and hundreds of Indian businessmen and workers along with their families have been stranded in India for over one year as China, where the pandemic was first reported in late 2019, has suspended the visa process as well as flights from India citing the Covid-19 situation.Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri referred to the woes of these stranded Indians at the 4th High-level Track-II Dialogue on China-India Relations held virtually on September 23.“Far less complex issues, which have a purely humanitarian context and are not connected to bilateral diplomatic stances, such as facilitating the movement of students, businesspersons and stranded family members from India to China for over a year and a half now, await a more balanced and sensitive approach," Misri said.The virtual dialogue was co-hosted by the School of International Studies of Sichuan University (SCU), China Centre for South Asian Studies, and Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).“I might add here that India has also attempted to keep our trade and commercial relationship insulated from current differences, for instance by continuing to issue visas to Chinese businesspersons to visit India," he said.“However, we are disappointed to see an unscientific approach with regard to several problems currently being faced by Indian students, businessmen, marine crew and exporters, to name a few," the ambassador said. Earlier this month, responding to questions on China lifting its travel restrictions on foreigners returning to the country, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Beijing stands ready to maintain close communication with all parties on issues related to international travel."The global Covid-19 situation remains grave and complicated. Referencing the practices of other countries, China adjusts its management measures on in-bound travellers accordingly as the epidemic situation evolves. "China stands ready to maintain close communication with all parties and properly manage the work related to international travel on the premise of ensuring effective epidemic control," the foreign ministry spokesperson said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-expresses-disappointment-over-chinas-reluctance-to-permit-stranded-indians-return-316481
26-09-2021||Lucknow||Mayawati extends support to bandh called by farmers against agri laws||Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati on Sunday said that her party will support a peaceful ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by farmers against the Centre’s three farm laws.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha has given a Bharat Bandh call for September 27.In a tweet in Hindi, Mayawati said, “The farmers of the country do not endorse the three farm laws brought in a hurry by the Centre, and are sad about it. They have been protesting for the past 10 months in the country and aggressively, especially around Delhi. They have given the call of ‘Bharat Bandh’, and BSP supports its peaceful organising.”    The Centre, she said, should hold proper consultations with farmers and bring a new law with their agreement.In another tweet, the BSP chief said, “The Centre is once again requested to withdraw the three farm laws while showing appropriate sympathy and sensitivity to farmers. The Centre should hold proper consultation with the farmers, and bring a new law with their agreement, so that this problem could be solved. If the farmer is happy and prosperous, then the country will also become happy and prosperous.”              The government and farmer unions have held 11 rounds of talks so far, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock and end the farmers’ protest. Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26.The three laws—The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- were passed by Parliament in September last year.Farmer groups have alleged that these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced and asserted that these steps will help increase farmers’ income.The Supreme Court had in January stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and appointed a panel to resolve the impasse.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mayawati-extends-support-to-bandh-called-by-farmers-against-agri-laws-316480

26-09-2021||Mumbai||Is there any need to open cinema, drama halls when BJP ‘entertaining’ people, asks Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday took a swipe at the BJP, claiming it was providing “entertainment” to people, and questioned the need for opening cinema halls and drama auditoriums during the COVID-19 pandemic.Notably, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has said cinema halls and drama theatres in the state will be permitted to operate from October 22 on the condition that they follow all the protocols required to prevent the spread of coronavirus.In his weekly column ‘Rokhthok’ in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana, Raut, who is the executive editor of the Marathi daily, said the opposition party (BJP) in Maharashtra has “crossed all limits”.“Every day, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya levels new allegations against different state ministers and visits their constituencies. I feel the state government shouldn’t stop his tours. His allegations are like soap bubbles.  Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil has a different style,” he quipped.“Even though the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions continue, political entertainment programmes are on in the country. In all, there is fun everywhere...there is mystery and comedy in the entertainment that is being provided by the opposition party. Is there a need to open cinema halls and drama auditoriums?” he wondered.Raut, whose party shares power with the NCP and Congress in Maharashtra, claimed that the state BJP unit has made a “mockery” of Central probe agencies.He said Maharashtra had a rich tradition of illustrious opposition leaders like Madhu Dandavate, Madhu Limaye, George Fernandes and Hiren Mukherjee, who launched fierce agitations against the then governments and exposed corruption. Indira Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi also bore the brunt, he said.In Maharashtra, leaders like Datta Patil, Mrunal Gore, Keshavrao Dhondge, Krushnarao Dhulap and Gopinath Munde kept various state governments on tenterhooks, but there was no viciousness as in the present times, the Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson said.Chief ministers like Shivajirao Nilangekar, A R Antulay and Vilasrao Deshmukh had to quit because of the opposition attack, he noted.“Today, the Opposition is a just a comedy show. It is doing nothing, but threatening of ED inquiries and indulging in character assassination,” he claimed.

"Of these, 107 gang-members are currently lodged in different jails," he said.The police have made a comprehensive strategy to tackle the three-tier structure of organised crime. The first tier has top gangsters, out of which most of them are in jails. The second-tier gangsters are usually those who provide logistical support such as arms and ammunition to the third-tier criminals that actually commit the crime on the ground.On Saturday, the police arrested two persons, identified as Umang Yadav (22) and Vinay Mota (19), in connection with the Rohini Court shootout.The police have now learnt that Gogi, Lawrence Bishnoi and Kala Jatheri had made an alliance. Pertinently, both Lawrence Bishnoi and Kala Jatheri are currently lodged in different jails and are running a nexus of crime from there.Gogi's murder case has now been transferred to the Crime Branch and it is currently probing the incident.Of the two arrested on Saturday, Yadav has revealed that he worked for Tillu Tajpuriya, currently lodged at the Mandoli jail, for the last two years. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-police-to-hold-high-level-security-meet-with-northern-states-uts-to-tackle-organised-crime-316473

Dr. Manmohan Singh, you are the leader India truly deserves.”                “#HappyBirthdayDrMMS, the Congress party & the entire nation cherishes you & your immense contributions- today & everyday. Thank you for everything you’ve done,” the party tweeted.The Congress said Singh’s unbridled commitment to India’s progress -- right from the time of being the finance minister to the prime minister to even today -- has benefitted every Indian to a scale unimaginable.In a Facebook post, Gandhi said, “Happy birthday to Dr. Manmohan Singh ji. He is fearless and brilliant with a great understanding of the issues our country has been facing.

26-09-2021||Washington||When former Indian PM Manmohan Singh, ex-US President Barack Obama both claimed Indra Nooyi is one of theirs||Indian-American Indra Nooyi, the former chairperson and CEO of PepsiCo, still vividly remembers a 2009 meeting with the then US president Barack Obama and former prime minister Manmohan Singh during which both claimed: “she is one of us”.“I belong in both worlds,” Chennai-born Nooyi, 65, writes in her new memoir “My Life in Full: Work, Family, and Our Future,” recollecting the memorable events of November 2009 when Obama had hosted Singh for his first state dinner.In the memoir, set to hit the bookstores next Tuesday, Nooyi describes the events that shaped her life from childhood to her becoming Pepsico CEO, a position from which she retired in 2018.“One foggy Tuesday in November 2009, after hours of meetings in Washington, DC, with two dozen top US and Indian business executives, I found myself standing between the president of the United States and the prime minister of India,” she writes in the introduction of the memoir that runs into over 300 pages.“Barack Obama and Manmohan Singh had entered the room for an update on our group’s progress, and President Obama began introducing the American team to his Indian counterpart. When he got to me—Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo—Prime Minister Singh exclaimed, “Oh! But she is one of us!” “And the president, with a big smile and without missing a beat, responded, “Ah, but she is one of us, too!”      “It’s a moment I never forget—spontaneous kindness from the leaders of the two great countries that have given me so much,” Nooyi writes in the memoir, an advance copy of which was obtained by PTI.“I am still the girl who grew up in a close family in Madras, in the South of India, and I am deeply connected to the lessons and culture of my youth. I am also the woman who arrived in the US at age twenty-three to study and work and, somehow, rose to lead an iconic company, a journey that I believe is possible only in America. I belong in both worlds,” she writes, narrating her immigrant story.From a sari-clad intern at Booz Allen Hamilton rising to the post of Pepsico CEO, Nooyi writes that the business world has improved immeasurably for women in the US since she started her professional career.Nooyi writes that more recently, the #MeToo movement and Time’s Up campaigns have had a profound impact on exposing the degree to which women are subjected to sexual violence and harassment. The movement and campaigns have created a necessary community for survivors, she observes.“I was never sexually assaulted. I did witness and hear about plenty of male behaviour early in my days in the corporate world that offended my sense of decency and my values. I later made it a priority to shut down offensive behaviour as soon as I saw it or it became known,” Nooyi writes.Nooyi says after she became PepsiCo’s president, she instructed the compliance department to address harassment complaints made to their anonymous Speak Up Line immediately.“We were quick to fire confirmed harassers,” she writes.In the book, she rues that women hold just 26 per cent of US corporate board seats.“In my view, companies should consider setting term limits on board members of fifteen years and a mandatory retirement age of seventy-two. Immediately, they could also expand their boards by one or two members to make room for qualified people who better understand the issues facing working women and young families,” she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/when-former-indian-pm-manmohan-singh-ex-us-president-barack-obama-both-claimed-indra-nooyi-is-one-of-theirs-316458

We see a trend towards much more regionalisation of the supply chain. We will certainly be diving deep into that,” the official said.Biswal said the challenges and opportunities represented by the collaboration on combating climate change are going to be another key area of focus.“Coming out of or being in the midst of the Covid pandemic, we will certainly have a focus on health, and both on the emerging health technology that we are seeing, but also reflection on the pandemic challenges and the ways in which our two countries are working on that. “As we look at emerging technology and kind of our digital future, we will be having discussions on the kind of the future of technology looking at not just 5G, but 6G, quantum communications and how the future technology collaboration between our two countries and the role of the private sector in that space,” she added. In its latest newsletter to USIBC members early this week, Biswal had said this year’s summit would be a mix of reflection and prediction, helping guide the attendees as to what they might expect from the global trade, strategic and economic scene in the coming months.“As with past practice, we will announce two USIBC Annual Global Leadership awardees at the Summit—both transformational leaders in their own right—and offer a unique honour this year.

The cases rose from 11.5 lakh in 2019 to 13.9 lakh in 2020, according to the national cancer registry data.The initial analysis of hospital-based cancer cases in the country by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) shows the proportion of cases was 52.4 per cent in males and 47.6 per cent in females, with males more marginally predisposed to the disease than women. Among women, gynaecological cancers (including breast cancer) accounted for over half of the cases. Cancers of the head and neck region accounted for nearly one-third of the cases among males.Cancer associated with tobacco use comprised 48.7 per cent cases in males, while childhood cancers (0-14 years) comprised 7.9 per cent of all cancer cases. “The age group of 45 to 64 years reported the highest proportion of cancer from all sites except for prostate cancer which affects people over 65 years and more,” says Dr Prashant Mathur, Director, ICMR’s National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (NCDIR), Bengaluru, which conducted the study.The ICMR report was based on seven-year data of cancer cases from 96 hospital-based cancer registries under the National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP). The cancer data pertained to all diagnosed and treated patients of confirmed malignancies who reported for treatment at these centres across all regions of the country. This report included data from 61,00,84 diagnosed cancer cases who were registered in the NCRP between 2012-2019.It said chemotherapy was the most used treatment for cancers in India and patients were starting on treatment 8 to 30 days after detection.“Cancer is posing as a key public health challenge for India. In 2020 alone, there were an estimated 1.39 million cancer cases in the country. This report is the first-ever comprehensive analysis of data from a large set hospital-based cancer registry data and will help inform policy,” said Mathur.Men more vulnerable||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cancer-cases-rise-21-in-a-year-45-64-age-group-most-affected-316134

Petitioner Vishal Tiwari cited similar incidents in Bijnor, Barwani, Amritsar and Hisar to emphasise the fact that it was not the first incident of this kind.“Such incidents are not only a threat to our judicial officers, lawyers and people present on the court premises, but it is also a threat to our justice system. The court is a place where people are in the shelter of law but they fall victim in courts of unlawful activities,” he said.The issue of safety and security of court complexes and judicial officers is already under the consideration of the top court which is likely to take it up on a priority basis next week. Chief Justice of India NV Ramana had on Friday expressed deep concern at the Rohini court shootout.Tiwari demanded that hardcore criminals be produced through video-conferencing before the trial courts from jails, instead of producing them physically in the courts.He urged the top court to direct states to open armed police posts in district court complexes as also at the “taluka-level judiciary”.“Security and CCTV cameras should be installed in the district court complexes of our country, so that every incident may be caught in its true scene and occurrence,” he demanded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-supreme-court-seeks-cover-for-judges-and-lawyers-316135

This is a major problem not limited to the Rohini court alone. This has been observed in other lower courts as well. The police are in touch with the Bar Association of Rohini court and it is cooperating,” said another police official.Gogi was shot dead by two men, who were dressed as lawyers, inside the crowded courtroom on Friday, with police in retaliatory fire killing the assailants, who are suspected to be from the slain gangster’s rival Tillu gang.The police said that the metal detectors at the Rohini court were working at the time of the incident.

She went on the offensive highlighting the violence against minorities in Pakistan as well as the “religious and cultural genocide” in erstwhile East Pakistan.Dubey asserted that unlike Pakistan, India was a pluralistic democracy with a substantial population of minorities who had gone on to hold the highest offices in the country. She strongly reiterated that the entire UTs of J&K and Ladakh “were, are and will always be an integral and inalienable part of India”. “This includes the areas that are under the illegal occupation of Pakistan. We call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir or PoK),” she said.Her broadside triggered a response from Pakistani diplomat Saima Saleem, who countered the assertion that Kashmir was India’s internal issue.

He called for improving the effectiveness and reliability of the UN and its organs.Their ineffectiveness during the climate and the Afghan crises had deepened these issues, he said, in one of the sharpest calls by the PM for reforms in the UN and the UNSC. The PM highlighted India’s democratic credentials. Citing his own example, he said: “A little boy who would help his father at the railway station is today addressing the UNGA for the fourth time as PM.”Pointing out that he had been the longest-serving CM of Gujarat and had then spent seven years as PM, he said, “I can say from experience that yes democracy can deliver, yes democracy has delivered.” The PM invoked the “integral humanism” of Deendayal Upadhyaya on his birth anniversary. The PM said it was essential that terrorists were denied the use of Afghanistan’s territory. “The world also needs to ensure no country tries to take advantage of the situation in Afghanistan. At this time, the people of Afghanistan, women, children and minorities need help. We must fulfil our duty by providing them help,” he observed.The PM drew a contrast between India, trying to strengthen a science-based approach, and some countries with regressive thinking using terrorism as a political tool. In a veiled attack on Pakistan, he said nations using terrorism as a political tool must understand that it was an “equally big threat” for them too.He wanted the international community to speak in one voice for strengthening a world order based on rules to protect the oceans from the “race for expansion”.India, he said, had started work on making the country the world’s largest green hydrogen hub and had developed the world’s first DNA vaccine for children.

The day coincides with the birth anniversary of Shaheed Bhagat Singh.Both the leaders have switched off their cell phones and only phones of those close to them are working.Both the leaders had met Rahul Gandhi recently and sources say talks have been finalised between these leaders and the Congress.

These villages are inhabited by their people who come and live in and impress the local Indian population how well off they are with the Chinese government."These are intelligence operations, security operations from their side. They try to 'turn people anti-India'. So we are training our police personnel, regarding these attempts and sensitising them on how to counter their moves," Krishan Varma, a member of the Advisory Board to the Global Counter Terrorism Council told IANS.Varma, a former special secretary with the Government of India (GoI), was at the Rashtriya Raksha University (RRU) in Gandhinagar on Friday in a programme marking the end of a 12-day specialised training programme for 16 probationary Deputy Superintendents of Arunachal Pradesh Police at RRU. He's also the Emeritus Resource Faculty, School of International Cooperation, Security and Strategic Languages with Media at RRU."So the RRU has designed a special tailor-made course for Arunachal Pradesh Police, so as to counter the Chinese attempts of infiltration. The RRU-designed programme is specific to the needs of the northeastern state and was created in consultation with Arunachal Pradesh DGP RP Upadhyaya, who had visited Gujarat two months ago," said Varma.The RRU sessions trained the personnel not only in forensics and investigation techniques but also provided an introduction to the dark web, cybercrime and crime scene management, internet banking, fraud, fake news detection, and Chinese and internal security challenges for police officers in the northeast."They (Chinese) are very advanced in the field of technology, especially the internet and social media. They are using social networking sites to mislead the people of India, to spread false narratives. So we taught them these. The northeastern border areas are very sensitive and it's absolutely necessary for them to know about such attempts of subversion," added Varma."We are also teaching them Mandarin (Chinese language) as the persons infiltrating speak it. The university has designed a one-year course which gives a basic knowledge of the language. In future, the RRU has plans to come up with five-year course of Masters, where they'll understand their culture, history, needs, habits and policies," added Varma.

The UK is open to travel and we're already seeing a lot of people going from India to the UK, be it tourists, business people or students," British High Commissioner Alex Ellis had said in a statement on Wednesday."We have been having detailed technical discussions regarding certification, with the builders of the CoWin app and the NHS app, about both apps. They're happening at a rapid pace, to ensure that both countries mutually recognise the vaccine certificates issued by each other," he had said.

26-09-2021||---||Indo-US alliance to define security, economic landscape, says Modi-Biden Joint Statement||New Delhi, September 25The decisions taken at the bilateral meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden in Washington on Friday would define the economic and security landscape of the next century, said a Joint Statement.  The two sides will build a strategic partnership and work together with regional groupings, including ASEAN and Quad, developing a trade and investment partnership, finishing the fight against the pandemic, scale up climate action, strengthen democratic values and enhance people-to-people ties, said a Joint Statement after the meeting.On climate change, Biden acknowledged the importance of finance as India plans to install 450 GW of renewable power by 2030. This will be done by the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership (SCEP) and the recently-launched Climate Action and Finance Mobilisation Dialogue (CAFMD), said the Joint Statement.Biden expressed his “unwavering commitment” to India in defence by information and logistics sharing, expanding engagements in a multilateral framework and greater military-to-military interaction. The recent project to co-develop air-launched UAVs and the forthcoming Industrial Security Agreement summit, they hoped, would facilitate high-end defence industrial collaboration.They resolved to take actions against all terrorist groups and called for the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks to be brought to justice. The Joint Statement “denounced” the use of terrorist proxies and noted that the upcoming US-India dialogues on counterterrorism, designations and internal security would further strengthen counterterrorism cooperation, including in intelligence sharing and law enforcement cooperation. A new Bilateral Framework for counter narcotics would facilitate joint efforts to combat drug trafficking, illicit narcotics production and precursor chemical supply chains, it noted.The leaders wanted the Taliban to abide by UNSC Resolution 2593, which demands that Afghan territory must not be misused, allow orderly departure from Afghanistan and respect human rights. However, with regard to an inclusive government, they resolved to “coordinate and to work jointly with partners”. This is an indication that both countries may not be on the same page on this aspect.Biden also reiterated US support for India’s permanent membership on a reformed UNSC and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. They also looked forward to the launch of the US-India Gandhi-King Development Foundation to advance cooperation on health, education, and the environment as well as convene the Trade Policy Forum before the end of the year.Independent of the Quad’s efforts in regional infrastructure, the two leaders discussed jointly proposing “sustainable and transparent rules of the road” that will lift economies throughout the Indo-Pacific.On immigration, there were no firm commitments from the US side but its mention was on a positive note. “The leaders noted that the movement of highly skilled professionals, students, investors and business travellers between their countries enhanced their economic and technological partnership,” it said.Biden and Modi resolved to expand their partnership to areas of critical and emerging technology – space, cyber, health security, semiconductors, AI, 5G, 6G and Blockchain, that will define global leadership in the next decade.They also welcomed increasing partnerships to counter ransomware and other cyber-enabled crime, including combating cybercriminals operating from within their borders. A Space Situational Awareness MoU will help in sharing of data and services to ensure the long-term sustainability of outer space activities by the end of the year, said the statement.Modi conveyed his deep appreciation for the repatriation of antiquities and both leaders committed to strengthening their efforts to combat the theft, illicit trade and trafficking of cultural objects.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indo-us-alliance-to-define-security-economic-landscape-says-modi-biden-joint-statement-316017
26-09-2021||United Nations||Immediately vacate POK, India says in reply to Pakistan PM Imran Khan's UN General Assembly address||Pakistan, where terrorists enjoy free pass, is an "arsonist" disguising itself as a "fire-fighter", and the entire world has suffered because of its policies as the country nurtures terrorists in its backyard, India has said in a blistering retort after Prime Minister Imran Khan raked up the issue of Kashmir in his address to the UN General Assembly.Also read: ‘Check facts’, says India after group of UK MPs seeks debate on Kashmir"We exercise our Right of Reply to one more attempt by the leader of Pakistan to tarnish the image of this august forum by bringing in matters internal to my country, and going so far as to spew falsehoods on the world stage,” First Secretary Sneha Dubey said in the UN General Assembly on Friday."While such statements deserve our collective contempt and sympathy for the mindset of the person who utters falsehood repeatedly, I am taking the floor to set the record straight,” the young Indian diplomat said, slamming the Pakistani leader for raking up the Kashmir issue in his address to the 76th session of the UN General Assembly."We keep hearing that Pakistan is a 'victim of terrorism'. This is the country which is an arsonist disguising itself as a fire-fighter. Pakistan nurtures terrorists in their backyard in the hope that they will only harm their neighbours. Our region, and in fact the entire world, has suffered because of their policies. On the other hand, they are trying to cover up sectarian violence in their country as acts of terror," Dubey said.Khan in his address had spoken about the August 5, 2019 decision of the Indian government on the abrogation of Article 370 as well as the death of pro-Pakistan separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani.In the Right of Reply, Dubey strongly reiterated that the entire Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh "were, are and will always be an integral and inalienable part of India. This includes the areas that are under the illegal occupation of Pakistan. We call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation.”Khan and other Pakistani leaders and diplomats have consistently raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and other internal matters of India in their addresses to the UN General Assembly and other forums of the world organisation.Pakistan's attempts to internationalise the Kashmir issue have gained no traction from the international community and the Member States, who maintain that Kashmir is a bilateral matter between the two countries.Dubey said it is regrettable that this is not the first time the leader of Pakistan has "misused" platforms provided by the UN to "propagate false and malicious propaganda against my country, and seeking in vain to divert the world's attention from the sad state of his country where terrorists enjoy free pass while the lives of ordinary people, especially those belonging to the minority communities, are turned upside down."               With the international community marking this month the solemn occasion of the 20th anniversary of the “dastardly” 9/11 terror attacks, Dubey said the world has not forgotten that the "mastermind behind that dastardly event, Osama Bin Laden, got shelter in Pakistan. Even today, Pakistan leadership glorify him as a 'martyr'."              "Regrettably, even today we heard the leader of Pakistan trying to justify acts of terror. Such defence of terrorism is unacceptable in the modern world."      Categorically emphasising India's position, Dubey said New Delhi desires normal relations "with all our neighbours, including Pakistan." However, it is for Islamabad to work sincerely towards creating a conducive atmosphere, including by taking credible, verifiable and irreversible actions to not allow any territory under its control to be used for cross border terrorism against India in any manner.Asserting that Member States are aware that Pakistan has an established history and policy of harbouring, aiding and actively supporting terrorists, Dubey said the country has been globally recognised as one openly supporting, training, financing and arming terrorists as a matter of State policy. "It holds the ignoble record of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the UN Security Council."            Watch: India exercises its right of reply at the #UNGA @AmbTSTirumurti @MEAIndia @harshvshringla pic.twitter.com/YGcs28fYYa  "This is also the country that still holds the despicable record in our region of having executed a religious and cultural genocide against the people of what is now Bangladesh. As we mark the 50th anniversary this year of that horrid event in history, there is not even an acknowledgment, much less accountability,” the Indian diplomat said.Highlighting that minorities in Pakistan - the Sikhs, Hindus, Christians - live in constant fear and state sponsored suppression of their rights, he said, "this is a regime where anti-Semitism is normalised by its leadership and even justified."Dissenting voices are muzzled daily, and enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings are well documented."      Dubey said that unlike Pakistan, India is a pluralistic democracy with a substantial population of minorities who have gone on to hold highest offices in the country including as President, Prime Minister, Chief Justices and Chiefs of Army Staff. India is also a country with a free media and an independent judiciary that keeps a watch and protects our Constitution."Pluralism is a concept which is very difficult to understand for Pakistan which constitutionally prohibits its minorities from aspiring for high offices of the State. The least they could do is introspect before exposing themselves to ridicule on the world stage," the Indian diplomat said.
