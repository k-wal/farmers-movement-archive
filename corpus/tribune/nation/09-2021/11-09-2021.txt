11-09-2021||New Delhi||President Ram Nath Kovind advocates greater representation of women in judiciary||President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday advocated greater representation of women in the judiciary to achieve a just and equitable society.“If we have to achieve the inclusive ideals of our Constitution, then the role of women in the judiciary also has to be increased…A just society will only be truly achieved when women are represented in the justice system, in addition to all other fields. Today, including the Supreme Court and high courts, there are less than 12 per cent women judges,” the President said at the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Uttar Pradesh National Law University in Allahabad.“If we want to achieve the Directive Principles of our Constitution, we must increase the participation of women in the judiciary,” he said, expressing the hope that the number of women lawyers, officials, and judges in the Allahabad High Court would increase.Maintaining that women have proven to be better equipped and more inclined to impart justice, he said.“Ordinarily, women have a greater inclination towards justice. There may be certain exceptions to this; however, they have the nature, mentality, and quality to impart justice. Be it parents, in-laws, husband or children- working women maintain a balance amongst all and yet, in their workplace act as examples of excellence,” he said.He said there was a need to ensure adequate facilities for the subordinate judiciary and increase the number of working judges.Referring to the Allahabad High Court’s historic decision to enroll India’s first woman lawyer Cornelia Sorabji in 1921, the President termed that decision a forward-looking decision in the direction of women empowerment.He said last month, a new history was created of the women’s participation in the judiciary with the appointment of nine judges, including three women judges, in the Supreme Court.The presence of four women judges out of the total 33 judges appointed in the Supreme Court is the highest ever in the history of the judiciary. He said that these appointments have paved the way for a woman Chief Justice of India in future, he noted.He said, “I have seen the struggle of the poor to access justice from close quarters…Everybody should receive timely justice; the system should be affordable, judgments should be easy for common citizens to understand. Especially women and weaker sections should receive justice, this is our responsibility. This will only be possible when there is a change in the thought process and work culture of all stakeholders associated with the justice system and there is sensitivity.”The President said: “Everybody has an expectation from the judiciary, but ordinarily people hesitate from seeking judicial intervention. To increase the public faith in the judiciary, we must change this situation”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/president-ram-nath-kovind-advocates-greater-representation-of-women-in-judiciary-309810

The plane coming from Dubai had overshot the runway at Kozhikode airport and later broke into pieces. There were 190 people onboard the ill-fated aircraft and at least 20 people, including the two pilots, were killed and several others were injured.The report, released little over a year after the deadly crash of the Air India Express plane, said the “probable cause of the accident was the non-adherence to SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) by the PF (Pilot Flying)”.The PF continued an unstabilised approach and landed beyond the touchdown zone, “half way down the runway, in spite of ‘Go Around’ call by PM which warranted a mandatory ‘Go Around’ and the failure of the PM to take over controls and execute a ‘Go Around’”, it noted.

PTI photoIn another shot, he was captured sitting along with his supporters on a waterlogged street with police barricades behind him. Donning a saffron 'safa' (headgear) and dressed casually, he also posed for a single picture of himself.Tikait has been protesting on the outskirts of the national capital against three farm laws passed by the Parliament in September 2020.Some areas in the national capital were so waterlogged that children were seen swimming and playing in the seemingly deep water.Delhi and its adjoining areas received heavy rainfall on Saturday morning which led to major traffic disruption due to waterlogging. Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issued an orange alert for the day as it recorded its heaviest rainfall in a day since 2010. According to MeT officials, with the rain forecast for the weekend, Delhi could beat the record in September itself.Pictures and videos surfacing from areas like Madhu Vihar, Jorbagh, Motibagh, RK Puram, Sadar Bazar area and ITO showed vehicles stuck in the middle of roads partially inundated, slowing down the traffic to a snail's pace.

11-09-2021||New Delhi||India urges Australia to address students’ difficulties due to travel restrictions||India on Saturday urged Australia to sympathetically address as soon as possible the difficulties being faced by Indian students due to the travel restrictions put in place by that country in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.The issue was taken up during deliberations when External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh held the inaugural ‘two-plus-two’ dialogue here with their Australian counterparts Marise Payne and Peter Dutton.“I specifically took up with Minister Payne the problems faced by Indian students in Australia and those wishing to go to Australia as well as the Indian origin community that is resident there,” Jaishankar said at a press event after the talks.Jaishankar said during the talks he urged that the difficulties faced by students due to travel restrictions be sympathetically addressed as soon as possible.“I think their (students’) frustrations, their feelings are completely understandable. Many of them would like to be at the institutions that they are already studying or want to study. So we discussed it in some detail today. Minister Payne shared with me what is Australia’s thinking about when students will be able to come,” he said.Jaishankar said the Indian government has taken up the issue of problems being faced by students due to travel restrictions not just with Australia but with other countries like the US and Canada.“So I do want the students of the country and the parents of the students to know that it is something we take as very high priority and take up very vigorously with our foreign partners,” he said.Australian Foreign Minister Payne said she understands the desire of students and their families that are not able to be in Australia for education and their desire for on campus experience.The Covid-19 restrictions have impacted travel to and from Australia, not just for students, but for Australians themselves and even for ministers, she said.“We (ministers) are required to comply with the same sort of quarantine restrictions and health requirements as all incoming travellers as you would expect. So our approach in Australia has been based on research and modelling commissioned by the government from the eminent Doherty institute and that gives us a four-phase pathway in terms of our response to COVID-19 and our progression through and out of the restrictions that have been in place,” Payne said.She said her country is on the way to vaccinating Australians to a level which will give Australia the confidence to begin the sort of reopening that will enable students to return in phase three and then in phase four, a much more opened environment for international travel.“There is shared desire on both sides to see that travel resume between our countries as soon as it is safe to do so. I look forward to being one of the people at the airport to welcome the first arrivals of Indian students coming back to Australia,” she said.Earlier, Jaishankar said he and the other ministers came together for the first time and also discussed their experiences and further collaboration in responding to the Covid-19 challenges.Decentralised globalisation, strategic autonomy and sharper sense of national security are some of the relevant outcomes, he noted.“We also underlined our commitments to creating secure and resilient global supply chains. We welcomed the renewed vigour with which both sides are now engaging on trade issues to fully expedite the complementarities between us,” Jaishankar said.

11-09-2021||Allahabad||Allahabad HC’s 1975 verdict disqualifying then PM Indira Gandhi was judgment of great courage: CJI||The 1975 verdict of Justice Jagmohanlal Sinha of the Allahabad High Court disqualifying then prime minister Indira Gandhi on charges of electoral malpractices was a judgment of “great courage” that “shook” the nation, leading to imposition of Emergency, CJI N V Ramana said on Saturday.The Chief Justice of India (CJI), who along with President Ram Nath Kovind, took part in programmes, including the foundation stone-laying ceremony of the Uttar Pradesh National Law University here and a new building complex of the Allahabad High Court, recalled the rich traditions and contributions of one of the oldest high courts in the country.“In 1975, it was Justice Jagmohanlal Sinha from the Allahabad High Court who passed the judgment that shook the nation, when he disqualified Smt. Indira Gandhi. It was a judgment of great courage, which could be said to have directly resulted in the declaration of Emergency. The consequences of which I do not want to elaborate now,” Justice Ramana said.The CJI said the Allahabad High Court has a history of more than 150 years and its Bar and Bench have produced some of the greatest legal luminaries in the country.The June 12, 1975, verdict delivered by Justice Jagmohanlal Sinha of the Allahabad High Court had convicted the then prime minister of electoral malpractices and debarred her from holding any elected post under the Representative of Peoples Act.The verdict is widely believed to have led to imposition of Emergency on June 25, 1975.Indira Gandhi had won the 1971 Lok Sabha election from the Rae Bareli seat in Uttar Pradesh by defeating her opponent Raj Narain.The defeated leader had challenged her election alleging electoral malpractices saying that Gandhi’s election agent Yashpal Kapoor was a government servant and that she used government officials for personal election related work.

In those orders, it was mentioned that the exam would be held after August 31. Then the earliest possible date was announced for September 11,” Professor Lal said.He said 1,66,259 candidates appeared for the NEET-PG on Saturday and all were provided protective gears comprising a face shield, mask and hand sanitiser for the safe conduct of the exam.On the day exams were held, the Delhi-NCR region received heavy rainfall leading to waterlogging and traffic jams in several parts of the city.The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET)– Undergraduate, 2021, will be held on September 12.

So, you should do your work and earn the name,” he told the ruling BJP.The number of job opportunities in the railways has fallen to 12 lakh from 16 lakh during the BJP rule. The jobs in the telecom sector have also come down. The government can consider privatising loss-making enterprises, but they are now keen on privatising sectors which are making profit, the Congress leader said.On the Kalaburagi city Corporation election results in Karnataka, Kharge said Congress has emerged as the single largest party with 27 seats while BJP got 23. Talks are on with Janata Dal (secular) which got four seats and an independent, and their response is awaited, he said.Earlier in the day, Kharge visited Congress veteran Oscar Fernandes at a hospital in the city, where he is undergoing treatment, and enquired about his health.Kharge later said he spoke to Fernandes' wife, family members and doctors treating him.“Oscar and I have been sharing a very cordial relationship since the 80s,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/people-should-rise-against-sale-of-psu-assets-says-congress-leader-kharge-309790

In a surprise move, Rupani on Saturday resigned as Chief Minister of Gujarat almost 15 months before state polls, becoming fourth chief minister to be changed in six months in three states - Uttarakhand, Karnataka and Gujarat.In March, the saffron party replaced Uttarakhand’s then chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat with Lok Sabha member Tirath Singh Rawat.In July, four months after being made chief minister, Tirath Singh Rawat was replaced by two-time MLA Pushkar Singh Dhami.After Uttarakhand, BJP replaced B.S. Yediyurappa with B.S. Bommai.A party leader claimed that chief ministers in Gujarat and Karnataka were replaced to bring in new leadership in the state. “In Karnataka, there was strong resentment against the chief minister and his son. Similarly there was demand in Gujarat unit for removal of Rupani by a section of the party saying it will be difficult to win next year’s state polls under his leadership,” he said.While in Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat was replaced to bring in a new face but Tirath Singh Rawat removed due his failure to get elected to state assembly within six months of being sworn in as chief minister of state.Among all the replacement of BJP chief ministers, the current change of guard in Gujarat took place without any buzz. “There was a discussion and demand from a section in the party to change the chief minister but no one expected that news would come this way. We have no idea that it will be announced after submitting resignation,” a party leader from Gujarat said.In March, before replacing Trivendra Singh Rawat, the BJP had sent two members to the state, which included former Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh, to collect feedback. Similarly before replacing Tirath Singh Rawat, the BJP central leadership had called him to the national capital and explained to him about the constitutional and legal crisis. Amid months of speculation about a change of guard in Karnataka, Yediyurappa had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and top BJP leadership. Yediyurappa took his time and resigned after completion of two years of his government in July.

His influence among Muslim community had endeared him to Mayawati.A source in BSP said at a tactical level, Mayawati is mindful of the ruling BJP led by UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, certain to make law and order an election issue. Ansari as a candidate would have out the BSP on the backfoot.Yogi Adityanath has a dominating presence in eastern UP, where BJP is planning a big push to make up for possible loss in the number of assembly seats in Western UP which has been reportedly affected by the farmers’ agitation against the three Central agri-laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bsp-denies-ticket-to-mukhtar-ansari-apprehending-resentment-among-hindu-voters-309774

Any other interpretation, would not only frustrate the very purpose of this beneficial legislation, but, it would also undermine the use of this important and easily accessible tool of Video Conferencing,” the judge said in her order dated September 9.She said the Delhi (Compulsory Registration of Marriage) Order, 2014 is welfare legislation, promulgated at the instance the Supreme Court to encourage the registration of marriages.“The insistence of physical appearance even when their personal appearance can be easily secured through video conferencing, will definitely make it more cumbersome for parties to come forward for the registration of marriages. This will negate the very purpose of enactment of the Registration Order and cannot be permitted,” the order further reads.The court allowed the couple to mark their “personal appearance” before the Registering Authority through video conferencing after submitting their application for the registration of marriage through their counsel/Power of Attorney Holder in physical form alongwith copies of all supporting documents duly notarized, either by the notary public in the United States of America or by a notary public here.It directed that the two witnesses would appear physically before the Registering Authority with their original ID proofs on the date notified by the Registering Authority.The Authority will then expeditiously register the marriage and issue the Marriage Registration Certificate within a period of two weeks’ from the date of receipt of the application, the court added.In the present case, the couple claimed that their marriage was solemnised in 2001 as per Hindu rituals, but they did not get the same registered as they moved abroad prior to the introduction of the Delhi (Compulsory Registration of Marriage) Order, 2014.Considering that their application for a green card was now not being processed in the United States for want of a marriage certificate, the couple approached the local authority here for issuance of a marriage certificate, who maintained that physical presence of the parties was a mandatory requirement.The couple, represented through senior counsel Vibha Datta Makhija, moved the high court after their representation to the authority concerned for virtual appearance remained unanswered.The court observed that while the “universe has undergone a sea change” since the time when the Registration Order was notified, the Registering Authority was “refusing to recognize the reality that with the technology as is available today, web portals and Video Conferencing have become almost the norm”.Acknowledging the acceptance of video-conferencing even in the judicial system in this country, the court said that “these aspects appear to have been simply overlooked by the Registering Authority, who is continuing to insist on that the parties must remain present physically before him”.“I am of the view that, in times such as these, when technology has proven to be the bridge that ensured uninterrupted communication, widespread dissemination of information in public interest and the smooth functioning of society, the Court cannot allow a rigid interpretation of the statute to prevent citizens from exercising their rights,” the judge said.The court stated that the task assigned to the Registering Authority was to register a marriage that has already been solemnised, clarifying the “misconception that a marriage is being solemnized before the Registering Authority”.

But our economy has recovered more strongly than it was halted by the pandemic,” Modi said while virtually addressing a gathering after inaugurating Sardhardham Bhavan here, a complex for providing training to job aspirants.“When big economies of the world were busy defending themselves during the pandemic, we were carrying out reforms. When the global supply chains were disrupted, we introduced the PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme to turn new opportunities in favour of India,” Modi said.This scheme has been extended to the textile sector now, he said, adding that the textile sector and cities like Surat can take maximum benefit of the scheme.As per the data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Tuesday, India’s economic growth surged to 20.1 per cent in the April-June quarter of this fiscal, helped by a low base of the year-ago period, despite a devastating second wave of COVID-19. The gross domestic product (GDP) had contracted by 24.4 per cent in the corresponding April-June quarter of 2020-21.The PLI scheme announced for 10 key sectors, including textile and automobiles by the Centre, is aimed at helping the country’s economy recover faster after the pandemic.“We should look upon ourselves as global economic leader as in the 21st century, India does not have a scarcity of opportunities to make it big,” Modi said.

Bhopal CJM rejected their plea and the decision was upheld by MP HC.Accepting senior Advocate Siddhartha Dave’s arguments that the Bhopal CJM’s order was beyond his jurisdiction, the top court allowed the appeal and held that they were entitled to default bail.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/magistrates-cant-extend-deadline-completion-of-probe-filing-of-chargesheet-under-uapa-sc-309323
