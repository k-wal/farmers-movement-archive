In the screenshots of the WhatsApp messages that were circulated, the journalist could be seen asking whether it was a good time to talk regarding a news story.To this Prasanth replied with just a sticker. When she replied saying the story was not to harm him and asked him to give a statement regarding the controversy, he replied with an inappropriate and obscene sticker.A complaint was filed with the police by the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ).The state government later in May had ordered a probe against the 2007 batch IAS officer for his alleged misbehaviour.  --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/case-against-ias-officer-for-sending-inappropriate-whatsapp-sticker-to-woman-journalist-307974

07-09-2021||New Delhi||Holistic improvement in air quality one of government’s top priority, says Environment Minister||Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav inaugurated what he called the national capital’s “first functional smog tower” at Anand Vihar to mark the Second International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies.Last month, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also inaugurated a smog tower at Connaught Place.A smog tower is a structure designed as large/medium scale air purifiers to reduce air pollution, usually by forcing the air through filters. It comes ahead of the period in Delhi when pollution levels rise due to various local and other factors, like stubble burning by farmers in neighbouring states.At Tuesday’s inauguration, Yadav said he hoped that the smog tower would help supplement the efforts to improve Delhi’s air quality and said the central government had launched several initiatives to improve air quality across the country, with the Prime Minister himself setting a goal for holistic improvement in air quality in more than 100 cities.“Eighty-six cities showed better air quality in 2019 in comparison to 2018, which increased to 104 cities in 2020”, he said at the event that also saw the launch of a portal named ‘PRANA” – Portal for Regulation of Air-pollution in Non-Attainment cities under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)’,” he said.NCAP targets 20 per cent to 30 per cent reduction in Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5) by 2024 across the country, officials said. The portal will support tracking of physical as well as financial status of city air action plan implementation and disseminate information on air quality to public, according to officials.So far, Rs 375.44 crore have been released to 114 cities during FY 2019-20 & 2020-21 for initiating actions under city action plan.Further, Rs 4400 core have been released to 42 cities with million plus population as per recommendations of 15th Finance Commission report for FY 2020-21. This is in addition to funds available through various central and state government schemes, they added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/holistic-improvement-in-air-quality-one-of-governments-top-priority-says-environment-minister-307968

Also to extort money by putting into (them) fear of dire consequences,"  said the chargesheet.A fake post on social media platform Telegram, purportedly in the name of "Jaish Ul Hind", was a "deliberate attempt"  by Vaze to add credibility to "terror act", it said."The wording on the threat note 'agle baar connect hokar aega' (next time the bomb will have wires connected) clearly depicts the intention of Vaze for furtherance (of) acts to re-establish himself as a supercop by staging a fake encounter as to regain his lost glory," the charge-sheet said.Vaze, who himself handled the case initially, manipulated the probe to cover up the conspiracy, it said. Hiran, who had claimed that the SUV had been stolen from his possession, was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5.The NIA claimed that Vaze played a pivotal role in his murder.It was he who directed Hiran to lodge an FIR about vehicle theft when Vaze himself had used the SUV for the commission of the crime (to park it near Antilia), it alleged.Vaze tried to persuade Hiran to take responsibility for the act, but the latter refused, the NIA alleged.He then hatched the conspiracy to kill  Hiran through Sharma and another  former police officer Sunil Mane with the help of hired killers, the chargesheet said.Also, Vaze thought of Hiran as a "weak link" in the conspiracy who could expose others so he decided to kill the Thane businessman, the agency alleged.After Hiran's death, Vaze tried to make it look like a case of suicide by spreading such reports through his media contacts, the NIA said.Sharma, a retired police officer, "willingly and intentionally" entered into the conspiracy for the execution of Hiran's murder, the chargesheet alleged.Other arrested accused in the case are Vinayak Shinde, Naresh Gor, Riyazuddin Kazi, Sunil Mane, Anand Jadhav, Satish Mothkuri, Manish Soni, and Santosh Shelar. Shinde, Kazi, and Mane are former police officers.All the accused are booked for murder, conspiracy and kidnapping under the IPC as well as provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Explosive Substances Act; and Arms Act. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/antilia-bomb-scare-vaze-wanted-to-regain-glory-as-supercop-says-chargesheet-307963
07-09-2021||New Delhi||Central Vista project: CPWD proposal for diversion of deemed forest land gets ‘in-principle’ nod; 1,734 trees to be transplanted||The Environment Ministry’s Regional Empowered Committee (REC) has “in-principle” approved a proposal for diversion of 8.11 hectares of “deemed forest” land, where the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) stood, for the construction of three office buildings under the Central Vista redevelopment project.The final approval for diversion of forest land is to be granted by the central government.In August, the Delhi government had recommended the proposal for approval of the REC “in larger public interest subject to the conditions laid by the forest department”.There are more than 250 trees per hectare at the site. Therefore, it was treated as “deemed forest” and required approval for diversion for non-forest activity under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, a Delhi forest department official said.Of the existing 2,219 trees at the site, the Central Public Works Department seeks to transplant 1,734 and retain 485 trees.The three office buildings, which will be part of the Common Central Secretariat, are to be built at a cost of Rs 3,269 crore, with Rs 139 crore set aside for five years’ maintenance.The REC approved the CPWD’s proposal in a meeting held on August 24 subject to certain conditions.It said the land for compensatory afforestation should be made available to the Delhi Forest Department, free of all the encroachments and encumbrances, within 15 days of the approval and compliance submitted to Integrated Region Office, Jaipur.“Translocation scheme needs to be submitted before IRO, Jaipur as per species and age classes suitable for translocation. Forest land will be handed over only after required non-forest land for the project is handed over by the user agency,” the minutes of the meeting read.The CPWD has informed the Delhi Forest department that it will transplant 1,500 trees at NTPC Eco Park, Badarpur. The location for the remaining trees is being finalised.According to the agency, there are 1,179 trees, including the 485 retained ones, in the proposed “landscape plan” of the project. The CPWD has proposed 8.11 hectares of land near Dhulsiras village in Sector 29, Dwarka for compensatory afforestation.During an inspection conducted in July, the forest department found the land suitable for CA, according to documents seen by PTI.However, compensatory afforestation can only be done after pruning of “invasive species of trees on 20 per cent of the proposed land”, the forest department has told the CPWD.The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 requires that afforestation is carried out in compensation for forest land diverted for non-forestry uses.Compensatory afforestation can be done over an equivalent area of non-forest land or over degraded forest twice in extent of the area being diverted, if non-forest land is not available. According to the ministry’s guidelines, at least 1,000 saplings per hectare have to be planted on the identified non-forest land.”“Therefore, 8,110 saplings will be planted at the site in Dwarka,” a forest department official said.The CPWD will be allowed to start work at the IGNCA site only after it deposits Rs 7.07 crore and hand over the required non-forest land to the forest department for plantation work, he said.According to the CPWD, Central Vista houses only 22 of the 51 ministries of the central government. In some cases, a ministry has offices split between different buildings. This scattering of ministry offices across Delhi hampers the efficiency of administration and increases operation costs and energy usage.The consolidated Common Central Secretariat will have modern offices and facilities for all 51 ministries, it said.

The BKS has given the Narendra Modi Government 10 days to decide on the issue after which announce the next step, said general secretary Badri Narayan ChaudharyThis includes “pushing a private member bill through the Parliament”.Chaudhary said unlike the ongoing farmers’ agitation headed by the SKM, their demands were focused on getting a profitable support price for farmers, especially for the small and medium ones. “A law on MSP is their (SKM/farmers' unions) secondary demand---for us, it is the primary issue. The current MSP is not sufficient, it is a ‘chhalava’ (illusion). Moreover, it only benefits nine per cent of farmers of the country in two-three states,” Chaudhary said.“We support the three central farm laws because they are in favour of farmers. They should be implemented as fast as possible after some amendments that we have suggested”. Regarding the ongoing farmers’ agitation, the Sangh leader said: “Farming cannot be the prime responsibility of those sitting at borders for nine months. Either they are very rich farmers or they are not farmers”.On assertions that the Narendra Modi government implemented the Swaminathan Commission recommendation of MSP at 1.5 times the cost of production, Chaudhary said a proper committee should be constituted to look into all aspects. “Farmers cannot be treated like unskilled labour,  they are businessmen who take loans to run their business, they are entrepreneurs and also management persons and should be treated like them.“The fact is, by declaring MSP of some crops the government cannot shy away from its responsibility. Not only MSP, there should also be arrangements for their proper purchase which is only possible under a stringent law for a profitable price depending on the cost of production,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sangh-affiliate-bks-demands-law-on-msp-for-better-support-price-to-launch-countrywide-agitation-tomorrow-307958

Kalaskar could not be present virtually due to technical reasons, prosecution sources said.When the judge asked the accused if they pleaded guilty to the charges, Tawde sought time saying he wanted to meet his family members and lawyers in person.Andure also sought more time.The judge said there was no need to grant time for merely pleading guilty or not guilty.As the accused insisted, the court passed the order to frame charges while deferring the proceedings to September 15, but made it clear that there would be no further postponement.CBI lawyer and special prosecutor Prakash Suryawvashi said the central agency had proposed the same charges against Punalekar as those against others, but the court in its order only mentioned section 201 of IPC in his case.“We will not challenge the order. I will convey the order to the CBI,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dabholkar-murder-case-charges-to-be-framed-next-week-307956

She also promised a large share of tickets in the polls to Brahmins.The BSP chief supported the farmers’ protests against the farm laws and announced that if her party came to power, the three controversial legislations would not be implemented in the state.

It took 19 more days to go past the 60-crore mark and took only 13 days to reach 70 crore from 60 crore, the fastest so far, he said on Twitter.The countrywide vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16 with healthcare workers (HCWs) getting inoculated in the first phase.

07-09-2021||Pune||ED’s actions against Maharashtra leaders bid to subdue state government: Sharad Pawar||NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday claimed the Enforcement Directorate’s actions against various Maharashtra leaders were an attempt to encroach on the state government’s rights and discourage political opponents.Notably, the ED is conducting a probe into separate money laundering cases against NCP leaders Anil Deshmukh—a former state home minister—and Eknath Khadse. The central agency last week also conducted raids at multiple premises in Maharashtra linked to Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawali in connection with a money laundering case.The NCP shares power with the Shiv Sena and Congress in Maharashtra.Talking to reporters here, Pawar said, “Never heard of so many ED’s actions in Maharashtra in the past. One action is going on against Khadse, another against Anil Deshmukh, also against Bhawna Gawali. There is an attempt to encroach upon the state government’s rights case and discourage the opponents by using these agencies as tools”. To a question on the ED’s raids at premises linked to Bhavana Gawali, Pawar said the issue is about educational institutions.“When there are allegations against these kinds of institutions, the complaints can be lodged before the charity commissioner. If not the charity commissioner, then there are state government agencies, but here directly the ED was involved,” the former Union minister said.Asked about the possibility of a third Covid-19 wave, Pawar said: “I have seen many events happening where the (Covid-19 prevention) protocols are not being followed”. Pawar said since Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has asked political parties to immediately stop agitations, meetings and other events to avoid crowding, he will not attend programmes involving large gatherings . “I will only attend programmes organised indoors with a limited number of people,” he said.To a question on Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat’s comments that Hindus and Muslims share the same ancestry, Pawar quipped: “This is an addition to my knowledge”. Pawar also expressed reservations over the Reserve Bank of India’s interference into the cooperative sector.“The cooperative lenders spread the banking sector to the grass-root level. These banks help many people in case of financial needs. The merger and closure of cooperative banks is not only harmful to the cooperative sector, but also for the common people who have been benefiting from it,” he said.While earlier there was greater autonomy to select a cooperative bank’s chairman, now these institutions will have to go to the RBI for it.Pawar said: “This has weakened the cooperative sector”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eds-actions-against-maharashtra-leaders-bid-to-subdue-state-government-sharad-pawar-307942
07-09-2021||New Delhi||Academicians, writers ask DU to reinstate texts by Mahasweta Devi, Bama & Sukirtharani in syllabus||Over 1,100 academicians, writers and civil society members have written to Delhi University’s acting vice-chancellor, urging him to reinstate the works of Mahasweta Devi, Bama, and Sukirtharani in the English (Honours) syllabus.The petition came a few days after the teachers of English in the university made the same plea and accused the Oversight Committee of making a “complete mockery of all democratic and due processes” while drafting the syllabus.The petition has been signed by the likes of writers Arundhati Roy and Vikram Chandra, actors Sharmila Tagore and Shabana Azmi, filmmaker and writer Adoor Gopalakrishnan and filmmaker Anand Patwardhan.“The exclusion of Bama and Sukirtharani is a blatantly casteist act as it discriminates against contemporary Dalit women authors in a core paper on women’s writing, Surely, to delete, without any justification, two living Dalit women authors is a rare example of political disregard, omission and marginalisation of existing living writings...“Both Bama and Sukirtharani are contemporary Tamil writers, is it not important to teach and know, in a central university located in Delhi, the regional diversity of India,” the petition questioned.Mahashweta Devi’s short story Draupadi, which has been dropped from the syllabus, revolves around a Dalit woman who is picked up by the police on the accusation of being a Naxal and is then raped.“The charges against Mahasweta Devi’s ‘Draupadi’ are based on an inadequate understanding or deliberate misreading of the nationally and internationally acclaimed author. Rape of women is a heinous reality. Many literary texts draw attention to it and some English, European and American narratives of rape are included in the syllabus. Are we to turn a blind eye to its empathetic articulation by Indian authors,” it said.The university, in a statement on August 26, had said that a careful perusal of the present syllabus brings out the “inclusive nature of the syllabus” under reference in terms of its diversity of content and inclusion of pioneering works of renowned scholars of both national and international fame, without consideration of their religion, caste and creed.“The university subscribes to the idea that the literary content forming part of the text in a language course of study should contain materials which do not hurt the sentiments of any individual and are inclusive in nature to portray a true picture of our society, both past and present,” the statement read.Stating that three contemporary women authors can be dropped “so easily” from a core paper on women’s writing was a sign of deep worry, the letter demanded the reinstatement of the dropped texts.“The reasons given and not given for the deletions are prejudicial and misogynistic in intent as no sound academic reasons have been provided,” they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/academicians-writers-ask-du-to-reinstate-texts-by-mahasweta-devi-bama-sukirtharani-in-syllabus-307938

07-09-2021||New Delhi||46 pc rise in complaints of crimes against women in 2021 so far: NCW||There was a 46 per cent rise in complaints of crimes against women in the first eight months of 2021 over the corresponding period of last year, and over half of these were from Uttar Pradesh, the National Commission for Women (NCW) said.NCW chief Rekha Sharma said there has been a rise in the complaints because the commission has been regularly conducting awareness programs due to which the public is now more aware about its work.The NCW received a total of 19,953 complaints of crimes against women from January to August this year, up from 13,618 in the corresponding period of 2020, it said.In July, as many as 3,248 complaints were received by the NCW which is the highest in a month since June 2015, it added.Of the 19,953 complaints, the highest number of 7,036 were recorded under the right to live with dignity clause, followed by 4,289 complaints of domestic violence and 2,923 complaints of harassment of married women or dowry harassment, the NCW said.The right to live with dignity clause takes into account the emotional abuse of women.As many as 1,116 complaints have been received regarding the offence of outraging modesty of women or molestation, followed by 1,022 complaints of rape and attempt to rape and 585 complaints of cyber crimes.Among states and union territories, the highest number of complaints was received from Uttar Pradesh (10,084), followed by Delhi (2,147), Haryana (995) and Maharashtra (974), the commission said.NCW chief Sharma said the rise in the number of complaints is because of increased awareness among women to report crimes.“Also, the commission has always made it a point to launch new initiatives to help women. Keeping in line with this, we have launched a round-the-clock helpline number as well to provide support services to women in need where they can also register a complaint,” Sharma told PTI.Akansha Srivastava, founder of the Akanksha Foundation which works for education and empowerment of people by imparting knowledge on cyber safety, said the rise in complaints is due to more awareness among women to reach out for help.“When complaints rise it is a good thing because it means more women have the courage to speak up and there are platforms in place now and they are aware of where to report. People are reaching out now. Earlier women might not be coming forward to lodge their complaint...they didn’t know what they are going through is harassment but now they do, and they are coming forward to report which is a good thing,” she said.

Manaslu, the world's eighth tallest peak at 8,163 metres, while a three-member team was greenlighted for the world's third-highest Mt. Kanchenjunga."So many mountaineers receiving climbing permits for the autumn season suggest that there is a massive lure of Nepal's Himalayan mountains among the climbers despite the risk of being infected with the coronavirus," Bhisma Raj Bhattarai, section officer at the department, told Xinhua news agency."A significant number of mountaineers are arriving in Nepal to climb the mountains here, even though Nepal has not been issuing on-arrival visas for foreign tourists since the second wave of Covid-19 hit the country in April," added the officer.In spring this year, reports about the spread of the coronavirus among mountaineers attempting Himalayan mountains inside Nepal had made international headlines, yet a total of 633 climbers and their supporting staff scaled six mountains, including Mt. Everest, the world's tallest at 8848.86 metres, according to the department.Bhattarai said most climbers were preparing to climb Mt. Manaslu in the fall season that began this month because the season is suitable to summit the peak.Himalaya Vision Treks & Expedition Pvt. Ltd, a Nepali company, is organising an expedition of Mt. Manaslu for a group of mountaineers."We're organising the expedition for ten climbers, all from Europe, after they received climbing permits," Subash Kumar Shrestha, director of the company, told Xinhua."Many mountaineers visited Nepal to climb the mountains in the spring this year even when Nepal was witnessing a massive spread of the coronavirus," he said."They are now coming to Nepal without fear as they have been vaccinated against Covid-19." As per rules set by the Nepali government, unvaccinated foreign tourists should have quarantined for 10 days and taken a mandatory Covid-19 PCR test."In the case of fully vaccinated foreign tourists, it will be enough that they undertake a PCR test," said Bhattarai.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/160-climbers-granted-permits-to-summit-2-peaks-inside-nepal-307920

He also said he was safe, but gave no details on his whereabouts.Two Resistance front leaders deadNational Resistance Front media face Fahim Dashti (above) and prominent commander Gen Abdul Wudod Zara (right) were killed on Sunday night allegedly by a Pakistani drone.China mum on Taliban ‘invite’The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday did not respond to a report claiming that the Taliban had invited China to attend the new government formation ceremony in Afghanistan.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah and NSA Ajit Doval, who constitute a high-level group on Afghanistan along with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who was not in town, had first met six days back in a meeting chaired by the PM.At a press conference to announce the “defeat” of the Panjshir rebels, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid again promised an inclusive government which would not depend on any outside force, including Pakistan. But NRF leader Ahmad Massoud, in an audio message, alleged that it was Pakistan’s ISI spy agency which had assisted and egged on the Taliban to fight against the Panjshiris. This was an echo of 1996 when the ISI had allegedly instructed the Mujahideen to kill former Afghan President Mohd Najibullah, who was then dragged out of a UN compound and hanged to death.However, both Massoud and Amrullah Saleh had melted in the rugged mountainside but the NRF’s media face Fahim Dashti and a prominent commander Gen Abdul Wudod Zara were killed on Sunday night allegedly by a Pakistani drone. In this context, Iran “strongly warned” the Taliban against crossing the “red lines” and said its Foreign Office was examining the possibility of “foreign intervention” in Panjshir attacks after the audio message by Massoud.The Iranian Foreign Office said the “martyrdom” of Panjshir commanders was “utterly disappointing” and noted that the Taliban offensive took place even after Massoud had supported a plan, put forward by religious clerics, for a negotiated settlement.The meeting chaired by PM Modi took note of the presence of the ISI chief in Afghanistan amid government formation talks by the Taliban with reports suggesting differences between the Taliban and Haqqani network on the name of Haibatullah Akhundzada as the supreme leader. The meeting also deliberated on the measures to be taken for full and safe evacuation of Indian nationals from Afghanistan and the minorities who might want to come.Evacuations from Afghanistan were suspended on August 31. Many people are still hoping to leave the country, but with Kabul’s airport not yet running international flights, their choices are few. The Taliban have reportedly said they were working to repair Kabul airport.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-chairs-high-level-meet-as-taliban-enter-panjshir-ahmad-massoud-blames-pakistan-for-killings-307742

Supreme Court Bench"We don't want confrontation with the government… we are happy with the way the nine Supreme Court judges were appointed... But what about these tribunals," a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta. The government didn't want any confrontation either, Mehta said.The Bench asked the Centre to apprise it of alternative proposals, if any, and whether it wanted the tribunals to continue."You (government) are emasculating the tribunals by not making the appointments," said the Bench, which also included Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice LN Rao."There is no respect for the judgments of this court. This is what we are feeling. You are testing our patience. Last time, you made a statement that some persons have been appointed. Where are they appointed," the Bench said."It seems you are bent upon not respecting the judgment of the court... We have only three options left, one is staying the legislation… and directing you to go ahead with the appointments, or close down these tribunals and give the powers to high courts to take up these matters, and third is we ourselves will appoint the people. We may consider initiating contempt proceedings,” the CJI said.The SC also took exception to the new memorandum of procedure that said the shortlisted names would be recommended only after getting clearance from the Intelligence Bureau. Noting that tribunals were critical to the economy, the Bench asked the Centre to make some appointments to tribunals before Monday, the next date of hearing.Mehta said the government would ensure that in the next two weeks decisions were taken as regards appointments to tribunals where the search and selection committee had already recommended names.The court issued notices on petitions filed by senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh and others challenging the validity of various provisions of the Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021, passed during Parliament’s monsoon session that reduced the tenure of chairmen and members of various tribunals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-crippling-tribunals-says-sc-307744

At the last round on July 31, conducted on the Chinese side of Chushul-Moldo meeting point, it was decided that further discussions would be needed on Hot Springs as the LAC claims of both sides “differed and overlapped”.The disengagement from Gogra was officially completed on August 5 and it was announced in a statement by the Ministry of Defence on August 6. As per the agreement, both sides ceased forward deployments in Gogra area in a phased, coordinated and verified manner. The troops of both sides are now in their respective permanent bases. All temporary structures and other allied infrastructure created in the area by both sides is learnt to have been dismantled and mutually verified. The landform in the area had been restored to pre-standoff period, it is learnt.The 832-km LAC in Ladakh is undefined on the ground and both sides have claims and counterclaims. Currently, tanks, guns, missile launchers and troops are lined up within striking distance of each other on the Ladakh plateau, which is at an altitude of 14,000 ft.In the past, China had gone back on agreements it has made since the military standoff started in May 2020, thus no official announcement had so far been made on the pullback, said sources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-gear-up-to-discuss-hot-springs-307751

The country had seen 199 daily deaths on March 23.Eleven contacts of the boy who died have shown symptoms and 251 contacts traced, 129 of them health workers.Meanwhile, states and UTs sent 16,055 RTPCR-positive Covid-19 samples for whole genome sequencing to the apex lab network under the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium in July and August, the government said today.These numbers are, however, less than the 16,681 samples sequenced in April. The Health Ministry attributed the decline in numbers to localisation of the disease and the growing number of districts with zero cases. As of today, 86 districts had zero new Covid-19 cases in a week with INSACOG focusing sharply on Kerala and Maharashtra, contributing 80 per cent of the new national infections. INSACOG sequenced 16,681 samples in April, 14,112 in May and 11,624 in June. In July, 9,066 samples were sent through sentinel sites, while the number was 6,969 in August.The samples with variants of concern (VOC) received by the National Centre for Disease Control from INSACOG labs also fluctuated. The number was 2,207 in January, 1,321 in February, 7,806 in March, 5,713 in April, 10,488 in May, 12,257 in June, 6,990 in July and 6,458 in August.The ministry said daily positivity rate had remained below 3 per cent for seven days and below 5 per cent for 91 days, causing samples for sequencing to decline.“With the decrease in positivity, the samples’ availability from the sentinel sites catering to districts with zero or single-digit weekly new cases has gone down,” the ministry said.India shifted its sequencing strategy after January. The initial sequencing was aimed at detecting variants of concern (VOC) among incoming international travellers.For this, 5 per cent of positive samples were sequenced. The stated objective was achieved by January-end. Gradually sentinel sites were set up across states to send samples to ensure proper representation of all districts. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/3-kerala-districts-on-nipah-alert-genome-sequencing-on-307754

07-09-2021||New Delhi||Centre issues SOPs for police officers to seek prior approval before probing corrupt public servants||The Centre has issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) for police officers to seek mandatory prior approval before conducting any investigation against allegedly corrupt public servants, according to a Personnel Ministry order.An amendment carried out in the over 30-year-old Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, 1988 in July 2018 bars a police officer from conducting “any enquiry or inquiry or investigation into any offence alleged to have been committed by a public servant” without “the previous approval” of the authorities.The SOPs were issued “to standardise and operationalise procedures with a view to achieving uniform and effective implementation for prior approval processes”, more than three years after the amendments came into force.They provide for stage-wise processing of information received by a police officer, specify the rank of the police officer to seek prior approval and lay down a single-window procedure for it among others, said the order issued to secretaries of the central and state government departments.All administrative authorities, including ministries and departments of the central and the state governments, besides the investigating agencies, have been asked to ensure “strict compliance” of the SOPs, it said.The SOPs have been shared with the director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) “with the request that all field units may kindly be apprised of these SOPs for strict compliance”, and also with the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC).The SOPs make it mandatory for a police officer to verify whether the information received by him pertains to the allegation of the commission of an offence by a public servant or whether it contains information to identify the public servant(s) against whom the offence has been alleged.It also makes it mandatory for them to specify act(s) of commission or omission attributable to such public servant(s) and “whether such act(s) are relatable to the official function or duty discharged by such public servant(s) specific to the office/post held at the time of commission of the alleged offence”.“The police officer in receipt of an information shall place the matter before the police officer of appropriate rank for seeking previous approval,” it said.The SOPs have specified the police officer of appropriate rank who shall make a proposal to the appropriate government/authority in respect of a person who is or has been a public servant, said the order.The police officer of appropriate rank shall decide upon whether the information received merits to be “enquired” or inquired into or investigated, it said.Enquiry for the purposes of these SOPs means any action taken for verifying as to whether the information pertains to the commission of an offence, the order clarified.A director general (DG) or DG-equivalent police officer has been specified in the SOPs to seek prior approvals for Union ministers, Members of Parliament, ministers of state governments, members of state legislature, judge of the Supreme Court and high court, and chairpersons or managing directors of public sector enterprises (both central and state) and public sector banks (board-level).The Personnel Ministry has also shared a checklist for police officers for processing cases of prior approvals, said the ministry’s order.The police officer will have to enclose a copy of the complaint if the request seeking approval against an allegedly corrupt officer is based on it.They would also have to enclose an authenticated translation in case the original complaint has been made in a vernacular language, it said.They will have to furnish details whether the complaint prima facie reveals deriving of an undue advantage by a public servant for self or any other person, information in respect of bribe giver and “details of the recommendation made or decision taken by a public servant, which is relatable to the offence alleged against the public servant”, according to the order.The government authorities have been asked to “designate an officer” “not below the rank of an under-secretary for receiving the proposals relating to previous approval”, it said.“The appropriate government or the authority, as the case may be, shall examine the proposal, by independent application of mind and take an appropriate decision under section 17A of the Act, for being conveyed to the police officer of appropriate rank,” the order said.

For one per cent candidates, the entire system cannot be put on hold," the bench, also comprising Justices Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar, told advocate Shoeb Alam who was appearing for the petitioners.When Alam said that around 25,000 students would be appearing in either improvement or supplementary examinations for Class 12, the bench observed that only around one per cent candidates go for that.Alam argued that medical entrance exam NEET-UG 2021 be deferred as many other examinations are scheduled around September 12."If you are to appear in multiple examinations, then you need to make choice," the bench said, adding, "You have to prioritise. You must also be conscious that any deferment is likely to clash with some other examination."The bench said the respective boards would do their job and the court would not interfere with examinations in such a situation.It said deferment of exams might affect the next course and whole thing would be prolonged."It will be very unfair to reschedule the examination. NEET is a very large examination. It is not state-wise, it is a nation-wide exam," the bench said.Alam told the court that around 16 lakh candidates are likely to appear in the NEET exam.

The petition specifically challenges Sections 3(1), 3(7), 5 and 7(1) of the Act."It is clear that you don't want to respect the judgments of this court. Now we have the option to stay the Tribunal Reforms Act or close down tribunals or we ourselves appoint the people, or the next option is initiate contempt of courts act. These are three options," the Bench said posting it for further hearing on Monday.The CJI, however, said, "We don't want confrontation with the government and we are happy with the way Supreme Court judges were appointed. These tribunals are collapsing with no members or chairperson.""You are emasculating tribunals by not filling vacancies," Justice LN Rao commented.Describing NCLT and NCLAT as cornerstones of lots of decisions taken by the government with regard to the economy and very important for rehabilitation of corporate entities, Justice DY Chandrachud said, "Important cases are not being heard because of vacancies.

Some surveys estimate a higher quantity, but according to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, on an average, more than 500 MT (million tonnes) of CR is generated every year — from rice (122 MT), wheat (100 MT), maize (71 MT), millets (26 MT), sugarcane (141 MT), fibre crops (8 MT) and pulses (28 MT). Uttar Pradesh (60 MT), Punjab (51 MT) and Maharashtra (46 MT) are major CR-generating states. Out of 140 MT surplus CR, 92 MT (18%) is burnt, whereas the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that it is over 25% of the total CR which is burnt in India, most of which is in UP, Punjab, Maharashtra and Haryana. With machine harvesting, a large quantity of CR is left in the field, the clearing of which becomes a labour-intensive operation, needed to be completed within a short time frame between the harvesting of the ripened crop and the sowing of the next crop. The problem has become more severe after the promulgation of the Preservation of Subsoil Water Acts by Punjab and Haryana governments in 2009, prohibiting the transplanting of rice seedlings before June 10, squeezing the time period to about three weeks only to complete rice harvesting, managing a huge quantity of leftover straw in the field and the sowing of wheat.As estimated by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), about 57.7 MT of surplus CR is expected to be utilised under ex situ management options under various government policies. The Punjab Government’s policy on renewable sources of energy, formulated in 2012, was set to achieve a capacity target of 600 MW from biomass and 500 MW from cogeneration (both bagasse and non-bagasse) within 10 years. However, only seven power projects have been commissioned so far with far less use of paddy straw as well as power generation. The Haryana government’s bio-energy policy, brought out in 2018, planned to achieve a target of 150 MW biomass-based power generation within four years; it, too, is far away from achieving its target.Besides energy generation, there is a need to accelerate the implementation of other measures like in situ management, biochar making, composting, addressing limitations of assured market of the end products and reducing additional cost incurred on logistics and transportation of material to longer distances. The procedures for carrying out in situ CR management need special machinery and equipment which is normally beyond the capacity to procure as well as short of full utility for the farmers with small holdings. Despite hefty subsidies, the main concern of the farmers is investment on such machines that can be used only once during the season rather than the others required to be used round the year. Hence, the availability of this machinery and equipment through cooperatives, farmer producer companies, groups of farmers, village panchayats by subletting/renting at affordable rates, can be a game-changer to address the burning issue of CR management. The development of low-cost, affordable machinery is the need of the hour.In March 2018, the Cabinet Committee for Economic Affairs approved Rs 1,151.80 crore for the ‘promotion of agricultural mechanisation for in situ management of CR in states falling in the Indo-Gangetic Plain and Rajasthan’ to sensitise farmers with different variants of required farm machineries. However, during the same year, of the total paddy straw residue, about 17% in Haryana and 50% in Punjab was burnt, indicating low implementation of the scheme. Turbo happy seeder and harvester combine fitted with super straw management system are the primary machines for in situ management of paddy straw residue. As per studies, including one by the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the available machines are not sufficient to manage the existing CR within the limited intervening time between paddy harvesting and the sowing of wheat.The interventions for successful management of CR and eliminating its burning are largely disintegrated. Under such a situation, reportedly even machinery worth Rs 650 crore could not douse farm fires in Punjab in 2019, according to a news report, and 76,626 machines given to Punjab by the Centre over three years have not produced the desired results. In the small-scale Indian farming system, the resource-poor farmers individually lack capacity and means; they should be supported in establishing an organised network, associations and community organisations for establishing services to manage CR. Offering services like collecting and transferring CR from the fields to the places of its utilisation as raw material and renting the machinery and equipment by government agencies should be centric to such arrangements operating at the doorstep of the framers. There should be an enabling system for efficient and effective CR collection, aggregation and viable models for the CR supply chain for the establishments involved in CR valorisation.The new law passed by Parliament in the recent monsoon session says that the Commission on Air Quality Management “may impose and collect environmental compensation from farmers causing air pollution by stubble burning.” However, penalising CR burning is an erroneous application of the ‘polluter pays’ notion because this pollution is not the outcome of any industrial or business venture. It’s better to dispense with it, considering the complexities of the problems and compulsions of the farmers who go for it. It is important to extend a helping hand and run awareness campaigns for technical and economical empowerment of people involved in farming activities.More importantly, CR management must not be viewed as an issue under the domain of the agriculture sector only but related to other sectors as well, hence requiring integrated approaches for devising and implementing practical solutions. Considering crop residue as a commodity and a useful asset, instead of waste, will result in its successful and beneficial management. However, due to its large volume, the capacities to manage it need to be scaled up.The author is ex-VC, Maharana Pratap University of Agriculture and Technology, UdaipurSend your feedback to letters@tribunemail.com||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/empower-incentivise-farmers-to-curb-farm-fires-307378
