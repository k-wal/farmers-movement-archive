The detailed order became available on Friday.The ACB, which probed the case, had alleged that Bhujbal and his family members received kickbacks from the construction firm K S Chamankar Enterprises which got the contract to build the new guest house of the state government in the national capital.Chamankar Enterprises transferred money to Niche Infrastructure and other companies in which Pankaj and Sameer Bhujbal were directors, the ACB had alleged.Special Judge H S Sathbhai held that evidence indicated that no illegality was committed in awarding  the contract to Chamankar Enterprises and no illegal gratification/ kickback/quid pro quo was given by the developer to Chhagan Bhujbal.The contract had been given by the state government in 2005-2006 when the NCP leader was PWD minister."The material on record is not satisfactory and substantial to even suggest that Chhagan Bhujbal got any illegal gratification in any kind directly or indirectly," the court added.The ACB had alleged that the contractor "earned 80 per cent profit" in the construction against the government norm which allowed only 20 per cent margin. The Bhujbals got Rs 13.5 crore in kickbacks from the firm which earned a profit of about Rs 190 crore, the state agency had alleged.But the court said there was no evidence to show that an amount of Rs 13.5 crore was transferred by Chamankar Enterprises to any other firm for passing it on to the Bhujbals.

I was never able to follow up,” he said.He said that the next morning, the press told him that there were five Bidens living in India.Elaborating more on this, Biden jokingly said, “There was a Captain George Biden in the East India tea company. That is hard for an Irish person to admit. I shouldn’t be so casual. I hope you are able to understand the humour. The end result was that he apparently stayed and married an Indian woman.”    “I have never been able to track it down so the whole purpose of this meeting is to help me figure it out,” Biden said, triggering laughter among those present in the meeting room, including Prime Minister Modi. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biden-jokes-about-possible-india-connection-in-meeting-with-prime-minister-modi-315665

Trivedi noted that Modi will be meeting the third US President as the Indian PM and asserted that he has enjoyed same strong relations with every President and the government there, irrespective of the party in power.The PM has been projecting India’s interests with the same intensity, Trivedi said while speaking about the PM’s meeting with US Vice President Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden and the first-in-person Quad leaders’ summit.Chauthaiwale said the two countries are not only strategic partners but also share commonalities and are in sync over global issues, including terrorism and security issues. The five CEOs the PM met represented top US firms from different sectors and were carefully chosen for the meeting, he said, adding that they expressed confidence in the Indian economy and promised more investment.The PM’s meetings with CEOs of Adobe, Qualcomm, First Solar, General Atomics and Blackstone Group on issues ranging from drones to 5G, semiconductor and solar will yield vast opportunities for India, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indo-us-relations-have-grown-from-strength-to-strength-under-pm-modi-bjp-315650
24-09-2021||New Delhi||Children less severely impacted by Covid-19 pandemic: WHO chief scientist||Children have been less severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and their chances of recovery are very well, World Health Organisation (WHO) chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Friday.She, however, said SARS-CoV2 virus may not disappear, but it is not going to cause the kind of impact and panic it caused over the last two years.Participating in a virtual session on ‘Priorities after Pandemic; What Young India wants?’- Indian Student Parliament, Swaminathan said the reason why people talk about children being susceptible is because vaccination programmes today in most countries are targeting people above the age of 18 and elderly as they are the most vulnerable.“When you do that, you are left with younger, and younger people who are unvaccinated. And, therefore, when you have the virus circulating in the community, those people are basically the susceptible population,” she said in response to a question.In many countries, it is seen that by vaccinating older people, the infection pattern shifts to younger people.“I want to assure you that children on the whole have been less severely impacted by this pandemic. Not that they don’t get infected. Yes, they do get infected as adults but they don’t get severely ill. Clearly, it is an age-related correlation with the severity,” she said. “Even if they get infected, the chances are that they recover very well,” the WHO chief scientist said.On inoculation of children against the virus in India, she said there will be vaccines for children. The drug regulator has given a nod to Zydus Cadila for administering to adolescents over 12 years, besides the age group of 18 years and above.The phase 2/3 clinical trial data of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin in the age group two to 18 years is underway.The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) in July granted permission to Serum Institute of India (SII) for conducting phase 2/3 trials of Covid-19 vaccine Covovax on children aged two to 17 years with certain conditions.Swaminathan added that many countries have third, fourth and fifth waves and hoped that India will not have a third wave.Commenting on how the pandemic could shape, she said Covid-19 is going to become the next respiratory virus.Stressing that vaccines are working very well and give a good deal of protection, she said wearing a mask, avoiding crowds and mass gatherings, being in a well-ventilated place and respiratory hygiene are some of the measures that can keep the spread of the virus under control.“The virus may not disappear. But it is not going to cause the kind of impact, the kind of panic caused over the last two years. Some of these precautions will become part of our life,” she said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/children-less-severely-impacted-by-covid-19-pandemic-who-chief-scientist-315649

24-09-2021||Vijay Mohan||Indian scientists develop cost-effective device to rapidly detect explosives||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 24Indian scientists have developed a thermally stable and cost-effective electronic polymer-based sensor for rapidly detecting nitro-aromatic chemicals used in high-energy explosives.The detection of explosives without destroying them is essential for protection, and criminal investigations, minefield remediation, military applications, ammunition remediation sites, security applications. Chemical sensors play a vital role in such cases.Though explosive poly-nitroaromatic compounds can usually be analysed by sophisticated instrumental techniques, the requirement for quick decision-making in criminology laboratories, reclaimed military sites or to detect explosives in possession of extremists often require simple and cheap field techniques which are non-destructive in nature.Non-destructive sensing of nitroaromatic chemicals (NACs) is difficult. While earlier studies are based mostly on photo-luminescent property, detection of the basis of a material’s conducting property has not been explored so far. Detection on the basis of conducting property helps in making a handy detection device where results can be seen with the help of a LED.To overcome such disadvantages, a team of scientists led by Dr Neelotpal Sen Sarma from the Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology, an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology, has developed an electronic layer-by-layer (LBL) polymer detector consisting of two organic polymers, which undergoes a drastic change in impedance in the presence of very low concentration of NACs vapour within few seconds. “An electronic sensing device build around a polymer gas sensor can quickly detect the explosive on-site,” said Dr Sarma.The tri-layer polymer matrix was found to be very efficient molecular sensor for nitroaromatic chemicals. The sensor device is quite simple and reversible in nature and its response does not alter with varying operating temperature in presence of other common chemicals and humidity.The device can be operated at room temperature, has a low response time and negligible interference from other chemicals. The fabrication is a very simple, is negligibly affected by humidity, and the cholesterol-based polymers used are biodegradable.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-scientists-develop-cost-effective-device-to-rapidly-detect-explosives-315644

Consent of parents will be necessary if they want to attend,” the minister added.As per a survey conducted by the school education department, more than 70 per cent parents favoured reopening of schools, Gaikwad said.The state government in July this year had allowed schools to restart physical classes in the rural areas where Covid-19 prevalence was negligible. The decision mainly benefited Vidarbha region.But schools in major cities such as Mumbai and Pune remained closed.The latest decision was taken after consulting health officials as well as the state government’s Covid-19 task force, Gaikwad said.“The school education department has given the powers to implement the decision as per local conditions to district collectors. Every school will have to conduct a parent-teacher meeting and apprise parents about precautions as well as the immediate steps to be taken by the school administration,” she said.As to the residential schools run by the tribal development department, a separate decision will be taken by that ministry, Gaikwad said.Speaking to reporters in Pune, Minister for Higher and Technical Education Uday Samant said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has sought reports from vice chancellors of state universities about reopening, and colleges could resume in-person classes after Diwali. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/schools-to-reopen-in-entire-maharashtra-from-october-4-315643

Both were nabbed from Navi Mumbai on Thursday night, one of them from Rabale area. So far, 26 persons have been arrested and two minors detained. Search is on for remaining accused," a police official said. Based on the girl's complaint, the Manpada police in Dombivli on Wednesday registered a case against 33 persons under IPC sections 376 (rape), 376 (n) (repeated rape), 376 (d) (gang-rape), 376 (3) (rape on a woman under sixteen years of age) and provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.As per the girl's statement to police, she met main accused Vijay Phuke and Tushar Kasbe in December 2020 through a common friend, and Phuke began to chat with her on mobile phone.On January 29, Phuke called her to a spot in Dombivli East and took her in an auto rickshaw saying they were going to meet their common friend.But she was taken to some other place where four persons including Phuke gang raped her, she alleged. The accused blackmailed her by threatening to circulate her pictures and recorded a video of the sexual assault on their mobile phones, she said.In February, the girl's family shifted to another residence. On February 20, Phuke called and asked her to meet him. When she refused, he accosted her near her new house the next day, and threatened to show her video to her family members, she alleged.Scared, she agreed to go with him and was sexually assaulted by at least eight men this time, she told police.Similar incidents happened on March 22, May 5 and 16, July 28 and September 22, and sometimes she was given sedatives before she was raped, she claimed.On May 5, when she did not return home at night, her mother had even filed a missing person complaint, but the girl returned the next day and did not tell anything to her parents. In one instance, she saw Phuke and a co-accused taking Rs 1,000 from a friend after they forced her to have sex with him, she said.She finally mustered courage to speak to her mother about the ordeal on September 22 after which the offense was registered and probe began, the official added.

24-09-2021||New Delhi||NDA alliance takes shape in Uttar Pradesh; BJP, Nishad party and Apna Dal to contest upcoming Assembly polls||The contours of the BJP-led NDA alliance appear to be in place for the crucial elections to Uttar Pradesh, next year.The saffron party on Friday announced alliance with Sanjay Nishad-led Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (Nishad party), which represents communities like fishermen and boatmen whose traditional occupations are centred on rivers.  Making the announcement, UP election in-charge Dharmendra Pradhan said the BJP will contest the upcoming elections in alliance with the Nishad party and the Apna Dal, whose leader Anupriya Patel is also a minister of state in the Narendra Modi council in the Centre.Both Pradhan and state party chief Swatantra Dev Singh specified that the alliance will contest under the leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, thereby putting at rest all speculations regarding the “face” for the key fight.Exuding confidence of the “lotus blooming again” with more strength than 2017, Pradhan said due respect will be given to both the allies in the distribution of seats.“People have unwavering faith in PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath. Their trust is our biggest asset. We will win on the basis of the work of the government and strength of our organisation and cadres. The progress made by UP in past four and a half years is exemplary,” said Pradhan who is in UP for the ground work on the forthcoming polls.The BJP, which is holding detailed analysis of each and every sitting MLA, is expected to drop all those failing to make the cut. Sources say that it may drop as many as 50 per cent of the sitting MLAs to beat anti-incumbency and negative perceptions against the party.In the 2017 elections, the saffron party won 312 of 403 Assembly seats with close to 40 per cent vote share, restricting the Samajwadi Party to 47 seats, the BSP to 19 and the Congress to seven seats. This year the UP arena has another player, the Aam Aadmi Party. Recently its leader Sanjay Singh announced that AAP will field candidates in all 403 seats for the upcoming elections.In 2017, the Nishad party, which contested in alliance with other small groupings, had won just one constituency. In fact, its leader Sanjay Nishad came third in the Gorakhpur Rural seat. However, his son Praveen Nishad won the 2018 Lok Sabha by-poll from Gorakhpur as a joint Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party candidate. In 2019, Nishad allied with the BJP and Praveen Nishad was elected to Lok Sabha from Sant Kabir Nagar.Groupings like the Nishad party and the Apna Dal with specific caste bases are critical for the saffron party hoping to reclaim the state amid tough challenge from the SP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nda-alliance-takes-shape-in-uttar-pradesh-bjp-nishad-party-and-apna-dal-to-contest-upcoming-assembly-polls-315639

24-09-2021||New Delhi||SC stays Kerala HC proceedings on plea against EWS quota||The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the proceedings before the Kerala High Court on a petition challenging the Centre’s decision to grant 10 per cent quota in government jobs and admissions to educational institutions to candidates belonging to the economically weaker sections.Acting on the Centre’s plea seeking transfer of the case from the high court to the top court, a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana issued notice to Nujaim PK—the petitioner before the high court.The top court had in August last year referred petitions on the issue to a five-judge Constitution Bench. However, the EWS quota is already operational as there is no stay on it.Friday’s order came after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta sought stay on the proceedings before the high courtThe transfer of the aforesaid petition would enable all these cases to be clubbed and heard together and avoid possibility of inconsistent orders by different courts, it said, adding, the transfer of petition was necessary because certain petitions on the issue were already pending before the top court.There are around 20 petitions pending against the Constitution (103rd Amendment) Act, 2019 which paved the way for grant of reservation to EWS candidates of general category. The petitioners have sought quashing of the law on the ground that backwardness for the purpose of reservation cannot be defined by “economic status alone”.The law talks about a maximum of 10% of seats/posts in addition to the existing reservations for SCs, STs and OBCs, taking total reservation to 59%, much beyond the 50% ceiling fixed by the Supreme Court in the Indra Shawney case popularly known as Mandal Case. It also extends reservation to private aided and unaided educational institutions. The PILs – including those filed by Youth for Equality and Tehseen Poonawala – challenged its validity, contending it violated basic structure of the Constitution.The Centre has defended EWS quota, saying it intended to uplift around 200 million people who were below the poverty line even after over 70 years of Independence. Nobody can say such people should not be given a “helping hand” to uplift them, Attorney General KK Venugopal had submitted.Another Bench of the top court led by Justice DY Chandrachud set aside a Madras High Court direction that said reservation for EWS candidates in NEET All India Quota medical seats can be implemented only with the approval of the Supreme Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-stays-kerala-hc-proceedings-on-plea-against-ews-quota-315634

Soon after his release he had joined the ruling Trinamool Congress. He was, however, arrested by the NIA on March 26 this year, the day after polling was conducted in Jangalmahal.The chargesheet has been filed within 180 days of his arrest, the official added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-names-tmc-member-12-others-in-rajdhani-express-hostage-case-315617

Security has been tightened across the district with heavy deployment in Goroikhuti, Dholpur I and III villages in Sipajhar where the eviction drive was underway, he said.A Congress delegation, comprising its state chief Bhupen Bora, Rajya Sabha MP Ripun Bora, deputy leader of Congress Legislature Party (CLP) Rakibul Hussain and other senior leaders, staged a protest against the incident outside the Darrang deputy commissioner's office in district headquarters Mangaldoi.The delegation was also scheduled to submit a memorandum to Assam Governor Jagdish Mukhi through the deputy commissioner, party spokesperson Bobbeeta Sharma said.Director General of Police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta visited the district on Thursday night to review the law and order situation and announced that the state Criminal Investigation Department (CID) will probe the incident."Some facts have come to light while there are many that are yet to be unravelled. The CID will investigate all the aspects," he told reporters.2 killed in police firing during eviction drive in Assam’s Darrang, govt orders judicial probeThe DGP said that the photographer of the deputy commissioner's office who was seen in a viral video kicking and hitting a man allegedly shot dead by security personnel has been arrested and booked, and he was in the CID's custody.The state government has announced a judicial inquiry into the incident by a retired Gauhati High Court judge whose name is yet to be declared.Eleven seriously injured people, of whom three were policemen and the rest civilians, were shifted to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) late on Thursday night, its superintendent Abhijit Sharma said.A policeman and three civilians were stated to be critical, while the condition of the remaining people was stable although they were under observation, he said.BJP MLA Padma Hazarika, who is the in-charge of the government's community farming project to be taken up on the evicted land, said that the protestors had already dispersed after a positive discussion with the deputy commissioner who had assured them that their demands will be considered and they will be provided with an adequate rehabilitation package."After that who attacked the policemen and under the provocation of whom must be investigated. If vested parties think they can stop the eviction drive and the farming project, then they are mistaken. The project will be successfully completed," he said.Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had said on Thursday that the ongoing eviction drive will not be stopped and the police entrusted with the job of clearing the land of "illegal encroachers" will continue to do so till the job was done.The Darrang district administration has so far cleared 602.4 hectares of land and evicted 800 families since Monday and demolished four “illegally” constructed religious structures at Sipajhar.The chief minister had visited the area on June 7 and inspected the riverine areas allegedly encroached by ''illegal settlers'' near Dholpur Shiva temple and directed the district administration to clear the area for setting up the community farming project. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/12-hour-bandh-called-to-protest-eviction-drive-deaths-in-assams-darrang-315592
24-09-2021||Ballia (UP)||Muslims should bow to ‘Indian culture'; Ram, Krishna, Shiva were their ancestors: UP minister||Uttar Pradesh minister Anand Swaroop Shukla has said that lord Ram, Krishna, and Shiva were the ancestors of Indian Muslims and they should bow to the “land and culture of India”.In provocative remarks here, the minister of state for parliamentary affairs also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath have defeated the mindset which intended to create an Islamic State in the country by raising the flag of Hindutva and “Indian culture”.Opinions page: BJP on a communal trajectory in UPPolarisation at work in UP: With elections round the corner, Yogi Adityanath is back with hate campaignPresenting the account of Adityanath government's work during the last 4.5 years before the media on Thursday evening, Shukla said: “The ancestors of the Muslims of India are lord Ram, Krishna, and Shankar (Shiva). They do not need to see the land of Kaaba. These people should bow to the land and culture of India”."After Syria and Afghanistan, some people from different countries want to make the world an Islamic State. Some in India have this mindset too. But, the Modi and Adityanath governments at the Centre and state have raised the flag of Hindutva and Indian culture in the country and defeated this mindset,"Shukla said.Referring to controversial posters put up in Sambhal recently, Shukla said they were the outcome of Samajwadi Party's support to Islamic terrorists and its MP Shaifur Rehman Barq's statement supporting the Taliban.Posters calling Sambhal the land of the "ghazis", an apparent reference to Islamic warriors, had come up ahead of AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi's meeting there earlier this week.The BJP had strongly objected to the posters, after which they were removed by workers of the All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM).Shukla said "ghazis" have been completely eradicated from Uttar Pradesh. Such powers will not be able to raise their heads in the future, he said.Attacking Owaisi, Shukla said his ancestors wanted to make Hyderabad a separate nation but could not succeed."There are still people with such mentality. These are stupid people. Their ancestors became Muslims out of fear. This kind of thinking cannot flourish under the Modi and Adityanath governments," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/muslims-should-bow-to-indian-culture-ram-krishna-shiva-were-their-ancestors-up-minister-315590

24-09-2021||Chandigarh||ITBP vets’ new ‘hop-on-hop-off’ surgery protocol for dogs reduces sedation time, stress||Veterinary surgeons of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) have conducted a life-saving geriatric ‘hop-on-hop-off’ surgery (HOHO-GS) on a service dog for the first time in the country. The surgical technique entails a special anaesthetic protocol with a minimal time of deep surgical anaesthesia so that old dogs can have minimal stress on their liver, kidneys, lungs and cardiovascular system.The female dog, Machali, was leading a retired life at the K9 Veteran’s Home at ITBP’s National Training Centre for Dogs in Bhanu near Chandigarh, when she started showing life threatening symptoms of ‘closed pyometra’ in which geriatric dogs die within 24-72 hours due to systemic septicemia.“This unique surgery conducted by our surgeons has given a new path breaking HOHO-GS technique that reduces the surgical anaesthesia time by 80 per cent, with a shorter incision. A smaller incision and minimal handling of soft tissues resulted in blood-less surgery,” Deputy Inspector General Sudhakar Natarajan, ITBP’s senior-most veterinary officer, said.“The deliberate incision of the suspensory ligament instead of digitally strumming it, as is usually taught in medical colleges, was another new way to reduce surgery time and causing less post operative complications,” he added.DIG Natarajan said that the ITBP has devised the unique calibrated anaesthetic protocol is short and it is further shortened by reversal agents that nullify the deep sedation within few minutes after the last suture is completed. The dog wakes up within minutes and hops off the operation table after surgery as if nothing had happened, thereby terming the procedure as HOHO.The 11-year old Machali, who retired last year after a decade of performing security duties, was back to her normal routine almost immediately after the surgery that had been performed by Dr Hitesh Shandilaya , Deputy Commandant (Vet) and the chief surgeon at the center, along with Dr Rajender Joshi, Deputy Commandant (Vet).“ITBP is ready to impart this new anaesthetic and surgical technique to other Central Armed Police Forces and state police forces as well as civilian veterinarians for the welfare of all dogs as the procedure involves minimal anaesthesia, minimal surgical time, minimal incision, minimal blood loss, minimal pain and minimal surgical stress including minimal healing time,” DIG Natrajan said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/itbp-vets-new-hop-on-hop-off-surgery-protocol-for-dogs-reduces-sedation-time-stress-315579

I recall your kind words of solidarity that time,” he added.Modi said that the US Government, companies based in the USA and the Indian diaspora were very helpful when India was fighting a tough wave of COVID-19 infections.He said that four million people of Indian origin are acting as a bridge of friendship between the two countries.On her part, Harris described India as a "very important partner" to the US and welcomed New Delhi's announcement that it will soon resume vaccine export.India stopped the export of COVID-19 vaccines after the second wave of the pandemic hit the country in April this year.On Monday, India said that it will resume export of surplus COVID-19 vaccines in the fourth quarter of 2021 under the ''Vaccine Maitri'' programme and to meet its commitment to the COVAX global pool.On the issue of the climate crisis, she told Modi that the US working together with India can have not only a profound impact on people of nations but around the world itself."As relates to the Indo-Pacific, the US stresses on maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific,” she said.She said the world is more interconnected and more interdependent than ever before. "And the challenges that we face today have highlighted that fact. COVID-19, climate crisis and the importance of our shared belief in the Indo-Pacific region,” she said.Harris said that it is incumbent on the two nations to protect democracies in the best interests of their people."As democracies around the world are under threat, it is imperative that we defend democratic principles and institutions within our respective countries and around the world. And that we maintain what we must do to strengthen democracies at home and it is incumbent on our nations to of course protect democracies in the best interests of people of our countries,” she said.Their meeting comes a day ahead of the maiden bilateral meeting between Modi and President Joe Biden and the Quad Leaders' Summit at the White House on Friday.Since taking office, Harris has met with or spoken to over 30 world leaders, promoting US interests on issues ranging from global health to climate change to cyber threats.

24-09-2021||Washington||PM Modi meets Australian counterpart Morrison in US ahead of 1st in-person Quad Summit||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday met his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison here ahead of the first in-person Quad meeting to be hosted by US President Joe Biden and discussed a wide range of subjects aimed at deepening the economic and people-to-people linkages between the two countries.The meeting between Modi and Morrison came a week after they spoke over phone and reviewed the rapid progress in the India-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, including through the recent 'two-plus-two' dialogue, and exchanged views on regional developments and the forthcoming Quad meeting.“Advancing friendship with Australia. PM @ScottMorrisonMP held talks with PM @narendramodi. They discussed a wide range of subjects aimed at deepening economic and people-to-people linkages between India and Australia,” Office of Prime Minister Modi said on Twitter.Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi termed the meeting as “another chapter in our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Australia”.“Another chapter in our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Australia! PM @narendramodi and @ScottMorrisonMP met today. Discussed regional & global developments as well as ongoing bilateral cooperation in areas related to Covid-19, trade, defence, clean energy & more,” Bagchi said on Twitter.The meeting assumes significance as External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on September 11 held the 'two-plus-two' talks in New Delhi with their Australian counterparts Marise Payne and Peter Dutton.It was the first meeting between the prime ministers of India and Australia since the AUKUS (Australia, the UK and the US) security partnership was unveiled last week by US President Biden, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Morrison.The AUKUS partnership, seen as an effort to counter China in the Indo-Pacific, will allow the US and the UK to provide Australia with the technology to develop nuclear-powered submarines for the first time.Australia said its decision to join a security alliance with the US and the UK is aimed at developing capabilities that can contribute along with India and other countries in deterring behaviour that threatens the peace and security in the Indo-Pacific.In the first reaction from India on the contentious alliance, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Tuesday said that the new security agreement among the US, the UK and Australia is neither relevant to the Quad nor will have any impact on its functioning, and they are not groupings of a similar nature.Shringla said while the AUKUS is a security alliance among the three countries, the Quad is a plurilateral grouping with a vision for a free, open, transparent and inclusive Indo-Pacific.The Quad comprises India, the US, Japan and Australia.US President Biden is hosting the first in-person Quad summit at the White House on September 24 to be attended by Modi, Morrison and Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.Developments in Afghanistan, the COVID-19 pandemic and ways to expand cooperation for a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific are set to be the central focus of the four-nation grouping Quad.France reacted angrily to the formation of the new AUKUS alliance as it resulted in Paris effectively losing a multi-billion dollar deal to build 12 conventional submarines for Australia. France is also upset over its exclusion from the alliance.China has also slammed the formation of the AUKUS.

24-09-2021||New Delhi||In anticipation of stubble burning, Bhupender Yadav discusses action plan with Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab and UP||As the season of stubble burning sets in, putting under the spotlight pollution levels in north India, Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav on Thursday discussed the implementation of the Commission for Air Quality Management action plan to mitigate air pollution due to ‘parali’ burning and factors like dust, construction and demolition waste, vehicular pollution and combustion of solid waste, with stakeholders Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.Expressing satisfaction at the response of all states, Yadav said yesterday he also talked with Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi who assured him complete cooperation.“It was heartening to note that the spirit with which the Commission for Air Quality Management was conceived is reflected in the action plan of states. The outcome of the action plan will significantly depend on the efficacy of the enforcement and implementation by states,” he said.Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, environment ministers of Delhi, UP, Rajasthan, senior officials from Punjab and Ministries of Agriculture, Power, Animal Husbandry and chairperson of Air Quality Commission MM Kutty were present at the meeting which discussed various in-situ and ex-situ measures for control and prevent large-scale stubble burning.Yadav said Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has done a project of bio-decomposition in the five states and efforts have been made by Haryana for bio-decomposition in 1 lakh acres, by Punjab in 5 lakh acres and by Delhi in 4000 acres.The Environment Ministry has also held discussions for using ‘parali’ for generation of electricity and animal fodder with Agriculture and Power ministries.The Power Ministry along with state-owned power generator NTPC will procure 20 million tonnes of bio-pellets made of farm stubble, including Punjab, to be used as fuel along with coal.Directions have been issued to all thermal power plants within a 300-km radius of Delhi to co-fire biomass pellets with coal, which will not only help utilise ‘parali’ but also enhance income of farmers, he said.The Agriculture Ministry, which has earmarked Rs 400 crore for the next five years for tackling stubble burning, has made a task force to use it as cattle feed, identifying Kutch in Gujarat and Jaisalmer in Rajasthan for this. Yadav said with the collaborative efforts of all stakeholders, local administration, regulatory bodies and enforcement agencies coupled with aggressive awareness campaign, he was positive there will be significant improvement in air quality in Delhi-NCR region.“In-situ management of stubble by bio-decomposition in large scale by UP, Haryana, Delhi and Punjab, mandatory use of bio-mass with 50 per cent paddy straw as a supplement fuel in thermal power plants in NCR, setting up of a task force to work on mode and means for utilising it as fodder in Rajasthan and Gujarat, common manure development facility using rice straw and private participation to encourage in-situ management of (bio-decomposition) are steps in the direction,” he said.Yadav said states are also making efforts at their own level. Haryana has allocated Rs 200 crores as incentive to farmers for containing stubble burning. UP is doing bio-decomposition in 10 lakh acres with an innovative exchange programme allowing exchange of ‘parali’ with cow dung-based manure.Other actionDirections issued to NCR states, road owning agencies and municipal bodies for abatement of dust from roads /open areas through a ‘Dust Control and Management Cell’.For mitigating the industrial pollution, shifting of industries to PNG/cleaner fuels.All identified 124 border entry points of Delhi provided with RFID system to avoid traffic congestions.PUSA bio-decomposer technology will be deployed free of cost in Haryana for management of 1 lakh acres, in Delhi for 4,000 acres and Punjab around 7,413 acres. Apart from this, private company UPL is also targeting 5 lakh acres in Punjab, free of cost for farmers, according to officials.The composition of bio-mass pallet to be used in TPP is to have 50% stubble residue (agri-residue) as its ingredient. Further, 5-10% is the feed quantity of biomass pallet with respect to total fuel consumption (substitute to coal).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-anticipation-of-stubble-burning-bhupender-yadav-discusses-action-plan-with-haryana-delhi-rajasthan-punjab-and-up-315191
24-09-2021||Mangaldai/Guwahati||2 killed in police firing during eviction drive in Assam’s Darrang, govt orders judicial probe||Staccato sounds of gunfire broke the fragile peace of Sipajhar in Assam's Darrang district on Thursday as police tried to evict "encroachers", leaving two people dead in police firing, around 20 injured in clashes, and a shocking video where an apparently dead man with a bullet wound on his chest lay motionless but was still hit by a man slinging a camera.The state government announced a judicial inquiry into the circumstances leading to the incident amid mounting public anger.An order issued by the Home and Political Department's Secretary Debaparasad Misra said the government has decided the inquiry will be conducted by a retired judge of the Gauhati High Court.The incident drew condemnation, with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi calling the police action "state-sponsored fire".The public protest had erupted over the demand for rehabilitation of nearly 800 families evicted from the land they were living on for decades.Darrang Superintendent of Police Sushanta Biswa Sarma, a younger brother of Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, claimed the protesters, armed with sharp weapons, pelted the police personnel and others present with stones.Police initially fired in air to disperse the protesters but failed, forcing the men in uniform to fire at people, killing two and injuring at least ten others. Around 10 more, including policemen, were also injured in clashes.Meanwhile, a purported video of the incident has gone viral on social media where a photographer is seen kicking a person, presumably dead. The video shows hundreds of policemen firing at unseen targets from behind the trees, and a man in vest and lungi running on a dusty street. A photographer ran behind him until the time the men in uniform surrounded the man as gunshots rang in the background.The photographer was seen being led out by a policeman, but soon returned, jumped over his body, and hit him with something he had picked up lying close by. The man's left arm lifted momentarily, before he lay still, with a red circle of blood from a bullet wound on his chest, and a 'Gomosa', the traditional stole associated with Assamese pride, lying crumpled beside him.Bijay Shankar Baniya, a professional photographer, hired by the district administration to document the situation, has been arrested.The injured included eight policemen. Assistant Sub-Inspector Moniruddin is admitted to the Gauhati Medical College Hospital in a critical condition.The dead have been identified as Saddam Hussain and Sheikh Forid.The protesters have been dispersed and the eviction drive continues, the SP said. The situation has been brought under control but tension prevails.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, "Assam is on state-sponsored fire. I stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in the state- no children of India deserve this." Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said in Guwahati the eviction drive will not be stopped. "The police has been entrusted with the responsibility of clearing the land from encroachers and they will continue to do it till the job is done. Eviction will stop once it is dark and resume again tomorrow," he added.The Darrang district administration has so far cleared 602.40 hectares of land and evicted 800 families since Monday, and demolished four 'illegally' constructed religious structures at Sipajhar.The chief minister had visited the place on June 7 and inspected the riverine areas allegedly encroached by "illegal settlers" near Dholpur Shiva temple and directed the district administration to clear the area for the government to start a community farming project.Assam Pradesh Congress President Bhupen Kumar Borah demanded a judicial inquiry into the "barbaric act" of police firing on protesters. "The very act of eviction is in itself inhuman especially during the Covid situation," he added.The Supreme Court had also given a directive against eviction during the pandemic situation yet the state government led by Sarma has been behaving in an autocratic manner to evict the residents of Dholpur who have been living in the area since the 1970s, he said.The people in the area have been subjected to repeated harassment by the BJP government since it came to power in 2016, Bora alleged.The party's Rajya Sabha MP Ripun Bora called the incident "barbaric and inhuman". He said, if foreigners were living in the area, the government should take steps in accordance with the law but not harass genuine citizens by expelling them from their homes.Congress Lok Sabha MP Gaurav Gogoi tweeted: "Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma's own brother is the Superintendent of Police of the Darrang district where the barbaric violence took place. It is clear that this CM-SP duo did not want a peaceful resolution to the eviction drive / The CM continues to bring shame to Assam." AIUDF MLA Ashraful Hussain tweeted "Terror force of fascist, communal and bigoted government, shooting at its own citizens....The appeal of these villagers, against eviction, is pending in the High Court. Couldn't the government wait till the Court order?" The newly formed Raijor Dal also condemned the firing incident, saying that it reflects the chief minister and the BJP's extreme "communalism and autocratic rule". Party spokesperson Ashraful Islam, in a statement, demanded that the evicted people be immediately rehabilitated.Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) President Lurinjyoti Gogoi and General Secretary Jagadish Bhuyan said the eviction was carried out in an "inhuman manner" and that the government should have given prior notice, provided the families with alternative land or housing facilities and a comprehensive rehabilitation package.The ruling BJP, however, hit right back at the opposition parties for politicising the issue for "vested interest".The government had given prior notice to the settlers to clear the land but they refused to do so at the "behest of third parties", BJP spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Kamakhya Prasad Tasa said.The police, along with officials of the district, urged the protestors to move away from the place and not indulge in violence but they refused which "makes them offenders of the law and the BJP government has no tolerance for those who are against the law", he added.

Avoid mass gatherings and non essential travel related to festivity and holidays for the next few months.”India witnessed 31,923 new cases today, with Bhushan also warning, “The second surge has not concluded. We are in midst of a second surge, even while we may be witnessing a decline.Covid appropriate behaviour has to be maintained at all times and vaccine rate has to be expanded.”Maximum new cases are still coming from Kerala and Maharashtra with 62.73 per cent of all new cases last week from Kerala. Active cases nationally are 3.01 lakh, with Kerala alone comprising 1,61,596 cases (53.57 per cent of the national burden) followed by Maharashtra’s 43,544 active cases which are 14.44 pc of the national burden.“Weekly case positivity remains under 3 per cent for the 12th week but 33 districts still have 10 per cent plus positivity with 13 districts from Kerala alone. Out of 23 districts with 5 to 10 per cent positivity, two – Bilaspur and Mandi – are from Himachal,” said Bhushan.Who is allowed Covid vaccine at home"Persons who are bed-ridden or have extremely restricted mobility or disability and special needs that may hamper their movement to vaccination centres." The Centre has asked states to list such persons and arrange their inoculation at home through mobile vaccination teams. Under the government's near to home vaccination initiative for the elderly and differently abled, 16.13 crore doses have been administered so far. It was found that some people cannot even come near to home centres due to problems. The new "at home vaccine rule" is for them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-vaccine-at-home-for-differently-abled-people-with-restricted-mobility-centre-315171
