He also greeted Doordarshan on completing 62 years of existence.Highlighting the role of the media in the context of 75 years of India’s Independence, he said when it takes up issues like Swachh Bharat the message reaches people with great speed.He suggested that the media can play a role during “Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav”, a campaign launched by the government in the run-up to the 75th anniversary of Independence, by planning 75 episodes on the freedom struggle or bringing out special supplements to mark the occasion.Talking about the centrality of content, he noted that it is said ‘content is king’ but in his experience “content is connect”. When there is better content, people automatically engage with it.As much as this applies to the media, it is equally applicable to our parliamentary system as there is not only politics in Parliament, there is also policy. He emphasized that common people should feel the connect with the proceedings of Parliament. He asked the new channel to work in that direction.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said Sansad TV will play an important role in establishing a dialogue between Parliament and people and will create awareness about the working of our democratic institutions from panchayats to parliament.Birla further said Sansad TV will disseminate information about Parliament, parliamentary Committees and other democratic institutions. It will also lead to optimum utilisation of resources. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliament-more-about-policy-than-politics-pm-modi-at-sansad-tv-launch-311632

He should apologise for this,” Patra said.“Neither has the power of Durga maa nor that of Laxmi maa decreased. What had decreased is the power of ‘Sonia mata’ because of the foolishness of her son,” Patra said, tagging his tweet with a hashtag “Dabba jaan”.BJP leaders also referred to former Congress leaders Priyanka Chaturvedi and Sushmita Dev to slam him over his comment that the RSS ignored women.“See how they (Congress) treat women in the party,” BJP leaders said in response to Gandhi’s allegation that in RSS there is no place for women while the Congress has given a woman prime minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhis-fake-hindus-comment-bjp-hits-back-asks-him-to-apologise-311622
15-09-2021||New Delhi||Russia seeks Centre’s nod for export of Sputnik Light Covid vaccine manufactured in India||The Russian ambassador has urged the Indian government to allow the export of single-dose Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik Light produced by Hetero, one of the RDIF’s partners in the production of the jab, to his country till the vaccine gets emergency use authorisation from India’s drug regulator.In a communication to the Centre, Russian Ambassador Nicholay Kudashev stated that Hetero  Biopharma Limited already has manufactured one million doses of Component 1 of the Sputnik V and two million doses of the Sputnik Light but the six-month shelf life of the vaccine may expire before its registration, which will result in the wastage of vaccine doses, sources said.The Sputnik-Light is the same as component-1 of Sputnik V.The issue, which was discussed in the meeting of the Empowered Group 5 recently, has been referred to the Sub-Group of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC)  for considering Vaccine Export Proposals, the sources said. Over the past months, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has been working closely with Indian pharmaceutical companies to ramp up the production of the Sputnik vaccine in India that could be used in the local and global markets, the ambassador stated in his communication last month.At the moment RDIF together with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is working with the authorities concerned on the registration of the Sputnik Light in India.“Hetero Biopharma Limited, one of the leading Indian pharmaceutical companies and RDIF’s partner in the production of the Sputnik Light, has already manufactured one million doses of Component I of the Sputnik V vaccine and two million doses of the Sputnik Light and intends to continue its production further.“However, a shelf life tenure of the vaccine, i.e. 6 months only, may expire before its registration, which will result in the wastage of several million doses of the vitally important Sputnik Light vaccine.“We would like to note that Indian manufacturers of the Russian vaccine are discouraged by the current ban that prevents the use of the produced Sputnik Light vaccine in India and its export to other countries,” said the communication to V K Paul, chair of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC).If permanent or time-to-time permission could be granted to Hetero Biophar Limited to export the produced Sputnik Light vaccine by selling it to RDIF until its registration in India, this could encourage the company to scale up the production of the vaccine and provide the Indian market with more supplies of the Sputnik Light by the moment of its regulatory approval, it said.Meanwhile, Sputnik Light has received the Drugs Controller General of India’s (DCGI) permission to conduct phase-3 bridging trials in India.The DCGI’s permission was based on the recommendations by the Subject Expert Committee on Covid-19 of the  Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation(CDSCO), which held its meeting on August 5.The SEC recommendations stated that the firm presented updated safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data of Phase-3 clinical trial of SARS-CoV-2 virus Vaccine---(Sputnik Light)---single-dose vaccine conducted in Russia along with the proposal to conduct phase 3 clinical trial.The Committee noted that the firm has now presented the safety and immunogenicity along with the longevity of the antibodies which gives a measure of persistence of antibodies in the participants.After detailed deliberation, the committee recommended for grant of permission for conduct of phase-3 immune-bridging clinical trial in the Indian population subject to the condition that the primary endpoint should be assessed at day 42, 90 and  180 and interim analysis can be conducted at day 42 as this data was not generated during the Sputnik V trial in India after the first dose, which was stated to be available up to day 21 only.In July, the subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) had refused to grant emergency-use authorisation for Sputnik Light. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russia-seeks-centres-nod-for-export-of-sputnik-light-covid-vaccine-manufactured-in-india-311619

However, the assumed annual revenue growth in the extension period could be lower than the present 14 per cent.There are unconfirmed reports that the Council may also discuss the possibility of bringing diesel and petrol under GST. Reports say the matter could be brought before the GST Council meeting in Lucknow after the Kerala High Court had asked for it to be discussed.The GST Council, however, is certain to take a decision on duty relief on Covid essentials such as medicines, oxygen and medical kits as the time period expires on September 30.The Council will also discuss the fate of the National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA) whose tenure ends in November. NAA was set up for two years, just after the rollout of GST, to deal with consumer complaints of companies not passing on GST rate cut benefits. As there are many pending cases, the Council will decide whether to extend its term or to pass on the cases to some other authority.The Council may also approve a common comprehensive e-portal for registration, paying tax and filing returns.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gst-meet-to-consider-extension-in-duty-cuts-on-covid-items-311613
15-09-2021||New Delhi||Vikas Dubey encounter: SC agrees to hear bail plea of wife of gangster’s close aide||The Supreme Court agreed on Wednesday to hear the bail plea of the wife of Amar Dubey, a close aide of gangster Vikas Dubey, who was killed in a police encounter last year in Uttar Pradesh.A bench of Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari said it is issuing notice to the Uttar Pradesh government in the matter.Senior advocate Vivek Tankha, appearing for Amar’s wife, said she was a minor on the date of the incident and she has been in a detention home for the past year.Eight policemen, including DSP Devendra Mishra, were ambushed in Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur, when they were going to arrest Vikas Dubey and fell to hail of bullets shot from rooftops shortly after midnight on July 3.Vikas Dubey was killed in an encounter on the morning of July 10 when a police vehicle carrying him from Ujjain to Kanpur met with an accident and he tried to escape from the spot in Bhauti area, the police had said.Following a massive search launched by the police after the July 3 incident, two of Vikas Dubey’s alleged associates, Prem Prakash Pandey and Atul Dubey, were killed by police in an encounter in Kanpur.On July 8, the police had killed Amar Dubey who carried a reward of Rs 50,000, in Maudaha village in Hamirpur district.On July 9, two more alleged aides—Kartikeya alias Prabhat and Praveen alias Bauwa Dubey—were killed in separate encounters in Kanpur and Etawah districts.Tankha, who was assisted by advocate Sumeer Sodhi, said that it is a case of an innocent person at a wrong place, at the wrong time as she was married to Amar Dubey only seven days prior to the incident of July 3.The senior counsel said that she was not named in the FIR that was registered following the July 3 incident, while her husband Amar Dubey was arrayed as accused number 14 in the FIR.The plea filed through advocate Sumeer Sodhi said, “Petitioner who was admittedly a minor on the date of incident and registration of FIR has been made an accused and arrested solely because of the fact that her husband was named in the FIR”.The bench asked Tankha as to what her age was at the time of incident. He replied that as per the order of the Juvenile Justice Board, which has subsequently been affirmed and reiterated in the impugned order, the age of the petitioner on the date of incident was 16 years 10 months and 12 days.“She has no criminal antecedents and was a meritorious student pursuing her studies. She even knows south Indian dance. She is in detention for over one year. With her husband being no more, her father wants her to start a new life,” Tankha said, adding that her father, who is not of a good financial background, had married her off before she attained the age of majority.The bench said it would like to hear the state of Uttar Pradesh in the matter and therefore it is issuing notice.Her plea said, “The petitioner can be termed as a child who was caught at the wrong place at the wrong moment because of the fact of her marriage. Had she not been married to her husband on the day of the incident, she would have been a complete stranger to the events and would not have been made an accused”. On July 8, last year, police had said that Amar Dubey, who had carried a reward of Rs 50,000, was killed in an encounter in Maudaha village of Hamirpur district. It had said that an unlicensed semi-automatic .32 bore pistol was seized from his possession and had claimed that being a close aide Amar travelled with Vikas Dubey, wherever he went, ensuring his security. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vikas-dubey-encounter-sc-agrees-to-hear-bail-plea-of-wife-of-gangsters-close-aide-311611

With Sonu Sood ji, there are prayers of lakhs of families of India who got Sonu ji’s support in difficult times,” he tweeted, tagging a news report of the IT department action.The Delhi government had recently declared Sood as the brand ambassador of the Aam Aadmi Party government’s ‘Desh ka mentors’ programme under which students will be guided in making their career choices.Other AAP leaders also came out in Sood’s support.“This is nothing but a witch hunt by an insecure government against a giant philanthropist considered a ‘messiah’ by millions. His only crime is that he worked for the welfare of the downtrodden when they were orphaned by the state,” AAP leader and MLA Raghav Chadha tweeted.AAP MLA Atishi alleged the “survey” of actor-and-philanthropist Sonu Sood by the IT Department is a clear message by BJP that they will “victimise” anyone who does good work for the country.“Was it a crime for @SonuSood to help migrants during the lockdown? Was it a crime for him to help those in difficulty?” Atishi tweeted.The actor grabbed the national spotlight for helping migrant workers reach their home states during the nationwide lockdown last year.

This will permit rapid and low cost manufacturing of many of these items in developing countries.The US now sits in a position to donate vaccines to developing countries and would like its allies to follow suit. It had earlier faced global criticism for withholding vaccine exports and even their raw materials till it had vaccinated its population as well as build up stocks of booster doses. India has still to reach that comfort level.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modis-dilemma-at-un-to-begin-vaccine-maitri-or-build-up-domestic-stocks-311604

Ye jhoote Hindu hain. Ye Hindu dharm ka prayog karte hain, ye dharm ki dalali karte hain, magar ye Hindu nahin hain (What kind of Hindus are they? They are fake Hindus.

15-09-2021||Kochi||Kerala HC permits abortion of 26 week plus pregnancy of rape victim||The Kerala High Court has permitted termination of the 26 week long pregnancy of a minor rape victim, at her risk, saying that freedom of a pregnant woman in making a choice as to whether the pregnancy should be continued cannot be taken away.The court also said that under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, where any pregnancy is alleged by the pregnant woman to have been caused by rape, the anguish caused by such a pregnancy shall be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman.In view of the provision under the Act and having regard to the victim’s age and the circumstances of her pregnancy, its continuance “would involve grave injury to her physical and mental health” and “it is in the interest of justice to permit medical termination of the pregnancy”, the court said.It also directed that if the foetus survives the process, the hospital authorities have to ensure the baby’s life is protected.The court also directed the hospital to preserve blood and tissue samples of the foetus to carry out necessary medical tests, including DNA mapping.The order came on a plea moved by the minor rape victim and her parents, seeking a direction to the Kozhikode Medical College to medically terminate her pregnancy as the hospital was refusing to carry out the procedure in view of its advanced stage.The court allowed the plea after a medical board, which examined the girl, gave a report stating that she might require multiple inductions to abort the foetus, failing which surgical intervention may be required.The report also stated that the foetus may survive.It, however, said that medical termination of pregnancy can be considered in view of the facts of the case.“In the result, the writ petition is allowed and the third petitioner (victim) is permitted to undergo the procedure for termination of the pregnancy. The respondents concerned would be free to undertake the said procedure at the risk of the third petitioner. The hospital authorities shall preserve the blood sample and tissue sample of the foetus to carry out necessary medical tests including DNA mapping. In case the child is born alive, the hospital authorities shall ensure that all necessary steps are taken for protecting the life of the child,” the court said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-hc-permits-abortion-of-26-week-plus-pregnancy-of-rape-victim-311592
15-09-2021||New Delhi||Naseeruddin Shah on Bollywood’s Khans: I can speak because I don’t have much to lose||Known for speaking his mind, actor Naseeruddin Shah says he understands why the Khans of Bollywood don’t voice their opinion but he supposes he can because he doesn’t have that much to lose.The “Ankur” and “Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron” star added that he wished the Khans, who have been at the top for 20-30 years, had “more confidence” in their own abilities.“How much will they lose? They will lose an endorsement or two. It’s not that… it’s the harassment they will be subjected to. They find it difficult to take. And the fact that Aamir (Khan) and Shah Rukh (Khan) withdrew completely into a shell after making one harmless statement respectively illustrates this. I suppose I can speak because I don’t have much to lose,” Shah told India Today in an interview aired on Tuesday night.The actor said the film industry has the power to stay independent and wished they had enough courage to do so.“But they are giving in because their interests are too large and too varied and they have too much to lose and they’re easy targets.”   Shah, known for his forthrightness, also warned against “rising right wing fanaticism”. He clarified that his comments about a section of Indian Muslims celebrating the rise of the Taliban were misconstrued by the community.“Maybe I made a mistake by not speaking clearly enough and clarifying that I didn’t mean the entire Muslim community, which is how it is being interpreted by interested parties... The Muslims have taken offense to it. The Hindus are celebrating it. Neither of this was my intention.” the actor told India Today.Shah, whose video earlier this month articulating his views on the Taliban and Indian Muslims was circulated widely, has been giving a series of interviews in the last few days to clarify his comments and also voice his concerns on fundamentalism in the world and in India.Considered to be a pillar of the quality cinema movement in the industry and among India’s most talented actors, he said in another interview that he is worried about hate messages and statements advocating violence against the Muslim community but does not believe India is heading towards Talibanisation.The actor said he was surprised to be embraced by the right-wing for his statement which was misunderstood by the Muslim community.“... I do not believe that we are heading towards Talibanisation but what’s happening is pretty much worrying where you openly have statements and lectures advocating violence against the Muslim community when you have hate messages being passed on the internet and on social media.“But despite all that, I’m still not pessimistic about the future and I don’t believe that we will end up going the way of the Taliban,” he told Barkha Dutt’s Mojo Story.The veteran actor was scathing about Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s ‘abba jaan’ comment at a public speech earlier this week—that rations meant for the poor were gobbled up by those who say “abba jaan” before his government came to power.Not all Muslims call their fathers ‘abba jaan’, he responded as the remark emerged centre of a polarising debate.“I didn’t call my father abba jaan. I called him baba, and so did my Hindu wife, who called her father baba. So this person is what he is, there’s no point even reacting to him. But the fact is his ‘abba jaan statement’ is a continuation of the hate statements he has been spewing all along,” he said in his India Today interview.Shah also spoke on a Kerala priest’s controversial remarks on ‘narcotics jihad’.“When we have absurd statements like love jihad and now ‘narcotics jihad’ being made by a priest... I don’t know under whose influence he said things like that. But this is meant to alienate... or the ‘abba jaan’ statement made by the chief minister of UP recently which is beneath contempt, which is not even worth reacting to.”        Asked what he had to say to Hindus who patted him on the back for warning the Muslim community against the Taliban, Shah said more Hindus should speak against rising right-wing fanaticism in India.“Some moderate Hindus, this time, have spoken against it because it’s really going a little too far.”Except for the occasional hate message on Facebook, by the fake accounts, Shah said he has not been a target but he worries about the future of his children. If they are confronted by a mob, they won’t have an answer about which religion they belong to as they had no such teachings, he added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/naseeruddin-shah-on-bollywoods-khans-i-can-speak-because-i-dont-have-much-to-lose-311583

15-09-2021||New Delhi||India hits out at Pakistan, OIC for raising Kashmir issue at UN Human Rights Council||India on Wednesday hit out at Pakistan as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) for raising the Kashmir issue at the UN Human Rights Commission and said the grouping has "helplessly" allowed itself to be held "hostage" by Islamabad.At the 48th session of the human rights council, India said Pakistan has been globally recognised as a country openly supporting, training, financing and arming terrorists, including UN proscribed terrorists, as a matter of state policy.  India's response was delivered by Pawan Badhe, the first secretary in India's permanent mission in Geneva. Exercising India's rights to respond to comments made by Pakistan and the OIC on Kashmir, Badhe said it does not need lessons from a "failed state" like Pakistan which is the "epicentre of terrorism and worst abuser of human rights". He said it has become a habit for Pakistan to misuse the platforms provided by the council to propagate its false and malicious propaganda against India. "The council is aware of Pakistan's attempts to divert the council's attention from serious human rights violations being perpetrated by its government, including in the territories occupied by it," Badhe said. "India, as not only the world's largest democracy but a robustly functional and vibrant one, does not need lessons from a failed state like Pakistan which is the epicentre of terrorism and worst abuser of human rights," he said. The Indian diplomat said Pakistan has failed to protect the rights of its minorities, including Sikhs, Hindus, Christians and Ahmadiyas.  "Thousands of women and girls from minority communities have been subjected to abductions, forced marriages and conversions in Pakistan and its occupied territories," Badhe said in his statement.  "Pakistan has been engaged in systematic persecution, forced conversions, targeted killings, sectarian violence and faith-based discrimination against its ethnic and religious minorities," he said.  Badhe said incidents of violence against minority communities, including attacks on their places of worship, their cultural heritage, as well as their private property have taken place with impunity in Pakistan.  "Pakistan is a country which has been globally recognised as a country openly supporting, training, financing and arming terrorists including UN proscribed terrorists, as a matter of state policy," he said. "The relevant multilateral institutions have been raising serious concerns on its failure to stop terror financing and lack of effective actions against terror entities," Badhe said. He said dissenting voices from civil societies, human rights defenders, journalists are muzzled daily in Pakistan, with the support of the government.  "Enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, murders and abductions have been used as a tool for subjugation and to muzzle any form of dissent or criticism. The impunity with which such abuses have been carried out exposes the hollowness of Pakistan's commitment to human rights," Badhe added. He also slammed the OIC for raising the Kashmir issue at the council, asserting that the group has no locus standi to comment on the internal affairs of the country. "We once again regret and reject the reference made by the OIC to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir which is an integral part of India," Badhe said.  "The OIC has helplessly allowed itself to be held hostage by Pakistan, which holds the chairmanship of their Geneva Chapter, to subserve its own agenda. It's for the members of the OIC to decide if it is in their interest to allow Pakistan to do so," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-hits-out-at-pakistan-oic-for-raising-kashmir-issue-at-un-human-rights-council-311580

It was built with a vision to serve the nation through rural reconstruction. The proposed Sevagram in Raipur will have a Visitors centre to spread Gandhian ideologies, arts and craft village, Old age home and a school for the underprivileged. It intends to empower the locals by the economy generated by tourism, by celebrating the artisans of Chhattisgarh, by providing a second home for the elderly and by building a world-class system for knowledge for the best minds in the state with a motive to fight poverty, the release added.The Visitors Center in the proposed Sevagram will be a place to learn, a place to re-live, a place to remember Gandhi and to commemorate him. The proposed Arts village will mirror the simplicity and traditions of the state and its people. Chhattisgarh is known for its distinct arts and craft. Bastar, Raigarh and other districts of Chhattisgarh have various art forms using bell metal, wrought iron, terracotta, stone, fabric and bamboo. The tribal families in the Bastar and Sukma districts celebrate many festivals and fairs, which require ample common space for the villagers to set up such fairs and interact. Sewagram will be a place where visitors will experience local Arts & Crafts, local cuisine through the community kitchen and host cultural events in an open-air theatre. The old age home is intended at making a second home for those elderly separated from their family and who need care. This ashram creates a holistic ecosystem that can offer its residents a quality of living and engagement with the other site activities. The idea of sustainable living having symbiosis between the elderly and site activities can make a very homelike experience. After all, Mahatma Gandhi believed that “ The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others”. A schooling system inspired by the ancient Indian Gurukuls, well equipped to empower young Indians to take over the 21st century. The intent is to end poverty by providing education. As the saying goes - “The education of just one underprivileged child changes the future of many generations of the family as they are destined to move out of poverty" The government aims to make the project environmentally and financially self-sustainable by creating biodiversity parks and revenue streams by promoting arts and crafts and tourism. It will identify land in Nava Raipur in & the work plan will be presented before 2nd October by NRDA. Building on the principles of sustainability, all the raw materials will be locally sourced.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chhattisgarh-plans-sevagram-to-propagate-gandhian-philosophy-in-21st-century-311578

15-09-2021||Lucknow||UP elections: Congress asks ticket aspirants to deposit Rs 11,000||The Uttar Pradesh Congress has asked those seeking party tickets for the Assembly elections next year to deposit Rs 11,000 with their applications, saying the move is meant to keep away candidates who are not serious.“All applicants should submit their applications with the authorised persons at the district/state level along with a ‘sahyog rashi (contribution amount)’ of Rs 11,000 by September 25, 2021,” an order issued on Tuesday by Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Ajay Kumar Lallu said.The party had invited applications from prospective candidates last week after a two-day-long brainstorming session helmed by its national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.“Workers interested in contesting the coming elections can give their applications at the state or district headquarters,” Congress spokesperson Dr Uma Shankar Pandey had said on Saturday.Explaining the decision to ask for the ‘contribution amount’, party spokesperson Ashok Singh said the move is meant to screen out candidates who are not serious.A senior party office bearer said that with the start of the nomination process,  people who are not serious are casting their lot in the fray too, creating unnecessary problems.There is nothing new in seeking contribution, he said.“All opposition parties take it as a deposit in their party accounts, some even take huge amounts personally for allotting tickets and are notorious for it,” he claimed.UPCC media convenor Lalan Kumar said the step has been taken to improve the election process and finalisation of candidates.“Everything is transparent, the amount will be deposited in the UPCC fund and no individual is asking for it,” he added.The order said the amount can deposited through RTGS, demand draft or pay order, and a receipt will be issued.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra arrived in the state capital last week to review preparations for the elections and held long meetings with several party leaders, office bearers, and functionaries zone-wise.Being actively led by her this time, the Congress hopes to swing its fortune in the state.The party had won only seven seats out of 403 in the state elections held in 2017.

15-09-2021||Mumbai||Opposed to Muslim fundamentalists and Hindu extremism: Javed Akhtar||Noted film personality Javed Akhtar says he is as opposed to Muslim fundamentalists as he is to Hindu extremism, noting that he has even received death threats from Muslims because of his outspokenness.Defending his recent interview in which he drew parallels between the Taliban and Hindu extremists, he said Hindus are the most decent and tolerant people in the world but while the Taliban have a free hand in Afghanistan, India's secularism is protected by its Constitution and courts.Akhtar expressed the views in a statement to PTI, days after remarking on a TV channel that while the Taliban were “barbaric”, those in India supporting Hindu right-wing organisations were “all the same”."India can never become like Afghanistan because Indians by nature, are not extremists; it is in their DNA to be moderate, to keep to the middle of the road,” he said in the emailed statement.“Yes, in this interview I expressed my reservations against organizations affiliated to the Sangh Parivar. I am opposed to any school of thought that divides people on the basis of religion, caste and creed and I stand by all those who are against any such discrimination,” he added.The noted screenwriter and lyricist said he finds many commonalities between the mindsets of the Taliban and the Hindu right-wing.“My critics are also outraged that I find a lot of commonalities between the mindsets of Taliban and the Hindu right-wing. As a matter of fact, there is a lot of commonality. The Taliban is forming an Islamic government based on religion, the Hindu right-wing wants a Hindu Rashtra,” Akhtar said.“The Taliban wants to curb women rights and put them on the margin, the Hindu right-wing has also made it clear that they don't like the freedom of women and girls; right from UP, Gujarat to Karnataka young men and women have been beaten mercilessly for sitting together in a restaurant or a garden or any public place.Like the Muslim fanatics, even the Hindu right-wing does not accept the right of women to choose their spouse, he said.“Recently a very important right-wing leader said that women are not capable of being left on their own or being independent. Like the Taliban the Hindu right-wing also claims the superiority of faith and ‘astha' over any man-made law or court,” Akhtar wrote.“The Taliban has no love lost for any minority; similarly, what kind of thoughts and feelings the Hindu right-wing nurtures for the minority is evident from their speeches and slogans and whenever they get an opportunity, by their actions,” he said.The only difference between the Taliban and these extremist groups is that the Taliban today have unchallenged power in Afghanistan with no one to question them while in India there is a huge resistance against the Indian version of this Talibani ideology which is totally in conflict with the Constitution of India, he said.“Our constitution does not discriminate on the basis of religion, community, caste or gender. We have institutions like the judiciary and media too. The key point of departure between the two is the Taliban has achieved its goal in Afghanistan. The Hindu right-wing is doing its best to get us there. Fortunately, this is India and there are the Indian people who are providing a stiff resistance,” he said.Speaking to NDTV on September 3 about the rising hate crimes against Muslims in India, Akhtar had warned that such incidents were “kind of a dress rehearsal for becoming like full-fledged Taliban”.Akhtar said he had no idea that his comments would generate such sharp reactions.“On one hand, there are some people who have expressed their outrage and anger in the strongest language possible, on the other hand, there are people from every nook and corner of the country who have given me messages of solidarity and expressed their total agreement with my point of view,” he said in the statement.“My detractors have said that while I am criticizing the Hindu right-wing I have never stood against fanatics among the Muslim fold. They have accused me of not saying anything about triple talaq, of not speaking on purdah or any other regressive practice within the Muslim community. I am not surprised at the fact that they are totally unaware of my activities over the years,” he said.“Over the past two decades, I have been given police protection twice because of the threats to my life from fanatical Muslims: first, because not only had I vociferously opposed triple talaq when the issue was not on the national radar, but I had, along with an organisation named Muslims for Secular Democracy (MSD), toured several cities across India like Hyderabad, Allahabad, Kanpur and Aligarh and from a variety of public platforms spoken out against this retrograde practice,” he said.

In the two days since Monday after the depression over the Bay of Bengal crossed Odisha coast near Bhadrak, the state received an average 155.9 mm rainfall triggering floods in urban and rural areas, an official at the Special Relief Commissioner's (SRC) office said.    The precipitation was the highest in Angul and Sonepur districts which received over 300 mm rainfall. Talcher in Angul district received the highest rainfall of 394 mm followed by 372 mm at Birmaharajpur in Sonepur district. Eighteen districts got rainfall in the range of 200 mm to 300 mm and the remaining ten received 100 to 200 mm rainfall, the official said.The depression over north Chhattisgarh and adjoining north interior Odisha has now moved further west-northwestwards at a speed of 12 kmph and lay centered at about 80 km south-southwest of Ambikapur  in Chhattisgarh and about 190 km east-northeast of Raipur, the IMD said in its latest bulletin.The system is very likely to weaken into a well marked low pressure area during the next 24 hours and continue to move west-northwestwards across Madhya Pradesh during the next 48 hours, it said.SRC P K Jena said that the calamity has affected over 20.46 lakh people in 3696 villages and 27 urban local bodies spread over 20 districts. “As many as 13,534 people staying in low laying areas were evacuated and kept in shelters for safety,” he said adding that preliminary report indicated that about 2,870 houses have been damaged due to pounding rains on Monday and Tuesday.The calamity has also caused severe damage to about 100 roads and left 25 villages marooned.As per preliminary reports received from districts there have been four human causalities ,including a  three-year-old girl in a wall collapse in Ganjam in southern Odisha. Two persons also died due to wall collapse in Kendrapara district, the SRC said adding one man in Khurda district drowned.One person is missing in Nischintakoili block of Cuttack district, he said.With the water levels of almost all rivers rising due to the heavy rain that pounded Odisha for the last 36 hours, the state government asked all the district collectors to evacuate people from low-lying areas.The engineer-in-chief of the water resources department, Dhiren Kumar Samal, however, said there was no such flood fear now.Baitarani river was flowing at 18.30 m against the danger level of 17.83 m at Akhuapada and Jalaka river in Balasore district was flowing at 6.37 m against the danger mark of 5.5 m at Mathani.Rivers like Mahanadi, Subarnarekha and  Budhabalang though showing a rising trend are flowing much below the danger level, an official of the water resources department said adding that constant vigil is maintained at different places to avert destruction due to flooding.With preliminary report indicating extensive damages, the SRC has asked the district collectors to submit a damage assessment report within a week. In a letter to the collectors, Jena said the submission of the damage assessment report by September 22, 2021 will help in disbursing funds to the affected people at the earliest.He directed the collectors to process cases of human casualties online expeditiously through the Disaster Assistance Monitoring and Payment System (DAMPS) for sanction and payment of ex-gratia to the next of kin of the deceased.His letter said geo tagged and time stamped photograph of damaged houses and crop area must be taken during assessment and preserved in case records. In instances of damage to houses, photos of the beneficiaries may be taken along with the damaged house at the background. If houses were fully damaged or severely inundated for more than two days, the affected household must be provided with assistance for clothing and utensils in addition to the prescribed house building assistance, it stated. Joint teams of revenue, agriculture and horticulture departments personnel will carry out crop loss assessment, the letter said. The district administrations were also directed to start disbursement among people, who suffered damages due to the incessant rain, out of the available funds without waiting for allotment from the SRC. Jena said disbursement must be done through DBT so that the amount gets transferred to the accounts of the beneficiaries. During assessment and enumeration bank account details of the eligible beneficiaries must be collected. The district administrations were asked to provide polythene to the affected households immediately.  The state government has declared heavy rain as state specific disaster due to which expenditure on relief measures, immediate repair and restoration of the damaged public infrastructure will be met from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).

Senior counsel PS Patwalia — representing Maharashtra and Bihar — said in Bihar around 60 per cent posts were lying vacant on account of ambiguity over the issue.Attorney General KK Venugopal said the ruling in M Nagaraj’s case needed a fresh interpretation as it left a lot of ambiguities regarding reservations in promotions.He said the Centre was constrained to make 1,400 promotions on an ad-hoc basis based on seniority to ensure that the functioning of the departments wasn’t affected, but contempt petitions had been filed against the Home Secretary over these appointments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-wont-revisit-decision-on-quota-in-promotion-to-scs-sts-311290

First arrest was made in Maharashtra, then two from Delhi, following that we tied up with UP ATS to arrest three from there,” Thakur said. The police have also recovered arms, ammunition and explosives, including high-quality Italian pistols, that were supposed to be used for targeted killings from their possession.“Two among them had gone to Muscat and from there they went to Pakistan. They were trained in explosives. They were operating as a sleeper cell. It appears that there was close coordination with individuals from across the border. Dawood Ibrahim’s brother Anis Ibrahim was part of the team. The funding was being done through Hawala network. They were scouting cities with an aim to implement attacks during the festival season,” Thakur said.The officer said the arrested terrorists have stated that there were 14-15 Bangla-speaking persons, who had traveled with them to Pakistan. They might also have been taken to a similar training to Pakistan, he said, adding that the terror module was being handled from across the border.The terrorists had formed 2 teams, one of them being coordinated by Anees, the officer said, while claiming that the responsibility of this group was to get the arms and ammunition into India from across the border and conceal it here for opportune time to launch attack and the other team was tasked to facilitate funding through Hawala.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-police-bust-pak-organised-terror-module-linked-to-gangster-dawood-arrest-6-terrorists-311071

15-09-2021||Vibha Sharma||BJP’s Mission UP 2022: PM inaugurates Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh State University in Aligarh||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 14Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday laid the foundation stone of a university in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh named after prominent Jat king, freedom fighter and social reformer from the region, Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh.Apart from educational benefits for the people, the BJP hopes to reap great political advantage from the Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh State University, a massive education project in Aligarh.It is being seen as an effort to win back the dominant Jat community in western UP, the hotbed of the farmers’ agitation against the three central farm laws and sugarcane prices.Jats, both Hindu and Muslim, constitute a sizeable population in the western UP.Speaking on the occasion, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath called the Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor and Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh State University biggest gift to the region on the occasion of Radha Ashtami. He also spoke of the arrear payments to sugarcane farmers and other benefits to the farmers by the government.BJP leaders say the university is being established by the state government in memory and honour of the Jat leader who remained unacknowledged for his contributions to the country.Singh had leased land to the AMU in 1929, leading BJP and RSS leaders to demand that the university be named after him.A controversy erupted when some local BJP leaders demanded that the AMU be renamed after him as it was "built on the land donated by the late Raja".Following this, Yogi Adityanath announced that a state-level university named after him would be set up in Aligarh.According to Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma, establishing the state university in the name of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh is the state government's way of paying tribute to the man who devoted more than three decades of his life living in exile and fighting for India’s freedom but remained unsung."Mahendra Pratap was the president of India’s first provisional government in exile establishing in Kabul in 1915 with the help of different Afghan tribal chiefs and heads of some governments including Japan’s," he said. The university is being set up in a total area of over 92 acres at Lodha village and Musepur Kareem Jarouli village of Aligarh’s Kol tehsil. It will provide affiliation to 395 colleges of the Aligarh division.Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh was an alumnus of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental Collegiate School which later became the AMU. He was felicitated during the centenary celebrations of the university in 1997, according to reports.PM lauds Raja Mahendra Pratap SinghPM Narendra Modi said the university is a way to recognise the contributions of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh towards nation building from which every youth in the country can learn.The PM said Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh wanted freedom for the country and dedicated his entire life to achieve that. However,  his contributions were “ignored”."So many people spent their entire lives towards freedom struggle and national building," he said, adding that the "mistakes of the 20th century are being rectified by 21st century India". Whether it is Maharaja Suhel Dev or Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, an honest attempt is being made to recognise their contributions, he said. "For India's freedom he travelled across the world without worrying about his own life. I want to tell the youth that whenever they feel a challenge or find some difficulty, they should remember Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh," the PM said. Calling it a big day for western UP where Radha Ashtami is being celebrated today, he also invoked Kalyan Singh, the OBC leader who passed away recently. He also recounted the infrastructure projects in poll-bound UP, including the defence corridor in Aligarh, by the Yogi Adityanath government.Invoking Chaudhary Charan Singh, who is also known as farmers' champion, the PM said he was most worried about small farmers who constituted 80 per cent of the total farmers in the country."It is important that the government stands by them. Eight out of 10 farmers in the country have small land holdings which is why the government wants them to be empowered," he said while speaking about “pro-farmer” policies of his government.“We have to defeat anti-development efforts,” he said, also launching a scathing attack on previous governments over law and order in the state."There was a time when the state was run by goons and mafia, who are all behind the bars now," he said, showering praises on CM Yogi Adityanath.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-mission-up-2022-pm-inaugurates-raja-mahendra-pratap-singh-state-university-in-aligarh-310996
15-09-2021||New Delhi||Lok Janshakti Party's Bihar MP Prince Raj booked for rape||Lok Janshakti Party MP Prince Raj has been booked on rape charges here following a direction by a court, the police said on Tuesday.A complaint was filed three months ago by the alleged victim, who is a party worker, and the case was registered under Sections related to rape, criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence, they said.LJP spokesperson Shravan Kumar defended Prince Raj and claimed that the allegations against him are a “political conspiracy” to malign him. He said the MP had lodged a complaint of “extortion and blackmailing” with the Delhi Police on February 10 against the woman, who has accused him of rape.The alleged rape took place in 2020, according to the complaint.“The court’s direction came on September 9 and a case has been registered under relevant Sections at the Connaught Place Police Station,” a police officer said.Police said that an investigation is under way and nobody has been questioned in this regard yet.Without naming anyone, Shravan Kumar alleged that it was a political conspiracy and said the police should swiftly probe the case lodged by the Samartipur MP. “We have absolute faith in judiciary,” he added.Without elaborating, he said cases of “honey-trapping” also frequently happen.Prince Raj is the cousin of LJP leader Chirag Paswan who, according to police, was also mentioned named in the FIR. The victim alleged that Chirag pressured her not to file the complaint against Prince, the police said.Chirag Paswan had earlier said that he had spoken to his cousin and the complainant when the matter was brought before him. He had asked both of them to pursue the matter with the police, he had said.Chirag Paswan and Prince Raj are estranged now, with the latter joining the party faction headed by their uncle and Union Minister Pashupati Kumar Paras.In her complaint, the victim claimed that she met Prince first at the party office. They later met on many occasions and at one such meeting, the accused allegedly gave her something to drink. When she became unconscious, he developed physical relations with her, the police said.When she confronted him later, he showed her a video recorded by him in which he was seen making physical relations with her. She also alleged that he proposed to marry her and threatened her that he would put the video on the internet, they said.She also alleged that Prince then started visiting her at odd hours.Meanwhile, Prince Raj on Tuesday moved a Delhi court seeking protection from arrest in a rape case.The anticipatory bail application is likely to come up for hearing before Special Judge M K Nagpal on Thursday.
