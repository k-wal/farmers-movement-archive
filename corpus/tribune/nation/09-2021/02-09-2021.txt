The prestigious JEE (Mains) examination is a stepping stone for admissions into IITs and NITs.The CBI teams swooped down at 19 locations in Delhi and NCR, Pune, Jamshedpur, Indore and Bangalore, they said.“The searches led to recovery of 25 laptops, seven PCs, around 30 post-dated cheques along with voluminous incriminating documents/devices, including PDC’s marksheet of different students,” CBI Spokesperson RC Joshi said.The agency’s action came after registration of a case against Affinity Education Pvt Ltd and its three directors, Siddharth Krishna, Vishwambhar Mani Tripathi and Govind Varshney, besides other touts and associates.It was alleged that the directors, in conspiracy with other associates and touts, were “manipulating the online examination of JEE (Mains) and facilitating aspiring students to get admission into top NITs in consideration of huge amounts by solving the applicant’s question paper through remote access from a chosen examination centre in Sonepat (Haryana)”, Joshi said.It was also alleged that the accused used to obtain as security aspiring students’ marksheets of classes 10 and 12, user IDs, passwords, and post-dated cheques, and once the admission was done, they used to collect heavy amounts ranging from Rs 12-15 lakh per candidate across the country, he said.“Several people are being questioned and the investigation is continuing,” he said.

02-09-2021||New Delhi||Amid fear of new Covid strains, RT-PCR test compulsory for those arriving from 7 more nations||Amid fear of new Covid-19 strains, RT-PCR test is compulsory for passengers arriving from seven more countries, including South Africa, Bangladesh and China, the Centre said on Thursday.In a letter to all states and Union territories (UTs), the government said considering reports of new mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and rising number of Variants of Concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest (Vols) globally, seven countries have been added in the list of countries whose travellers will have to get another RT-PCR test done upon landing at Indian airports apart from the one they need to get before embarking on the flight.These seven countries are South Africa, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand and Zimbabwe.In earlier guidelines issued in February, passengers from only the United Kingdom, Europe and the Middle East had to get the RT-PCR test done again upon landing at Indian airports.The Centre also asked states/UTs to ensure strict compliance to these guidelines so that the import of Vols and VoCs to India from other countries may be prevented.“The states/UTs must also strengthen their Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) activities being coordinated through the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG) network of laboratories, by sending a fixed percentage of samples of positive cases among international travellers for genome sequencing to the respective INSACOG Genome Sequencing Laboratories tagged with them,” Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in the letter.Speaking at a press conference, NITI Aayog member (Health) VK Paul noted that although the risk of mutants will exist, tools of testing, tracking, vaccination, clinical preparedness and Covid appropriate behaviour have to be strongly used.“The impact of mutants, whether it is about severity of disease or about transmissibility, is something that we understand systematically and INSACOG has huge capacity and it has been strengthened over time and using it we will look after it. The screening of international travellers from a genetic sequencing point of view is one of the most critical protocols and pillars,” he said.ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said a mutant found in Columbia is presently classified as a mutant of interest.“We are closely observing it and serious disease or rapid spread of it has not been seen, but with time we will be able to tell more about it,” he said.

02-09-2021||New Delhi||Over half of India’s adult population received at least 1 dose of Covid vaccine: Govt||More than half of India’s adult population has received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine and 16 per cent have got both, the Union government said on Thursday as the cumulative number of doses administered in the country crossed 66 crore.In Sikkim, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Himachal Pradesh all the adult population have got at least one dose of vaccine, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at a press conference.About ramping up of daily vaccinations, he said 18.38 crore doses were given in August during which 59.29 lakh doses were administered daily. The average daily vaccination in the last seven days of August has been 80.27 lakh.“That’s a huge achievement and would not have been possible without very effective and optimal participation of all healthcare workers, state governments and Union Territory administrations,” Bhushan said.On both August 27 and 31 more than one crore vaccinations took place.                              According to data shared at the press conference, the number of vaccine doses administered daily has increased from 19.69 lakh in May to 39.89 lakh in June and further to 43.41 lakh in July.In Sikkim, 36 per cent of the eligible population have been administered the second dose, in Dadra and Nagar Haveli it is 18 per cent and in Himachal Pradesh it’s 32 per cent.Besides, in Tripura, Ladakh, Daman and Diu, the Lakshwadeep and Mizoram, over 85 per cent of the population have been administered the first dose.Bhushan said that 99 per cent of the healthcare workers have received the first dose of vaccine while 84 per cent of the eligible healthcare workers have taken the second dose.He said 100 per cent of the frontline workers have been administered the first dose while 80 per cent of them have been given the second dose.“Besides, 16 per cent of India’s adult population have been fully vaccinated which means they have received both the doses of Covid-19 vaccine while 54 per cent have been administered at least one dose,” the Union health secretary said.NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr VK Paul urged people who have not got vaccinated yet to take the jabs.The message of vaccination must be taken to the heartland of India, he said, adding, “No one should be left behind. Vaccine availability is increasing and we must use this opportunity to push back this pandemic.”Paul further underlined that vaccination programmes among pregnant women must be accelerated while stating it is being seen that many people have not got vaccinated.Vaccination is important for pregnant women and their baby otherwise, the risk of complications rises. The more pregnant women can get vaccinated the better, he stressed.Paul also emphasised the need for taking the second dose.“For complete protection, the second dose is important. The level of protection one gets after the second dose is much higher than the one after the first. The complete guarantee that one gets is after the second dose.“The government is making its efforts but if your second dose is due please get it because then only you are more protected and it becomes difficult for the virus to transmit through you,” he added.

Heard. Application perused. Considering the seriousness of the allegations, the application is allowed. Accused persons are remanded to JC for 14 days,” the judge said.The judge directed the jail authorities to produce the accused before the court concerned on September 16.Chaudhary had surrendered after a recent Delhi High Court order refusing to grant him any interim protection.A trial court had earlier dismissed his anticipatory bail application, saying “we are not a Taliban State”.The court had said that in past such incidents have flared communal tensions leading to riots and loss to life and property.“We are not Taliban State. Rule of law is the sacrosanct governing principle in our plural and multi cultural society. While the whole of India is celebrating ‘azadi ka amrut mahotsav’ there are some minds still chained with Intolerant and self centric beliefs,” the judge had said.Delhi Police had on August 10 arrested six people- Ashwani Upadhyay, Vinod Sharma, Deepak Singh, Vineet Bajpai, Preet Singh and Deepak Kumar - in connection with inflammatory sloganeering near Jantar Mantar recently.On August 11, advocate Ashwani Upadhyay was released on bail.

02-09-2021||Mumbai||Will get activist Navlakha medically examined, says Maharashtra govt||The Maharashtra government told the Bombay High Court on Thursday that it will take jailed activist Gautam Navlakha, an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, for a medical check-up to the Tata Memorial Hospital in neighbouring Navi Mumbai on Friday.The state’s counsel, public prosecutor Sangeeta Shinde, made the statement before a Bench of Justices SS Shinde and NJ Jamadar after Navlakha moved the HC earlier in the day, seeking directions to authorities of the Navi Mumbai-based Taloja prison, where he is currently lodged, to get him examined for a lump developed in his chest in March this year while in prison.In his plea, Navlakha, 69, also sought that he be placed under house arrest as part of his judicial custody, owing to his advanced age and a host of medical ailments that he suffers from.Navlakha cited the Supreme Court’s order issued in May this year, whereby the apex court had dismissed his default bail plea, but found merit in treating house arrest as an alternative form of detention, especially for such undertrials who are aged or suffering from serious medical ailments.In his plea, Navlakha also said that with 15 people accused in the case, the charge sheet spanning over 30,000 pages and over 150 witnesses to be examined, to continue to subject him to incarceration till the completion of the trial would be extremely “unjust, harsh, and cruel”.The activist said he had always cooperated with the probe into the case and that he was a fit candidate for house arrest.Navlakha’s counsels Yug Chaudhry and Payoshi Roy also told the HC that they had already written to the Taloja prison authorities seeking a medical checkup for the lump in his chest, but were yet to hear anything from them.They told the HC that Navlakha also suffered from hypertension that he developed while in prison, and several other ailments.The activist in his plea claimed the Taloja prison was grossly inept at treating serious medical ailments suffered by inmates.He also claimed the Taloja prison staff had been callous towards the health and other needs of inmates in the past.The Taloja prison authorities had repeatedly acted in a “callous manner in the past, endangering the lives of the inmates, including the petitioner’s co-accused in the case,” Navlakha said in the plea.“Because of the negligence and stubborn refusal of officials of the Taloja prison, the ailments and medical concerns of inmates go undiagnosed and untreated for long periods of time,”, the plea said.Navlakha’s counsel Chaudhry urged the HC to allow the activist to be examined at the Mumbai-based Jaslok Hospital, a private medical facility, where his sister was an employee.Chaudhry said all expenses of the examination at the private hospital will be borne by Navlakha and his family.His request, however, was opposed by Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, who appeared for the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is conducting a probe into the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case.Singh said that accused persons must not insist on going to a hospital of their choice and suggested that Navlakha be taken by the prison authorities to a state-run hospital.The state government then proposed to take Navlakha to the Tata Memorial Hospital at Kharghar in Navi Mumbai, which is closer to the Taloja prison.While Chaudhry said the NIA was being “vindictive”, the HC pointed out that Navlakha had not made a special pleading in the petition for getting examined at the Jaslok Hospital.The Bench gave Chaudhry the option of filing an additional application, seeking that Navlakha be taken to the Jaslok Hospital.Chaudhry however, said he did not wish to waste any time and agreed to the state’s proposition of taking Navlakha to the Tata Memorial Hospital.“When your client tells you there is a lump which could possibly be cancer, you don’t want such delays,” Chaudhry told the high court. The Bench then recorded public prosecutor Sangeeta Shinde’s statement that Navlakha will be taken for a medical examination on Friday.The HC also asked the NIA to file a reply to Navlakha’s prayer for house arrest and posted the matter for further hearing on September 27.Navlakha was arrested by Pune police from Delhi on August 28, 2018 in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case.He was initially kept under house arrest, but subsequently sent in judicial custody.As per Navlakha’s plea, he has spent one year and three months in prison in connection with the case.The case relates to the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Maharashtra’s Pune district on December 31, 2017.The Pune police had claimed that the event was backed by Maoists, and provocative speeches made there led to caste violence near the Bhima-Koregaon war memorial in the district the next day.

It is a matter of great happiness that no one has died due to the coronavirus in the state in the last one month,” Gehlot said in a tweet in Hindi.“But, if there is a slight negligence, Covid can spread again. Therefore it is very important to follow coronavirus protocols, including wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing,” he added.The chief minister said more than 4.55 crore vaccine doses have been administered in the state. Over 1.10 crore people have taken both doses of the vaccine, he added.So far, 9,54,100 people have contracted Covid in the state, and the death toll stands at 8,954, Gehlot added.

This collective spirit reflects the true ethos of the Congress party,” he said at a time when bitter feuds are underway in Punjab between Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and state president Navjot Sidhu; in Rajasthan between Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot and in Chhattisgarh between Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel and health minister TS Singhdeo.Gandhi drew the party’s attention to “economic mismanagement and fire sale of Indian assets” by the BJP saying this needed to be fought at all levels.The former Congress chief also took aim at the Left Democratic Front government saying “in Kerala we have to fight another divisive ideology (apart from the BJP)”.“Today, our nation is at a critical crossroad. As the principal opposition party, the Congress party has a moral duty to fight these forces that threaten the very idea of India. Modi govt has clearly mishandled the economy. And, what this country has built over the last 70 years, is being given away to select few friends of the PM. Congress party must oppose this fire sale of our crown jewels at every level,” Gandhi said attacking the National Monetisation Pipeline.He said the Congress is not against privatisation but our privatisation plan and it never privatised strategic industries like Railways.Gandhi also said the government has come up with a new concept of GDP, wherein a rise in GDP means a rise in prices of Gas, Diesel and Petrol.“While international prices for crude and gas have gone down since 2014, there has been huge increase in prices in GDP in last 7 years. Rs 23 lakh crore has been earned by increasing prices of GDP in the last seven years. Where has this money gone?” he asked.Gandhi accused the government of demonetising farmers, labourers, small traders and informal sector, MSMEs, contract workers, and salaried class and monetising “four-five friends of Prime Minister Narendra Modi”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/collective-spirit-reflects-true-spirit-of-congress-ethos-rahul-gandhi-305561
02-09-2021||Ahmedabad||Depression can be classified as serious illness in context of Covid-19 pandemic: Gujarat HC||Depression can be classified as a serious illness, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Gujarat High Court has observed, while setting aside the cancellation of registration and admission of an engineering student by a government college for not appearing for requisite exams due to depression and suicidal thoughts.The court issued the order on August 31 and a copy of it was made available on Thursday.The academic performance review committee of the Surat-based Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) in October 2020 cancelled the registration and admission of the first-year B Tech (Bachelor of Technology) student, for not earning 25 credits needed for getting promoted to the next semester.The student challenged this in the HC on the ground that he had suffered from “severe depressive episodes with suicidal ideation”, which started in January 2020 and peaked in May-June last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic situation, which is why he could not appear for the examination.“In the facts and circumstances of the case and more particularly in the context of the currency of the pandemic period, the depressive state of mind and the depression created in the petitioner student, can be classified as serious illness,” the court of Justice NV Anjaria observed.The depressive cycle which the petitioner suffered was during the period of Covid-19 pandemic itself. It was a period of wide-spread despondency, the court noted.It is reasonable to believe that the situation brought about by the pandemic created an adverse effect on the tender-mind of the petitioner, who disengaged himself from the studies, it further said.“The ground advanced by the petitioner could be viewed as genuine as there is nothing to disbelieve the same. The stand of the respondent Institute to doubt is insensitive and departs from the facts stated in the letter of the parents fortified by the certificate of doctor. The reason given by the petitioner has to be appreciated in the special circumstance of the pandemic period,” the HC observed in its order.The court, in its interim order on April 23, 2021, allowed the petitioner to appear for the supplementary examination in May 2021, which he passed to secure the requisite credits to be promoted to the next semester.“The reason given by the petitioner has to be appreciated in the special circumstance of the pandemic period. It is the very reason of depressive tendencies developed in the mind of the petitioner during the pandemic which prevented him from applying on medical ground under the said Regulation (of the institute that requires a student to apply prior to the last day of examination if unable to take the exam on medical ground),” it said.Apart from cancelling the registration and admission of the petitioner, the institute had also rejected his subsequent requests to reconsider its decision, which he had challenged in the high court through his lawyer Ronith Joy.The institute had argued before the court that the case of the petitioner on medical grounds is governed by its regulation that necessitates that a student file an application prior to the last day of examination.The student had failed to make any such application, it argued, and further stated that the petitioner had not reported any medical illness even while he stayed in a hostel between January and March 2020.

Before coming to power in 2014, BJP used to ask what Congress did during the last 70 years. The answer is the list of assets which you are now selling. While we built India in those 70 years, BJP is now busy selling India," he alleged. "There is a difference between the previous Congress governments and the BJP dispensation. A sensible government always takes care that strategic sectors do not slip into the hands of a few. No sensible government encourages monopoly. "But, for the BJP government, the country is not important. They just think about votes and making BJP the world's richest party," he said. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently unveiled an ambitious Rs 6 lakh crore National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) that included unlocking value by involving private companies across infrastructure sectors - from passenger trains and railway stations to airports, roads and stadiums. As many as 25 Airports Authority of India (AAI) airports, 40 railway stations, 15 railway stadiums and an unidentified number of railway colonies have been identified for getting private investments. Khera said that Congress leaders will tour the entire country against the Centre's monetisation plan and spread awareness among the masses about its drawbacks. "The government has announced a clearance sale of the country's assets and they are now claiming that they are giving these assets on lease. Those who buy will take loans from banks. That means our assets will be purchased using our own money and then they will return those assets back after extracting everything," he added. People as well as the media need to raise their voice if they want to stop the country from getting sold, he urged. Without taking names, Khera said the scheme will only fill up the pockets of selected industrialists who are an example of BJP's "crony capitalism" system. "Time has come to seek answers. Assets worth Rs 60 lakh crore are being given to a selected few for just Rs 6 lakh crore, which is also given to them by the BJP government," said Khera. He said that although the Modi government has so far earned Rs 23 lakh crore from the hike in fuel price, the money was not spent on any pro-people work. On the issue of polarisation, the senior Congress leader accused the BJP of diverting the attention of people from key issues by raising communal points. He accused the BJP of creating "faultlines" between communities for being in power.

You are going to see more lone wolf situations,” she added.“We need to make sure we are protected. We need to make sure our cybersecurity is strong, because actors like Russia are going to continue to hack us because we show no signs of willing to fight back. We need to watch China, because I think you are going to see China make a move for Bagram Air Force Base,” Haley apprehended.“I think they are also making a move in Afghanistan and trying to use Pakistan to get stronger to go against India. So, we have got a lot of issues. The biggest thing he should do is strengthen our allies, strengthen those relationships, modernise our military, and make sure we are prepared for the cyber-crimes and the terrorist crimes that are headed our way,” she said in response to a question.Haley slammed Biden for his “disastrous” withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan. “By the end of that speech that President Biden gave, it was the beginning of the lame duck presidency for Joe Biden,” she said.“I mean, he has lost the trust and confidence of every member of the military and the military families that I'm proud to be a part of. He has lost the trust and confidence of our allies who are now negotiating without us because they don't know why we are doing what we're doing,” she said.Biden, she alleged, has lost the trust and confidence of the American people. “If you look at the fact that the jihadists are celebrating in the streets because America has run out of town – and they left them with billions of dollars' worth of equipment and ammunition as a housewarming present,” she said.“You couldn't ask for a more embarrassing, humiliating situation than what we have right now. The world is more definitely a dangerous place. Just because we are out of Afghanistan does not mean this war is over,” Haley said.

The pollution levels in this region regularly exceed those found anywhere else in the world.“Residents of this region, which includes the megacities of Delhi and Kolkata, are on track to lose more than nine years of life if the situation persists. Alarmingly, India’s high levels of air pollution have expanded geographically over time. Compared to a couple of decades ago, particulate pollution is no longer a feature of the Indo-Gangetic plains alone. For example, pollution has increased so much in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh that the average person in those states is now losing an additional 2.5 to 2.9 years of life expectancy, relative to the early 2000s,” the research states.They say the rise in air pollution in South Asian over time is not surprising.Over the last two decades, industrialisation, economic development and population growth have led to skyrocketing energy demand and fossil fuel use across the region.Most pollutedAccording to annual Air Quality Life Index update published by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, India is the most polluted country in the world, with over 40 per cent population living in the Indo-Gangetic plains of North India.1 in 3 Delhi adolescents report asthma52.8% pupils report sneezing44.9% itchy watery eyes38.4% significant cough33% itchy skin rash31.5% shortness of breath||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-pollution-can-shorten-lives-of-40-indians-by-9-years-study-305127

The WHO also classified a fifth “variant of interest” detected in Colombia, which presented immune escape potential.Based on the latest round of risk assessment, the WHO said a new variant, B.1.621, has been classified as a variant of interest and includes the descendent Pango lineage B.1.621.1. “The Mu variant has a constellation of mutations that indicate potential properties of immune escape,” the WHO said. It, however, said further studies were needed to confirm this.Another covid ‘variant of interest’ detectedSince its first identification in Colombia in January 2021, there had been a few sporadic reports of cases of the Mu variant and some larger outbreaks in other countries in South America and Europe, WHO experts said.As of August 29, over 4,500 sequences (3,794 sequences of B.1.621 and 856 of B.1.621.1) have been uploaded to the global Covid sequencing network from 39 countries.Although the global prevalence of the Mu variant among sequenced cases has declined and is currently below 0.1 per cent, the prevalence in Colombia (39 per cent) and Ecuador (13 per cent) has consistently increased. More studies are required to understand the characteristics of this variant, the world body said, taking no chances with the spread of mutations given the rapid global spread of Delta earlier this year. Meanwhile, with under 4.4 million new Covid cases reported week ending August 29, the WHO said the number of new cases globally appeared to be plateauing after having increased for two months. India was among the few nations to report a surge in new infections last week.The highest numbers of new cases were reported from the US (9,38,014 new cases; 8 per cent decrease), India (2,70,796 new cases; 17 per cent increase), Iran (2,54,753 new cases; similar to previous week), the UK (2,37,556 new cases; 8 per cent increase) and Brazil (1,75,807 new cases; 16 per cent decrease). The number of deaths reported globally was also similar to last week, with just over 67,000 new deaths reported. Among the 4 variants of concern globally, Alpha variant has now been reported in 193 countries (one new country since last week), Beta in 141 countries (no new countries), Gamma in 91 countries (five new countries) and Delta in 170 countries (seven new countries).Fresh cases 41,965Total Deaths 4,39,020Active Cases 3,78,181460 deaths in 24 hoursNod to phase 2/3 trials of Biological E’s vax on kids||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-among-few-nations-witnessing-covid-surge-who-305124

The resolution, with many prominent markers, was approved on the penultimate day of India’s presidency.The GainsIn an indication of the importance attached to the presidentship, Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually chaired a discussion on maritime security that was joined by Russian President Vladimir Putin and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, besides several more foreign ministers and heads of government. This was the first time the UNSC had a comprehensive debate on maritime security.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla travelled to New York to preside over other equally important discussions — UN peacekeepers, Daesh and Afghanistan.“I was very happy to preside over the adoption of an important resolution which has unequivocally conveyed that Afghanistan’s territory should not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter, train terrorists or plan or finance terrorist acts,” noted Shringla.“It underlines terrorist individuals and entities designated by the UNSC 1267. This is of direct importance to India,” he added.India was also active in marshalling three statements on Afghanistan during August.India, currently serving a two-year term as a non-permanent member of the 15-nation Security Council, assumed the rotating presidency of the UN body for August.Under India’s presidency, the UNSC also held discussions on Myanmar, Syria, Yemen, and the Middle East Peace Process.Several UN member states thanked India for its leadership of the UNSC.

My one semester fee here is over Rs 1 lakh and I have already run out of funds. I have started working at a car showroom under a changed name so that I could buy food and pay rent. Things are really difficult and I see no hope,” said Abdul Razzak, who is pursuing a course in architecture here.Mushtaq Wazib said, “I brought my father here for treatment. He needs a surgery. We have no money left. The institution that sponsored our visit here has also run out of funds. We are stuck. My visa has also expired. I have taken up the job of a guard at a warehouse here to make both ends meet.”A member of the automobile industry association said, “Many such people approach us for jobs daily, but it’s risky to employ anybody without visa verification. Some small units have, however, given jobs to these refugees. It will be better if the government brings some policy for them.”“Things are rather difficult for women refugees. I have somehow managed to get embroidery work from a local boutique. My father is an MP there and we had never thought that things would come to such a pass,” says Fazia, who is pursuing a course in fashion designing.“Hiring norms are very stringent in the organised sector and these do not allow accommodating such refugees in jobs.

However, many areas of the northwest and northeast are likely to get below normal rains in the last leg of the June-September season, IMD Director General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra today said.“The rainfall averaged over the country during September is most likely to be above normal (over 110% of the long period average). The LPA (long period average) during September based on the data of 1961-2010 is about 170 mm.“The September rains will help reduce the current deficiency of 9 per cent and it is expected that the accumulated rains will be around the lower end of normal in the season. “Rains are expected to decrease over Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and western UP from tomorrow,” he said. With unpredictable pace and spatial distribution, the 2021 season has been a tough one for meteorologists to crack and for farmers to plan their agriculture activities. Currently, 11 of the 36 meteorological divisions have deficient rains ranging up to 52% and more. While attributing rain shortfall in August to reasons like suppressed cloudiness and Bay of Bengal not getting sufficient remnants of typhoons this year, Mohapatra admitted to the IMD going off the mark in the prediction for Gujarat and Odisha, which are among the most affected parts. 112.1 mm   Delhi receives highest single-day rain in September in 19 years||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/but-for-northwest-above-normal-rains-this-month-305140

In a sign of change, a Taliban fighter led the evening prayer at the Kabul airport while others patrolled its periphery.Opinions pageTake one step at a time: India should engage with Taliban, which wants normalisation of relationsCatch-22 situation for India on Afghan frontSeparately, the youngest member of the Taliban peace committee, Anas Haqqani, asked India and Pakistan to not use Afghanistan “as a pawn” since they had a long enough border to settle the matter among themselves.Humanitarian crisis looming in Af: UNPM chairs meeting“Kashmir is not part of our jurisdiction and interference is against the policy. How can we go against our policy? This is clear, we will not interfere,” he said in an interview.Anas, son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, maintained that the Taliban were ready to forget the past and take forward the relationship with India which “has helped our enemy for 20 years”. He also taunted the US, saying, “Your power is gone, your hold is gone” while holding discarded prison shackles during a tour of Bagram prison where the US forces had imprisoned him for nearly six years.“We will clarify all policies in the days to come. We want all help for the people of Afghanistan. We want not only India but also rest of the world to come and support us,” said Anas as UN Secretary General Antonio Gutters warned that in the absence of resources, the country was heading towards a “humanitarian catastrophe”.Crowds amassed on Afghanistan’s borders and long queues outside banks on Wednesday suggested that the Taliban’s assurances are still being treated with skepticism. The Taliban machinery was concentrating on running essential services while its top leadership ended three days of confabulations in Kandahar without revealing much about the outcome.The Taliban are yet to announce a new government. In contrast, they had announced a leadership council soon after the first takeover in 1996. “Having no access to international aid will choke the Afghan economy and directly hurt the Afghan people with families pushed further into poverty,” said Afghan-origin economist Shah Mehrabi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wont-meddle-in-kashmir-say-taliban-joe-biden-terms-pullout-best-decision-305154

Today again we need structural failures that warrant a new economic vision. The symptom of this catastrophic failure is the declining GDP. The PM is in panic mode and cannot fathom what to do. His core ministers are also panicking. We in the Congress know exactly what needs to be done and can send our experts to the PM,” Gandhi said addressing reporters today.In a jibe on the government he said the only thing rising under the NDA government was the price of another kind of GDP—gas, diesel, petrol.Comparing global crude oil prices under the UPA regime in 2014 with today, Gandhi said despite low global prices of gas, and crude oil, domestic rates were rising.“There is a 116 pc increase in cooking gas, 42 pc increase in petrol and 55 pc increase in diesel prices today as compared to 2014 when UPA demitted office. This when global crude oil prices were 32 pc higher and international gas prices were 26 pc more in UPA times. This is truly intriguing,” the former Congress chief said, accusing the government of shifting “wealth from the poor to a select rich under the policy of demonetization followed by asset monetisation.”While farmers, workers, salaried classes are being demonetised, select industrialist friends of the government are being monetised through “sale of public assets”, alleged Gandhi.He said in seven years the BJP government had earned Rs 23 lakh crore from petrol, diesel and gas.“The youth need to ask where this money has gone,” Gandhi said.He noted that public anger against the government was “building up but was being muzzled through capture of institutions”.We are showing restraint on account of Covid but the anger is rising and there is bound to be a massive reaction, he said.The Congress leader steered clear of questions on what the party ruled Punjab, Chhattisgarh were doing to reduce prices of petrol and diesel.“That is not the question here. The question is where is Rs 23 lakh crore the Centre earned?” Gandhi quipped.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/catastrophic-economic-failure-as-in-1990s-new-vision-needed-rahul-gandhi-305080

The earliest reports are from May 2021 from South Africa. At this time, C.1.2 does not appear to be rising in circulation, but we need more sequencing to be conducted and shared globally. Delta appears dominant from available sequences.”The WHO also said that if it characterised C.1.2 of any other variant as a variant of interest or concern, the same would be widely shared.“We are monitoring dozens of variants for potential transmissibility at the moment,” said Kerkhove.She said the more the virus spreads the more opportunity it has to change.“We have the tools to prevent infections, reduce the spread and save lives. The WHO has been regularly discussing with South African researchers about their work on sequencing throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. We are grateful for researchers in South Africa who first presented their findings on variant C.1.2 to the WHO Virus Evolution Working Group in July 2021,” she said, seeking to downplay any fresh anxieties on the front of C.1.2.The C.1.2 reported recently is feared to evade vaccine-induced protections.New record — over 1.25 cr doses in a dayNew Delhi: India on Tuesday set a new record by administering over 1.25 crore Covid vaccine doses in a day — higher than the 1 crore-mark breached on Friday.
