22-09-2021||Vibha Sharma||WHO revises air quality guidelines, recommends stringent levels for key pollutants||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 22The World Health Organisation on Wednesday revised its global air quality guidelines, recommending more stringent standards for key pollutants—PM 2.5 and PM 10, ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). The WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs), which is the first update since 2005, provide recommendations on air quality guideline levels as well as interim targets.According to the new guidelines, the PM 2.5 norms for 24-hour average is now 15 µg/m3 instead of 25 µg/m3 (in 2005) and 5 µg/m3 annual instead of 10 µg/m3 (in 2005).However, even at the current relaxed standard, at 40 ug/m3 for annual PM 2.5 averages in India versus WHO’s 2005 annual limit of 10 ug/m3 most Indian cities failed to meet even those levels, says Prof S N Tripathi from the IIT-Kanpur and Steering Committee Member, National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), calling for “revising India’s air quality standards to make them more stringent”.The NCAP has a target to reduce 20-30% of PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations by 2024, taking levels in 2017 as the base year.According to Prof Tripathi there is a body of scientific evidence to prove that air pollution is leading to severe health impacts and 90% of the entire global population is breathing polluted air.“Air pollution is a severe health crisis and WHO’s revised air quality guidelines bring back the focus to the issue. There are no two ways about the need for revising India’s air quality standards to make them more stringent.“Even at the current relaxed standard of 40 ug/m3 for annual PM2.5 averages in India vs WHO’s 2005 annual limit of 10 ug/m3, most Indian cities failed to meet even those levels. In parallel, we have to strengthen our health data and revise the National Ambient Air Quality Standards accordingly.“Raw health data is required to conduct a large range of health studies vis-a-vis air pollution impacts for India’s varied demography, exposure and differing PM 2.5 composition. A single exposure prevention response will not suit the Indian population,” he adds.Dr Ravindra Khaiwal from the Environment Health department of the PGI Chandigarh says the stringent standards will bring the focus on strict and swift action for better air quality.“Air pollution has become a major risk factor for premature mortality and morbidity. Meeting the new WHO Global Air Quality Guidelines seems a challenge, but under NCAP India is committed to minimise 20-30% of cities’ air pollution. Collective efforts are needed to mitigate the air pollution and gain in terms of better human health and climate,” he said.According to WHO, air pollution is one of the biggest environmental threats to human health, alongside climate change and new AQGs provide clear evidence of the damage air pollution inflicts on human health, at even lower concentrations than previously understood.With annual mean of 40 ug/m3 of PM 2.5, India ranks third after Bangladesh and Pakistan in the pollution ranking of the Asian countries according to the 2005 guidelinesIn 2019, more than 90% of the global population lived in areas where concentrations exceeded the 2005 WHO AQG level of 10 µg/m3, it says.With the 2021 AQG levels being lower, there is bound to be an increase in the attributable health burden in all countries, it adds.According to Greenpeace, among 100 global cities, Delhi’s annual PM 2.5 trends in 2020 was 16.8 times more than WHO’ s revised air quality guidelines of 5 ug/m3, while Mumbai’s exceeded 8-fold, Kolkata 9.4, Chennai 5.4, Hyderabad 7 fold and Ahmedabad exceeded 9.8 fold.“Calculating premature deaths and financial losses due to air pollution for 10 cities across the world, Delhi accounted for the maximum number of deaths, 57,000 in 2020 and 14% of GDP loss due to air pollution. While GDP percentage share was highest amongst cities, the cost per capita was low in comparison to other cities which have higher per capita income and accumulated losses,” it says.The WHO estimates show that around 7 million premature deaths, mainly from noncommunicable diseases, are attributable to the combined effects of ambient and household air pollution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-revises-air-quality-guidelines-recommends-stringent-levels-for-key-pollutants-314759

The victim had lodged an FIR against the accused a day later and he was arrested on April 19. Since then, he has been in jail.”“We filed a bail application in the ADJ court. During hearing of the case, the judge, in view of his good behaviour in jail and apology in the court, has given bail to my client on the condition of washing the clothes of 2,000 women of the village, and pressing them, before handing it over to respective women,” he added.The court has also sent the copy of bail to village head Nasima Khatoon to keep a tab on his daily free service. Lalan Kumar will have to purchase detergent powder, soap, and irons.“This was a great decision by the court. It will give a message to respect women and also create guilt in the mind of men having anti-female nature,” Nasima Khatoon said.“I will personally monitor the daily work of the accused to implement the court order. Our village has 425 women and every woman will give clothes in rotation until the 2,000 number is achieved,” she added.She will submit her report of Lalan’s assigned service, which he has to complete in six months, and then obtain certificates from her and local police station to submit in the court. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wash-womens-clothes-bihar-courts-bail-condition-for-rape-accused-314754
22-09-2021||Kolkata||West Bengal post-poll violence: Defeated BJP candidate dies months after being assaulted||Dhurjoti Saha, the BJP candidate from Magrahat Poschim assembly seat in South 24 Parganas district who lost the April-May poll and was allegedly assaulted by TMC workers, died on Wednesday at a city hospital after being under treatment since the first week of May, the party and family members said.Saha’s wife and son have demanded CBI enquiry into the incident alleging that he had received serious head injuries in an assault by TMC workers on the day of the counting of votes on May 2.Local TMC MLA Giasuddin Mollah said he does not know who assaulted Saha as he was inside the counting centre at that time. BJP MP Arjun Singh, who visited the hospital after Saha’s death, said: “He was beaten up by the henchmen of local TMC MLA after counting trends showed he (Saha) was trailing. He had to be admitted to the hospital the next day”.   Singh told newsmen that he was beaten up by the henchmen of the local TMC MLA after counting trends showed he was trailing and had to be rushed to hospital the next day.Claiming that this was another instance of post-poll atrocities by TMC against its political opponents, Singh said BJP will soon take up the issue with National Human Rights Commission.Calcutta High Court had accepted the recommendations of an NHRC panel and on August 19 ordered a CBI probe into all alleged cases of heinous crimes like rape and murder that took place in West Bengal after the assembly poll.Saha’s wife alleged that he was assaulted outside the counting centre at Magrahat by three-four TMC activists close to the local Trinamool Congress MLA and police did not come to his rescue when he had sought their help.“He was taken home much later at the intervention of local BJP leadership and some residents of the area. He was rushed to the hospital when his condition deteriorated,” she said.Saha’s son said the hospital had previously declared him fit and had even told the family to be ready for his discharge on Wednesday. But the family was suddenly informed in the morning that he had been shifted back to the intensive care unit and then informed them about his death.“We demand CBI probe into the incident and the arrest of those behind the attack,” Saha’s wife and son said.The newly appointed state BJP president, Sukanta Majumder said that Saha’s death was “unfortunate”. “We have information that he was attacked by TMC miscreants on the day votes were counted, which led to his death. This lowers the heads of the people of Bengal. A poll candidate had been attacked in Didi’s (Mamata Banerjee’s) Bengal. This shows how opposition BJP activists and leaders are being attacked since the day of counting,” Majumdar said.Hitting out at the ruling TMC, Majumder said the party is muzzling the people’s voice in an “undemocratic manner”.The people of the state are afraid to express their views openly in the TMC regime, he said and claimed that the party does not want people to exercise their franchise.Referring to the September 30 by-poll in the state, Majumder, who was speaking to reporters, said “I will ask everyone to vote without fear, in a free manner. Vote for whoever you like and don’t feel intimidated by any party,” Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is among the contestants in the by-poll. She had lost to BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari, her former protege, in Nandigram and is seeking election from Bhabanipur seat in the city, from where she had won in 2011 and 2016, to continue in office as per rules.Continuing his criticism of Mamata Banerjee’s party, Majumder said: “TMC leaders are steeped in corruption everywhere, even in villages. They are demanding cut money for every project”.“The Enforcement Directorate is sending invitation letters to some TMC leaders”, the BJP leader said referring to the summons to TMC heavyweights by the central agency in recent times but did not elaborate. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-post-poll-violence-defeated-bjp-candidate-dies-months-after-being-assaulted-314752

22-09-2021||New Delhi||Viral video: Woman claims Delhi restaurant refused entry as she was wearing saree; eatery refutes||A video of a restaurant allegedly refusing entry to a woman wearing a saree contending the attire did not come under the "smart casual" category has gone viral on social media, with the restaurant drawing flak from people.The restaurant, however, claimed the incident was misrepresented and said the establishment believed in "honouring our Indian community and have always welcomed our guests in all dress codes from modern to traditional".In a Facebook post, Anita Choudaary alleged she was not allowed to enter the Aquila restaurant at Ansal Plaza here on Sunday, because she was wearing a saree."In one of the restaurants in Delhi, saree is not considered to be a smart outfit. The restaurant's name is Aquila. We argued over saree, and a lot of excuses were made, but I was not allowed to enter the restaurant, because the Indian attire— saree is not a smart outfit," she wrote. "I have never been insulted like this. I also feel hurt."She also posted a purported video of her argument with the restaurant staff, alongside a couple of pictures of herself in the saree.Choudaary, according to her Facebook profile, is a creative director at Doordarshan National.Saree is not allowed in #Aquila restaurant as Indian Saree is now not an smart outfit.So by wearing saree women become dumb and socially unacceptable?pic.twitter.com/vnvCHCX8UjAfter her post went viral, the restaurant received heavy backlash with people calling the eatery out on social media as well as food aggregator platforms like Zomato.Responding to the allegations, the restaurant on Wednesday took to Instagram to clarify their side of the story.According to them, the "10-second" clip posted by Choudaary was part of a conversation that lasted for "one hour"."We chose to stay silent till now and have been patiently watching the situation related to the incident that took place at Aquila on September 19 unfold.A post shared by AQUILA (@aquila.delhi)"A guest visited the restaurant and was politely requested to wait at the gate as there was no reservation under her name. However, while we discussed internally as to where we could seat them, the guest entered the restaurant and began to fight and abuse our staff. What unfolded after was beyond our imagination, with the guest slapping our manager," the restaurant wrote on its Instagram post.It has also added CCTV footage of the incident, as well as a separate video where women wearing sarees are entering the restaurant.According to the restaurant, the comment on saree not being a "smart casual" outfit in the video shared by Choudaary was a way to "tackle" the situation."To tackle the situation and request the guest to leave, one of our gate managers made a statement on sarees not being a part of our smart casual dress code and our whole team apologises for the same," the statement said.Aquila went on to apologise for the remark."Aquila is a homegrown brand and each member of the team stands tall as a proud Indian. Our gate manager's statement in no way is a representation of the entire team's view on the dress code. Nowhere in our company policy does it say that we will refuse entry to anybody in ethnic wear."While we have all the right to take steps for the violence by the guest against our staff, we have chosen to maintain peace so far but in accordance with our policy of maintaining transparency with our stakeholders we are now issuing this statement," Aquila said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/viral-video-woman-claims-delhi-restaurant-refused-entry-as-she-was-wearing-saree-eatery-refutes-314744

TRS has filed a complaint against Reddy in the local court.In his petition, KTR said that Reddy made various slanderous and defamatory statements and allegations linking him with the ongoing investigation conducted by the ED.Hearing the matter, the judge passed an interim injunction restraining Reddy and his agents or any person representing him from “making any further derogatory, libellous or scandalous statements either by way of print or electronic media and in public or private including the social media and the internet, linking the minister with the ongoing investigation”.The matter will now come up on October 20. The civil suit was filed after Reddy challenged KTR to take up a white challenge (which proves that one is free from using any drugs) which led to the war of words between the leaders.

22-09-2021||Lucknow||Cleric arrested in UP for running ‘biggest conversion syndicate’||The Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) has arrested a cleric from Meerut for allegedly running a “biggest conversion syndicate”, a senior police official said here on Wednesday.Maulana Kaleem Siddiqui was arrested by the ATS, which is probing the racket, at around 9 pm on Tuesday from Meerut, Additional Director General (ADG), Law and Order, Prashant Kumar said.He was brought to the ATS headquarters here after being produced in a court, Kumar said.Following the arrest of Delhi’s Jamia Nagar residents Mufti Qazi Jahangir, Alam Qasmi and Mohammad Umar Gautam, who ran Islamic Dawah Center, an outfit allegedly working on the ISI funding for converting deaf-mute students to Islam, on June 20, the ATS is probing the conversion racket and has so far arrested 10 people besides Siddiqui, the official said.He said it came to light during the probe that Gautam and his accomplice were funded Rs 57 crore by Britain-based Al-Falaa Trust but the two did not give details of its expenditure.It was also found that Siddiqui is involved in the illegal conversion racket under the garb running various educational, social and religious organisations, Kumar said.“Foreign funding was done for this (conversion) in a big way and the illegal conversion was being carried out in a planned and organised way and many well-known and institutions are involved in it,” the ADG said.He said it also came to the fore that Siddiqui ran a “biggest conversion syndicate” and threatened and misled people for conversion and prepared them for ‘Dawah’ (the act of inviting or calling people to embrace Islam).The ATS found that he also runs Jamia Imaam Waliullah Trust, which is carrying out illegal religious conversion in the name of running “communal harmony” programmes, Kumar said.Siddiqui is a resident of Muzaffarnagar. After doing a BSc from Meerut, he cleared Pre Medical Test (PMT) but instead of pursuing MBBS he joined Nadwatul Ulema in Lucknow, he said.Siddiqui also funded madrasas and for this, he used to get huge money from abroad by illegal means, the ADG said.For conversion, Siddiqui’s self-written literature, which is available online as well as in print, was being given free of cost to people, he said.“He was trying to ensure that people believe that only shariyat arrangement could give justice to them. He used to emphasise that issues like Triple Talaq should be dealt under the light of shariyat,” the official said.Organisations that funded Gautam’s ventures also gave funds to the Siddiqui’s Trust, he said.The probe till now suggested that Rs 1.5 crore was transferred into the Trust account illegally from Bahrain and evidence of Rs 3 crore funding was found, Kumar said.He said six teams of the ATS are probing the case.A sign language expert working in the Union Ministry of Child and Family Welfare is among those arrested by the ATS for his alleged complicity in the religious conversion racket, according to officials.The deaf-mute sign language expert was identified as a Maharashtra native Irfan Khwaja Khan.The UP ATS arrests in the alleged conversion racket has also prompted the Enforcement Directorate to initiate a probe to investigate foreign funding and money laundering.Those arrested have been booked under relevant sections of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act, 2020 and the Indian Penal Code, as per the officials. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cleric-arrested-in-up-for-running-biggest-conversion-syndicate-314731

22-09-2021||New Delhi||Toolkit case: SC dismisses pleas of Chhattisgarh govt against relief granted to ex-CM Raman Singh, Sambit Patra||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to entertain two separate appeals of the Chhattisgarh government against orders of the high court granting a stay on investigation in an FIR registered against senior BJP leader and former chief minister Raman Singh and the party spokesman Sambit Patra for their tweets in connection with the alleged fake toolkit case.“Let the Chhattisgarh High Court decide the case. We know that in the entire country, there are people in different courts for stay, etc., in this toolkit business. Why should we give separate preference to this case,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana told senior advocate A M Singhvi who appeared for the Congress-led Chhattisgarh government to assail the high court’s relief granted to the two BJP leaders.The Chhattisgarh High Court on June 11 had passed two separate orders and granted interim reliefs in the same FIR lodged against Singh and Patra while noting that averments in the FIR reflected that “by the tweets, Congressmen are aggravated which clearly indicates that no public peace or tranquillity is being adversely affected and it is purely political rivalry between two political parties”.As soon as the hearing commenced, the Bench, also comprising justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, expressed its views saying that the high court be allowed to decide the pleas of the BJP leaders in the criminal case.Referring to the findings of the high court, Singhvi, assisted by lawyer Sumeer Sodhi, said, “What will the high court decide at this stage, look at the observations. Even if I go there, I must have a genuine hearing”.The high court said the petitioners are political persons and recorded the findings that no case is made out, he said, adding, “Now what is left for me to go back for.”               The Bench, however, said: “Don’t waste your energy here. We are not inclined to interfere. Let the High Court decide the matter expeditiously. The SLPs (special leave petitions) are dismissed. Let the observations not come in the way of deciding the case on merits.”    The apex court requested the Chhattisgarh HC to decide expeditiously the pleas related to the fake toolkit case.Earlier, the state government, through lawyer Sumeer Sodhi, had moved the top court against the high court orders granting stay of investigation in an FIR registered against the BJP leaders.The high court had said it was “prima facie established that present FIR has been registered with political motives”.In its appeal against the order in Raman Singh case, the state government said that on June 11 at the stage of admission, the high court vide the impugned order not only admitted the frivolous petition but also erroneously granted an interim relief sought by the accused/ Respondent number 1 (Raman Singh) by staying the investigation arising out of the FIR.It sought setting aside of the orders on the ground that the top court has time and again held that extraordinary powers of the high court under Article 226 of the Constitution ought to be used sparingly and in rarest of rare cases.The state government has further said that the high court erred in exercising such powers and staying the entire investigation as a nascent stage especially when ex-facie offence of forgery is made out and is writ large.It said the state has been carrying out an investigation in accordance with law and considering the pandemic, has been fair in its conduct and the accused was given an opportunity to be present at his own house as per the notice sent to him and when the second notice was sent to him, he was given an option to be present through his lawyer.The high court completely overlooked these aspects while returning a finding against the state government that the FIR has been lodged with “political motives”, it said.The state government further said that the defence of the accused ought not to be looked at the stage of quashing; however, in the present case the high court seems to have been wrongly swayed by the submission of the accused that he was not the author of the document and further that one “Team Bharat” was the actual author of the document.It said that the impugned order is ex-facie illegal, perverse and in stark derogation of the settled principles of law vis-à-vis the powers of the High Court to interfere at the nascent stage of investigation, therefore, deserves to be set aside.The state government took similar grounds in the appeal filed in the case of Sambit Patra and sought setting aside of the order.It has in interim sought an ex-parte stay of ad-interim orders granting stay of the impugned order dated June 11 passed by the High Court.On May 19, an FIR was lodged based on the complaint of Akash Sharma, the president of the National Students’ Union of India’s (NSUI) Chhattisgarh unit, with the allegation that Singh, Patra and others had circulated fabricated content on social media platforms using a fake letterhead of the Congress by projecting it as a toolkit developed by the party.

Therefore, we have sought certain directions,” senior advocate R Basant, appearing for the committee had said.

Other times, he would lurk in the park adjoining the Metro station or at Ambedkar Nagar bus stand on Mehrauli-Badarpur (MB) Road, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said.After snatching valuables from his victims, he would usually shout “Pakdo-pakdo” or “Chor-chor” to give an impression that he was chasing the culprit and would run like a trained athlete, he said.Thakur said that for more than a month, his team scrutinised hundreds of CCTV footage and analysed the timings and specific area of incidents to nab the suspect.Based on a tip-off, the team laid a trap on the MB Road in Neb Sarai area. “Finding himself trapped, the accused took out his country-made pistol but the police personnel overpowered him and snatched the firearm from his hand,” he said.After his arrest, Harish disclosed that he had sold three snatched gold chains to a goldsmith in Sangam Vihar area.

22-09-2021||Prayagraj||'Morphed photo with woman' emerges in Narendra Giri's 'suicide' case||Investigations into the 'mysterious' death of Akhara Parishad chief Mahant Narendra Giri are slowly opening up a can of worms that also reveal the ugly underbelly of the religious destinations.In a 'suicide' note, parts of which are almost illegible, the Mahant had stated that he was being blackmailed by Anand Giri who had morphed his photograph with a girl.The seer said that he had received information that Anand Giri had morphed the photograph on his computer and preparing to release it in the public domain soon."Anand even asked me that once these allegations spread, how many people will you prove your innocence to? I have lived a life of dignity and I cannot live with the humiliation that I will be subjected to" Narendra Giri had said in the suicide note, which was found in Bhagambari Mutt.Top police officials, however, are denying this angle that could have led to the mysterious death of the seer.Anand Giri has now been arrested for abetment of suicide and is being interrogated.Two others named in the suicide note- Adya Tiwari and his son Sandeep Tiwari- are also in police custody.Additional DG (Prayagraj zone) Prem Prakash has formed an 18-member SIT to conduct investigations into Giri's death.However, seers in Prayagraj and Haridwar now alleged that his death was the result of a "conspiracy" by those who were angry with him over a series of controversial decisions he had made as Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) chief."It is unlikely that there are just one or two people behind his death. There are many who were upset by decisions he made since he took over as Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad head in 2016," said a seer.In 2017, Narendra Giri had come out with a list of fake ascetics, angering many."Such hypocrite babas should be put in prison. Their assets must be investigated," he had said.The development had sent ripples within the sadhu community across the country. He had announced another list with the names of more fake sadhus two months later, in December.In 2019, Narendra Giri was accused in connection with the murder of Ashish Giri, secretary of Panchayati Akhara at Daryaganj (Allahabad), over a property dispute.Ashish was found dead in mysterious circumstances and later, police investigations gave a clean chit to Narendra Giri.Narendra Giri had also angered a section of seers during Kumbh 2021 when he refused to give ABAP recognition to the transgender Akhara, introduced for the first time in the festival."Giri had many differences with many people. The blackmail theory cannot be disregarded. Apart from Anand Giri, there are many influential people behind this which needs to be investigated," said a disciple at the Baghambari Mutt.Mortal remains given samadhiThe mortal remains of Mahant Narendra Giri were placed in a 'samadhi' in the premises of the Baghambari Mutt on Wednesday, amidst chanting of mantras in the presence of scores of saints and seers.The 'samadhi' was placed under a lemon tree, as desired by the deceased saint.Earlier, the mortal remains of the Mahant were taken in a procession to Sangam for the last holy bath. A huge crowd turned out along the route to pay last respects to the seer.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/morphed-photo-with-woman-emerges-in-narendra-giris-suicide-case-314696

22-09-2021||Vijay Mohan||Suryakiran: Flying formation that dazzles the skies with loops, rolls and dives||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 22Streaking through the blue skies with blazing contrails just a few hundred feet above the ground, the tight formation of brightly painted red and white Hawk trainer jets of the Indian Air Force is an exhilarating sight as they execute a series of loops, barrel rolls and other breathtaking aerial manoeuvres.The famed Suryakiran Formation Aerobatic Team (SKAT) is in Chandigarh once again to display its flying skills as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations of the Chandigarh Air Force Station that was established in 1961.The team, considered among the top three nine-aircraft aerobatic formations in the world, has left audiences across the country as well as in several countries, spellbound with its performance. Nine is the highest number of aircraft in an aerobatic team anywhere.But behind the glamour and glitz of close formation flying – the ultimate test of a fighter pilot’s abilities of concentration, coordination and unflinching nerves—lies a tough regimen of careful selection, extensive training, diligence and spectacular teamwork. In addition is the meticulous technical evaluation of its all manoeuvers and flying procedures that have to be ratified and approved by the IAF’s Tactics and Air Combat Development Establishment before they can be put into practice.To be a member of the SKAT, volunteers must be fighter pilots, have eight years of service and a minimum of 1,000 hours of flying and be qualified flying instructors. Volunteers are invited to fly with the team, where their performance and personality traits are evaluated. Over the next six months or so, selected pilots then fly 70-75 sorties practising various manoeuvres before they get into the formation flying team.Pilots have a tenure of about three years with the team. Generally, two new pilots join the team every six months. Starting off at high altitude with a single aircraft sortie, flying with the team leader or the deputy team leader, the fresh inductee moves on to two-aircraft and then three-aircraft formation flying. After mastering the skill of flying with two aircraft on either side, the fresher then goes in for four-aircraft and six-aircraft sorties before finally graduating to nine-aircraft sorties. All types of rolls, loops, dives and formations are flown at various training stages.In close formation flying, there is no margin for error, especially at low levels. The displays are performed in the height band of 30 m to 1,200 m at an average speed of 550 km per hour, which requires a high degree of maturity, skills and discipline among the aircrew. The manoeuvres can be in the vertical plane or the horizontal plane depending on the visibility, cloud cover and terrain.Formation aerobatics is not new to the IAF. As early as 1944, the IAF had a display flight and later a few ad hoc teams carried out aerobatic displays on special occasions such as the Air Force Day parade and firepower demonstrations. One such team consisted of four MiG-21s, called the Red Archers. The precision and spectacle of these teams were comparable to those of display teams from elsewhere. For the Aero India 2001, a special Mirage 2000 aerobatic team was formed.During the golden jubilee year of the IAF in 1982, handpicked fighter pilots from various squadrons formed an aerobatic team for the IAF called ‘The Thunderbolts’. Flying blue and white Hunter fighter bomber, this team captivated audiences for about a decade and it gave its last public display in 1989.The experience gained from the Thunderbolts was put to good use by a four-aircraft team called the Formation Aerobatic Team, set up in Bidar in 1990 on Kiran-II trainers. Though the team did not give any public displays, it ensured that formation aerobatic skills were maintained in the IAF.In early 1996, serious planning began for AVIA-96, the first major air show and aviation trade event ever hosted in India. The organisers’ initial intention was to invite an aerobatic team from overseas, but some senior IAF officers were confident that the world’s fourth largest air force would be able to field its own team. This formed the genesis of the present team, the Suryakiran, meaning rays of the sun.In May 1996, Wg Cdr Kuldeep Malik, who as a Flight Lieutenant had been a member of the ‘Thunderbolts’, and then serving as an instructor at the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington, was moved to Bidar, with instructions to raise a new aerobatic team. The pioneer team comprised Sqn Ldr AK Murgai, Sqn Ldr VK Khorana, Sqn Ldr S Prabhakaran, Sqn Ldr AR Gore, Sqn Ldr RK Obheroi, Sqn Ldr N Kanitkar, Sqn Ldr PK Vohra, Flt Lt T Sharma, Flt Lt K Prem Kumar and Flt Lt KK Dubey.During these early months the team flew overtime, graduating from aerobatics in four-aircraft ‘box’ formation to six-aircraft in ‘shockwave’ formation. The first six-aircraft formation took wings on August 8, 1996. There were two manoeuvres which the team finally managed to get through with a little bit of trouble. The first was the ‘goblet’ roll and the other the ‘tango’ roll — the latter incidentally was a historic first for the IAF because even the famed Thunderbolts did not do this manoeuvre.Soon the SKATs were tasked to carry out their first public display — a flawless six-aircraft display for the golden jubilee celebrations of Air Force Administrative College, Coimbatore, on September 15, 1996.In 1998, with Wg Cdr AK Murgai as the CO, the team expanded to a nine-aircraft formation. Considering the team was just two years old, it was no small achievement. The team first displayed a formation of nine-aircraft during the Independence Day flypast over the Red Fort in 1998. The first full-fledged nine-aircraft aerobatic display was to follow at Palam on October 8, 1998, to mark Air Force Day.In recognition of its performance and its role as brand ambassadors of the IAF, the SKAT became the first Air Force unit to be awarded the Chief of Air Staff Unit Citation, which it received on October 8, 2004.On May 1, 2006, the team was conferred with Squadron status after completion of one decade of precision flying. No 52 Squadron, The Sharks, an erstwhile MiG-21 Type 77 squadron, the IAF’s youngest flying unit that had been raised in January 1986, was reformed with the SKAT on the indigenously developed HJT-16 Kiran Mark-II jet trainers. The squadron’s motto ‘Sadaiva Sarvōttama’, translated as ‘Always The Best’ is an intrinsic part of the Suryakiran’s ethos.Due to a shortage of training resources, the Suryakiran team officially wound down in 2011, with Aero India being the last event. The team then flew into the sunset in the wake of flawless displays, the last of which was in the evening of February 13.The Suryakiran team rose again on February 16, 2015, when the unit was resurrected on the newly inducted British-made Hawk jet trainer aircraft at the fighter training town of Bidar in north Karnataka, the alma mater of all IAF fighter pilots. It had also been home to the Suryakiran team since 1996.Incidentally, the first trip abroad post-resurrection was to Sri Lanka in March 2021 for the 70th anniversary of the Sri Lankan Air Force, exactly 20 years after the team’s very first foreign tour. The first had been to the same country in March 2001 for the 50th anniversary of the Sri Lankan Air Force.SKAT currently operates the Hawk Mk-132, an advanced jet trainer designed by BAE Systems in the United Kingdom and license-produced in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. The aircraft was formally inducted into the IAF in February 2008, and is used to train all budding fighter pilots. The aircraft is powerful and agile with modern avionics and has the capability to carry about 3,000 kg of bombs, rockets and missiles along with a 30 mm cannon. It has a top speed of Mach 1.2.The Suryakiran Formation Aerobatic Team is at present commanded by Group Captain Anoop Singh, a Jaguar pilot decorated with the Vayu Medal for gallantry. There are 16 other officers on its posted strength, including three engineering officers, a medical officer and a woman officer who is the squadron’s adjutant, responsible for administration. The maximum number of pilots is from the Sukhoi-30 MKI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/suryakiran-flying-formation-that-dazzles-the-skies-with-loops-rolls-and-dives-314685

22-09-2021||---||Pakistan denies hand in cancellation of SAARC ministerial||New Delhi, September 22An in-person SAARC ministerial planned on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York this Saturday has been cancelled due to a “lack of concurrence from all member states”, said SAARC chair Nepal in an official communication.The media here quoted unnamed sources as stating that it was because of Pakistan’s insistence on having the Taliban represent Afghanistan at the Foreign Ministers’ Ministerial but this was not acceptable to most countries. The Taliban recently named Suhail Shaheen as its Permanent Representative to the UN.But Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Asim Iftikhar Ahmad said social media posts from some Indian journalists attributing the cancellation of the proposed informal SAARC ministerial meeting to Pakistan are “completely baseless and misleading”.The Taliban is understood to have applied to the UN administration to represent Afghanistan in a process called “request for credentials”. This process takes time and is unlikely to be completed during the ‘High-Level Week’ though it is possible a decision may be taken within the timeframe of the broader General Assembly that goes on for some three months, said a US State Department official during a briefing. “I don’t expect this issue to be resolved within the High-Level Week. But watch this space,” he said.However, Indian media and posts by social media influencers insisted that at an informal meeting, SAARC member states did not accept Pakistan’s request to allow the Taliban to represent Afghanistan.SAARC has been in limbo since 2016 when India decided to boycott the summit planned to be held in Islamabad. Following India's announcement, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Bhutan had also pulled out, depriving Pakistan the opportunity to take over from Nepal which, by default, has become the longest running chairmanship of SAARC.A week back, the Ministry of External Affairs was uncertain whether a SAARC ministerial would be held on the sidelines of the UNGA. The MEA spokesperson cited several reasons why it was not possible to commit to the SAARC ministerial. These included lack of information whether all ministers would be present at UNGA on the same day but “the chair [Nepal] will decide about Afghanistan’s participation”, he had said in response to a question.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-denies-hand-in-cancellation-of-saarc-ministerial-314675

Manjari Tripathi, Neurologist at AIIMS, DelhiThe Government data of Alzheimer’s Disease, the commonest form of dementia, shows a three-fold rise in the prevalence of cognitive decline over 1990, signaling the urgent need to address risk factors for the chronic neurodegenerative disease which leaves patients and families broken on account of the massive psychological and medical costs.As Indians age successfully with advancements in medical science, experts say it’s urgent to build individual cognitive reserves from an early age to fight dementia.Leading neurologist with AIIMS New Delhi Manjari Tripathi says 35 pc of dementia is attributable to a combination of modifiable risk factors which can be addressed at early stages.“From a young age itself we need to work on our cognitive reserves. Cognitive reserve is the ability of the brain to resist disease by modifiable life experiences so that we can push back dementia by several years. This reserve can be built by avoiding smoking, alcohol, eating healthy, consuming unsaturated oils, nuts, green leafy vegetables, taking regular walks, avoiding sugar and too much protein and practicing small meals and intermittent diet,” advises Tripathi.The expert says engagement in brain games and avoiding long hours before the computer are avoidable risk factors.Research has further revealed that neurotic personalities are more prone to cognitive decline and it pays to keep the mind calm with meditation. Western countries, Tripathi notes, have reduced the burden of Alzheimer’s by implementing lifestyle changes.On the research front, dementia – an umbrella term for degenerative diseases -- most common being Alzheimer's Disease – remains a very complex disease with scientists still studying the triggers.“Currently about every seven seconds there is one case of dementia and one person will develop major cognitive decline because we are aging successfully. We are still learning about the disease. What we know is it leads to shrinking of the brain memory cells and has two main causes -- non-modifiable (genes and age) and modifiable,” says Tripathi, associated with the Delhi chapter of Alzheimer’s and Related Disorders Society of India.Experts also call for reading the early warning signs of dementia that start with small memory lapses and changes in the ability to discharge normal activities and tasks like reading, writing and comprehending.“We want to pick up a patient early where mild memory and behavior changes are visible. At that stage we can help more by stemming some level of progression,” Tripathi says.Experts also call for policy makers to create awareness on the need for advanced directives and living wills by the elderly in India. Evidence shows huge implications of Alzheimer’s Disease among Indian patients because often the elderly have the money in their bank accounts but they have forgotten to read, write and sign because of the disease. Advanced directives and living wills can aid the autonomy of patients, experts note.World Alzheimer’s Day is observed on September 21 every year.The government data of Alzheimer’s disease, the commonest form of dementia, shows a three-fold rise in the prevalence of cognitive decline in 30 years (from 1990 to 2020), signalling the urgent need to address risk factors for the chronic neurodegenerative disease which leaves patients and families broken on account of the massive psychological and medical costs.As Indians age successfully with advancements in medical science, experts say it’s urgent to build individual cognitive reserves from an early age to fight dementia.Leading neurologist with AIIMS, New Delhi, Manjari Tripathi says 35 per cent of dementia is attributable to a combination of modifiable risk factors which can be addressed at an early stage.“From a young age itself, we need to work on our cognitive reserves.

22-09-2021||New Delhi||Quad to take on many challenges: Biden at UNGA||US President Joe Biden mentioned Quad and India during his 33-minute speech on the opening day of the UN General Assembly’s debate. “We elevated the Quad partnership among Australia, India, Japan and the US to take on challenges ranging from health security to climate to emerging technologies,” he said while sidestepping any mention of China, the singular reason for the alliance.In a hint at China, he, however, said the US was not seeking a new cold war and was ready to work with any nation that pursued peaceful resolutions. He promised to return to a full nuclear deal, if Iran did the same. Paying homage to 13 US Marines who died in the Kabul airport attack, Biden declared that “those who commit acts of terrorism against us will find a determined enemy in the US”. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quad-to-take-on-many-challenges-biden-at-unga-314398

Ministry of DefenceIn an affidavit filed in the apex court, the Ministry of Defence said a notification allowing women candidates to take the entrance exam for entry into the NDA will be released in May 2022.On September 8, the Centre had told the top court that it had decided to allow women cadets into the NDA, which was hitherto open to men alone. However, it had sought an exemption from implementing the decision for this year’s examination scheduled for November 14 as certain procedural and infrastructural changes would be needed before the entry of women cadets into the NDA.The decision followed the top court’s August 18 interim order that said debarring women amounted to gender discrimination. It had directed the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to issue an appropriate notification, taking into account its order and give it due publicity.The NDA entrance exams are held twice a year and the government proposes to have necessary mechanisms in place by May 2022, the time by which the UPSC is required to publish the first notification next year, for the exam. A Bench led by Justice SK Kaul is expected to consider the MoD affidavit on Wednesday.Placing on record its “clear and categorical stand” that the women candidates shall be considered for entry in the three Defence Services, in the existing streams, through the NDA, the Centre said a study group had been constituted by the Defence Services, comprising experts to expeditiously formulate the comprehensive curriculum for women cadets at the NDA.A Board of Officers had also been convened to give a holistic and futuristic proposal for training of women cadets at the NDA, incorporating all relevant aspects, it submitted.Noting that any dilution of physical training and service subject such as firing would invariably impact the battle worthiness of the armed forces adversely, it said, therefore, facilities such as equitation, swimming, games and sports were needed to be developed for the women candidates.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/womens-nda-entry-not-this-year-govt-314412

Mahesh Palawat of Skymet said the trend (of late retreat) being observed in the past couple of years was continuing this year as well.Notably, just last year, the withdrawal date was revised to September 17 by the IMD.The prolonged active spell has certainly helped reduce the rain deficit. The country is only 3 per cent short of the long period average (LPA).The Northwest, which was supposed to receive “below normal” rains in September, as per the IMD, is just seven per cent short and stands in the “normal category” of rains. Between June 1 and September 21, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi received 21 per cent more rains than the LPA and is in the “excess” category of rains.Punjab, with a 13 per cent deficiency, is also in the “normal” category, according to the IMD. Western UP (minus 22), J&K and Ladakh (minus 28) are the two sub-divisions in the “deficit category” in the Northwest.According to the experts, the regular formation of convective systems over the Bay of Bengal and their movement over central and north-western parts are among the reasons for its extended stay. Currently, the monsoon trough is lying south of its normal position and is likely to remain there during next five days, says the IMD.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rains-overstay-again-retreat-expected-in-october-314415

(IRCTC) fixed a bug on its e-ticketing platform after a plus two student from the city raised an alarm over the presence of Insecure direct object references (IDOR) -- a type of access control vulnerability in the booking site.The IT wing of the IRCTC which took note of the complaint, immediately resolved the vulnerability issue that has been reported, a senior official said on Tuesday.“Our e-ticketing system is well protected (now). The issue was reported on August 30 and it was fixed on September 2,” he added.The IDOR, a type of access control vulnerability, arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly.“I accidently discovered a critical IDOR that leaks the transaction details of millions of travellers, when I was trying to book tickets on August 30. It was the most common bug. Immediately, I reported about it to the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In),” P Renganathan, a plus two student of a private school in Tambaram here, said.“I've discovered a critical IDOR that leaks the transaction details of millions of travelers. Go to your account ticket history, click on any ticket with burp suite turned on. Now change the transaction ID to gain access to another's tickets, you will get all the sensitive details. You can also cancel someone's ticket or do anything malicious,” he said in an email complaint to CERT-In, under the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.As a mitigation, Renganathan who identifies himself as ethical hacker and cyber security researcher, said the booked user and ticket should be validated so that no one else can access it except the booked user.On September 11, 2021, he received a mail thanking him for reporting the incident to CERT-In and also a confirmation that the “reported vulnerability has been resolved” by the authorities concerned.Renganathan, currently pursuing commerce group, has been acknowledged by LinkedIn, United Nations, BYJU's, Nike, Lenovo, Upstox for reporting security vulnerabilities in their web applications.Schools across Tamil Nadu re-opened only for classes ninth to twelfth on September 1. “I have opted for online classes owing to the pandemic,” he said.

India’s other vaccine, Covaxin, is not in the contention at all since it is yet to be recognised by the WHO.“Have raised the discriminatory nature of UK vaccine recognition for AstraZeneca but not Covishield. Discussions on, but if they do not satisfy us, we would be well within our rights to take reciprocal action,” observed Shringla.Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said he had cancelled a visit to Britain as it is “offensive to ask fully vaccinated Indians to quarantine”.“The non-recognition of Covishield is a discriminating policy and impacts our citizens travelling to the UK. The EAM has raised the issue strongly with the new UK foreign secretary,” said Shringla at a press conference on Wednesday.“I am told that certain assurances have been given that this issue would be resolved,” he added while a British High Commission spokesperson here said it is engaged with the Indian Government on expanding UK recognition of vaccine certification issued by a “relevant public health body in India”.The basic issue, said Shringla, is that Covishield is a licensed product of a UK company manufactured in India. Moreover, India supplied 50 lakh doses of this very vaccine to the UK at the request of its government.What do new restrictions mean to Indian travellersAccording to new rules, Indian travellers who have received both doses of the Covishield vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) will be considered unvaccinated and will have to undergo self-isolation for 10 days.From October 4, the current "traffic light system" of red, amber, green countries based on levels of Covid risk will be replaced by one red list of countries.The scrapping of the amber list, which is what India is currently on, means a reduced PCR test cost burden only for some travellers.The expanded list of countries whose vaccines are recognised in the UK does not include India.It means Indians vaccinated with Covishield, the SII-produced Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, would be required to undergo compulsory PCR tests as well as self-isolation.
