The primary treatment for humans is supportive care.“It can be passed on to humans from contaminated food and directly from human-to-human,” warns the ministry. Fever, dizziness, headache, muscle pain, nausea, breathing complication and tonsillitis are the symptoms of NIV infection and its infection rate is relatively high.   Properly cleaning fruits before consuming, eating only well-cooked vegetables, keeping cowsheds and farms clean, use of gloves and masks during animal slaughtering and cooking meat, drinking boiled water, washing hands with soap and water time and again and using of mask in public are recommended as preventive measures against the virus. According to the ministry, the fatality rate of NIV is 45 to 75 per cent. The WHO recognises NIV-caused illness as one of 10 deadly diseases in the world. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-issues-alert-against-possible-spread-of-nipah-virus-from-india-310618
13-09-2021||New Delhi||Court commits Chhatrasal Stadium murder case against Sushil Kumar to sessions court||A Delhi court on Monday committed the Chhatrasal Stadium murder case, involving Olympic medallist wrestler Sushil Kumar, to the Sessions court for further hearing after taking cognisance of the charge sheet filed against him and others for the offences of murder, kidnapping and conspiracy.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) Satvir Singh Lamba of Rohini court has committed the case to the Sessions court, but whom it will be listed before is yet to be decided, the counsel for Sushil Kumar said, adding that the next date of hearing is September 24.Kumar, along with several other accused, was produced before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate through video-conference in the morning.They were asked to mark their attendance. Kumar is currently lodged in Tihar jail.The Olympic wrestler and others had allegedly assaulted former junior national wrestling champion Sagar Dhankar and his friends at the stadium on the intervening night of May 4 and 5 over an alleged property dispute.Dhankar succumbed to the injuries later. According to the post-mortem report, he died due to the “cerebral damage resulting from blunt object impact”.On August 3, the Delhi Police filed a charge sheet in the murder case, in which it named the Olympic wrestler as the main accused. The judge took the cognizance of offences in the final report on August 6.The police said the brawl at the stadium was the result of a conspiracy hatched by Kumar, who wanted to re-establish his supremacy among younger wrestlers.In the charge sheet, the police relied on the oral dying declaration of the deceased, scientific evidence including locations of the accused, CCTV footage, weapons, and vehicles recovered from the spot.Delhi Police had filed an FIR against the accused for offences such as murder, attempt to murder, culpable homicide, criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, robbery, rioting, among others.The Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) divides criminal trial into sessions trial and magistrate trial. The sessions court tries serious offences. If the offences are triable exclusively by the session court, the magistrate commits the case to it after taking cognisance of the charge sheet.

13-09-2021||New Delhi||Covid-19: SC asks Centre to reconsider decision to exclude compensation for those who died by suicide||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to reconsider its decision to exclude from its guidelines compensation to persons who committed suicide after being diagnosed with Covid-19.A bench of Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that it did not prima facie agree with the exclusion of such persons from the purview of compensation.The top court was considering the fresh guidelines issued by the Centre to simplify the process of issuance of death certificates, as per the directions in the judgment delivered on June 30.The apex court asked the Solicitor General about the persons who committed suicide while they were suffering from coronavirus.The bench said that exclusion of suicides where Covid-19 was an accompanying condition cannot be prima facie accepted under the guidelines.“You have to reconsider this”, the top court said.Advocate Gaurav Bansal submitted that Centre’s decision to exclude suicide from Covid-19 deaths even if Covid-19 is an accompanying condition is irrational and arbitrary.“Recently National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (herein after referred as NIMHANS) also issued a Research  Study titled as “Suicide in the context of Covid-19 diagnosis in India: Insights and implications from online print media reports.”. The petitioner has learnt from the said NIMHANS Research Study that Covid-19 related suicide rates are well above the National Average Suicide Rate and as such there is an urgent need to address the same,” Bansal said in an affidavit.The Centre had earlier told the apex court that the health ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) have come out with guidelines for issuing “official documents” for Covid-related deaths.In an affidavit filed before the top court, the Centre had also submitted that the Office of the Registrar General of India on September 3 had issued a circular to provide a Medical Certificate of Cause of Death to the next of kin of the deceased.Deaths occurring due to poisoning, suicide, homicide and deaths due to accident, among others, will not be considered as Covid-19 deaths even if Covid-19 is an accompanying condition, the guidelines stated.“Covid-19 cases which are not resolved and have died either in hospital settings or at home, and where a Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD) in Form 4 and 4 A has been issued to the registering authority as required under Section 10 of the Registration of Birth and Death (RBD) Act, 1969, will be treated as a Covid-19 death,” according to the guidelines.The Registrar General of India will issue necessary guidelines to chief registrars of all states and union territories in this regard.In its June 30 verdict, the top court had also ordered steps to simplify guidelines for issuance and correction of death certificates/official documents, stating the exact cause of death, that is, “Death due to Covid-19” for enabling dependents to get benefits of welfare schemes.The top court”s verdict had come on two separate pleas filed by lawyers Reepak Kansal and Gaurav Kumar Bansal seeking directions to the Centre and the states to provide Rs four lakh as compensation to the families of coronavirus victims as provisioned under the Act.Four intervenors, who had lost their family members due to Covid have also moved the top court through advocate Sumeer Sodhi contending that there cannot be any discrimination in the amounts being paid by different states to family members of those, who had succumbed to the deadly infection. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-sc-asks-centre-to-reconsider-decision-to-exclude-compensation-for-those-who-died-by-suicide-310609
13-09-2021||Chennai||Madras HC orders all anti-Sterlite protest cases to be stopped||The Madras High Court on Monday directed the authorities concerned to drop all the cases registered against the protestors involved in the anti-Sterlite agitation in 2018, in which 13 persons were killed in alleged police firing, and ensure their future prospects.The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice TS Sivagnanam also orally observed that firing upon the innocent public was a scar on Indian democracy and it should not be forgotten.The protest might not have been legal or legitimate, but citizens could not be fired on behalf of a corporate body. The State should ensure that this kind of incident does not happen again, it added.The bench pointed out that the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), in its report, had made certain recommendations.When the matter came up on August 9, the court had directed NHRC to submit its report. Accordingly, the Commission submitted its report in a sealed cover to the bench today.“Since the report did not see the light of day or may not have been forwarded to the State, the recommendations have not been implemented. To the extent that the recommendations remain relevant and it may be possible to implement the same, all agencies should carry the matter forward.  Equally, as indicated in the affidavit filed by the NHRC, the cases against the protesters should be dropped and the institution of the cases should not stand in the way of the future prospects of any of the protesters to disqualify them from any employment or other opportunities that may be available,” the bench said.The bench was passing further interim orders on a PIL petition from Henry Tiphagne, Executive Director of People’s Watch, an NGO, on Monday.The PIL had contended that the NHRC was yet to disclose the contents of the report of its investigating team, which had conducted a probe at the site. The grounds for closing the case, taken up on its own, in its order was ill-advised and it must be reopened, the petitioner said. Accordingly, the matter was entrusted with the CBI.The investigation should be brought to its logical end as expeditiously as possible, to give a meaningful closure to the matter and the circumstances in which the firing had to be resorted to against unarmed citizens must come out in the report, the bench said.It noted that the NHRC had also suggested certain further measures, including enhancing the compensation to the families of those who died and to those who were severely injured and are impaired for life. The State should consider a realistic quantum of compensation for either category, apart from others who suffered injuries. The State is requested to play the real parental role in providing counselling and psychiatric assistance to the members of the bereaved families, if necessary, the bench said, adding that that the State must be seen to be with the families and not an adversary, despite whatever may have happened.“The State needs to walk the extra mile for such purpose and the learned Advocate-General is requested to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to assuage the feelings of the families of the victims,” the bench said and posted the matter to October 25.Protests by locals against Vedanta’s copper unit Sterlite in Tuticorin over pollution concerns peaked on May 22, 2018, leading to violence that resulted in 13 deaths in police firing. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/madras-hc-orders-all-anti-sterlite-protest-cases-to-be-stopped-310607
13-09-2021||New Delhi||SC dissolves marriage, says it appears there was crash landing at take-off stage itself||The Supreme Court on Monday dissolved an around two-decade-old marriage which was never consummated saying the couple never lived together even for a day and it appeared there was a “crash landing” at the take-off stage itself.The apex court passed the decree of divorce dissolving the marriage not only in exercise of its plenary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution on account of irretrievable breakdown of marriage but also on account of cruelty under the provision of the Hindu Marriage Act in view of the conduct of the woman during the pendency of judicial proceedings.A Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy noted that endeavour to find a solution through mediation or any acceptable solution between the parties, who were married in February 2002, did not succeed.“It appears there was a crash landing at the take-off stage itself!” the Bench said in its verdict passed on a plea filed by the man.The man, who was working as an assistant professor, had told the apex court that the woman’s view was that she had been coerced into marrying him without her consent and she had left the marriage hall late at night.The Bench noted the conduct of the woman, who had resorted to filing multiple cases in courts against the man and also made representations to college authorities seeking initiation of disciplinary proceedings against him, and said these continuing acts would amount to cruelty.“The moot point is that the marriage has not taken off from its inception. There can hardly be any ‘wear and tear of marriage’ where parties have not been living together for a long period of time. The parties, undisputedly, never lived together even for a day,” it said, adding, “The marriage was never consummated and the parties have been living separately from the date of marriage for almost 20 years.”              The top court said under the Hindu law, marriage is sacramental in character and is supposed to be an eternal union of two people and the society at large does not accept divorce, given the heightened importance of marriage as a social institution in India.“Or at least, it is far more difficult for women to retain social acceptance after a decree of divorce. This, coupled with the law’s failure to guarantee economic and financial security to women in the event of a breakdown of marriage; is stated to be the reason for the legislature’s reluctance to introduce irretrievable breakdown as a ground for divorce – even though there may have been a change in social norms over a period of time,” the Bench said.It said a marriage is more than a seemingly simple union between two individuals and as a social institution, all marriages have legal, economic, cultural and religious ramifications.It said insofar as irretrievable breakdown of marriage is concerned, it does not exist as a ground of divorce under the Act and the issue has been debated by the Law Commission in its various reports.It noted that breakdown of marriage was considered by the Law Commission in its 59th report but the commission made no specific recommendations in this regard.It said in its 71st report, the commission departed from the fault theory of divorce to recognise situations where a marriage has completely broken down and there is no possibility of reconciliation and for such situations, it recommended that the law be amended to provide for irretrievable breakdown of marriage as an additional ground of divorce.“This recommendation was reiterated by the Law Commission in its 217th Report in 2010, after undertaking a suo moto study of the legal issues involved. So far, the Law Commission’s recommendations have not been implemented,” it said.The apex court said in 2010, the government introduced the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2010, which proposed to add irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a new ground for divorce in both the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and the Special Marriage Act, 1954.It noted that after receiving suggestions from relevant stake holders, the Bill was amended and reintroduced as the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2013, but it was never passed.The Bench said in appropriate cases, the apex court has granted decrees of divorce by exercising its jurisdiction under Article 142 to do complete justice between the parties.It noted that a reference on the issues, including what could be the broad parameters for exercise of powers under Article 142 to dissolve the marriage between consenting parties without referring them to family court to wait for the period prescribed under the provision of Hindu Marriage Act, is pending before its constitution bench.“Living together is not a compulsory exercise. But marriage is a tie between two parties. If this tie is not working under any circumstances, we see no purpose in postponing the inevitability of the situation merely because of the pendency of the reference,” it said.Dealing with the case, the Bench said it has little doubt that this is a marriage which has not worked and cannot work.“We are, thus, of the view that a decree of divorce dissolving the marriage between the parties be passed not only in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India on account of irretrievable breakdown of marriage, but also on account of cruelty under… of the Act in light of the subsequent conduct of the respondent (woman) during the pendency of judicial proceedings at various stages,” it said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-dissolves-marriage-says-it-appears-there-was-crash-landing-at-take-off-stage-itself-310605
13-09-2021||Chandigarh||Facing acute shortage, Armed Forces Tribunal gets six new judicial members||The central government has appointed six new judicial members to the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT), which has been facing critical shortage of judges for the past few years.The new members appointed this week include Justice Bala Krishna Narayana, Justice Shashi Kant Gupta, Justice Rajiv Narain Raina, Justice K. Harilal, Justice Dharam Chand Chaudhary and Justice Anjana Mishra.According to sources two of the newly selected AFT members are already serving in different organisations, reportedly due the delay in the selection process. The fresh appointments come about a year after appointments of seven judicial as well as administrative members were last made in September 2020.Close to 70 per cent of judicial and administrative posts in the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) are lying vacant, with almost 19,000 cases pending before its various benches across the country.Against the sanctioned strength of 34 judicial and administrative members only 11 are currently occupied, according to data placed before Parliament by the Ministry of Defence earlier this year.The AFT has 11 benches comprising 17 courts located in different parts of the country. Each court is held by a judicial member, who should have served as a judge of the High Court and an administrative member, who should have served as a senior officer of the armed forces or a person having such qualifications as notified by the government.The AFT is required to have 17 judicial members and an equal number of administrative members. The present strength, however, is only four judicial members, including the chairperson and six administrative members. The vacancies have resulted in several benches remaining non-functional.Established in 2009, the AFT’s mandate is jurisprudence over matters related to the commission, appointments, enrolments, and conditions of service in respect of persons subject to the Army Act, the Navy Act, and the Air Force Act, and hear appeals arising out of orders, findings or sentences of courts-martial and disciplinary proceedings.The Ministry’s data also showed that till February 28, 2021, a total of 18,829 cases were pending for disposal before its 11 benches. The highest pendency was before the Principal Bench at Delhi with 5,553 cases, followed by Chandigarh Bench with 4,512 cases and Jaipur Bench with 3,154 cases. Guwahati and Jabalpur benches had the lowest pendency with 104 and 347 cases, respectively.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/facing-acute-shortage-armed-forces-tribunal-gets-six-new-judicial-members-310603

13-09-2021||Kanpur (UP)||UP woman, raped repeatedly by traffic police constable, attempts suicide||A 25-year-old woman, who was allegedly raped repeatedly by a traffic police constable over the past two years, tried to commit suicide by jumping into the Ganga, police said on Monday.She was saved by divers and police personnel on Sunday evening, Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) Pramod Kumar said.A case has been registered in the matter on the basis of the woman’s complaint but no arrests have been made so far, the police said.The woman, a resident of Mirzapur district, alleged that her uncle who is a traffic head constable, had called her family to Allahabad in January 2019 to attend Kumbh.During her stay in Allahabad, her uncle took her to a hotel where he gave her a cold drink laced with sedatives and when she became unconscious, he raped her and made a video to blackmail her, the woman said in her complaint.She claimed that her uncle raped her several times in Allahabad and Kanpur over the past two years.When he learnt that the woman is pregnant, he allegedly gave her a pill to abort the pregnancy, the DCP said.On Sunday, the accused and his son took her to a room in the Chakeri area in Kanpur where they made another video of her to further blackmail her.When she resisted, they started to beat her up and threatened her with dire consequences, Kumar said.After escaping from their clutches, the woman made a call to the police helpline number and jumped into the river, but was saved by PRV personnel, the DCP said.A case under relevant sections of the IPC has been registered against the traffic police constable and his son but the two have not been arrested yet, Kumar said.DCP (Traffic) BBGTS Murthy said the constable would be placed under suspension after recording her statement before the magistrate.A medical examination of the woman would also be conducted to confirm the charges, he added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-woman-raped-repeatedly-by-traffic-police-constable-attempts-suicide-310586

13-09-2021||New Delhi||Tihar jail death: Delhi HC seeks report from prison authority on protection of witnesses||The Delhi High Court on Monday sought a status report from the prison authority on the steps taken to ensure the safety and security of witnesses in the alleged murder of inmate Ankit Gujjar in Tihar jail and directed that they be kept in a cell in an area under CCTV monitoring.Justice Mukta Gupta, who last week transferred the investigation from Delhi Police to the CBI, saying the deceased “lost his life to custodial violence”, also sought the medical report of two witnesses who were allegedly not receiving proper treatment in spite of suffering “grievous injuries” in the same incident of assault.The CBI counsel informed the court that it has registered an FIR into the investigation.Gujjar, 29, was found dead inside his cell in Tihar jail on August 4.“Director General (Prisons) will file a status report indicating measures taken to ensure the safety and security of petitioner 1 to 3 is being maintained and also on surrender, safety and security of petitioners 4 and 5 will also be maintained,” ordered the judge.“DG will also ensure that the petitioners 1-3, in custody, and petitioners 4 and 5, who will surrender on September 24, are kept inside an area where the CCTV is fully functional so that the ingress and egress to the cell is properly monitored.”The court was hearing a petition by the five witnesses seeking directions to ensure their safety and security as well as to restrain the authorities from “threatening/coercing/injuring them with a view to preventing them from seeking justice for themselves and the deceased inmate”.“The Petitioners are all inmates of Delhi Prisons and are eyewitnesses to the brutal murder of one Ankit Gujjar (deceased), by Respondent No.1 officials, inside Central Jail No.3 on 03.08.2021,” the petition reads.Two of the petitioners, it is claimed, were the co-inmates of the deceased who also victims of the same assault while the other three saw the public beating of the deceased and the events leading his death.Lawyer Mehmood Pracha, counsel for the petitioners, apprehended threat, injury, and pressure from officials to coerce them into changing their stand.Two of the petitioners, who were released on interim bail on the same day, informed the deceased family about the events that transpired in jail and they are scheduled to surrender on September 24, he said.“The sequence of events clearly demonstrates the existence of an imminent threat to the lives of the Petitioners on account of the fact that they are eyewitnesses to a gruesome and brutal murder inside the jail premises by influential and powerful jail officials, at the behest of the highest rung authorities of the administration,” the plea reads.In its order passed on September 8, the court had stated that the post-mortem report of the deceased “belies the version” of the jail officials that a scuffle took place in which both Deputy Superintendent and Gujjar received injuries.Saying that it is unfathomable that the jail doctor failed to see the multiple injuries on the deceased, the court opined that an investigation was needed into not only the offence of brutally beating the deceased but also into “the role of jail doctors in not providing proper treatment at the right time”.The court observed that the DIG Prisons “failed to notice the connivance/laxity” of the jail deputy superintendent who did not permit the local police to go inside the jail to inquire into the PCR call made in relation to the beating of the deceased on the intervening night of August 3-4.In the petition for transfer of investigation from Delhi Police, the family of the deceased inmate alleged that Gujjar was being harassed by the jail officials as he was “unable to meet their regularly increasing demands for money” and was murdered “as a part of the pre-planned conspiracy”.The matter would be heard next on September 27. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tihar-jail-death-delhi-hc-seeks-report-from-prison-authority-on-protection-of-witnesses-310580
13-09-2021||Aligarh (UP)||New university in Aligarh to be named after freedom fighter; meets local BJP’s 7-year-old demand||Seven years after the local BJP first demanded renaming the AMU after Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, who had donated the land for it, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Tuesday lay the foundation stone of a new university nearby in the freedom fighter’s name.Modi is scheduled to arrive in the city to lay the foundation of the Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh State University.Chief Minister Adityanath visited the venue on Monday to oversee the preparations for the event at Lodha town, about 40 km from the district headquarter of Aligarh.A controversy had erupted in the district in 2014 when local BJP leaders demanded the Aligarh Muslim University be renamed after him as the “AMU had been built on the land donated by the late Raja”.The issue first cropped up as the lease of the 1.2 hectares of land at the City School, under the AMU, was expiring then, and the legal heirs of the late Raja “were reluctant to renew this lease”.Last year, however, the issue had largely been resolved when the AMU authorities offered a proposal for rechristening the school after the late Raja.However, an AMU official told PTI on Monday: “Certain technicalities are still to be worked out”. The prime minister will also visit the exhibition models of Aligarh node of Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor and Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh State University.The new university, to be named after the noted freedom fighter who belonged to the district, also aims to fulfil a longstanding demand for a state university in the region. All the colleges in Aligarh division and some neighbouring districts will be affiliated to it, the chief minister had said recently.It is being set up in a total area of over 92 acres at village Lodha and village Musepur Kareem Jarouli of Aligarh’s Kol tehsil. Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh was an alumnus of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and was also the president of India’s first provisional government-in-exile established on December 1, 1915, in Kabul.Belonging to the royal family of Mursan, he had left his home and family in Aligarh in December 1914 and escaped to Germany and remained in exile for about 33 years as he was wanted by the British authorities.He returned in 1947 only after India gained independence. He was elected to Lok Sabha from Mathura in 1957, defeating the then Jan Sangh candidate Atal Bihari Vajpayee, contesting as an Independent.“Raja Mahendra Pratap is one of the most remarkable figures of India’s freedom movement and his commitment to the cause of a secular democratic India marks him as a giant of his times,” said noted scholar and political historian professor Shan Mohammad.     “His commitment to the cause of secularism is comparable to Gandhi’s and Nehru’s. He fully deserves to be honoured but his legacy should be fully respected,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-university-in-aligarh-to-be-named-after-freedom-fighter-meets-local-bjps-7-year-old-demand-310579

13-09-2021||New Delhi||NCLAT gets third Acting Chairperson in a row; no full-time head since March 2020||Justice M Venugopal has been appointed as the Acting Chairperson of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), as the key appellate tribunal continues to be without a permanent head now for more than one-and-a-half years.This is the third time in a row that an Acting Chairperson is at the helm of the NCLAT, which is handling several crucial appeals related to matters under the insolvency and competition laws, after the retirement of Chairperson Justice S J Mukhopadhaya on March 14, 2020.Last week, the Supreme Court raised its concerns saying the Centre was “emasculating” tribunals by not appointing officials to the quasi-judicial bodies that are facing staff crunch.According to the latest update on the website of the NCLAT, Justice Venugopal has been appointed as the Acting Chairperson of the appellate tribunal from September 11, 2021.He is a former judge of the High Court of Madras. He had joined as a Sub-Judge in Tamil Nadu State Judicial Service on June 5, 1997, and later was elevated to Madras High Court in November 2007, where he had served for eleven-and-a-half years.Justice Venugopal was appointed as a Judicial Member of the NCLAT on October 23, 2019, and was moved to the Chennai bench of the appellate tribunal on January 16, 2021.Justice Mukhopadhaya, who was the full-time Chairperson, retired on March 14, 2020, after serving as Chairperson of the appellate body for almost four years.Later, Justice Bansi Lal Bhat became the Acting Chairperson from March 15, 2020, and was given four extensions by the government till he attained the age of 67 years.Subsequently, the baton for officiating the appellate tribunal was handed over to Justice AIS Cheema, who was also on extension. He worked as an Acting Chairperson of NCLAT from April 19, 2021, and his last day at the appellate tribunal was September 10.Saurabh Kalia, Advocate and Secretary General of the NCLT Bar Association, said the situation at the NCLAT is critical.“Justice M Venugopal is the third acting Chairperson of the NCLAT. In the last 18 months, the NCLAT had three acting Chairpersons.“No permanent Chairperson has been appointed in the last 18 months which has led to serious hampering in the working of NCLAT. Even the strength of judicial members have gone down to three only, including the Chairperson to head the benches for both Principal Bench in Delhi as well as Chennai Bench,” he said in a statement.Kalia also said that frequent changes in the benches have delayed the disposal of matters which has not only caused hardship to the various litigants, financial institutions and lawyers but even to the benches as well as they have been burdened to hear the matters again and again.Amid the Supreme Court flagging concerns about the shortage of people at various tribunals, the government has appointed 31 members to the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) and the ITAT (Income Tax Appellate Tribunal).There are around 250 posts lying vacant at various key tribunals and appellate tribunals such as NCLT, Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT), Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) and Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT).On September 6, the Supreme Court said the Centre was testing its “patience” and “emasculating” tribunals by not appointing officials to the quasi-judicial bodies which are facing a severe crunch of presiding officers as well as judicial and technical members.While asserting that it did not want any confrontation with the government, a special bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana asked the Centre to make some appointments to the tribunals before September 13.Presently, the NCLAT like other judicial and quasi-judicial bodies is conducting virtual hearings of cases for its Delhi-based Principal bench and Chennai bench.The NCLAT was constituted under Section 410 of the Companies Act, 2013 for hearing appeals against the orders of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). It is also an appellate tribunal for hearing appeals against the orders passed by NCLT under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), and by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI).It is also the appellate tribunal to hear and dispose of appeals against any direction issued or decision made or order passed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nclat-gets-third-acting-chairperson-in-a-row-no-full-time-head-since-march-2020-310576

I hope they are satisfied with the answers,” he told reporters after the questioning.Chatterjee was allegedly seen in some of the public functions organised by the now-defunct I-Core which was charged with duping investors by offering them abnormally high returns on investments.Like Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund companies, I-Core raised money from the public by several fraudulent schemes floated by it.The economic offences wing of the CBI had asked Chatterjee to appear before its officials on September 13 at the CGO Complex office of the central agency.The TMC secretary general, however, pleaded that he be interrogated at his office since he is busy with other preoccupations, CBI sources said.Earlier, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had also served a notice to the minister in the same ponzi scam.The CBI had taken over the investigation of Saradha and other ponzi scam cases on the orders of the Supreme Court on May 9, 2014.

The rations of Kushinagar used to go to Nepal and Bangladesh. Today, if anybody tries to swallow the rations meant for poor people, he will land in jail,” the chief minister said.‘Abba jaan’ is an Urdu term for father.National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah took to Twitter on Sunday to criticise the chief minister’s remark.                                “I’ve always maintained the BJP has no intention of fighting any election with an agenda other than blatant communalism & hatred with all the venom directed towards Muslims. Here is a CM seeking re-election claiming that Muslims ate up all the rations meant for Hindus,” he said.Terming Adityanath’s remark “unparliamentary”, SP MLC Ashutosh Sinha said: “The use of unparliamentary language in the capacity of a chief minister does not suit him, and it shows that he is less educated. This is because those who are well-educated use proper and dignified language. A person who is occupying a Constitutional post should refrain from using such language. Use of such language is also sad for democracy”.                Uttar Pradesh Congress spokesperson Ashok Singh said: “The language used by the UP chief minister tarnishes democracy, and it is aimed at dividing the society”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/political-parties-criticise-adityanath-for-abba-jaan-remark-310565

The move assumes significance on the part of Switzerland as it is trying hard to re-position itself as a key global financial centre while warding off the long-persisting perception about the Swiss banking system being an alleged safe haven for black money.While the Swiss Government has agreed to share details of real estate assets, information on contributions to NGOs as also details on digital currency investments still remain out of bounds. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-get-3rd-set-of-swiss-bank-details-this-month-310273

He is a close confidant of former state Chief Minister Anandiben Patel.Bhupendra Patel met Gujarat Governor Acharya Devvrat this evening and staked claim to form the next government. Once he takes oath tomorrow, Gujarat will see its third CM in a span of five years (Anandiben resigned in August 2016, Vijay Rupani quit yesterday).A new Cabinet will also be formed. “Tomorrow only the CM will take oath. The ministers will be finalised by the BJP leadership soon,” said state BJP chief CR Paatil, crediting Patel’s “grassroots appeal” and hold in the cooperative sector for his selection over prominent names that were doing the rounds.The election of Patel signals the clout of Anandiben. She had her way today after being sidelined in the selection of her replacement in August 2016. Shah had prevailed at the time to get Rupani named as her successor causing much consternation.Both Shah and BJP chief JP Nadda congratulated Patel, who is so close to Anandiben that she got him nominated as party candidate from her assembly Ghatlodia in 2017. He won with the highest margin of nearly 1.17 lakh votes.Patel said he would “take Gujarat’s development agenda forward and complete unfinished tasks”. He also thanked the Prime Minister and skirted queries on proximity to Anandiben.Sources said Patel’s clout among Patidars was a major factor to win back the community support. With his appointment, the BJP thinks it has done enough to placate the politically and socially dominant Patidars, who were disenchanted with the party in 2017. The Patidars hold sway in around 80 of the Gujarat Assembly’s 182 segments.Factors behind change of guard||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-names-anandiben-loyalist-bhupendra-rajnikant-patel-as-gujarat-cm-310339

The leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 32 farm unions spearheading the protest, however, called it a temporary decline. “The farmers have gone home to take care of their paddy crop. They will start returning in a week,” claimed Harinder Singh Lakhowal, BKU (Lakhowal) general secretary.SKM leader Yogendra Yadav too called it an agriculture-based phenomenon. “They will be back soon. Moreover, our focus is on making the September 27 Bharat Bandh successful and streamlining campaign for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly poll,” maintained Yadav. Another union leader said nonetheless, they would plan a fresh strategy to revitalise the agitation, which will complete 10 months later this month.Sources said besides paddy, the thinning crowds could be attributed to “non-availability” of senior leaders at the protest sites. The veterans, the sources said, remained occupied with Muzaffarnagar ‘kisan mahapanchayat’ and the Karnal sit-in over the past fortnight while others were busy planning a strategy for the Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand Assembly elections.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha leaders last week asked the top politicians of various parties in Punjab to defer their political functions till the Assembly elections were announced so as to retain crowds at the protest sites. Besides, the morcha has asked its top leaders to convince more farmers to move to the Delhi border.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/crowds-at-singhu-tikri-thinning-as-protesting-farmers-head-home-ahead-of-harvesting-season-310337

A twin proposal is being examined at the level of the Department of Military Affairs headed by the Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat.The first is to standardise the age of retirement at level of Colonel, which varies in all three services, and second is the nature of work being handled by re-employed officers. In case of varying age of retirement, the Army retires Colonels at age of 54, the Navy retires Captains at 56 and the IAF has the retirement age of 57 in case of Group Captains. The plan is to standardise the retirement age across the three services as different set of rules cannot be applied. The second part is about the nature of the work being done by the re-employed officers. A retiring officer can seek employment for two years and a few do opt for it.On being re-employed, a Colonel is paid the salary of his rank, but is given the work-responsibility of a Major, two ranks below. Sources say the plan is to get the re-employed officer to do the task mandated at the level of Colonel. There is no logic in paying the salary of a Colonel to a reemployed officer and task him with a Major’s work, said a senior functionary.Varied norms in 3 services at present||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/common-retirement-age-at-colonel-level-mulled-310334

13-09-2021||Lucknow/Kolkata||TMC, other parties ridicule BJP over use of Kolkata flyover’s image in UP govt ad||The BJP’s rival parties on Sunday took a swipe at it over the use of a purported image of a Kolkata flyover in an Uttar Pradesh government advertisement on economic progress in the state under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, with the TMC claiming that it was an “acknowledgment” of the “great work” done by CM Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal.The Indian Express, which had carried the advertisement, had, however, issued a corrigendum saying the wrong image was inadvertently included in the cover collage of the advertorial produced by the marketing department of the newspaper.The advertisement titled “Transforming Uttar Pradesh under Yogi Adityanath” showed an image of a flyover painted in blue-and-white, colours synonymous with West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress, along with high-rises and industries juxtaposed below a cut-out of Yogi Adityanath.Transforming UP for @myogiadityanath means stealing images from infrastructure seen in Bengal under @MamataOfficial's leadership and using them as his own!Looks like the 'DOUBLE ENGINE MODEL' has MISERABLY FAILED in BJP’s strongest state and now stands EXPOSED for all! https://t.co/h9OlnhmGPw  “Before 2017, UP was not taken seriously with regard to investment, but in his four-and-a-half years rule, that negative perception has been broken and in 2020, it has emerged as the second-largest economy in the country,” the message in the advertisement read.TMC MPs such as Derek O’ Brien, Abhishek Banerjee, Mahua Moitra and Firhad Hakim ridiculed the BJP over the episode, claiming that the saffron party has now indirectly accepted the “development spree” under the Mamata Banerjee government and even tried to appropriate it.“The state government (of UP) has to be responsible, there is no passing the buck,” TMC national spokesperson and leader of the party in the Rajya Sabha Derek O’Brien said, claiming that the newspaper concerned was put under pressure to release a statement taking the blame for the goof up.O’Brien said he has been with an advertising agency for several years and can vouch that the client has to approve any advertisement before being released in the media.“This is a blunder. The only positive part of it is that they (BJP) are acknowledging the great work done by the Mamata Banerjee government in West Bengal,” he said at a press conference in Kolkata, adding, “Imitation is the best form of flattery.”   TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee tweeted:  “Transforming UP for @myogiadityanath means stealing images from infrastructure seen in Bengal under @MamataOfficial’s leadership and using them as his own! Looks like the ‘DOUBLE ENGINE MODEL’ has MISERABLY FAILED in BJP’s strongest state and now stands EXPOSED for all (sic)!” Reacting to the advertisement, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is touring UP, alleged that the BJP government is “making false claims of development by putting fake pictures of flyovers and factories”.“There is no understanding of the issues of the public nor there is any link with it. The government is only about making false advertisements and castles in the air,” she said in a Hindi tweet.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav alleged that till now the BJP government was “falsely publicising” the works of the SP government as its own.“The BJP must open an ‘International Institute of False Publicity’,” he tweeted in Hindi.In a jibe at the BJP, senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh tweeted: “Have never seen nor heard such development. The Kolkata flyover has been dragged to Lucknow by our Chief Minister Adityanath jee...”.Dismissing the criticism, UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi in a Hindi tweet said, “The newspaper @IndianExpress has itself accepted that there has been a mistake on the part of the newspaper’s marketing department, due to which the advertisement got published. However, we are not experts in advertising as the #AAP is.”The Indian Express, which had carried the advertisement, issued a corrigendum saying, “A wrong image was inadvertently included in the cover collage of the advertorial on Uttar Pradesh produced by the marketing department of the newspaper. The error is deeply regretted and the image has been removed in all digital editions of the paper.”Both, Additional Chief Secretary (Information) Navneet Sehgal and the Director of Information and Public Relations, Government of UP, Shishir retweeted the above corrigendum issued by the newspaper.The West Bengal BJP hit back at the Trinamool Congress saying even if the image was indeed that of Maa flyover, the TMC government does not have any other infrastructural development to flaunt.“Several expressways have been built under the Adityanath government in UP. In comparison, West Bengal has witnessed several flyovers collapsing in the last few years,” West Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu said.Even if it is indeed the image of Maa flyover, it was nothing but a mistake and does not take away Adityanath’s credit for accelerating UP’s growth, he said.Addressing the press conference, O’Brien, however, claimed that the TMC and Mamata Banerjee are the only serious challengers to the BJP in national politics and people believe that Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah can be defeated in the 2024 Lok Sabha election under her leadership.Stating that Yogi Adityanath, whose state Uttar Pradesh goes to polls in 2022, had addressed 11 rallies in West Bengal during the assembly elections held earlier this year, O’Brien claimed that his claims of the benefits of a “double engine government” (same party rule in Centre as well as state) have been proved to be hollow and false.

13-09-2021||New Delhi||Security forces to have training module on Taliban||Border forces and armed police units deployed in the counter-terrorism grid have been directed by the central security establishment to prepare and administer a new training module on the Taliban and its modus operandi to the troops in view of the “emerging” scenario following the Islamic militia taking over Afghanistan.Stating that the fall of Kabul to the Taliban last month may have a “serious bearing” on the security situation in India, the ground forces and their intelligence setup have been asked to update both their strategy, tactics and combat syllabus on the new “geo-political situation in central and south Asia and its grave security implication on India’s borders and the hinterland”.    The directive issued by the security establishment a few days back also envisages a scenario where infiltration from across the border from Pakistan on India’s west and illegal entry of terrorist operatives from open fronts in the east may increase including that by foreign terrorist fighters.Officials in the central security forces and intelligence wings acknowledged the new developments that have taken place in the neighbourhood after the Taliban swiftly took over almost all provinces of Afghanistan last month following the US military retreating from their 20-year war in that country launched after the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001 in their country.A senior officer told PTI that the existing training module of border guarding forces like the BSF and SSB, state police units and those involved in counter-terrorist duties like the CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir Police have an existing title “changing dynamics of border management”.“This included information on the Taliban as well but it was not updated. That is being added through open-source authentic information and others available in a classified manner to us and the focus is the developments of the last twenty years that took place in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks,” the officer said.A full-fledged training, intelligence and combat module on Taliban, its leadership and their modus operandi is being prepared apart from specific case studies that have taken place in that country and the region, he said.The directives have been forwarded to the central and state police forces which have multiple levels of training centres and academies to train their personnel and officers during induction and while in service.“It is very important for the last man standing at the border, a checkpost or under a police jurisdiction to know about the Taliban’s history and linked activities and strategies.“Senior and top commanders of the security forces may know most of the things about Afghanistan and Taliban situation but they draw their operational strength from the troops or the constable standing on the ground. They need to be informed well,” another senior officer working in the training management division of a paramilitary force said.At least one such session has been conducted in two central forces post the issuance of the new directives while a webinar for all these forces is being planned in a combined manner to be held later this month, a Union Home Ministry official said.A third officer said the latest directions make it clear that such sessions should also be held for the troops and commanding officers on the ground during “daily operational briefing sessions” in their area of deployment and case studies on the Taliban are being prepared in “local and vernacular languages” for the troops.The security forces are also enhancing their training quota of personnel for understanding IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and vehicle-borne IEDs (VBIEDs).“IEDs remain a constant threat to the security personnel and their operations everywhere be it anti-Naxal operations or counter-terrorist duties.“However, for those deployed in the Kashmir valley knowing IEDs and VBIEDs, their detection and crippling is very important post the Afghanistan development,” one of the officers cited above said and referred to the fatal and non-fatal casualties suffered by the NATO forces from IEDs in Afghanistan. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/security-forces-to-have-training-module-on-taliban-310171

Union of India and others, W.P.© No. 554 of 2021 and Gaurav Kumar Bansal v. Union of India and others, W.P.© No. 539 of 2021,” the court said.According to the guidelines, those Covid-19 cases would be considered which have been diagnosed through RT-PCR test, molecular test, rapid-antigen test or clinically determined through investigations at a hospital or in-patient facility by a treating physician, while admitted at the hospital or in-patient facility.Deaths occurring due to poisoning, suicide, homicide and deaths due to accident, among others, will not be considered as Covid-19 deaths even if Covid- 19 is an accompanying condition, the guidelines stated.“Covid-19 cases which are not resolved and have died either in hospital settings or at home, and where a Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD) in Form 4 and 4 A has been issued to the registering authority as required under Section 10 of the Registration of Birth and Death (RBD) Act, 1969, will be treated as a Covid-19 death,” according to the guidelines.The Registrar General of India will issue necessary guidelines to chief registrars of all states and union territories in this regard.According to an ICMR study, 95 per cent of deaths take place within 25 days of a person testing Covid-19 positive, it was mentioned in the guidelines.“To make the scope broader and more inclusive, deaths occurring within 30 days from the date of testing or from the date of being clinically determined as a Covid-19 case, will be treated as ‘deaths due to Covid-19, even if the death takes place outside the hospital/ in-patient facility,” the guidelines stated.However, a Covid-19 patient, while admitted at a hospital or in-patient facility, and who continued as the same admission beyond 30 days, and died subsequently, shall be treated as a Covid-19 death, according to the guidelines.The guidelines state that in cases where the MCCD is not available or the next of kin of the deceased is not satisfied with the cause of death given in the MCCD and which are not covered by the aforesaid scenarios, states and union territories shall notify a committee at the district level.The committee would consist of an additional district collector, the chief medical officer of health (CMOH), an additional CMOH/ principal or head of the department of medicine of a medical college (if one exists in the district) and a subject expert, for issuing of the “Official Document for COVID-19 Death”, the guidelines said.The guidelines also enumerate the procedure to be followed by the committee.The next of kin of the deceased shall submit a petition to the district collector for issuing of the document, it said.“The Official Document for Covid-19 Death will be issued in the format annexed to these guidelines by the aforesaid district-level committee after due examination and verification of all facts. The Official Document for Covid-19 death shall also be communicated to chief registrars of states/UTs and Registrar of Birth and Death, who issued the death certificates,” one of the guidelines said.The committee will also examine the grievances of the next of kin of the deceased, and propose necessary remedial measures, including issuance of amended “Official Document for Covid-19 Death” after verifying facts in accordance with these guidelines.The applications for issuing the document and for redressal of grievances shall be disposed off within 30 days of submission of the application/ grievance.In its June 30 verdict, the top court had also ordered steps to simplify guidelines for issuance and correction of death certificates/official documents, stating the exact cause of death, that is, ‘Death due to COVID-19’ for enabling dependents to get benefits of welfare schemes.The top court’s verdict had come on two separate pleas filed by lawyers Reepak Kansal and Gaurav Kumar Bansal seeking directions to the Centre and the states to provide Rs 4 lakh compensation to the families of coronavirus victims as provisioned under the Act.Four intervenors, who had lost their family members due to Covid have also moved the top court through advocate Sumeer Sodhi contending that there cannot be any discrimination in the amounts being paid by different states to family members of those, who had succumbed to the deadly infection. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-issues-guidelines-for-covid-death-certificate-after-scs-rebuke-310123
