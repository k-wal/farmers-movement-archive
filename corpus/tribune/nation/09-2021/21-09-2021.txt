21-09-2021||New Delhi||SC upholds PSPCL decision on captive coal block||The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the decision of the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) — now known as Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) — to select the lowest bidder DBL­VPR Consortium for supply of coal, saving crores of rupees for PSPCL.“A policy decision to get the best operator at the best price, cannot be said to be a decision which no reasonable person would take in his affairs,” a Bench of Justices LN Rao, BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna said.The top court said the PSPCL’s decision dated April 6, 2018, cannot be questioned on the ground of illegality or procedural impropriety. The decision was taken in accordance with Section 11 of the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 and after following the principle of natural justice, it added.“In the result, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana is unsustainable in law. The appeals are therefore allowed and the judgment and order passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana dated 25th January 2019, is quashed and set aside,” it said.The verdict came on appeals challenging the High Court’s order allowing the petitions filed by EMTA Coal Limited giving the first right of refusal in the matter of lending of coal mining lease to EMTA.“While exercising powers of judicial review, the court is not concerned with the ultimate decision but the decision-making process. The limited areas in which the court can inquire are as to whether a decision-making authority has exceeded its powers, committed an error of law or committed breach of principle of natural justice,” it said.The top court took note of the fact that PSPCL went for a competitive bidding process for the purpose of eliciting the best operator.It had also referred to its decision that held the allotment should be through a competitive bidding process.The PSEB — now known as PSPCL — was proposed to be allotted Captive Coal Mines by the Centre.Following issuance of a tender inviting bids for the purpose of development of Captive Coal Mines, ETMA Coal Limited emerged the winner. Following creation of a Joint Venture Company, the Centre on December 26, 2001 allotted a Captive Coal Block in Pachhwara (Central Block) Coal Mine, Jharkhand to PSEB.Until 2014, there was no problem. However, on August 25, 2014, the top court in ML Sharma’s case held that the entire allocation of Coal Blocks made between 1993 and 2011, except those which were made through competitive bidding, were invalid, unfair, and arbitrary. And on September 24, 2014, it quashed all Coal Block allocations made by the Central Government between 1993 and 2011.On March 31, 2015, the Centre again allocated Pachhwara Captive Coal Block in favour of PSPCL and PSPCL entered into a Transitory Agreement with EMTA on June 30, 2015 for nine months or till Mine Developer­-cum-­Operator was appointed by PSPCL through competitive bidding.When the lowest bidder DBL­VPR Consortium was selected through a global tender issued by PSPCL, EMTA coal ltd challenged it before the high court which on January 25, 2019  held that the ETMA will have the first right of refusal in the matter of lending of coal mining lease. It was this HC order that was under challenge before the SC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-upholds-pspcl-decision-on-captive-coal-block-314263

21-09-2021||Chandigarh||Findings on Sun's atmosphere to aid India's first solar mission||A study by Indian scientists has shown how conditions and events in the solar atmosphere like coronal mass ejections influence the accuracy of space weather prediction, which is crucial for the health of our satellites. This understanding will aid the interpretation of data from the upcoming Aditya-L1, India's first solar mission.Space weather refers to the conditions in the solar wind and near-Earth space, which can adversely affect the performance of space-borne and ground-based technological systems. The space weather near the Earth is mainly due to Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), which are frequent explosive expulsions of huge magnetized plasma from the Sun into its surroundings that can blow past the Earth. Example of space weather events is the geomagnetic storm, a perturbation in the Earth’s magnetic field, which can last for few hours to few days. Understanding of how events in the solar atmosphere influence space weather is necessary for monitoring and maintaining our satellites.In the present work, astronomers led by Dr Wageesh Mishra of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, showed that plasma properties and Earth arrival times of CMEs from the Sun can vary substantially.The research, published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomy, is co-authored by Kunjal Dave from C.U. Shah University, Prof Nandita Srivastava from Physical Research Laboratory, and Prof Luca Teriaca from the Max Planck Institute of for the Solar System Research, Germany.The team studied the Earth-directed CMEs and interplanetary counterparts of CMEs with access to publicly available plasma measurements in situ at three locations in the Solar System. They reconstructed a 3D view of the CMEs and ICMEs. Using multi-point remote and in situ observations, the study investigated the differences in the dynamics, arrival time, plasma, and magnetic field parameters of ICME structures at the locations in the heliosphere where the different satellites are located.According to the team, the Sun emits a continuous stream of charged particles called the Solar Wind. “We found that plasma characteristics and arrival times of a CME-driven shock, propagating in a pre-conditioned inhomogeneous medium, may be different at different longitudinal locations in the heliosphere,” said Dr Mishra in a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology on Tuesday.The study highlights the difficulties in connecting the local observations of an ICME from a single in situ spacecraft to its global structures and explains that accurate prediction of large CME structures at any location in the heliosphere is challenging.It emphasised that lack of information about the pre-conditioned ambient solar wind medium can severely limit the accuracy of CME arrival time and space weather prediction. This new understanding will aid the interpretation of data from space missions, the ministry's statement added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/findings-on-suns-atmosphere-to-aid-indias-first-solar-mission-314244

21-09-2021||New Delhi||Centre allows IAS, IPS officers to retain gifts received from foreign dignitaries||The Centre has amended over a 50-year-old rule to allow IAS, IPS and IFoS officers to retain gifts received from foreign dignitaries while being members of the Indian delegation, according to an official order.Existing rules allowed these officers to accept gifts from their near relatives or from personal friends having no official dealings with them, on occasions such as weddings, anniversaries, funerals and religious functions when the making of gifts is in conformity with the prevailing religious and social practice.But they shall make a report to the government if the value of such gift exceeds Rs 25,000, the rules say.Gifts include free transport, free boarding, free lodging or any other service or pecuniary advantage when provided by a person other than a near relative or personal friend having no official dealings with the officer but does not include a casual meal, casual lift or other social hospitality.“No member of the service shall accept any gift without the sanction of the government if the value of a gift exceeds Rs 5,000,” says the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968, applicable to the officers of Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service (IFoS).Member of the service shall avoid accepting lavish hospitality or frequent hospitality from persons having official dealings with them or from industrial or commercial firms or other organisations, these rules say.The Personnel Ministry has now amended these rules and inserted a new sub-rule under Section 11 of the All India Services (Conduct) Rules, 1968.“…a member of the service, being a member of the Indian delegation or otherwise, may receive and retain gifts from foreign dignitaries in accordance with the provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Acceptance or Retention of Gifts or Presentations) Rules, 2012, as amended from time-to-time,” read the recently amended rule.The Personnel Ministry had in March last year sought comments from state governments on the proposed rules.“…presently there are no provisions under the AIS (Conduct) Rules, 1968, with regard to receipt/retention of gifts from foreign dignitaries by members of the AIS being a member of Indian delegation or otherwise. Therefore, it has been decided with the approval of a competent authority to insert a new sub-rule…,” it had said in a communiqué dated March 3 last year.They were asked to send responses by March 31, 2020, positively failing which would be “presumed that the state government has no objection to the proposed amendments”.Gifts received from foreign dignitaries, from known or unknown sources, are usually deposited with the ‘toshakhana’—a repository of such articles—in the Ministry of External Affairs. —  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-allows-ias-ips-officers-to-retain-gifts-received-from-foreign-dignitaries-314226
21-09-2021||Lucknow||Law on population control will be brought ‘at right time’: UP CM||The state government will bring a law for population control “at the right time”, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Tuesday.The government had in July unveiled a policy aimed at stabilising the population in Uttar Pradesh and reducing maternal and infant deaths in a time-bound manner, with Adityanath terming rising population a “hurdle in development”.“Everything is done at an appropriate time. The media earlier used to question the BJP on when it would announce a date for the Ram temple’s construction, but the prime minister (Narendra Modi), despite the Covid-19 pandemic, laid the foundation stone of the temple in Ayodhya on August 5 last year, and all need to be happy now,” Adityanath said at a conclave.“Similarly, Article 370 was also scrapped by the prime minister and Union Home Minister Amit Shah,” he said.On August 5, 2019, the Centre had abrogated Article 370, which gave special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, and bifurcated it into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.At the ‘News 24’ conclave, when asked about his recent ‘abba jaan’ remark, the chief minister said, “They (opposition) want the vote of Muslims but are getting irritated with ‘abba jaan’.”              In Kushinagar, Adityanath, in an apparent attack against the Samajwadi Party had said people who say “abba jaan” used to digest all the ration earlier.On the population law for Uttar Pradesh, the chief minister said, “Everything has a right time and has to be done at the right place.”                 “When the population law is brought, it will be done with fanfare, in the knowledge of the media as we do not believe in doing anything silently,” Adityanath said.In July, a draft Bill on population control was put up on the website of the Uttar Pradesh Law Commission, inviting suggestions from the public till the 19th of the month.It states that people having more than two children in Uttar Pradesh will be debarred from contesting local bodies polls, applying for government jobs or receiving any kind of subsidy.The draft Bill also seeks to prohibit promotions in government jobs for such people, while offering incentives to those limiting their children to two.The law commission is said to have handed over the draft Bill to the government.On Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav’s tweet claiming that a record number of riots have taken place in the state, Adityanath said, “The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) states that there have been zero communal riots in Uttar Pradesh.”  They (opposition) are not depending on their intelligence, but depending on Twitter, he said.Asked about Yadav’s assertions that he is inaugurating works done during the SP government, the chief minister said, “The situation that had emerged in 2017 of the pair (Congress and SP alliance for the elections) coming together, it is their nature to humiliate the state.”             “The BJP is forming the next government with over 350 seats in the coming assembly elections,” he said.To a question on whether he would be chief minister again, Adityanath said, “If you say so I accept it. Thanks for your good wishes.”          Polls for 403-member Uttar Pradesh assembly are due next year. The BJP had won 312 seats last time. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/law-on-population-control-will-be-brought-at-right-time-up-cm-314222

21-09-2021|| Hyderabad||Video of Telangana man thrashing three-year-old daughter goes viral||A brutal incident of a three-year-old girl being thrashed by her father has gone viral, pressing the Department of Women Development and Child Welfare, Telangana, into action. The video circulated on social media shows the girl’s mother smiling while the father hits the girl repeatedly. The father was allegedly beating up the child to make his second wife—who’s not the biological mother of the child—happy.The department officials have since rescued the girl child from Medak town. After the state officials’ intervention, the local police have booked the father, who has meanwhile absconded. In a tweet, the Department of Women Development and Child Welfare said, “The team had rescued the child on Monday and shifted to a safe space. The child will be produced before the Child Welfare Committee for further orders. We’ll ensure the child’s safety and appropriate action is taken against the father”. The video was reportedly taken by a neighbour who previously tried to prevent the father from beating the child but was asked to mind his own business. The police, after talking to locals, have identified the father as Madisetty Nagaraju (32) and his wife as Sunayana, who watched her daughter being beaten. The reason for the beastly act is still unknown, but sources said that the man repeatedly resorted to the child's beating to please his second wife.  It is being told that Nagaraju, who was working as a tractor driver in Medak Municipality, left his first wife and got married again. But he took custody of his daughter from his first wife. This has irked the stepmother, who then encouraged Nagaraju to hit her and even asked him to get rid of the child. The Department of Women Development and Child Welfare, Telangana, is considering handing the child’s custody to her biological mother and is currently exploring its options.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/video-of-telangana-man-thrashing-three-year-old-daughter-goes-viral-314211

As Dalits here are not allowed inside the temple, they always prayed from outside standing in front of the temple.The father wanted to pray to the god from outside along with his son. However, the toddler in excitement ran inside the temple and prayed to the god and came back. The incident took place on September 4.This became a big issue as upper caste villagers thought that the temple was desecrated as a Dalit boy had entered it. They held a meeting on September 11 and asked the parents to pay Rs 23,000 as fine which is going to be used to carry out purification rituals in the temple.However, the district administration which came to know about the development has sent police, revenue and social welfare department officials to the village. The officers have conducted an awareness programme with regard to untouchability for all villagers.The officers took members of the upper caste to task for imposing a fine on the Dalit boy's parents and let them off after warning that legal action will be initiated if they repeat this.T. Sridhar, Superintendent of Police, Koppal, told IANS that he visited the spot. The culprits were admonished. They apologized to the father of the boy. Though the police went to the house of the victim to convince him to lodge a complaint, the community elders decided not to do so as it will breed animosity."The people from upper caste themselves opposed the action of the members of their own community and apologized to the Dalit boy's family," he explained.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-dalit-family-fined-rs-23-000-after-their-toddler-son-enters-temple-314208

Last month, Vice President Kamala Harris' visit to Vietnam was slightly delayed after several staffers reported similar symptoms.Havana syndrome was first alleged in 2016 by US and Canadian embassy staff in Cuba. Said to cause pain in the head, reports have suggested some kind of neurological attack by unnamed adversaries that seems to largely affect US diplomats. Similar incidents have been reported from the US itself as well as Austria, Germany and China.In the latest case, a member of Burns’ delegation reported a similar thing and had to be given medical attention during his visit to India this month. From there, the team travelled to Pakistan.The visit by Burns to meet NSA Ajit Doval after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban was closely guarded and neither side put out any statement on the interaction.There was no official US comment to the reports in the US media. “We don't comment on specific incidents or officers. We have protocols in place for when individuals report possible anomalous health incidents that include receiving appropriate medical treatment. We will keep doing everything we can to protect our officers,” a CIA spokesperson said.Studies of the diplomats in Cuba who were first hit by the problem had found evidence of some form of brain injury but did not determine the cause, according to a study published in the journal JAMA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cia-chiefs-team-member-on-india-trip-claims-to-be-hit-by-mystery-illness-314192

21-09-2021||New York||We must not forget 9/11 terrorist attacks: India||The 9/11 terror attacks, their victims and lessons learnt from the "heinous" assault must not be forgotten, India has said, asserting that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is condemnable.Secretary (West) in the Ministry of External Affairs Reenat Sandhu on Monday paid tributes to victims of the September 11 terror attacks at a memorial ceremony organised by the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism on behalf of the United Nations and the 9/11 Memorial & Museum.“We must not forget the heinous terrorist attacks, the victims and the lessons learnt. Terrorism in all its forms and manifestations is condemnable,” India's Permanent Mission to the UN said in a tweet.Sandhu paid a floral tribute at the 9/11 memorial pools that sit in the footprints of the former North and South Towers that had collapsed after American Airlines and United Airlines planes hijacked by al Qaeda terrorists crashed into them.The names of the 2,983 people who were killed in the 2001 and 1993 terrorist attacks are inscribed on the bronze parapets edging the memorial pools. Victims of the 9/11 attacks were people from over 90 countries, including India.Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the 9/11 memorial site in September 2014 and paid a solemn homage to victims of the 2001 terror attack, placing five rose buds one by one on the memorial slabs where names of the victims are etched.On the eve of the commencement of the annual high-level week of the 76th session of the UN General Assembly, the United Nations held a special tribute ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

21-09-2021||Washington||Ex-official in Trump admn for greater counter-terrorism coordination with India on Afghanistan||Ahead of a maiden bilateral meet between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden, a former national security official in the Trump Administration has pushed for greater counter-terrorism coordination with India on Afghanistan and reevaluation of its reliance on Pakistan in the matter.Lisa Curtis, the director of the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Centre for a New American Security think-tank, said though it is too late to penalise Pakistan, the US should learn from 20 years of intransigence and maintain low expectations from Islamabad when it comes to counter-terrorism cooperation.Since 2001, no US administration has been able to successfully convince Pakistan to crack down on Taliban activity inside its territory, she wrote in the periodical Foreign Affairs.Former president Donald Trump, for his part, suspended US military assistance in January 2018, but Islamabad still failed to disrupt the group's operational activity, financial transactions, or cross-border flows of weapons and fighters, Curtis said."It may be possible for Washington to work with Islamabad when targeting other terrorist groups such as ISIS-K, the Islamic State's Afghanistan offshoot. But Pakistan's intelligence service will never turn on the al Qaeda-linked Haqqani network."Pakistani military and intelligence leaders rely on the latter to deny India a foothold in Afghanistan," she wrote in the periodical.Instead, the Biden administration should refocus its efforts on coordination with other regional democracies, especially India. For too long, Washington eschewed the idea of counter-terrorism cooperation with New Delhi out of deference to Pakistan, Curtis said."With that policy in tatters, the United States must realise that it has far more to gain by coordinating with democratic states that fight terrorism than by fruitlessly trying to work with regimes that rely on terrorist proxies to achieve regional objectives," she argued.

There are governance issues,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud told advocate RP Mehrotra, who represented the 17-year-old petitioner.NEET: Notice to Centre, NBE, NMCThe Supreme Court on Monday issued a notice to the Centre, National Board of Examination (NBE) and National Medical Commission (NMC) on a petition, challenging alleged last-minute changes in the syllabus for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) PG Super Specialty Exam 2021 scheduled in November. The matter has been posted for further hearing on September 27.Noting that the complexities of governance didn’t permit it to issue such directions, the top court said, “We should leave something for the democratic way of life that the country has adopted. Surely the government wants the children to go back to schools…This issue is fraught with great complexities. We can’t give a judicial mandate in a petition where we don’t have any data”.The Bench pointed out that the country had just come out of the second wave of Covid-19 and there was still danger of a possible spike of infection.“Ask your client to focus on studies in school and not get involved himself in seeking constitutional remedies. You see how misplaced this petition is. I am not saying it is a publicity gimmick but this is why children must not get involved in these issues.

Let there be no misgivings about our Punjab Chief Minister,” Surjewala said after Rawat’s remark gave ammunition to the rival parties.BSP chief Mayawati said, “The appointment a few months before elections looks like a poll gimmick.” SAD leaders asked if Channi was just a “night watchman”, while BJP’s Amit Malviya termed Rawat’s remark a huge insult to Dalits.“If Channi has been made the CM only to hold the seat for Sidhu, it completely undermines the Dalit empowerment narrative peddled by the Congress,” said Malviya.Hitting back, Surjewala asked the BJP why it had not named a single Dalit leader as CM in the states ruled by it. “The Congress has taken a historic decision in Punjab.

This smacks of racism.”Tagging a thread on Twitter that explained the rules, Tharoor also slammed the restrictions on vaccinated Indians, saying, “Because of this I have pulled out of a debate at the @cambridgeunion & out of launch events for the UK edition of my book #TheBattleOfBelonging (published there as #TheStruggleForIndiasSoul).”“It is offensive to ask fully vaccinated Indians to quarantine. The Brits are reviewing!” the former minister of state for external affairs said.From October 4, the current traffic light system of red, amber and green countries based on levels of Covid-19 risk will be scrapped in the UK and replaced with one red list only.The scrapping of an amber list, which is what India is currently on, means reduced cost burden for travellers—especially for the Indian diaspora vaccinated in the UK—related to compulsory PCR tests.However, an expanded list of countries whose vaccines are recognised in England does not include India, which means that Indians vaccinated with Covishield—the Serum Institute of India produced Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine—would still be subjected to the restrictions mandatory for those unvaccinated.This new two-tiered system in the UK is expected to stay in place till the end of the year, with a further review planned for early in the New Year.

Hundreds of disciples of Giri have reached the Mutt, but they have been prevented from going inside. The disciples refused to believe that the saint had ended his life and insisted that there was some foul play.Giri was involved in a bitter property dispute with his junior Anand Giri a few months ago. The matter was later resolved.Sources said that a five-page suicide note has also been recovered in which Giri has held one of his disciples responsible for his death. The police, however, refused to confirm this.Giri had replaced Mahant Gyan Das as the chief of the Akhara Parishad in March 2016. While the electoral process replacing Gyan Das was conducted a year ago in 2015, the controversial Mahant had refused to cede ground to Giri.Das was allegedly facing charges of criminal activities and objectionable behaviour and had about half-a-dozen criminal cases pertaining to attempt to murder, loot, dacoity and economic offences registered against him in Ayodhya and Allahabad, mostly by the sadhus of the Akhara Parishad.As the president of the Akhara Parishad, Giri played a key role in the Kumbh Mela held in Ujjain, Prayagraj and recently in Haridwar. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/akhara-parishad-chief-found-dead-under-mysterious-circumstances-313806

21-09-2021||New Delhi||Focus on studies, don’t get involved in seeking remedies, SC tells minor||The Supreme Court Monday advised a 17-year-old Class 12 student, who sought re-opening of schools across the country, to focus on studies instead of getting involved in seeking Constitutional remedies. The top court said it would not call the plea a publicity gimmick but it was a misplaced petition and children must not get involved in such issues.A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and B V Nagarathna refused to entertain the petition, saying the student from Delhi may pursue his remedies with the state government.The bench told advocate Ravi Prakash Mehrotra, “Ask your client to focus on studies in school and not get involved himself in seeking Constitutional remedies. You see how misplaced this petition is. Imagine the situation in Kerala, Maharashtra cannot be the same in Maharashtra and Delhi. I am not saying it is a publicity gimmick but this is why children must not get involved in these issues. We don’t have any kind of data before us.” The top court then perused the prayers in the petition and said that the petitioner wants re-opening of schools to enable physical classes. “After Article 21A has been brought into force, it has obligated the State governments to provide free and compulsory education to all children between the age 6 to 14. You see the governments are ultimately answerable. They are also concerned about the need for children to go back to schools. That is the purpose of schools. We cannot, by judicial diktat, say that you shall send your children back to school, oblivious of the dangers which may be there,” the bench said. The country has just come out of the second wave but there is still danger of a possible spike of viral infection, it said. “I am not saying it will necessarily happen or that it will be similarly devastating. Fortunately, we now have reports which suggest that the spike will not be of that nature. Vaccination is taking place but children are not vaccinated, even many teachers may not have been vaccinated. We cannot just say send all children to schools. There are governance issues,” the bench said. It further added that the complexities of governance do not permit the court to start issuing directions and “we should leave something for the democratic way of life that the country has adopted. Surely the government wants their children to go back to the schools”.The bench said that in Karnataka a decision has been taken to open the schools and similarly in Delhi also a decision has been taken, but “we cannot allow young kids to go and mix with senior students and instead let the States take an informed decision where the spike is taking place. There may be some state with 75 districts or 52 districts and there may be states with high density of population in some districts and others may be sparsely populated. These are the matters in which we should let the government take a call”. Justice Chandrachud said there has to be some balancing of interest of children, who are at home and how they are being affected physically, mentally or physiologically with the dangers which may be posed to them, if they are to mix with each other in a school environment.“The government has taken a decision to vaccinate the children. Our government has taken a decision to have a phased reopening of school at the board level. We cannot pick up children in the first standard and mix them with the children of board level, who are to make foray into higher education,” he said. The bench suggested that the petitioner must withdraw the petition and pursue other remedies like representation to the government and said, “This issue is fraught with great complexities. We cannot give any judicial mandate in a petition where we don’t have any data”. It told Mehrotra, “The government itself has to tread with extreme care when the issue is of exposing the younger children to the dangers of Covid-19. So the court needs to be equally or even more careful because there is absence of data before us, absence of scientific knowledge on our part and the petitioner. This petition is not based on any scientific assessment”. Justice Chandrachud said that judges also read newspapers and know what has happened when schools were opened in many countries at an early stage of pandemic. “We need not mention the names of those countries but we know what happened in such countries where schools were opened at earlier stages,” the bench said. Mehrotra, who is father of the minor, agreed to withdraw the petition, which the court allowed him to do.In his plea filed in the month of August, the minor petitioner said that he has filed the PIL on account of the indecision and vacillation on the part of the Union Government and several state governments/UTs in the country in re-opening of schools and resumption of physical classes. “The petitioner is also echoing the sentiments and feelings of a large body of the student community and fraternity of the country, particularly including the underprivileged and voiceless children, in raising this very vital issue regarding the deprivation and ill-effects, both psychological and actual, of school children being kept away from attending their schools physically..,” the plea said.

21-09-2021||Mumbai||Kangana Ranaut files counter defamation case against Javed Akhtar, says 'lost faith in this court'||Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut appeared before a Mumbai court on Monday in connection with a criminal defamation complaint filed against her by lyricist Javed Akhtar, and said she had "lost faith" in the magistrate's court as it indirectly "threatened" her of issuing a warrant if she failed to appear before it in a bailable offence.Ranaut also moved a counter complaint in the court against Akhtar for alleged "extortion and criminal intimidation", and her lawyer informed the court that they had filed an application before chief metropolitan magistrate, seeking transfer of hearing into the complaint to another court.The court had last week said it will issue a warrant against Ranaut if she fails to appear on the next date of hearing on September 20.Ranaut appeared before Andheri metropolitan magistrate R R Khan on Monday for the first time since summons was issued to her in February this year, and completed the bail formalities.As the matter came up for hearing, her lawyer Rizwan Siddique told that court that Ranaut does not want to proceed with this court (in connection with the complaint).Siddique said they have "lost faith in the court as it seems to be biased".The court has indirectly "threatened" her of issuing a warrant on two occasions in a non-cognisable, compoundable and bailable offence, where as per law regular presence is not required, the lawyer claimed.Ranaut has been called before the court without any cause or reason, he said.He further submitted that till today, there is no order as to why she is required to be present regularly for the bailable, non-cognisable and compoundable offence.Akhtar's lawyer Jay Bharadwaj termed Ranaut's plea for transfer of complaint to another court as "extremely bizzare"."They have neither given any notice nor a copy of the (transfer) application to us," he said.The court will hear the matter next on November 15.  Earlier this month, the Bombay High Court dismissed a plea filed by Ranaut seeking quashing of proceedings initiated against her by the local court on the criminal defamation complaint filed by Akhtar. Justice Revati Mohite-Dere had said in the order that there was no procedural illegality or irregularity in the metropolitan magistrate's order initiating the proceedings. Akhtar (76) had filed the complaint in the court in November last year, claiming Ranaut had made defamatory statements against him in a television interview, which allegedly damaged his reputation. In his complaint, Akhtar claimed that Ranaut dragged his name during an interview while referring to a 'coterie' existing in Bollywood, following the alleged suicide committed by actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June last year.
