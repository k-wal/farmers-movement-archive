30-09-2021||Kanpur/Gorakhpur (UP)||Kanpur trader’s death: Adityanath meets kin, promises job to wife, fair probe||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday met the family of the Kanpur businessman who died during a police raid at a Gorakhpur hotel, assuring a fair probe and a government job to his wife.The CM has also directed the Kanpur district administration to prepare a proposal to increase the ex gratia to the family from Rs 10 lakh announced earlier, sources at the Chief Minister’s Office said.Victim Manish Gupta’s wife, Meenakshi Gupta, told reporters that the CM has accepted their all demands and agreed to transfer the case from Gorakhpur to Kanpur.Meanwhile, according to the post-mortem report, Gupta had injury marks on the whole body besides a skull injury.Earlier in the day, the CM had said the guilty won’t be spared in the case, in which six policemen have been booked on the murder charge.The sources said CM Adityanath announced that Gupta’s wife will be given the job of an officer on special duty (OSD) in the Kanpur Development Authority.Meenakshi Gupta told reporters, “The CM has accepted all our demands and we are satisfied with the meeting.”“The CM has asked for an application for a CBI inquiry as per our demand and has accepted my plea for a government job and financial security for my son’s future,” she said.“Besides, he has also agreed to transfer the case from Gorakhpur to Kanpur, taking note of the seriousness of the matter,” she said.Meanwhile, the Opposition slammed the state government over law and order.Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav, who rushed to the home of the businessman at Burra in Kanpur, demanded a CBI probe under the supervision of a sitting High Court judge.He also announced Rs 20 lakh to the family besides assuring of meeting legal costs in the fight for justice.Yadav said the incident is part of the state government’s “thoko neeti” (encounter policy), which has given a licence to kill to “trigger-happy policemen”.Akhilesh alleged that evidence has been destroyed from the hotel where Gupta was “murdered”.If justice is not done, then SP will launch a march from Kanpur to Lucknow to wake up the government from its slumber, he said.BSP supremo Mayawati too sought a CBI inquiry into the matter.Mayawati termed as “grossly unfair” the “attempt” by the Gorakhpur police to “save” the policemen, who were prima facie guilty of vandalism in the hotel.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hit out at the BJP government and according to party sources, she is likely to pay a visit to the victim’s family.Meanwhile, two senior Gorakhpur officials were allegedly caught on tape, apparently asking a Kanpur businessman’s family not to pursue his death case.It is not immediately clear whether the video was recorded before or after a murder case was registered.In the video put up by the Uttar Pradesh Congress on its Twitter handle, an officer in a police uniform and another sitting next to him are seen with the kin of the dead businessman.The officer in police uniform has an IPS badge on his shoulder.Samajwadi Party’s district president Ram Nagina Sahni said they appeared to be District Magistrate Vijay Kiran Anand and SSP Vipin Tada.The Kanpur police and the district administration on Thursday morning persuaded Gupta’s family to perform the last rites.The autopsy report said there were injury marks on the entire body of the victim, including eyes, limbs and back besides a wide skull injury.Gorakhpur ADG Akhil Kumar inspected the hotel and told the reporters that the probe has been handed over to the crime branch.The ADG said medical reports and CCTV footage will be incorporated in the probe.Since the accusation is against police, care will be taken to conduct the probe in an impartial manner, he said.Gorakhpur SSP Vipin Tada said three policemen—Ramgarhtal SHO Jagat Narayan Singh, Sub-Inspectors Akshay Mishra and Vijay Yadav—have been named in the case.Inspector K K Rana, who was recently transferred from Gonda, has taken the charge of the Ramgarhtal police station.

30-09-2021||New Delhi||India using ‘forward policy’ at LAC: Beijing||After decades, China has once again accused India of pursuing the “forward policy” in its border dispute with India.China had justified its hostilities on the border with India in 1962 with a similar accusation.India’s forward policy is the “root cause of tension” in the China-India border situation, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying on being asked to respond to reports about the Indian Army moving some of its latest US-acquired military hardware to the Line of Actual Control. Interestingly, the question was asked by the Beijing correspondent of Tass, a Russian news agency.According to Indian military historians, China in fact carried out forward policy before the 1962 war by venturing into Indian territory to ambush Indian patrols.The spokesperson said China opposed any arms race in the disputed border areas for the purpose of competition over control. “We have always been firm in safeguarding national territorial sovereignty and security, and committed to peace and stability in the China-India border areas,” she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-using-forward-policy-at-lac-beijing-318343
30-09-2021||New Delhi||CWC meeting will be convened very soon: Surjewala a day after Azad, Sibal demanded it||The Congress Working Committee (CWC) will meet “very soon”, the party said on Thursday, a day after some senior leaders demanded such a meeting in the face of multiple desertions and turmoil in the organisation.Chief spokesperson of the Congress Randeep Surjewala said the party president had indicated last week that a meeting of the CWC, the top decision-making body of the party, would be called very soon.“Before leaving for Shimla, Congress president Sonia Gandhi had already indicated that a CWC meeting shall be called very soon. Accordingly, the CWC meeting shall be held in the coming days,” Surjewala told PTI.On Wednesday, senior party leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Kapil Sibal, who are part of a group of 23 leaders (G-23) seeking organisational revamp, demanded that a meeting of the CWC be convened immediately to discuss internal party issues such as a spate of defections from the party and turmoil in many state units including Punjab.Sibal had also raised questions on the decision-making process in the party in the absence of a regular president, and demanded dialogue where all senior leaders would be heard.“In our party at the moment there is no president. So we don’t know who is taking these decisions. We know and yet we don’t know.... I believe one of my senior colleagues has written to the Congress president to immediately convene a CWC. So that at least some things that we can’t speak publicly, we can have a dialogue in the CWC as to why we are in this state,” he said.Azad has written to the Congress president demanding that a meeting of the CWC be immediately convened.Azad said the party should welcome suggestions and not suppress them.While Azad and some other G-23 leaders are part of the CWC, Sibal is not.Hitting back at Sibal, Surjewala had said, “Every Congressman and woman must also seriously introspect whether by their words and actions they are attempting to weaken the Congress in the times of crisis.”Sibal had said, “We are not ‘Jee Huzur 23’. We will continue to put forth our views and will continue to repeat our demands.”In an apparent attack on the party leadership, he said there is no monopoly in the power structure of any country or political party.

30-09-2021||New Delhi||Monsoon season officially ends with ‘normal’ rains with just one per cent deficiency||The June-September Southwest Monsoon season officially ended on Thursday with “normal” rains, the India Meteorological Department said.“Quantitatively, the 2021 all India monsoon seasonal rainfall during June 1 to September 30 has been 87 cm against the Long Period Average of 88 cm of 1961-2010 (99 per cent of its LPA),” IMD Director General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said.“The Southwest Monsoon seasonal rainfall for the country as a whole during June-September has been normal (96-106 per cent of the LPA),” he added.Meanwhile, conditions are favourable for commencement of its withdrawal from some parts of Northwest around October 6 “With westward movement of the Depression over northeast Arabian Sea, away from Indian Coast, numerical weather prediction models consensus indicate establishment of westerly and northwesterly winds at lower and middle tropospheric levels over Northwest and development of lower-level anti-cyclonic circulation over the region from October 5,” resulting in decrease in humidity over the region.Notably, last year, the withdrawal date was revised to September 17 by the IMD.The prolonged active spell has certainly helped reduce the rain deficit.The Northwest, which was supposed to receive “below normal” rains in September, as per the IMD, is just 4 per cent short and stands in the “normal category” of rains. The Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi meteorological subdivision received 30 per cent more rains than the LPA and is in the ‘excess’ category of rains.Punjab, with seven per cent deficiency, is also in the ‘normal’ category according to the IMD. Western UP (minus 21) and J&K and Ladakh (minus 29) are the two subdivisions in the ‘deficit category’ in the Northwest.After deficient rains in August, Mohapatra had predicted “above normal” in September barring “large parts of the Northwest and Northeast”, which he said, will get “below normal rains” in the last leg.As the situation stands today, Central India is four per cent in excess and South Peninsula 11 per cent. Apart from Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, the other areas with a deficit are East UP and Northeast India.  This is for the third consecutive year that the country has recorded rainfall in the normal and above category.Monsoon 2021: Main features*Monsoon normal (96 -104% of LPA).*Quantitatively rainfall during June 1 to September 30: 87.0 cm against long period average of 88.0 cm*Northwest (96%) Central (104%) East and Northeast India (88%) South Peninsula India (111%)*Core zone, which consists of most of the rainfed agriculture regions in the country, is above normal (>106% of LPA).*Of the total 36 meteorological subdivisions, 20 subdivisions constituting 58% of the total area of the country received normal seasonal rainfall, 10 subdivisions received excess rainfall (25% of the total area) and 6 subdivisions (17% of the total area) received deficient season rainfall||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monsoon-season-officially-ends-with-normal-rains-with-just-one-per-cent-deficiency-318337

30-09-2021||New Delhi||As private liquor vends in Delhi shut down, their owners, employees explore other businesses||On his last day at work, Nilesh Kumar, a salesman at a private liquor vend at Govind Puri here, says he is clueless about his future.His shop along with 259 other such private vends will wind up their business from Thursday evening as recommended by the Delhi government’s new excise policy under which all the 850 liquor vends, including these 260-odd outlets, have been given to private firms through open tender.The new licence holders will start retail sale of liquor in the city from November 17. In the transition period of nearly one-and-half months, only government-run liquor vends will remain open. The government vends will close down on November 16.As private liquor shops prepare to shut down permanently, owners and employees of such establishments said they have started exploring alternate options, including venturing into other home businesses like property dealing and looking for jobs in other sectors.Some are even thinking of retirement.Nilesh is not alone. Nearly 3,000 such employees are likely to get affected by the closure of private liquor vends in the national capital.Nilesh says he has no other job or business and is thinking of moving to his hometown in Uttar Pradesh’s Moradabad.“I am clueless about my future. I have no other option left than to go to my hometown and start something on my own. I used to earn good at the liquor shop and I have no other skill to try my hands at. But now due to government’s new liquor policy, all private liquor shops are being shut so I will have to go back,” Kumar lamented.Naresh Goyal, president Delhi Liquor Traders Association, said the closure of private liquor vends will have adverse impact on people engaged in this business and owners and managers of such establishments have started looking for alternative arrangements.“Some owners have other businesses as well so they will most likely shift their focus to them, while some are thinking of venturing into property dealing business.“I also know many of people engaged in this business who are searching jobs and even are ready to work as managers at new swanky vends which would function after November 16,” Goyal said.According to the new excise policy, swanky liquor vends will be set up in 32 zones across the city where people would be able to walk-in and choose the liquor brand of their choice. Some of such establishments will also have arrangement for snacks and other eating items.Goyal further said some arrangement should have been made in the policy to adjust the old vendors as it might create a “chaotic” situation.He said the closure of private liquor vends would create more problems for 3,000-odd employees at these shops.Another businessman of the industry, Virendra Kumar Jatav, said the future of nearly 3,000 employees is at stake as they have nowhere to go.“These employees and even shop owners are looking for other livelihoods such as partnerships in other businesses. Big businessman can get into some other trade but employees of such liquor shops are at the receiving end. Many are going back to their villages or hometowns,” Jatav said.Jatav, who is also engaged with SC, ST, OBC Workers Parishangh, said the government should make some arrangement at least for the employees of such liquor vends to secure their future.The Delhi government under its new excise policy has divided the city into 32 zones and bid the liquor vends there aiming an equitable distribution of retail liquor business across the city. Each zone comprising 8-10 wards will have around 27 vends.There are 26 municipal wards in the city where no liquor shops will open after September 30 as they were catered to by private vends only. There are already 80 wards where there is no liquor vends. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-private-liquor-vends-in-delhi-shut-down-their-owners-employees-explore-other-businesses-318322

He was the commanding officer of a frontline fighter squadron and has also commanded a frontline fighter base.Apart from various operational issues, Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari will have to also address matters related to the ambitious theaterisation model of the armed forces.The theatre commands are being planned to integrate the capabilities of the three services and to ensure optimal utilisation of their resources.The theatre commands are being set up under a larger mandate of ensuring synergy among the three service chiefs to deal with future security challenges.Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat has been focusing on bringing convergence among the three services and restructuring military commands to effectively deal with future security challenges.There has been a growing perception that the Indian Air Force has some reservations about the theaterisation programme.

30-09-2021||Coimbatore||Forced to withdraw complaint, subjected to banned test, alleges sexually assaulted IAF officer||A 28-year-old female Air Force officer at the Air Force Administrative College here who was sexually assaulted, has levelled serious charges against the IAF authorities, including subjecting her to a banned finger test and also forcing her to withdraw the complaint against the accused Flight Lieutenant.The charges found place in the FIR registered by the police based on the complaint by the woman officer at the All Woman Police Station, after the IAF authorities including College Commandant failed to take action till September 20 on the incident which happened on September 10.The woman also alleged she was subjected to ‘two-finger test’ at the Air Force Hospital to ascertain rape, which was banned by the Supreme Court a few years ago.Police had arrested the accused Amitesh Harmukh on September 25 and he is in judicial custody.Both the rape victim and the accused, hailing from Chhattisgarh, were part of a training course and had attended a party in the officers’ mess on the night of September 9.The woman officer in her complaint said the incident occurred in the wee hours of the next day when she was sleeping after taking medicine for her leg injury and was assaulted by the drunk officer, who had narrated the incident to two of her batch mates who recorded the conversation between the trio.She approached a wing commander on the incident and came to the room along with a woman wing commander, who ‘advised’ her to think about the future including the name and respect of the family, based on which she communicated to one of her friends that she was not going to lodge any complaint.However, as both the wing commanders again approached her and told her to either file the complaint or give in writing that the episode was consensual, she subsequently mustered courage and decided to file the complaint, amid the finger test in the evening in the hospital.The victim further said she had handed over the mattress which had strains of semen to two women doctors, the FIR said.After cajoling by two senior officers, who informed that the test was negative, the commandant asked her to withdraw the case in writing saying if pursued, it will be flashed in the media and bring disrepute to the Air Force and herself, police said.However, she went to the city police commissioner’s office on September 20 and from there the all-woman police station registered the case.When contacted, a senior IAF officer, on condition of anonymity, refused to comment on the issue as the matter was in court and sensitive.Meanwhile, the IAF had filed a petition in the court that local police has no right to arrest the officer and only the defence court is the jurisdiction where a court martial can be conducted and therefore hand over the accused to the IAF. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/forced-to-withdraw-complaint-subjected-to-banned-test-alleges-sexually-assaulted-iaf-officer-318303

30-09-2021||New Delhi||Border incidents with China will continue till boundary agreement is reached: Army Chief||Border incidents between India and China will continue to occur till a boundary agreement is reached between the two countries, Army Chief General M M Naravane said on Thursday.Recent developments in Afghanistan “have definitely been the focus” of the Indian Army that continues to evaluate threat perceptions and formulate strategies accordingly, the Army chief added while addressing a gathering at the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Discussing China, he said, “... we have an outstanding border issue. We are again well prepared to meet any misadventure that may occur as we have demonstrated in the past.”                 “Such kinds of incidents will continue to occur till such time that a long-term solution is reached, and that is to have a boundary agreement. And that should be the thrust of our efforts so that we have lasting peace along the northern (China) border,” he stated during the annual session meeting of the industry body. Referring to Afghanistan, he said the Indian Army “or the armed forces for that matter continue to carry out periodic evaluation of threat perceptions”.Based on those evaluations, the Indian Army formulates strategies and doctrines that are needed to meet future threats, he noted.“This is a continuous process that never stops,”” he added.Kabul fell to the Taliban on August 15. Expressing its concerns about the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, India had on September 20 had said the country’s territory should not be used for sheltering, training, planning or financing terrorist acts.As far as the terrorist threat is concerned, the Indian Army is ready to meet all challenges, Naravane said.“We have a very dynamic counterinsurgency and counterterrorist grid in Jammu and Kashmir. It is a dynamic grid and it is based on threat perception and the escalating levels of attempts by our western neighbour (Pakistan) to push in more and more terrorists,” he said.Based on ups and downs, we also recalibrate our levels of operations, he added.The current border standoff between the Indian and Chinese armies erupted in May last year following a violent clash in the Pangong lake area. Both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.The row escalated after the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15 last year. Twenty Indian Army personnel laid down their lives in the clashes that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in decades.In February 2021, China officially acknowledged that five Chinese military officers and soldiers were killed in the clashes with the Indian Army though it is widely believed that the death toll was higher.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in Gogra area last month.In February, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in line with an agreement on disengagement.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC (Line of Actual Control) in the sensitive sector.In 2017, Indian and Chinese troops were engaged in a 73-day stand-off in Doklam tri-junction which even triggered fears of a war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.

Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has demanded that a case be registered against all the high-ranking police officials, who have had links with the now arrested fake antique dealer Mavunkal.BJP General Secretary B. Gopalakrishnan told the media in Trissur that by now visuals of former State Police chief Loknath Behra and Additional Director General of Police Manoj Abraham visiting the antique dealer at his Kochi 'museum' have come out."According to the rules, any antique dealer has to have a license and it is strange that these high-ranking police officials, who know what the rules are did nothing, instead they appeared to give full support to Mavunkal. Hence, a case should be registered against all those police officials who were giving all the support to Mavunkal, who used this as a license to cheat others," said Gopalakrishnan."The Home department appears to have turned into an antique department as complaints against this antique dealer have been lying with the police since 2018 and in this even the office of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is also under a cloud," added Gopalakrishnan.Mavunkal, 54, who claimed to have "some of the original 30 pieces of silver", was arrested from his home at Chertalai in Alappuzha district on Saturday, even as his daughter's marriage was being fixed.On Tuesday, a court in Ernakulam gave two more days' custody of Mavunkal to the Crime Branch police.Since his arrest, everyday new stories of how Mavunkal had been taking people for a ride are emanating and the image of the Kerala Police appears to have gone for a toss.It all surfaced after the victims approached Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan with their complaint of being swindled of Rs 10 crore by Mavunkal. The CM had directed for a Crime Branch probe into the complaints.Mavunkal took all his high profile guests into his fold by showcasing antiques in his collection which he claimed included the "staff of Moses" and "two of the 30 silver coins that were taken by Judas to cheat Jesus Christ".Police said he had showcased these "rare" items -- a throne said to be used by Tipu Sultan as well as a huge collection of old Qurans, Bibles (Old Testament and New Testament), and old handwritten copies of Bhagavad Gita.Mavunkal used to bring several VIPs to his palatial residence, a part of which was converted into a museum to house his 'precious' antiques.With inputs from IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/porsche-registered-in-kareena-kapoors-name-found-in-possession-of-fake-antique-dealer-in-kerala-318269

Bharat Biotech had submitted EOI (Expression of Interest) on April 19 for its vaccine.The latest ‘Status of COVID-19 vaccines within WHO EUL/PQ evaluation process’ guidance document dated September 29 on the WHO website said that the decision date for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is “October 2021”.The WHO said it began rolling data of the vaccine on July 6. Rolling data allows the WHO to start its review right away, as information continues to come in, to accelerate the overall review process.According to the WHO, submissions to WHO for prequalification or listing under the emergency use procedure are confidential.If a product submitted for assessment is found to meet the criteria for listing, the WHO will publish the results widely.Duration of the emergency use listing process depends on the quality of the data submitted by the vaccine manufacturer and on those data meeting WHO criteria, according to the agency.Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s Covishield are the two widely used vaccines in India.Bharat Biotech recently said it submitted all data pertaining to Covaxin to the WHO for EUL and is awaiting feedback from the global health watchdog.“#COVAXIN clinical trial data was fully compiled & available in June 2021.All Data submitted for Emergency Use Listing (EUL) Application to World Health Organization in early July.

There were only financial problems."“Mark my words, this decade will be India's decade of inclusive growth. In FY'23, we expect growth to be between 6.5 and 7 per cent and then accelerating further as the impact of these reforms is seen," he said while addressing a virtual event organised by the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) on Wednesday."On average, I expect growth to be greater than 7 per cent in this decade for India," Subramanian said.During the current fiscal, he said, growth would be in double-digits and it could moderate to 6.5 -7 per cent in the next financial year.The Economic Survey 2020-21, released in January this year, had projected GDP growth of 11 per cent during the current financial year ending March 2022.The Survey had said growth would be supported by supply-side push from reforms and easing of regulations, infrastructural investments, boost to manufacturing sector through the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, recovery of pent-up demand, increase in discretionary consumption subsequent to the rollout of vaccines and pick up in credit.“When you look at the data itself, the V-shaped recovery and the quarterly growth patterns actually establish the fundamentals of the economy are strong. Looking forward, the kind of reforms that we've done and the supply side measures that we've taken will enable actually strong growth not only this year going forward as well,” said the top Indian economist.Growth would be aided by various structural reforms, including labour and farm laws, undertaken by the government, he said.Subramanian said from the long-run perspective, India is the only country that for the last 18 to 20 months had done so many structural reforms.

30-09-2021||Kozhikode||This Kerala Muslim woman artist makes paintings of Lord Krishna, then gifts them to temples||She has made hundreds of paintings of Lord Krishna in the past six years but her faith has not allowed her to keep any of them at her house.She has been gifting the portraits of little Krishna to the famed Guruvayur Sri Krishna Temple in Thrissur without fail in these years but tradition and customs have not allowed her to go inside the shrine or present it in front of the sanctum sanctorum.As non-Hindus are not allowed inside the ancient temple, she would either place her painting near the hundi in front of the portal or hand it over to shrine staff on Vishu and Janmashtami days every year.But, all these have never drained the spirit and longing of this devout Muslim woman, hailing from a conservative family in Koyilandy in this north Kerala district, to draw the paintings of the Hindu deity.Setting aside the stiff objection from her relatives and community members, Jasna Salim, a 28-year old homemaker, has done over 500 paintings of little Lord Krishna, which have a large number of takers in and outside the state.And, now, the untrained painter said her happiness knew no bounds as she could directly present a painting of her at a Hindu temple after they formally requested it.Ulanadu Sree Krishna Swamy temple, located near Pandalam in Pathanamthitta district, on Sunday ritually accepted her painting, depicting little Krishna with a butter pot, after inviting her there."It was really a dream come true for me. It was for the first time in my life that I was going inside a temple and seeing the idol of a deity standing in front of the sanctum sanctorum," Salim told PTI.Though once she had been to a family temple near her home here during a festival, she did not go near the sanctum sanctorum or see the deity."It was really a soulful experience...the temple authorities explained the rituals to me. I opened the painting standing in front of the sanctum sanctorum and showed it to the deity. The priest adorned the painting with a tulsi garland," the woman said.A mother of two, Salim said she had been approached by the temple authorities after seeing a picture dedicated to the Guruvayur temple by her during the last Janmashtami.The management informed the painter recently that a Pune-based devotee group wanted to offer a little Krishna painting to the village temple and they wanted Salim to draw it.As there is no ban on non-Hindus to go inside the village shrine, the Muslim artist could visit the temple in person and present her artwork to the deity.Interestingly, all her paintings, whether done on canvas or glass, are of only one theme - infant Krishna with his butter pot.The artist said she could draw only little Lord Krishna with such perfection and she failed to do other themes with such grace."I do not know the reason...I am actually an accidental artist and have no professional training...I started painting all of a sudden six years ago when I was pregnant and was under bed rest after an accident. I can paint only Lord Krishna with perfection," Salim said.When she drew the first painting of the Hindu deity, her husband advised her to destroy it as it might irk her conservative parents and other relatives.But, Salim said her consciousness did not allow her to do it and so he gifted that to a Namboothiri family living nearby.The family, who had kept that painting in their pooja room, later claimed that many of their wishes had been fulfilled after that."The story of the Muslim woman painting Lord Krishna has spread fast in the area and several people have started approaching me for painting. Many others also claimed that their unfulfilled wishes have been fulfilled after placing it at home. I do not know anything about it," she said.Now, even celebrities are placing orders to get little Krishna paintings from this young artist. Not just from Kerala, but she is getting orders from neighbouring states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu also.She paints at least five to six pictures a month and charges up to Rs 5,000 as per its size."My husband, who is working in Dubai, has been very supportive since the beginning. Majority of his friends are from the Hindu community. Now, my parents have also no objection as they know that I won't deviate from my faith and do anything against my religious principles," the Muslim artist said.The parents only wanted her not to keep the Krishna paintings at home, which she abides by strictly.However, many of her relatives were still not convinced about her artwork."I am not doing anything wrong, so there is no need for me to take their objection seriously. As per my religion, my father and husband's words are of top priority for me. They have no objection to what I am doing, If my paintings are giving happiness to others, why should I stop?" she asked.The woman, who studies up to 10th standard, now has another dream - to gift a Lord Krishna painting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

30-09-2021||New Delhi||Senior Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma slam ‘hooliganism’ outside Kapil Sibal’s house||Senior Congress leaders Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma, along with some of their G-23 colleagues, on Thursday strongly condemned and termed as “orchestrated hooliganism” the Congress workers’ protest outside Kapil Sibal’s house after he raised questions over the party’s functioning, with Sharma asking AICC chief Sonia Gandhi to take strong action against those involved.Also read: ‘No elected Cong chief, don’t know who is taking decisions’: Sibal seeks CWC meeting amid Punjab crisisFormer Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also criticised what he said was an “attack” at the house of Sibal by the Congress workers only because he “chose to express views that were not palatable to the party leadership”.This does not augur well for the party, Singh was quoted as saying by his media adviser Raveen Thukral.Azad, former leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, also strongly condemned the “orchestrated hooliganism” at Sibal’s residence.“He (Sibal) is a loyal Congressman fighting for the party both inside and outside Parliament. Any suggestion from any quarter should be welcomed instead of suppressing, hooliganism is unacceptable,” tweeted Azad, who along with Sibal is part of the ‘Group of 23’ which last year had written to Gandhi seeking organisational overhaul of the party.Asserting that differences of opinion and perception are integral to a democracy, Sharma, also a part of the G-23, said intolerance and violence is alien to Congress values and culture.“Shocked and disgusted to hear the news of attack and hooliganism at Kapil Sibal’s house. This deplorable action brings disrepute to the party and needs to be strongly condemned,” Sharma said in a series of tweets.He asserted that the Congress has a history of upholding freedom of expression.Those responsible must be identified and disciplined, Sharma said.“Urging Congress president Sonia Gandhi to take cognisance and strong action,” he said in a tweet.Taking to Twitter, Congress MP from Punjab, Manish Tewari, unequivocally condemned what he said was “orchestrated hooliganism” at Sibal’s residence last night.“Those who masterminded the assault must bear in mind that he fights for @INCIndia both inside and outside courts of law. You may find his views uncomfortable but that can not be a license for violence,” Tewari, who was among the 23 leaders who wrote to Gandhi for an overhaul of the party, said.In another tweet, he said, “Those who are trying to defend the ‘command performance’ last night. This is what happened @KapilSibal’s house ‘They damaged the car. Stood on top, so it caved in. Threw tomatoes both outside and inside the house’. If this is not hooliganism then what else is it”.Responding to Tewari’s tweet, Tharoor, who was part of the leaders who wrote to Gandhi, tweeted, “That is shameful. We all know @KapilSibal as a true Congressman who has fought multiple cases in court for @INCIndia.”      “As a democratic party we need to listen to what he has to say,disagree if you must but not in this way. Our priority is to strengthen ourselves to take on the BJP!” Tharoor said.Also responding to Tewari’s tweet, Congress leader Vivek Tankha tweeted, “Never to a person who has fought and saved so many Cong governments and persons and unmake opposition government.”“People may disagree with him. Even protest. But not damage his car. At least in my life I never encouraged or promoted hooliganism,” Tankha said.Hours after he raised questions over the functioning of the Congress, Sibal on Wednesday came under attack from several quarters with party workers also protesting outside his house here.In the wake of several Congress leaders quitting the party and its Punjab unit in turmoil, Sibal has demanded that an immediate meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) be convened and wondered who in the party was taking decisions in the absence of a full-time president.Sibal said at a press conference that the G-23 grouping is “not a Jee Huzur 23” and will continue to put forth the views and will continue to repeat the demands.Carrying ‘Get Well Soon Kapil Sibal’ placards and raising slogans against Sibal, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) workers had protested outside his Jor Bagh residence, saying they were “hurt” by his remarks.The protesters raised slogans against Sibal, asking him to “leave the party”. A protestor also stood on his car. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/senior-congress-leaders-ghulam-nabi-azad-anand-sharma-slam-hooliganism-outside-kapil-sibals-house-318247

As of now there is a suspense in both the camps -- one led by Chief Minister Baghel and the other led by state Health Minister TS Singhdeo.Mohan Markam, the state Congress President had said the party was busy in the preparation of Rahul Gandhi's visit to Sarguja and Bastar, both tribal belts, and Sarguja is also the stronghold of T.S. Singhdeo. Markam had said he was head of the organisation in the state and does not belong to any camp.However, dates of the visit of the former Congress President have not been not finalised yet, but he may go on the onset of the second week of October and get a sense of state politics.The supporters of Singhdeo have been pushing for a change of guard since incumbent Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel completed 2.5 years in office. Suspense still looms on the issue of rotational chief minister as there is no clarity from the top  leadership of the party.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-crisis-in-punjab-congress-chhattisgarh-mlas-reach-delhi-318245

30-09-2021||Kolkata||Polling ‘peaceful’ in Bengal’s Bhabanipur, moderate turnout recorded||A moderate turnout was recorded in the by-election to the Bhabanipur assembly seat, where West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is contesting to retain her post, as polling in the high-profile constituency in south Kolkata passed off peacefully on Thursday.Around 53.32 per cent turnout was recorded in the seat till 5 pm. The Election Commission said that the final turnout till 6 pm will be available on Friday.A high voting rate at 78.60 per cent and 76.12 per cent was recorded in Murshidabad’s Samserganj and Jangipur seats respectively, where polls had to be countermanded during the April-May assembly elections following the death of two candidates.A total of 6,97,164 voters were eligible to exercise their franchise in the three constituencies.Banerjee, who is also the Trinamool Congress supremo, is pitted against BJP’s Priyanka Tibrewal and CPI(M)’s Srijib Biswas in Bhabanipur. Banerjee, a voter of the constituency, cast her vote at Mitra Institution school in the area.Sporadic incidents of scuffles between the BJP and TMC supporters were reported from some areas of the constituency.Tibrewal claimed that the TMC forcibly stopped the voting process at a polling booth in ward number 72, and that state minister Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee were trying to influence the voters in the constituency.The BJP has lodged a complaint with the EC against Hakim and Mukherjee.Hakim, however, termed the allegations as baseless. “Does having tea at a roadside stall tantamount to influencing voters? The BJP knows it will lose the by-poll and are now making lame excuses,” he said.A minor scuffle between supporters of the TMC and BJP was reported outside a booth in Bhabanipur over allegations that the ruling party was bringing fake voters inside the polling centre. Security forces brought the situation under control.The TMC also registered a complaint with the EC, accusing Tibrewal of moving with an entourage of 20 cars and intimidating voters, a charge denied by her.The BJP later alleged that its polling agents were not allowed entry inside several booths.Hakim said such claims were politically motivated.In another incident, BJP leader Kalyan Chaubey’s car was allegedly ransacked on Sarat Bose Road. Incidentally, Chaubey was working as the election agent of Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular candidate Satadru Roy.The Kolkata Police submitted a report to the EC regarding the incident, following which the poll body rubbished the allegations of it being a political attack.In Samserganj, bombs were hurled a few hours before voting started at 7 am. The TMC had accused the Congress of carrying out the attack, a charge the grand old party dubbed as baseless.The Congress has demanded a re-poll in nine booths of Samserganj constituency.The EC has received 97 complaints so far, out of which 91 has been quashed. Out of these 97 complaints, 85 were related to the Bhabanipur by-poll.The BJP took a dig at the TMC over the low turnout in Bhabanipur, saying that the ruling party’s campaign of projecting the by-election as a precursor to the 2024 Lok Sabha polls to defeat the saffron party was not endorsed by the electorate.“What will happen to Mamata Banerjee’s ambition to project herself as an alternative to Narendra Modi in the 2024 elections? She had described Bhabanipur as mini-India which will show the country how to fight BJP by turning out in large numbers to vote and elect her by a huge margin,” party spokesperson Shamik Bhattacharya said.He wondered what would happen to the “claims of different TMC leaders that Mamata Banerjee will win by a margin of over 1 lakh votes.”Reacting to the BJP’s statement, Hakim said the saffron camp should be more worried about securing its deposit.“They should be worried about whether they would be able to secure their deposit or will have to forfeit it,” he said.The chief minister, who lost from the Nandigram constituency in the assembly elections earlier this year, has to win this by-poll to retain the post.Votes will be counted on October 3.

Article 129 of the Constitution declares: “The Supreme Court shall be a court of record and shall have all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for contempt of itself.” Article 215 makes a similar declaration with regard to high courts’ power of contempt.“We have little doubt that what the contemnor has been endeavouring is to have his way or, alternatively, I will throw mud at all and sundry, whether it be the court, its administrative staff or the state government so that people, apprehensive of this mud thrown, may back off. We refuse to back off and are clear in our view that we must take it to its logical conclusion,” the top court said.Holding that Daiya was clearly guilty of contempt of court, the Bench said, “His actions to scandalise the court cannot be countenanced. He continues with his contumacious behaviour. The apologies submitted by him are only endeavours to get out of the consequences again followed by another set of allegations, thus, a charade.”Maintaining that it was not mandated to give Daiya a hearing on the issue of sentence, the top court said it would still give him one more chance on the question of final sentence and posted the matter for hearing on October 7.Daiya had sought recall of the top court’s 2017 verdict imposing a fine of Rs 25 lakh for filing 64 PILs and “repeatedly misusing” its jurisdiction and wasting judicial time. He had said he didn’t have the resources to shell out such a huge amount and that he would approach the President with a mercy plea.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-even-legislature-cant-curtail-power-of-contempt-318056

The rest would be need based, he added.When asked about the timeline for issuing IPO, Goyal said, the government would start the process to list the state-owned entity soon and hopefully the company would hit the market during the next financial year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cabinet-okays-listing-of-ecgc-to-infuse-rs-4-400-cr-318059

As the high court’s orders were applicable only till July 17, the Bench refrained from formally quashing them even as it allowed the appeal against the said orders.The SC had in May stayed a Rajasthan High Court’s controversial order restraining the police from arresting accused charged under offence punishable with a maximum sentence of up to three years till July 17 and not to list pre-arrest bail applications before the High Court as well as sessions court. In a rare move, the Rajasthan High Court itself had approached the Supreme Court against its own single judge’s order to the DGP not to arrest such accused. The HC had challenged the order on the ground that the direction will “create a situation of lawlessness” and that it ignored the settled principle of law that Chief Justice is the “Master of Roster” of the HC.The single judge “erroneously violated” the principle of law, rulings and conventions by “interfering into the exclusive administrative jurisdiction of the Chief Justice”, the Rajasthan High Court submitted through its Registrar General.What the apex court saidA Bench of Justice LN Rao and Justice Aniruddha Bose said the order potentially violated constitutional rights of individuals by putting fetters on power of investigation of the police.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-raps-rajasthan-high-court-for-preventing-some-arrests-during-lockdown-318064

Afghanistan airspace was declared "uncontrolled" by the CAA on August 16.In a letter dated September 7, 2021, CAA's Acting Minister Alhaj Hameedullah Akhunzada requested the DGCA to permit commercial flights of Ariana Afghan airline and Kam Air between India and Afghanistan.Akhunzada stated in his letter: "As you are well informed that recently the Kabul airport was damaged and (left) dysfunctional by American troops before their withdrawal." With the help of technical assistance by Qatar, the airport became operational once again and a NOTAM (notice to airmen) in this regard was issued on September 6, he noted."The intention of this letter is to keep the smooth passenger movement between two countries based on signed MoU and our national carriers (Ariana Afghan airline and Kam Air) aim to commence their scheduled flights," he said.Therefore, Afghanistan CAA requests you to facilitate their commercial flights, Akhunzada noted."The civil aviation of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan avails its highest assurance," he added.As a neighbour of Afghanistan, India is naturally concerned about the recent changes in that country and their implications for the region, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla had said on September 20.He demanded that Afghan territory should not be used for sheltering, training, planning or financing terrorist acts.

The personal touch of the meeting makes it important and reveals possibilities of Capt’s future entry into the BJP, which does not have a face in Punjab.Equally important is the timing of the meeting, scheduled a day after Shah met BJP in-charge of Punjab Tarun Chugh.Amarinder Singh, who was unceremoniously forced out of the Punjab CM’s position to pander to state Congress chief Navjot Sidhu’s ambitions, had said at the time of resigning that he was readying for a battle and would do “whatever it takes to keep Sidhu from becoming CM”.Capt’s clarion call against Sidhu implied that all his future options were open.Sources privy to the Capt-Shah meeting said the ground for the engagement had been laid in advance and the two leaders could well discuss a possible meeting ground for a future political alignment.A major issue of convergence for the two sides is Capt’s nationalistic credentials which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has publicly praised more than once and the ongoing farmers’ agitation where Capt Amarinder can play a role.The discussions between the leaders also veered around Punjab’s security given the crisis in the state government, with Sidhu resigning followed by another minister Razia Sultana putting in her papers.The BJP today already questioned the Punjab Congress crisis saying it was causing instability in a sensitive border state, a stand Capt has taken for long terming Sidhu “dangerous and unstable”, and questioning his links with Pakistan PM Imran Khan.Sources said if Capt and Shah agreed on the terms of engagement, especially in respect of the farm agitation, the former Punjab CM could meet PM Modi soon, clearing the path for his formal entry into the BJP.The BJP had yesterday said the meeting with Capt was not ruled out.Sources close to Capt Amarinder today said all options were open, as the former CM had said when he resigned recently.If Capt Amarinder enters BJP, the entire electoral landscape of Punjab would change with the BJP suddenly finding a face and ground.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-saga-capt-amarinder-meets-amit-shah-in-delhi-sets-stage-for-new-poll-equations-317902
30-09-2021||Washington||22 Republican senators introduce legislation to impose sanctions on Taliban, countries supporting it||Twenty-two Republican senators have introduced legislation in the Senate to impose sanctions on the Taliban in Afghanistan and on all the foreign governments that support the hardline Islamic group that seized power in Kabul.The ‘Afghanistan Counterterrorism, Oversight and Accountability Act’ was introduced by Senator Jim Risch, a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Tuesday.The legislation also seeks a report from the Secretary of State about his assessment of the role of Pakistan in supporting the Taliban from 2001-2020; in the offensive that led to the toppling of the Government of Afghanistan and the looking into the Pakistan support for Taliban offensive against Panjshir Valley and Afghan resistance.It also seeks a presidential report in identification of areas where the US can strengthen diplomatic, economic and defence cooperation with India to address economic and security challenges posed by China, Russia and the Taliban in the region, and an assessment of how the changes to India’s security environment resulting from the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan will affect US’ engagement with India.“We continue to see the grave implications of the Biden administration’s haphazard withdrawal from Afghanistan,” Risch said after introducing the bill on the Senate floor.“An unknown number of American citizens and Afghan partners remain abandoned in Afghanistan under threat from the Taliban. We face a renewed terror threat against the United States, and the Taliban wrongly seek recognition at the United Nations, even as they suppress the rights of Afghan women and girls,” he noted.The Taliban swept across Afghanistan last month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities in the backdrop of withdrawal of the US forces that began on May 1. On August 15, the capital city of Kabul fell to the insurgents.The Taliban claimed victory over opposition forces in the last holdout province of Panjshir on September 6, completing their takeover of Afghanistan three weeks after capturing Kabul.The legislation introduced by the 22 senators also requires strategies for counterterrorism and for the disposition of Taliban-captured US equipment and sanctions the Taliban and others in Afghanistan for terrorism, drug-trafficking, and human rights abuses. It authorises sanctions on those providing support to the Taliban, including foreign governments.It states that the United States should not recognise any member of the Taliban as the ambassador of Afghanistan to the United States or as the ambassador of Afghanistan to the United Nations. The legislation calls for a comprehensive review of foreign assistance to entities that support the Taliban.The legislation further urges a report from the President on detailed description of the security and economic challenges that the Russian Federation, the People’s Republic of China, and the Taliban pose to the countries of South and Central Asia, including border disputes with South and Central Asian countries that border China, investments China in land and sea ports, military activities and installations, transportation infrastructure, and energy projects across the region. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/22-republican-senators-introduce-legislation-to-impose-sanctions-on-taliban-countries-supporting-it-317900
30-09-2021||Aditi Tandon||‘No elected Cong chief, don’t know who is taking decisions’: Sibal seeks CWC meeting amid Punjab crisis||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 29As the Congress implodes in Punjab and exodus of leaders continues, party veteran Kapil Sibal weighed in on what he described as a “heartbreaking” situation and called for a meeting of the working committee for threadbare decisions on the goings-on.Noting that the crises in Punjab Congress was advantageous to ISI, Sibal, speaking for all his G23 colleagues on Wednesday, said he didn’t know who was taking decisions as there was no elected party president.Read alsoThe former minister called for an internal dialogue on sliding Congress image and prospects saying G23 was for strengthening the Congress and would never leave the party ideology.“In our party at the moment there is no president.So we don’t know who’s taking decisions. We know yet we don’t know. A senior colleague has asked for the CWC to be convened so that what we can’t speak publicly we can have a dialogue as to why we are in this state,” said Sibal in the first formal interaction by any leader of the G23 that has asked for internal elections in August 2020.Sibal cited Mahatma Gandhi to say there should not be any monopolies in party structures and conversations should be encouraged.“We are not those who will leave the ideology of the party and go elsewhere. It is ironic that closest of their aides have left and those they thought were not theirs are still with the party and are seeking to strengthen it,” the veteran said, noting with “heart break” a continuing stream of defections from the party and asking the Congress to introspect why people are leaving.“I am speaking on the behalf of like-minded Congress men who wrote a letter last year and are awaiting actions by the leadership in respect of election to the post of president, the CWC and the central election committee.I stand here today with a very heavy heart. I belong to a party with a historic legacy, a party that has through its efforts won us freedom, a party whose leadership in the past we could be proud of. And I can’t see my party in the situation it is today,” lamented Sibal.He said it “breaks his heart” to see the Congress in its present state when the country is facing serious challenges which only the Congress can battle.Citing the reported Chinese infiltration in Uttarakhand,the Afghanistan situation which presents a great danger to JK, the “squandered” PM visit to the US, poverty, and unemployment, Sibal said, “And in that state for the Congress to be in this state saddens me. We are the ones that have to fight together against the government which has no legitimacy to function even for a day but what’s happening?”“People are leaving us,” rued Sibal mentioning the recent exits of Sushmita Dev, VM Sudheeran, Jitin Prasada, Jyotiraditya Scindia, late president Pranab Mukherjee’s son Abhijit and Lalitesh Tripathi in UP.The Congress leader said while the defectors could be criticised for leaving, “Congress must introspect why they left, whether there was some fault on our part.”He urged everyone in the Congress to think of how to take the party forward and strengthen it and appealed to those who have left to come back. “Congress alone can save this republic because the present dispensation is destroying the very foundations of the republic. For this to happen we need an open dialogue, conversations, we need to understand each other’s point of view,” Sibal said.On Punjab, the veteran lamented that a border state where this (the current crisis after PCC chief Navjot Sidhu’s resignation) is happening to the Congress is advantage Pakistan’s ISI.“We know the history of Punjab and the rise of extremism there. We know how forces across the border create instability. Congress should make sure they remain united. If someone has an issue it should be discussed and the conversation must take place from the seniormost member of the party. That will take place if there is an elected president, an elected CWC, if the structure is strengthened bottom up,” the leader noted.He quoted Mahatma Gandhi to call for conversations on the way forward and said “We are all liable to err…In a vast country like this there should be room for all schools of thought. No monopolies should be created in power structures of the country or a party,” Sibal said in some plain speaking to Congress, which is rapidly losing ground in Punjab, one of the only three states where it’s in power on its own.He said the G23 was not against any individual (Rahul Gandhi) and only wanted to strengthen the party.“Listen to our point of view. If you don’t accept it, that’s fine but at least listen. We respect your point of view. Allow us a dialogue,” Sibal urged Sonia Gandhi, at a time when Rahul Gandhi, currently calling the shots, has taken a position that “those who wish to leave the Congress and fear the BJP can leave”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-elected-cong-chief-dont-know-who-is-taking-decisions-sibal-seeks-cwc-meeting-amid-punjab-crisis-317892
30-09-2021||New Delhi||Court’s power of contempt can’t be taken away even by legislative enactment, says Supreme Court||Observing that the court’s power of contempt can’t be taken away even by a legislative enactment, the Supreme Court on Wednesday held the chairperson of an NGO guilty of contempt for not depositing Rs 25 lakh for “scandalising and browbeating” the court.“We are of the view that the contemnor is clearly guilty of contempt of court and his action to scandalise the court cannot be countenanced,” the top court said.A Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh said the chairperson of NGO, Suraz India Trust, Rajiv Daiya has been “throwing mud” at all and sundry including the court, administrative staff and the state government.“The power to punish for contempt is a constitutional power vested with this court which cannot be taken away even by a legislative enactment,” the court said.The top court issued notice to Daiya and directed him to be present on October 7 for hearing of the sentence.With regard to recovery of money, the Bench said it can take place as arrears of land revenue.The top court had issued contempt notice to Daiya as to why he should not be proceeded against and sentenced for his endeavour to scandalise the court.Daiya had told the Bench that he did not have the resources to pay the costs imposed by the apex court and would approach the President of India with a mercy plea.The apex court was hearing an application filed by Daiya seeking recall of the apex court’s 2017 judgment by which it had imposed costs of Rs 25 lakh on it for filing 64 PILs over the years without any success and “repeatedly misusing” the jurisdiction of the top court.

30-09-2021||Stockholm||Indian organisation shares Alternative Nobel with 3 others||An Indian organisation is among four activists and groups which are awarded this year’s Right Livelihood Award, known as the ‘Alternative Nobel’, on Wednesday for empowering communities in areas ranging from child protection to environmental defence.The Swedish Right Livelihood Foundation, which awards the prize, said that “in the face of the worsening climate crisis, powerful governmental and corporate interests, and even a terrorist threat, the 2021 Laureates prove that solidarity is key to a better future for all.”            The 2021 Right Livelihood Laureates are leaders in advancing the rights of women and girls, environmental protection and reclaiming Indigenous rights through mobilising communities and empowering grassroots initiatives.“Hailing from Cameroon, Russia, Canada and India, this year’s change-makers show that lasting change is built on communities banding together,” it said.Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment (LIFE), an organisation working to protect the environment in India through the creative use of law and legal processes, was among the winners.LIFE works with communities through a grassroots approach. It assists and empowers often vulnerable populations to stand up against powerful interests and have a voice in the decision-making process, while also strengthening institutions and reforming laws.Noticing a lack of judicial access on environmental issues, LIFE was founded by lawyers Ritwick Dutta and Rahul Choudhary in 2005.Today, the organisation’s attorneys are among India’s leading public interest lawyers. “The award will help us increase the impact of our work, empowering more people to protect nature and livelihoods,” Dutta, co-founder of LIFE, said.The other winners are Freda Huson, a Canadian indigenous rights campaigner, Marthe Wandou, a Cameroonian woman fighting sexual violence against girls, and Vladimir Slivyak, a Russian environmental campaigner. Created in 1980, the annual Right Livelihood Award honours efforts that the prize founder, Swedish-German philanthropist Jakob von Uexkull, felt were being ignored by the Nobel prizes.The winners will each receive prize money of 1 million kronor (USD 115, 520) and will be honoured during a virtual award ceremony on December 1.The foundation said that a record number of 206 nominees from 89 countries were considered in 2021.
