18-09-2021||Shahjahanpur (UP)||Will continue to protest till farm laws are withdrawn: Rakesh Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Saturday said the farmers will continue to protest at Delhi’s borders till the three controversial agriculture laws are withdrawn.He alleged a nexus between the central government and corporates to “rob” the farmers of their rights.Till the black laws are not withdrawn, the farmers will remain on the borders of Delhi, Tikait, who is the national spokesperson of the BKU, said, adding the farmers were now aware of their rights.He alleged that the government was not sensitive towards protecting the rights of the farmers and said time has come for the “farmer warriors to shake the roots of the government”.Tikait and other farmer leaders had come to Bunda tehsil here on the occasion of the 38th death anniversary of Sant Sukhdev Singh to pay homage to him.National president of BKU (Charuni faction) Gurnam Singh Charuni termed the farmers’ movement as a “dharam yudh” being fought to safeguard the rights of the peasants.The intention of the government is to enslave the farmers which will not be allowed under any circumstances, he said.On the occasion, the leaders of about half a dozen farmers’ unions asked the farmers to reach Delhi on their call.Recently, Tikait had led a massive farmers’ mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar to put pressure on the central government to withdraw the three farm laws.He has already announced that he will work to ensure the defeat of the BJP in the upcoming UP elections on the issue of three legislations.

Any booking done on 20th September for travel on or after 5th October shall not be controlled by fare bands.” “On the following day, that is, if the current date is 21st September, then the fare band shall be in force till 5th October and for travel on or after 6th October, the fare bands shall not be applicable,” the order mentioned.So, the fare bands will shift by a day every day, it added. India had imposed lower and upper limits on airfares based on flight duration when services were resumed on May 25, 2020, after a two-month Covid-triggered lockdown.The lower caps were imposed to help the airlines that have been struggling financially due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. The upper caps were imposed so that passengers are not charged huge amounts when the demand for seats is high.Domestic air travel became costlier on August 12 this year as the Civil Aviation Ministry had raised the lower as well as upper caps on fares by 9.83 to 12.82 per cent.For example, the ministry on August 12 increased the lower limit for flights under 40 minutes of duration from Rs 2,600 to Rs 2,900 -- an increase of 11.53 per cent. The upper cap for flights under 40 minutes of duration was increased by 12.82 per cent to Rs 8,800.The caps mentioned by the government in its order does not include the passenger security fee, user development fee for the airports and the GST. These charges are added on top when the ticket is being booked by the passenger.The August 12 order also mentioned that the limits on airfares will remain in place for 30 days at any given time.On Saturday, the ministry modified the August 12 order, replacing the word “30 days” with “15 days”.

18-09-2021||New Delhi||Punjab: Could Amarinder's resignation be BJP's chance? Saffron party plays 'wait and watch'||The day turned out to be quite a mixed bag for the ruling BJP. In West Bengal, Asansol MP Babul Supriyo, who until July was among Prime Minister Narendra Modi council of ministers, jumped ship to join its bitter rival, the Trinamool Congress. In Punjab, the resignation of Congress’ Amarinder Singh presented what could potentially be an opportunity to capture a state that has so far resisted the saffron wave.Capt Amarinder Singh's move has opened doors for the BJP in a poll-bound year. Punjab’s a state where its stakes are low and where, with the Akalis no longer allies, its chances to make government are limited. It is also a state that’s played a major role in the ongoing farmer protests against the three controversial agriculture laws passed by the Centre.Observers see Captain’s resignation as an unexpected opportunity for the BJP to lift its head in a state where it has so far been unable to stand on its own.“Only his age and the three contentious legislations stand between the two (BJP and Amarinder) because Captain’s nationalist image works well for both the party and its ideological fountainhead RSS,” observers say.  Soon after he resigned, Captain Amarinder Singh accused Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu of having “ties with Pakistan” and warned that his “elevation as CM will be a threat to national security”. “Pakistan PM Imran Khan is his friend. Sidhu has a relation with army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa,” Captain Amarinder Singh said on Saturday—words that would come as music to the BJP’s ears.Interestingly, the BJP which slammed the Congress as a “complete failure in all fronts”, steered clear of criticizing Capt Amarinder.The mafia raj of the Congress in Punjab will prove to be the last nail in its coffin in Punjab,” national general secretary Tarun Chugh said, adding that “replacing the CM is a panic reaction of the Congress high command to salvage the party situation after it failed to deliver in the last more than four and a half years”.At 79, Amarinder Singh is beyond the BJP’s unofficial cut-off age for a CM. Whether he is looking for the job or is open to the idea remains to be seen. However, for a party looking for a credible face to support, even if it is from outside, age is an issue that can be easily overlooked. “Punjab is a border state and needs political stability. The (75-year) rule is not cast in stone. Besides, there are always opportunities in politics,” said a BJP leader who did not wish to be named.Singh, who was quoted as saying that he will not join the Akali Dal, also said that he has not decided on “other parties”. His other options could also work well for the BJP and Congress’ other rivals such as the Aam Aadmi Party.  If not a party of his own, Singh can always sit out and act as a spoiler for the Congress. Observers feel the BJP could benefit provided it makes some sacrifices, such as on the three laws, pr perhaps enacts a law on the MSP—the latter being a demand that a sister affiliate in the Sangh, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, has been demanding.  The BKS has been demanding a “stringent law” on Minimum Support Price depending upon the actual cost of production.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-could-amarinders-resignation-be-bjps-chance-saffron-party-plays-wait-and-watch-313013
18-09-2021||Bengaluru||Five of family found dead in Karnataka, girl child rescued||Five members of a family, including a nine-month-old male infant, were found dead at their home here, while a two-and-a-half-year-old girl child has barely survived the trauma and is undergoing treatment, police said.The bodies were discovered from their residence in the city’s Thigalarapalya on Friday night.The incident came to light when the head of the family, Hallegere Shankar, who was away, came home after four days, as his repeated calls to family members had gone unanswered.Police suspect that the deaths might have occurred four days ago, allegedly as part of a suicide pact.The deceased are Shankar’s wife Bharathi (51), daughters Sinchana (34), Sindhurani (31), and son Madhusagar (25), and nine-month-old grandson.While the four adults were found hanging from the ceiling in different rooms, the infant was lying on the bed and might have died of starvation, officials said, adding that the bodies were in a heavily decomposed state.Police have rescued Sinchana’s two-and-a-half-year-old daughter who was found in a state of unconsciousness, due to starvation, and termed her survival as “miracle”.The girl was rushed to a nearby private hospital where she is undergoing treatment and has gained consciousness. Doctors have said her condition is stable, officials said.Apparently, Shankar’s elder daughter had separated from her husband and had been living with the family due to marital issues, while the younger daughter had come for the delivery, sources said.Police are questioning Shankar, who brings out a tabloid, about what might have led the family members to suicide, and his whereabouts for the last four days.Shankar told reporters that there were family issues, and one of his daughters had separated from her husband.Police have registered a case of unnatural death and further investigations are on. They said they are also questioning the neighbours. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/five-of-family-found-dead-in-karnataka-girl-child-rescued-313012
18-09-2021||Kolkata||BJP calls Babul ‘opportunist’; Trinamool says more to follow||Though the Trinamool Congress has overwhelmingly accepted Babul Supriyo in the party, the BJP on Saturday accused their two-time MP from Asansol of betraying not only the party, but also the people of his constituency.The Congress and the CPM, however, termed it as ‘politics of opportunists’.In a surprising turn of events, former Union minister Supriyo, who had to resign from the Union ministry on July 7, joined the Trinamool Congress on Saturday, receiving the Trinamool flag from the party’s national General Secretary Abhishek Banerjee at the latter’s office in South Kolkata.Though the Trinamool hailed the entry of Supriyo into the party, the BJP MP met with severe criticism from his former camp.“Babul Supriyo left the party after he was left without a portfolio and this proves that he was in the party only for gains. Now he is with the Trinamool Congress because, perhaps, they have promised something big. He is an opportunist. He has not only betrayed the party, but also the people of his constituency. One thing I can say is that the BJP will again get an MP from Asansol,” BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya said.Countering Bhattacharya, Trinamool MP and veteran leader Sougata Roy told the media, “After the Assembly elections, four BJP MLAs and one MP have joined the Trinamool Congress and more are likely to follow. There are many big names in the BJP who are waiting. This is the beginning of the end of BJP. No right-thinking people can stay there.” Senior BJP leader and the party’s national secretary Rahul Sinha said, “This is a temporary shock and the BJP will surely get over it.“This cannot be politics. To lure people with money and power or threaten people with police and agencies and bring them into the party fold cannot be healthy politics. The BJP is an organisation-based party that runs on certain ethics and principals. So we are not bothered about it.” “What the BJP did before the elections was ethical politics? They were taking our people and now when the process has reversed, they have suddenly become concerned about ethics and principals. They are getting the same return and they will see it again,” Trinamool Congress spokesperson Kunal Ghosh said.CPM leader Sujan Chakraborty said, “The person who was all praise for Narendra Modi and had accused Mamata Banerjee has suddenly changed colour. Mamata Banerjee has suddenly become an extraordinary leader. Is this politics? This is business. Trinamool Congress has offered him a better bet, so he is with them. If tomorrow any other party offers him something better, it will take two minutes for him to leave Trinamool.” “This is not politics. This is like going to a shop and asking for offers. The shop that gives the best offer, I buy from there. There is neither any ethics nor there is any principle and I find no difference between Trinamool Congress and BJP,” state Congress President Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-calls-babul-opportunist-trinamool-says-more-to-follow-313010
18-09-2021||New Delhi||Forcible conversion: SC quashes case against MP man, says nothing on record||The Supreme Court has quashed criminal proceedings against a man accused of forcible conversion, noting that the person who was stated to have been forced to convert to Christianity has denied the allegation.A bench comprising justices U U Lalit, S Ravindra Bhat and C T Ravikumar set aside the order passed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court which refused to grant any relief to the accused, George Mangalapilly.Apart from the testimony of the witness, there is nothing else on record which could potentially be relied upon against the accused, the apex court noted.“In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and especially when the entire fulcrum of the prosecution rests upon the version of the man who was stated to be forcibly converted, in our view, the testimony of said person assumes great significance,” the bench said.  According to his own version neither was he forcibly converted nor had the appellant contacted him at any juncture, it observed.“In view of these peculiar circumstances, in our view, the appellant is entitled to the relief prayed for. We, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the order passed by the High Court and quash the proceedings against the appellant in respect of offence punishable under Section 3 and 4 of the MP Freedom of Religion Act, 1968 Act,” the bench said.The accused was booked under offences punishable under Sections 153(B)(1) (assertion prejudicial to national integration) and 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the Indian Penal Code and sections 3 and 4 of the M.P. Freedom of Religion Act, 1968.According to the prosecution, the accused had converted Dharmendar Dohar to Christianity in violation of Section 3 of the Act and thereby committed the aforesaid offences.In the trial, Dohar in his examination-in-chief denied that he was converted by the accused.He stated that his signatures were obtained on a piece of paper by certain persons, on the basis of which the prosecution was launched against the accused. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/forcible-conversion-sc-quashes-case-against-mp-man-says-nothing-on-record-313007
18-09-2021||New Delhi||Opposition unity can’t be built by undermining leaders; TMC’s attack on Rahul Gandhi unwarranted: Congress||The Congress accused on Saturday the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress of undermining the leadership of the grand old party and said its attack on Rahul Gandhi was “unwarranted and in poor taste”. The remarks of the Congress came after the TMC’s Bengali mouthpiece ‘Jago Bangla’ ran a cover story, attacking Gandhi by saying he has failed to take on the BJP and Banerjee, who is the chief minister of West Bengal, should be the opposition’s face now.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said he has seen reports citing an article in the official publication of the Trinamool Congress (TMC).The same is not in good taste as Rahul Gandhi—a former Congress president—is fighting a bigger battle to save democracy, he said.“Let me say that Rahul Gandhi and the Congress Party are fighting a bigger battle of saving democracy, protecting the Constitution and our national ethos that are under attack from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP-RSS,” Surjewala said.“We also find the attack on Rahul Gandhi is unwarranted and in poor taste,” he said. Jago Bangla had run the cover story with the headline: ‘Rahul Gandhi failed, Mamata is the alternate face’.Surjewala said the Congress respects all political parties and their leadership and recognises their contribution in the united fight against the BJP. “Everyone must understand that Opposition unity cannot be built by undermining the leadership of other parties, including the Congress Party. In fact, all like-minded parties, including Mamta Banerjee ji, have repeatedly vowed to fight together. Hopefully, those writing such articles will take note of Mamata ji’s and Opposition parties’ stance,” he said.  Congress leader in Lok Sabha and the party’s West Bengal chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the views expressed by TMC’s mouthpiece will weaken the unity and convergence among opposition parties. The article comes at a time when opposition parties are trying to come together and present a united face in fighting and defeating the BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The article in the TMC publication stated that the country is seeking an alternative face.“I have known Rahul Gandhi for a long time, but I must say he has failed to emerge as an alternative face to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But Mamata Banerjee has been successful in emerging as an alternative face to Modi,” the story quoted the TMC’s Lok Sabha party leader Sudip Bandopadhyay as said. Congress leaders have said that this will adversely affect the bonhomie between the Congress and the TMC, and does not bode well for opposition unity.Senior TMC leader Kunal Ghosh on Friday said the party neither intends to disrespect the Congress nor wants to talk about an alternative to the BJP government at the Centre without it.“Bandopadhyay has not talked about any alternative force without the Congress. He just said in his experiences, people are not accepting Rahul Gandhi as an alternative face to Narendra Modi. He (Gandhi) is not ready yet,” Ghosh said.The Congress leader could not prove it (defeating the BJP) in the last two Lok Sabha elections in 2014 and 2019, the state TMC spokesperson said.“But after the 2021 assembly poll victory, Mamata Banerjee has been successful in emerging as an alternative (face to Modi), he said. Veteran Congress leader and MP Pradip Bhattacharya said it is for the opposition allies to unanimously decide who will be their common leader.Banerjee, who has emerged as the doughtiest opposition face after her resounding victory in the West Bengal assembly polls, has been trying to bring together opposition parties to form an alternative force against the BJP government ahead of the next Lok Sabha polls. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-unity-cant-be-built-by-undermining-leaders-tmcs-attack-on-rahul-gandhi-unwarranted-congress-313000

18-09-2021||New Delhi||Covid: As schools reopen, Centre asks states to monitor infection in children||The central government on Saturday asked states to monitor any rising Covid infection trends among children as schools reopen and also augment the public health response infrastructure including medical oxygen plants, ICU and hospital facilities and essential medicine stocking.At a review meeting with states a day after India set a record by delivering 2.27 crore Covid vaccine doses in a day, cabinet secretary Rajeev Gauba said there was no room for complacency.The health ministry flagged 70 districts of concern in 15 states—34 with Covid positivity rate above 10 per cent and 36 between 5 and 10 per cent—and called for strict enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour especially in the wake of upcoming festivities.The Cabinet Secretary advised states to ensure observance of Covid-safe festivities,Implement intensive containment and active surveillance in clusters reporting high cases and not delay the imposition of restrictions, increase testing while maintaining RT-PCR ratio and promptly commission pressure swing absorption plants, oxygen cylinders, concentrators and ventilators.“States were also told to undertake regular reviews for priority implementation of emergency response package II to ensure preparedness with enough headroom, monitor infection spread in children considering that few states have opened schools, monitor breakthrough infections post vaccination and analyse the emerging evidence, monitor mutations including sending sufficient samples for genome sequencing,” the government said.The Centre also asked states to accelerate speed and coverage of vaccination and take necessary measures for the prevention and control of dengue and vector-borne diseases.States were also guided on the control of Serotype-II Dengue in 11 States including Haryana.Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, V. K. Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog and Chief Secretaries, Additional Chief Secretaries (Health), Principal Secretaries (Health), Municipal Commissioners, District Collectors attended the meeting.The meeting hailed the landmark achievement of more than 2.5 crore vaccine doses administered on Saturday.“We hope that with increased availability of vaccine doses, the pace of vaccination will be maintained. There is no room for complacency. There is strict need to enforce Covid Appropriate Behaviour (CAB),” Gauba said.Drawing examples from other countries that saw multiple peaks of Covid-19, the government expressed concern over certain pockets in the country reporting high test positivity and advised states to undertake granular analysis of their Covid trajectory, ramp up their Health Infrastructure, undertake the stocking of essential medicine and augment Human Resources at the earliest, to meet any potential surge in cases.Health Secretary highlighted the emerging challenge of Serotype-II Dengue in 11 States which is associated with more cases and more complications than other forms of the disease. He suggested the states undertake steps like early detection of cases; operationalisation of fever helplines; adequate stocking of testing kits, larvicides and medicines; deployment of Rapid Response teams for prompt investigation and necessary Public Health Action like Fever Survey, Contact Tracing, Vector Control; alerting blood banks for maintaining adequate stocks of blood and blood components, especially platelets.Bhushan also brought to the notice of the states 70 districts in 15 states are a cause of concern as 34 of these districts have positivity exceeding 10 per cent and in 36 districts, the positivity is in the range of 5-10 per cent.“In view of the forthcoming festival season, states were directed to ensure all necessary precautions and effective enforcement for avoidance of mass gathering and congested closed spaces. Existing guidelines regarding malls, local markets, and places of worship are to be strictly followed,” said the Government in a statement.The five-fold Covid Containment Strategy (Test, Treat, Track, Vaccinate, CAB adherence) was underlined.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-as-schools-reopen-centre-asks-states-to-monitor-infection-in-children-312990

This pace is what our country needs," he tweeted.Party leader P Chidambaram said he was happy and grateful that 2.5 crore vaccinations were administered on Friday. "But why did we have to wait until the PM's birthday?" he asked.Suppose the prime minister's birthday was on December 31, would the 2.5 crore vaccinations have been done only on the last day of the year, Chidambaram asked."Vaccination is not like cutting a cake on a birthday. Vaccination is a programme, it is a process. It has to be accelerated every day, not scale a peak on a birthday," he said on Twitter."BJP-ruled states - UP, MP, Gujarat and Karnataka - 'perform' on the PM's birthday and vaccinate many times the daily average. On other days, they are 'non-performing' states."I wish the PM celebrated his birthday every day," the former Union finance minister added.In another tweet, he said, one-third of the adult population was yet to receive its first dose and only 21 per cent had been fully vaccinated.Prime Minister Modi, in a swipe at the opposition, on Saturday said there is talk of fever as a vaccine side-effect, but a political party experienced fever after 2.5 crore vaccines were administered on his birthday.

For every few hundred vaccinations that are given one or two persons report vaccine side-effects. Yesterday we were able to administer 2.5 crore doses, possibly the highest in the world for a single day. But yesterday night after the figure was announced, a political party started showing some adverse reactions. Can you explain this?" Modi said during an online interaction with health workers and ruling politicians and administrative officials from Goa.Modi made the comments during his interaction with Dr Nitin Dhupdale, a lecturer of community medicine at the state's apex health facility, the Goa Medical College.The Prime Minister also congratulated Goa for being a part of the world's biggest vaccination drives, while lauding health workers and the people of Goa completing 100 per cent coverage of the first Covid vaccine.

The section attracts a simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month, or fine up to five hundred rupees or both.The probe agency had issued multiple summonses to Deshmukh in the money laundering case registered against him by it. However, the NCP leader has failed to appear before it so far.Two of Deshmukh’s aides - Sanjeev Palande and Kundan Shinde - have been arrested in the case.

The 71-year-old Deshmukh is already being probed by the CBI for allegation of payment of purported kickbacks in the police establishment of Maharashtra and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on charges of alleged money laundering.The I-T action covers educational institutions run or managed by the former minister or his family members or their close associates, certain offices, and residential premises.The ED case against Deshmukh and others came after the CBI booked him in the corruption case related to allegations of at least Rs 100 crore bribe made by former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh.The former Maharashtra home minister had said that Singh made the allegations against him, as he was removed from the post of Mumbai Police Commissioner. Incidentally, Deshmukh has skipped at least five ED summons for questioning in the case and has instead suggested for the agency to interact with him over an online link saying he was a “law abiding citizen”.Deshmukh resigned in April after the allegations surfaced following the recovery of an explosives-laden SUV parked near the residence of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani.On Thursday, the state government suspended Deshmukh’s former personal secretary Sanjiv Palande — an officer of additional collector rank — after his arrest by the ED on June 26 in the same case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-t-raids-at-premises-linked-to-deshmukh-312736

I make it absolutely clear that this came on today’s agenda purely because of the Kerala High Court order.“Members made it clear they do not want petroleum products to be included under the GST. It was decided, we will report to Kerala HC that matter has been discussed and the council felt it was not the time to bring petroleum products under the GST,’’ said the minister.The GST was also reduced as part of “people friendly” decisions on retro-fitment kits for vehicles used by the differently abled and fortified rice kernels, which can be used in social sector schemes.The life-saving drugs given exemption are not connected with Covid, but are very expensive. For Covid medicines, the extension has been given till the year-end. But the extension for medical equipment related to Covid has ended.In the transport sector, one-year extension has been given for export by vessels and air because of glitches in the GST portal. The National Permit Fee has been exempted from the GST. The IGST payable on import of leased aircraft has been exempted from double taxation but GST on railway parts and locomotives will be increased to correct the inverted duty structure.

18-09-2021||New Delhi||Let’s resolve border row fast, EAM Jaishankar tells China||China should deal with India on merits and avoid viewing its bilateral ties from the perspective of New Delhi’s relations with third countries, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi during an interaction in Bishkek late on Thursday.“India does not believe in the clash of civilisations and considers unity among Asian countries a crucial matter. Asian solidarity would depend on the example set by India-China relations,” the minister said in his second meeting in three months with Wang to resolve the border issue. Jaishankar emphasised that the two sides should work towards early resolution of the border issues because prolongation of the existing situation was negatively impacting the relationship. “The ministers agreed that military and diplomatic officials should meet again and continue their discussions to resolve the remaining issues at the earliest,” said the Indian readout.The Chinese readout said Wang hoped India would meet China “halfway” to shift the situation in eastern Ladakh from “urgent dispute settlement” to regular management and control.China has always been positive in seeking a proper solution to the border issue and the recent meetings between military commanders and diplomats were “earnest and effective”, it added.Significantly, Wang also said India and China should be opportunities of development to each other rather than threats. About $2 billion in potential Chinese FDI is stuck, including a $300 million takeover of the GM car plant in Maharashtra.The Chinese side extensively quoted Jaishankar, especially on his “clash of civilisations” observation as also that India was willing to work with China to comply with the agreements reached by both sides as also within BRICS and SCO.On the specifics of the border dispute, Jaishankar noted “some progress” in the resolution of the remaining border issues in eastern Ladakh after the completion of disengagement in the Gogra area. However, some outstanding issues still needed to be resolved, he added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lets-resolve-border-row-fast-eam-jaishankar-tells-china-312724

The recent developments in Afghanistan will have the greatest impact on neighbouring countries like us,” he told members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) group of countries gathered in Bishkek via a video address.Seeking the central role of the UN in the transition process, PM Modi called on the world community to pay attention to four issues in his first detailed observations on Afghanistan.The first is that the transition of power in Afghanistan is not inclusive and happened without negotiation, raising questions about the acceptability of the new system. The second is that if instability and fundamentalism persist in Afghanistan, it will encourage terrorist and extremist ideologies all over the world. In this respect, the PM suggested a code of conduct to prevent activities like cross-border terrorism and terror-financing as also a system for its enforcement.The third issue is the uncontrolled flow of drugs, illegal weapons and human trafficking. And the fourth is the serious humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.The PM said other extremist groups might also be encouraged to come to power through violence. “All our countries have been the victims of terrorism in the past. And therefore, together, we should ensure that the territory of Afghanistan is not used to spread terrorism in any other country,” he said while calling on SCO member countries to develop strict and agreed norms on the subject.In the future, these norms, based on the principle of zero-tolerance towards terrorism, can become a template for global anti-terror cooperation.The Prime Minister said the RATS (regional anti-terror structure) mechanism of the SCO, which India would chair, could play a constructive role in monitoring these flows and enhancing information-sharing.Reminding that India had provided assistance in every sector from infrastructure to education, the Prime Minister said it was eager to deliver food and medicines to the Afghan people.The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation consists of China, Russia, four Central Asian countries, India and Pakistan. Iran has been admitted during the ongoing summit. The CSTO, a military treaty organisation, consists of Russia, four Central Asian states, Belarus and Armenia while Azerbaijan and Georgia have left it.India dissociates from Bishkek Declaration’s mention of BRI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/citing-afghanistan-at-sco-modi-pitches-for-template-to-combat-radicalisation-312722

Krishna contended it was beyond imagination that despite the passing of more than six years from the date of filing of chargesheet and taking of cognizance, even the charges had not been framed till date.The FIR in question was registered in 2012 by Krishna at police station Jaani in Meerut district against the respondents for cheating, criminal breach of trust, forgery of valuable security, will, and forging documents/electronic records under the IPC at Meerut with regard to a land deal. Later, the case was transferred to Dehradun as major properties and documents mentioned in the FIR related to district Dehradun.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dehradun-court-gives-78-adjournments-in-7-years-in-cheating-case-312565
18-09-2021||---||Afghanistan proof that radicalisation key challenge to peace: PM Modi at SCO meet||New Delhi, September 17Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the recent developments in Afghanistan have shown that increasing radicalisation is the “root cause” of the biggest challenges to peace and security in the region.Speaking virtually at the summit meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Bishkek, PM Modi also called for enhancing connectivity between land-locked Central Asia and India.In a jibe at the China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which passes through Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK), the PM noted that connectivity projects should be transparent and must respect the territorial integrity of all countries.In line with this approach, India disassociated itself from a paragraph in the SCO’s Bishkek Declaration that reaffirmed support for China’s One Belt and Road Initiative (OBOR).  Support from other countries was smoothened by President Xi Jinping’s announcement of a 30 billion credit for countries on the OBOR route.Among fresh initiatives, the SCO decided to set up its own development bank providing long-term finance for infrastructure projects and will be the third such multilateral institution after the NDB and AIIB to be independent of the US-controlled IMF, World Bank and ADB.It also decided to create a mechanism for meeting of Energy Ministers of SCO Member States, who are split between major energy supplies and consumers.In a hint at the Taliban to form a broad-base government, the SCO used strong language to recommend an inclusive government with representatives from all ethnic, religious and political groups of Afghan society.The meeting approved the full membership of Iran and inclusion of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Qatar as new dialogue partners.The SCO Declaration also made an important mention about checking terrorism by implementing existing global standards on the financing of terrorism. Indian has consistently kept Pakistan in the eye of the global money laundering watchdog FATF which has kept it on a special watch list for the past couple of years.The sidelines of SCO also hummed with activity. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar interacted with Iran’s new President and Foreign Minister as well as Sergei Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister.Also on the sidelines, the Quad of Russia, China, Pakistan and Iran issued a joint statement on Afghanistan which called for a broad-based and inclusive political framework. The Chinese President too asked Kabul to adopt “prudent and moderate’’ domestic and foreign policies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/afghanistan-proof-that-radicalisation-key-challenge-to-peace-pm-modi-at-sco-meet-312551
