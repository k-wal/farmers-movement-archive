17-09-2021||New Delhi||Farm laws protests: Govt digs in heels while BJP successfully manages to make the day all about Covid vaccination||Last year this day, the Lok Sabha passed the contentious farm laws, which the Narendra Modi government said were “aimed at transforming agriculture in the country and raising farmers’ income”.After a tumultuous year of widespread protests, farmers and BJP’s rivals today again registered their opposition to the three laws on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday, the day the ruling party celebrates as “Sewa Divas”.However, the BJP and the party-led government successfully managed to turn PM’s birthday into yet another landmark for his government.As the country administered record Covid doses to mark the day, BJP president JP Nadda said “crores of party karyakartas supported the mass corona vaccination programme across the country”.“We all wish and pray that Narendra Modi ji’s journey of making India a ‘Vishwaguru’ is fulfilled soon and we all should pledge to strengthen his hands and work tirelessly to achieve the goals,” Nadda said, enumerating all his accomplishments as the prime minister of the country.Meanwhile, making clear the government’s stance on the issue, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said “to encourage the next generation to invest in agriculture and to ensure profitable yields for the crops, new farm laws have been enacted”.“The government is going to spend Rs 6,850 crore to set up 10,000 new Farmers’ Producing Organisations (FPOs) and as a result the lives of about 86 per cent of farmers would be transformed,” Tomar added, inaugurating the “Nutri-Cereal Multi-Stakeholders’ Mega Convention 3.0” in Hyderabad.Farmers and BJP’s rivals, including Punjab’s Akali Dal and AAP, today observed “black day” while the Indian Youth Congress celebrated PM’s 71st birthday as “National Unemployment Day”, alleging that his government had been “lying for the past seven years in the name of employment”.The BJP, which launched ‘Sewa aur Samarpan’ campaign on the day, will organise various programmes like blood donation camps, medical camps, cleanliness drive, free ration distribution and other help and assistance to poor and needy over the next two weeks.October 7 also marks PM Modi’s 20 years in public life since he became chief minister of Gujarat in 2001.Inaugurating the campaign, Nadda said it is a matter of pride for the country and BJP workers to have PM Modi as a guiding personality.“We are being led and guided by a great personality whose entire life is devoted towards the preservation and promotion of India’s rich cultural diversity and heritage,” he said.Nadda said since his childhood as ‘Bal Swayamsewak’ till today as the ‘Pradhan Sewak’, PM Modi “strived and worked for the welfare of poor, oppressed, backward and needy sections of the society and worked tirelessly for their upliftment” and “accomplished important tasks for the country and the people which were so far considered impossible”.“He also changed the thought process of every Indian and transformed India’s political work culture.“Indian politics was earlier plagued with casteism, dynasticism, appeasement and nepotism. All this has now changed. He has evolved as a reformer who passionately raises social issues plaguing India and then effectively addresses through public participation,” Nadda added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-laws-protests-govt-digs-in-heels-while-bjp-successfully-manages-to-make-the-day-all-about-covid-vaccination-312576

A lockdown had to be imposed and more than 40 lakh migrant workers and labourers returned to the state during the lockdown.“During this period, traditional artisans, craftsmen and entrepreneurs developed a system, which along with making them self-reliant, also gave impetus to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s concept of making a self-reliant India,” Adityanath said.He said the state’s population is 24 crore and the unemployment rate in UP is far lower as compared to other states of the country.In the year 2016, the unemployment rate in the state was more than 17 per cent, but today it has come down to only four to five per cent, the CM added.According to a statement released by the state government on Friday, 21,000 beneficiaries received toolkits and 11,000 beneficiaries were disbursed loans under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.Adityanath said this year, on the occasion of Deepotsav, the target is to light 7.5 lakh diyas in Ayodhya and these lamps are being manufactured in Ayodhya itself.He further added that on October 6, Modi will complete 20 years of public service as chief minister and prime minister.Modi has given a new direction to the country with his leadership ability. His public services are being commemorated by the Uttar Pradesh government from September 17 to October 7, in the form of Vikas Utsav, the priest-turned-politician announced. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ups-unemployment-rate-was-more-than-17-in-2016-today-it-is-just-4-5-adityanath-312566
17-09-2021||London||2 Indian projects among 15 finalists for Prince William’s Earthshot Prize||A 14-year-old Tamil Nadu schoolgirl’s solar-powered ironing cart project and a Delhi entrepreneur’s agricultural waste recycling concept were on Friday named among 15 finalists from hundreds of nominations across the world for the first-ever Earthshot Prize, launched by Britain’s Prince William last year.Vinisha Umashankar made the cut within the “Clean Our Air” category with her concept of a solar-powered clean alternative to the charcoal-powered street irons that press clothes for millions of Indians each day.Takachar, co-founded by Vidyut Mohan, has also been nominated in the same category for its cheap, small-scale, portable technology that converts crop residues into sellable bio-products.They both will now receive tailored support and resources from the Earthshot Prize Global Alliance Members, a network of private sector businesses around the world who will help scale the shortlisted solutions.“I am honoured to introduce the 15 innovators, leaders, and visionaries who are the first ever finalists for The Earthshot Prize. They are working with the urgency required in this decisive decade for life on Earth and will inspire all of us with their optimism in our ability to rise to the greatest challenges in human history,” said Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge.“Over half a century ago, President Kennedy’s ‘Moonshot’ programme united millions of people around the goal of reaching the moon. Inspired by this, the Earthshot Prize aims to mobilise collective action around our unique ability to innovate, problem solve and repair our planet,” he said.One day, on the way home from school, Vinisha saw an ironing vendor dumping charcoal in the garbage, which led her to research the impact of charcoal. She saw how smoke causes lung disease among vendors and was shocked to learn of the connection between charcoal and deforestation – each year industrial quantities of trees are felled to make charcoal.The Earthshot Prize analysts note: “Vinisha’s solar powered cart replaces dirty charcoal with clean energy from the sun. Five hours of sunshine powers the iron for six hours – a win for the environment is also a win for vendors. Extra mobility means they can sell on doorsteps as well as the roadside.“Built in phone top up and charging points bring extra income too. Overall, the ironing cart helps 13 of the 15 UN Sustainable Development Goals.”             The schoolgirl now plans to manufacture the solar ironing cart in India and sell it at an affordable price and also wants to export it to Asia, Africa and wherever the sun shines throughout the year.“Vinisha’s example shows that by innovating today, the next generation can create a cleaner tomorrow,” the prize analysts said.Vidyut Mohan’s social enterprise Takachar was picked for its efforts to combat the very serious health impact on people in Delhi and its surrounding areas from the burning of agricultural waste, a leading cause of air pollution and reduced life expectancy.The prize analysts note: “Takachar has developed a cheap, small-scale, portable technology that attaches to tractors in remote farms. The machine converts crop residues into sellable bio-products like fuel and fertilizer.“Takachar’s technology reduces smoke emissions by up to 98 per cent which will help improve the air quality that currently reduces the affected population’s life expectancy by up to five years. If scaled, it could cut a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year: a win for India’s farmers will be a win in the fight against climate change.”          Vinisha and Vidyut, along with 13 other finalists from countries such as Bangladesh, China, Nigeria, Costa Rica, Switzerland, are now in with a chance of winning GBP 1 million to support their innovative environmental solutions to some of the greatest challenges facing the planet.Over 750 nominations were screened as part of an independent assessment process run by Deloitte, the prize’s implementation partner, with longlisted nominations then assessed by a global Expert Advisory Panel.Five of these 15 finalists announced will be awarded the Earthshot Prize across five categories: Protect and Restore Nature; Clean our Air; Revive our Oceans; Build a Waste-free World; and Fix our Climate.The winners will be announced at an awards ceremony on October 17 at Alexandra Palace in London. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-indian-projects-among-15-finalists-for-prince-williams-earthshot-prize-312563

17-09-2021||New Delhi||R-day violence: Court grants anticipatory bail to gangster-activist Lakha Sidhana||A Delhi court on Friday granted anticipatory bail to gangster-turned-social activist Lakha Sidhana in a case related to allegedly attempting to kill police personnel and instigating the mob to break barricades during the farmers’ protest rally on Republic Day this year.Additional Sessions Judge Jagdish Kumar granted relief to Sidhana after noting that he has already joined the investigation and has been granted bail in a conspiracy case related to violence that ensued at the Red Fort here on January 26.Sidhana sought anticipatory bail in the case related to the clashes which took place between the farmers and police at Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar.The judge did not accept the submission of prosecution to deny him relief that even though he has joined the probe, one of the mobile phones handed over by him to the police is protected with a password and could not be opened as he refused to provide it. During the hearing, Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Madhukar Pandey submitted that Sidhana told the police that he has “forgotten” the password and is not co-operating in the investigation. “If, that is the situation how court can presume that he has forgotten the password or deliberately not disclosing the code for unlocking the mobile phone,” the judge said.The court further noted that Sidhana has admitted that he was part of the mob.The accused has been released on anticipatory bail on the condition that he has to join the probe as and when required and not influence the witnesses in any manner.The SPP opposed the bail plea and apprised the court that Sidhana was part of the unlawful assembly, attempted to “kill some police officials” and instigated the mob to break the barricades.The prosecutor added that the gangster even hugged some people to celebrate after breaking the barricades.He said that Sidhana is currently involved in 20 heinous cases including those related to murder and attempt to murder.Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, along with advocates Jaspreet Singh and Jasdeep Singh Dhillon, who represented Sidhana, told the court that their client is not even named in the FIR and police does not have an iota of evidence against him.Sidhana moved the court saying he had grave apprehension that he may be arrested as his first cousin Gurdeep Singh was abducted and tortured by the Delhi Police and was made to forcibly sign certain blank papers, the counsel said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/r-day-violence-court-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-gangster-activist-lakha-sidhana-312557

"In such a case, not even their parents can object to their relationship," the court further observed.Hearing a petition jointly filed by Shifa Hasan and her Hindu partner, a division bench comprising justice Manoj Kumar Gupta and Justice Deepak Verma said, "It cannot be disputed that two adults have the right of choice of their matrimonial partner, irrespective of the religion professed by them.""As the present petition is a joint petition by the two individuals who claim to be in love with each other and are major, therefore, in our considered opinion, nobody, not even their parents, can object to their relationship", the court added in a judgment  delivered on Thursday.In the joint petition, the petitioners' contention was that they are in love with each other and are living together on their own will. However, their relationship was not being accepted by some of their family members and they were disturbing their peaceful living.After hearing all sides at length, the court granted protection to the couple, saying that not even their parents could object to their relationship.Accordingly, the court directed the police authorities to ensure that the petitioners were not subjected to any harassment by the father of the girl or by any other person in connection with their relationship with each other.During the course of hearing, the petitioner, Shifa Hasan submitted before the court that she had also filed an application for conversion from Muslim to Hindu religion.According to her, on the said application, the district magistrate had called for a report from the police station concerned.As per the report, the boy's father was not agreeable to the marriage though his mother was ready for the same. Both parents of Hasan were opposed to the marriage.The court took note of the fact that both the petitioners are major, aged 19 and 24 years respectively.

Asian solidarity would depend on the example set by India-China relations,’’ the Minister said in his second meeting in three months with Wang to resolve the border issue.Jaishankar emphasised that the two sides should work towards early resolution of the border issues, because prolongation of the existing situation was negatively impacting the relationship.“The Ministers agreed that military and diplomatic officials should meet again and continue their discussions to resolve the remaining issues at the earliest,’’ said the Indian readout.The Chinese readout said Wang hoped India would meet China “halfway’’ to shift the situation in eastern Ladakh from “urgent dispute settlement’’ to regular management and control.China has always been positive in seeking a proper solution to the border issue and the recent meetings between military commanders and diplomats was “earnest and effective’’, it added.Significantly, Wang also said India and China should be opportunities of development to each other rather than threats. About $ 2 billion in potential Chinese FDI is stuck, including a $300 million takeover of the GM car plant in Maharashtra.The Chinese side extensively quoted Jaishankar, especially on his “clash of civilisations’’ observation as also that India is willing to work with China to comply with the agreements reached by both sides as also within BRICS and SCO.On the specifics of the border dispute, Jaishankar noted “some progress’’ in the resolution of the remaining border issues in Eastern Ladakh after the completion of disengagement in the Gogra area. However, some outstanding issues still needed to be resolved, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-asks-china-to-deal-with-india-on-merit-not-from-perspective-of-ties-with-other-nations-312500

May you continue to live a long and healthy life.”"As someone who cares deeply about this country, I congratulate you on the growing confidence you have brought about, despite challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic that has affected people around the globe. As the most populous democratic nation in the world, India's success benefits not only the people of India, but also contributes to the development of the world as a whole."I am convinced that the age-old Indian traditions of doing no harm -- ahimsa, backed by a compassionate motivation -- karuna, are not only relevant but are necessary in today's world. I also believe these principles can be readily  combined with modern education for the wider benefit of humanity."Whenever I have the occasion to do so, I regularly commend India for its robust democracy, its deeply rooted religious pluralism and for its remarkable harmony and stability."For us Tibetans living in exile, India is not only our spiritual refuge, but for more than 62 years has also been our physical home.

It includes the javelin thrown by Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra, which he had presented to the PM recently.

This means that this industry will have a turnover of approximately Rs 12,000-Rs 15,000 crore by then,” he added. Under the PLI scheme, the incentive for a manufacturer of drones and drone components will be 20 per cent of the value addition made by the company during the next three years and it would be calculated on the basis of annual sales revenue from drones and drone components (net of GST) minus the purchase cost (net of GST) of drone and drone components.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jyotiraditya-scindia-drone-industry-to-reach-rs-15-000-crore-turnover-by-2026-312215

17-09-2021||Vibha Sharma||New Ministry: 24 ministers take oath, none from Rupani govt inducted||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 16The ruling BJP today completely overhauled the Gujarat council of ministers, selecting all new faces for the Bhupendra Patel government.No Deputy CM in government Ahmedabad: There will be no deputy chief minister in the Bhupendra Patel-led BJP government in Gujarat, a post that existed in the previous Vijay Rupani-headed cabinet. The post was held by Nitin Patel during the Rupani government. PTI22 first-timers in councilSignificantly, none of the 24 ministers sworn-in today had served in the erstwhile Vijay Rupani government.The central leadership adopted a “no repeat” formula to beat anti-incumbency and other issues facing the party in the crucial 2022 elections in the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, perhaps also serving a message to leaders in other party-ruled states.The new ministers include 10 in the Cabinet rank and 14 Ministers of State. Together with CM Bhupendra Patel, there are now 22 (21 ministers) first-timers in the council. Prominent among those dropped is Patidar heavyweight and former Deputy CM Nitin Patel and Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, Education Minister in the Rupani government.Those inducted include former state BJP chief Jitubhai Vaghani and Assembly Speaker Rajendra Trivedi. Though majority are first-time legislators with only some with previous ministerial experience like Rajendra Trivedi, a minister in the Anandiben government, Kiritsinh Rana, who served under PM Modi, and Raghavji Patel, minister in Shankersinh Vaghela government.Politically significant Saurashtra and south Gujarat regions have landed maximum berths in the Cabinet formulated keeping in mind caste and regional balance. Present state chief CR Patil comes from south Gujarat and observers say his clout is evident in the choice of ministers.The transition was not as easy. Sources say marathon meetings were held to finalise the names. The ceremony, which was earlier scheduled on Wednesday, had to be postponed after upset sitting ministers, who were to be dropped, objected to the move.Apart from anti-incumbency, the ruling BJP is facing several other challenges (including from AAP), battling negative perceptions and allegations of Covid mismanagement in the state.The leadership which almost never replaced any CM (including Jharkhand where sentiments were clearly against incumbent CM Raghubar Das in 2019) changed as many as four in the past six months. What is even more surprising is the choice of replacements, mostly “second-rung leaders/back benchers in the state Assemblies” as some may in case of Bhupendra Patel and some of his ministers. A second-rung leader makes control easier for those sitting in Delhi instead of some well-entrenched politician with his or her own baggage, followers and adversaries, explain observers.The CM also allocated portfolios to 24 newly-inducted ministers, keeping a host of departments including Home with himself. Kanubhai Desai was allocated Finance and Energy and Petrochemicals portfolios.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-ministry-24-ministers-take-oath-none-from-rupani-govt-inducted-312224

Getting two doses of the Covid vaccine is a major priority.”“Several scientific rationale are now available to suggest that antibody levels should not be measured. You can have all kinds of immunity responses post vaccination - from cellular to mucosal immunity.

New Zealand, in keeping with its long-held policy, announced it would not allow nuclear-powered submarines to enter its waters. China, which will be at the receiving end of these endeavours, asked the trio to “shake off their Cold War mentality.” The announcement comes a day before the European Union (EU) published its Indo-Pacific strategy.The US, UK and Australia comprise a closely knit intelligence-sharing group that also includes New Zealand and Canada. The IAEA said it was engaging with these countries in the coming months on installing adequate safeguards. It is presumed that Australian Defence and Foreign Ministers may have hinted about the impending move during a recent meeting followed by phone calls with their Indian counterparts.

17-09-2021||New Delhi||Finance Minister: Bad bank to resolve Rs 2 lakh cr stressed loans||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday announced a Rs 30,600 crore government guarantee for National Asset Reconstruction Company Limited (NARCL) for acquiring stressed loan assets, paving the way for operationalisation of the bad bank.Security receiptsNARCL will pay up to 15 per cent of the agreed value for the loans in cash and the remaining 85 per cent will be government-guaranteed security receipts. — Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance MinisterThe decision to provide sovereign guarantee for security receipts (SRs) issued by the NARCL was taken at a meeting of the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday.The Finance Minister in Budget 2021-22 had announced setting up of a bad bank as part of resolution of bad loans worth about Rs 2 lakh crore.The bad bank or the NARCL will pay up to 15 per cent of the agreed value for the loans in cash and the remaining 85 per cent would be government-guaranteed security receipts. The government guarantee will be invoked if there is loss against the threshold value.“For the SRs to hold on and to have their value intact, there is a need for government to give the backstop arrangement and that’s why Rs 30,600 crore has been cleared by the Cabinet yesterday,” she said. This sovereign guarantee would be for a period of 5 years and the NARCL would have to pay a fee for this. “The SRs are getting the backstop through government funding only in as much as to pay the gap between the realised value (resolution/liquidation) and face value of the SRs and this will hold good for five years,” Sitharaman said.The fee for the guarantee will be initially 0.25 per cent, which will progressively increase to 0.5 per cent in case of delay in resolution of bad loans, Financial Services Secretary Debasish Panda said.This will enable speedy disposal of stressed assets and clean up balancesheets of banks for further lending, he explained.The Finance Minister further said public sector banks (PSBs) would hold 51 per cent stake in the NARCL and 49 per cent in the proposed debt management company — India Debt Resolution Company Ltd.There would be 16 shareholders for NARCL, including PSBs, private sector banks and NBFCs.The structure will assist in consolidation of debt, currently fragmented across various lenders, thus leading to faster, single point decision-making, she said.“It will incentivise quicker action on resolving stressed assets thereby helping in better value realisation. India Debt Resolution Company Limited (IDRCL) will engage market expertise for value enhancement. This approach will also permit freeing up of personnel in banks to focus on increasing business and credit growth,” she said.In the first phase, Panda said, banks have identified stress loans of about Rs 90,000 crore to be resolved.The NARCL is intended to resolve stressed loan assets above Rs 500 crore each amounting to about Rs 2 lakh crore. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/finance-minister-bad-bank-to-resolve-rs-2-lakh-cr-stressed-loans-312195

The newly appointed NCLAT chairperson Justice M Venugopal will be asked to go on leave until then, Attorney General KK Venugopal told a Bench led by CJI NV Ramana.Tenure controversyAs the controversy over Justice Cheema’s premature retirement as acting chairman of the NCLAT got blown over, the CJI thanked the Attorney General for solving the problem. The Bench, however, made it clear that “the instant order has been passed taking into consideration the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present facts and this shall not be treated as a precedent.” Justice Cheema had moved the top court against the government’s decision to curtail his tenure. He had demanded that at least he should be allowed to work up to September 20 as the officiating chairperson of the NCLAT to enable him to pronounce the judgments prepared by him.As the Attorney General said, “This will become awkward for the current chairperson,” the Bench shot back, “Your orders are also awkward. We have to say you are responsible for this situation.”Former Madras High Court judge Justice Venugopal had replaced Justice Cheema as an acting chairperson of the NCLAT on September 11.The top court had on Wednesday taken strong exception to the curtailment of Justice Cheema’s tenure.The Bench said it would suo motu stay the Tribunals Reforms Act, 2021, under which the decision was taken even as it asked the Attorney General to take instructions from the government on the issue.

17-09-2021||New Delhi||India expresses concern over activities by Khalistani separatist groups in US||Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the US next week, India on Thursday expressed concern over reports of growing anti-India activities by Pakistan-backed Khalistani separatist groups from American soil.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said ensuring the security of the prime minister and his delegation was an important issue when asked about reports that a banned Khalistani group is planning to hold protests in Washington and New York during Modi’s visit to the two cities.Referring to a report by leading American think-tank Hudson Institute about the Khalistani groups, he said it reflected how Pakistan was continuing efforts to undertake activities against India from the US.“I do not know about the specific call given by the banned outfit. I am not going to comment on that. But we certainly take a lot of interest in ensuring the security of the prime minister and his delegation,” Bagchi said at a media briefing.“We convey and share (this) with the host country, in this case, the US. If the organisation is banned, it should not be undertaking these kinds of activities,” he said.The external affairs ministry spokesperson said the issue is not about protest. “This issue is about security and these are organisations that have had problems in the past in terms of terrorist activities etc. I would not like to go into details,” he added.On the report by the Hudson Institute, Bagchi said it makes it clear how Pakistan has yet again continued its efforts in trying to undertake activities against India including terrorism. “It was very focused about activities they are taking in American soil. I do hope that authorities in the US will see that and understand the risks that this kind of activities pose for countries that have a shared vision against terrorism and violence,” Bagchi said.The think-tank said Pakistan-backed Khalistani separatist groups, banned by the Indian government, are quietly gaining ground in the US and that Washington has so far remained indifferent to the appeals made by New Delhi to curb their activities.The US-based Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a pro-Khalistan group, was banned by the Indian government in 2019 for its alleged anti-national activities.Modi will travel to the US next week to participate in the first in-person summit of the Quad that is expected to broadly focus on contemporary global challenges including the Afghan crisis, the coronavirus pandemic and ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. He will attend the Quad summit on September 24 in Washington and address the 76th session of the UN General Assembly in New York the next day.Bagchi said Modi will have a bilateral meeting with US President Joe Biden. “We are also looking forward to bilateral meetings with other Quad leaders,” he said.The MEA spokesperson said the prime minister is likely to have some other bilateral meetings with other leaders in New York.It will be the prime minister’s first visit to the US since President Joe Biden took office.The last time Modi visited the US was in September 2019 when he and then US President Donald Trump addressed the Howdy-Modi event in Houston.The US is hosting the in-person summit of the leaders of Quad to boost practical cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region as well as to send a strong signal about Washington’s commitment to the grouping.People familiar with the preparations for the summit said the situation in Afghanistan following the return of the Taliban to power will be deliberated extensively at the summit.Afghanistan has been grappling with increasing poverty and hunger besides witnessing widespread violations of human rights, particularly of the women under the new dispensation, triggering massive global concerns.The Quad leaders are expected to deliberate extensively on expanding cooperation in Indo-Pacific in the face of rising Chinese military muscle-flexing in the region, the people cited above said. Asked about the possibility of a meeting among foreign ministers of the SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) countries in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, Bagchi said there was no information on it yet.“There is no specific information whether it will take place this time or not. Nepal is the chair of SAARC and it has to convene it. If it is convened, I think we will participate,” he added. On multiple occasions, the foreign ministers of the SAARC met on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.The SAARC is a regional grouping comprising Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

With regard, though, to any specifics about over the horizon capabilities and the plans that we put in place and will continue to put in place, I’d rather take that up in a different setting.”Blinken was asked that considering rumours of ISI’s support for the Taliban, has the US administration reached out to India as a possible staging area for the over-the-horizon forces.The MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said at a media briefing, “We continue to be engaged with US and others regarding developments in Afghanistan. We won’t respond to media reports… actual conversation in the US Congress hearing was different from media reports.”Asked whether the three foundational military agreements signed with the US will oblige India to provide staging posts for strikes in Afghanistan, Bagchi said, “nobody can force us.

Faster and able to stay submerged longer than the diesel-powered versions, nuclear submarines are considered ideal for Taiwan Strait and South China Sea where China has the capability to engage all surface combatants.France reacted with dismay to the announcement as it meant cancellation of talks for a $ 90 billion submarine contract with Australia. New Zealand, in keeping with its long-held policy, announced that it would not allow nuclear-powered submarines to enter its waters. China, which will be at the receiving end of these endeavours, asked the trio to “shake off their Cold War mentality”.The announcement came a day before the European Union (EU) published its Indo-Pacific strategy.The three countries – US, UK and Australia – are “Five Eyes” countries, a very closely knit intelligence-sharing group that also includes New Zealand and Canada. The IAEA said it was engaging with these countries in the coming months on installing adequate safeguards.It is presumed that Australian Defence and Foreign Ministers may have hinted about the impending move during a recent meeting followed by phone calls with their Indian counterparts. Of the other two members of the Quad – Japan and India – the former has Constitutional constraints while the latter has a partnership with Russia.“Quad stands on its own,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.The trilateral is “part of a larger constellation of steps, including stronger bilateral partnerships with our traditional security partners in Asia – Japan, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines – and also stronger engagements with new partners like India, Vietnam and new formations like the Quad,” said a US official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-uk-australia-ink-new-military-pact-to-contain-china-312023

17-09-2021||Vibha Sharma||Complete overhaul in Gujarat Cabinet; none of 24 new ministers served in Rupani govt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 16Marking an unprecedented move, the ruling BJP on Thursday completely overhauled the Gujarat council of ministers, selecting all new faces for the Bhupendra Patel government.Significantly, none of 24 ministers sworn-in today had served in the erstwhile Vijay Rupani government.The central leadership adopted a “no repeat” formula to beat the anti-incumbency and other issues facing the party in the crucial 2022 elections in the home state of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, perhaps also serving a message to leaders in other party-ruled StatesThe new ministers include 10 in the Cabinet’ rank and 14 Ministers of State. Together with CM Bhupendra Patel, there are now 22 (21 ministers) first timers in the council. Prominent among those dropped is Patidar heavyweight and former deputy CM Nitin Patel and Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, the education minister in the Rupani government.Those inducted include former state BJP chief Jitubhai Vaghani and Assembly Speaker Rajendra Trivedi. Though majority are first-time legislators with only some with previous ministerial experience like Rajendra Trivedi, a minister in the Anandiben government and Kiritsinh Rana, who served under Narendra Modi.Raghavji Patel was minister in Shankersinh Vaghela government. Politically significant Saurashtra and south Gujarat regions have landed maximum berths in the Cabinet formulated keeping in mind caste and regional balance. Present state chief CR Patil comes from south Gujarat and observers say his clout is evident in the choice of ministers.The transition was not as easy. Sources say marathon meetings were held to finalise the names. The ceremony, which was earlier scheduled on Wednesday, had to be postponed after upset sitting ministers, who were to be dropped, objected to the move.Apart from anti-incumbency, the ruling BJP is facing several other challenges (including from AAP), battling negative perceptions and allegations of Covid-mismanagement in the state. Observers say through the overhaul of the state leadership by the central leadership appears a new formula to overcome the challengesIn any case, the leadership is clear that those who create “trouble by poking or continuously raising issues which eventually lead to the ouster of any CM should not be encouraged by giving them posts they have been vying for”, a signal perhaps for other states amid the buzz of “some more similar changes” in coming days.Observers say that what has happened in the BJP in the past six months is somewhat of a rarity in the party under PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. The leadership which almost never replaced any CM, including Jharkhand, where sentiments were clearly against incumbent CM Raghubar Das in 2019, changed as many as four in the past six months. What is even more surprising is the choice of replacements, mostly “second-rung leaders/back benchers in the state Assemblies” as some may in case of Bhupendra Patel and some of his ministers.A second-rung leader makes control easier for those sitting in Delhi instead of some well-entrenched politician with his or her own baggage, followers and adversaries, explain observers. Moreover, they fulfil basic requirements of the party in the run up to the elections, which in any case will be formulated and led by PM Modi and Shah.PM congratulates new ministers“Congratulations to all Party colleagues who have taken oath as Ministers in the Gujarat Government. These are outstanding Karyakartas who have devoted their lives to public service and spreading our Party’s development agenda. Best wishes for a fruitful tenure ahead,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.CABINET RANKJeetu Vaghani, (Bhavnagar West),Rajendra Trivedi (Raopur)Rushikesh Patel (Visnagar),Purnesh Modi (Surat)Raghavji Patel (Jamnagar rural) Kanubhai Desai (Pardi)Kiritsinh Rana (Limdi)Naresh Patel (Gandevi)Pradeep Parmar (Asarwa)Arjunsinh Chauhan (Mehamdavad)MoS (Independent charge)Harsh Sanghavi (Majora, Surat)Jagdish Panchal (Nikol)Manisha Vakil, (Vadodara city)Brajesh Merja (Morbi)Jitu Chaudhary (Kaparda)MINISTER OF STATE (MoS)Mukesh Patel  (Olpad)Arvind Rayani (Rajkot East)Kuber Dhindor (Santrampur)Kirtisinh Waghela (Kankrej)Nimisha Suthar (Morwa Hadaf)R C Makwana  (Mahua)Gajendrasingh Parmar (Prantij)Vinobhai Moradia (Katargam, Surat)Deva Malam (Keshod)Here are brief profiles of some of the ministers.Cabinet ministers:Rajendra Trivedi: He was nominated Speaker of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly in 2018 after serving as the Minister of State for Sports, Youth and Cultural Activities and Pilgrimage in the Rupani government.The 67-year lawyer won from the Raopura seat in Vadodara district for the second time in 2017.
