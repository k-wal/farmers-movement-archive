He will get in-person instructions but he does not want to appear in person. In fact, no senior advocate is willing to appear in physical hearing,” the bench observed.“It’s a far more efficient system,” Sibal said, adding that many young lawyers and women advocates are appearing and arguing their cases through video-conferencing mode.A handful of senior lawyers is getting benefited from this (virtual hearing) and many young lawyers have faced difficulties because of virtual hearing, Justice Saran said.SCBA has been demanding the re-opening of physical hearings in courts.

28-09-2021||New Delhi||Firecrackers: Can’t infringe others’ right to life in guise of employment, says SC||Maintaining that it needed to strike a proper balance between right to life and right to livelihood, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said it can’t infringe the right to life of other citizens “under the guise of employment of a few”.”We have to strike the balance between employment, unemployment and the right to life of the citizen. Under the guise of employment of few we cannot permit others to infringe the right to life of other citizens,” a Bench led by Justice MR Shah said while dealing with the issue of ban on firecrackers.”Our prime focus is the right to life of innocent citizens. If we find green crackers are there and accepted by the committee of experts we will pass suitable orders,” the bench said, adding that in our country, the main difficulty is implementation. Laws are there but ultimately implementation has to be there. Our order should be implemented in the true spirit,” it noted.The court had earlier refused to impose a complete ban on the sale of firecrackers and said sales can happen through only licensed traders and that only green crackers can be sold. The online sale of firecrackers has been completely banned.On behalf of the firecrackers manufacturers’ association, senior counsel Atmaram Nadkarni said in view of the upcoming Diwali on November 4, they wanted Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO) to take a decision on the issue.He said the government should decide the matter as lakhs of people were unemployed in the industry. The contempt must be heard and taken to its logical end but the plight of lakhs of people working in the firecracker industry should be taken into account, he added.On behalf of petitioner Arjun Gopal, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan said the court had directed that PESO will give final clearance to firecrackers that are safe.Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, representing the Ministry of Environment and Forests, said the ministry had in October 2020 filed an affidavit and if the Bench considered it, all the interim applications will be covered. Experts have suggested formulations on the issue of green crackers, she said.The court asked Sankaranarayanan to submit a separate compilation of orders and posted it for hearing on Wednesday.The Bench said every day there was a violation of orders and in every religious event, victory processions, marriages it could see flouting of its orders. “We will have to fix liability on someone, else this will not stop at all,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/firecrackers-cant-infringe-others-right-to-life-in-guise-of-employment-says-sc-317455

28-09-2021||---||After ‘White & Blue Revolutions’ India aims at ‘Honey Revolution'||New Delhi, September 28After ‘White Revolution’ and ‘Blue Revolution’ India is now aiming at ‘Honey Revolution’ with Agriculture Minister, Narendra Tomar today launching “single flower Amul honey passed under strict laboratory quality testing ” and 100 Farmer Producer Organisations of honey producers across the country to aggregate beekeepers and stakeholders.Speaking on the occasion Tomar said under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi the Centre has implemented several policy changes for strengthening the economic condition of the agriculture sector, especially small farmers.“With the arrival of ‘Amul honey’ in the market, the cooperative sector will be further strengthened.  Better marketing of honey will result in better honey prices to honey producing farmers.  Improvement in the quality and branding of honey will result in an increase in exports and increase the contribution of the agriculture sector to the foreign exchange reserves,” Tomar said.According to National Bee Board Executive Director Navin Patle, a honey testing laboratory has been set up in Gujarat for testing quality and other related works under the National Mission on Beekeeping and Honey. “Honey testing laboratories are also being established in Delhi and Bangalore. The quality of honey produced by FPOs being set up under the mission will all be assured through proper testing to ensure that consumers get quality product,” he said In order to identify and aggregate beekeepers and other stakeholders, 100 FPO clusters are being set across the country including in Punjab (Patiala, Ludhiana and Bathinda), Haryana (Hisar and Yamunanagar), Himachal Pradesh (Solan and Chamba) and J&K (Pulwama, Kupwara, Ramban and Baramulla), Patle said“The Centre has allocated Rs 500 crore for the National Beekeeping and Honey Mission for the current financial year (2020-2021) to the financial year 2022-2023,” he explained, adding that work is also being done on the possibilities of connecting beekeeping with dairy cooperatives and unions.“There is a huge scope in honey production given its immense health benefits. Honey production in India increased from 76,150 MT in 2013-14 to 1,25,000 MT in 2020-21 and export from 28378.42 MT in 2013-14 to 59,999 MT in 2020-21. NAFED has also developed 14 honey corners in its stores and this trend will continue,” he saidPatle says the groundwork for FPO formation should be complete within six months. “Implementing agencies NAFED NDDB and TRIFED, which will do paperwork, handholding etc, have been given the target to identify and aggregate beekeepers and stakeholders. Beekeepers will have the choice of flower/plant they want to use for making honey,” Patle added.Meanwhile, the Centre has established Madhukranti Portal for online registration to achieve the traceability source of honey as well as other beehive products on the digital platform and help in checking the quality and the source of adulteration of honey. As role models for beekeeping 16 Integrated Beekeeping Development Centers have been started in different states, officials said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-white-blue-revolutions-india-aims-at-honey-revolution-317445

28-09-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC grants bail to person accused of speeding away with constable on car bonnet||The Delhi High Court has granted bail to a person accused of hitting a police constable with his car and speeding away with him on the bonnet, saying that the investigation in the case is almost complete and he would not be able to influence the police witnesses.  Justice Subramonium Prasad said that no useful purpose would be served by keeping the accused, an engineering graduate, in further custody and directed that he be released on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs 75,000 with two sureties of the like amount.“A perusal of the site map shows that the petitioner hit the victim and drove a considerable distance before stopping the vehicle as another car came in front of him from the other side. The site map shows that the petitioner was not driving on the straight road but took at least four turns before stopping the vehicle.“Be that as it may, the investigation is more or less complete. Most of the witnesses are police witnesses and their statements have been recorded. The charge sheet will be filed on or before 10.10.2021,” the judge said in his order dated September 27.The court added that the “Supreme Court has laid down a number of times that a man is innocent until he is found guilty and bail is rule while jail is an exception” and therefore, the accused cannot be kept behind bars only on account of being accused of committing an offence of attempt to murder. “No doubt the petitioner is charged with an offence under Section 307 IPC and if convicted, the petitioner may be sentenced for life, but that alone cannot be a factum to keep the petitioner in incarceration,” the order said.    “The petitioner is an engineering graduate having roots in the society. In view of the above, this court is of the opinion that no useful purpose would be served in keeping the petitioner in custody,” it added.The judge directed the accused to not leave the city without the court’s permission or tamper with evidence and try to influence the witnesses.The accused shall also report to the concerned police station twice a week, give all his mobile numbers to the investigating officer and keep them operational at all times, the court said.As per the FIR, the complainant, a head constable, along with two others, was carrying out routine checking on a road on June 22 this year when the accused refused to stop his white car, having tinted glasses, in spite of being signalled to do so.The complainant claimed that he tried to stop the car from the front and he jumped on the bonnet of the car but the accused did not stop the car.It was stated that the complainant held on to the car wipers and fell on the road when the accused applied brakes on account of another car came from the opposite side.The accused surrendered in July 2021 and sought his release on the ground that since the investigation was over, no useless purpose would be served in keeping him in custody.The prosecution opposed the release of the accused in view of the gravity of the offence. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-hc-grants-bail-to-person-accused-of-speeding-away-with-constable-on-car-bonnet-317437
28-09-2021||Rajim (Chhattisgarh)||Country will see ‘company raaj’ as public assets being put on sale: Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Tuesday alleged the country’s entire assets are put on sale and it would see a “company raaj” (corporate rule) in the coming days as he slammed various policies of the Centre.He said the capital of every State would witness protests for the repeal of three Central farm laws if the demands of cultivators are not accepted by the government.Addressing a Kisan Mahapanchayat in Rajim town of Chhattisgarh, Tikait appealed to youths to join farmers in their protest “to save land, crops and the generation”.The event was attended by thousands of farmers, many of them from Punjab and Haryana, which was held under the aegis of the Chhattisgarh Kisan Majdoor Mahasangh, an umbrella organisation of farmer unions.“The day is not far when farmers will have to leave the sickle (a farm tool) and resort to revolution. We have to fight against the three agriculture laws,” Tikait said.Referring to the 10-month-old protests at the borders of Delhi for the repeal of three Central farm laws, Tikait said that the capital of every State would witness similar protests if the demands of cultivators are not accepted by the government.Farmers should get the minimum support price (MSP) for every agricultural produce including vegetables, and also for milk, he said.“Till the time the Centre withdraws the three laws, farmers should not back down. You have to support the protest. If the Delhi protest fails, no such agitation will be held in future,” he said.Hitting out at the Centre, the farmer leader said, “railways, airports, ports, LIC are being sold (to private players). The entire assets of the country are put on sale. They have come to loot the nation. They want everything to go into the hands of the private sector. The country will see a company raaj”.He said farmers are being targeted now but the next target will be the media.“They are trying to divide the country into castes and religions but you should not focus on their propaganda and should know only one thing that we all belong to only one community that is the farmer,” Tikait said.Calling upon young people to join the protest, he said youths will have to take the movement to the masses through social media.“The country needs revolution by youths. This movement will have to be carried forward through Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other online platforms by youths,” he added.Yogendra Yadav, Medha Patkar and other leaders of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) also addressed the gathering.On Monday, the SKM observed Bharat Bandh to mark one year since President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the three controversial laws and 10 months since thousands of farmers set up camp at Delhi’s border points to voice their protest.The three laws—The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- were passed by Parliament in September last year.The Centre has projected them as major reforms, but the unions allege that the laws will leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates. Farmers have been protesting against the three laws on Delhi’s borders since November last year.

28-09-2021||New Delhi||Centre extends nationwide Covid-19 containment measures till October 31||The Centre on Tuesday extended the nationwide COVID-19 containment measures till October 31 in view of localised spreads of the virus in a few states and the disease continuing to be a public health challenge in the country.In a communication to chief secretaries of all states and union territories, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla also cautioned against the possibility of Covid-appropriate behaviour not being adhered to strictly during the upcoming festival which may lead to a surge in cases again.Despite a decline in Covid-19 cases, it is critical to enforce guidelines that allow regular festivities in a cautious, safe and Covid-appropriate manner, he asserted.He said the daily Covid-19 cases and the overall number of Covid-19 patients in the country are decreasing steadily but there are still localised spreads of virus in a few states and Covid-19 continues to be a public health challenge in the country.“Utmost vigil has to be maintained in respect of mass gathering events, so as to avoid any possibility of a surge in Covid-19 cases.“Consequently, large scale gatherings in fairs, festivals; and religious events and functions may lead to afresh surge in Covid-19 cases in the country,” the communication said.The home secretary said states and UTs, on a regular basis, should closely monitor case positivity, hospital, ICU beds occupancy of every district falling under their jurisdiction.“The state governments and UT administrations concerned, having high positivity in their districts, should take proactive containment measures so as to effectively arrest the spike in cases and to contain the spread of transmission,” he said.Bhalla said it is important to identify warning signs of potential surges early on and to take appropriate measures to curb the spread.“This would require a localised approach, as has been mentioned in Ministry of Health and Family Welfare advisory dated September 21, 2021,” he said.The home secretary said there should be a continued focus on the five-fold strategy i.e. Test-Track-Treat-Vaccination and adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour, to safely navigate through the festive season and avoid the possibility of a surge in Covid-19 cases.He said the state governments and UT administrations should continue with their vaccination programme with a focus to accelerate vaccination of eligible age groups and prioritisation of the second dose to eligible beneficiaries.The home secretary urged the chief secretaries to issue directions to the district and all other local authorities concerned to take necessary measures as advised in the union health ministry advisory for prompt and effective management of Covid-19.“I would also advise that orders issued by the respective state governments and UT administrations or district authorities in this regard should be widely disseminated to the public and to the field functionaries for their proper implementation,” he said.The number of fresh coronavirus cases was recorded at below 20,000 (18,795) in India after 201 days on Tuesday, taking the country’s Covid-19 tally to 3,36,97,581, while the number of active cases declined to 2,92,206, the lowest in 192 days, according to the Union health ministry.A total of 18,795 fresh Covid-19 cases were registered in a span of 24 hours, while the death toll due to the viral disease climbed to 4,47,373 with 179 more fatalities, the lowest in 193 days, according to the ministry’s data updated at 8 am.

28-09-2021||New Delhi||Post-poll violence: SC notice on West Bengal govt's plea against Calcutta High Court order for CBI probe||The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notice on the West Bengal government's petition challenging the Calcutta High Court's order for a CBI probe into post-poll cases of murder and rape, allegedly committed by TMC supporters.Asking the original petitioners before the high court and the CBI to file their replies to the West Bengal government's petition, a Bench led by Justice Vineet Saran posted the matter for October 7."On the face of it, you have made out a case for issuance of notice. Let's see. We will give a short time for respondents to file counter," the Bench told senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who represented the TMC government.As Sibal requested the Bench to stay future filing of FIRs by CBI, Justice Saran said, "We don't have to do it. It's a matter of only a week...nothing will happen."Sibal said the CBI was issuing notices to police officers in various cases.The top court said it would not like to pass any orders without hearing the other side.During the hearing, Sibal said the High Court violated the principles of natural justice of the state government in transferring post-poll violence cases to the CBI as only seven days were given to state police to probe thousands of complaints and whatever was said by state wasn't considered by the HC.The West Bengal government had on September 1 moved the top court against the Calcutta High Court's order for a CBI probe into the incidents of murder and rape, allegedly committed by TMC supporters targeting BJP workers after the assembly election results were declared on May 2.Accusing the CBI of acting at the behest of the Centre, the Mamata Banerjee government had contended that it could not expect a fair probe by the central agency which had been foisting cases upon TMC leaders.It had alleged that there were several discrepancies in the NHRC report that formed the basis of the Calcutta High Court’s August 19 order for a CBI probe.Immediately after the HC order, the CBI had formed four special teams and it has registered 31 cases of rape and murder so far in connection with the post-poll violence that claimed several lives in West Bengal and forced thousands to flee the state.CBI files chargesThe CBI has filed a charge sheet against six people, said to be TMC workers, in connection with the killing of a man during post-poll violence at Sitalkuchi in West Bengal’s Cooch Behar district, officials said on Tuesday.The findings of the probe agency are in contrast to the allegations levelled in the FIR. The wife of the deceased had claimed that her family was a Trinamool Congress supporter and her husband was shot dead by “BJP goons”.The CBI has filed the charge sheet against Tahidul Mia, Haridas Barman, Madan Barman, Naba Kumar Barman, Shyamal Barman and Arabindo Barman in the court of  Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Cooch Behar, officials said.The Calcutta High Court last month directed the CBI to probe the post-poll violence cases.— With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-poll-violence-sc-notice-on-west-bengal-govts-plea-against-calcutta-high-court-order-for-cbi-probe-317413
28-09-2021||Washington||Pakistan home to 12 foreign terrorist outfits: US Congressional report||Pakistan is home to at least 12 groups designated as 'foreign terrorist organisations' by the US, including five of them being India-centric like the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), according to the latest Congressional report on terrorism.US officials have identified Pakistan as a base of operations or target for numerous armed and non-state militant groups, some of which have existed since the 1980s, the independent Congressional Research Service (CRS) said in the report.The report, 'Terrorist and Other Militant Groups in Pakistan', released by the bipartisan research wing of US Congress on the eve of the historic Quad summit hosted by US President Joe Biden at the White House last week, said that these groups operating in Pakistan can be broadly categorised into five types -- globally-oriented, Afghanistan-oriented, India- and Kashmir-oriented, domestically oriented, and Sectarian (anti-Shia).The Lashkar-e-Taiba (LET) was formed in the late 1980s in Pakistan and designated as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) in 2001.“LET was responsible for major 2008 attacks in Mumbai, as well as numerous other high-profile attacks,” the CRS said.Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM) was founded in 2000 by Kashmiri militant leader Masood Azhar and was designated as an FTO in 2001. Along with LET, it was responsible for the 2001 attack on the Indian parliament, among other attacks, it said.JEM also has openly declared war on the United States, it noted.Harakat-ul Jihad Islami (HUJI) was formed in 1980 in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet army and was designated as an FTO in 2010. After 1989, it redirected its efforts towards India, although it did supply fighters to the Afghan Taliban.“With an unknown strength, HUJI today operates in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India, and seeks annexation of Kashmir into Pakistan,” the report said, adding that HUM was designated as an FTO in 1997 and operates mainly from Pak-Occupied Kashmir and from some Pakistani cities.Finally, Hizb-ul Mujahideen (HM) was formed in 1989—reportedly as the militant wing of Pakistan's largest Islamist political party—and designated as an FTO in 2017. It is one of the largest and oldest militant groups operating in Jammu and Kashmir.Among other terrorist groups operating from Pakistan are Al Qaeda, CRS said, adding that it has operated primarily from the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas and in the megacity of Karachi, as well as in Afghanistan. It has since 2011 been led by Ayman al-Zawahiri and reportedly maintains supportive ties with many of the groups inside the country.CRS said according to the US State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2019, Pakistan has “continued to serve as a safe haven for certain regionally focused terrorist groups,” and has “allowed groups targeting Afghanistan...as well as groups targeting India...to operate from its territory”.Pakistan’s neighbours, including Afghanistan and India, and the US have long accused Islamabad of providing safe haven and support to militants.

This is his first visit since he resigned as CM.Although right after arrival, Capt said he was in Delhi for a personal visit and to vacate Kapurthala House for the new chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi, the political circles remained abuzz with what the days ahead might hold, with Punjab staring at a crisis following the resignation of state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and at least one minister loyal to him Razia Sultana.Navjot Singh Sidhu resigns as Punjab Congress chiefAsked if Capt would meet BJP top brass, including home minister Amit Shah, sources close to Capt said there was no confirmation of any meeting yet.“There are likely to be a host of engagements in Delhi,” a source sufficed to say.Singh after resigning as Punjab CM has said he would “sacrifice anything to keep PCC chief Navjot Sidhu from becoming CM terming Sidhu dangerous for the country and Punjab”.Punjab CM Channi defends A-G’s appointment, says every lawyer takes up different cases professionallyIt was coincidental that Sidhu resigned as PCC chief on the same day as Capt arrived in Delhi.Although it is being speculated that Capt may meet Shah and BJP chief JP Nadda, there’s no official word on any meeting with the suspense still lingering.Capt is also likely to meet some senior Congress leaders in Delhi, including G23 group members.The visit is being keenly watched in Punjab and nationally.BJP sources said there was no meeting planned with Shah as yet but did not completely rule out the possibility of an engagement between the two leaders.Too much being read into @capt_amarinder’s visit to Delhi. He’s on a personal visit, during which he’ll meet some friends and also vacate Kapurthala house for the new CM. No need for any unnecessary speculation. pic.twitter.com/CFVCrvBQ0i||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/capt-amarinder-lands-in-delhi-all-eyes-on-who-he-meets-317402

This includes the areas that are under the illegal occupation of Pakistan. We call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation.”Pakistan, too, had then exercised its Right of Reply to the remarks made by Dubey.Khan and other Pakistani leaders and diplomats have consistently raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and other internal matters of India in their addresses to the UN General Assembly and other forums of the world organisation.

He added that it was one of the reasons behind the mysterious fever, which had hit the western UP districts of Firozabad, Agra, Mathura and Aligarh that led to the deaths of many people last month.Speaking to IANS, Dr BL Sherwal, RGSS Hospital Director, said that irrespective of the Dengue strain, the precaution is same as the same mosquito spreads the disease. He said that the most important precaution is not to let water stagnate around you and use full sleeve dress. He warned that this type of mosquito generally bites in the day time, so we need to take extra care of it. Dr Sherwal added that these are just types of dengue with more or less same symptoms and same pattern of prevention too.Dr Vineeta Singh Tandon of PSRI Hospital said that D2 is more virulent and can cause high grade fever, vomiting, joint pains, altered sensorium and may even lead to lethal complications resulting in dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome.If a person was infected by one sero type in the past, a second infection by another sero type increases the risk of causing dengue hemorrhagic fever. Rest, hydration and managing fever with paracetamol is advisable. One should avoid taking analgesics and aspirin.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dengue-patients-should-avoid-taking-analgesics-aspirin-say-experts-317375

While the aviation regulator already examines aviation personnel by breath analysers to check alcohol content in their bodies before commencing flight duties, a senior official said the latest move was to ensure the safety of passengers and aircraft.“The worldwide spread of use of psychoactive substances, their general availability and the ever-increasing number of addicted users is a serious concern to aviation safety. Their use causes behavioural, cognitive and physiological changes. This manifests in dependence, major health related issues and negative effect on performance,” said the DGCA in the civil aviation requirement (CAR) order dated September 27, 2021.“The organisations must ensure that all employees have an equal chance of being tested each time the selection is made. Specific individuals or groups must not be targeted, including certain locations,” said a senior official. “All positive cases needed to be reported to the DGCA within 24 hours.

A suspected TMC supporter could be seen grabbing a securityman by the collar, who swiftly pulled out a pistol to scare away the crowd.The incident occurred when Ghosh had gone inside a vaccination camp in Jodubabur Bazaar area in the constituency, where bypoll will be held on September 30. TMC supporters present at the spot raised slogans demanding that he leave, alleging that he was campaigning at a state-run vaccination programme which was not permitted.Ghosh, who was whisked away by his security guards, later alleged TMC supporters “attacked” him without provocation and injured a BJP activist.Ghosh, who was recently removed as the state BJP chief and appointed the party’s national vice president, later addressed a press conference where he demanded postponement of the bypoll in Bhabanipur. The BJP lashed out at the TMC accusing that its workers have been carrying out “state-sponsored” violence.BJP chief spokesperson Anil Baluni said the conduct of the TMC since the party’s third straight win in the assembly polls recently has “ashamed” democracy. — TNS & PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-dilip-ghosh-heckled-as-west-bengal-bypoll-campaign-din-ends-317035

The former AICC general secretary, who represents Navelim in the Goa Assembly, today tendered his resignation as a Congress MLA.The Congress strength in the Goa Assembly is down to four now even though the party had won 17 seats in the last elections. Before resigning, Faleiro heaped praises on TMC chief Mamata Banerjee saying the country needed a “leader like her to fight the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi”.Faleiro said he had nothing against Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. For the Congress, the resignation of Faleiro is a huge embarrassment considering Sonia had named him party’s campaign committee chief for Goa recently. Goa elections are due in 2022.Faleiro is the second senior Congress leader to quit the party for the TMC in recent days. Former Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev had also left for the TMC.In Kerala, Sudheeran, former MP and former Kerala Pradesh Congress chief, is learnt to have resigned from the AICC despite attempts by Congress general secretary Tariq Anwar to placate him.Sudheeran, sources say, is miffed with “unilateral decision making in the state unit” and “disregard of the opinion of district unit chiefs”. Sudheeran had two days ago quit the political affairs committee of the Congress’ Kerala unit.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi is a Lok Sabha MP from Kerala’s Wayanad.The two developments signal growing troubles for the Congress as Rahul and his sister Priyanka Vadra emerge stronger and call the shots across states.In a veiled jibe at the current leadership wherein Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra are taking decisions, Faleiro said , “This is not the same Congress we fought and sacrificed for.”No hope for Cong: Faleiro to SoniaFaleiro in his resignation letter to Sonia Gandhi said there was absolutely no hope for the Congress or even a will to prevent the collapse of the party.

The initiative would facilitate maintenance of patients’ record in digital format for easy access by doctors. It would also bring hospitals, doctors, pharmacies and laboratories on a single online platform for citizens to choose from.Terming the mission’s launch as historic and “an unprecedented phase in health reforms in India”, the PM said it had the potential to revolutionise healthcare delivery with huge benefits for the poor and middle classes who postpone treatments due to varied difficulties. “The mission will make hospital access easy. At present, the digital solution of one hospital is restricted to that hospital only. Patients have to repeat tests and registrations every time they seek fresh consultation elsewhere. They have to move around with old medical files. This wastes time of patients and doctors and causes avoidable expenditure. Absence of medical history can also lead to contradictory treatment. The mission solves this,” the PM said.He said health records of citizens would be digitally protected and patients and doctors could access these whenever they want. “Doctors, nurses and paramedics will be registered on the digital platform along with labs and pharmacies. All stakeholders will be brought on one platform,” he said while launching the project successfully tested in six UTs, including Chandigarh.The mission will have a database for people to choose specialists in their vicinity and preferred languages.“Labs and pharmacy identification will become easy. Treatment and healthcare policy systems will become more effective since doctors and hospitals can use the mission for remote counselling,” the PM said. — TNSThe initiative||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/digital-health-ids-for-all-medical-files-to-be-pass%C3%A9-317041

Women employees were largely employed in traditional sectors of education (43.9%) followed by heath (39.9%).Across all nine sectors covered, male workforce outnumbered female workforce, indicating consistently low female participation in India’s organised job space.Estimated self-employed female workers (0.2%) were mainly reported (0.4%) in trade, accommodation and restaurants sectors, followed by financial services sector (0.3%).Share of women in the workforce across the nine selected sectors has declined over the past eight years.

They are lagging behindNoting that cases of the weaker sections and criminal matters were taking a backstage, the CJI said, “We have to wait. We are streamlining the (mentioning) system and here corporations want their matters to be listed first.”Referring to pending criminal appeals, family disputes and cases of poor people, the CJI said, “There are pending criminal appeals, bail matters and other cases of people from weaker sections. They are lagging behind.” After taking over as the CJI in April, Justice Ramana had discontinued the practice of allowing direct mentioning of cases for urgent listing before the Benches and has instead asked the lawyers to mention their cases before the designated official.Instead, he had started a new system of mentioning cases for urgent hearings before top court officials instead of directly before Benches to ensure that senior lawyers were not given “special priority”. “We do not want to give any special priority to the senior lawyers and deprive the junior lawyers of opportunities. So this system was made, where all can make the mention before the mentioning Registrar”, he had said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-questions-priority-listing-for-corporate-matters-317043

Regular deliberations were being held by local administrations with farmers’ organisations from time to time to convince them to remove the blockade as the general public was facing great hardship due to such blockades, it added.Giving details of its efforts, the Haryana Government said a state-level committee headed by the Additional Chief Secretary was formed to find a way out. The committee’s September 19 meeting wasn’t attended by the farmers’ leaders. However, industrialists from Sonipat, hit by the blockade, turned up for the meeting on their volition and narrated the “myriad difficulties” faced by them due to the blockade since November last year.Earlier, the UP Government had also submitted in an affidavit that it was making all efforts to convince farmers that their act of blocking roads was causing grave inconvenience to commuters.While hearing a petition filed by Monicca Agarwal of Noida, a Bench led by Justice SK Kaul had on August 23 asked the Centre and governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to find a solution to the blockade of roads. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trying-to-convince-farm-unions-to-lift-blockade-haryana-to-supreme-court-317044

The support to the bandh has proved it is a pan-India protest.The 6 am to 4 pm Bharat Bandh, which saw demonstrations and rallies at many places, passed off relatively peacefully with no reports of injuries or serious clashes. The impact was felt the most around Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, the centre of farm protests, and also in pockets of Kerala, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha.Protesters blocked highways and arterial roads and squatted on tracks at several places from morning as the shutdown called by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 40 farmer unions, got underway to mark Presidential assent to the three laws.Charanjit Singh Channi, Punjab Chief MinisterWith farmers: CMI stand with farmers & appeal to the Union Govt to repeal the three anti-farmer laws. The SKM claimed in a statement that its call for a shutdown had received an “unprecedented and historic” response in more than 23 states. Looking ahead, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said at an online discussion that a solution could only be reached through dialogue and not in the courts.Though life in large parts of India was unhindered by the shutdown, North India felt the pinch with about 50 trains being affected and massive jams that prevented the cross-border movement of commuters as well as trucks carrying essentials.The Delhi-NCR region, including the satellite towns of Gurgaon, Ghaziabad and Noida, where thousands cross the borders each day was particularly hit. Even as business activity remained largely unaffected, the Capital witnessed large-scale traffic jams in several parts of the city and border areas adjoining Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.With heavy security deployed to avoid any untoward incident, the Delhi Police carried out security checks at its border points, causing the traffic to slow down. The roads around the historic Red Fort as well as the dual carriageway at Ghazipur border were closed to traffic. The police, however, kept giving updates to commuters about road closures and traffic snarls on Twitter. A senior police officer said no protester was allowed to enter Delhi from the three protest sites (Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur).The Uttar Pradesh Police had closed the national highway connecting Ghaziabad and Nizamuddin in Delhi.

They are reacting to our response. We have forced PLA to go for forward deployment and boost infrastructure,” said one of the people.They said the new deployments are appearing to be affecting the morale of the Chinese troops as they were not used to operate in such difficult terrain.The new container-based accommodations were built in addition to the additional military camps that the Chinese military had set up following the escalation in tension between the two sides last year.The people said India is also ramping up construction of tunnels, bridges roads and other critical infrastructure in eastern Ladakh and other areas along the nearly 3,500-km LAC.They said China is also significantly enhancing its airbases and air defence units near the LAC in eastern Ladakh.The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong lake area and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.The border row escalated after the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15 last year.Twenty Indian Army personnel laid down their lives in the clashes that marked the most serious military conflicts between the two sides in decades.In February, China officially acknowledged that five Chinese military officers and soldiers were killed in the clashes with the Indian Army though it is widely believed that the death toll was higher.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in Gogra area last month.In February, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in line with an agreement on disengagement.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC in the sensitive sector.

Hold the meeting and put your house in order. We will not allow the lives of these young doctors to be placed in the hands of some insensitive bureaucrats,” it added.The top court was hearing a plea of 41 Post Graduate doctors who have challenged the last-minute changes made to the syllabus after the notification for examination was issued.At the outset, senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the young doctors, said there is urgency in the matter and they have filed a written submission also in the matter.Advocate Gaurav Sharma, appearing for NMC, said that they would like to file reply in the matter and sought adjournment of one week.The bench said, “Mr Sharma, what is the NMC doing? We are dealing with the lives of young doctors who will pursue super speciality courses. You have issued the notification for examination on July 23 and then changed the syllabus on August 31. What is this? They are to sit for examinations on November 13 and 14.”Senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for NBE, said they be given time to file the reply till next Monday, as there were suitable reasons for doing the changes and authorities were well aware of the difficulties of the students and was after approvals of the three authorities concerned.The bench said, “Then why the notification for examination was issued Mr Singh? Why cannot it happen next year? You see, students start preparing for these critical medicine courses months and months in advance. What was the need for last minute change?” Singh said change in syllabus was in the offing for quite some time and preparation was on since 2018 and the authorities concerned have tried to take care of the difficulties.“Kindly give us one week, we will explain everything,” he said.The bench told the senior counsel, “We are ready to hear you but tell the authorities that we are unsatisfied with the way the last minute changes were made. We are putting you on notice in advance that if we don’t agree with your justification, we will pass structures and we will deal with you.”It said, “Just because someone has the authority to wield power does not mean that he can wield power without application of mind. When you yourself issued notification for examination in July, then what was the need to rock the boat in August. Please talk to MoHFW and NMC and put your house in order.”Justice Chandrachud said this examination is very important for their (doctors) career and merely because these doctors have already passed the MBBS exams doesn’t mean that they can change the exam pattern last minute.“You have to deal with these young doctors with sensitivity,” he said.Justice Nagarathna said, “Pattern of study for these young doctors will depend on the pattern of questions. If you make last minute changes, they will be ruffled.”She said the young doctors might be put at ruse due to the last minute changes.Justice Chandrachud said he agrees with his sister judge and added “We have an example of Common Law Admission Test (CLAT). I have heard that students need to study for two years to prepare for the exams. Here it takes months and months for these doctors who have to study critical medicines and to prepare for the examination and you cannot just make last minute changes.”Singh said the court should hear the arguments first and then form any opinion in the matter.The bench said it is open to the arguments but if it does not accept the submissions then the authorities concerned should also be ready to accept the strictures passed by the court.“These people who are doctors at NMC board have passed the stage which the young doctors are in at present but it does not mean that they will treat them like this. You better come up with strong reasons. List on Monday,” it said.The plea has said as per the prevailing pattern of examination, 60 per cent marks are given on questions from super speciality courses while 40 per cent of the marks are given from other courses.As per the notification issued on August 31 for modifying the pattern of examination, 100 per cent marks will be now given on questions from general medicine.The young doctors have said in their plea that they have been preparing for the examination as per the earlier pattern which has been in existence for the last three years.

28-09-2021||Beijing||China defends visa curbs against stranded Indians, says it’s ‘appropriate’ to combat Covid-19||China on Monday defended its visa curbs which have prevented thousands of stranded Indians from returning to Beijing, saying they are “appropriate” to control the spread of Covid-19 and do not target India alone, but are applied to even Chinese citizens coming back from overseas.Responding to questions on Indian ambassador to Beijing Vikram Misri’s criticism of China’s prolonged stringent travel restrictions, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying also ruled out the easing of the curbs in the near future.Misri, in his address to the Track-II Dialogue on China-India Relations last week, expressed “disappointment” over China’s reluctance to permit the return of thousands of stranded Indian students, employees and their families due to the COVID-19 pandemic.He described China’s restrictions as an “unscientific approach” to a purely humanitarian issue.Asked for her reaction, Hua told a media briefing here that the measures were taken for the safety and wellbeing of the people.“China’s measures are appropriate and also I would like to say that China applies quarantine measures to all inbound travellers. China is willing to have good arrangements on the bilateral travel of personnel,” she said.Hua also said the travel curbs are applied to Chinese citizens returning from abroad.According to reports, a large number of Chinese nationals stranded in India were not able to return due to stringent travel restrictions and suspension of flights.“China has to make a lot of quarantine measures but they are not targeting India alone. It is applied equally to everyone including Chinese citizens coming back to China,” Hua said.Besides over 23,000 Indian students studying in Chinese colleges, mostly medicine, hundreds of businessmen, employees, and their families have been stuck in India since last year.The curbs also resulted in several people either losing jobs, businesses, or separation of families.“While ensuring safety we are ready to work with countries including India by making proper arrangements. But I don’t mean to say that we will immediately solve the issue,” Hua said when asked whether China will discuss the resumption of travel with India.“Our measures are appropriate and we will make the necessary adjustments in accordance with the evolving situation,” she said.Hua also said China is adopting the Covid-19 protocols in a scientific manner.“Since the onset of Covid-19, China has been adopting quarantine measures in a scientific manner based on law,” she said.“The pandemic is still spreading globally. So, the Chinese government has taken a lot of measures and we are also adjusting the measures in accordance with the evolving situation to protect the safety and health of the relevant personnel,” she said.In his address ambassador Misri had said, “Far less complex issues, which have a purely humanitarian context and are not connected to bilateral diplomatic stances, such as facilitating the movement of students, businesspersons and stranded family members from India to China for over a year and a half now, await a more balanced and sensitive approach.”“I might add here that India has also attempted to keep our trade and commercial relationship insulated from current differences, for instance by continuing to issue visas to Chinese businesspersons to visit India,” he said.However, we are disappointed to see an unscientific approach with regard to several problems currently being faced by Indian students, businessmen, marine crew and exporters, to name a few,” the ambassador said.Meanwhile, according to the Indian embassy in Beijing, several students on Monday demonstrated in front of the Chinese embassy in New Delhi protesting against the visa curbs which effectively prevented them from returning to re-join their studies in the country.

28-09-2021||Aditi Tandon||Health ID for every citizen: PM Modi launches Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, Sept 27Decks were cleared on Monday for the generation of digital health IDs of Indians, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi launching the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission which entails maintenance of patient records in digital format for easy access by doctors, apart from bringing all health stakeholders on a single platform for citizens to choose from.Terming the Mission’s launch as “an unprecedented phase of health reforms in India”, the PM said the mission has the potential to revolutionise healthcare delivery in India with greater benefits for the poor and middle classes.“The Digital Mission will improve the ease of living and make access of hospitals easy. Currently, digital solution of one hospital is restricted to that hospital only. Patients have to repeat their registrations and tests every time they seek fresh consultation with a different hospital. He has to move around with old files. This wastes time of patients and doctors, and leads to woes and increased expenditure.People often lose their medical records. Absence of medical history often leads to waste of time, contradictory treatments and troubles. The mission solves all of this,” the PM said, noting that the launch was part of the ongoing seven-year exercise to ease healthcare delivery for Indians.The mission, PM said, will specially help villagers, and will provide all the important information on doctors and their availability across India.“The mission will link digital health solutions of all hospitals and give citizens a digital health ID. Every citizen’s health record will be digitallly protected. Patients and doctors can check previous records when they want. Doctors, nurses and paramedics will also be registered on the digital platform so also labs and pharmacies. The mission will bring all health stakeholders on one platform,” the PM said.The mission was successfully tested through a yearlong pilot in six UTs, including Chandigarh.The PM said with the digital health mission the patient can access services of a doctor who knows his language and has the specialty to treat his condition.“Labs and pharmacy identification will also become easy. The treatment and healthcare policy system will become more effective with this Mission since doctors and hospitals can use it for remote counselling. This will improve treatment and save money,” the PM said, adding that the government was working to change the old approach to health by promoting a new model of preventive care and affordable and accessible healthcare.Listing other initiatives, the Prime Minister said work was under way to set up one medical college after every three Lok Sabha seats and 80,000 primary health centres were operational near homes to detect serious diseases in time.“Medical infrastructure construction is being enhanced. Critical care blocks are being created in districts hospitals along with paediatric care facilities. Oxygen plants at district hospital level are coming up. Medical education reforms are also constantly underway,” said the PM, noting that todaymore doctors and paramedical manpower is graduating in India.Launching the digital mission on World Tourism Day, the PM said India was ensuring that ease of hospital care and hospitality move hand in hand.Earlier in his address, the PM said digital solutions were now available across sectors in the country on Aadhar, Jan Dhan, UPI, Internet and mobile platforms, and India’s COWIN was helping people with digital delivery of vaccines during Covid Times.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/health-id-for-every-citizen-pm-modi-launches-ayushman-bharat-digital-mission-316878
