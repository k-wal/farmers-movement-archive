29-09-2021||New Delhi||DDMA allows gatherings during festival season in Covid appropriate manner||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday decided to allow gatherings, including Ramleela celebrations, during the upcoming festival season with strict compliance to Covid norms, official sources said.The Delhi Police and district authorities will ensure proper seating arrangement at events by adhering to social distancing norms, separate entry and exit points at venues and no overcrowding at gatherings."They will make sure that gatherings during the festive season are strictly in compliance to standard operating procedures. They will ensure that no fairs and stalls are allowed and if the SOPs are not followed, then action will be taken against the organisers of the events," a source said.The decision was taken during a meeting chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy CM Manish Sisodia were not present in the meeting."After a detailed discussion with experts, the need to strictly follow and enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) was emphasised upon especially in wake of the upcoming festive season to prevent any resurgence of infection," Baijal tweeted after the meeting.The DDMA will issue another order with detailed SOPs in a few days, the sources said.According to the sources, experts in the meeting expressed satisfaction over the prevailing Covid situation in the national capital and efforts being made by the departments concerned to mitigate the spread of coronavirus yet strongly reiterated not to let their guards down.The Delhi chief secretary was directed to go through the SOPs for the festive season and synergise them with guidelines issued by the central government for effective management, they said.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain and Revenue Minister Kailash Gahlot, along with top experts and government officials, attended the meeting.Meanwhile, Ramleela organising committees in the city said it will be difficult for them to organise Ramleelas on a grand scale this year due to shortage of time."The DDMA's order of organising Ramleelas without fairs and grandeur is as good as doing nothing. Chances are bleak that we will organise Ramlila this year," Rajesh Khanna, secretary general of Shri Ramleela Committee, said."Preparations for organising Ramleela generally begin two to three months before its scheduled time, but this year we were not sure whether committees would be allowed to organise Ramleelas," he added.Dheeraj Dhar Gupta, general secretary, Dharmik Leela Committee, said the permission from the DDMA came "very late" and it is unlikely to organise Ramleela this year."The DDMA permission came very late and we also have to take approvals from many other departments which is hardly possible in a week's time," he said.The festival season will start with Navratri commencing in October and Durga Puja is celebrated during the same time. Dussehra falls on October 15 and Diwali on November 4 this year. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ddma-allows-gatherings-during-festival-season-in-covid-appropriate-manner-317938

Because a Scheduled Caste leader was elevated as CM, they ask who is taking decisions in the Congress. They cannot digest the promotion of an SC. The residence of home minister Amit Shah is the epicentre of anti-SC politics.”Surjewala said Amit Shah and PM Modi wanted to take revenge on Punjab because they have so far been unable to benefit their “friends through black farm laws”. “BJP’s anti-farmer conspiracy will not succeed,” Surjewala said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/those-questioning-congress-decisions-are-anti-sc-surjewala-317935
29-09-2021||Bengaluru||Karnataka High Court upholds death sentence to serial rapist-killer||The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday upheld the death sentence to serial rapist and killer Umesh Reddy on Wednesday, rejecting his petition to commute it to life imprisonment.A Division Bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and Pradeep Singh Yerur also gave six weeks to Reddy for filing an appeal in the Supreme Court.Reddy argued through his counsel that the mercy petition before the President is taking time and he is not in a sound state of mind.His mercy petition was rejected by the President in 2013. Presently, he is lodged in the Hindalaga Jail in Belagavi in a separate barrack earmarked for death row convicts, where he was shifted from Bengaluru Central Prison on October 26, 2006. Reddy, who, according to police, has confessed to killing 18 women, has been convicted in nine cases.Police say that he raped at least 20 women across Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Gujarat, and it is suspected that several of his crimes have not been reported as victims feared social stigma.Hailing from Karnataka'S Chitradurga district, he was posted in Jammu and Kashmir after being selected in the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). While on duty as a guard at the house of a commandant, he tried to rape the commandant's daughter. Later, he fled and managed to join the Karnataka Reserve Police.Reddy targeted housewives between 11 am and 3 pm, getting into the house on the pretext of asking for water or an address. He then threatened them with a knife, forced them to remove their clothes, tied them up, and raped them.He often choked his victims and raped them while they were unconscious. After the rape, Reddy killed his victims and robbed their jewels. He escaped with his victims' undergarments.He was arrested and dismissed from service when his one of the victim identified him at a Republic Day police parade. Reddy was found wearing women's lingerie under his clothes.After escaping from prison, he killed an income tax officer's wife in Bengaluru, a girl in Ahmedabad, two girls in Baroda and a widow in Kunigal, Karnataka.He was again arrested by Bengaluru police in July 1997 for stealing women's undergarments. The police recovered a sack full of lingerie from him.Reddy was sentenced to death on October 26, 2006, by a Bengaluru fast track court. On October 4, 2007, a Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court differed on the death sentence, and Justice SR Bannurmath, appointed to resolve the matter, upheld the death sentence. The Supreme Court also upheld capital punishment.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-high-court-upholds-death-sentence-to-serial-rapist-killer-317927

It also ordered the company to pay a cost of Rs 2 crores to the Resident Welfare Association (RWA).The RWA had filed a case against the illegal construction in 2012 on the ground that it blocked sunlight and fresh air, violating building norms “in collusion” with NOIDA officials.The twin towers of Emerald Court Project of Supertech in sector 93A of NOIDA had 915 apartments and 21 shops. Of these, 633 flats were booked initially. Supertech had said that out of 633 people booking the flats initially, 133 had moved out to other projects, 248 had taken refunds while 252 homebuyers still had bookings in the project.The Allahabad High Court had in April 2014 directed the NOIDA Authority to demolish the two towers in four months and reimburse the homebuyers’ money in four months with 14 percent interest compounded annually.The top court had said “the illegal construction has to be dealt with strictly to ensure compliance with the rule of law”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/noida-twin-towers-demolition-supertech-urges-sc-to-confine-demolition-to-one-tower-317925
29-09-2021||New Delhi||SC frowns on Rajasthan HC order restraining police from arresting accused in certain cases||The Supreme Court on Wednesday frowned upon a Rajasthan High Court order restraining the police from arresting accused in certain categories of cases in view of Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns.A Bench of Justice LN Rao and Justice Aniruddha Bose said the order potentially violated constitutional rights of individuals by putting fetters on power of investigation of the police.As the high court’s orders were applicable only till July 17, the Bench refrained from formally quashing them even as it allowed the appeal against the said orders.The top court had in May stayed a Rajasthan High Court’s controversial order restraining the police from arresting accused charged under offence punishable with a maximum sentence of up to three years till July 17 and not to list pre-arrest bail applications before the high court as well as sessions court.In a rare move, the Rajasthan High Court itself had approached the Supreme Court against its own single judge’s order to the DGP not to arrest such accused.The high court had challenged the order on the ground that the direction will “create a situation of lawlessness” and that it ignored the settled principle of law that Chief Justice is the “Master of Roster” of the HC.The single judge “erroneously violated” the principle of law, rulings and conventions by “interfering into the exclusive administrative jurisdiction of the Chief Justice”, the Rajasthan High Court submitted through its Registrar General.The Rajasthan Government had supported the high court’s submissions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-frowns-on-rajasthan-hc-order-restraining-police-from-arresting-accused-in-certain-cases-317924
29-09-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC upholds life term to 3 men in Pune gangrape case, slams trial court judge||The Bombay High Court has upheld an order of the Pune sessions court passed in 2011 convicting and sentencing three men to life imprisonment in a gangrape case, but made critical comments against defence lawyers and the judge in the case.In an order passed on September 28, a Bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and Sarang Kotwal, while upholding the conviction and life term, made some strong observations on the conduct of defence lawyers and the judge in the case, particularly during the cross-examination of the victim.The Bombay High Court said in the present case, the sessions judge “failed in his duty” to protect the dignity of the victim, an MBA graduate who was gangraped in the Hinjewadi area of Pune.The HC noted that the lawyers defending the accused persons had tried to suggest, among other things, that the victim had consumed alcohol and that she had had consensual sex with the accused.The high court questioned the silence of the prosecution during such cross-examination. It further remarked that the sessions judge, who heard the case, should not have remained passive and should have intervened when the lawyers subjected the victim, the primary witness in the case, to improper cross-examination.“As far as the main incident is concerned, some suggestions were given on behalf of accused No.1 which show that the defence was trying to develop a theory of consensual sex,” the Bench said.“Once she had denied suggestion of consensual sex, further suggestions were put to her regarding graphic details of the act. These further suggestions were wholly unnecessary,” it observed.The HC said such a line of questioning could not be considered a “proper cross-examination”.“We strongly disapprove all these suggestions put to the witness. We are more pained because of the passive approach adopted by the learned Judge in allowing these questions,” the HC said.“These suggestions crossed all lines of basic dignity. Under the garb of giving suggestions, graphic details of the act were put to the witness. This was wholly unwarranted.”“The learned Judge has recorded that at that stage the witness was sobbing. The learned Judge should have intervened and stopped this line of cross-examination,” it said.The HC said all courts are duty-bound to forbid any questions that might be offensive or meant to insult someone.It further said that in the present case, the sessions judge failed to inform the woman that she must not feel compelled to answer the unwarranted questions.The Bench, however, said that while the cross-examination was questionable, there did not exist any infirmity in the session court’s order convicting and sentencing the three accused persons to life imprisonment.The HC said it did not find any reason to interfere with the Pune court’s order and thus upheld the life terms awarded to the accused—Subhash Hiralal Bhosale, Ganesh Uttam Kambale, and Ranjit Shahaji Gade.The victim was gangraped by the accused near Information Technology Park at Mankar Chowk in Wakad on the outskirts of Pune on April 1, 2010, after she accepted a lift in their car.The incident had highlighted the lack of security for women working in the Hinjewadi area, where several IT companies are located. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bombay-hc-upholds-life-term-to-3-men-in-pune-gangrape-case-slams-trial-court-judge-317921

Senior Congress leaders like Manish Tewari have expressed concern over the situation in the state as Punjab's stability is important for national security, he added.He also accused the Congress of targeting journalists to “divert the attention from the Punjab crisis”. Though he did not name anyone, his comments appeared to be aimed at reactions from some Congress leaders following the use of unparliamentary word by an anchor that appeared aimed at Rahul Gandhi.The woman anchor had apologised later.Patra said a woman journalist is being attacked and threatened and asked media bodies like the NBA and Editors Guild to take cognisance, targeting Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel for his tweet that Congress members will never tolerate indecent language against Gandhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-slams-rahul-gandhi-for-punjab-crisis-says-situation-in-border-state-worrisome-317916

It also flagged encroachment on public land.“The public health inspector again inspected the site on September 24 and found that the trade is running under the same condition. You are directed to close the trade within 48 hours of the receipt of this notice failing which suitable action, including sealing will be taken without assigning further notice,” the SDMC notice issued to the restaurant-owner said.In his response on September 27, the owner said, “I have closed-down the above said trade immediately and I shall not run the same trade without SDMC Trade Licence under insanitary condition from health point of view and create nuisance.”In a social media post last week a woman had alleged she was refused entry in the south Delhi restaurant because she was wearing a saree.The woman had also posted a short video of her argument with the restaurant staff, alongside a couple of pictures of herself in the saree.Later, the restaurant claimed that the incident was “misrepresented”.In the SDMC House meeting Wednesday, Congress councillor from Andrews Ganj Abhishek Dutt raised the issue and moved a proposal demanding a fine of Rs 5 lakh be imposed against any restaurant, bar or hotel that denies entry to any person wearing traditional Indian attire.“The restaurant was running illegally without licence. The notice was issued to the eatery only after I raised the issue. Now, the authorities have informed that the restaurant has been shut. It is a matter of probe that how the restaurant was running without a licence,” he told PTI.Taking cognisance of the case the National Commission for Women (NCW) had on September 23 had asked the Delhi Police to probe the incident.

I have the same ideology and principles. Today when I am joining the TMC, my dream is to bring together this Congress family. I should try to ensure that the Congress family is again united. My main aim is to defeat the BJP.“The Congress family is the TMC, Indira Congress, YSR Congress, the Sharad Pawar Congress. The Congress is fragmented. We have to unite all these forces and bring them together. It is only under the leadership of Mamata Banerjee that various factions of the Congress can unite and put up a fight against the BJP,” said Faleiro.Claiming that Banerjee has destroyed the BJP’s agenda, he said she is a street fighter and the moment has come for everybody to join her as “Didi will bring in a new dawn... They could not break Didi’s indomitable spirit.” Stating that time has come to bring back India on track of secularism, democracy, and growth, Faleiro said he is confident that “Mamata             Banerjee will lead the opposition and fight against the BJP”.Faleiro, who quit the Congress on Monday after 40 years of association, refused to criticize the Gandhi family or the Congress leadership.“If you expect me to criticise the Congress leadership, I will not. I had a 40-year association with the party,” he said when asked to comment on the group of 23 senior party leaders, described as the G-23, raising questions against the leadership.The former Goa CM joined the TMC in presence of party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and other senior leaders such as Sougata Ray and Subrata Mukherjee.Abhishek said the TMC will contest the 2022 Goa assembly election on its own.“We are going to fight the upcoming polls in Goa on our own. Hopes this puts to rest all speculations,” he said.Earlier in the day, Faleiro and a few other Congress leaders from Goa met TMC supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.“It’s a matter of great pride for me to welcome Former Goa CM, 7-time MLA and stalwart Goan leader Shri@luizinhofaleiro to the Trinamool Congress family. Together we will stand up for every Goan, fight divisive forces and work towards ushering in a NEW DAWN for Goa,” she tweeted.She also welcomed several other leaders from Goa such as former MGP MLA Lavoo Mamledar, Congress general secretaries Yatish Naik and Vijay Poi, Sahitya Akademi Award-winning poet Shivdas Sonu Naik and others into the party.The TMC, which is making efforts to increase its footprint nationally, has been trying to make inroads in Goa. Top TMC leaders including Derek O’Brien were in the coastal state last week.Faleiro’s induction is expected to boost the party’s prospects in poll-bound Goa.Underling his reason for joining the TMC, Faleiro said, “Goa is today going backwards and facing an economic meltdown. The state is suffering under the BJP’s rule. The economic situation of the state is abysmal. It is suffering from maladministration and misplaced policies”. He said Goa needs a credible alternative.“I have joined the TMC because Goa needs a credible alternative. I request TMC chairperson Mamata Banerjee to visit Goa and help Goans fight the divisive forces which are destroying our ethos, culture, and identity,” Faleiro said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-goa-cm-faleiro-joins-tmc-calls-for-uniting-factions-of-congress-under-mamata-317903
29-09-2021||Bhubaneswar||Odisha Police to take Interpol's help in DRDO espionage case||The Odisha Police, which is probing the espionage case at DRDO's Interim Test Range (ITR), said on Tuesday it will take the help of Interpol through central agencies to reach the mysterious woman who had allegedly engaged five ITR employees in leaking defence information to a foreign agent.The additional director general of Odisha Police crime branch, Sanjeev Panda, said the photograph of the woman operative has been obtained along with her video footage from video calls with the accused persons. “We will establish contact with the Interpol to track down the mysterious lady handler who had been eliciting information from the five accused," he said. The probe agency has obtained proof that the mysterious woman had managed to hack the mobile phone of one of the accused for around eight months and kept a tab on his activities. She had also managed to steal vital information about the ITR, Chandipur, Panda said. The Odisha may seek further custody of the five accused persons, who are now in judicial custody, after verification of certain documents, he added. One of the accused has received Rs 38,000 in two installments from Dubai. “However, we have to establish whether the money came from the bank account of the woman or from someone else," he said. The woman had used a UK SIM card to contact the five employees of the  Defense Research and Development Organisation who were arrested on September 14 and 16 for allegedly passing on vital defense related information to foreign agencies in lieu of money and other promises, including that of marriage.The woman posing as a resident of Balasore district spoke to the five accused, unknown to each other, and stayed connected with them using seven Facebook accounts under different names, besides WhatsApp, Panda had said earlier.She frequently video-called two of the accused and even gave marriage proposals to them. The woman had also invited one of them to ''her residence'' in Chandipur, he had said on the alleged honey-trap angle to the espionage case.Meanwhile, the intelligence wing of the Indian Air Force has interrogated the five accused persons during their police remand. Two National Investigating Agency officers had visited the ITR and discussed the issue of security at the DRDO establishment from where major missiles are test fired. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/odisha-police-to-take-interpols-help-in-drdo-espionage-case-317895
29-09-2021||Kolkata||Mamata BJP’s Trojan Horse, must be kept out of opposition platform: Adhir Chowdhury||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was the Trojan Horse of the BJP and should be kept out of all efforts to cobble up an opposition platform ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, senior Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury alleged on Wednesday.In an interview with PTI, Chowdhury said Banerjee was an “untrustworthy ally”, trying to grow nationally at the cost of the Congress.“Mamata Banerjee has always tried to bite the hand that fed her. She should be kept out of the efforts to form opposition unity. She is the Trojan Horse of the BJP, who can never be trusted in the fight against the BJP,” he said.“She is desperately trying to please Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP to protect her family and party leaders from the clutches of the CBI and ED. In return, she is helping the BJP achieve its target of Congress-mukt Bharat (Congress-free India). The TMC is trying to sabotage the opposition unity,” claimed Chowdhury, the state president of the Congress.He said that TMC has always grown at the cost of Congress.“First, they did it in Bengal, and now they are trying to do it nationally. The TMC is known for backstabbing its allies,” he claimed.His comments came as the Trinamool Congress has been inducting Congress leaders to bolster its national presence. Among the heavyweight Congress leaders who joined the TMC are Sushmita Dev and former Goa chief minister Luizinho Faleiro.“Mamata Banerjee is dreaming of becoming the next prime minister of the country, and Congress seems to be their biggest roadblock. As long as the Congress is there, she can never be the leader of the opposition front, and that is why she is trying to tarnish the image of the Congress and undermine its leadership,” Chowdhury said.On an article in the TMC’s mouthpiece that claimed Banerjee and not Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is the opposition face against Modi, he said the party’s leadership was living in a “fool’s paradise”.“Rahul Gandhi has been the most consistent opposition voice against the BJP and the RSS. Congress still commands a 20 per cent vote share in the country. Apart from BJP, can you name any other party with such a vote share? The answer is no,” he said.Lauding Gandhi’s leadership, Chowdhury said the BJP and certain opposition parties deliberately try to discredit him as they were “afraid of him”.He said the Congress has never claimed to be the leader of the opposition front as it was the “natural leader”.“Without Congress, there can never be any anti-BJP front in the country. The opposition unity is based on shared ideas and policies, and should not be at the cost of the Congress,” he said.On the crisis in the party’s Punjab unit, Chowdhury said that he hoped it would be resolved soon.“Congress is a liberal party, and we allow everybody to place their opinions. Amarinder Singh is a respected leader and no one has ever doubted his administrative capabilities. But, the change of guard was necessary due to growing incumbency in Punjab and a large section of MLAs wanted the change,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-bjps-trojan-horse-must-be-kept-out-of-opposition-platform-adhir-chowdhury-317894

The rest are operated by Delhi government agencies.This is not good news for the rest of the 106 municipal wards for Delhi in which no liquor shops will open till November 16.The Delhi government has made its new liquor policy public in the month of July which states equal distribution of liquor outlets in the national capital.The policy made itself clear that the government will exit the business of selling liquor through its undertaking.The equal distribution of liquor outlets includes at least two air-conditioned vends in every municipal ward, five super-premium stores, and 10 stores at the Indira Gandhi International Airport.It is being done to eliminate overcharging and brand influence. In contrast to the older policy in which the licensee is not allowed to give any discount or rebate on the MRP, the new policy will leave the licensee to decide on these matters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-liquor-shortage-crisis-could-worsen-in-coming-months-as-new-excise-policy-comes-into-force-from-november-16-317872
29-09-2021||Malappuram (Kerala)||PM is breaking relationships between Indian people: Rahul Gandhi||Congress MP from Wayanad Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of breaking the relationships and "bridges" between the people and claimed that this was leading to "shattering" of the idea of India.Rahul Gandhi, in Kerala for a day, also alleged that it was "arrogance" on the part of the Prime Minister to claim that only he knows or understands India and no one else, especially when he was making the claims without finding out about the culture, language, way of life and problems of the people of the various states and religions.The Congress leader, while speaking at the inauguration of a dialysis centre in Malappuram district of Kerala, said that India was not just a geographical territory, it was the people living here and the relationships they have with each other."My problem with the Prime Minister is that he is breaking these relationships. If he is breaking the relationships between people of India, then he is shattering the idea of India. That is why I oppose him," he said."When he (PM) breaks the relationships between Indians, it is my duty, my job, my commitment to repair the bridges between the people. Every time he uses hatred to break bridges, it is my duty to repair them with love and compassion," he added.The Congress MP said he could not build the bridges without understanding the different traditions, ideas, religions and cultures in the country and for that one needs to visit the various states and religious places in the country with humility and the willingness to understand."If I go to these places with arrogance, then I am a fool. How can I go to people of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, who have a history of thousands of years, and claim to know them. I have to go there with humility. Otherwise, how can I define what India is?" "Imagine the arrogance of that person who claims -- 'I know what India is. I know what people of Kerala need. I know what people of Tamil Nadu need.' Imagine the arrogance of such a person who claims that only he knows what India is and what people of India need. This is another problem that I have with Prime Minister Modi. He is convinced nobody understands this land like he does," the Congress leader said.Therefore, the fight here is between humility and arrogance, between temper and compassion, between self-interest and welfare of others, he added.

29-09-2021||Thrissur||This Muslim woman cremates bodies of Hindus at a Kerala crematorium||While lighting the tiny oil brass lamp with cloth wicks every morning at the crematorium and waiting for the dead to arrive, Subeena Rahman never thinks of her religion.With a shawl draped over her head, the Muslim woman, in her late 20s, knows better than anyone now that death has no religion and everyone is  alone and empty-handed during their final journey.Working as a crematorium keeper at a Hindu crematorium in Irinjalakuda in this central Kerala district for the last three years, this young undergraduate said she had cremated hundreds of corpses, including those of over 250 Covid positive people, so far.Even dripping with sweat in a PPE kit for hours while cremating the bodies of Covid victims back-to-back during the second wave of the pandemic, she never forgot to pray for the departed souls in her own way without the barrier of religion or belief.Rahman, who has shattered gender stereotypes by turning a cremator, which is generally seen an odd job even by men, is considered to be the first woman from the Muslim community to take up the profession in the southern state.However, the 28-year-old is bold enough to admit that it is not for breaking any glass ceiling but for earning daily bread for her family, sustain her husband and look after her ailing father, who was a wood-cutter.She also does not mind asking to give her a job to those who are opposing and mocking her for being a crematorium keeper."The sight of motionless bodies, with closed eyes and cotton stuffed in nostrils, was a nightmare for me just like any other child. But, the dead bodies no longer scare me," Rahman told PTI.She said she had never ever imagined that she would turn a crematorium keeper as her childhood dream was to become a police officer."It is destiny that I should shoulder this responsibility and I am doing this job with utmost sincerity and dedication. I have never felt any regret for taking up this profession because I strongly believe that every job has its own dignity...and I am proud of what I am doing," she said.Subeena Rahman was desperately looking for a job when she came to know about a vacancy in the SNBS Samajam Mukthisthan crematorium, run by the Ezhavas, a powerful backward Hindu community.Besides Hindus, the bodies of Christian community members are also cremated at the gas crematorium.Initially, her parents had concerns regarding the workplace, but she was adamant to take the job as she knew she had to support her family.Though there was no visible opposition from anyone, including her community members, many expressed doubt whether the Hindu community would accept a Muslim woman as cremator.According to Hindu traditions, women are not allowed to visit the cremation ground."Many people discouraged me saying the Hindu community members would not accept a woman, especially belonging to another religion for the job. But, no one has raised any objections so far and I could prove myself that gender and religion are no barrier for doing any job," a confident Rahman said.The whole-hearted support extended by her husband, a daily wage earner, and his family and son Mohammed Irfan, was a great source of strength.After completing the daily chores in the morning at home, Rahman rushes to the crematorium by 9.30 am.With her two male colleagues, she cleans up the premises, removing the remnants of previous day's cremation and light the oil lamp, marking the beginning of the duty.There were days when she had to work continuously for 14 hours, especially during the peak of Covid period."We get Rs 500 each per body, which is split among the three. Normally, we get six to seven bodies every day. But there were days when we had to cremate 12 Covid patients back-to-back," Rahman reminisced.Asked whether she remembers the first cremation she had performed, the young woman says it was a 65-year-old man named Siddharthan, who died of heart failure.The most painful occasion was the cremation of a five-year-old girl who slipped into a village pond accidentally and died."Her father was abroad. He came to see his daughter for the last time at the crematorium wearing a PPE kit. He broke down when he handed over the body of the little girl to me to take to the furnace. I could not control myself then," the woman said.Otherwise, she would not carry any memories or faces, which she comes across at the crematorium while returning home and engaging in her evening chores at home."I am fully aware now that we cannot stop death. It will come to us all.. If we are born, death will surely follow us. There is no escape from it," Rahman concludes on a philosophical note.

29-09-2021||Mumbai||ED summons Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawali for questioning in PMLA case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawali for questioning on October 4 in a money laundering case registered against her and others, official sources said on Wednesday.Gawali, 48, is a member of the Lok Sabha from the Yavatmal-Washim seat in Maharashtra.The Shiv Sena MP has been asked to depose before the investigating officer of the case at the ED office located in South Mumbai, they said.The agency on Tuesday arrested her aide Saeed Khan in this criminal case filed under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The agency, while taking the custody of Khan, claimed before a special PMLA court here on Tuesday that Gawali criminally conspired to convert a trust into a private company through Khan by “forgery and fraud” for layering of funds worth around Rs 18 crore.Khan was sent to ED custody till October 1 by the court.It is understood that the agency wants to question Gawali about her links with Khan and the trust identified as ‘Mahila Utkarsha Pratishthan’ and related transactions.The ED had told the court that its investigation so far suggested that misappropriation of funds to the tune of Rs 18.18 crore and theft of Rs 7 crore (cash) have been layered.The agency said the trust filed for conversion into a Section 8 company by alleged fraudulent forgery of signatures of the management and documents from public institutions.The total assets of Rs 69 crore in the book value (of the trust) were transferred to the newly formed Section 8 company limited, the agency told the court.The Companies Act defines a Section 8 company as the one whose objective is to promote fields of arts, commerce, science, research, education, sports, charity, social welfare, religion, environment protection, or other similar objectives.The directors of this company, according to the ED, are Khan and Shalinitai Gawali, the mother of the Sena MP.Bhavana Gawali along with the two is stated to be a member of this company.“It is stated that Bhavana Gawali, through her aide Saeed Khan, Shergul Khan and his accomplices have criminally conspired to convert the Trust ‘Mahila Utkarsha Pratishthan’ into a Section 8 company through forgery and fraud for the purpose of layering the trust fund,” the ED alleged.Initial probe shows that there is a huge cash deposit and the withdrawal of bigger amounts from the account of the trust maintained at the Risod Urban cooperative society.    Then branch manager of Risod Urban cooperative society in his statement stated that the society was not entitled to receive a cash deposit of more than Rs 3 lakh.However, there are multiple cash deposits of much bigger amounts followed by the withdrawal of the same amount on the same day. He (the manager) also stated that these transactions were merely book entries and no physical cash was moved. This was all done on specific instructions of Bhavana Gawali, the ED claimed.Thus, it has come to light that the complaints alleging misappropriation of funds of Rs 18.18 crore and theft of Rs 7 crore (cash) are layered, the probe agency said.The ED counsel claimed that Khan had played an active role in forging documents and creating companies.Khan’s lawyer opposed the ED argument, and said, “Let them (ED) show if any money has come to my account...there is nothing against me ....I am targeted because I am affiliated to a state party.” The ED case is based on an FIR registered by Risod police station in Washim district for cheating and criminal breach of trust.The agency had last month conducted searches in this case at multiple premises in Yavatmal, Washim and Mumbai.

He sought bail on the ground that he never participated in any protest or the riots at any point in time and the place on a record by the prosecution did not place him anywhere close to the scene of the crime.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-a-pre-planned-conspiracy-hc-317596

Under the guise of employment of a few, we cannot permit others to infringe the right to life of other citizens,” a Bench led by Justice MR Shah said while dealing with the issue of ban on firecrackers.“Our prime focus is the right to life of innocent citizens. If we find green crackers are there and accepted by the committee of experts, we will pass suitable orders,” the Bench said, adding that in our country, the main difficulty was implementation. “Laws are there but ultimately implementation has to be there. Our order should be implemented in true spirit,” it noted.Refusing to impose a complete ban on sale of firecrackers earlier, the court had said sale could happen through only licensed traders and that only green crackers could be sold. Online sale of firecrackers has been completely banned.On behalf of firecrackers manufacturers’ association, senior counsel Atmaram Nadkarni said in view of the upcoming Diwali on November 4, they wanted Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) to take a decision on the issue.He said the government should decide the matter as lakhs of people were employed in the industry. The case must be heard and taken to its logical end, but the plight of lakhs of people working in the firecracker industry should be taken into account, he added.On behalf of petitioner Arjun Gopal, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan said the court had directed that PESO would give the final clearance to safe firecrackers.Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, representing the Ministry of Environment and Forests, said the ministry had in October 2020 filed an affidavit and if the Bench considered it, all the interim applications would be covered. Experts have suggested formulations on the issue of green crackers, she said.The court asked Sankaranarayanan to submit a separate compilation of orders and posted it for hearing on Wednesday.The Bench said everyday there was a violation of orders and in every religious event, victory processions, marriages, it could see flouting of its orders. “We will have to fix liability on someone, else this will not stop at all,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/need-to-strike-balance-between-rights-to-life-employment-sc-317597

It’s a matter of only a week...nothing will happen.”Sibal said the CBI was issuing notices to police officers in various cases. But the Bench said it won’t pass any orders without hearing the other side.During the hearing, Sibal said the High Court violated the principles of natural justice of the state government in transferring post-poll violence cases to the CBI as only seven days were given to state police to probe thousands of complaints and whatever was said by state wasn’t considered by the HC.The West Bengal Government had on September 1 moved the top court against the Calcutta High Court’s order for a CBI probe into the incidents of murder and rape, allegedly committed by TMC supporters targeting BJP workers after the Assembly election results were declared on May 2.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-poll-violence-sc-notice-on-wbs-petition-against-cbi-probe-317598

The surrendered terrorist, Ali Babar Patra, was a resident Punjab (Pakistan). The report, ‘Terrorist and Other Militant Groups in Pakistan’, released by the research wing of the US Congress, said the Pakistan-based groups could be broadly categorised into five types – globally oriented, Afghanistan-oriented, India and Kashmir-oriented, domestically oriented and sectarian (anti-Shia).The prominent India-centric groups include Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Harakat-ul Jihad Islami and Hizb-ul Mujahideen.

Better marketing of honey will result in better prices to farmers. Improvement in the quality and branding of honey will result in an increase in exports, and add to the contribution of the agriculture sector to the foreign exchange reserves,” Tomar said. According to National Bee Board Executive Director Navin Patle, a honey-testing laboratory has been set up in Gujarat under the National Mission on Beekeeping and Honey. “Honey-testing laboratories are also being established in Delhi and Bangalore. The quality of honey produced by FPOs will be assured through proper testing,” he said.In order to identify and aggregate beekeepers and other stakeholders, 100 FPO clusters are being set up across the country, including Punjab (Patiala, Ludhiana and Bathinda), Haryana (Hisar and Yamunanagar), Himachal Pradesh (Solan and Chamba) and J&K (Pulwama, Kupwara, Ramban and Baramulla), Patle said.“The Centre has allocated Rs 500 crore for the National Beekeeping and Honey Mission from the current financial year (2020-2021) to 2022-2023,” he explained, adding that work is also being done on the possibilities of connecting beekeeping with dairy cooperatives and unions.“There is a huge scope in honey production given its immense health benefits. Honey production in India increased from 76,150 MT in 2013-14 to 1,25,000 MT in 2020-21 and export from 28,378.42 MT in 2013-14 to 59,999 MT in 2020-21.

Beekeepers will have the choice of flower/plant they want to use for making honey,” Patle added.Meanwhile the Centre has established Madhukranti Portal for online registration to find the source of honey as well as other beehive products. Sixteen Integrated Beekeeping Development Centres in various states will serve as role models for beekeeping, officials said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/the-buzz-india-for-honey-revolution-317588

Both leaders met former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi before addressing mediapersons even as sections of party leaders privately expressed unease with Kanhaiya’s joining.The former JNUSU chief’s past (arrested for sedition in 2016 for raising Azadi slogans on JNU campus after the hanging of Afzal Guru), a section of Congress felt, could hurt Congress’ long term political consolidation plans with the BJP fanning “anti-national rhetoric”.BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya tweeted, “On the anniversary of the surgical strike, Congress to admit Kanhaiya and Mevani of ‘Bharat tere tukde honge’ fame. This can’t be a mere coincidence.”For the Congress, the arrival of young leaders fits into Rahul’s urge to build a “new aggressive party”, a development former minister Manish Tewari compared with times when late PM Indira Gandhi started to veer Leftward.Citing on Twitter the 1973 book “Communists in Congress: Kumarmanglam Thesis”, Tewari said, “The more things change the more they perhaps remain the same.”The reference was to late Indira Gandhi who had started to lean towards the Left.With Kanhaiya’s arrival, the Leftward slant has become evident.Explaining why he left the CPI, Kanhaiya said, “I think the way it (CPI) is fighting today, we need to increase the speed and break ideological rigidity. Should all parties not mark the birth anniversary of Shaheed Bhagat Singh? If the country is on fire, can we stay off saying we will only save our house?

29-09-2021||New Delhi||Complete ban on bursting, sale of firecrackers up to January 1 in Delhi||The Delhi Pollution Control Committee on Tuesday ordered a complete ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers in the national capital till January 1, 2022.According to the order, several experts have indicated a possibility of another surge of Covid-19 and largescale celebrations by bursting of firecrackers will result not only in agglomeration of people in violation of social distancing norms but also a high level of air pollution leading to serious health issues in Delhi.The bursting of firecrackers under the prevalent pandemic crisis is not favourable for the cause of larger community health given the significant relationship between air pollution and respiratory infections, it said.“There will be a ‘complete ban’ on bursting and sale of all kinds of firecrackers up to 1.1.2022 in the territory of NCT of Delhi,” the DPCC’s order stated.The DPCC has also asked district magistrates and deputy commissioners of police to implement the directions and submit daily action taken reports to it.

29-09-2021||New Delhi||2020 Delhi riots a ‘pre-planned conspiracy’, says Delhi HC||The northeast Delhi riots that shook the nation last year were a “pre-planned conspiracy” to disturb law and order in the national capital and the violence didn’t take place in a spur of the moment, the Delhi High Court has said.While refusing to grant bail to accused Mohd Ibrahim in the case of the murder of Delhi Police head constable Ratan Lal, Justice Subramonium Prasad on Monday noted that there was a systematic disconnection and destruction of the CCTV cameras in areas near the place of the incident and innumerable rioters ruthlessly descended with sticks, ‘dandas’, bats, etc. upon a hopelessly outnumbered cohort of police officials.However, it granted bail to another accused Saleem Khan in the absence of any material to show that he was a part of the unlawful assembly at the crime scene.Around 53 people, including constable Ratan Lal, were killed and 700 others injured in the riots that broke out in northeast Delhi during the then US President Donald Trump’s India visit in February last year.Rejecting the bail plea of Ibrahim, Justice Prasad said the conduct of the protesters present in the video footage placed on record by the prosecution visibly portrayed that it was a calculated attempt to dislocate the functioning of the government as well as to disrupt the normal life of the people in the city.Individual liberty cannot be misused in a manner that threatens the very fabric of civilised society by attempting to destabilise it and cause hurt to other persons, the HC said even as it acknowledged the importance of personal liberty in a democratic polity.The available video footage showing the petitioner with a sword was quite egregious and sufficient to keep him in custody, the court noted.Ibrahim has been in judicial custody since his arrest in December 2020. He sought bail on the ground that he never participated in any protest or the riots at any point in time and the place on a record by the prosecution did not place him anywhere close to the scene of the crime.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2020-delhi-riots-a-pre-planned-conspiracy-says-delhi-hc-317433
29-09-2021||Aditi Tandon||Kanhaiya Kumar joins Congress to ‘save idea of India’, questions Left’s ‘rigidity’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 28CPI leader and former JNU Students Union chief Kanhaiya Kumar on Tuesday joined the Congress saying he wanted to save the idea of India and believed the grand old party alone could lead the ongoing ideological battle against the BJP.Independent MLA from Gujarat’s Vadgam Jignesh Mevani also “joined in spirit” saying he could not formally take up the AICC membership as he was still a sitting MLA.“I am with the Congress and will contest next elections on a Congress symbol,” Mevani said.Both leaders met former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi before addressing reporters even as sections of party leaders privately expressed unease with Kanhaiya’s joining.The ex JNUSU chief’s past (he was arrested for sedition in 2016 for shouting Azadi slogans on JNU campus after the hanging of terrorist Afzal Guru), a section of Congress felt, could hurt Congress’ long term political consolidation plans with the BJP fanning “anti-national rhetoric” starting today.Ahead of Kanhaiya’s joining, BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya tweeted, “On the anniversary of the surgical strike, Congress to admit Kanhaiya Kumar and Jignesh Mewani of “Bharat tere tukde honge” fame. This can’t be a mere coincidence. Joining hands with “Breaking India” forces is now Congress’s raison d’être.”For the Congress, the arrival of young leaders fits into Rahul Gandhi’s urge to build a “new aggressive party”, a development former minister Manish Tewari compared with times when late prime minister Indira Gandhi started to veer Left ward. Citing on Twitter the 1973 book “Communists in Congress: Kumarmanglam Thesis”, Tewari said, “The more things change the more they perhaps remain the same.”The reference was to late Indira Gandhi who had started to learn towards the Left and even had in her cabinet card carrying member of the Communist Party Mohan Kumaramangalam who enunciated the Kumaramangalam thesis. The thesis spoke of Congress-Communist arrangement in terms of “Unity and Struggle”—Left struggles against Congress’ anti people policies and unites with it on socialist programmes.With Kanhaiya Kumar’s arrival in Congress today, the Leftward slant has become evident.Explaining why he left the CPI, Kanhaiya said, “I think the way it (CPI) is fighting today, we need to increase the speed and break ideological rigidity. Should all parties not mark the birth anniversary of Shaheed Bhagat Singh? Should all party offices not have the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi? If the country is on fire, can we stay off saying we will only save our house? The question of left and right has become irrelevant. We are facing a man who is a modern day Govinda (PM Narendra Modi) and keeps changing his form. We have to come together.”Kumar, who lost the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Bihar’s Begusarai, said he was joining a “democratic Congress because he believed that if the Congress did not survive, the country would also not survive”. Calling the Congress the largest opposition party, he added, “If the big ship is not saved, small boats will also drown.”Kanhaiya said there was a direct BJP-Congress fight in 200 of the 545 Lok Sabha seats, adding, “It is my historical responsibility to join the Congress and work to save the idea of India.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kanhaiya-kumar-joins-congress-to-save-idea-of-india-questions-lefts-rigidity-317423
