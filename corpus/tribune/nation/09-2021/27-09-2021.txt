The plot of land was surrendered to WBHIDCO in August 2020.“The country always stands by the sportspersons, especially who represent the country in international events. It is also a fact that Sourav Ganguly has brought laurels for the country in cricket.“But when it comes to law, our Constitutional Scheme is that all are equal and no one can claim to be exclusive, above the law and seek benefits from the state, especially when question arises for allotment of plots for commercial ventures,” the Bench observed.No one ever raises a finger when the government showers awards and benefits to sportspersons when they win any tournament, “but this system is not to continue in perpetuity”, it said.The Bench said if Ganguly is interested in development of sports, especially cricket, in which he has many achievements to his credit, there may be already many state sports establishments, he can associate himself with them and motivate budding cricketers.Nothing was placed before the court as regards any rules, regulations which permit HIDCO to accept surrender of the plot and refund the amount deposited, but still the procedure was followed, the Bench said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/calcutta-hc-imposes-cost-on-bcci-chief-ganguly-bengal-govt-for-out-of-turn-allotment-of-land-316978
27-09-2021||New Delhi||ICMR experts favour phased reopening of schools with multi-layered Covid mitigation steps||Schools need to be reopened in a phased manner, starting with primary sections with proper implementation of multi-layered Covid-19 mitigation measures, according to experts at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).In an opinion piece published in The Indian Journal of Medical Research, the experts cited a UNESCO report which stated that school closures in India for more than 500 days have affected over 320 million children. It has hit hard children from the relatively deprived hamlets and slums with many not being able to read more than a few words.A survey has found that students missed out on social interactions, lacked physical activity and had a sense of loosening the bonds of friendship due to prolonged school closures, mentioned the piece ‘Reopening of schools during Covid-19 pandemic: A persistent dilemma’.In the opinion piece that has synthesised scientific evidence from within India and abroad on the justification for reopening of schools, experts said knowing that Covid-19 transmission is an “over-dispersed” phenomenon, testing strategies in schools could serve as key interventions to check the potential spread of the virus.It must also be acknowledged that Covid testing strategies in schools should act as an adjunct and not substitute to other organisational and behavioural interventions, stated the perspective by Tanu Anand, Balram Bhargava and Samiran Panda.Evidence indicates that restoration of functioning of the education system as it was in pre-Covid times, as early as possible appears prudent in the current Indian context, they said.“However, it would be necessary to examine state-specific as well as district-specific data on earlier waves of infection and the status of adult vaccination coverage to project any plausible third wave and its potential intensity to inform decisions related to schools reopening.”“It is recommended that schools should have access to on-site testing facilities according to existing country-specific guidelines. Temporary or localised closures of a class or school may occur depending upon the local community transmission levels or if Covid-19 indicators worsen.”School teachers, staff and those involved in the transportation of children should be vaccinated on an emergent basis and continue to use a mask even after receiving the jabs, the experts underlined.This combination intervention is critical as vaccination against Covid-19 does not prevent acquisition or transmission of infection, and it is true for adults and children.“Opening of schools under this combination-intervention will ensure not only continuity of in-person learning but also instil confidence among parents that schools are safe for their children,” they said.Covid-19 vaccine trials for children and adolescents are still ongoing in India. Available evidence suggests that those aged 12 years and above are at a high risk of contracting the infection. Therefore, they must be prioritised for vaccination compared to the younger children, the experts said.To get the maximum benefits of reopening schools, the opinion piece highlighted the need for devising proactive multi-layered mitigation strategies to create an optimal learning environment for the children with a reduced risk of transmission.Consistent and appropriate use of masks, implementation of a standard protocol for sanitisation and hand washing are the key pillars of Covid-appropriate behaviour and must be practised by students and school staff alike.Ensuring the provision for such behaviour change practices requires planning and resource allocation by school authorities, the experts highlighted.While masks are not recommended for children under five years, six to 11-year old children may wear a mask depending on their ability to use them safely and appropriately. Those aged 12 years and above should wear masks under the same conditions as adults, they said.Schools should ensure that the indoors are well ventilated and air conditioners should be avoided. Exhaust fans should be installed in classrooms to curtail the potential spread of infection.Also, children should be advised against sharing meals, spending long hours in canteens or dining halls.Referring to the open-air classes propagated by Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore at Santiniketan, Anand, Bhargava and Panda said, “Covid-19 has forced us to explore and discover innovative learning methods, particularly in nature’s lap.”They said there is ample evidence to suggest that children aged 1-17 years have similar susceptibility to a mild form of Covid-19 as in adults.“However, the risk of severe disease and mortality in children when compared to adults is much less,” the experts said.Anecdotal evidence from India also points towards a sporadic rise in Covid cases in states that initiated the reopening of schools after the first wave. All these points towards over-dispersed phenomenon in Covid-19 transmission in various settings, they said.It should also be noted that global evidence suggests schools as “non-drivers” of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community, the experts underlined.

27-09-2021||New Delhi||CJI takes exception to frequent mentioning of corporate matters for urgent listing||Taking exception to lawyers frequently mentioning corporate matters for urgent listing, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Monday said he would streamline the system of mentioning urgent cases.The CJI, who was hearing a three-judge Bench, made the comments after senior counsel CU Singh mentioned a corporate matter for the priority listing.Noting that cases of the weaker sections and criminal matters were taking a backseat, the CJI said, “We have to wait. We are streamlining the (mentioning) system and here corporations want their matters to be listed first.”Referring to pending criminal appeals, family disputes, and cases of poor people, the CJI said, “There are pending criminal appeals, bail matters, and other cases of people of weaker sections too. They are lagging behind”.After taking over as the CJI in April, Justice Ramana had discontinued the practice of allowing direct mentioning of cases for urgent listing before the benches and has instead asked the lawyers to mention their cases before the designated official.Instead, he had started a new system of mentioning cases for urgent hearings before top court officials instead of directly before Benches to ensure that senior lawyers were not given “special priority”.“We do not want to give any special priority to the senior lawyers and deprive the junior lawyers of their opportunities. So this system was made, where all can make the mention before the mentioning Registrar," he had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-takes-exception-to-frequent-mentioning-of-corporate-matters-for-urgent-listing-316964
27-09-2021||New Delhi||DGCA asks aviation operators to conduct random dope test of their staff from January 31||The civil aviation regulator DGCA on Monday issued a final order asking all the scheduled commercial aircraft operators to carry out random drug testing on flight crew members and air traffic controllers with a view to curb possible use of psychoactive substances, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, cannabis, opioids and others by aviation personnel.The Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in its order, a copy of which is with The Tribune, said, that the rules “will be effective from January 31, 2022 and it will be applicable to aircraft operators engaged in commercial operations, maintenance and repair organisations, flying training organisations and air navigation service providers”.In the order, the DGCA said under the scheme the operators have to ensure that at least 10 per cent of the employees are covered in a year while testing for drug abuse.While the aviation regulator already examines aviation personnel by breath analysers to check alcohol content in their bodies before commencing flight duties, a senior official said that the latest move is to ensure the safety of passengers and aircraft.“The worldwide spread of use of psychoactive substances, their general availability and the ever-increasing number of addicted users is a serious concern to aviation safety. Their use causes behavioural, cognitive and physiological changes. This manifests in dependence, major health related issues and negative effect on performance,” said the DGCA in the civil aviation requirement (CAR) order dated September 27, 2021.“The organisations must ensure that all employees have an equal chance of being tested each time the selection is made. Specific individuals or groups must not be targeted including certain locations,” said a senior official.“All the positive cases needed to be reported to the DGCA within 24 hours. If the screening test is non-negative, the employee will be immediately removed from the safety sensitive duty till a confirmatory report is received,” the DGCA said.“In case of a positive confirmatory test for the first time, the concerned employee will be referred to the de-addiction centre. In case a person, who has returned to safety sensitive duties after having been tested negative and is again found positive in the confirmatory test, license of such person will be suspended for a period of three years and for third positive occasion, the license will be cancelled,” the regulator said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dgca-asks-aviation-operators-to-conduct-random-dope-test-of-their-staff-from-january-31-316963
27-09-2021||Panaji||Former Goa CM Luizinho Faleiro resigns as Congress MLA, likely to join TMC||Former Goa chief minister and Congress leader Luizinho Faleiro resigned as member of the state Legislative Assembly on Monday and is likely to join the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC). Minutes before resigning, Faleiro praised West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC head Mamata Banerjee and said the country needs a leader like her to take on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Faleiro, who represented the Navelim Assembly seat and was recently made the Goa Congress's campaign committee chief in the wake of the state polls due next year, submitted his resignation to Assembly Speaker Rajesh Patnekar. With his resignation, the Congress's strength in the 40-member House has been reduced to four. The Congress had won 17 seats in the 2017 state Assembly elections, but later a number of MLAs resigned from the party. In July 2019, 10 MLAs quit the party and joined the ruling BJP. Shortly before resigning, Faleiro said the country needs a leader like Mamata Banerjee to counter Narendra Modi."I met certain leaders, they said yes, you are a Congressman, I am a Congressman for last 40 years, I will continue to be a Congressman and part of Congress family...," Faleiro told reporters at his private residence in Margao, about 30 km from Panaji."This family has to come together to fight Modi. Mamata is the one who has given a fight to Narendra Modi and his juggernaut," he said.He further said the "Mamata formula" has won in West Bengal."She has been able to stand up...she is a street-fighter," the 70-year-old leader said. Faleiro said Goa is also going through difficult times. "We need such fighters who have the same wavelength, ideology, principles and programmes. The country needs a leader like Mamata," he said."I am a Congressman, I would like a larger picture of all the Congress parties (which have split from the Congress) to come together and fight the next parliamentary election. I would do everything to achieve this dream. It is definitely my dream," he said. Amid rumours of him joining the TMC, Faleiro had on Sunday said he would make an "important announcement". TMC leader Derek O'Brien told PTI on Saturday in Goa that the party will be contesting the upcoming Assembly polls and they were in touch with several local leaders. He had said that the TMC will announce its chief ministerial candidate soon. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-goa-cm-luizinho-faleiro-resigns-as-congress-mla-likely-to-join-tmc-316961
27-09-2021||Ghaziabad (UP)||Forget a day’s inconvenience for farmers’ sake: Tikait urges people after Bharat Bandh ‘success’||The countrywide response to Monday’s Bharat Bandh has proved that the protests against three farm laws of the Centre are pan-India, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said and urged the people who faced inconvenience due to the shutdown to forget it for the farmers’ sake.He said people from not just three states (Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh) but across the country participated in the shutdown called by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions leading the protests against the three contentious laws, from 6 am to 4 pm and no violence was reported from anywhere.“Some people had described the protest as an issue of farmers only in three states (Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh). But the response and support to today’s bandh across the country has proved that it is a pan-India protest,” the national spokesperson of the BKU, part of the SKM, said.The 10-hour shutdown led to several trains being cancelled, highways and key roads blocked and thousands stranded for hours in parts of the country, particularly in the north.“Some people may have faced inconvenience due to the Bharat Bandh today, which is natural, but they should forget it for just one day in the name of farmers,” Tikait said in a statement.“The farmers have been on the roads, leaving their houses for the last 10 months, but the blind and deaf government neither sees nor hears anything,” he was quoted as saying in the statement issued by BKU media in-charge Dharmendra Malik.Tikait said in a democracy, there is no other option but to protest and warned the government that the farmers would go back to their homes only after the laws are abolished.“It is an appeal to our government that the problems of the farmers should be resolved as soon as possible,” he added.The influential BKU leader said the 10-month-long protests can end today if the government agrees to the farmers’ demands and urged the Centre to look into the issue at the earliest.He thanked farmers and workers across the country for making the shutdown a complete “success” and said the movement will continue till the three laws are repealed and a legal guarantee provided by the Centre on the Minimum Support Price (MSP) on crops.“The Bharat Bandh called by the SKM today has been a complete success. Farmers across the country came out on the roads and expressed their anger against the laws. At thousands of places, people came out in support of the bandh and staged demonstrations.“Besides farmers, labourers, traders, private workers, trade unions and political parties extended support to the bandh across the country,” Tikait said.He also hit out at the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh over the Rs 25 per quintal hike on the MSP for sugarcane announced last week and said a separate agitation would be carried out by the BKU over the issue in the coming days.Tikait is leading hundreds of anti-farm law protesters and BKU supporters at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border, one of the three key protest sites on the outskirts of the national capital, since November last year.

27-09-2021||New Delhi||SCBA reminds CJI: Elevate 13 'suitable' women lawyers found as HC judges||A day after Chief Justice of India NNV Ramana favoured 50 per cent representation of women in the judiciary, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on Monday reminded him of a list of 13 “suitable” lady lawyers shortlisted by its search committee for their appointment as high court judges."The CJI being the head of the institution and the appointments being done by the Collegium system, he can easily provide for more and more representation of women lawyers,” SCBA President Vikas Singh said in a statement.Singh said the SCBA was sure that “steps, if not already taken, would be taken immediately and as a first step the recommended names would be sent for consideration, especially the names of lady lawyers.”"Through several letters, we have been requesting for a meeting which has not been granted to us," the SCBA release said, adding it has received complaints from several lady lawyers regularly practicing before the top court that they were neither informed nor invited to the felicitation function on Sunday.Highlighting under-representation of women in the judiciary, CJI Ramana had on Sunday asked women lawyers to strongly demand 50 per cent reservation and assured them of his "total support" to address the problem of gender gap in the field of law.“Enough of suppression for 1000s of years. It’s high time we have 50 per cent representation for women in the judiciary. It’s your right. It’s not a matter of charity,” the CJI had said at a function organised by women lawyers of the Supreme Court to facilitate the nine newly appointed judges, including three women judges."I don't want you to cry but with anger, you have to shout and demand that we need 50 per cent reservation,” he had said.The CJI---during whose tenure four women judges, the maximum so far, are there in the Supreme Court---had said, “I am happy to have colleagues in the collegium who are progressive and determined to bridge the gap in the higher judiciary”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scba-reminds-cji-elevate-13-suitable-women-lawyers-found-as-hc-judges-316950
27-09-2021||Ghaziabad||Solution to farmers’ protest only through dialogue, not in courts: Rakesh Tikait||Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait on Monday said the solution to the ongoing farmers’ protest against the Centre’s three agri laws can be reached only through dialogue and not in the courts.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesperson was speaking during an online discussion hosted by the Bharatiya Chhatra Sansad (Indian Students Parliament), Pune, a non-political platform.Several trains were cancelled, highways and key roads blocked and many thousands stranded for hours on Monday as a nationwide 10-hour shutdown against the Centre’s three agri laws disrupted lives across parts of India, particularly in the north.Tikait said the 10-month-long protest, under the banner of Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), is to prevent ‘roti’ from becoming a market commodity, and privatisation of the agriculture sector.“I don’t know what is going to be the end of this protest but the movement has begun and the country’s youth, who often remained away from discussion on farming-related issues, is also joining it,” he said.In response to a query on the way forward, the BKU leader said, “The solution to the ongoing protests against the three agri laws of the Centre can be achieved only through dialogue and not in the courts of law.”He said the farmers’ stir is not only against the three laws and for legal guarantee on the minimum support price for crops but also against privatisation of agriculture.Referring to a leading multinational fast food chain, Tikait claimed, “When these stores close their work at the end of the day, they have plenty of unsold food which goes to the dustbins. There could be hungry staff or poor people outside their shops, but the unsold food goes to the dustbin only.”Hitting out at the BJP-led Centre, he alleged that the government has now “illegally” captured “several institutions” which the country has also understood now.Speaking at the session earlier in the day, BJP MLA and Deputy Speaker in the Assam Assembly Dr Numal Momin said the new laws are aimed at checking middlemen in the farming sector and benefitting both farmers and consumers.He said the growth of farmers was important for the country’s growth and some people opposed to the new laws now might realise their benefits eventually.“PM Modi brought these laws to end the middlemen from the farming system. Also, the benefits, which earlier went to middlemen, would be passed on to consumers,” Momin said.“It would take some time for some people to realise the benefits of these laws. Opposition to these laws is understandable. It’s a democracy and some people who have some objections on some points are opposing the laws,” he added.Hundreds of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s three border points—Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur—since November 2020 under the banner of SKM, demanding that the three contentious farm laws be repealed and a legal guarantee provided to them on MSP of crops.Tikait has been leading the charge with his supporters at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border.The Centre, which has held 11 rounds of formal dialogues with the farmers, has maintained that the new laws are pro-farmer.

27-09-2021||---||Filing PILs industry in itself, Centre tells HC on challenge to Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police Commissioner||New Delhi, September 27Filing public interest litigations (PILs) has become an industry and a career in itself, the Centre said in the Delhi High Court on Monday as it argued that the appointment of Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner deserved no intervention.“(They say) there are good officers. Who are they? Are they the persons who possibly felt aggrieved? PIL is an industry, a career by itself, which was not envisaged,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta argued before a bench headed by Chief Justice D N Patel which reserved its verdict on lawyer Sadre Alam’s PIL against Asthana’s appointment.Mehta, representing the Centre, stated that Asthana was appointed as Delhi Police Commissioner after following the due procedure, as applicable to the national capital, and a PIL could not be permitted to be a “forum for settling scores”.Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, representing Asthana, claimed before the bench, which also comprised Justice Jyoti Singh, that the petitioner was “a proxy for somebody who does not want to come in the front” and holds “personal vendetta”.“People are always aggrieved if some peer or someone in the same service is selected. But here there is no (such) challenge. They are people who are educated, at the pinnacle of their career,” he stated.Both Centre and Asthana objected to the intervention plea filed by Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), which has already moved the Supreme Court against the appointment.“Neither the petitioner nor the intervenor is entitled to be heard by the court because of the malafide conduct,” said senior lawyer Rohatgi.“The very fact that the same procedure was followed eight times and never questioned is ground enough to accept my submission that there is something other than public interest,” Mehta stated.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing CPIL, stated that Centre’s stand that it found no eligible officers in the Union Territory cadre for appointment as Delhi Commissioner was “astounding” and had a “demoralising effect”.He also claimed that the petition here was a copy-paste of the organisation’s plea before the top court.Lawyer B S Bagga, appearing for the petitioner, denied the allegation of mala fide and contended that Asthana’s appointment was in the teeth of the settled service law.In the petition, the petitioner has prayed for quashing of the July 27 order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs appointing Asthana as the Delhi Police Commissioner and also the order granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him.“The impugned orders (of MHA) are in clear and blatant breach of the directions passed by the Supreme Court of India in Prakash Singh case as respondent no.2 (Asthana) did not have a minimum residual tenure of six months; no UPSC panel was formed for appointment of Delhi Police Commissioner; and the criteria of having a minimum tenure of two years has been ignored,” the plea said.The Centre, in its affidavit, has said that the appointment of Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner was done in public interest, keeping in mind the diverse law and order challenges faced by the national capital, which have national security implications as well as international/cross border implications.Defending his appointment, the Centre said that it felt a “compelling need” to “appoint a person as a head of the police force of Delhi, who had diverse and vast experience of heading a large police force in a large State having diverse political as well as public order problem/ experience of working and supervising Central Investigating Agency as well as para-military forces”.It said his service tenure was also extended in public interest, in exercise of the powers vested in the cadre controlling authority and prayed that the petition be dismissed with exemplary costs.Asthana, in his affidavit, has told the court that there is a sustained social media campaign against him and the legal challenge to his appointment was an abuse of process of law, arising from vendetta.He said that ever since he was appointed Special Director, CBI, proceedings are being consistently filed against him by certain organisations as part of a “selective campaign”.The petition with similar prayers which has been filed by CPIL before the Supreme Court has urged to direct the central government to produce the July 27 order it issued, approving the inter-cadre deputation of Asthana from Gujarat cadre to AGMUT cadre.On August 25, the Supreme Court had asked the high court to decide within two weeks the plea pending before it against the appointment of the senior IPS officer as Delhi Police Commissioner. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/filing-pils-industry-in-itself-centre-tells-hc-on-challenge-to-asthanas-appointment-as-delhi-police-commissioner-316934

Huge quantity of unaccounted stock was also found in the factory premises of the companies,” the statement said.

Following this, he was apprehended from the Civil Lines area of the city, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Rajesh Deo said.The police officer claimed that during interrogation, Salman, a resident of Yamuna Vihar in Delhi’s North Ghonda area, disclosed that he was in a “state of aggression” over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) issues.On February 24 last year, people had gathered at Ghonda to protest these issues. When the mob became violent and started damaging properties, Salman joined them in setting fire to several shops and vehicles, the DCP claimed.Some people also fired at houses belonging to a particular community, Deo claimed.Salman was identified through statements of witnesses, video footage and disclosure statement of co-accused, police said.Communal clashes had broken out in north-east Delhi on February 24, 2020 after violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-wanted-in-2020-northeast-delhi-riots-cases-held-from-ups-bulandshahr-316932

The developments in Assam and Tripura resonate with the people of West Bengal.“The public issues raised by the Left parties with regard to Assam and Tripura wil alsol ring a bell with people of West Bengal politically,” a Left leader said, and added that developments in these three State also echoes in entire north-eastern States.The political hyphenation at the three States finds empirical evidence in BJP coming to power first in Assam and Tripura before mounting a serious bid to come to power in West Bengal in the last Assembly elections in the State.Although BJP got short-changed in its ultimate goal of dethroning ruling TMC in West Bengal, it emerged as principal Opposition in the Assembly, relegating the Left parties and the Congress to the margins in the process.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/squeezed-tightly-between-tmc-and-bjp-left-parties-jointly-embark-on-a-joint-strategy-in-west-bengal-316921

I am sorry we cannot support a gesture as thoughtless, as insensitive as this,” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera told reporters.Asked about the prime minister’s visit to the under-construction site of the new Parliament complex, the Congress leader asked whether he ever visited a hospital or an oxygen plant site.“I don’t know if the prime minister was seen visiting a hospital or an oxygen plant under construction. Three months ago, we were trying to save our loved ones and today our PM goes to visit the Rs 25,000 crore Central Vista project, the timing of which is questionable. The country is yet to recover from the pain, grief and sorrow that we went through,” he said.Modi on Sunday visited the construction site of the new Parliament building, which is expected to be completed in the second half of the next year.He also spoke to people involved in the construction as he inspected the ongoing work, official sources said.The building is part of the Central Vista project, which has faced criticism from the opposition.Government officials have said that Parliament’s Winter Session in 2022 will be held in the new building.The new Parliament building will have an area of 64,500 square metres. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pms-visit-to-central-vista-project-site-thoughtless-insensitive-gesture-congress-316917

27-09-2021||---||Complaints against Karni Sena chief, controversial Dasna priest transferred to Haryana, UP: Delhi Police to court||New Delhi, September 27Citing lack of jurisdiction, Delhi Police on Monday told a court here that it has transferred the complaints against Karni Sena Chief and Dasna Devi Temple Priest for their alleged communal remarks to police stations in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for “necessary legal action”.The police shifted the complaint to the police stations of the area where the alleged divisive remarks against Muslims were passed.This was stated in the action taken report (ATR) filed before Metropolitan Magistrate Rajat Goyal on a plea seeking FIR against Suraj Pal Amu and Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati.In a plea before the court, the complainant had stated that Amu allegedly made communally provocative and divisive remarks with the intention to outrage religious feelings at two Mahapanchayat held in Haryana in May and July.Whereas, Saraswati allegedly made provocative statements against the Muslim community at a press conference in Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh, and insulted Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia with an intention to outrage the religious feelings of Muslims studying in it, the complainant stated.Since Amu gave the alleged speech in Haryana, an Inspector of Delhi’s Jamia Nagar Police station told the court, “The complaint has been transferred to the concerned Police Stations of State: Haryana for necessary legal action at their end”.      Similarly, for Saraswati, the police said, “As in the complaint filed, it is clearly mentioned that the incident of passing communally provocative remarks happened in the jurisdiction area of Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh. Therefore, the complaint has been transferred to the concerned police station in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh for necessary legal action at their end.”                  The complainant, who did not wish to be named, had moved the court after the Jamia Nagar Police Station SHO refused to receive the copy of the complaint for registration of FIR against Amu and Saraswati.In a criminal complaint filed through advocates Sarim Naved, Kamran Javed, and Anshu Davar, the complainant who is a law teacher by profession said that the duo made remarks in an attempt to incite a riot and encourage vigilantism.The Karna Sena Chief was quoted in the complaint as saying, “Muslim brothers? What brothers? These bastards are butchers... Now you have the strength. Friends, we will have to strengthen our youth”.               While Saraswati had allegedly said that persons studying in certain educational institutions “cannot bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India or uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/complaints-against-karni-sena-chief-controversial-dasna-priest-transferred-to-haryana-up-delhi-police-to-court-316907

He was walking on the road through ankle-deep water when he accidentally fell in the under-construction trench and got washed away.A video of the man falling into the trench went viral on social media. A man, who was video recording the inundated road accidentally captured the shocking visual.Even 48 hours after the incident, the Disaster Response Force of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and special police parties of Cyberabad Commissionerate failed to locate the man. Search operations in nearby Neknampur lake also proved futile.Authorities were also using a drone as part of the search operation. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel have also been roped in. As many as 100 rescue workers were participating in the search. The man is suspected to have been swept away to Ibrahim Cheruvu or Musi lake.Rajinikanth was an employee of a company in Shadnagar town near Hyderabad.Municipal officials claimed that the area was barricaded and the work to lay the pipeline was delayed due to Ganesh Chaturthi.

27-09-2021||New Delhi||Rohini shootout: PIL in SC seeks directions to trial courts not to seek physical presence of accused routinely||Three days after three persons, including a gangster, were killed in a shootout at the Rohini court complex in the national capital, a Delhi-based lawyer on Monday moved the Supreme Court for directions to trial courts not to seek the physical presence of undertrials as a matter of routine.In his petition, advocate Rishi Malhotra contended that the presence of undertrial prisoners in courts not only endangered the safety of public and judicial officers but also provided an opportunity for hardcore criminals to escape from custody. Securing the presence of such prisoners through virtual attendance was a better option, he suggested.Noting that undertrial prisoners were produced from the jails to the trial court concerned every date of hearing, Malhotra said it “not only leads to unnecessary expenses on the State Exchequer but also more importantly endangers the public safety and the safety of the under trial concerned, especially in the cases of notorious gangsters and habitual criminals.”Pointing out that there were several provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure through which empowered the trial courts to dispense with the personal presence of undertrials during normal trial proceedings, he urged the top court to direct the trial courts not to routinely order presence of undertrial prisoners in court during proceedings unless needed.Meanwhile, the Delhi High Court has agreed to hear a plea seeking enhanced security in district courts in the national capital on September 29.Lawyer Richa Singh informed a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh that she has moved an application for early hearing in the petition pending since 2019, seeking better safety and security at the courts where incidents of crime have taken place.The application specifically mentions the Rohini Court complex incident.Counter affidavit was filed by the high court registry and loopholes on ground situation were pointed out, she added.“Your application will come for hearing on Wednesday,” said Chief Justice Patel.The application has sought an “urgent hearing” on account of the shootout inside a courtroom in Rohini court complex here on September 24, leaving three gangsters dead and a law intern injured.“The Writ Petition...will take quite considerable time to come up in its own normal turn for hearing before this Hon'ble court. Therefore, the interest of justice demands that the Writ Petition (Civil)... is listed and finally heard at an early time convenient to this Hon'ble court,” the application reads.The public interest litigation was filed by six law students and sought enhancement of security systems at the district courts in the national capital.The PIL highlighted several “crimes” that took place inside the court premises and stated that there has to be an atmosphere of dignity which could be achieved only when security lapses are attended to.In the counter affidavit filed in the case in September 2020, the high court registry had stated that steps were being actively taken and considered by the concerned committees of the district court with regards the safety and security at court premises.On September 24, Jailed gangster Jitendra Gogi and his two assailants posing as lawyers were killed inside the Rohini courtroom in a dramatic shootout that also saw the police fire bullets in retaliation, the officials said.Video footage of the incident showed policemen and lawyers rushing out in panic as gunshots rang out inside courtroom number 207.The two gunmen dressed as lawyers are suspected to be members of rival Tillu gang, an official said, adding that over 30 shots were fired.Witnesses said a law intern has also sustained bullet injury in her leg and some also claimed that the gang members pumped 10 bullets into Gogi, one of Delhi's most wanted criminals.Sources said Gogi received about seven bullet injuries, even as there was no official confirmation from police on this.Chief Justice of India N V Ramana has expressed deep concern over the shootout inside the crowded courtroom here and spoken to the Delhi High Court Chief Justice D N Patel in this regard, an apex court official had said. — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rohini-shootout-pil-in-sc-seeks-directions-to-trial-courts-not-to-seek-physical-presence-of-accused-routinely-316889
27-09-2021||New Delhi||Bharat Bandh against farm laws impacts life in pockets; roads and tracks blocked in some parts||Life in parts of India, particularly Haryana, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh, was disrupted on Monday as a nationwide shutdown against three agri laws got under way with protesters blocking highways and key roads, and squatting on railway tracks in some places.Also read: Farmers block roads at various places in Punjab, HaryanaFarmers block Chandigarh-Ambala road, Mohali airport road at 5 places25 trains affected due to Bharat Bandh: RailwaysThe Bharat Bandh, called by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 40 farm unions, marks one year since President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the three controversial laws and 10 months since thousands of farmers set up camp at Delhi's border points to voice their protest.The bandh is in effect from 6 am to 4 pm.Though much of the country was unaffected, commuters in north India felt the pinch with trains being cancelled or delayed and massive traffic snarls that prevented cross-border movement. This particularly impacted the Delhi-NCR region, including the satellite towns of Gurugram, Ghaziabad and Noida, with many thousands crossing borders each day to go to work or study.Public transport was hit in Kerala where the strike is supported by the ruling LDF and the opposition Congress-led UDF. KSRTC bus services were off the road with almost all trade unions in the state taking part. People who had to travel opted for private modes of transport while others stayed home.Union leaders, including INTUC state president R Chandrasekharan, had said the shutdown would be peaceful and there would be no blocking of vehicles or forced shutting down of shops.Protests were also seen in West Bengal where the Left Front backed the call for a shutdown. Images from Kolkata showed protesters swarming a section of a railway track. Similar images came in from West Midnapore with Left Front supporters blocking the IIT Kharagpur-Hijri railway line.In the national capital, autorickshaws and taxis plied normally and shops were open with unions and associations extending only "in-principle support" to the Bharat Bandh called by farmers.However, there was chaos at the city's borders, including at Ghazipur in western Uttar Pradesh where farmers blocked the highway to prevent any movement of vehicles. Not far away in Sonepat in Haryana, some farmers squatted on tracks. In nearby Patiala in Punjab, too, members of the BKU-Ugrahan sat on the tracks to register their protest.Punjab saw a complete shutdown in many places, including Moga, where farmers blocked the Moga-Ferozepur and Moga-Ludhiana national highways. Farmer leaders from Punjab have, in many ways, spearheaded the year-long protest.Down south, in Karnataka, the shutdown did not have any major impact in the initial few hours with all business and establishments functioning normally and transport services available. However, farmers' attempts to organise a 'Rasta Roko' at major national and state highways led to disruption in vehicular movement in several parts of the state, especially in the capital Bengaluru.In Guwahati, activists of the Socialist Unity Centre of India took out a protest march.All emergency establishments and essential services, including hospitals, medical stores, relief and rescue work and people attending to personal emergencies have been exempted from the strike.Many non-NDA parties have extended support to the nationwide 10-hour strike. These include the Aam Aadmi Party, Samajwadi Party, Telugu Desam Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Left parties and Swaraj India. The YSR Congress government in Andhra Pradesh has also announced support to the Bharat Bandh.The SKM on Sunday had appealed for complete peace during the bandh and urged all Indians to join the strike.“It is a day to express support to the annadatas (farmers) of the country, the ones who keep all Indians alive,” it said in a statement.

27-09-2021||New Delhi||Bharat Bandh: Rahul Gandhi voices support for farmers, slams govt as ‘exploitative’||Expressing support for protesting farmers, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday said the farmers’ non-violent ‘satyagraha’ is still resolute but the “exploitative” government does not like this and that is why a ‘Bharat Bandh’ has been called.The Congress has asked its workers, state unit chiefs and heads of frontal organisations to take part in the ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by farmer unions to protest against the Centre’s three agri laws.Many non-NDA parties have extended support to the nationwide 10-hour strike on Monday called by farmers protesting against the three agri laws under the aegis of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM).Posting rhyming lines in Hindi on Twitter, Gandhi said, “Kisano ka ahimsak satyagraha aaj bhi akhand hai, lekin shoshankar sarkar ko ye nahi pasand hai, isliye aaj Bharat Bandh hai (Farmers’ non-violent satyagraha is resolute even today, but the exploitative government does not like this and that’s why it is Bharat Bandh today).”      Gandhi used the hashtag ‘IStandWithFarmers’ with his tweet.The SKM on Sunday had appealed for complete peace during the Bandh and urged all Indians to join the strike.The government and farmer unions have held 11 rounds of talks so far, the last being on January 22, to break the deadlock and end the farmers’ protest.Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26.The three laws—The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- were passed by Parliament in September last year.Farmer groups have alleged that these laws will end the ‘mandi’ and the MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced and asserted that these steps will help increase farmers’ income.

They werestopping and checking each and every vehicle passing through these lanes.The pictures and videos of the traffic jam went viral on social media and it was then that the congestion was cleared though cops from Delhi as well Gurugram stood guard at border.Bharat Bandh: Farmers block roads at various places in Punjab, HaryanaBharat Bandh: Farmers block Chandigarh-Ambala road, Mohali airport road at 5 places“The cars were virtually crawling bumper to bumper 8.30 am and 9.30 am. The situation worsened as farmers blocked traffic movement in Rewari and traffic was diverted to Bilaspur, Pachgaon and KMP,” said a cop posted at border.According to Ravinder Tomar, deputy commissioner of police, though the traffic movement was slow owing to checking by Delhi police, Gurugram cops managed to keep things moving and it was cleared within an hour.“This is not new. We have a waiting time at this border of around 15 to 20 minutes every day. It’s the ongoing construction of underpass and the regular barricading by Delhi police which lead to traffic congestion every day during office hours. Today, I had to wait for an hour as majority of lanes were closed due to protest. With a great difficulty I had managed to get an appointment at AIIMS for my son butmissed it because of this now the next appointment available is after one month.

The article examines taboos around menstrual health. It is now fully reproduced in The Lancet’s September edition and has a pointer on the front page.A range of readers reacted to the term with writer Susan Dalgety saying, “Are we just supposed to accept this? Are we extremists for objecting to women and girls being dehumanised?” For Women Scotland, a group of women from across Scotland working on girls’ and children’s rights, said, “It is the language of the serial killers”.The group asked The Lancet if it would speak of men in similar terms. Stephanie de Giorgio, working on women’s health, twitted: “You cannot write that and then talk about menstrual shame in the same sentence.”A section of reproductive rights activists termed the use of the expression “a new low”, while others said it amounted to “medical misogyny”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/the-lancet-under-fire-for-dehumanising-women-316657

Whether the move will help soothe those believed upset remains to be seen as rival SP, BSP and Congress too have been wooing the Brahmins, who comprise about 13 per cent of the total voters in UP and hold sway among other castes as well.Opinion page: BJP on a communal trajectory in UPPolarisation at work in UPThe other ministers are from the OBC and SC/ST community.

He said the interest on outstanding electricity bills would be waived while 119 sugar mills would be operated and linked with ethanol.At the September 5 ‘Kisan mahapanchayat’ in Muzaffarnagar, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait had targeted the Adityanath government over “low” sugarcane prices.

To address these challenges, we need not just more, but bigger banks.” The Union Minister said during the keynote address at the 74th annual general meeting of the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) in Mumbai on Sunday.Must go digitalLong-term future of Indian banking is going to be largely driven by digitised processes. —Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance ministerThe Finance Minister exhorted the industry to visualise the shape of Indian banking in the immediate and long-term future. “If we look at the post-Covid scenario, India’s banking contours will have to be very unique, where there has been an extremely successful adoption of digitisation. While banks in many countries could not reach out to their clients during the pandemic, the level of digitisation of Indian banks helped us to transfer money to small, medium and big account-holders through the DBT and digital mechanisms.” The Finance Minister underlined the importance of seamless and interconnected digital systems in creating a sustainable future for Indian banking industry. At the same time, the Finance Minister observed that there were wide disparities as well in access to financial services.“Almost two-thirds of nearly 7.5 lakh panchayats have optical fibre connection. The IBA should consider this and conduct an exercise and decide where banks should have a physical presence and where we are able to serve customers, even without a physical branch. The IBA should take the initiative and complement government’s efforts for financial inclusion and enhancing access to financial services, especially in unserved and under-served areas,” she suggested. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/need-more-sbi-like-banks-says-nirmala-sitharaman-316549

There is no call for ‘Bharat Bandh’ in Delhi, but we are watching the developments and adequate number of personnel will be on ground,” another officer said.A police officer from Outer district said no protester will be allowed and extra forces had been already deployed in the district ever since farmers had been on a sit-in at Delhi’s Tikri border.“But all roads connecting Delhi through villages near border areas will be strictly checked. All vehicles will be thoroughly checked at the pickets.” The SKM had also asked political parties to “stand with farmers in their quest to defend principles of democracy and federalism”.“As this historic struggle completes ten months, SKM has called Monday (September 27) to be observed as ‘Bharat Bandh’ against the anti-farmer Modi government.“The SKM appeals to every Indian to join this nationwide movement and make the ‘Bharat Bandh’ a resounding success. In particular, we appeal to all organisations of workers, traders, transporters, businessmen, students, youth and women and all social movements to extend solidarity with the farmers that day,” the SKM had recently said in a statement.The bandh will be held from 6 am to 4 pm during which all government and private offices, educational and other institutions, shops, industries and commercial establishments as well as public events and functions will be closed throughout the country, it had said.All emergency establishments and essential services, including hospitals, medical stores, relief and rescue work and people attending to personal emergencies, will be exempted.Farmers from different parts of the country, especially Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at Delhi borders since November last year, demanding the repeal of the three contentious farm laws that they fear would do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.The government, however, has been projecting the three laws as major agricultural reforms. Over 10 rounds of talks between the two parties have failed to break the deadlock.

Your success stories will make them more impulsive and we expect more women will join the profession and we will achieve the goal of 50 per cent shortly. I wholeheartedly support all initiatives taken by you and so long as I am here I will support all of your causes,” he said.The Chief Justice of India said that he believes in mixing with people, knowing about their ideas so that he understands what problem the society is facing, but added these days he is visiting lots of places and has got bored of giving speeches.“After coming back yesterday night from Odisha, I collected some information about the system in which we are working. In the entire country...in subordinate judiciary less than 30 per cent are women, in high courts women judges are 11.5 per cent and in Supreme Court four women judges out of 33...(that is) 11 or 12 per cent,” the CJI said.He said that out of 1.7 million advocates in the country only 15 per cent are women and only two per cent elected representatives in the state bar councils are women.“The other day I have told Bar Council of India chairman Manan Kumar Mishra, what is this in your bar council national committee you don’t have any single woman member represented, this needs urgent correction,” he said.CJI Ramana further said that people will often say easily that it is difficult to have 50 per cent reservation because women have a lot of problems but that’s not correct.“I do agree that there is an uncomfortable environment, lack of infrastructure, crowded courtrooms, lack of washrooms, lack of creches and lack of sitting places, which are some of the major issues which are unfriendly to the women lawyers in the system,” he said.He said that after gathering information about the prevailing conditions throughout the country he is proposing for Judicial Infrastructure Corporation, which is the need of the hour.“In 6,000 courts across the country, 22 per cent of them do not have separate toilets (for women) and even lady officers also have to suffer from this,” the CJI said, adding, “So these are the ground realities which we have to tackle immediately and that is the reason why I am proposing certain issues to the executive to take and correct this.”      With regard to lawyers’ demand for opening of the top court for physical hearings which has been held virtually since the outset of the pandemic, the CJI said that hopefully after Dussehra vacation it may resume. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/you-have-to-shout-with-anger-and-demand-50-per-cent-reservation-in-judiciary-cji-to-women-lawyers-316504

The date of reopening has been postponed many times.Welcoming the decision, India’s High Commissioner to Canada Ajay Bisaria described it as a “decisive step towards normalising air mobility” between the two nations.“@airindiain and @AirCanada are now set to run daily flights between Delhi and Toronto/Vancouver from 27 September. Working with Canadian partners to further ease travel,” he tweeted. Passengers who travel from India to Canada via an indirect route still need to provide a pre-departure negative Covid-19 molecular test result from a third country before continuing their journey to Canada. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/canada-lifts-ban-on-direct-flights-from-india-316497
27-09-2021||---||UP CM Yogi Adityanath expands Cabinet to balance caste equations; Jitin Prasada sworn in||Vibha SharmaTribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 26Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday effected the much anticipated expansion of his council, including seven new ministers representing “under-represented castes”, to balance the crucial caste balance in the key state ahead of assembly elections next year.The new ministers include former Congress leader from the Brahmin community, Jitin Prasada, whose entry is expected to help reset perceptions that the BJP government led by Adityanth, who is a Thakur himself, is pro-Thakur.Prasada, a former Union minister in the Congress government in the Centre, was sworn in the Cabinet rank. However, it remains to be seen whether the move will help satisfy the Brahmins, who are believed to be upset with Adityanath. Rival parties, including the SP, the BSP and the Congress, are trying to win the upper caste community that makes up around 13 per cent of UP’s voters and influence a sizable chunk in other castes as well.Meanwhile, the new ministers sworn in the council of CM Yogi Adityanath ahead of key assembly elections next year include members of OBCs and SC/ST community.They are Chhatrapal Singh Gangwar (Baheri MLA),  Palturam (Balrampur MLA), Sangeeta Balwant Bind (Gazipur Sadar MLA), Sanjeev Kumar, (Sonbhadra MLA), Dinesh Khatik (Hastinapur MLA) and Dharamvir Singh Prajapati (MLC Agra mandal) .The list did not include high-profile former bureaucrat AK Sharma, believed to be close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-cm-yogi-adityanath-expands-cabinet-to-balance-caste-equations-jitin-prasada-sworn-in-316484
27-09-2021||Beijing||Don’t shift goalposts, confuse border management with resolving boundary question: Indian envoy to China||India has told China not to “shift goalposts” and “confuse” managing the border affairs and restoring peace at the frontiers with the larger issue of the resolution of the boundary question, which is dealt with by different designated mechanisms.After the standoff erupted in eastern Ladakh in May last year, India has consistently maintained that peace and tranquillity in the border areas are essential for the overall development of relations between the two countries. Besides being neighbours, India and China are also large and emerging economies and “it is not unusual to have differences and problems”, Indian envoy to China Vikram Misri said while addressing the 4th High-level Track II Dialogue on China-India Relations held on September 23.“The key question is how to deal with them and ensure that outcomes are informed by reasonableness, maturity and respect for the maintenance of peace and tranquillity along our frontiers,” Misri said.The meeting held virtually was co-hosted by the School of International Studies of Sichuan University (SCU), China Centre for South Asian Studies and Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA) in which several former envoys and scholars took part.Besides Misri, China’s Ambassador to India Sun Weidong also participated in the meeting. Referring to “multi-faceted dialogue” held by the two countries since last year including several rounds of talks between the top military officials on both sides and the meetings between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi to resolve the military standoff in Eastern Ladakh, Misri said: “These contacts have resulted in significant progress on the ground”.“Following disengagement in the Galwan Valley in July last year, the two sides have been able to disengage from the North and South Banks of the Pangong Lake in February 2021, and most recently from Gogra in August 2021,” he said.“The conversation between the two sides continues regarding the remaining locations and we hope that disengagement at the remaining friction areas will enable us to reach a point where we can pick up the threads of bilateral cooperation,” he said.“The experience of this multi-faceted dialogue over the last year and a half leads me to believe that we are well-equipped when it comes to resolving pressing issues in the bilateral relationship,” he said.“Our leaders have in the past concurred that we must work out issues peacefully, prevent differences from turning into disputes and, most importantly, preserve peace and tranquillity in our border areas,” he said.“The recent experience also suggests that at the ground level, when managing a difficult bilateral situation, finding a resolution hinges on mature minds, open channels, and consistency between words and actions. But while these are positive elements we can draw on, we must steer clear of certain obstacles which could block progress,” he said.“The first is to avoid shifting goalposts. For long, the Indian and Chinese sides have adhered to a well-understood distinction between resolving the boundary question and managing border affairs,” he said.“The 1988 understanding between our leaders was precisely for keeping the resolution of the boundary question on a track separate yet parallel to the bilateral relationship, with the maintenance of peace and tranquillity as the prerequisite,” he said.The Special Representatives mechanism, the Agreement on Political Parameters and Guiding Principles of 2005 and the three-phase framework were all designed to work on the boundary question, “which we agreed was a complex and sensitive issue requiring time to work through,” Misri said.“This is the root cause of the tense situation along the borders. We advocate that we should address the boundary issue through peaceful negotiations and we don’t think that the border issue should be linked up to our bilateral ties,” he said.But at the same for managing border affairs on a daily basis, the two countries had evolved a mechanism, “consisting of instruments such as the WMCC (Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs) and a succession of agreements, protocols and CBMs, in order to govern behaviour on the ground and ensure peace and tranquillity”.“A serious violation of peace and tranquillity in the border areas naturally requires us to apply our minds on the basis of established agreements, protocols and mechanisms to resolve it. As we do so, any attempt to confuse border affairs with the Boundary Question is a disservice to the work of those involved in finding solutions,” he said.This is why the Indian side has been consistently saying that the current issue is about restoring peace and tranquillity to the border areas and is not about the resolution of the larger Boundary Question, on which India’s stance has not changed, despite what happened last year, he said.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km Line of Actual Control (LAC).China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet, which is firmly rejected by India.Misri also said China should not take a one-sided view of mutual concerns and sensitivities.“The second obstacle is to take a one-sided view of concerns and sensitivities, where one’s own preoccupations trump any of those flagged by the other side,” he said.“As EAM (External Affairs Minister) Dr S Jaishankar has stated, India-China relations must proceed on the basis of the three mutuals – mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests”, he said.“In an international community where we interact as equals, and as important major neighbours of each other, it cannot be that only one side’s concerns are of relevance while the other side’s case goes unheard,” he said.Safeguarding territorial integrity and national security holds equal value for both sides. Affixing blame exclusively on the other side is not a helpful approach, he said.“And to press one’s own concerns and disregard the other side’s concerns and sensitivities without any explanation or recourse goes beyond disrespect. It actually creates even more obstacles to finding solutions,” he added.“The third obstacle is viewing bilateral relations through the prism of relations with other countries. We are two ancient civilisations and two modern Asian nations who have evolved their own independent foreign policies and cherish their own strategic autonomy,” he said.“For India’s part, I would say that a policy approach that came into its own over six decades ago, continues to be relevant today. India formulates its national and foreign policies on the basis of national interest first and foremost,” Misri said.“We believe in multilateralism but we are also convinced that it needs to be reformed in order to better deliver its fruits to all stakeholders”, he said.Both countries engaged in key global dialogues while simultaneously pursuing their objectives in several smaller forums whose members have shared interests, he said.“Many of these forums include China – the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation), BRICS (Brazil Russia, India, China, South Africa) and RIC (Russia, India, China) are some examples of this and these dialogues have continued even during the difficult phase that our bilateral relationship is passing through,” Misri said.“India-China relations, therefore, must be judged and managed on their own merits. They are substantial enough and sufficiently complex that they require their own approach and appropriate handling, without imaginary third factors complicating them further and distracting us from working on our priorities,” he said.The two nations must focus on the actual issues that face them, and employ a “sensitive and constructive problem-solving approach” while bearing in mind each other’s essential autonomy of decision-making, he said.“Addressing and processing differences properly means confronting them head-on and not sweeping them under the carpet. This approach will enable us to do what is necessary to bring relations to a healthier track,” he said.“I remain convinced that we can resolve our current difficulties without the outcome necessarily appearing to be a win or loss for either side. A win-win solution for both India and China is very much possible and we remain committed to pursuing it,” he said.

27-09-2021||New Delhi||Mann ki Baat: On World River Day, PM Modi stresses importance of river rejuvenation, cleanliness||Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his monthly “Mann Ki Baat” programme on Sunday reinforced the significance of rivers on World Rivers Day and said they are organically related to India’s ancient heritage and culture.He also stressed the importance of conservation and harvesting of rainwater, and the cleanliness drive which he said should not flame down.He emphasised the success the country achieved during the ‘Swachhta Abhiyan” through collective efforts and pitched for the continuation of the momentum.He also referred to the teachings and practices of Mahatma Gandhi with regard to cleanliness, saying he linked it with the independence struggle to raise mass awakening regarding it.Dwelling on the importance of rivers on World Rivers Day, which is celebrated today, Modi said: “River is not merely a physical entity. It does not consume its own water but provides it for others. That is why it is lionised as Mother.”Also, rivers reinvigorate national spirit and national unity, he claimed.He made a mention of the ‘Namami Gange’, or Clean Ganga, project—a pet project of the prime minister’s that was launched in 2014— and said it had become a peoples’ movement. He said the articles donated to him are auctioned, and the proceeds are contributed to the programme.He expanded the concept of cleanliness drive by linking it to transparency and corruption-free practices in governance and public dealings.He also spoke about the digital push that his government had given. He said digital practices have ensured that money reaches directly to the targeted beneficiaries. Digital transactions have ensured this, he said, and also referred to Rs 6 lakh crore payments made through UPI.In August there were transactions worth more than Rs 350 crore through UPI, he said, and then lauded the Fin-Tech platform in this regard.Siachen expeditionModi noted the hoisting of Indian Tricolour on “Kumar Post” —the highest peak point of Siachen Glacier—by an eight-member expedition team of Divyangjan (physically challenged). He named the members of the team including Ajay Kumar (Haryana) and Irfan Ahmad Mir (Jammu and Kashmir).“They demonstrated can-do spirit,” Modi said and called their feat "inspirational".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mann-ki-baat-on-world-river-day-pm-modi-stresses-importance-of-river-rejuvenation-cleanliness-316460
27-09-2021||Kolkata||Prashant Kishor enrolls himself as voter from Mamata’s Bhabanipur constituency; triggers controversy||In an interesting development, the poll strategist Prashant Kishor, who helped Trinamool Congress to win in the recent Assembly polls, has registered himself as a voter of the Bhabanipur Assembly constituency. The election commission website claims that Kishor has registered himself in the period between January and April fuelling the speculation that he might join the party.The inclusion of Kishor before the bye-election in the Bhabanipur Assembly constituency, where Mamata Banerjee is contesting to retain her post as the chief minister of the state, triggered controversy. Taking a jibe at the ruling Trinamool Congress, the BJP on Saturday said Prashant Kishor, who was the poll adviser of the Mamata Banerjee-led party in the recent West Bengal elections, can be called a “bohiragato” being enrolled as a voter in the Bhabanipur constituency.Claiming that PK (poll strategist Prashant Kishor) is in the list, who is the founder of I-PAC, BJP media cell in-charge Saptarshi Choudhury tweeted in Bengali, “At last Prashant Kishor becomes the voter of Bhabanipur. So, we are not sure if the daughter of Bengal is now in favour of a bahiragato (outsider) voter.” Kishore with an EPIC number of IUI0686683 has been shown as a permanent resident of Bhabanipur Assembly constituency and has the polling station at Booth No- 222 in Rani Shankari Lane under the constituency.Kishor, credited with the spectacular victory of the Trinamool Congress against a high voltage Assembly poll campaign by the BJP, had announced he will be taking a break from strategising work.He was not seen publicly in Trinamool’s campaign for Bhabanipur since the announcement of poll dates, but sources said he had held meetings with party national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee recently in Delhi.Kishor’s I-PAC team members had also visited Tripura, which the Trinamool is eyeing in the 2023 polls, but were allegedly confined in a hotel by the BJP government in the state for three days under the Disaster Management Act.Kishor’s inclusion in Bhabanipur voters’ list has virtually ended the speculation of his joining the Congress. Kishor was meeting Congress’ top leadership, including Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi for the last few months fuelling the speculation that he might join Congress. Sources in the party had also indicated that the decision of his’ joining the party was lying with Congress President Sonia Gandhi.Kishor had initially worked with the BJP in the run-up to 2014 Lok Sabha elections and thereafter joined the JD(U) and was the party’s national president. However, he was expelled from the party for his anti-party activities and allegedly using the party platform for his selfish personal purposes.Kishor also worked with the Congress during the last Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh. He also assisted the party in Punjab and was Chief Minister Amarinder Singh’s adviser, a post he quit recently.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prashant-kishor-enrolls-himself-as-voter-from-mamatas-bhabanipur-constituency-triggers-controversy-316452
