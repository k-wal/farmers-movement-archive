19-09-2021||Panaji||BJP, Cong replaced their CMs out of fear of Kejriwal model: AAP||The fear of the Arvind Kejriwal “model” prompted Congress and BJP to replace their chief ministers in some states, where Assembly elections are due early next year, an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) functionary said here on Sunday.The comments of Goa AAP convener Rahul Mhambre came against the backdrop of the BJP replacing its chief minister Vijay Rupani in Gujarat last week and Congress appointing Charanjit Singh Channi as the new CM of Punjab on Sunday after incumbent Amarinder Singh resigned a day before following a bitter power tussle.He said AAP national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will arrive in Goa, where Assembly polls are due in February next year, on September 20.“BJP and Congress replaced their chief ministers in some states due to the fear of the Kejriwal model,” Mhambre said.Kejriwal had announced that the AAP will provide up to 300 units of free electricity if voted to power in Goa during his earlier visit. He had also assured 24x7 uninterrupted electricity supply, Mhambre said.Mhambre said Kejriwal’s pre-election promises had forced Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant to announce schemes promising free water supply for people and doorstep services “which he blatantly copied from the Aam Aadmi Party”.

19-09-2021||Puri||Treasure hunt at Emar Mutt in Jagannath Temple for lost hoard||A treasure hunt has started at the Emar Mutt (Monastry), located in the southeastern corner of the 12th Jagannath Mandir, with teams of archaeologists armed with metal detectors searching for a lost hoard.The search started on Thursday is being carried out following a request by the Narayan Ramanuj Das, the Mahant (head) of Uttarparshwa Mutt, who is in charge of Emar Mutt. The Mutt authorities as well as historians suspect that a hoard of valuables is buried inside the premises. The belief that a stash is buried underground comes from discoveries of two earlier troves. In 2011, the police had stumbled on a treasure trove of 522 silver ingots weighing 18 tonnes inside the Mutt worth about Rs 90 crore. Earlier in April this year 45 more silver ingots weighing about 35 kg each were found inside the Mutt. Apart from silver ingots, a silver tree and silver flowers, about 16 antique swords, and a bronze cow sculpture were also recovered from the Mutt, stablished by Ramanujacharya in 1050 when he came to Puri.A special team of the State Archaeology Department in presence of officials of Shree Jagannath Temple Administration (SJTA), Puri district collector Samarth Verma, Puri SP KV Singh and trust member of the Emar Mutt, began the search inside the premises of the Emar Mutt in the pilgrim town on Thursday to trace hidden valuables.Puri Sub-Collector, Bhabataran Sahu said: “As of now, no material was detected during Thursday’s inspection. We will take appropriate action on the report of the technical team which scanned the premises.” The treasures recovered earlier from the mutt are now kept in the state treasury in Puri and guarded by armed police. As many as 18 mutts belonging to Ramanuja sect was established in Puri by Ramanujacharya. All these mutts are closely linked to the Shree Jagannath Temple and are involved in rituals associated with the Temple.Govindacharya or Govinda Jeeyar was the first pontiff of this Mutt. Govindacharya was given the name Emperumannar, which means “My Lord” in Tamil. However, a section of disciples opposed the name and finally changed this to “Emar”. Govindacharya was Ramanujacharya’s cousin brother. The Mutt worships Lord Rama, Lady Sita and Lord Laxman.The mutt’s hidden treasury,  came to the limelight ten years back when two masons involved in its renovation work were caught by Dhenkanal Police while they were trying to dispose of two silver ingots weighing over 30 kg each. During the interrogation of the duo confessed having stolen the valuables from Emar Mutt.This confession led to the discovery of a room stashed with silver ingots.Former Emar Mutt Mahant Rajgopal Das had claimed ownership over the property and filed a case in the High Court seeking direction to the police to hand it over. The ingots were then shifted from Emar Mutt to the district armory inside the Police Reserve.The Commissioner of Endowments, Odisha had constituted a trust to manage the affairs of the mutt. Since Das did not cooperate with the trust body, the administration forcefully entered the mutt and he was stripped of all his powers.A four-member trust body headed by Narayan Ramanuj Das, who is the current mahant of Utter Parsva Mutt, had taken over  Emar Mutt on Friday, and the inventory of all the valuables was made in the presence of a magistrate.Speaking to PTI, Narayan Ramanuja Das said “The Thursday’s metal detector search has indicated some thing. But, we cannot say whether they are valuable metals or iron or some other metal. As metal detectors could detect materials up to just 1.5 feet to 2 feet under the earth, we now need a better survey” which could detect metals at a greater depth.However, Das expressed ignorance regarding a rumoured store of gold and diamonds in the Mutt. “How can I make such claims? We have seen silver ingots so far. Who knows whether there is gold or diamond hidden in the Mutt,” he said. About the existence of such huge volume of silver ingots in Emar Mutt, historian   Anil Dhir, archeologist specialising in the state’s history said “my research on the Great Orissa Famine of 1866 (Na’Anka Durbhikshya), I had got conclusive evidence that the silver ingot was part of the payment made by the British authorities to various Mutts for rice purchased from them during  famine years.” The Emar Mutt was among the biggest landowners of the period and had overflowing granaries, he said adding that when the British administration wanted to buy the stocks for relief kitchens, the Mutt heads had demanded payment in bullion. “I have found various documents which confirm that the Mutts were selling a major part of their stocks for the relief kitchens that had been set up by the authorities. This treasure is the legitimate property of the Mutt,” Dhir claimed while speaking to PTI.He also claimed that the Emar Mutt was the fountainhead of many smaller Mutts. Among branches in different places, the Emar Mutts at Sakhigopal and the Old Town of Bhubaneswar stand apart due to their historical importance. “There should be proper surveys in both these places for buried treasures. There is every chance that silver ingots may also be buried in Sakhigopal and Bhubaneswar mutt,” Dhir said. Meanwhile, the Emar Mutt in Puri including the famed Raghunandan Library, spread over five acre of land, has been demolished as part of the beautification drive of the pilgrim town. “We have been left with structures like sanctum sanctum of the Mutt and 10 rooms after demolition. There were 200 rooms in the mutt premises earlier. Many shops constructed on the Mutt property are encroached and there is no such source of income to run the daily affairs. We urge the government to restore mutt property,” Das, the Mutt chief said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/treasure-hunt-at-emar-mutt-in-jagannath-temple-for-lost-hoard-313388

Later, the police got clues that the accused was trying to cross into Maharashtra and go abroad, but was caught in Mumbai, the officer said.He said the police team would be seeking court permission on Monday to take custody of the accused for interrogation and evidence.He said the team was trying to complete the investigation at the earliest and file a charge sheet as soon as possible.According to the police, the accused had sent inappropriate messages to the girl, a class eight student, through social media. Her parents came across the messages and warned the girl, the police had said.Her father brought the issue to the notice of the school management, too, and it in turn took up the matter with the teacher, the police had said.“The messages were improper for a teacher to send to a 12-year-old student. The girl was suspected to have ended the life out of mental tension as her parents read the messages,” the police had said, adding that they could arrive at a conclusion only after a detailed probe.The victim’s father had earlier told the media that his daughter ended her life following mental harassment by the teacher. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-police-nab-teacher-in-mumbai-for-allegedly-driving-girl-student-to-suicide-313385

19-09-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Kejriwal promises unemployment allowance, job quota for local people if voted to power||AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday promised to take big steps to end migration from Uttarakhand, assuring an unemployment allowance and an 80 per cent job quota for people of the state if his party comes to power in the next assembly elections.Making six promises, Kejriwal said every youth of Uttarakhand would get employment if the AAP is voted to power, and assured a monthly allowance of Rs 5,000 to an individual from every family till they got a job.He also promised to reserve 80 per cent of both private and government jobs for the people of the state and to create one lakh employment opportunities within six months of coming to power.A job portal, on the lines of the one in Delhi, will be launched which will provide an interactive platform to job seekers and employers, Kejriwal said, addressing a press conference in Haldwani.A separate ministry will also be created to address the issues of unemployment and migration, the Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convenor added.Kejriwal also accused successive governments of doing nothing but looting Uttarakhand's resources for years.If voted to power, the AAP will take big steps for large-scale creation of jobs and prevention of migration from the hills, he said.Referring to his earlier promises of free electricity to farmers round the clock and 300 units of power to every household at no cost, Kejriwal said all these are meant to be fulfilled."Unlike others, we do what we say. We are going to keep all our promises. If we say we will give free power to farmers 24x7 or give 300 units of power for free, we mean it. We have done it in Delhi, and we will do it here," he added.He asserted that all of what he has said can be done and the only thing needed is good intention."Successive governments in Uttarakhand have been devoid of good intentions and have only looted its resources," Kejriwal alleged."When we came to power in Delhi in 2015, we were asked from where would we bring the money that was needed to keep the commitments we had made to people. But we turned a deficit budget into one of profit within four years. All we did was wipe out corruption and everything else followed," he said.Kejriwal said the AAP has run Delhi and it will bring that experience to serve the people of Uttarakhand.Seventy-three per cent of people in Delhi are getting free electricity, he said, adding that the Delhi model of development will be adopted in Uttarakhand.Giving an example of how the Delhi government was saving money on every development project, he said a bridge estimated to be built at a cost of Rs 325 crore was built in Rs 200 crore only.Given an opportunity, the AAP will help the people of Uttarakhand overcome the misery of 21 years in just 21 months.If people want all this to happen, they must give AAP's chief ministerial candidate Col Ajay Kothiyal a chance, Kejriwal added.

19-09-2021||New Delhi||With eye on UP polls, labour codes unlikely to be implemented this fiscal||The four labour codes are unlikely to be implemented this fiscal in view of slow progress on the drafting of rules by the states and also for political reasons like elections in Uttar Pradesh, a source said.The implementation of these laws assumes significance because once these are implemented there would be reduction in take-home pay of employees and firms have to bear higher provident fund liability. "The Ministry of Labour is ready with the rules under the four labour codes. But the states have been slow in drafting and finalising those under new codes. Besides, the government is not keen to implement the four codes due to political reasons, which are mainly elections in Uttar Pradesh (due in February 2022 onwards)," the source said.The four codes have been passed by Parliament. But for implementation of these codes, rules under these must be notified by central as well as state governments for enforcing those in respective jurisdictions. "It is likely that the implementation of the four labour codes may be dragged beyond this fiscal year," t he source said.Once the wages code comes into force, there will be significant changes in the way basic pay and provident fund of employees are calculated.The labour ministry had envisaged implementing the four codes on industrial relations, wages, social security and occupational health safety & working conditions from April 1, 2021. These four labour codes will rationalise 44 central labour laws.The ministry had even finalised the rules under the four codes. But these could not be implemented because many states were not in a position to notify rules under these codes in their jurisdictions.Labour is a concurrent subject under the Constitution of India and therefore both the Centre and states have to notify rules under these four codes to make them the laws of the land in their respective jurisdictions. According to the source, some states have worked  on draft rules on four labour codes. These states are Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Odisha, Punjab, Gujarat, Karnataka and Uttarakhand.Under the new wages code, allowances are capped at 50 per cent. This means half of the gross pay of an employee would be basic wages. Provident fund contribution is calculated as a percentage of basic wage, which includes basic pay and dearness allowance.  The employers have been splitting wages into numerous allowances to keep basic wages low to reduce provident fund and income tax outgo. The new wages code provides for provident fund contribution as a prescribed proportion of 50 per cent of gross pay.After the implementation of new codes, the take-home pay of employees would reduce while provident fund liability of employers would increase in many cases.Once implemented, employers would have to restructure salaries of their employees as per the new code on wages. Besides, the new industrial relation code would also improve ease of doing business by allowing firms with up to 300 workers to go ahead for lay-offs, retrenchment and closure without government permission. At present all firms with up to 100 employees are exempted from government permission for lay-off, retrenchment and closure.

However, a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh also dismissed the appeal saying there is no merit in it.“It is high time that such backdoor entries in educational institutions, including medical colleges, should stop. Lakhs of students all over the country work hard and toil to secure admissions to educational institutions on the basis of their merit,” the bench said in its order on September 9.“To permit any backdoor entry to any educational institution would be grossly unfair to those who are denied admission, despite being more meritorious, on account of the seats being taken and blocked by such backdoor entrants,” it said.It further added that the petitioners have only themselves to blame for the mess that they find themselves in.“Had they acted in terms of the discharge letter of April 26, 2017, they would have saved four years of their lives. But they did not, and acted recklessly. Despite not having any interim orders in their favour in their writ petition, they continued to attend the course—obviously, at their own peril,” the court said.Advocate T Singhdev, representing the MCI, said despite discharge of the petitioners by the MCI, as early as on April 26, 2017, the same was not acted upon either by the college or by the students and they continued to ignore it even after repeated communications.He further said that there was no interim order obtained by the petitioners from the court and despite that they continued to take admissions in subsequent years and undertake examinations at the college which was done at their own peril and they cannot claim equity in their favour.Singhdev said the petitioners did not undergo the centralised counselling and they were well aware from day one that their admissions in the college were irregular and illegal, being in the teeth of the judgement of the Supreme Court.The counsel for the petitioners contended that they ranked higher in the NEET examination than even those who were granted admission through the central counselling conducted by the DME in relation to this medical college and, therefore, they should be shown leniency.The court said it is for this reason that if the medical college had informed the vacancy position to the DME on time, the DME would have conducted further counselling and sent names on merit on the basis of the NEET examination conducted in 2016.“It is quite possible that the names of other candidates, more meritorious than the five petitioners, may have been sent,” the bench said.“Since the respondent medical college does not appear to have informed the DME of the vacancy position, and they proceeded to grant admissions to the five petitioners much before the close of the date of admission on October 7, 2016, the other meritorious students, obviously, remained unaware that they could stake a claim against a seat in the respondent medical college on the basis of their merit. Thus, to say that no other meritorious candidate has shown up, is neither here nor there,” it added.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/backdoor-entry-to-colleges-must-stop-delhi-hc-313351
19-09-2021||Chandigarh||Army developing UAV-mounted electronic intelligence gadgets to overcome limitations of ground-based sensors||The Indian Army has launched a project to develop an airborne system that can be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in an attempt to overcome the functional limitations of ground-based electronic intelligence gathering equipment.Operating height is of great importance as the range and capability of electronic signal capturing equipment, when placed on an elevated platform, enhances manifold when compared to the same equipment operating from the ground.Termed as an ‘Elevated Platform for Gathering Intelligence through Electronic Support Measures (ESM)’, the project is being executed by the Army’s Military College of Telecommunication Engineering located at Mhow near Indore. ESM gather intelligence through passive “listening” to radio transmissions or electromagnetic radiations and the data so generated can be used to assess the enemy’s tactical activity or develop a library on the signature and capability of the adversary’s equipment.At present, the electronic warfare systems in the Indian Army are man pack or vehicle based. These systems have the inherent limitations with respect to deployability, flexibility and are severely restricted by various terrain parameters such as line of sight issues in the mountains and vulnerability to enemy aircraft in the plains of deserts, states a request for information (RFI) from the industry floated by the Army this week for the design and development of an elevated platform.“The proposed system negates the above-mentioned requirements by incorporating an elevated platform. The system will increase flexibility in deployment, reduce deployment time and various limitations imposed by terrain. The qualitative requirements of the proposed system will enhance the ESM capability of the Indian Army and will enhance capability to detect, intercept, identify, locate, record, and analyse the electromagnetic transmission of the adversary at greater ranges,” the RFI adds. The system being developed will comprise a UAV on which the sensor and communications payload will be mounted and a ground station for launching controlling and recovering the UAV during operational missions. The ground stations will also be responsible for recording, processing, and analysing the data captured by the UAV.The army’s requirement is for a UAV with a flying endurance of more than six hours, payload capacity of at least 15 kg and a flight ceiling of 3,000 meters along with avionics such as GPS and collision detection and avoidance system.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-developing-uav-mounted-electronic-intelligence-gadgets-to-overcome-limitations-of-ground-based-sensors-313349

This is the only state where a Sikh has traditionally led. I have declined to be the CM,” Soni told The Tribune.It’s learnt that Soni was offered the CM ship two months ago also when the process of Punjab Congress overhaul was underway and she had refused even that time.“There are some convictions that we live by and my conviction is that a Sikh should lead Punjab,” Soni said.It’s learnt that the Congress was mulling all probable choices for the post of the CM, conscious also of the attack Capt Amarinder Singh mounted against PCC chief Navjot Sidhu calling him an anti national, and pledging to oppose his candidature as Punjab CM tooth and nail.Capt Amarinder has conveyed to the AICC leadership that Sidhu as CM was unacceptable.“What Capt will do next will depend on what we do today,” a Congress functionary said.Soni said the party exercise was underway to decide on the next CM.“The parleys are ongoing in Chandigarh where the AICC general secretary is present along with two observers who are meeting all the MLAs and asking them for their opinion. There’s no tussle in the party,” Soni said.Importantly Capt Amarinder Singh had called on Soni when he had come to New Delhi last to meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-chief-minister-must-be-sikh-leader-ambika-soni-rejects-offer-to-head-state-313345

I will shake the hand that comes towards me but if a fist is shown I will give that back,” Amarinder Singh said on Saturday citing his humiliation by the Congress.Gehlot, considered close to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, on Sunday took to Twitter to appeal to Capt Amarinder to keep Congress interests in mind when deciding his future.“Capt Amarinder is a respected Congress leader and I hope he will continue to work with party interest in mind. I am hopeful Capt Amarinder will not take any step that will hurt the Congress. Capt Singh himself said the party made him CM for 9.5 years and he worked to the best of his ability to serve the party.”“The high command sometimes has to take decisions in party interests based on feedback of MLAs and the people,” he saidSeeking to justify the actions of Gandhis in Congress President always takes opposition of potential CM contenders in mind when finalising a CM.“But then the same CMs start terming high command’s decision wrong when they are replaced.In such moments leaders should heed their conscience,” Gehlot advised Capt asking him to worry about the rise of fascist forces in India and “think in the party’s and national interest.”Amarinder Singh has said all his options were open.The former CM has also said he was in no mood to retire and was in fact ready for a battle.All eyes are now on Capt’s next moves and whether he would cosy-up to the BJP which has always backed his nationalist credentials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hope-captain-wont-act-against-party-interest-congress-anxiety-speaks-through-ashok-gehlot-313343

19-09-2021||Aditi Tandon||Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi stamp writ large||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 18The sudden and unceremonious exit of Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh signals the pre-eminence of the Gandhi siblings in the decision-making structure of the Congress and holds lessons for party veterans going forward.“The message in the story is — anything is possible,” said a Congress insider describing the midnight decision of the AICC to convene a Punjab CLP meeting on Saturday as a “surgical strike” on Capt Amarinder whom, sources said, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra increasingly viewed as “inaccessible, close to SAD and low-performing”.The trigger & course correctionThe trigger for Singh’s resignation was a recent letter nearly 60 party MLAs (out of 80) wrote to Congress president Sonia Gandhi seeking CM’s replacement to offset “anti incumbency” and saying in no uncertain terms that they will not be able to work with him anymore.“With the majority MLAs against the CM, there was no option but to replace him,” said a Congress functionary explaining that the party gave Amarinder Singh ample time to set the house in order.While Sonia Gandhi, known to have backed Amarinder Singh against graver rebellions specially the one by Rajinder Kaur Bhattal, gave the CM a long rope, Rahul and Priyanka are learnt to have pressed for something “drastic” specially after the BJP overhauled the entire Gujarat cabinet.Among issues that weighed against Singh were – he was not meeting MLAs regularly enough and the distance had led to alienation among lawmakers and party workers; he addressed few public functions in Punjab; thirdly, even ministers did not have direct access to him.“Inaccessibility remained a major challenge with Amarinder Singh and continued to be repeatedly raised finding traction with Rahul and Priyanka,” said a source.Matters worsened due to constant public acrimony between Punjab Congress chief Navjot Sidhu and Singh, with the party’s electoral prospects visibly hit. “This demanded immediate course correction,” said an AICC source.The majority of Punjab leaders had hoped the Congress leadership would replace the CM when they appointed Sidhu as state chief, to avoid parallel power centres. Two months on (Sidhu was named Punjab chief on July 18), the two were still at loggerheads, with Rahul and Priyanka worried what would happen at the time of candidate selection if both continued with their bitterness.“The calculation earlier was that the party needs both the CM and Sidhu to win but over these past two months, the bickering caused visible damages to the Congress, as AICC surveys reflected. A need was felt to course correct. After the majority MLAs expressed no confidence in the CM through a letter, scales tilted against him,” said a party insider adding that the CM’s position became untenable after Sonia Gandhi directed that a CLP meet be called. Veterans are however cross with Rahul and Priyanka over the way Singh’s ouster was handled with MLAs learnt to be in touch with Priyanka.This development, they said, would have repercussions in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh where infighting is deep. “Now Sachin Pilot can demand his pound of flesh against CM Ashok Gehlot and Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singhdeo can remind Rahul Gandhi of his 2018 promise to rotate the CM’s post. Pandora's Box has been opened,” said a source adding that Singh, a known Sonia loyalist, deserved a better exit plan.Sources added that public humiliation of Singh – as the outgoing CM himself claimed today after resigning – was totally avoidable and "harmed the Congress."“Congress President could have easily called CM and Sidhu and resolved matters rather than have MLAs speak against the CM on a platform offered by the AICC. This exercise of calling MLAs to Delhi in the name of resolving the Punjab crisis bore the stamp of Rahul Gandhi. This is not Sonia Gandhi’s style,” said a veteran.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-priyanka-gandhi-stamp-writ-large-313129

Our system, practices and rules being colonial in origin may not be best suited to the needs of Indian population,” the CJI said at a function organised in Bengaluru to pay tributes to late Justice Mohan M Shantanagoudar who died on April 25 at a private hospital in Gurugram.“The need of the hour is the Indianisation of our legal system. When I say Indianisation, I mean the need to adapt to the practical realities of our society and localise our justice delivery system,” Justice Ramana said.Noting that these were the topics Justice Shantanagoudar used to discuss with him everyday, the CJI said, “In losing him, the country has lost a common man's judge… I have personally lost the most cherished friend and a valuable colleague.”Justice Ramana said the simplification of justice delivery should be the pressing concern.Simplify proceduresCourts need to be litigant-centric as they are the ultimate beneficiaries. The simplification of justice delivery should be our pressing concern at the moment. —Justice NV Ramana, CJIParties from rural areas fighting family disputes were usually made to feel out of place in the court as they didn’t understand arguments or pleadings, mostly in English — a language alien to them, he said, adding that these days judgments have become lengthy, further complicating the position of litigants.“For parties to understand the implication of the judgment, they are forced to spend more money. Courts need to be litigant-centric as they are the ultimate beneficiaries. The simplification of justice delivery should be our pressing concern. It is crucial to make justice delivery more transparent, accessible and effective,” the CJI said.“A common man while approaching the court should not feel scared of judges and the courts; he should be able to speak the truth. It is the duty of lawyers and judges to create an environment which is comforting for litigants and other stakeholders,” he said.“We must not forget that the focal point of any justice system is the litigant,” the CJI said, adding that “use of alternative dispute redressal mechanisms, such as mediation and conciliation, would go a long way in reducing the friction between parties and save resources. It also reduces the pendency and requirement of having lengthy arguments and judgments.”Focus on mediationThe Chief Justice of India said the use of alternative dispute redressal mechanisms, such as mediation and conciliation, would go a long way in reducing the friction between parties and saving resources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indianise-legal-system-to-make-justice-delivery-more-effective-cji-313131

We condemn this sick mentality of Delhi Govt & demand @ArvindKejriwal Ji to take strictest action against concerned DC & SDM Geeta Grover.”Sirsa added that the order was issued to close the gurdwara which has helped many people during the Covid-19 second wave and lockdown by organising ‘langar’ (free food service) and setting up beds for patients.The Chanakyapuri SDM office, however, said whatever has happened is according to the DDMA order, and refused to comment further.

There have been instances where professional receipts have been camouflaged as loans in the books of accounts for the purpose of evasion of tax,” the policy-making body for the tax department said.These bogus loans, it said, have been used for “making investments and acquiring properties.”                The total amount of tax evaded unearthed so far amounts to more than Rs 20 crore, the statement and official sources said about Sood.It also talked about his charity organisation that was established during the Covid-19 outbreak last year.The actor shot to national prominence after he arranged free transport through rail, air and road for numerous migrant workers to reach their home states during the nationwide lockdown clamped last year to contain the spread of coronavirus pandemic.The Delhi government, led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, had also recently declared that Sood will be the brand ambassador of the Aam Aadmi Party government’s ‘Desh ka mentors’ programme under which students will be guided in making their career choices.The CBDT said the charity foundation set up by the actor was incorporated on July 21, 2020, and has collected donations to the tune of Rs 18.94 crore from April 1, 2021 till date.Out of this, it said, the foundation has spent around Rs 1.9 crore for various relief works and the balance of Rs 17 crore has been found lying “unutilised” in its bank account.It is seen, the statement alleged, that funds to the tune of Rs 2.1 crore have also been raised by the charity foundation from overseas donors on a crowdfunding platform “in violation” of FCRA regulations.It said the actor had entered into a joint venture with the Lucknow-located infrastructure group and “invested substantial funds”, and said the taxman has unearthed “incriminating” evidence pertaining to tax evasion and irregularities in the account books.“The search has revealed that the said group is involved in bogus billing of sub-contracting expenses and siphoning off of funds. Evidence of such bogus contracts found so far are to the tune of over Rs 65 crore,” it said.Evidence of unaccounted cash expenses, unaccounted sale of scrap and digital data evidencing unaccounted cash transactions has also been found.The infra group “has entered into dubious circular transaction to the tune of Rs 175 crore with an infrastructure company based in Jaipur”.“Further investigations are being carried out to establish the full extent of tax evasion,” it said.The CBDT said Rs 1.8 crore cash has been seized during the raids and 11 lockers have been placed under “prohibitory orders”.A total of 28 premises in Mumbai, Lucknow, Kanpur, Jaipur, Delhi, and Gurgaon are being covered as part of the search operation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-t-dept-alleges-rs-20-crore-tax-evasion-by-actor-sonu-sood-312965
