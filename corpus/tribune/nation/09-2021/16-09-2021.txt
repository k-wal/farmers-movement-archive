The police registered a case under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) at the APMC police station, he said.“The police did not have much material to identify the victim, except the name ‘Ravindra’ and Lord Hanuman’s image tattooed on one of the chopped arms. It was a challenging case. Several police teams were formed to identify the victim, to trace the accused and also find out the remaining body parts,” Singh said.The teams were sent to Thane, Raigad, Mumbai and Navi Mumbai to probe the case. Details of 100 missing persons reported under the Navi Mumbai police commissionerate were analysed, he added.“During the probe, the police came to know that one Ravindra Mandotiya, a sweeper, has gone missing from his house and a complaint had been registered in this regard at Koparkhairne police station. His family members were called to identify the victim and the chopped arm with the tattoo was shown to them. They confirmed that the body parts were that of Mandotiya,” he added.Thereafter, the police worked on several leads and went through the CCTV footage, among other things, and nabbed Chouhan, the commissioner said.“During his interrogation, Chouhan told the police there was a monetary dispute between him and the victim. As part of his plan to eliminate Mandotiya, Chouhan slit his throat on September 9 and later cut his body into several pieces. He packed these parts in a plastic bag and dumped in the APMC area, while head and some other parts were buried in Mahape area,” another police official said.Police later recovered the remaining body parts.The police official said that the accused, who was arrested on September 14, was produced before a local court, which remanded him into police custody till September 22.Assistant Commissioner of Police (Vashi division) Vinayak Vast told reporters that the police were trying to find out if any more persons were involved in this crime.

16-09-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||GST council: Kerala to oppose move to bring petrol and diesel under GST regime||Kerala on Thursday said it will vehemently oppose any move to bring petrol and diesel under the GST regime as that will further reduce revenue generation for the state and asserted that the Centre should reduce its levies on the two commodities to provide relief to the common people.Central excise and state VAT (Value Added Tax) make up for almost half of the retail selling price of petrol and diesel. Bringing them under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) would impact revenue generation for the states.Talking to PTI, Kerala Finance Minister K N Balagopal said the state will strongly oppose, if there is any move to bring petrol and diesel under the GST regime.He said the fuel prices skyrocketed due to the huge increase of its cess by the Centre and if the Union Government reduces the cess, that will help in bringing down the prices of petrol and diesel.According to him, if petrol and diesel are brought under the GST regime, the state will lose Rs 8,000 crore annually.In June, the Kerala High Court, based on a writ petition, had asked the GST Council to decide on bringing petrol and diesel within the goods and services tax (GST) ambit.Five commodities – crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel, and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) – were kept out of the GST purview when it was introduced on July 1, 2017 considering the revenue dependence of the central and state governments on them.Recently, the spike in global oil prices on demand recovery pushed petrol and diesel prices to an all-time high, leading to demand for bringing it under the GST.

All the issues raised are dead ones and probably do not merit any attention.” Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the Union government as well as the state governments are fully emerged in fighting a pandemic and all our energies and time is devoted to that.“We greatly value journalistic and editorial freedom and at the same time we must also realise that all of us — Union government as well as the state governments — are fully emerged in fighting a pandemic and all our energies and time is devoted to that,” he said.“We cannot afford to be diverted by things that can be addressed at a later day which are not priority from the public health point of view,” Bhushan said.NITI Aayog Member (Health) Dr VK Paul condemned the article.“We actually condemn this type of distorted out of context reporting.

They were inserted to the original IT Rules in February this year.The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice PD Audikesavalu granted the stay while passing interim orders on a batch of PILs from carnatic musician T M Krishna and Digital News Publishers Association, consisting of 13 media outlets and another individual, challenging the constitutional validity of the new rules.Prima facie, there is substance in the contention of the petitioners that the mechanism to control the media by government may rob the media, both print and electronic, of their independence and the democratic principles, the bench said.The court adjourned the matter to the last week of October, when it was informed that similar cases pending before the Supreme Court are scheduled to come up for hearing in the first week of next month.The Bombay High Court, while granting the interim stay in August, had held that “dissent” was vital for democracy.Sub-clauses 1 and 3 of clause 9 of the new Rules were, on the face of it, “manifestly unreasonable”, and “the indeterminate and wide terms of the Rules bring about a chilling effect qua (regarding) the right of freedom of speech and expression of writers/editors/publishers” as they can be hauled up for anything if the authorities so wish, it had then said.Rule 9 (1) reads: “A publisher referred to in rule 8 shall observe and adhere to the Code of Ethics laid down in the Appendix annexed to these rules”.Rule 9(3) says: “For ensuring observance and adherence to the Code of Ethics by publishers operating in the territory of India, and for addressing the grievances made in relation to publishers under this Part, there shall be a three-tier structure as under— (a) Level I - Self-regulation by the publishers; (b) Level II – Self-regulation by the self-regulating bodies of the publishers; (c) Level III - Oversight mechanism by the Central Government”.—     Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-it-rules-madras-hc-stays-controversial-sub-clauses-312084
16-09-2021||New Delhi||Cong seeks judicial probe against Modi, ICMR officials over media report on Covid-19 response||The Congress on Thursday cited a recent media report to allege “criminal culpability” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former Health Minister Harsh Vardhan and senior officials of the ICMR in fudging Covid-19 data “to build a false narrative that everything was normal” ahead of the second wave, and demanded a judicial inquiry against them.Citing the New York Times report which quoted former scientists of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to claim political interference in giving out data on Covid-19 and related deaths, senior spokesperson of the Congress Ajay Maken said this is a very serious issue and should be probed by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court or a high court.The government has rejected the media report with Niti Aayog member (health) V K Paul describing it as “out of context report that is not desirable”.ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said, “This is a provocative, attention seeking article published at a time when India is doing good and our vaccination is excellent and it is diverting attention. All the issues raised are dead ones and probably do not merit any attention.”At a press conference, Maken said former ICMR scientists have themselves come out openly now and said that because of political interference, the data was fudged and a false narrative was built that everything is normal.“We are demanding that a criminal investigation be carried out against the prime minister, against the former health minister and against senior officials of ICMR,” he told reporters.The Congress leader said this is a very serious issue that the scientists have raised and noted that the party has said earlier too that an inquiry is best conducted when it is a judicial inquiry conducted by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court or a high court under the supervision of the court.“That is the best form of any investigation. There should be a criminal investigation under court supervision by a sitting judge as this is not a small matter,” he said.“We feel that it was because of this reason that the guard was lowered and the state governments were unprepared and so was the general public, because of which there were large number of avoidable deaths during the second wave of coronavirus that caused so much devastation,” he said.“We could have saved so many lives had the false narrative not started and hence it requires a criminal investigation,” he said.The Congress party will hit the streets on the issue as well as raise it in Parliament in the coming days, Maken said.

Getting the two doses remains the major priority,” Bhargava said.“Several agencies have recommended that antibody levels should not be measured...but the important understanding is that full vaccination of both the doses is absolutely essential and there should be no breakage in that,” he said.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said 20 per cent of India’s adult population have received both doses of Covid-19 vaccine and 62 per cent have got at least one dose.Also, 99 per cent of the healthcare workers have received the first dose while 82 per cent of the eligible healthcare workers have taken the second dose.Bhushan further said that 100 per cent of the frontline workers have been administered the first dose while 78 per cent of them have been given the second dose.So far, all adult people in five states and union territories—Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Chandigarh and Lakshadweep—have received at least one dose of the vaccine.According to data, the average daily doses administered in a month has increased from 19.69 lakh in May to 39.89 lakh in June, then further to 43.41 lakh in July and to 59.19 lakh in August.The average daily vaccination in the first 15 days of September has been 74.40 lakh per day, Bhushan said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-booster-dose-not-central-theme-at-the-moment-centre-312081

Otherwise, you can arrange a marriage on a field as well.”Gadkari pointed out that the expressway will decrease travel time significantly, which will result in reduction in cost of fuel.“The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will decrease travel time to 12 hours. A truck takes 48 hours to reach Mumbai from Delhi. But on the expressway, it will take only 18 hours.“So, a truck will be able to undertake more trips, which would in turn mean more business,” Gadkari said.

16-09-2021||New Delhi||Rakesh Asthana appointed as Delhi CP in public interest, Centre tells HC||The Centre has told the Delhi High Court that the appointment of Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner was done in public interest, keeping in mind the diverse law and order challenges faced by the national capital, which have national security implications as well as international/cross border implications.Defending Asthana’s appointment, the Centre in an affidavit, said it felt a “compelling need” to “appoint a person as a head of the police force of Delhi, who had diverse and vast experience of heading a large police force in a large state having diverse political as well as public order problem/experience of working and supervising Central Investigating Agency(s) as well as para-military forces”.“The prime consideration for the same was that Delhi being the capital of the country has been witnessing diverse and extremely challenging situations of public order/law and order situation/policing issues which not only had national security implications but also international/cross border implications,” said the affidavit filed by the Secretary, Union Home Ministry.In the affidavit filed through lawyer Amit Mahajan, the Centre said no fault can be found in the appointment of Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner, which has been done in accordance with and after scrupulously following all the applicable rules and regulations.The affidavit was filed in response to a public interest litigation which has sought quashing of the July 27 order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs appointing Asthana as the Delhi Police Commissioner and also the order granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him just before his superannuation on July 31.The Centre has contended that the plea is an “abuse of process of law and manifestly an outcome of some personal vendetta” while submitting that a PIL in service matter is not maintainable.It said the PIL, as well as the intervention of NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) – which has challenged Asthana’s appointment before the Supreme Court, “deserves to be dismissed with exemplary costs”.“The petitioner and the intervener are mere busy bodies. Both the petitioner and more particularly the intervener who claims to be espousing a public cause, never considered challenging appointment of eight (8) erstwhile Police Commissioners though they were appointed in the same manner as is done in the case of Respondent No.2 (Asthana).“Such a selective exhibition of ‘public interest’ speaks volume about the motive behind filing this petition/intervention application/writ petition in the Supreme Court respectively by the petitioner /intervener only in case of the Respondent No 2,” the affidavit said.The petition has contended that the appointment of Asthana is in clear and blatant breach of the directions passed by the Supreme Court in Prakash Singh case as the officer does not have a minimum residual tenure of six months and no UPSC panel was formed for his appointment of Delhi Police Commissioner.It also contended that the High-Powered Committee comprising the Chief Justice of India, Prime Minister and the Leader of Opposition, in its meeting held on May 24, 2021, rejected the Central government’s attempt to appoint Asthana as the CBI Director on the basis of the six-month rule as laid down by the Supreme Court in the Prakash Singh case.The appointment of Asthana to the post of Commissioner of Police, Delhi must be set aside on the same principle, it said.The petition with similar prayers which has been filed by CPIL before the Supreme Court has urged to direct the central government to produce the July 27 order it issued, approving the inter-cadre deputation of Asthana from Gujarat cadre to AGMUT cadre.The petition has also urged the apex court to set aside the Centre’s order to extend Asthana’s service period.On August 25, the Supreme Court had asked the high court to decide within two weeks the plea pending before it against the appointment of the senior IPS officer as Delhi Police Commissioner.The matter was listed for hearing on Thursday but the concerned bench was not available and now it will be heard on September 20.

This was done keeping in mind the trend of a delayed retreat of monsoon observed over the last few years.The southwest monsoon starts withdrawing from west Rajasthan first. According to the revised date, it starts withdrawing from Jaisalmer on September 17.The southwest monsoon saw delayed withdrawals in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020.A delayed withdrawal of monsoon also means a delayed onset of winter.Officially, the southwest monsoon season starts on June 1 and lasts till September 30. — PTI o||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/southwest-monsoon-unlikely-to-retreat-from-northwest-india-by-september-end-312050

The police stated that only a small piece of his leg could be recovered.Additional Sessions Judge said that prima facie there is enough material on record to frame charges against the accused, namely Lakhpat Rajora, Yogesh, Lalit, and two men named Kuldeep under the requisite sections of the Indian Penal Code.The judge noted that the Call Data Record (CDR) locations of all the accused have been found at the spot on the date of the incident, which is prima facie out of their routine locations.ASJ Yadav also concurred with the prosecution’s contentions that the accused were not visible in the CCTV footage as the rioters had broken virtually every camera in the vicinity and damaged the digital video recorders (DVRs) during the violence.The judge noted that even though there was a delay in recording the statement of public witnesses, he cannot lose sight of the fact that police were facing difficulty to trace them as people were shocked and traumatized and it took them time to muster the courage to report the matter.“Statements cannot be brushed aside merely because there has been some delay in recording thereof or that the complainant did not specifically name/identify the accused persons in his initial written complaint made to the police,” the sessions judge said.They have been charged under sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 302 (murder), 395 (dacoity), 427 (mischief), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance) of the IPC and various sections of the Arms Act.Under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), an accused should be informed of the offence under which he is charged. The basic purpose of the charge is to let them know of the offence that they are charged with so that they can prepare defence. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-court-frames-charges-against-5-accused-for-setting-man-on-fire-inside-ramlila-ground-312048

These materials can be designed not only for transparent to visible light but also for ultraviolet, Infrared and radiofrequency, giving opportunity for diverse applications.Though produced by different countries globally, transparent ceramics are restricted in supply as they can be used for strategic applications. Several attempts were made in the country earlier, but the transparent ceramics so produced were either on a laboratory scale or low transparency.The currently developed process through a technique called colloidal processing followed by simultaneous application of temperature and pressure, is able to produce the sizes usable for several applications on a pilot scale, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology on Wednesday.Generally prepared from high purity powders through a line of critically engineered processing steps, transparent ceramics needs preparation processes that will help achieve theoretical transparency by eliminating defects.Chemical vapour deposition involving reactions of the precursors in the vapor phase at elevated temperatures and hotisostatic pressing involving simultaneous application of temperature and pressure are a few advanced processing techniques generally practiced to address the above challenges.

It is also a well-known launch pad for trained terrorists.The investigation and the interrogation of suspects has not only revealed details of how Pakistan’s military has been training recruits from India and Bangladesh, but it has also exposed an altogether new route adopted by the ISI to admit the terror trainees into Pakistan and the Afghanistan-Pak region, the security officials said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/day-after-terror-module-busted-in-delhi-pak-camp-on-radar-311697

The Speaker, however, refrained from divulging what exactly provoked him to express concern about the behaviour of lawmakers.Birla emphasised that the members were expected to observe the highest standards of discipline and decorum, both inside and outside the legislatures.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-speaker-om-birla-unruly-behaviour-by-lawmakers-on-rise-311699

After the “abba jaan” jibe by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait has now called AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi “chacha jaan” and a “B team of the BJP”.“Owaisi and the BJP are a team. He is BJP’s ‘chacha jaan’ (uncle). He has the blessings of the BJP. He will abuse them, but they will not file a case against him. The BJP will take his help. Farmers need to understand their moves,” Tikait warned.The BJP, whose CM landed the “abba jaan” punch against closest rival Samajwadi Party a couple of days ago, has been accusing Owaisi and BSP supremo Mayawati of playing “communal politics”.Mayawati is being accused of trying to divide Brahmins, a sizable vote bank, political influencers and traditional supporters of the saffron party in the state, as they are said to be upset with Adityanath for “targeting the community and favouring Thakurs”. Observers, however, say the move would also help the BJP.Interestingly, soon after Owaisi stepped into the UP’s political arena, he has been facing accusations from the anti-BJP groupings that he is the “B team” of the BJP who is trying to “divide Muslims” to dent “the traditional vote base” of the SP.Urging Muslims in Uttar Pradesh to “learn from West Bengal who did not get influenced by Owaisi”, they claimed that the AIMIM chief “is only contesting in UP so that the BJP can win”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rakesh-tikait-calls-owaisi-chacha-jaan-of-bjp-311705

16-09-2021||Aditi Tandon||World Bank estimates 21 million to be out of Covid-induced poverty||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 15The World Bank on Wednesday cut back on Covid-induced poverty estimates by 21 million saying the global poverty may be turning the corner on the pandemic in 2021, but warned that the number of the poor on account of Covid was still unprecedented.“In 2021, we project global poverty to decrease by about 21 million people compared with 2020. The implications of this estimate are that global poverty is projected to decline, and the pace of reduction is returning to the pre-pandemic trend. In that sense, one could say that global poverty may be turning the corner on the pandemic in 2021,” the World Bank said in its latest estimations.World BankStill unprecedentedWe find that the pandemic led to 97 mn more people being in poverty in 2020. This is a reduction of about 21 mn from our last estimate. Even this reduced estimate represents an unprecedented increase in poverty.Basing its calculations of pandemic-induced poverty estimates on the latest growth forecasts available from the Global Economic Prospect (GEP) and the pre-pandemic counterfactual from the January 2020 GEP forecasts, the World Bank had, in January 2021, estimated that Covid would push between 119 and 124 million people into extreme poverty around the globe in 2020.But revising these numbers based on updates to global poverty data that occurred in March and June and on the recently launched growth forecasts from the June 2021 version of the GEP, the Wrold Bank today said: “We find that the pandemic led to 97 million more people being in poverty in 2020. This is a reduction of about 21 million from our last estimate. Even this reduced estimate represents a historically unprecedented increase in global poverty.”“Because the pace of reduction is similar to what we expected before the pandemic spread, the recovery taking place will not be sufficient to close the gap the pandemic is estimated to have caused in 2020. Globally, the increase in poverty that occurred in 2020 due to Covid still lingers,” the World Bank said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/world-bank-estimates-21-million-to-be-out-of-covid-induced-poverty-311707

It only has a series of facts and communication that show the errors in functioning.“The days of frontal attacks of tanks and infantry will not happen. Long-range missiles using space-based tracking technology would possibly be used as the first offence by the enemy,” he said while delivering a speech on “Towards Progressive Defence Reforms” hosted by India International Centre (IIC) on Wednesday.Set up national security admn serviceWe need to look into the setting up of a national security administration service. We should have people of this cadre posted in the MoD, Home Affairs and on some posts of the Foreign Affairs. NN Vohra, former J&k GovernorNN Vohra, the IIC President and former Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, chaired the session.On the use of technology, the General said there was scope for looking at space-based systems and artificial intelligence engines. “Technology is the need of the hour and the Services need to understand technology,” he stressed. “A specialised rocket force is being created,” he replied in response to a question. China already has a dedicated rocket force.Space-based techThe days of frontal attacks of tanks and infantry will not happen. Long-range missiles using space-based tracking technology would possibly be used as the first offence by the enemy. Gen Bipin Rawat, Chief of Defence StaffOn China, the CDS said it was now more aggressive. “Pakistan will keep us engaged in a proxy war. It is a proxy of China,” he said.Earlier, Vohra, a former Defence Secretary, elucidated how the security threat to India was growing. “It is important that the military is successful in delivering a punch to the aggressor, and for that the three Services have to be cohesive,” he said.“Coordinated functioning in war would be important. Earlier attempts in the 1980s to create joint structures did not meet with success,” he pointed out as he recalled his days in the Defence Ministry. “We had tried to bring about content and the syllabi of the military education at the NDA and Wellington Staff College. These efforts did not succeed as the then Service Chief had no interest and the political echelons were not well-oriented,” he said.On the Kargil Review Committee, on which the former Governor drafted one of the four reports, he said: “We had suggested taking officers of all cadres for two years and retaining the best. As the security needs grow, we need large security management bodies and trained people with reliable minds,” he added.On the need to publish war histories, Vohra suggested: “Use the United Services Institution (USI) or the Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA). In case they don’t, give it to me, we will publish it.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cds-days-of-frontal-attack-over-technology-need-of-hour-311708

The government said it had appointed 84 members to various tribunals since 2020.Pointing out that the government picked up only three names from the judicial list, four from the technical and five from the waiting list, the Bench said: “We don’t know what type of appointment this is. It’s against service law. How can you go to thecontinued on page 13waiting list without exhausting the final list?”It sought to know why the government appointed only a few from the list finalised by the search-cum-selection committee headed by a sitting judge of the top court. The committee — which also includes the Law Secretary and Secretary of the parent ministry of the tribunal as its members — had cleared 11 names for judicial and 10 for technical along with a waiting list.“We are very unhappy with the way things are going on and decisions are taken. There’s a problem and everyone is aware of it. We gave the solution, which is appointments and it’s for you to implement it. Without inviting orders from this court, if you can do something we will be happy,” said the Bench, which included Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice LN Rao.Ahead of Wednesday’s hearing, the government had on September 12 notified 84 appointments to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) and the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT).However, describing the condition as “pitiable”, a dissatisfied Bench said litigants couldn’t be “left in the lurch”. It asked the Centre to make appointments in two weeks in tribunals awaiting appointments of presiding officers, judicial members and technical members.During hearing on petitions seeking filling of around 250 vacancies in tribunals, Attorney General KK Venugopal said the Centre would make appointments in two weeks in the tribunals from the list of persons recommended by the search and selection committee.The Bench asked the government to explain the reasons as to why persons from the recommended list were left out in the process.As Venugopal said the government was entitled to make a choice as per the Tribunal Reforms Act, 2021, the Bench shot back, “What is the sanctity of the selection process if the government has the last word?...It’s a waste of time.”The top court expressed displeasure over the Centre extending jurisdiction of the Debts Recovery Tribunal of one state to another state due to unfilled vacancy of Presiding Officer. Issuing notice to the Centre on its notification on the issue, it wondered how it was possible for someone in Jabalpur to appear before a DRT Bench in Lucknow.It also issued notices to the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Odisha Government and others on a petition challenging the abolition of the Odisha Administrative Tribunal (OAT).

The raids, incidentally, come days after the Bollywood star had a high-profile meeting with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who declared him the brand ambassador for his government’s mentorship programme for school students in the Capital. After the meeting, Sonu Sood had denied having any plans to take the plunge into politics. During the lockdown, the actor had won praise for doing charity work and helping migrant workers reach their respective villages.Reacting to the raids, Kejriwal tweeted: “... truth always prevails. Sonu Sood has the blessings of lakhs of families whom he had helped during their difficult times.” BJP spokesperson Asif Bhamla called it a search, not a raid. “The I-T department is just doing its job,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/income-tax-department-surveys-6-premises-linked-to-sonu-sood-in-maharashtra-up-311710

The PLI scheme for drones and drone component industry aims to address the strategic, tactical and operational uses of this revolutionary technology in the next three years with an outlay of Rs 120 crore. Union Minister Anurag Thakur said incentives worth Rs 25,938 crore would be provided to the industry over five years and it was expected that the automobile and auto-components industry would see fresh investment of over Rs 42,500 crore, incremental production of over Rs 2.3 lakh crore and would create over 7.5 lakh jobs. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs-26-058-crore-for-auto-drone-industries-311714

I do not like to put a number on the package as it is revenue-neutral for the government.” He went on to add that the moratorium would not impact the government’s revenue.Incidentally, the government announced the package six weeks after Kumar Mangalam Birla resigned from the post of chairman of Vodafone Idea Limited, which was created following the merger of British telecom giant Vodafone’s India unit and Birla’s Idea Cellular Ltd. The company has to pay around Rs 50,399.63 crore as statutory dues based on AGR (adjusted gross revenue) over the past several years.The relief package will include a moratorium on payments for airwaves and is aimed at helping telecom service providers (TSPs) like Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea, industry sources said. They said as per the announcement, the companies would also have the option to convert interest on spectrum dues of the four-year moratorium period into government equity.Last year, the Supreme Court passed a ruling asking Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea to clear government dues, which hit the sector hard and even banks led by the SBI had called on the government to give Vodafone Idea more time to clear its tax dues.Along with the relief package, the government has also approved a number of structural and process reforms in the sector. “These are expected to protect and generate employment opportunities, promote healthy competition, protect interests of consumers, infuse liquidity, encourage investment and reduce regulatory burden on the TSPs,” the minister said.Among these changes, there are nine structural and five process reforms and the AGR definition had been rationalised to exclude non-telecom revenues, the minister said.To encourage investment, he said, 100 per cent FDI under automatic route had been permitted, besides rationalising spectrum user charges. “In future auctions, tenure of the spectrum will be increased to 30 years from 20 currently. Auction calendar has been fixed. The spectrum auctions will be normally held in the last quarter of every financial year. The tower set-up process will now be simplified on the basis of self-approval,” Vaishnaw said.Easy switch from prepaid to postpaidKYC process for shifting from prepaid to postpaid has been done away with.

16-09-2021||New Delhi||Month since escaping Taliban, refugee Afghan Sikhs uncertain about future||Baldeep Singh, an Afghan Sikh, who fled to India after Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, knows three languages, including Hindi and French, but has been having a hard time finding a job to feed his family.This is the case not only with Sikhs who arrived in the midst of the fall of Kabul to the Taliban on August 15 but also those who left the country before, said the 24-year-old, who is at present living in New Mahavir Nagar.The Taliban swept across Afghanistan last month, seizing control of almost all key towns and cities in the backdrop of withdrawal of the US forces that began on May 1. It took over Kabul on August 15 and unveiled a hardline interim government.This is not the first time that Baldeep Singh has left Afghanistan.On March 25 last year, his mother was killed in a terrorist attack while she was outside their room at Kabul’s Guru Har Rai Sahib Gurdwara. In May that year, Baldeep Singh left for India, fearing for his and his family’s safety.However, a few months later, he returned to Kabul. “That is the place I was born. That is the place where my mother died. How could I be somewhere else,” he said.But the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan meant, Baldeep Singh had to flee Kabul again, and this time he does not know if he will ever be able to go back. Looking at his mother’s photo on his mobile phone, he said, “She went downstairs to offer prayers and was killed in a terrorist attack. Around 25 people had died”.    The family, including his father, grandmother, two brothers and uncle, had fled Afghanistan in May last year. “The attack had shaken us,” he said. On the current situation in the country, Baldeep Singh said, “It is turning worse every day. Yesterday, the Talibs abducted a Sikh at gunpoint”.     His maternal uncle, Raj Singh, who had left Afghanistan three years ago, says around 300 people, including Sikhs, are still stuck in Kabul, Ghazni and Jalalabad, and are desperate to leave the country.“Didn’t you see the videos? They are butchering people, riddling them with bullets. What else do you expect,” he said when asked about the situation in the war-torn country a month after Kabul fell to the Taliban.Around 73 Afghan Sikhs came to India since then. A few families have left for Punjab where they have relatives. The ones in Delhi depend on the help from Gurdwara Guru Arjan Dev in New Mahavir Nagar.At least six such families have been living in the gurdwara since they completed their mandatory quarantine period at the ITBP facility in Chhawla area.The Sobti Foundation of New York-based philanthropist Mandeep Singh Sobti has come forward to adopt them.Kanv Bhalla, an entrepreneur coordinating rehabilitation efforts on behalf of the foundation, said these families are being shifted to rented accommodations and eligible persons will be given jobs according to their skills.However, Raj Singh said it is difficult for displaced Sikh families to find their feet in India without citizenship.“We struggle to get a SIM card or cooking gas cylinder. Even if we go to hospital, they ask for Aadhaar card. We have no value without an Indian identity card. We cannot travel outside Delhi like others do,” he rued.He said most of the Sikh refugee families who had come to India earlier have been living hand to mouth.Baldeep Singh said he started selling mobile covers a few months ago, but the lockdown rendered him without work last year.“I can do anything. I am a quick learner. I can work at an apparel store or drive a car, you tell me,” he said.Amarjit Singh, 45, was among the 49 Afghani Sikhs who flew into Delhi from Kabul via Dushanbe on an Air India flight last month.He has been putting up at the gurdwara along with his wife and five children, one of them aged three months.“The Taliban doesn’t care for its own people, forget about Sikhs. You have no idea what these people are going through,” he said. Amarjit Singh, who owned a grocery shop in Kabul, said he is ready to polish shoes if that gives him enough money to feed his children.“I am not ashamed of selling potatoes and onions. I have to feed my children. There is no shame in honest work,” he said.Kirpal Singh, who sold medicinal herbs in Kabul, came to India empty-handed. “I did not get any time to pack a pair of clothes.”               “I had a good earning there. Here, I may not have anything but I am alive. I will do whatever work I get. The priority is survival,” the father of three children said.An intelligence officer who fled Afghanistan days before the Taliban stormed Kabul, admits life as a refugee has been harder than he thought.“My family is still stuck in the country. And here I have no one of my own. I had planned to start a business in India but that’s easier said than done,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/month-since-escaping-taliban-refugee-afghan-sikhs-uncertain-about-future-311623
16-09-2021||Satya Prakash||Appointments to tribunals: SC takes strong exception to ‘cherry picking’ by Centre||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 15The face-off between the Government and the judiciary over appointments to various tribunals continued on Wednesday with the Supreme Court taking strong exception to “cherry picking” by the Centre in recently cleared appointments.A Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana made certain harsh comments on the Centre even as the latter said there were no recommendations pending with it for appointments to tribunals. The Government said it has appointed 84 members to various tribunals since 2020.Pointing out that the government picked up only three names from the judicial list, four from the technical and five from the waiting list, the Bench said, “We don’t know what type of appointment this is. It’s against service law. How can you go to the waiting list without exhausting the final list?”The top court also took exception to the “hurried” appointment of Justice M Venugopal as Acting Chairperson of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal and asked the Attorney General to take instructions for hearing on the issue on Thursday.It sought to know why the Government appointed only a few from the list finalised by the search-cum-selection committee headed by a sitting judge of the top court.The committee—which also includes the law secretary and secretary of the parent ministry of the tribunal as its members—had cleared 11 names for judicial and 10 for technical along with a waiting list.“We are very unhappy with the way things are going on and decisions are taken. There’s a problem and everyone is aware of it. We gave the solution, which is appointments and it’s for you to implement it. Without inviting orders from this court, if you can do something we will be happy,” said the Bench – which also included Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice LN Rao.Ahead of Wednesday’s hearing, the Government had on 12 September notified 84 appointments to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) and Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT).However, describing the condition as “pitiable”, a dissatisfied Bench said litigants cannot be “left in the lurch”.

16-09-2021||New Delhi||Battleground UP: After Adityanath’s ‘Abba jaan’ jibe, Rakesh Tikait calls Owasi ‘Chacha jaan’, ‘B team of BJP’||The battle for poll-bound Uttar Pradesh is getting murkier by the day. After the “Abba jaan” jibe by the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath now BKU leader Rakesh Tikait has called the AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi “Chacha jaan and a team of the BJP”.“Owaisi and the BJP are a team. He is BJP’s ‘Chacha jaan’ (uncle). He has the blessings of the BJP. He will abuse them, but they will not file a case against him. The BJP will take his help, farmers need to understand their moves,” Tikait warned.The BJP, whose CM landed the “Abba jaan” punch against closest rival Samajwadi Party a couple of days back, has been accusing Owaisi and BSP supremo Mayawati of doing “communal politics”. Mayawati is being accused of trying to divide Brahmins—a sizeable vote force, political influencers and traditional supporters of saffron party in the state, who are said to be upset with Adityanath for “targeting the community and favouring Thakurs”. However, observers say the move will also help the BJP.Also read: Omar Abdullah targets Yogi AdityanathCountry belongs to all, maintain restraint in comments: JD (U) on Adityanath’s ‘abba jaan’ remarksInterestingly, soon after Owasi stepped into UP’s political arena, he has been facing accusations from anti-BJP groupings that he is the “B-team” of the BJP who is trying to “divide Muslims” in order to dent “the traditional vote base” of SP.Urging Muslims in UP to “learn from West Bengal who did not get influenced by Owaisi”, they claimed that the AIMIM chief “is only contesting in UP so that the BJP can win”.This is not the first time the four-time Lok Sabha MP from Hyderabad has faced such allegations. He was “single-handedly” held responsible for the defeat of the Grand Alliance in Bihar in 2020 by the RJD. Terming him the “B-team of the BJP-RSS”, senior RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari said that “Owaisi fought at the behest of the BJP in order to defeat the Grand Alliance in Bihar” in “an election that could, otherwise, had the potential to change the politics of the country”.Right at the beginning of his political campaign, Owaisi said that he had come to UP “to defeat the BJP” and has been attacking SP for “cheating Muslims in the name of secularism”. “Our first effort is that our Muslim leadership should be developed in the biggest state of the country”, he was quoted as saying in Ayodhya while urging the community to not live “in the shadows”. “Nineteen percent (of voters) are Muslims and nine percent are Yadavs. But the CM will be yours (Yadavs) and we (Muslims) will not even get the job of a peon,” he said.Owaisi’s party is preparing to contest 100 of the 403 assembly seats in UP. The SP, which is relying on the Muslim-Yadav combination to reclaim the state, is currently the topmost challenger to the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP in UP. Observers say any dent in the traditional vote bank of the Samajwadi Party will only benefit the BJP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/battleground-up-after-adityanaths-abba-jaan-jibe-rakesh-tikait-calls-owasi-chacha-jaan-b-team-of-bjp-311553
