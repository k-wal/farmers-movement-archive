It is part of our culture to be kind as well as forgiving, and not keep ill feelings towards each other. Michhami Dukkadam," tweeted the PM after Rahul Gandhi's comments that the BJP government under the PM had "undermined the powers of goddesses Lakshmi, Durga and Saraswati with its policies such as GST, note ban farm laws and J&K's bifurcation.Gandhi also said the symbol of the hand (Congress poll symbol) was visible in the pictures of Lord Mahavira, Guru Nanak, Lord Shiva and Allah.The PM later this evening tweeted an audio message saying, "The Jains celebrate Paryushan Parva in Bhadra month. The last day of this parv is the day of Samvatsari. It is a wonderful tradition. It is a festival of forgiveness, non-violence and friendship. It is also called Kshama vaani parva. We tell each other Michhami Dukkadam on this day.Our shastras also extol forgiveness as an ornament of the brave."The PM added that Mahatma Gandhi always used to say forgiveness is the quality of the strong. "In the Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare dwells on the importance of forgiveness and says that mercy is twice blessed. It blesses him that gives and him that takes. This means the one who forgives and the forgiven are both blessed," the PM said after the ruling BJP demanded an apology from Gandhi for "hurting Hindu sentiments by comparing GST with goddess Lakshmi having previously called GST gabbar Singh tax."Gandhi earlier today, while addressing Congress workers in Jammu, went on to draw comparisons between the Congress Party's election symbol "hand" and the blessing gestures of Guru Nanak, Allah, Lord Shiva and Lord Mahavira.“The BJP says it is religious, that it worships goddesses Lakshmi, Durga and Saraswati. Then why are they destroying the powers of Goddesses with their policies? The government attacked the composite culture of J&K. What happened when J&K was stripped of statehood? Was the power of goddesses enhanced or reduced? Now, I am speaking of power. The hand (Congress party’s election symbol) is seen in the pictures of Guru Nanak, Lord Shiva, Lord Mahavira, Allah,” Gandhi said.He also referred to the three goddesses as “symbols at Mata Vaishno Devi” (where he visited yesterday) saying, “The BJP has undermined the divine powers of goddesses with demonetisation and GST, reduced the powers of Goddess Durga by enacting farm laws and reduced the powers of goddess Saraswati by placing RSS people across institutions."The BJP hit back saying Gandhi's statements were immature and irresponsible and he needed to apologise for equating the Congress Party’s hand symbol with gods.“Rahul Gandhi after visiting Ma Vaisno Devi has played with the sentiments of the Hindus by saying that the powers of Goddess Durga, Saraswati and Lakshmi have decreased after Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power. He also said the “hand” of Congress is the hand of Wahe Guru. This indeed is hurting the sentiments of millions of Sikhs and Hindus across the world. Rahul Gandhi must apologise. He had the audacity of comparing GST with Mother Lakshmi after earlier calling GST Gabbar Singh Tax. This is unforgivable,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, blaming the Gandhi family for J&K's problems.The former Congress chief meanwhile cited MNREGA and high GDP growth under UPA to say the powers of goddess Lakshmi were enhanced under the Congress.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-extols-forgiveness-after-rahuls-goddesses-jibe-on-govt-309330

It is an event to mark the death anniversary of my elder brother (Ram Vilas Paswan). There is no question of not attending it. Whatever I am today, it is because of the blessing of my elder brother. Though I have blessings of the prime minister (Narendra Modi) as well,” he said, when asked if he would attend the event in Patna.Chirag Paswan, who has invited top national leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and Congress president Sonia Gandhi to the event, had gone to his uncle’s residence in Delhi on Tuesday to personally invite him to the programme.Until now, there was speculation as to whether Paras would attend the event being organised by Chirag Paswan or not as the latter is embroiled in a bitter dispute with Paras to claim the legacy of his late father.When asked if his decision to attend the September 12 event in Patna would somehow lead to ending of his differences with Chirag Paswan, Paras said, “Politics is one thing and the family matter is another. They are two different things”.                 “I am glad that Chirag came to my residence to personally invite me. He is my son, my nephew. However, there was no need for any invitation. I would have definitely gone to attend the event even without any invitation. It’s an event being organised to mark the death anniversary of my elder brother. Why wouldn’t I attend it?” he added.Paras said he has also planned to organise a mega event at his party office in Patna on October 8 to mark the first death anniversary of Ram Vilas Paswan.He said he will invite the prime minister, Union home minister, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and leaders of all political parties to attend the event. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pashupati-paras-to-attend-chirag-paswans-mega-event-on-his-fathers-death-anniversary-309328

In the past had compared the same with Gabbar Singh. This is unforgivable. Rahul has yet again done what he’s best at …immaturity and irresponsibility,” the saffron party claimed.The BJP said that there was a time when on behest of the Gandhi family the then PM of India, Dr Manmohan Singh, “even hugged separatist leaders”.“The problems of Jammu and Kashmir are the legacy of the Gandhi family. It was Jawaharlal Nehru who was responsible for the problems of Kashmir.“Ironically when Home Minister Amit Shah was discussing abrogation of Article 370, Leader of the Party (in the Lok Sabha) Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, said that it was a bilateral affair and should not be discussed without the mandate of Pakistan. This is the real nature of the Congress Party, shedding crocodile tears while it during its tenure destroyed Kashmir,” the BJP said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-slams-rahul-gandhi-pins-the-woes-of-kashmiri-pandits-on-appeasement-politics-of-congress-309324

Soybean oil, which constitutes around 25 per cent, is imported from Argentina and Brazil, and sunflower oil, which constitutes 19 per cent, mainly from UkraineIn case of palm oil (crude and refined), the imported quantity for August 2021 was 7.43 LMT as against 5.65 LMT in July 2021. The increase in August is 31.50 per cent from the previous month which is largely due to opening up of the economy, officials explain. The central government has already reduced import duties on crude and refined edible oils, including palm oil, to bring down retail prices. An inter-ministerial committee on agri commodities chaired by Secretary (Food) is also in place to closely monitor the prices and availability of agricultural commodities, including edible oil keeping in view the interest of the farmer, industry and consumers, they add.Production and availability of Soya seeds will improve from the Kharif season beginning October and other oilseeds as well by the coming Rabi season.Pandey said production and availability of Soya seeds will improve from the Kharif season beginning October and other oilseeds as well by the coming Rabi season. “This would also bring the prices of edible oils down”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/edible-oil-on-fire-food-secretary-asks-states-officials-to-check-unfair-practices-and-bring-transparency-309311

This was the second time Prime Minister Modi chaired the BRICS summit. Earlier, he had chaired the Goa summit in 2016.China will host the 14th BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) summit next year.Asked to comment on BRICS partnership and different agreements reached by the five-member bloc under India’s Presidency, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters here: “We recognise and appreciate India’s contributions during its chairmanship in the past year, including its hosting of this summit”.Chinese President Xi Jinping, who took part in the summit via video link on Thursday, said that during its Presidency next year, China looks forward to working with BRICS partners to deepen cooperation in all areas and build a closer and more results-oriented partnership to meet common challenges and create a better future.The summit was also attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.The theme of the summit was “Intra-BRICS cooperation for continuity, consolidation and consensus.” The summit this year coincided with the 15th anniversary of the BRICS.Elaborating on Xi’s address, Zhao highlighted the five proposals put forward by the Chinese President to advance the high-quality development of BRICS practical cooperation.Xi’s proposals included strengthening public health cooperation in the spirit of solidarity.The Chinese President said that BRICS countries need to support each other’s COVID-19 response, pursue practical cooperation on vaccines, including joint research and production and mutual recognition of standards, and facilitate an early launch of the BRICS Vaccine Research and Development Centre in a virtual format.Xi has also proposed to strengthen international cooperation on vaccines in the spirit of equitable access for all and said that China will donate an additional 100 million doses of vaccines to the developing countries within this year.He also suggested strengthening economic cooperation in the spirit of mutual benefit.China proposes to host a BRICS high-level meeting on climate change and a BRICS forum on big data for sustainable development, Xi said.“We welcome the substantive progress made in expanding the membership of the New Development Bank (NDB),” he said.He also proposed to strengthen political and security cooperation in the spirit of fairness and justice.“We need to consolidate the BRICS strategic partnership, support each other on issues concerning our respective core interests, better coordinate our position on major international and regional issues, and send out an even bigger, collective voice of BRICS countries,” the Chinese President said.Xi has proposed to strengthen people-to-people exchanges in the spirit of mutual learning.The BRICS bloc brings together five of the largest developing countries of the world, representing 41 per cent of the global population, 24 per cent of the global GDP and 16 per cent of the global trade.

10-09-2021||New Delhi||No dams in upper reaches of Ganga: Open letter to PM Modi||In an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as many as 64 prominent environmental activists and academicians, including two Rajya Sabha MPs, former RSS idealogue K N Govindacharya and historian Ram Guha, on Friday termed as a “profound error” and a “self-defeating exercise” the recommendation of going ahead with more hydro-electric projects (HEPs) in the upper reaches of the Ganga river in the Himalayas.Terming Ganga and the Himalayas as “pivotal ecological systems and defining symbols of Indian culture”, the activists, academics, historians and Parliamentarians reminded the Prime  Minister that six out of seven projects lie in the para-glacial zones or its buffers, which has been declared an inviolate area by environmental experts.The Open Letter recalls the sacrifices by several saints to ensure ‘nirmalta’ and ‘aviralta’ (clean and continuous flowing) Ganga and said, “Our collective ‘conscience’ and ‘science’  both demand that the decision to restart these seven projects be reversed, keeping in mind many factors that have been ignored, in the best interests of our nation and the stated goal of the government to rejuvenate the Ganga.”Those who have signed and endorsed the letter include Rajya Sabha member and coordinator for Indian Parliamentarians’ Forum for Ganga and Himalayas, Kunwar Rewati Raman Singh and another  RS member, Pradip Tamta from Uttarakhand; retired Allahabad High Court judge and Chancellor Benaras Hindu University, Justice Giridhar Malviya; former RSS idealogue K N Govindacharya; historian Ram Guha; retired Kumaon University professor Padmashree Shekhar Pathak; environmentalist who chaired the Supreme Court appointed experts’ body on the ‘Impact of Hydropower Projects’ Dr Ravi Chopra; Stockholm Water Award winner and Tarun Bharat Sangh’s founder Rajendra Singh; NGO Ganga Ahvaan’s Mallika Bhanot; Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan’s Manoj Mishra and former Secretary, Water Resources Ministry, Shashi Shekhar. Others include activists, academics and think tank members from Uttarakhand and from across India.Eight years after the Supreme Court moratorium on dam construction in the Upper Ganga region, three Union Ministries and the Uttarakhand government had reached a “consensus” to allow construction of seven hydropower projects, including the one destroyed in the February 2021 flash floods in Chamoli district.The seven projects are the 1,000 MW Tehri stage II project, 520 MW Tapovan Vishnugad project, 444 MW Vishnugad Pipalkote project, 99 MW Singholi Bhatwari project, 76 MW Phata Buyong project, 15 MW Madhmaheshwar project, and 4.5 MW Kaliganga II project.Earlier last month, the Ministries of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Jal Shakti, Power and the state had together reached a consensus on the seven projects to be implemented,  according to an affidavit filed by Joint Secretary, Environment, Forests and Climate Change Sujit Kumar Bajpayee ten days ago in connection with an ongoing case regarding dam projects in Uttarakhand post the 2013 disaster which had witnessed over 5,000 deaths, damage to property and infrastructure projects.Chalking out the disastrous chronology in the Uttarakhand Himalayas one example at a time and showcasing how it has been the hydropower projects that are at the root of these events,  the letter sought to remind the Prime Minister of the PMO’s “welcome and judicious” decision in its meeting of February 25, 2019 that a) No new hydro-electric project shall be taken up on River Ganga and its tributaries in Uttarakhand and b) All projects in which the work has not started on the ground shall be dropped.The same PMO meeting had also said that considering the revenue and opportunity lost to the state of Uttarakhand, it may be compensated for the projects, which are being dropped and on which work has already started.Not just this, the activists also reminded the Prime Minister of the observation of the Jal Shakti ministry itself: “As may be seen from the views of experts and expert organizations indicated in the foregoing para, the HEPs will adversely affect the ecology of the Himalayas, leading to an irreversible loss to the Himalayan eco system and to the national river Ganga which is the nation’s identity and symbol of faith and heritage.” The letter ended with saying that they “sincerely hope” that the Prime Minister will reconsider the recent MoEF&CC recommendation to restart the construction of the seven HEPs. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-dams-in-upper-reaches-of-ganga-open-letter-to-pm-modi-309298

Its channel head Hemant Golani had on Wednesday said that raids were being conducted in the premises of VTV NEWS.The CBDT said “incriminating” documents and loose sheets were recovered by the raid teams.“A majority of these pieces of evidence indicate huge unaccounted cash receipts in excess of Rs 500 crore on the sale of transferable development right certificates. Evidence of on-money transactions in real estate projects and land deals, in excess of Rs 350 crore, have also been found along with corroborative documents,” it said.The statement said that “incriminating evidence of unaccounted cash-based loan and interest payments/repayments worth more than Rs 150 crore have also been found”.It claimed that substantial incriminating pieces of evidence of unaccounted cash expenses, cash advances received and interest paid in cash have also been unearthed.The CBDT, which frames policy for the tax department, said a large number of original documents of properties of the group acquired over the years and held in the names of several “dummy” individuals and cooperative housing societies were found. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/found-over-rs-1k-crore-unaccounted-transactions-cbdt-after-raids-on-gujarati-media-real-estate-group-309297
10-09-2021||Chandigarh||Doctors document IAF’s first Covid-19 air evacuation, suggest modifications in equipment and procedures||Documenting the first ever air evacuation of a Covid-19 patient by the IAF, doctors have highlighted the unique challenges faced in carrying out the task and suggested certain modifications in the existing equipment and procedures.A 54-year-old male healthcare worker diagnosed with Covid-19 was required to be transported from Air Force Hospital, Jorhat, in the northeast to a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi after his condition deteriorated sharply, which involved a flying time of around four hours. Though air evacuation of patients is a routine activity in the Indian Air Force (IAF), evacuation of a patient seriously infected with Covid-19 created a unique and unprecedented situation as the patient was required to be isolated due to the highly contagious nature of the disease and had the potential of infecting the medical team as well as aircrew.Further, the experience and available literature on evacuating such a case was almost minimal and the guidelines and triage had not been laid down.Stringent measures were required to be ensured during pre-flight, in-flight as well as post-flight phase to prevent any possibility of deterioration of patient condition.The selection of an aircraft was also important as distance to be covered by a patient on life support system required high cruising speed, well pressurized and inbuilt power pack up system for medical equipment. A C-130 Super Hercules four-engine turbo-prop was chosen for the mission.The patient was placed in an airborne rescue pod for isolated transportation (ARPIT), put on non-invasive ventilator (NIV) and all vital parameters were continuously monitored. The patient was donned with a PPE kit and advised to communicate through hand gestures with the team.During the flight all measures were ensured to maintain the SpO2 level and other medical parameters within satisfactory levels by the critical care air ambulance team. The NIV battery got discharged after two hours and it connected to the direct power supply of the aircraft.The patient remained stable during the flight, but certain limitations were experienced with the ARPIT, according to the paper published in the latest issue of Indian Journal of Aerospace Medicine by four doctors posted at the Air Force Hospital, Jorhat.Being enclosed in the isolation pod gives a claustrophobic feeling and there is minimal scope for active intervention by the medical staff. Patients are required to lie down inside the pop, thus complicating the oxygen perfusion. Space constraint also does not permit any change of position or movement by the patient, which is desirable as part of thromboprophylaxis measures. The authors also pointed out that there was difficulty in placing even simple monitoring equipment such as pulse oximetre and ECG through the isolation pod and it would have been very difficult to remove the pod’s canopy to manage the patient in case of any in-flight emergency.Changes in the ARPIT’s dimensions and shape to allow a patient to be positioned in a semi-reclining position, appropriately sized and placed ports to introduce monitoring devices and back up batteries for equipment are among suggestions put forth by the authors.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doctors-document-iafs-first-covid-19-air-evacuation-suggest-modifications-in-equipment-and-procedures-309295
10-09-2021||Jammu||RSS, BJP trying to break J&K’s composite culture: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused the RSS-BJP combine of trying to break the composite culture of Jammu and Kashmir.“The feeling of love, brotherhood and composite culture exists among you all. I feel sad that the RSS and BJP are trying to break this culture,” Gandhi said in his address to Congress office-bearers and workers at a party function here on the second day of his two-day visit to Jammu.Also read: BJP slams Rahul Gandhi, pins the woes of Kashmiri Pandits on ‘appeasement politics’ of Congress“They (RSS, BJP) attack love and brotherhood… You got weakened and as result, they took away your statehood,” he added.The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is the ideological fountainhead of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government at the Centre.The Congress leader exhorted the gathering to chant ‘Jai Mata Di’, a day after he paid obeisance at the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine in Katra.“I went to Mata Vaishno Devi shrine yesterday. There are three symbols of mata (pindis) there — Mata Durga, Mata Lakshmi and Mata Saraswati,” Gandhi said.Goddess Durga protects us, Lakshmi is a symbol of power, and Saraswati symbolises education and knowledge, he said.“When these three shaktis are in your home and country, your home and country will make progress,” he said.However, the BJP government’s policies like demonetisation and GST have weakened their powers, he said.Whereas, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and the GDP with a growth rate of 9 per cent under the Congress had increased their powers, he added.Pointing towards his hand, Gandhi co-related the Congress election symbol with Lord Shiva and Guru Nanak Dev, and said it was the symbol of being fearless.“This hand is the symbol that you should not be afraid of anything,” Gandhi said, adding that the “BJP is afraid of everything”. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-bjp-trying-to-break-jks-composite-culture-rahul-gandhi-309292
10-09-2021||New Delhi||Indian states surpass top nations on daily Covid dose delivery, PM reviews vaccination status||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday took a high-level review meeting to understand the status of India’s Covid-19 infection and inoculation even as several states crossed new milestones on Friday by managing to deliver more average daily Covid shots than some of the top foreign countries.Days after India showed it could deliver more Covid 19 doses than the G7 block put together through August, fresh global data on inoculations showed the average daily doses administered by Uttar Pradesh are more than the daily average doses being given by the US.Where UP is giving 11.73 lakh average doses daily, the US is giving 8.07 lakh.Likewise, Haryana is delivering more average daily shots (1.52 lakh) than Canada (0.85 lakh).Gujarat with 4,80 lakh average daily dose administration is similarly outpacing Mexico with 4.56 lakh average daily shots.Karnataka is giving 3.62 lakh average daily doses as against 3.68 lakh in Russia.Madhya Pradesh is ahead of France on the parameter and is delivering 3.71 lakh average daily doses as against 2.84 lakh in France.In a major expansion of the Covid vaccination drive, as many as 78.09 lakh doses were administered daily in the first week of September, as against 20 lakh in May and 59.19 lakh in August.PM Modi reviewed the status of daily positivity in India and also the situation in the districts of concern.Although the weekly positivity rate nationally has been stable below 3 pper cent for the tenth week, 35 districts still have more than 10 percent positivity and 30 districts have positivity between 5 and 10 pc.Lahaul and Spiti and Mandi in Himachal besides all 14 Kerala districts are among the 35 districts with 10 plus positivity, where restrictions are being recommended by the Centre.The PM advised officers to further expand vaccinations in the wake of the festive season after ICMR showed 97.5 per cent protection from death following two doses and 96.6 per cent after one dose.Health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on Friday that six crore doses had been given in May and so far over six crore doses have already been given in September. We should sing praises of the successes of our national inoculation drive, Bhushan said.India this Sunday breached a significant global milestone in Covid-19 vaccine delivery by administering more doses to its population through the month of August than all the developed G 7 nations put together.The health ministry data show that India administered 180 million doses in August, as against Canada’s 3 million, UK’s 5 million, Germany’s 9 million, France 13 million, US 23 million, Japan 40 million.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-states-surpass-top-nations-on-daily-covid-dose-delivery-pm-reviews-vaccination-status-309291

This is Modi-Yogi rule,” said Shalabh Mani Tripathi, the Media Adviser of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Along with the tweet in Hindi, he tagged media reports of the development.Established in 2006, the university is run by the Mohammad Ali Jauhar Trust. Samajwadi Party MP Azam Khan is the president of the trust and the Chancellor of the university, which had run into trouble over allegations of irregularities and land encroachment.Khan and his son Abdullah, who is also an active member of the trust, are currently lodged in the Sitapur jail.Citing the SDM’s report, the Allahabad High Court said a mosque was constructed over the land which was only for educational purposes. Thus, it is a violation of the permission granted by the state government.In 2005, the then Samajwadi Party government enacted the Mohammad Ali Jauhar University Act, paving the way for the creation of the university.Thereafter, the state government granted permission to the Trust to acquire 400 acres of land against the ceiling of 12.5 acres for the establishment of the University while imposing certain conditions, one of which was that the land will be used only for educational purposes.According to law, if such a condition is violated, the permission granted by the state government stands withdrawn.

10-09-2021||Kolkata||Mamata files nomination for Bhabanipur, TMC says will avenge Nandigram defeat||Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee on Friday filed her nomination for the September 30 Bhabanipur assembly by-poll winning which is an absolute necessity for her to continue as the chief minister.She will be pitted against BJP’s Priyanka Tibrewal and Left Front’s Srijib Biswas. The Congress has decided not to field a candidate against her.The votes for Bhabanipur as also Jangipur and Samserganj will be counted on October 3 and results declared the same day.Banerjee was accompanied by the wife of state cabinet minister Firhad Hakim at Survey Building in Alipore where she filed her nomination papers.She was later seen greeting people with folded hands before boarding her car.“The people of Bhabanipur are eagerly waiting to rewrite history by ensuring Mamata Banerjee’s victory by a record margin. They are waiting to avenge the conspiracy that was hatched to defeat Mamata di at Nandigram,” Firhad Hakim told reporters.TMC supporters lustily cheered their leader with slogans like “Bhabanipur Nijer Ghorer Meyekei chai” (Bhabanipur wants her own daughter) and “Bhabanipur eh Khela Hobe” (Game will happen in Bhabanipur).“For us, the challenge is not victory as we are confident about it. The challenge is to ensure Didi’s win by a record margin,” another TMC worker said.Banerjee, a resident of Bhabanipur, had won the seat twice in 2011 and 2016 but shifted to Nandigram, where the anti-farmland acquisition movement against the Left Front government had transformed her into a major political force in the volatile state, to dare her former protégé and now a BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari on his home turf. Though Banerjee powered the TMC to a resounding win for a third straight term in office, she lost in Nandigram.She now must win Bhabanipur to ensure an unbroken stint as the chief minister.Banerjee is required to win a seat in the state assembly by November 5 in conformity with the constitutional provisions in order to continue as chief minister. The Constitution allows a non-member of a state legislature or Parliament to continue in a ministerial position without getting elected only for six months.After her defeat in Nandigram, Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, state cabinet minister and TMC MLA from Bhabanipur, vacated the seat to facilitate her return to the assembly from there.Reacting to her nomination, West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said she will face the same fate as in Nandigram.“The BJP had defeated her in Nandigram. She will be defeated again in Bhabanipur. The people of the constituency will give her a befitting reply for the torture and violence her party unleashed after the assembly polls,” he said.Banerjee was first elected to the Assembly in a by-poll from Bhabanipur months after the TMC stormed to power ousting the 34-year-old Left Front dispensation in 2011.She represented South Kolkata Lok Sabha seat, of which Bhabanipur is a segment, six times. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-files-nomination-for-bhabanipur-tmc-says-will-avenge-nandigram-defeat-309278

This story is no less than a movie plot. The incident was reported at Sakleshpur taluk of Hassan district in Karnataka.As per News 18, the story began a year ago when a 27-year-old man from a village in Sakleshpur bumped into a 20-year-old woman from a neighbouring village and started dating her. Six months later, he met another woman from another village and a ‘friendship’ blossomed. He would regularly meet both the women.However, the women were not aware that the man was two-timing them.Trouble began when the man was spotted with a woman by a relative who informed his father.The family confronted him about the woman. He said he was in love with her and wanted to marry her.The family disagreed and decided to fix his wedding with someone else.When one of the women learnt about this she told her family that she wanted to marry him.The woman’s family visited the man’s house and spoke about the affair that they learnt from their daughter.Meanwhile, the other woman also got to know what was going on and her family also ended up at the man’s house. Seeing both the women, the man’s parents were in a fix. By then, the entire village had learnt about the love triangle.A panchayat was called and both the women offered long arguments. But the man didn’t say a word. The panchayat was unable to decide. Struck by grief that she was being cheated, the first woman tried to commit suicide by consuming poison. Luckily, she was saved in time.On September 4, a second panchayat was called. Families of the man and both women were present. A lawyer was also called to draw an agreement on a stamp paper for all three parties stating that the panchayat’s decision would be final. Also, nobody will either go to police, court or media even if the decision was not in their favour. All three parties agreed.It was solemnly decided that the panchayat will flip a coin to decide which woman should marry the man. Until that moment, the man didn’t express his wish or discuss his decision whatsoever. Now, there are two versions about what happened in the panchayat though both point to the same conclusion.The first version says the toss played in favour of the first woman (the one who tried to commit suicide) and the man readily agreed to marry her. There is a second version which says the man finally made a decision and chose the first woman who was ready to die when she learnt she couldn’t marry him.Once that decision was made, the man moved towards the woman and hugged her before the panchayat.But the other woman, who was a mere spectator to all this, came forward, wished the woman luck but slapped and warned the man before leaving the place.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-2-women-want-to-marry-the-same-man-karnataka-panchayat-proposes-a-toss-to-decide-the-matter-309250

10-09-2021||Lucknow||Mayawati says BSP won't field 'bahubali', mafia candidates; no Mukhtar Ansari from Mau||The BSP will make efforts to not field ‘bahubali’ (strongmen) or mafia candidates in next year’s Uttar Pradesh polls, party chief Mayawati said on Friday, announcing that jailed gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari will not be renominated by the party from Mau.Soon after her statement, Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM, which has announced to contest 100 seats, offered Ansari a ticket, with its spokesperson Syed Asim Waqar telling PTI that “our doors are open for him”.Mayawati said BSP state president Bhim Rajbhar will contest from Mau, currently represented by Mukhtar Ansari, the five-term MLA who was brought back from Punjab’s Ropar jail in April and lodged in a Banda jail.Her announcement comes days after Mukhtar Ansari’s brother Sigbatullah joined the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party.“In upcoming assembly polls, the BSP’s effort will be to not field ‘bahubali’ and mafia elements. So, the name of Bhim Rajbhar, the BSP UP president, has been finalised from the Mau assembly seat in place of Mukhtar Ansari,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.The statement also follows her remarks on Tuesday during her party’s “Prabuddha Varga Sammelan” that she would no longer focus on building statues and memorials—something her party was criticised for during her previous terms—and rather concentrate on changing the face of Uttar Pradesh by establishing rule of law.Mayawati’s two announcements signal her efforts to build a new perception of her Bahujan Samaj Party among people.Mukhtar’s another brother, Afzal Ansari, is a BSP MP, who represents the Ghazipur seat. He had defeated the BJP’s Manoj Sinha, who is now the Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. Afzal Ansari could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.Mayawati on Friday also said the decision to not field criminal and mafia elements has been taken to meet people’s expectation, and appealed to party leaders to keep this in mind while choosing candidates. “So that there is no problem in taking strict action against such elements once the government is formed.”       She added, “Alongside ensuring ‘a rule of law, by law’, the BSP’s resolve is to also change Uttar Pradesh’s image now.”                She said the BSP’s should be known as the government that follows the philosophy of ‘Sarvajan Hitay and Sarvajan Sukhay’ (universal good).Meanwhile, AIMIM spokesperson Syed Asim Waqar said his party was ready to welcome Mukhtar Ansari if he wants to contest election. “AIMIM’s doors are open for him. We will give him a ticket and ensure his victory also,” he told PTI.He said that not only Mukhtar, he asks other Muslims also to not “purchase tickets” from any political party as they will take money and make sure they do not win.“I ask Muslims who want to contest elections to come and join the AIMIM and the party will give tickets to them,” he said.Muslims are in a position to influence results in 84 of the total 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh. The AIMIM aims to harness this advantage. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mayawati-says-bsp-wont-field-bahubali-mafia-candidates-no-mukhtar-ansari-from-mau-309244

As witnessed from the deplorable terrorist attack at Kabul airport last month, terrorism continues to pose a serious threat to Afghanistan. It is, therefore, important that commitments made in this regard are respected and adhered to,” Tirumurti said.

10-09-2021||New Delhi||Jyotiraditya Scindia: Need to rationalise tax rates on ATF||Emphasising the need to rationalise tax rates on jet fuel, Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia today said lower rates would bring in more flights and act as an economic multiplier that would be “50 to 100 times more” than what states earned from a low level of revenue from Value Added Tax (VAT).Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) cost is a significant component of the operational expenses of carriers and the ministry has been pitching for lower rates to boost the airline industry.“A certain state may collect as little as one per cent VAT on the ATF, while another state can charge up to 30 per cent. Tax rates must be rationalised if we want to promote the aviation sector. The states which have the foresight to keep VAT rates low are attracting more carriers,” he told the media here today.Scindia further said he had written to CMs of 29 states and flagged the matter. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jyotiraditya-scindia-need-to-rationalise-tax-rates-on-atf-308966

10-09-2021||New Delhi||Cannot order for use of traditional remedies like ‘Red Ant Chutney’ as cure for Covid-19: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday said that it cannot direct for use of traditional knowledge or home remedies as a cure of COVID-19 for whole of country and dismissed a plea seeking direction for use of ‘Red Ant Chutney’ as cure for the deadly virus.“You see there is a lot of traditional knowledge, even in our homes we have traditional knowledge. These remedies you can have for your own consumption facing the consequence, if any on yourself but we cannot ask for applying this traditional knowledge across the country,” a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli said.Asking petitioner Nayadhar Padhial, a member of tribal community of Odisha to get vaccinated for Covid, the bench dismissed the plea.Advocate Anirudha Sanganeria, appearing for the petitioner, said that the Orissa High Court dismissed the plea and they have challenged the order.The bench said, “The problem started with the High Court directing the director general of Ayush ministry and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to take within three months a decision on a proposal to use red ant chutney as a remedy for Covid-19. We want to put an end to it”.It said, “We are not inclined to entertain the Special Leave Petition under Article 136 of the Constitution. The Special Leave Petition is accordingly dismissed.”The petition said Red ant chutney, a mixture of red ants and green chillies, is traditionally considered as a medicine in the tribal belts of the country including Odisha and Chhattisgarh for a cure of flu, cough, common cold, fatigue, breathing problems and other ailments.The petitioner claimed that the “Red Ant Chutney” has a medicinal value as it contains formic acid, protein, calcium, Vitamin B12 and Zinc and its efficacy needs to be ascertained as a cure of Covid-19.In his plea filed through Sanganeria, the petitioner said he is a resident of Odisha and belongs to a tribal community, namely “Bathudi” by caste and has moved the High Court on his sincere belief that the “Red Ant Chutney” could be used effectively to boost the immunity system and would go a long way ahead to prevent the infection of Covid-19 virus.Padhial said on December 24, last year the high court had directed CSIR and the Ministry of AYUSH to evaluate the claims and subsequently after the representations were made to both authorities, the claim was rejected.“Constrained by the rejection of the representation without proper research and study, the Petitioner filed another Writ Petition before the High Court and prayed for referring the matter to another body of experts”, he said.He said that the High Court rejected his plea while observing that since the CSIR and AYUSH Ministry have not preferred to recommend the claim of the Petitioner to another body of experts, the Court which is not an expert on this subject should not recommend it to the body of experts.He contended that the High Court erred in law in not exercising its writ jurisdiction for evaluating a localized treatment when in a similar case; the Madras High Court had issued directions and appointed a body of experts for evaluating a localized treatment of COVID-9 in the state of Tamil Nadu.Padhial said that the High Court erred in law to consider that Right to Health is guaranteed under the Constitution and it ought to have directed the Respondents to verify his claims especially when he had on record the immunity properties of the Red Ant Chutney through Scientific Peer-Reviewed Journals.

We first looked at deaths which is what most people are interested in and vaccines are definitively averting serious disease and death,” the ICMR DG said.Data further reveal that death among the non-vaccinated segment is high while mortality rate after two doses is nearly zero.Member Health NITI Aayog noted, “When you give two doses there is near total protection from severe disease and death. Our vaccines give up to 96 per cent protection from death. It’s clear that vaccines are the most important shield against death. This will change the scenario dramatically.”As of today India had administered over 72 crore doses with 58 pc people above 18 years covered with one dose.The government experts have called for expanded vaccination and for left out people to get inoculated on priority.Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan reminded people today that the second wave was not over and although the weekly positivity rate has been below 3 pc for the tenth week, 35 districts still have more than 10 percent positivity and 30 districts have a positivity rate between 5 and 10 pc.Lahaul and Spiti and Mandi in Himachal are among the districts of concern with Lahaul’s positivity a high of 13.74 pc.No criteria to jab kids for reopening schools: VK PaulMember Health NITI Aayog today said vaccinating children is not criteria for schools anywhere globally but inoculating teachers, staffers and parents of children was critical.
