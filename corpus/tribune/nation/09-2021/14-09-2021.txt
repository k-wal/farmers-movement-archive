Now, a team led by ecologist Uma Ramakrishnan and her student Vinay Sagar from the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore, have discovered that the coat colouration and patterning that make the wild cats appear dark boil down to a single mutation in the Transmembrane Aminopeptidase Q (Taqpep) gene.“Ours is the first and only study to investigate the genetic basis for this phenotype (look). While the phenotype has been talked about and written about earlier, this is the first time its genetic underpinnings were scientifically investigated,” Ramkrishnan, professor at NCBS, told PTI.The researchers combined genetic analyses of other tiger populations from India and data from computer simulations to show that the Similipal black tigers may have arisen from a very small founding population of tigers and are inbred, providing an answer to the question that had perplexed so many.The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, noted that tigers in the Similipal Tiger Reserve are an isolated population in eastern India, and gene flow between them and other tiger populations is very restricted.The researchers noted that this has important implications for tiger conservation as such isolated and inbred populations are prone to extinction over even short periods of time.“They (the black tigers) have not been found in any other places in the wild to the best of our knowledge. Nowhere else in the world,” Sagar, a PhD student in Ramakrishan’s lab and lead author of the paper, told PTI.“We used whole genome sequencing from a pedigree (family tree) that includes pseudomelanistic (false coloured) and normally striped individuals to find the mutation responsible for the phenotype,” he explained.The abnormally dark or black coat in such tigers is termed pseudomelanistic or false coloured. The most recent sightings of this rare mutant tiger in Similipal, long considered mythical, was reported in 2017 and 2018.Since the late 1700s, reports of black tiger sightings and supposed captures in central and northeast India have been recorded by locals and British hunters.“There are several camera trap pictures. In fact, camera trapping was carried out in 2021 in Similipal,”  Ramakrishnan told PTI.According to the 2018 tiger census, India has an estimated 2,967 tigers. Photos captured from Similipal in 2018 showed eight unique individuals, three of which were ‘pseudomelanistic’ tigers, characterised by wide, merged stripes.The researchers at NCBS teamed up with tiger experts nationally and in other countries and found out that pseudomelanistic coat came down to the genes.They found the black tigers are mutants and are Bengal tigers with a single base mutation.Different mutations in this gene are known to cause similar changes in coat colour in several other species of cats, including cheetahs.The drastic change in patterning and colouring of the black tigers’ coat is caused by just one change in the genetic material DNA Alphabet from C (Cytosine) to T (Thymine) in position 1360 of the Taqpep gene sequence, the researchers said.Further genetic analyses and comparisons with a total of 395 captive and wild Indian tiger populations indicates that the mutation in Similipal tigers is very rare.The only other black tigers outside of Similipal in India exist at the Nandankanan Zoological Park in Bhubaneswar, Ranchi Zoo and Chennai’s Arignar Anna Zoological Park, where they were born in captivity.Genetic tracing proved that these captive-born tigers shared a common ancestry with Similipal tigers.Within Similipal, the mutation is present at a high frequency of 0.58: this means that if you pick any tiger from Similipal, the chance that it carries the mutant gene is almost 60 per cent. The researchers also carried out investigations to understand why this mutation occurred at such a high frequency in Similipal alone.One hypothesis is that the darker coat colour of the mutants offers them a selective advantage when hunting in the dense closed-canopy and relatively darker forested areas of Similipal as compared to the open plains of most other tiger habitats.However, the results of additional genetic analyses coupled with computer simulations indicate that a small founding population and prolonged isolation from other tiger populations in India is likely to be the main reason for the occurrence of these black tigers.Due to this geographic isolation, genetically related individuals have been mating with each other for many generations in Similipal, leading to inbreeding, the researchers noted.A combination of these interrelated factors are the likely evolutionary forces that have created Similipal’s unique population of black tigers.“It is amazing that we could find the genetic basis for such a striking pattern phenotype in wild tigers, and even more interesting that this genetic variant is at high frequencies in Similipal,” said Ramakrishnan.“This appears to be a classic example of a founding event, which is followed by a small population that is isolated. As a result, this pseudomelanitic phenotype has become very common here,”  Sagar added.The research also included scientists from Stanford University, HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, both in the US, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Tirupati, Center  for Cellular & Molecular Biology, Hyderabad , and Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun.

14-09-2021||Kochi||Kerala HC allows man’s plea for DNA test of child to establish wife’s infidelity||The Kerala High Court on Tuesday allowed a man’s plea for the DNA test of a child born during the subsistence of his marriage to establish his allegations of infidelity against his wife in the divorce proceedings initiated by him.The high court answered in the affirmative the question before it—whether a direction be given for DNA test of a child in divorce proceedings to establish the husband’s claim of infidelity by the wife without the minor being a party in the case.The court said that such a direction can be issued only if the person seeking the DNA test has made out a strong prima facie to support his claims.In the instant case, the husband had claimed that he was married on May 5, 2006 and the child was born on March 9, 2007, but as he was employed in military service, he had left for Ladakh 22 days after the wedding.He claimed that during those 22 days and thereafter, there was no physical relationship between them due to the non-cooperation of his wife.He had also alleged that his wife was living an adulterous life with her brother-in-law (her sister’s husband).The man submitted that since he was suffering from infertility, there was no possibility for him to have a child and in support of his claim he had produced an infertility certificate, which said that he suffered from oligoasthenoteratospermia—a condition that includes low sperm number, low sperm motility and abnormal sperm morphology - the commonest cause of male infertility.“The doctor gave evidence that there is no possibility for the petitioner (husband) to have the child. The doctor further deposed that before issuing the certificate, the semen test of the petitioner was conducted.This is a strong prima facie circumstance in support of the case of the petitioner that he is not the biological father of the child,” the high court noted.It also noted that when the Family Court at Nedumangad passed an order for the DNA test on the husband’s request, during the wife’s plea seeking maintenance for the child, she had failed to comply with the direction.“This is yet another strong prima facie circumstance,” the high court said.“For all these reasons, we are of the view that the petitioner has made out a strong prima facie case to order a DNA test. DNA testing is the most authentic and scientifically proven means to establish paternity and thereby, prove the case of infidelity and adultery set up by the petitioner,” the high court added.The court also held that in a petition filed by the husband seeking dissolution of marriage alleging adultery or infidelity on the part of the wife, by disputing the paternity of the child born during the subsistence of their marriage, the minor is not a necessary party.“In such a petition, the court can order a DNA test to establish the husband’s assertion of infidelity and adultery on the part of the wife without the child in the party array if a strong prima facie case is made out,” it said.With the observation, the high court set aside the lower court’s order dismissing the husband’s plea for a DNA test of the child.The lower court had not granted his request for the reason that the child was not a party to the proceedings and when he sought to make the minor a party, it declined that plea as well on the ground that it was barred by time.Allowing the husband’s appeal, the high court directed that the DNA test be conducted at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology at Thiruvananthapuram. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-hc-allows-mans-plea-for-dna-test-of-child-to-establish-wifes-infidelity-311104
14-09-2021||United Nations/Geneva||India expresses disappointment over ‘unwarranted remarks’ by UN human rights chief on Kashmir||India on Tuesday expressed disappointment over “unwarranted remarks” made by the UN human rights chief on Jammu and Kashmir, saying her comments do not reflect the ground reality and any shortcomings in upholding human rights must be addressed in an impartial manner and anchored in non-interference in a country’s internal affairs.“We take note of references to India in the oral update by the High Commissioner and express our disappointment over her unwarranted remarks on the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, which do not reflect the ground reality,” Secretary (West) in the Ministry of External Affairs Reenat Sandhu said on Tuesday while delivering India’s statement under the General Debate on Oral Update of the High Commissioner at the 48th Session of the Human Rights Council.Sandhu said India’s approach to global promotion and protection of human rights is based on “our own experience as a pluralistic and inclusive society and vibrant democracy.”               She said India believes that promotion and protection of human rights are best pursued through dialogue, consultation and cooperation among States and through provision of technical assistance and capacity building.“Any shortcomings in upholding human rights must be addressed in a transparent and impartial manner, anchored in respect for national sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs of States,” she said.UN high commissioner for human rights Michelle Bachelet on Monday described as “worrying” India’s use of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act as well as “frequent” temporary communication blackouts in Jammu and Kashmir.In her opening statement at the 48th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Bachelet acknowledged the Indian government’s efforts to counter terrorism and promote development in Jammu and Kashmir but said such “restrictive measures can result in human rights violations and foster further tensions and discontent”.Sandhu said that India’s Constitution enshrines basic human rights as fundamental rights. “Our Parliament, independent judiciary, vibrant media and civil society ensure full enjoyment of human rights by our people,” she added.On Afghanistan, Sandhu said the situation in the country continues to be of “grave concern” and added that the UN Security resolution 2593 should guide the international community’s approach to Afghanistan.The resolution, adopted under India’s presidency of the Security Council in August, “reaffirms the importance of upholding human rights incising those of women, children and minorities, allowing safe passage for those wanting to leave Afghanistan and ensuring unhindered access for humanitarian assistance,” she said, adding that the international community must stand with the people of Afghanistan in their desire to live in peace and dignity.The UNSC resolution, adopted on August 30 under India’s presidency of the global body, talked about the need for upholding human rights in Afghanistan, demanded that Afghan territory should not be used for terrorism and that a negotiated political settlement should be found out to the crisis.“India has been at the forefront of global action and discourse on promotion and protection of human rights and will continue to do so. We are seeking re-election to the Human Rights Council for the term 2022-24. We look forward to the continued support of the UN member states to India’s candidature,” Sandhu said.

But he could not save the state government from embarrassment in the high court in several cases in the past. So, perhaps, he was forced to resign,” BJP MP Arjun Singh said.Reacting to Singh’s comment, Trinamool Congress Deputy Leader in Rajya Sabha Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said, “We didn’t have the slightest idea that Arjun Singh is so knowledgeable about happenings in the judiciary.”              He said Dutta resigned on personal grounds and wondered why no question is asked when any top official in the union government resigns.

Shifting to the new accommodation is meant to happen by April 30, 2022.However, the FMC, in principle, agreed to roll out the provisional allotment independent of the scheme enlisted in the affidavit regarding allotment of premises/houses in lieu of rehabilitation of eligible applicant(s) after a Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar raised certain questions regarding the timeframe proposed by the corporation.It asked the FMC to give provisional accommodation to the dwellers in state flats after provisional scrutiny which will be subject to the final adjudication and final draw of lots.“Needless to observe that on taking possession of provisional/temporary accommodation, the rent/solatium of Rs 2,000 per month offered to the concerned applicant(s) shall stand discontinued on case-to-case basis,” the Bench said.The court said that upon receipt of applications duly accompanied by documents prime facie establishing eligibility for rehabilitation, the civic body shall issue provisional allotment within a week after due scrutiny and the letter shall indicate that it is only temporary and subject to verification and final draw of lot.“The corporation shall, upon receipt of application duly accompanied by documents prime facie establishing eligibility for rehabilitation, issue provisional allotment to such applicants within one week from the receipt of application after due scrutiny,” it said.Top court would further hear the matter on next Monday.The top court had on June 7 ordered the Haryana Government and the Faridabad Municipal Corporation to remove “all encroachments”, consisting around 10,000 residential constructions, in Aravali forest area near the village, saying “land grabbers cannot take refuge in rule of law and talk of fairness”. It had also sought a compliance report from state government officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/khori-demolition-faridabad-mc-agrees-to-roll-out-provisional-allotment-for-oustees-311097

These included flying operations involved in rehearsing of war plans and implementation of operational instructions inclusive of international exercises, all combat and tactical sorties in preparation of war, valley flying and missions involving operating at ultra low levels, all operational missions undertaken during peace like special operations, live operational readiness platform, recce, intelligence, survey and induction trials of new weapons, missions undertaken in support of troops and security forces deployed in forward areas, and lastly, flying missions involving landings on advance landing grounds.The ministry’s letter of September 9, 2009, which had specified these categories, explicitly stated that “cases already settled prior to the date of issue of this letter will not be reopened.”A memorandum issued by the Department of Ex-servicemen Welfare earlier this month states that the matter has been examined in the ministry and it has been decided that the flying accidents cases that occurred on or after January 1, 1996, the date of implementation of the Fifth Pay Commission, and which fall strictly under the six aforementioned categories, may also be considered for grant of pensionary benefits.“Service Headquarter /Record Offices concerned are advised to re-examine each such case strictly in accordance with six categories mentioned above in consultation with the Principal Controller of Defence Accounts without any deviation,” the memorandum says.Between 1996 and 2009, dozens of armed forces fighter and transport aircraft as well as helicopters were involved in accidents, in which aircrew as well as passengers had lost their lives. This included operations in conflict zones such as Kargil as well as war like situations such Operational Parakram and Siachen, besides training exercises.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pensionary-benefits-in-cases-of-aircraft-accidents-extended-to-cover-all-post-1996-cases-311080

Instigation can be inferred where the accused had, by his acts or omission created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide,” the Bench said.The top court said that in the instant case, the allegation against the appellant is that there was a quarrel on the day of occurrence; however, there is no other material on record which indicates abetment.“There is no material on record that the appellant-accused played an active role by an act of instigating the deceased to facilitate the commission of suicide. On the contrary, in the present case, even the appellant-accused also tried to commit suicide and consumed pesticide.“Under the circumstances and in the facts and circumstances of the case and there is no other material on record which indicates abetment, both the High Court as well as the trial Court have committed an error in convicting the accused for the offence under Section 306 IPC,” the Bench said.

Police also claimed to have seized a revolver from her car after the arrest.On September 6, Sharma was produced before the Ambajogai sessions court, which sent her to 14-day judicial custody. She later filed for bail.Ashok Kulkarni, public prosecutor, said the hearing on Sharma’s bail petition was slated for Tuesday.However, the investigating officer of the case could not produce relevant  documents and the complainant also failed to appear before the court, he said, adding the hearing will now take place on September 18. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/court-defers-hearing-on-bail-plea-of-woman-who-claims-to-be-2nd-wife-of-minister-311073
14-09-2021||New Delhi||Hindi is ‘sakhi’ of regional languages; all must be promoted: Amit Shah||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday strongly pitched for promotion and encouragement of all Indian languages and said Hindi is the ‘sakhi’ (friend) of regional languages.Addressing a function organised on the occasion of ‘Hindi Divas’, Shah also appealed to the parents to communicate with their children at home in mother tongue even if they study in English medium schools.Otherwise, the children will be cut-off from their roots, he said.“Hindi has no conflict or contradiction with any local language. official language. Hindi is the ‘Sakhi’ of all local languages of India and its development can be done only by mutual cooperation of each other,” he said.Shah said Hindi and all regional languages must be promoted and encouraged.The Home Minister said gone are the days when there was hesitation in speaking Hindi as Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks only in Hindi at international forums.He said the basis of evaluation of any person should be his thoughts, actions, intelligence, diligence and loyalty while language is only a medium of expression.“Those who say that our mother tongue and official language are a hindrance in the development of personality, I want to tell them that there can be no better medium of expression of knowledge than mother tongue,” he said.Shah said India has been successful in handling the COVID-19 pandemic with minimum damage due to joint efforts of the central and state governments with the active cooperation of 130 crore population.The Prime Minister, whenever he addressed the nation, talked with all stakeholders—chief ministers, doctors, experts and others—he always spoke in Hindi, which resulted in the message reaching the grassroots level, he said.Shah said since 2014, more MPs are speaking in their own regional language in Parliament and they are being translated verbatim to English and Hindi.This helped people’s representatives to highlight the problems of their respective areas in the highest forum, he said.The Home Minister said people should not only be ‘Atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) in producing goods or doing trade but also in the field of language as well.He said translation of the history of every state should be done in the official language so that not just one state but the entire country can read this great history.Shah suggested that just like September 14 is an occasion to reassess and review efforts to promote Hindi every year, a similar and simultaneous exercise should be undertaken to promote all local languages too.Referring to the New Education Policy (NEP) envisaged by Modi, Shah said it has provisions for promotion of regional and Hindi languages.He said the technical education syllabus is translated into five Indian languages—Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi and Bangla—and it would be rolled out in 14 colleges across eight states.

14-09-2021||New Delhi||What has happened in BJP internally in past six months is somewhat of a rarity under Modi-Shah’s leadership: Analysis||What has happened in the BJP in the past six months is somewhat of a rarity in the party running under the immaculate control of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah.The leadership which almost never replaced any chief minister (even in Jharkhand where sentiments were clearly against incumbent CM Raghubar Das in 2019) has changed four chief ministers in the past six months. While Gujarat’s Vijay Rupani became the fourth BJP CM to resign after Trivendra Singh Rawat and Tirath Singh Rawat in Uttarakhand and BS Yediyurappa in Karnataka, the buzz is there might be “a couple of more changes” in days to come depending upon the situation.What is even more surprising is the choice of replacements, largely “second-rung leaders”, “back benchers in the state assemblies” as some said in case of new Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel.While the change has obviously been prompted by the need to win a poll-bound state with enough time to recover lost ground, the choice of CM has left baffled even those familiar with Modi-Shah’s “out of box decisions and ability to surprise”. Observers say the reason for extra focus on states now is simple. While earlier PM Modi and Shah were concentrating on organisation, now they are focusing on states. “You first put your house in order,” they say.A second-rung leader makes control easier for those sitting in Delhi instead of some well-entrenched politician with his or her own baggage, followers and adversaries.“Besides, PM Modi likes to give opportunities to new leaders,” they add.Moreover, whether Pushkar Dhami in Uttarakhand or Bhupendra Patel in Gujarat, they fulfil basic requirements of the party ahead of the election campaign in their respective states which in any case will be formulated and led by PM Modi and Shah.Whether they will help undo some of the anti-incumbency in favour of the BJP is a new experiment that the central leadership appears to be performing.  In any case, the leadership is clear that those who create “trouble by poking or continuously raising issues which eventually lead to the ouster of any CM should not be encouraged by giving them posts they have been vying for”, a signal perhaps to many in similar situations in other states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-has-happened-in-bjp-internally-in-past-six-months-is-somewhat-of-a-rarity-under-modi-shahs-leadership-analysis-311065
14-09-2021||London/New Delhi||India, UK aim to start FTA talks by November 1||India and the UK are aiming to start negotiations for the proposed bilateral free trade agreement by November 1, a move aimed at enhancing trade and investments between the two countries.Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday said the two countries are moving towards an early harvest trade agreement, with a comprehensive FTA (Free Trade Agreement) as the next step.The UK expressed hope that there is a “strong possibility” to get an early agreement on trade between the two countries.The matters related to FTA came up during a virtual meeting between Goyal and his British counterpart Secretary of State Elizabeth Truss on Tuesday.“Proposed FTA between India and the UK is expected to unlock extraordinary business opportunities and generate jobs. Both sides have renewed their commitment to boosting trade in a manner which benefits all,” India’s Commerce and Industry Ministry said in a statement.Speaking on the occasion, Goyal said there is a keenness to have an early conclusion of negotiations for quick and early economic benefits to businesses on both sides.He also informed that substantial work has already been done and extensive stakeholder consultations have been held involving industry, business associations, export promotion councils, buyers/sellers associations, regulatory bodies, ministries, and public research bodies for the proposed pact.Further, bilateral working groups for different tracks have been formed to understand ambitions, interests and sensitivities of each other to facilitate accelerated progress during the negotiations. The meetings of these groups are presently in progress and are likely to be completed by September.Goyal said these discussions would help both sides in understanding each other’s policy regimes and would put us in a better position when both sides begin their joint scoping discussions, beginning on October 1, for finalising the terms of references for launch of negotiations in November.“An interim trade agreement, as a first step of a FTA would allow both of us to immensely benefit from the early gains of the partnership,” he said, adding that India and UK are strengthening trade ties by moving towards an early harvest deal followed by a comprehensive FTA.In a free trade agreement, two or more trading partners significantly reduce or eliminate customs duties on the maximum number of goods traded between them besides liberalising norms to promote trade in services and investments. In an interim trade pact, customs duties are removed on a limited number of goods.Goyal emphasised the need to strike a balance between commitments and concessions in goods and services.Further, the statement said that certain services of mutual interest may be included in the interim agreement through the request offer approach wherein it can include priority sectors which are immediately deliverable.“If necessary, we may also explore signing a few Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) in selective services like nursing and architecture services,” it added.MRAs pave the way for recognition of the professional bodies of one country by the other. Regulatory bodies of various professional services like engineering, nursing, accountancy and architecture are encouraged to enter into these pacts.UK Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss, in a statement posted on her Twitter handle, announced the launch of trade working groups to lay the groundwork for a forthcoming UK-India trade agreement.“Today Piyush Goyal and I launched trade working groups to lay the groundwork for our forthcoming UK-India trade deal, which will: boost access to more than a billion consumers; bolster our science and tech industries; and support jobs in both countries,”  she said.The UK’s Department for International Trade (DIT) said the talks between the two ministers focussed on the scope and ambition for a UK-India FTA, following the close of the UK’s formal consultation process ahead of the negotiations on August 31.The UK government said these regular ministerial dialogues help both sides better understand each other’s position on potential chapter areas in any trade deal, including tariffs, standards, IP (Intellectual Property) and data regulation.Truss reaffirmed her ambition to negotiate a trade agreement that delivers results for the British people and businesses, including those in digital and data, tech and food and drink. Both ministers agreed that continuing to engage with the business community was vital throughout the forthcoming negotiations, DIT said.According to officials, findings from the DIT’s public consultation will be published before the start of formal trade negotiations as part of a wider package outlining a strategic rationale for the FTA, including the UK’s negotiating objectives and economic analysis of a potential deal.Earlier, the UK trade ministry said that preparations towards an FTA with India was progressing. A deal would represent a major boost for UK exporters, lowering tariffs, easing regulation, and driving up bilateral trade which totalled GBP 23 billion in 2019, it noted.Increasing UK-India trade has been dubbed a huge opportunity by the UK, given India’s position as one of the world’s biggest and fastest-growing economies and home to more than a billion consumers.“We are looking at a comprehensive trade agreement that covers everything, from financial services to legal services to digital and data, as well as goods and agriculture. We think there is a strong possibility for us to get an early agreement, where we lower tariffs on both sides and start to see more goods flowing between our two countries,” Truss said.The bilateral trade between the two nations stood at USD 13.11 billion in 2020-21 as against USD 15.45 billion in 2019-20. Trade balance is in favour of India.India’s main exports to the UK are textiles, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, petroleum products, transport equipment, spices, machinery and instruments, pharmaceuticals and marine products.The main imports from Britain include precious and semi-precious stones, ores, metal scraps, engineering goods, chemicals and machinery. In the services sector, the UK is the largest market in Europe for Indian IT services. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-uk-aim-to-start-fta-talks-by-november-1-311063

Ghosh provided details of the cases filed at different police stations in Assam against Banerjee.The cases were filed in 2018 when Banerjee expressed concern about the Bengali residents of Assam, many of whom were allegedly victimised during the controversial exercise of updating the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam.The BJP raised the issue against Mamata during the Assembly elections held earlier this year also when the TMC supremo was locked in an electoral contest with BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari. Then also, the EC had ignored the objections.Candidatures of Priyanka Tibrewal (BJP) and Shrijeeb Biswas (CPI-M), who are in the fray from Bhabanipur, were also accepted by EC after scrutiny of nomination papers today.Similarly, candidatures of all nine aspirants, including TMC nominee Jakir Hossain, BJP’s Sujit Das and Left Front’s Jane Alam Mian (RSP), were accepted after scrutiny for the September 30 election in Jangipur Assembly constituency.Candidatures of all seven candidates, including Amirul Islam of TMC, Zaidur Rahaman of the Congress, Md. Modassar Hossain of CPI-M and Milan Ghosh of the BJP have been accepted after scrutiny for the election in Samserganj Assembly constituency on September 30.The counting is slated to take place on October 3.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhabanipur-bypoll-mamatas-nomination-accepted-by-ec-ignoring-bjp-objections-311054
14-09-2021||New Delhi||‘Champion of anti-women mindset’: Priyanka Gandhi slams UP CM Adityanath||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday attacked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over the issue of crimes against women in the state and alleged that he was the champion of “anti-women mindset”.Her attack on Adityanath came as on this day, last year, the horrific Hathras incident took place in which a young Dalit woman was raped by four men. The woman died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital during treatment.“A year ago from today, a horrific incident of rape had happened in Hathras and instead of providing justice and security to the family, the Uttar Pradesh government had threatened the family and also snatched away their right to give their daughter an honourable funeral,” Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.Government officials and BJP leaders had made statements to the effect that there was “no rape” and the energy of the entire government machinery was spent on character assassination of the victim, the Congress general secretary alleged.How can you even expect sensitivity from the head of a government that has such a horrible stance on crimes against women? Priyanka Gandhi asked.“Anyway, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh is the champion of anti-women mindset.  He has said that ‘women should not be independent’,” she claimed.The victim was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on September 30. Her family alleged they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites.

14-09-2021||New Delhi||Historians, experts welcome Chandni Chowk’s heritage-sensitive revamp||Pedestrianisation and rejuvenation of a historic stretch in old Delhi’s Chandni Chowk has been welcomed by historians and other experts, who concurred that this architecturally sensitive redevelopment project is a good start for built heritage in the city.A nearly 1.4-km stretch of Chandni Chowk, from the Red Fort area to Fatehpuri Masjid, has been made a non-motorised vehicle zone from 9 am to 9 pm as part of a holistic initiative by the Shahjehanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC).Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday dedicated the revamped stretch to the people, and announced that the entire area will be transformed into a tourist hub by allowing street food joints to operate till midnight.Red sandstones, complementing the aesthetic look of the 17th century Mughal-era fort, have been used to carve out benches and other decorative material, while period-styled street furniture add to the cultural ethos of the area, steeped in history.The project has received thumbs up from heritage experts and aficionados alike, who flock to the Walled City to admire iconic landmarks, old buildings and enjoy lip-smacking street food.Historian and author Rana Safvi, who has written extensively on Shahjehanabad, termed the project a “very good start” when it comes to matters of heritage, more so in a rapidly urbanising city like Delhi.“It is very welcoming to see, government authorities and various agencies, keeping heritage at the centre while devising a redevelopment project. Heritage often suffers in the name of development, and the Chandni Chowk project certainly raises the level of optimism one feels for heritage buildings,” she said.The author of ‘Shahjehanabad: The Living City of Old Delhi’ expressed delight over the pedestrianisation of the old street, which will allow visitors to now admire the “old architectural fabric” of the area, whose view was earlier marred by overhead electric cables and burgeoning traffic.“You cannot admire such old streetscape when there are vehicles plying around you. Now, people will have the vantage point to see, admire and click pictures and take back memories home. Earlier, it was congested traffic and pollution and these were all one would face in this stretch of Chandni Chowk,” Safvi said.Historian and author Swapna Liddle also welcomed the project as a “very good move” and hoped the entire Shahjehanabad will get the kind of attention, the historic core of the city deserves.“It is a good start but it will have to be seen in totality, eventually. As in rejuvenation of whole Shahjehanabad should be taken into account rather than just in a piecemeal way. But this heritage-sensitive redevelopment project certainly means good news for heritage,” she said.The next stage of the project will involve facade rejuvenation and making the area more vibrant, officials said.Delhi PWD Minister and SRDC chairman Satyendar Jain on Sunday had told reporters that the plan was to run a ‘heritage-look’ green vehicle on the stretch.Suggestions are also coming that uniform shop boards, as in many other pedestrianisation projects abroad, could be used. However, there is no official confirmation on it.Liddle, author of ‘Chandni Chowk: The Mughal City of Old Delhi’, who also conducts heritage walks, suggested that each signage should be in sync with the building it is mounted on.“One signage or font used on it may look good on one building but not suit another building with a different architectural style on its facade. Also, multiple languages and calligraphic and other designs should be allowed to be explored by shop owners instead of hemming them in,” she said.Safvi said e-rickshaws and old-style horse carriages are very good options for plying on the pedestrianised stretch.“A small write-up with a photo or artwork of a monument of Delhi can be embossed on the back side of an e-rickshaw, which would also enhance the knowledge of people about heritage of Delhi,” she added.Also, a signage with basic information about the old buildings should be installed in front of them to engage the visitors, the historian said.Various other heritage experts and conservation architects also welcomed the redevelopment of Chandni Chowk that was built by Jehan Ara, daughter of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.“Earlier there were three markets, Urdu Bazaar, Johri Bazaar and Fatehpuri Bazaar. And, a square existed in the middle of it, so the name Chandni Chowk. The area has changed a lot, it has seen the glory of the Mughals, their fall, the 1857 First War of Independence and eventually rise of a free, democratic India in 1947. So, it deserves this special attention,” Safvi said.Kejriwal, after inaugurating the redeveloped stretch, had said that earlier broken roads, dangling wires, traffic congestion were synonymous with Chandni Chowk, but now it has become beautiful and aesthetically appealing.“We have beautified almost 1.4 km stretch of the Chandni Chowk and made it extremely beautiful. Traffic on the stretch was improved, dangling wires were made underground, and CCTVs were installed under the redevelopment project,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/historians-experts-welcome-chandni-chowks-heritage-sensitive-revamp-311048

Now such a practice has been stopped by his government."A person who is sitting on the post of Chief Minister has made derogatory remarks against a particular community. Such an act creates division in the country. It is nothing but an attempt to target a community to garner votes," Hashmi said."I have filed a petition in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate in the Muzaffarpur district court. The next hearing of the case is scheduled on September 21," the complainant added.—  IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/case-filed-in-bihar-against-adityanath-for-abba-jaan-remark-in-up-311025
14-09-2021||New Delhi||Country belongs to all, maintain restraint in comments: JD (U) on Adityanath’s ‘abba jaan’ remarks||With “abba jaan” remarks of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath stoking a row, JD(U) president Lalan Singh said on Tuesday that political parties should maintain “restraint” in their comments, asserting that the country belongs to everyone, be it Hindus, Muslims, Christians or any other community.“Terms like ‘unity in diversity’ are used for our country. The country belongs to all. No remarks should be made that harm the country,” Singh, a confidant of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, told reporters when asked for his reaction to the BJP leader’s comments.In this context, he also took a swipe at JMM leader and Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren for his remarks allegedly aimed at Bhojpuri and Magahi-speaking people of the state. Everybody has a right to settle in whichever part of the country they like, he said.Addressing a programme in Kushinagar on Sunday, Adityanath had alleged that people did not get rations before 2017 like they do now.“Because then, people who say ‘abba jaan’ used to digest the rations. The rations of Kushinagar used to go to Nepal and Bangladesh. Today, if anybody tries to swallow the rations meant for poor people, he will land in jail,” the chief minister said.‘Abba jaan’ is the Urdu term for father.In his press conference, the JD(U) president, a Lok Sabha MP from Munger, also played down the decision of his party, the biggest BJP ally, to send its senior leader K C Tyagi to a rally being organised in Jind on September 25 by INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala, seen as part of effort for forming a non-BJP, non-Congress front.“We are strongly part of the NDA (BJP-led alliance),” he said and dismissed the talks about the third front, saying his party will attend the rally as it is being organised to mark the birth anniversary of Devi Lal, a towering third front leader of his era.Singh also cited Kumar’s old association with Chautala.Chautala had invited the Bihar chief minister, who has expressed his inability to attend it.The JD(U) leader also named former MLA Khiru Mahto and Gulab Mahto as the party’s president and vice president respectively for its Jharkhand unit.Singh said the JD(U) used to be a strong party in the state and added that the appointments are part of its effort to strengthen the regional party in different parts of India.The party will also strongly fight the upcoming assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh and Manipur, he said, adding it will like to be part of the BJP-led alliance and fight on its own if the tie-up does not happen.JD(U) sources said the party is likely to organise its national executive meeting in Uttar Pradesh in November and its office-bearers meeting in Manipur as it works to tone up its organisational machinery in the two states.

There is also talk on the chances of Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, RC Faldu, and Kaushik Patel, senior ministers in the Rupani cabinet, being retained.Party sources said efforts will be made to accommodate senior leaders in the cabinet as far as possible.Union Home Minister Amit Shah met Patel and state BJP president CR Paatil Monday night before leaving for New Delhi, party sources said. Cabinet formation was likely discussed, they added.Patel was unanimously elected BJP legislature party leader on Sunday and was sworn in as the state’s 17th chief minister by Governor Acharya Devvrat in Gandhinagar on Monday. Shah was present in the oath-taking ceremony.Patel’s elevation to the coveted post is being attributed to his closeness to former Gujarat chief minister and current Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel.Rupani, the fourth chief minister to demit office in BJP-ruled states during the coronavirus pandemic, completed five years in office on August 7 this year.With state Assembly polls scheduled in December 2022, the BJP is banking on Patel, a Patidar, for poll victory.

He then posted the matter for September 20.The magistrate said if the actor failed to appear on the next hearing, a warrant would be issued against her.

In July 2021, WPI inflation stood at 11.16 per cent.In August 2020, WPI inflation was at 0.41 per cent.“The high rate of inflation in August 2021 is primarily due to rise in prices of non-food articles, mineral oils; crude petroleum and natural gas; manufactured products like basic metals; food products; textiles; chemicals and chemical products etc as compared the corresponding month of the previous year,” the Commerce and Industry Ministry said in a statement.Inflation in food articles eased for the fourth straight month, recording (-) 1.29 per cent in August, from zero per cent in July, even as onion and pulses prices spiked. Inflation in onions was high at 62.78 per cent, while that in pulses was 9.41 per cent.

Dialogue will help raise funds to accelerate India’s transfer to green technology. — Bhupender Yadav, Environment minister“The partnership will provide both countries an opportunity to renew collaboration on climate change while addressing the financing aspects,” said Yadav.Before embarking on his India visit, Kerry had said the US and its allies have been promised a huge amount of funding from private sector to help India’s efforts to mitigate global warming. In return, he said the US would want India to commit to achieving net-zero emissions.“I hope this dialogue will work to mobilise and deliver climate finance primarily as grants and concessional finance as envisaged under the Paris Agreement to strengthen climate action,” Yadav said, pointing out that India is an attractive destination for global clean energy investments.Yadav said the dialogue would help align “swift climate action with inclusive and resilient economic development, taking into account national circumstances and sustainable development priorities”.He meant that the dialogue would help raise funds to accelerate India’s transfer to green technology much faster than its current commitment.

He was 80. He died at a private hospital in Mangalore, where he was admitted in July after a fall during a yoga session.Fernandes began his political career as member, municipal council, Udupi, in 1972 and rose to become a nine-time MP — five terms in the Lok Sabha and four in the Rajya Sabha. He was first elected to the Lok Sabha in 1980, where he remained until 1997. In 1998, Fernandes made his RS debut and was currently a sitting member from Karnataka, capping 41 years in Parliament alone.A Gandhi family loyalist, Fernandes was minister of state in UPA-I and cabinet minister with road transport, highways and labour portfolios in UPA-II. He served in various capacities — member of the Congress Working Committee, Karnataka Congress president, AICC joint secretary and general secretary.Fernandes’ early rise in the Congress was attributed to his proximity to late PM Rajiv Gandhi. Former bureaucrat Wajahat Habibullah, who served in the PMOs of both Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, writes in his memoirs that Rajiv Gandhi appointed three parliamentary secretaries at a time — Oscar Fernandes, Ahmed Patel and his Doon school friend Arun Singh.“The wags termed them Rajiv’s Amar, Akbar, Anthony,” Habibullah writes in “My Years with Rajiv”.Oscar remained parliamentary secretary from December 1984 to June 1985. The experiment failed and by September 1985, Rajiv Gandhi had appointed IAS officer of the 1952 batch Sarla Grewal as secretary to PM. After Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination, Oscar remained loyal to Sonia, who rewarded him generously.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oscar-fernandes-gandhi-family-loyalist-who-donned-many-hats-310775

He also said that the crop cultivated by farmers, whether in their own land or rented property, would be procured by the government. Farmers will not have to provide proof of land records while registering.Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal said the government’ intention was to ensure actual farmers get the benefit of MSP, which has “increased substantially in the past five years”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/barring-3-all-states-integrate-land-records-with-e-portal-310777

It took note of the fact that endeavours to resolve the matrimonial dispute through mediation could not fructify.The Bench said the marriage deserved to be dissolved on the ground of cruelty as well under the Hindu Marriage Act in view of the woman’s conduct during the judicial proceedings.Repeated filing of cases and complaints against a spouse can amount to “cruelty” — a ground for divorce under the HMA, the top court ruled. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/crash-landing-at-take-off-supreme-court-annuls-19-yr-old-marriage-310785

You only had to say whether it has been done or not. CJI-led BenchCan’t file affidavit, Not in national interest, says centreThe Solicitor General vehemently referred to the threat to national security and said the government didn’t wish to file a detailed affidavit as this was not in national interest.Reiterating it was not interested in knowing issues related to national security, the SC said it would pass an interim order on petitions seeking a court-monitored SIT probe into alleged snooping on politicians, journalists and activists. “Hearing is concluded. Order is reserved,” a Bench led by CJI NV Ramana said after hearing arguments from various parties on the issue. The development came after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the government didn’t want to file any additional affidavit to publicly clarify if Pegasus was used for snooping or not even if he maintained that the Centre had nothing to hide.“You have repeatedly been saying that the government doesn’t want to file an affidavit. We also don’t want any security issues to be put before us. You say that a committee will be formed and the report will be submitted... We have to look into the whole issue and pass an interim order,” the Bench told Mehta.As Mehta insisted that the matter should be examined by a panel of experts and the report should be submitted to the top court and then the court could decide if the report would be put in the public domain or not, the Bench said such a decision would not take the issue anywhere.“Mr Mehta, you have been beating about the bush and that’s not the question here,” the Bench told the Solicitor General. Mehta said if there was a rethinking in the government on filing a detailed affidavit, he would bring it to the court’s notice.“We are reserving orders. We will pass an interim order. It will take two-three days. If you have some re-thinking on this, you can mention the matter before us,” the Bench told the Solicitor General.On Mehta citing national security as a reason for not making it public, the Bench said, “We are not interested to know about national interest issues… but we want to know about the allegations that some software was used to snoop on certain citizens like lawyers etc. We wanted to know if it’s done and to see if it’s permissible under law.”On behalf of various petitioners, senior advocates Kapil Sibal, AM Singhvi, Shyam Divan, Rakesh Dwivedi, Meenakshi Arora and Colin Gonsalves insisted that the government must disclose if the controversial software was used in India or not as it was a question of violation of fundamental rights of citizens.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/was-pegasus-used-illegally-asks-sc-after-centre-refuses-to-file-additional-affidavit-310754

The world must come together to create enabling environment. — S Jaishankar, EAMThe situation in the country, dire because of an ongoing drought, has worsened after the Taliban takeover. “Once relief materials reach that country, the world will naturally expect a non-discriminatory distribution of humanitarian assistance across all sections of the Afghan society. Only the UN has the capacity to monitor such endeavours and reassure donors,” underlined Jaishankar while refraining from announcing an immediate grant. Jaishankar wanted the immediate normalisation of regular commercial operations at Kabul airport so that it became the basis for regular flow of relief material.Guterres also said that “international and Afghan humanitarian organisations are on the ground and can deliver. They need sustained access into and around Afghanistan.” Meanwhile, the Taliban dismissed rumours about a clash between its Deputy PM Mullah Baradar and Anas Haqqani that reportedly left the former seriously injured or dead.Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted an audio message, purportedly from Baradar, dismissing reports about his death.Social media handles from Pakistan began a counter campaign alleging that millions of dollars and gold were recovered from the home of resistance leader Amrullah Saleh. But they were countered by pro-Panjshir Valley accounts, which reminded them of earlier claims that a Saleh entourage had fled in three helicopters. “Why did he then leave so much money behind for the Taliban?” one asked sarcastically.While several speakers at the UN announced donations in response to a UN flash appeal seeking $606 million for the rest of the year to bring relief to 1.1 crore Afghans, it was not clear whether this aid would be disbursed immediately or subject to conditions of fair distribution to all parts of the country. India and others fear that if given directly to the Taliban, most of the aid may go to the Taliban power base of eastern, south-eastern and southern Afghanistan to the detriment of mostly non-Pashtuns in west, central and north Afghanistan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wary-of-direct-aid-to-afghan-india-pitches-for-un-role-310760

He also said the crop cultivated by farmers, whether in their own land or rented property, will be procured by the government.“It is not necessary for farmers to own the land, if they have cultivated any land the crop will be procured,” he said.The main objective is to find out how much crop has been cultivated in what area and accordingly procure and that the government procures from genuine farmers and not from traders, he added.Farmers will not have to provide physical proofs of land records while registering.Some states like Uttar Pradesh and Odisha had already integrated their land records.Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal, who was also present at the interaction said the government’ intention is to ensure actual farmers get the benefit of MSP, which has “increased substantially in the past five years”.Regarding farmers’ objection to Rs 40 a quintal rise wheat MSP, he said the government was committed to giving the farmers 50 per cent return over the cost and in those terms wheat, rapeseed and mustard got “100 per cent return over the cost”     Rs 491 cr released to Punjab, Haryana and UP for stubble burning issueMeanwhile, around Rs 491 crore have been released to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh ahead of harvesting of Kharif crops for tackling the stubble burning issue, Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal said, adding that a meeting with representatives of Punjab and Haryana governments will be held soon in this regard.Agarwal said the states have also been asked to allow gram sabhas to open custom hiring centres so that small farmers can have access to machines and equipment used in the management of crop residue.Harvesting of paddy, the main Kharif crop, will begin from October onwards and stubble burning remains a major cause of air pollution in Northern plains in the weeks that follow  In the 2021-22 FY, the Centre released Rs 491 crore funds to Punjab, Haryana and UP for tackling the stubble burning issue of which Rs 235 crore was for Punjab, Rs 141 crore for Haryana and Rs 115 crore to Uttar Pradesh, he said.In the last four years, Rs 1,050.68 crore has been released to Punjab, Rs 640.9 crore to Haryana, Rs 489.08 crore to UP and Rs 4.52 crore to Delhi for management of crop residue.  So far about 21,125 custom hiring centres have been opened in Punjab and 4,224 centres in Haryana, he also said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agriculture-land-records-integrated-with-centres-e-portal-by-all-but-3-states-310616
14-09-2021||New Delhi||Brother-sister duo on top in CA final exam||A sister-brother duo made headlines as the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) released results for the CA final exam on Monday with 19-year-old Nandini Agrawal topping the exam with 614/800 marks (76.75%) and her brother, Sachin Agrawal (21) securing All India Rank (AIR) 18.Both the students of Victor Convent School in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh prepared together for the IPCC (Integrated Professional Competency Course) and CA (Chartered Accountants) final."Our strategy has been simple - we support each other but we critique even more. When we solve a question paper, he checks my answers and I check his. There were times when I lost hope but my brother helped me throughout that phase," said Nandini, who skipped two classes and studied in the same grade as her brother.She had passed class 12 in 2017 and is presently doing her articleship from PwC (Price Waterhouse Coopers). She had also got an AIR 31 in the IPCC exam.Admitting that just like any other siblings in the world, they occasionally fought, Sachin said, "but that only lasted for some time and we got back to normal".Praising his sister, he said, "I would have been happy with even 70 per cent marks as I did not have high expectations but I knew that Nandini will do great. She's brilliant and deserves all the success. In many ways, she is my mentor." Sachin is pursuing his articleship from Gurugram-based firm, One Point Advisors.The duo advised aspirants to follow the ICAI study material for acing the exam saying, "it has worked really well for them".Highlighting a major issue faced by female aspirants due to their gender, Nandini said, "Girls do not get as many chances to prove themselves as compared to boys. If they cannot crack any competitive exam in one or two attempts, then they are asked to give it up, whereas the same does not apply to boys.""I have been fortunate enough to have very supportive parents, but all parents should help their kids follow their dreams, be it a boy or a girl," the teenager added.Their father is a tax consultant while their mother is a homemaker.

14-09-2021||---||India pitches for UN role, wary of direct aid to Kabul to avert food crises||New Delhi, September 13The global community has promised to be generous to the needs of the Afghan people but had reservations about providing aid directly to the Taliban even as there were rumours in Kabul over the death of a senior Taliban leader.Speaking at a UN conference called by its Secretary-General António Guterres on Monday to address the critical humanitarian needs of Afghans, many participants including External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar pointed out the need to ensure that humanitarian assistance providers are accorded direct access to Afghanistan. The situation in the country, dire because of an ongoing drought, has worsened after the Taliban takeover.“Once relief materials reach that country, the world will naturally expect a non-discriminatory distribution of humanitarian assistance across all sections of the Afghan society. Only the UN has the capacity to monitor such endeavours and reassure donors,” underlined Jaishankar while refraining from announcing an immediate grant. Jaishankar wanted the immediate normalisation of regular commercial operations at Kabul airport so that it becomes the basis for regular flow of relief material.Gutteres also said that “international and Afghan humanitarian organisations are on the ground and can deliver. They need sustained access into and around Afghanistan”.Meanwhile, the Taliban dismissed rumours about a clash between Taliban’s Deputy PM Mullah Baradar and Anas Haqqani that reportedly left the former seriously injured or dead.Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted an audio message, purportedly from Baradar, dismissing reports about his death. However, despite being Deputy PM, Baradar was not photographed during the visit of Qatar Foreign Minister Mohd bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani on Saturday.Social media handles from Pakistan began a counter campaign alleging that millions of dollars and gold was recovered from the home of resistance leader Amrullah Saleh. But they were countered by pro-Panjshir Valley accounts who reminded them of earlier claims that a Saleh entourage had fled in three helicopters. “Why did he then leave so much money behind for the Taliban?” one asked sarcastically.While several speakers at the UN announced donations in response to a UN Flash Appeal seeking $606 million for the rest of the year to bring relief to 1.1 crore Afghans, it was not clear whether this aid will be disbursed immediately or subject to conditions of fair distribution to all parts of the country.India and other countries fear that if given directly to the Taliban, most of the aid may go to the Taliban power base of eastern, south-eastern and southern Afghanistan to the detriment of mostly non-Pashtuns in west, central and north Afghanistan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-pitches-for-un-role-wary-of-direct-aid-to-kabul-to-avert-food-crises-310612

14-09-2021||Chennai||Tamil Nadu Assembly passes Bill seeking exemption from NEET||The Tamil Nadu Assembly on Monday adopted a Bill to dispense with the National Entrance-cum-Eligibility Test (NEET) and provide for admission to medical courses based on Class XII marks to ensure social justice.The Bills adopted in 2017 for the same purpose during the AIADMK regime did not get the President’s assent.The Bill’s passage comes against the backdrop of the suicide of a medical aspirant fearing outcome of the national test he was to take and the incident echoed in the House, with the main opposition AIADMK targeting the government.Chief Minister M K Stalin introduced the Bill and all parties, including the main opposition AIADMK and its ally PMK, besides others like Congress, supported it and it was passed by a voice vote.It seeks to provide for admission to UG courses in medicine, dentistry, Indian medicine and homeopathy on the basis of marks obtained in the qualifying examination, (Class XII). The opposition BJP staged a walkout, protesting against the government move.Earlier, as soon as the House convened, Leader of the Opposition K Palaniswami referred to the suicide of 19-year-old Dhanush in his native Salem district on Sunday and targeted the government on the matter.He said though the DMK had promised “cancelling” NEET, it was not done and several students had not prepared well. Some of his remarks were expunged by Speaker M Appavu.Palaniswami sought a job for a person from the deceased’s family, besides cash assistance.The opposition party MLAs, who came to the House wearing black badges, staged a walkout, led by Palaniswami.On Sunday, hours before he was to appear for NEET for a third time, Dhanush, belonging to a village near Salem, died by suicide, fearing the outcome of the test he was to take. The incident triggered a blame game, with the AIADMK holding the DMK regime responsible for the death and the state government targeting the Centre.Stalin, in his reply, said NEET was conducted for the first time in Tamil Nadu when Palaniswami was the Chief Minister and was not held even when the late J Jayalalithaa was the CM.Recalling the death by suicides of students, including S Anita, in recent years, he said all these happened when Palaniswami was the CM.The student, Dhanush, who took the extreme step, could not clear the exam twice when the AIADMK was in power.Stalin also targeted the AIADMK over rejection of Bills enacted during its regime in 2017 to get the state exempted from the ambit of NEET and also for “hiding” it from the House.Stalin introduced the Bill and appealed to all to support it for social justice, indicating that this initiative would be different from what was done during the AIADMK regime.When the Bill was taken up for consideration hours later, Palaniswami recalled the efforts taken by the AIADMK government to exempt Tamil Nadu from the ambit of NEET, including adoption of two Bills in 2017. Later, he said the AIADMK government provided 7.5 per cent internal reservation to government school students in admission to medical courses who cleared NEET.On Stalin saying that the current effort was different from what was done during the AIADMK regime, the leader of the opposition said the only difference was a reference to the recommendations of a high-level panel, led by Justice A K Rajan.Palaniswami also pointed to the Central enactments and a judgment of the Supreme Court on this subject and considering such aspects, asked whether the state Bill could prevail. Eventually, he said the AIADMK however supported the Bill.The CM welcomed the support of the main opposition party to his government’s move on NEET and recalled that in the past, when the DMK was in the opposition, it supported the then AIADMK government on the issue of jallikattu, the bull-taming sport.When BJP’s Nainar Nagendran insisted that NEET had its benefits and said that the pass percentage, vis-a-vis the test from TN, was on the rise, he saw intervention from Ministers.When Nagendran said NEET was like only an exam like the IAS and TN Public Service Commission, Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said such exams had other features as well, including interviews and this comparison was not correct. The BJP MLA should also specify if he was making a reference from any reports and avoid generalisation when he spoke on pass percentage in subjects like anatomy and biochemistry (after NEET’s introduction), the Minister said.Stalin said aspects like pass percentage were not important. So far 15 aspirants have died by suicide and keeping such factors in mind, the Bill has been moved. “Our goal is that their sacrifices should not go waste,” he said.Opposing the Bill, Nagendran led his party’s walkout, protesting against the bill.Later, the TN Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021, was declared adopted by Speaker Appavu.The Bill, referring to recommendations of a high-level committee, said the government has decided to enact a law to dispense with the requirement of NEET for admission to UG Medical courses.Providing for admission to such courses on the basis of marks obtained in Class 12 and through “Normalisation methods”, the statement of objects and reasons said this is to ensure “social justice, uphold equality and equal opportunity.” This is also to protect all vulnerable student communities from being discriminated and bring them to the mainstream of medical and dental education and in turn to “ensure a robust public health care across the state, particularly the rural areas.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tamil-nadu-assembly-passes-bill-seeking-exemption-from-neet-310600
14-09-2021||Washington||New bill could help Indians get US Green Card by paying supplemental fee||Millions of people stuck for years in the employment-based Green Card backlog in the US, including a sizable number of Indians, can hope for a lawful permanent residency in America by paying a supplemental fee if a new House bill is passed into law.The move, if included in the reconciliation package and passed into law, is expected to help thousands of Indian IT professionals who are currently stuck in an agonising Green Card backlog.A Green Card, known officially as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued to immigrants as evidence that the bearer has been granted the privilege of residing permanently in the US.According to the committee print released by the US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over immigration, an employment-based immigrant applicant with a “priority date that is more than 2 years before” can adjust to permanent residence without numerical limits by paying a “supplemental fee of USD 5,000.”                The fee is USD 50,000 for the EB-5 category (immigrant investors). The provisions expire in 2031, the Forbes magazine reported.For a family-based immigrant who is sponsored by a US citizen and with a “priority date that is more than 2 years before”, the fee for getting a Green Card would be USD 2,500.The supplement fee would be USD 1,500 if an applicant’s priority date is not within two years but they are required to be present in the country, according to the committee print. This fee would be in addition to any administrative processing fee paid by the applicant.However, the bill does not contain permanent structural changes to the legal immigration system, including eliminating country caps for green cards or increasing the annual quotas of H-1B visas.Before becoming law, the provisions would have to pass the Judiciary Committee, the House of Representatives and the Senate and be signed by the president, the report said.According to a report in CBSNews, if successful, the legalisation plan would allow undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) beneficiaries, farmworkers and other pandemic-era essential workers to apply for permanent US residency, or green cards.Reacting to the bill, David J Bier, Immigration policy analyst at Cato Institute, said, “employment-based applicants can adjust if they have waited 2 years from their priority date... this is almost like abolishing the EB caps for adjustment applicants who can pay $5K. Awesome!” “For EB5, it’s $50K fee. Even those who can’t afford the fees or who are abroad would benefit from freeing up this cap space for others. It’s unfair that the bill maintains the country caps as is, so Indians and Chinese will be the only EB applicants required to pay the $5K/50K,” he said in a series of tweets.He said that the base caps for diversity, family, and #H1B all remain the same.“Since H1B is the feeder for most EB, that’s basically like keeping the EB cap the same. No reforms to #H2A, #H2B, or other work programs, so nothing to help unskilled workers/address the border,” he said.“Basically, this bill will help a few legal immigrants abroad indirectly, but the main purpose is integration of existing immigrants. That’s a noble cause, but the immigration/migration part of immigration reform is just left out. No new pathways for workers, same system,” he tweeted.US Congressmen, including Indian-American Raja Krishnamoorthi had last month urged their Congressional colleagues to support their move to employment-based Green Card backlog as part of budget reconciliation.A group of 40 US lawmakers, led by Krishnamoorthi, had written to Speaker of House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, saying the budget reconciliation package provides relief to these individuals stuck in the employment-based Green Card backlog, thereby strengthening the economy in the process.They argued that under current law, the American economy is unable to access the full international talent pool of high-skilled workers already present and working in the United States today—indeed, the very scientists, inventors, health care workers, entrepreneurs, and other professionals that give the US its edge over its global competitors today.“This is because there is effectively a Green Card ban on high-skilled immigrants from India, China, and other countries with large populations of workers eager to remain in America and power forward our economy and social safety net programs for generations to come,” they said.This arbitrary cap is keeping some of the world’s most talented individuals from permanently calling America home, encouraging them to take their inventions, expertise, and creativity to other countries instead.Most workers in the employment-based Green Card backlog are already in the United States on temporary nonimmigrant visas such as the H-1B visa for workers in specialty occupations that are renewable but greatly restrict beneficiaries from reaching their full potential.Right now, no more than seven per cent of employment-based green cards are available to individuals from a single country, which has created a decades-long backlog for would-be immigrants from India and China.“Indian nationals face a particularly daunting backlog of 80 years, and an anticipated 200,000 will die before achieving lawful permanent resident status,” the lawmakers said.H-1B holders are unable to change jobs or start their own businesses—despite the fact that they have been shown to boost overall productivity, wages, and new patents, they said.The temporary nature of the H-1B visa forces beneficiaries to live in a constant state of uncertainty, preventing them from becoming entrepreneurs, buying homes, employing more Americans, or otherwise fully establishing themselves as permanent fixtures within the American economy.—     PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-bill-could-help-indians-get-us-green-card-by-paying-supplemental-fee-310588

He was a leader rooted to the ground and committed to the welfare of people. He will be deeply missed by all. Condolences to his family, friends and followers,” President Kovind tweeted.Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, AICC general Secretary (Karnataka) Randeep Surjewala and AICC general Secretary UP Priyanka Vadra also expressed grief.Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla tweeted his condolences too.My heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Shri Oscar Fernandes Ji. It is a personal loss for me. He was a guide and mentor to many of us in the Congress Party. He will be missed and fondly remembered for his contributions. pic.twitter.com/NZVD592GSJ  Oscar Fernandes ji was a guide, mentor, organizational builder; who connected to the Congress workers & they loved him in return.A “banyan tree” of the Congress Party has fallen. There will perhaps never be anyone like him.Our heartfelt homage to an eternal Congressman! pic.twitter.com/PHbl4WKy5d||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oscar-fernandes-long-time-rajiv-gandhi-aide-and-9-term-mp-dies-at-80-310562

Order is reserved,” a Bench led by CJI NV Ramana said after hearing arguments from various parties on the issue.The development came after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the government didn’t want to file any additional affidavit to publicly clarify if Pegasus spyware was used for snooping or not even as he maintained that the Centre had nothing to hide.“You have repeatedly been saying that the Government doesn’t want to file an affidavit. We also don’t want any security issues to be put before us. You say that a committee will be formed and the report will be submitted... We have to look into the whole issue and pass an interim order,” the Bench told Mehta.As Mehta insisted that the matter should be examined by a panel of experts and the report should be submitted to the top court and then the court could decide if the report would be put in the public domain or not, the Bench said such a decision would not take the issue anywhere.“Mr Mehta, you have been beating around the bush and that’s not the question here,” the Bench told the Solicitor General.Mehta said if there was a rethinking in the government on filing a detailed affidavit he would bring it to the court’s notice.“We are reserving orders. We will pass an interim order. It will take two-three days. If you have some re-thinking on this, you can mention the matter before us,” the Bench told the Solicitor General.On Mehta citing national security as a reason for not making it public,  the Bench said, “We are not interested to know about national interest issues… but we are only on the allegations that some software was used to snoop on certain citizens like lawyers etc. We wanted to know if it’s done to see and if it’s permissible under law.”On behalf of various petitioners, senior advocates Kapil Sibal, AM Singhvi, Shyam Divan, Rakesh Dwivedi, Meenakshi Arora and Colin Gonsalves insisted that the government must disclose if the controversial software was used in India or not as it’s a question of violation of fundamental rights of citizens.The top court had on August 17 asked the Centre to respond to petitions seeking an SIT probe into alleged snooping on politicians, journalists and activists using Pegasus spyware even as it clarified that it didn’t want the government to divulge anything which could adversely impact national security.Thereafter, the Centre had filed a short affidavit saying that the pleas seeking an independent probe into the Pegasus snooping allegations are based on “conjectures and surmises or on other unsubstantiated media reports or incomplete or uncorroborated material”.The Centre had said it was ready to set up an expert panel to dispel any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests. It had also said its position had already been clarified in Parliament by Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.On September 7, the court had deferred the hearing on the matter after the Centre sought time to decide if it would file a fresh affidavit in the matter.An international media consortium had reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware. It was also reported that phones of a former judge of the Supreme Court and its registrars were allegedly intercepted using the spyware.Around 10 petitioners, including the Editors Guild of India and senior journalists N Ram and others, have sought an independent probe into the alleged snooping on eminent citizens, politicians and scribes by using Israeli firm NSO’s spyware Pegasus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-snooping-scandal-sc-to-pass-an-interim-order-on-petitions-seeking-probe-310530
14-09-2021||Gandhinagar||Bhupendra Patel takes oath as Gujarat chief minister||First-term MLA Bhupendra Patel was on Monday sworn in as Gujarat chief minister, two days after Vijay Rupani's surprise exit from the post, a year ahead of the Assembly polls.Patel (59), unanimously elected BJP legislature party leader on Sunday, was sworn in as the state's 17th chief minister by Governor Acharya Devvrat at a simple ceremony here.Union Home Minister Amit Shah and chief ministers of some BJP-ruled states were among those present at the Raj Bhavan ceremony.As decided by the party, only Patel took the oath. The council of ministers will take oath during the next few days after their names are finalised, BJP sources said.The governor had on Sunday invited Patel to take oath as chief minister. "The new leader of BJP's Legislature Party Bhupendrabhai Patel presented a proposal to form the government under his leadership. Accepting the proposal, he was invited to take oath as CM on September 13 at 2.20 pm," Devvrat tweeted.At Sunday's legislature party meeting, the proposal to elect Patel the legislative party leader was moved by Vijay Rupani, whose resignation as CM on Saturday, 15 months ahead of the Assembly polls, surprised political observers.Rupani, the fourth chief minister to demit office in BJP-ruled states during the coronavirus pandemic, was sworn in as chief minister–his second stint as CM - in December 2017 and completed five years in office on August 7 this year.With state Assembly polls scheduled in December 2022, the BJP is banking on Patel, a Patidar, for poll victory. In the 2017 Assembly elections, the BJP won 99 of the 182 seats and Congress got 77.Born in Ahmedabad, Patel is an MLA from the Ghatlodia seat, previously held by former chief minister and now Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel.Patel, who holds a diploma in civil engineering, has served as Ahmedabad municipal councillor.Patel has never held a ministerial post, just like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was never a minister when he became Gujarat CM 20 years ago.
