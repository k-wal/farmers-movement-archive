Chappal Uthati Hai Hamari. Hum Log Hi Raji Ho Jate hai Uske Liye. (You do not know that bureaucracy is nothing. Bureaucracy is there to pick up our chappals (slippers). They pick up our slippers. We only got agreed for that),” she is heard saying in the video.The former Madhya Pradesh CM further said a government file moves only after a discussion between ministers concerned and bureaucrats.She said, “Do you think bureaucracy controls the leader?..no, first they talk (with us) in private, then bureaucracy makes a file and process it. I have been a minister at the Centre for 11 years, I have been a Chief Minister. First we (leaders and bureaucracy talk) discuss then a file moves.” After the clip surfaced, Bharti issued a clarification in a series of tweets, saying it was an informal interaction with a delegation of representatives from other backward classes (OBCs) at her home in Bhopal and the video of same went viral on social media.“I am thankful to the media that they showed my complete video because I was speaking only in defence of bureaucracy… Some of us leaders, the incompetent ones sitting in power, take the cover of bureaucracy to avoid their inefficiency to show that we are very good but bureaucracy does not allow us to do good work,” she said.Bharti said the truth “according to my experience is that honest bureaucracy supports a strong, true leader sitting in power having good intentions”.The BJP leader then went on to express regret for the kind of language she used against bureaucracy.“I regret that I used unrestrained language while my sentiments were good. I learned this lesson from today that modest language should be used even in informal conversations among limited people,” she said in another tweet. Senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Digvijaya Singh, in a tweet in Hindi, termed her comments as “highly objectionable”.Singh, a former CM, said bureaucracy is committed to work impartially under the Constitution.

20-09-2021||New Delhi||FSSAI plans to introduce ‘front of package label’ to regulate junk foods||Expressing concern over increasing consumption of junk food leading to obesity in youth and children in India, FSSAI CEO Arun Singhal on Monday said there is a plan to introduce front-of-package (FoP) labeling on packaged foods to help consumers make healthier food choices. IIM Ahmedabad has been asked to conduct a survey on the nature of FoP labels in the interest of consumers, he said on the occasion of 15th anniversary of formation of FSSAI here.Front of Package labels seek to provide simple nutrition information in a more accessible location instead on the back or side of packages. Asserting that the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is capable of introducing this kind of label in India, the CEO said it has become necessary as obesity along with malnutrition is also a big problem in the country especially in youth and children.“There is a rise in demand for packaged food. There is a need to provide information in a simple way about the impact of packaged food on health so that consumers can make choices,” Singhal said. He also mentioned that many countries which used FoP labels saw reduction in consumption of junk food. The CEO said several deliberations have been held with stakeholders. A consensus has been arrived at on most issues after elaborate consultations with the industry and consumers, who had different opinions of this issue initially.“The technical issues have been settled, but only one issue is left, that is, the nature of the FoP label. For this, IIM Ahmedabad has been asked to conduct a survey,” he said.The IIM (A) has started the work. After the findings of the survey, the FSSAI will draft the regulations, he added.

Saffron leaders, who claim that “it will not be easy for the Congress to handle the change with Assembly elections barely a couple of months away”, intend to keep up the pressure against the new CM.As they renewed the “MeToo” campaign against Channi, observers said Channi is “way too close to Navjot Singh Sidhu” and the elections “far too near” for him to “have an easy way in the run-up”.Meanwhile, some in the saffron camp also believe the President’s Rule and early elections as among the possibilities for Punjab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-in-touch-with-congress-unhappy-lot-in-punjab-313812
20-09-2021||New Delhi||Dalits are mere political pawns in Congress’ devious politics, says BJP on Channi’s appointment as Punjab CM||The BJP on Monday accused the Congress of using “Dalits like pawns” and indulging in “dikhawe ka Dalit prem”, challenging it to “guarantee” that the chief minister of “six months” Charanjit Singh Channi will “not be dropped” in favour of someone else after elections.With the Dalit politics gaining steam ahead of crucial elections next year, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who is facing a tough challenge in his state that polls along with Punjab, also tweeted a series of messages, highlighting the importance the community has in the BJP and their contribution towards nation building.Meanwhile, BJP IT cell in charge Amit Malviya called Dalits “mere political pawns in Congress’ devious politics. In Punjab, they claim to have made a Dalit CM, only to be posted as a night watchman, till Gandhi family loyalist (Navjot Singh) Sidhu takes over, but maintains deafening silence over lynching of a Dalit youth in Rajasthan”.“This completely undermines the Dalit empowerment narrative being peddled by the Congress. Shame,” said Malviya, while Kaushambhi MP Vinod Sonkar accused the ruling party in Punjab of indulging in “dikhawa ka Dalit-prem”.Listing leaders from the Dalit community it “ditched” and “ill-treated” in the past, Sonkar said: “The Congress may have forgotten how it treated Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar or stopped Babu Jagjivan Ram from becoming the Prime Minister, people have not.“This is not the first time they have shown false Dalit-prem for the sake of political gains. In Maharashtra (2003-04) they appointed Sushil Kumar Shinde the CM before the elections and dropped him in favour of Vilasrao Deshmukh after winning. The party gave a similar treatment to Jagannath Pahadia in Rajasthan in 1980. They contested under him but appointed Shivcharan Mathur after elections. If their intentions are clean, they should guarantee that they will not drop Channi after elections,” said Sonkar.As the BJP also raked up “Me Too” allegations against the new CM while National Commission for Women chairperson Rekha Sharma termed him “threat to women”, observers said Channi is “way too close to Navjot Singh Sidhu” and the elections “far too near” for him to be “ignored” by any party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dalits-are-mere-political-pawns-in-congress-devious-politics-says-bjp-on-channis-appointment-as-punjab-cm-313811
20-09-2021||London||London home where Tagore worked on ‘Gitanjali’ translation for sale||A family home in the leafy Hampstead neighbourhood of north London where Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore lived during a visit in 1912 is on the market, reviving some talk of its acquisition on behalf of the Indian government.Tagore had lived at Heath Villas in Hampstead Heath, north London, for a few months while he translated his famous collection of poems ‘Gitanjali’.During her visit to the UK in 2015 and then again in 2017, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had asked the Indian High Commission in London to look into acquiring the property on behalf of the Bengal government to convert into a museum-cum-memorial to the world-famous poet and writer.“From our point of view, we are in the business of selling and as long as our client gets the value they seek and it meets all requirements under British law, all offers are welcome,” said Philip Green, director of Goldschmidt & Howland, the estate agents handling the sale.“It is a wonderful home in a spectacular part of London and we are privileged to be handling the sale. Its historical significance is recognised with the Blue Plaque but besides that, there has been a lot of interest because of its unique location, period features and beautiful views of the Heath,” he said.The three-bedroom terrace house is on the market for GBP 2,699,500 and is described online as a stylish Grade II listed Victorian Villa built circa 1863. The building’s Blue Plaque, a scheme run by the English Heritage charity to honour notable people and organisations associated with particular buildings across London, reads “Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) Indian poet stayed here in 1912”.Goldschmidt & Howland, operating in the area since 1888, said there is some precedent of English Heritage recognised homes being converted into buildings of wider public interest, including the Freud Museum in north London – where neurologist Sigmund Freud lived.“Of course, all the relevant planning laws and permissions would be required, through planning law experts, but there is certainly precedence for this,” said Philip Green.Tagore had set sail for England from India in 1912 and was known to have translated many of his works while in London. His company at the time included famous British artists and poets, including W B Yeats who also wrote the introduction to ‘Gitanjali’ – the collection of 103 translations which went on to win Tagore his Nobel Prize for Literature the next year in 1913.A number of Tagore’s plays were performed in London by British and Indian troupes and he was to return to the UK a few more times until 1931. A bronze statue of Tagore, commissioned by Tagore Centre UK and unveiled by Prince Charles in 2011, stands at Gordon Square in central London.The Indian High Commission in London said it is so far unaware of any renewed interest in the property from the West Bengal government.

20-09-2021||New Delhi||Development of ties with China can only be based on ‘3 mutuals’: FS Shringla||India has made it clear to China that peace and tranquillity in border areas are essential for the development of bilateral ties and that it can only be based on ‘three mutuals’—mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Monday.He said as an immediate neighbour of Afghanistan, India is naturally concerned about the recent changes in that country and their implications for the region and that India’s friendship with Afghan people will continue to guide its approach in the future.In an address at the sixth J P Morgan ‘India Investor Summit’, Shringla said the situation in India’s neighbourhood, particularly in Afghanistan, and with China on the eastern borders reminds us that while the new realities are making themselves felt, traditional security challenges remain.Talking about “megatrends”, he listed the phenomenon of rebalancing in which global activity is moving towards Asia, the rise of China and the pressure on the international systems among others.On New Delhi’s ties with Beijing, he said Chinese attempts over the last year to “unilaterally” alter the status quo in Ladakh have “seriously disturbed” peace and tranquillity in the border areas.“These acts are in violation of our bilateral agreements and have inevitably impacted other aspects of the bilateral relationship,” he said, referring to the eastern Ladakh border standoff.“We have made it clear to the Chinese side that peace and tranquillity in border areas are essential for the development of our relationship. Development of India-China relationship can only be based on ‘three mutuals’-- mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests,” he added.Shringla said an essential basis for the largely positive trajectory of India-China relations during the last 40 years has been the agreement between the two countries to ensure peace and tranquillity in the border areas.On the situation in Afghanistan, he referred to the recent UN Security Council resolution 2693 and said it demanded that Afghan territory should not be used for sheltering, training, planning or financing terrorist acts and also specifically refers to terrorists proscribed by the global body including those from Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).“As an immediate neighbour, we are naturally concerned about the recent changes within Afghanistan and their implications for us and the region,” Shringla said.The foreign secretary said India’s immediate focus was on the evacuation of its nationals from Afghanistan and that most of them were able to leave Kabul in August along with a number of Afghans, including minorities.“However, this process could not be completed due to the security situation at the airport. Resumption of flights from Kabul airport is, therefore, a priority. We are closely monitoring the unfolding situation,” Shringla said.Elaborating on the UN Security Council resolution on Afghanistan, he noted that it was adopted under India’s presidency of the global body and that it comprehensively addressed the main pending issues relating to that country.The foreign secretary said India is also monitoring developments related to the humanitarian needs of Afghanistan.In UNDP’s assessment, there is an imminent threat of poverty levels rising in Afghanistan besides a threat of an imminent drought and a food security crisis, he said.“It is important for the humanitarian assistance providers to be given unrestricted and direct access to Afghanistan,” the foreign secretary said.He also underlined the need to ensure that the distribution of humanitarian assistance is done in a “non-discriminatory manner” to all sections of Afghan society.“India’s approach to Afghanistan has been guided by our civilisational relationship with the Afghan people. We have extended over USD 3 billion as development assistance for the welfare of the people of Afghanistan,” he said.Referring to the recent in-person Quad summit, Shringla said the agenda of cooperation under this framework is constructive and diverse.“The four Quad countries are engaged on issues of connectivity and infrastructure, emerging technologies, climate action, education, and most important of all, Covid-19 responses – which include vaccines collaboration, and resilient and reliable supply chains,” he said.He said India is involved in multiple initiatives, within the framework of Quad and with Quad countries individually, on supply chain resilience.

20-09-2021||New Delhi||NEET-SS 2021: SC agrees to hear plea against ‘last-minute’ changes in exam pattern||The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a plea challenging the alleged “last-minute” changes made to the examination pattern for the upcoming National Eligibility cum Entrance Test - Super Specialization (NEET-SS) 2021 which is scheduled in November.A Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna issued notice and sought responses from the Centre, National Board of Examinations (NBE) and National Medical Commission (NMC) on the plea filed by 41 post-graduate doctors.The apex court, which posted the matter for further hearing on September 27, also permitted the petitioners to file brief note of their written submissions.The petitioners, who are qualified post-graduate doctors from across the country and are aspiring to become super specialists by cracking the NEET-SS 2021, have said the dates for the examination was announced on July 23 but the changed pattern was made public on August 31.Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the petitioners, said the NEET-SS 2021 exams are scheduled on November 13-14 and it is fairly settled principle including in educational matter that once the calendar is announced, there is no question of then altering the scheme.The plea, filed through advocate Javedur Rahman, has sought quashing of the scheme of NEET-SS 2021 contained in the August 31 information bulletin, as notified by the NBE and approved by the NMC, alleging it to be “illegal” having been carried out without any authority of law.“As per the existing/earlier pattern 40 marks use to be come from the base subject and 60 marks were in respect of the two optional courses opted by the aspirant. This was very important since the candidate themselves would choose the fields of their interest and not only obtain theoretical knowledge of it but will be engaged in acquiring practical knowledge of the same,” it said.The plea claimed that the information bulletin has “completely transformed” the entrance examination and the NBE has stated that the exam would be of the “level of exit exam of post-graduation”.“Thus, post-graduates from different broad specialities can appear for a single super-speciality exam,” it said.The plea said the erstwhile pattern had a paper with 60 per cent questions from critical care, that is the super-specialty subject, and 40 per cent were mixed questions from all the five broad specialties, including General Medicine and Anaesthesiology, ensuring a “level-playing field”.“The proposed new pattern is forcing all the candidates from above-mentioned broad specialties to write a single paper which will have 100 per cent questions from General Medicine. There will be no questions from broad specialties of other four post-graduate branches. The pattern is not just a waste of time and effort for all those who have prepared for critical care but also grossly biased against few broad specialties,” it claimed.The plea has also sought direction restoring the pattern of exam for NEET-SS 2021 and in the alternative, directing that the changes in the scheme shall not be implemented in this year exam on account of paucity of time but be implemented in 2022 and onwards.“The petitioners were surprised to see the scheme of the NEET-SS exams in part 4, having undergone a complete change without any sort of advance intimation, with only two months left for the exam whilst the petitioners have all along been preparing in terms of the extant pattern/scheme of the exam, having absolutely no reason to think that any such drastic change will be made so close to the specified date and without the lawful authority i.e. the Central Government directing to do so,” it said.It said the petitioners, who have had the “most challenging experiences” of their professional lives in this time being at the forefront of the battle against Covid-19, have all through this period prepared for NEET-SS 2021 exam legitimately expecting that the pattern is unchanged, just like it was in the previous three years. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/neet-ss-2021-sc-agrees-to-hear-plea-against-last-minute-changes-in-exam-pattern-313797

20-09-2021||Mumbai||Concerned about media reports on Shilpa Shetty’s kids after Kundra’s arrest, says HC||The Bombay High Court on Monday said it was concerned about media reports on actor Shilpa Shetty’s minor children following the arrest of her businessman husband Raj Kundra in connection with the production and distribution of pornographic movies.Justice Gautam Patel was hearing a suit filed by Shetty against the alleged defamatory articles and videos published against her and her family after Kundra’s arrest in July.Shetty, in her plea, had sought that the media be restrained from publishing “incorrect, false, malicious and defamatory” content.The court had, in July, said it cannot pass a blanket gag order on the media on reporting anything against Shetty. However, it had directed for three videos uploaded on YouTube to be deleted.On Monday, Shetty’s counsel, Abhinav Chandrachud, told the court they were in talks with most of the defendants (media outlets and private persons running blogs and vlogs), and many of them had agreed to remove objectionable posts.The Bench, while posting the matter for further hearing on October 1, directed the plaintiff to segregate the defendants into two categories – private vloggers and bloggers, and traditional media outlets.“Traditional media will understand rationale and competent advice. We cannot say the same about these private vloggers and bloggers,” Justice Patel said.The court also asked Chandrachud why the plaintiff was in a rush for the plea to be heard.“You (Shetty) are not going to be able to get a permanent injunction (against media reports), then why are you in a rush? This matter pertaining to Raj Kundra is going to go on for some more time,” Justice Patel said.“I am not concerned about Shilpa Shetty…she will handle herself. I am more concerned about her minor children. Media reports on Shetty’s personal life with her children are of concern…in such matters, it is the children who are in the centre,” Justice Patel said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/concerned-about-media-reports-on-shilpa-shettys-kids-after-kundras-arrest-says-hc-313791

The complainant claims he was seeking a Congress ticket and he has named leaders of our party as accused.”The Congress has been an old ally of the RJD and the two parties had fought the Lok Sabha elections in alliance.RJD’s sitting MP Shailesh Kumar alias Bulo Mandal had contested the Bhagalpur seat and lost to JD(U)’s Ajay Mandal.Leaders of the state Congress have so far been tight-lipped on the complainant’s proclaimed association with the party.

Therefore an emergency removal of mucor infected areas was planned," Dr Ujjwal Parakh, Senior Consultant, Department of Chest Medicine, at SGRH, said in a statement.Since mucor is a fast spreading disease and could further damage other organs, a part of his left lung and the entire right kidney was removed immediately as a life saving procedure. The complicated surgery lasted for six hours."It was a complicated case in which Mucor had penetrated part of the lung and kidney. The involvement of the kidney was total, and the kidney had become non functional. During surgery the fungus was found almost spreading to the liver, and the large intestine. Thus with great difficulty, the kidney could be removed without injuring the adjacent organs," added Dr Manu Gupta, Consultant, Department of Urology, at the hospital.Post the surgery, which lasted six hours, Singh was put on oral antifungal medicine for a few weeks.He was "discharged after 45 days of prolonged anti-fungal therapy. He is doing well now", Parakh said.Mucormycosis is labelled as a rare and emerging fungal infection. India always has had the highest reported numbers of mucormycosis in the world, but when coupled with Covid-19 it became a disease of epidemic proportions in several Indian states during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic.Till May 19, approximately 5,500 people were affected with Covid-19 Associated Mucormycosis (CAM) in India, resulting in 126 casualties.India contributed to approximately 71 per cent of the global cases of CAM based on the published literature from December 2019 to the start of April 2021.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-hospital-treats-1st-case-of-black-fungus-in-kidney-lungs-post-covid-313768

He said that most of the clan members were farm workers and extremely poor.Rind said the accused landlords were notorious for picking up fights with other villagers over petty issues. He promised free legal aid for the complainant family, the report said.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan. According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents. They often complain of harassment by extremists. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hindu-family-in-pak-tortured-held-hostage-for-fetching-drinking-water-from-mosque-313744

If that was the case, for so many years, I have read at least 6,000 books," Dixit said.He continued, "Gandhiji used to dress scantily. He used to wrap just a 'dhoti'. The country called him Bapu. If somebody could become great just by taking their clothes off, then Rakhi Sawant would have become greater than Mahatma Gandhi."A video clip of his speech went viral on social media, following which he put out a series of clarifying tweets in Hindi."Some friends on social media are showing the clip of a video of my speech with an otherwise meaning.

Business leaders, whom Deloitte surveyed, are preparing to make additional and first-time investments in India," Renjen told PTI.The CEO of the top multinational professional services network said, "FDI, I believe, is the key to India's aspiration to be a USD 5 trillion economy and I think that is eminently doable. I am certainly a very big proponent of India and what can be accomplished."   The fourth key takeaway from the survey was the value of the skilled workforce and prospects for economic growth, particularly domestic. These are important attractors for FDI, he said.Also, it is still believed that India is a challenging place to do business. This perception is due to low awareness about government programmes, incentives and reforms, particularly those that have just been announced by the government, he said."Of 1,200 business leaders surveyed in the US, the UK, Japan and Singapore, 44 per cent are planning additional or first-time investments in India. Among the first-time investors, nearly two-third are planning to do so within the next two years," Renjen said.The Deloitte CEO noted that although there is a significant crossover, access to India's domestic market is very important in addition to the country being an export hub.         But the attraction of the domestic market is very important for FDI investment, he said, adding, "Business leaders rated India higher on economic growth and skilled workforce, which are great attractors."

The first ministerial visit from Saudi Arabia to India since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic took place against the backdrop of both countries having to witness the developments in Afghanistan from the sidelines.Both ministers discussed all issues related to their bilateral relationship and regional and international issues of mutual interest, said an MEA statement. They also exchanged views on developments in Afghanistan besides other regional issues and discussed bilateral cooperation at multilateral forums such as UN, G-20 and the GCC.Drawing on the Strategic Partnership Council Agreement signed during the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Saudi Arabia in 2019, they discussed further steps to strengthen their partnership in trade, investment, energy, defence, security, culture, consular issues, healthcare and human resources.However, there appeared to be no breakthrough in allowing Indian expatriates to travel to Saudi Arabia, especially those who have taken Covaxin shots.The MEA said Jaishankar urged Saudi Arabia to further relax restrictions on travel from India. Thousands of Indian expatriates stranded here have been urging the MEA to find a solution to their woes.Jaishankar had a telephonic conversation with Prince Faisal's deputy on August 27 with easier travel for Indians to Saudi Arabia being the main topic.At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Bishkek on Friday, Foreign Ministers of China, Russia, Pakistan and Iran had a meeting to the exclusion of India, the other major country in the grouping.That these countries intend to control events in Afghanistan was apparent from Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi' five-point proposal on coordination and cooperation among the four countries for the next stage.Similarly, Saudi Arabia has remained out of the picture whereas its much smaller neighbours UAE, Qatar and Bahrain played a leading role in evacuations and have also been sending humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.PM to decide on infra investment: GadkariNew Delhi: Union minister Nitin Gadkari has said the final decision on continuing infrastructure investments in Afghanistan will be taken by PM Modi.Stay indoors: Taliban to working womenKabul: Women employees of the Kabul city government have been told to stay home, with work only allowed for those who cannot be replaced by men. world||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-saudi-fm-talk-covid-curbs-afghanistan-313440

Following this, the central forces in internal security have started allocating PAGs to those units that are vulnerable to drone threats, including those deployed in naxal areas.“Till a complete technology solution is found for effectively checking and neutralising drones, the security forces have been asked to use what is available with them, like the PAGs. Those who do not have adequate numbers of these non-lethal weapons have been asked to procure them,” a senior MHA official.He said the security units deployed in counter-terrorism operations in Kashmir and those guarding airport boundaries had also been asked to provide these arms to their sentries. “It has been found that rubber pellets fired by PAGs can effectively bring down a drone flying at a low of about 60-100 meters from the ground and attempting to either drop a bomb or conduct reconnaissance of the camp area or installation,” the official said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/border-guarding-forces-to-use-rubber-bullets-to-down-drones-313501

The first ministerial visit from Saudi Arabia to India since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic took place against the backdrop of both countries having to witness the developments in Afghanistan from the sidelines.Both ministers discussed all issues related to their bilateral relationship and regional and international issues of mutual interest, said an MEA statement.They also exchanged views on the developments in Afghanistan and other regional issues and discussed bilateral cooperation in multilateral forums such as UN, G-20 and GCC.Drawing on the Strategic Partnership Council Agreement signed during the visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Saudi Arabia in 2019, they discussed further steps to strengthen their partnership in trade, investment, energy, defence, security, culture, consular issues, health care and human resources.However, there appeared to be no breakthrough in allowing Indian expatriates to travel to Saudi Arabia, especially those who have taken Covaxin shots. The MEA said Jaishankar urged Saudi Arabia to further relax restrictions on travel from India. Thousands of Indian expatriates stranded here have been urging MEA to find a solution to their woes. Jaishankar had a telephonic conversation with Prince Faisal’s deputy on August 27 with easier travel for Indians to Saudi Arabia being the main topic.At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Bishkek on Friday, Foreign Ministers of China, Russia, Pakistan and Iran had a meeting to the exclusion of India, the other major country in the grouping. That these countries intend to control events in Afghanistan was apparent from Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s five-point proposal on coordination and cooperation among the four countries for the next stage. Similarly, Saudi Arabia has remained out of the picture whereas it’s much smaller neighbours UAE, Qatar and Bahrain played a leading role in evacuations and has also been sending humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-saudi-foreign-minister-talk-afghanistan-return-of-expatriates-313399
