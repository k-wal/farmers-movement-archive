Then, he tried to commit suicide by sitting his throat,” the official said.Thursday’s incident sent chills down the spine of the locals reminding them of the horrifying murder of a 24-year-old techie Swathi on the morning of June 24, 2016, at the Nungambakkam railway station here by a youth Ramkumar from Tirunelveli. Days after he was arrested Ramkumar allegedly killed himself in prison.AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam condemned the murder of the girl student of a private college and said incidents like these are “very distressing”. “Hearing the news of the student’s murder in broad daylight has caused great anguish… It is distressing that rise in the incidents of murders has caused insecurity and apprehension among women,” he said in a statement here.Panneerselvam urged the police to expeditiously arrest the man responsible for the murder of the college student and punish him for the offence. He conveyed his heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the bereaved members of the girl’s family. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-stabs-college-student-to-death-in-tn-tries-to-kill-self-315203

The Director General, National Informatics Centre, Secretary (Home) of all the states/UTs and the Director General/Inspector General of prisons of all the states/UTs shall ensure smooth and successful implementation of FASTER system and shall coordinate with the Registry of this court in this regard,” it ordered.In order to ensure faster communication and compliance of its orders, the top court has undertaken a project—Fast and Secure Transmission of Electronic Records (FASTER). States have already appointed nodal officers for its smooth functioning, it noted.Noting that requisite amendment in the rules and procedure for the Supreme Court will be taken up on the administrative side, the Bench said “all the duty-holders shall amend their rules/procedure/practice/directions forthwith, to recognize thee-authenticated copy of the order of this Court communicated to them through FASTER system and shall comply with the directions contained therein.”Earlier, the top court had on July 16 taken suo motu cognizance of delay in release of convicts even after grant of bail due to non-receipt or non-verification of the judicial orders. It had asked the SC Secretary General to frame a scheme in consultation with amicus curiae and senior advocate Dushaynt Dave and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta for setting up a “secure, credible and authentic channel” for transmission of the orders for execution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-orders-states-uts-to-ensure-internet-facility-with-adequate-speed-in-all-jails-315198
23-09-2021||New Delhi||NCDRC grants Rs 2 crore compensation to model for wrong haircut||The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) has directed a luxury hotel chain to pay a compensation of Rs two crores to a woman after a salon at their Delhi-based hotel allegedly gave her a wrong haircut and hair treatment, observing that it shattered her dream to become a top model. A Bench of President RK Agrawal and Member Dr SM Kantikar awarded compensation after noting that women are no doubt cautious about their hair, spend a handsome amount on keeping them in good condition, and are emotionally attached to them.The commission noted that complainant Aashna Roy was a model for hair products because of her long hair and had done modelling for big hair-care brands but due to haircutting against her instructions, she lost her expected assignments and suffered a huge loss which completely changed her lifestyle and shattered her dream to be a top model.“She was also working as a senior management professional and earning a decent income. She underwent severe mental breakdown and trauma due to negligence in cutting her hair and could not concentrate on her job and finally, she lost her job,” the Bench said in an order dated September 21.Apart from this, the hotel is also guilty of medical negligence in hair treatment, the commission said, adding that her scalp was burnt and there is still allergy and itching due to the fault of the staff.A bare perusal of the WhatsApp chat adduced by the complainant reveals that the hotel had admitted the fault on their part and by offering the free hair treatment tried to cover it, the NCDRC added.“The complaint is allowed partly and we are of the considered view that it would meet the end of justice in case the complainant is granted compensation of Rs 2,00,00,000. Hence, we direct the Opposite Party No.2 to pay a compensation of to the Complainant within eight weeks,” it ordered.In April 2018, complainant Aashna Roy visited a salon at the Delhi-based hotel a week before an interview and specifically asked for “long flicks covering her face in the front and at the back and four-inch straight hair trim from the bottom”.However, she alleged that the hairdresser did not abide by her instruction and chopped off her entire hair leaving only four inches from the top and barely touching her shoulders.She complained about this to the management of the Salon, who in turn offered her a free hair treatment, which she claimed caused permanent damage due to excess ammonia, which resulted in excessive irritation in her scalp.She brought the incident to the notice of the higher authorities of the hotel but “in vain”.“Rather, they misbehaved and threatened her to face consequences,” Roy said and knocked on the doors of NCDRC seeking a written apology from the management as well as compensation of Rs 3 crores for harassment, humiliation, and mental trauma.She claimed that she stopped seeking herself in the mirror, avoided social activities, lost her self-confidence due to little hair.She also suffered a loss of income due to a mental breakdown and left her job, which Roy submitted before the commission.However, the counsel appearing for the hotel chain, submitted that the entire hair of the complainant was not chopped off, they were cut as per her request, and that during the hair treatment no harm was caused to her scalp with the excess ammonia.The counsel submitted that the complainant is not a “Consumer” as no consideration was paid by her for hair cutting as the payment was declined and the hair treatment was also provided to her free of charge.The hotel claimed that Roy filed the complaint with a mala fide intention to malign its reputation and goodwill and to extract unreasonably high and exaggerated compensation. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncdrc-grants-rs-2-crore-compensation-to-model-for-wrong-haircut-315194

Neither side raised technical concerns with each other’s certification process. An important step forward in our joint aim to facilitate travel and fully protect public health of UK and India,” British high commissioner to India Alex Ellis tweeted after meeting Sharma.The meeting came hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing the global Covid-19 summit called for international travel to be enabled through mutual recognition of vaccine certificates.Sharma reciprocated to Ellis’ tweet saying “We echo the views of the British high commissioner. This will be instrumental in resuming socio economic activities between India and UK. We also look forward to deepening ties between the Indian National Health Authority and its British counterpart as we collaborate to build a digital continuum of healthcare services.”Earlier today, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan had said that the UK’s travel dispensation proposed to be implemented from October 4 was discriminatory. “Both sides are in dialogue and we believe there will be a quick resolution of the issue. We reserve the right to reciprocate in a similar fashion,” Bhushan said.No tabs on WHO meet on Covaxin: CentreThe Health Ministry said it could not comment on the dates of WHO expert committee meeting that decided on the inclusion of Covid vaccines in the emergency use listing as this was WHO’s own prerogative. “WHO SAGE is a scientific group. We won’t comment on the date and timing of its meeting,” Bhushan said when asked if the meeting was scheduled for October 5 to decide on India made Covaxin approval.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-technical-concern-on-covid-vaccine-certification-british-envoy-after-meeting-cowin-chief-315186

23-09-2021||New Delhi||Patent fees for educational institutions reduced by 80 per cent||The government on Thursday decreased the processing and patent filing fees, charged on educational institutions, by 80 per cent.“Benefits related to 80 per cent reduced fee for patent filing and prosecution have been extended to educational institutions as well. The Centre has notified the amendments to the Patents Rules in this regard,” an official statement said.Educational institutions engage in many research activities, where professors/teachers and students generate several new technologies which need to be patented to facilitate commercialisation of the same.“High patenting fees present a restrictive element for getting these technologies patented and thus work as a disincentive for development of new technologies,” it added.“At the time of applying for patents, the innovators have to apply these patents in the name of the institutions that have to pay fees for large applicants, which are very high and thus work as a disincentive.“In this regard and to encourage greater participation of the educations institutions, who play a pivotal role in country’s innovation, official fees payable by them in respect of various acts under the Patents Rules, 2003, have been reduced by way of the Patents (Amendment) Rules, 2021, which came into effect on 21 September 2021,” the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/patent-fees-for-educational-institutions-reduced-by-80-per-cent-315177

23-09-2021||London||Vaccine certification for travel must meet ‘minimum criteria’, says UK||The UK government has said that Covid-19 vaccine certification from all countries must meet a “minimum criteria” and that it is working with India on a “phased approach” to its international travel norms.It follows Covishield, the Serum Institute of India manufactured Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, being added as eligible to an expanded UK travel advisory on Wednesday.But with India’s vaccine certification not on a list of 18 approved countries, Indian travellers to the UK will continue to be treated as non-vaccinated and therefore required to quarantine for 10 days on arrival.Following much confusion over this process, UK government sources said on Wednesday night that additions or changes to the approved country listings are being kept under “regular consideration”, but there was no further clarity on the required criteria for approving a country’s vaccine certification.“As part of our recently expanded inbound vaccination policy, we recognise the following vaccines Pfizer BioNTech, Oxford AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen (J&J), for the purposes of international travel. This now includes the formulations AstraZeneca Covishield, AstraZeneca Vaxzevria and Moderna Takeda,” a UK government spokesperson said.“Our top priority remains protecting public health, and reopening travel in a safe and sustainable way, which is why vaccine certification from all countries must meet the minimum criteria taking into account public health and wider considerations. We continue to work with international partners, including India, to roll out our phased approach,” the spokesperson said.Travellers who are not fully vaccinated, or vaccinated in a country such as India currently not on the UK government’s recognised list, must take a pre-departure test, pay for day two and day eight PCR tests after arrival in England and self-isolate for 10 days, with an option to “test to release” after five days following a negative PCR test.With reference to an outcry over India’s vaccination certification not being recognised despite Covishield being one of two main Covid-19 vaccines administered in India, UK government sources would only say that the rollout of its inbound vaccination programme to other countries and territories was always intended as a “phased approach”, building on the success of pilots with the US and Europe.The 18 countries currently on the UK government’s approved inbound vaccinations list besides the US and Europe include: Australia, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Bahrain, Brunei, Canada, Dominica, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Malaysia, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Talks are being held in New Delhi between British officials and National Health Authority representatives, led by CEO RS Sharma, in an attempt to resolve India’s omission from this list.“Excellent technical discussions with @rssharma @AyushmanNHA. Neither side raised technical concerns with each other’s certification process. An important step forward in our joint aim to facilitate travel and fully protect public health of UK and India,” British High Commissioner to India Alex Ellis tweeted on Thursday.From October 4, England’s traffic light system of red, amber and green countries based on levels of Covid-19 risk is to be officially scrapped. However, despite Covishield now being recognised within the UK’s eligible vaccine formulations, it would not offer any advantage to Covishield-vaccinated Indian travellers planning a UK visit.The Indian government has expressed its strong condemnation of such a move and warned of “reciprocal measures” if vaccinated travellers from India continued to be treated in a “discriminatory” way.At a Global Covid summit hosted by US President Joe Biden on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated that international travel should be made easier through “mutual recognition of vaccine certificates”. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccine-certification-for-travel-must-meet-minimum-criteria-says-uk-315166
23-09-2021||Satya Prakash||SC happy with Rs 50,000 ex gratia to be paid to families of Covid-19 victims||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 23The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed satisfaction over the government’s decision to provide an ex-gratia amount of Rs 50,000 to the families of those who died due to Covid-19."Today we are very happy. There will be some solace to those who have suffered…We are happy that something is being done to wipe out the tears of the persons who suffered", a Bench led by Justice MR Shah said. "We have to take judicial notice of the fact that what India has done, no other country could do,” it added.Expressing satisfaction over the compensation proposed to be paid to families of Covid-19 victims, the Bench said it will pass orders in the matter on October 4.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the National disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has framed guidelines for payment of ex-gratia compensation to the families of Covid-19 victims by states from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). "We cannot repair the loss, but we can do something,” he said.India has so far recorded 4.46 lakh deaths due to Covid-19 which was declared a disaster under the Disaster Management Act.The Centre had on Wednesday told the top court that families of Covid-19 victims, including those involved in relief operations, will be given Rs 50,000 compensation from the SDRF.The families of those who died of Covid-19 will have to apply for compensation in the Disaster Management Office of their respective district along with a medical/death certificate mentioning 'death due to corona'.The compensation will be paid against not only the deaths that have already occurred but for future ones, the Centre said.The top court had on June 30 directed the NDMA to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to the kin of those who died due to Covid, saying the authority was statutorily mandated to provide minimum relief, including ex-gratia to the victims of the pandemic.Holding that by not providing an ex-gratia amount, the NDMA had failed in discharging its statutory duty, a Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan had directed the NDMA to determine in six weeks the ex-gratia amount to be paid to the family of each Covid victim.However, it had said it won’t be proper for the court to direct a particular amount to be paid.The order had come on PILs seeking an ex-gratia compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to the kin of those who lost their lives due to Covid pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-happy-with-rs-50-000-ex-gratia-to-be-paid-to-families-of-covid-19-victims-315165

We can now say that the period of extension will be upto October 1," the CJI said, reserving its order.Agreeing with the CJI's suggestion, Attorney General KK Venugopal said he was not in favour of further extension of limitation period.He said there were no containment zones in the country and, therefore, the indefinite relaxation in limitation period granted since March 15, 2020 due to the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown might be withdrawn.The Bench said it would pass a detailed order using its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution.As second wave of Covid hit India, the top court had on April 27 extended the limitation period for filing cases/appeals under various central and state laws until further orders.The order would mitigate the hardships faced by litigants and lawyers due to the second wave of the pandemic that had created an alarming situation, it had noted."For the past few weeks we have witnessed the second wave of Covid.

US President Joe Biden is hosting the first in-person Quad summit at the White House on September 24."On Friday… you'll have the Australians there (for the Quad summit).

JAIAUKUS?” Psaki said in lighter moments before giving answer to the question.The trilateral security alliance AUKUS, seen as an effort to counter China in the Indo-Pacific, will allow the US and the UK to provide Australia with the technology to develop nuclear-powered submarines for the first time.China has sharply criticised the trilateral alliance, saying such exclusive grouping has no future and will gravely undermine regional stability and aggravate the arms race and hurt international non-proliferation efforts.

The petitioner had also lodged a complaint alleging that the toll company staff had assaulted him over the matter of paying Rs 20 toll fee.The bench also observed that the petition was filed with an intention of enmity and there was no public interest in it. The bench quashed the petition and fined Rs 25,000.The petitioner at this stage submitted to the court that he had not filed the petition with self-interest and it was filed in the interest of the public. He also told the court that he is ready to face investigation and if he is proved to have submitted the petition on self interest he would pay Rs 50,000 fine instead of Rs 25,000.The bench gave another order that since the petitioner himself has agreed to pay Rs 50,000 fine, the fine amount is increased from Rs 25,000 to Rs 50,000 and quashed the petition.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-fines-petitioner-rs-50k-for-filing-pil-with-intention-of-enmity-315116

23-09-2021||Washington||Modi to interact with global CEOs to highlight opportunities in India||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he would highlight economic opportunities in India during his meetings with CEOs here.On Thursday, the prime minister is scheduled to hold one-on-one meetings with top five American CEOs.Two of them are Indian-Americans -- Shantanu Narayen from Adobe and Vivek Lall from General Atomics. The three others being Cristiano E Amon from Qualcomm, Mark Widmar from First Solar, and Stephen A Schwarzman from Blackstone.“Landed in Washington DC. Over the next two days, will be meeting President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Prime Ministers Scott Morrison from Australia and Yoshihide Suga from Japan," he tweeted.“Will attend the Quad meeting and would also interact with leading CEOs to highlight economic opportunities in India,” he said.The prime minister's meeting with American CEOs from five different key areas is reflective of the priorities of his government. While Narayen reflects the IT and digital priority that the Indian government is pushing for, Modi's meeting with Lall is significant as General Atomics is not only the pioneer in military drone technologies but also the world's top manufacturer of state-of-the-art military drones, which the US shares only with its key allies and partners.India is in the process of procuring a significant number of drones for the three branches of its armed forces. It has also leased a few drones from General Atomics.Jakarta-born Vivek Lall, now based out of California, for over a decade has been instrumental in major bilateral defence deals worth around USD18 billion, as India and the US take steps to forge a new relationship in which defence trade is a key pillar.The meeting with chip giant Cristiano Amon assumes significance, given India's push for the 5G technology to be safe and secure.The San Diego-based company creates semiconductors, software, and services related to wireless technology. A world leader in 3G, 4G, and next-generation wireless technology innovations for more than 30 years, Qualcomm is now pioneering its way to 5G with a new era of intelligent products that are revolutionising industries, including automotive, computing, and IoT.India is looking for a major investment from Qualcomm. As India is taking gigantic steps in the use of solar power to meet its energy needs, the meeting with Mark Widmar is important as First Solar is a leading global provider of comprehensive photovoltaic (“PV”) solar solutions, which use its advanced module and system technology. Early this summer, the Arizona-based company announced to add 3.3 GW of capacity in a new facility in India at an estimated cost of USD684 million. Stephen A Schwarzman is Chairman, CEO and Co-Founder of Blackstone, one of the world's leading investment firms investing capital on behalf of pension funds, large institutions and individuals.In March this year, Blackstone announced that funds managed by Blackstone Real Estate have acquired Embassy Industrial Parks from Warburg Pincus and Embassy Group, in one of India's largest logistics transactions.

The world expects a broad-based inclusive process that involves representation from all sections of Afghan society," Jaishankar said while addressing the meeting on the sidelines of the 76th session of the General Assembly here.He said that international community must come together in response to humanitarian needs. “Assistance providers must be accorded unimpeded, unrestricted and direct access,” he said."UNSC resolution 2593, which reflects global sentiment, should continue to guide our approach.

The couple — Govindaraju Durga Purna Vaishali and her husband Machavaram Sudhakar — are being interrogated as regards to “bigger players” behind the smuggling of such a huge consignment.The drug haul is considered to be one of the biggest in the world with the value of the seized heroin estimated to be around Rs 21,000 crore in the international markets.“Eight persons — four Afghan nationals, one Uzbek and three Indians — have been arrested. The arrested Indian nationals include the holder of the import export code (IEC) that was used to import the consignment. He was arrested from Chennai. Investigations are in progress,” read the statement issued by the Press Information Bureau.The security and enforcement agencies investigating the case have said the incident has once again fuelled concerns that the sea route is being increasingly used by traffickers for smuggling.The menace is expected to grow further in view of the fact that the Taliban has taken over the reins of power in Afghanistan.An official dealing with narco-terrorism said they had information that Vaishali and Sudhakar were taking instructions from some persons based in Afghanistan and Iran. “Their role in drug smuggling in the garb of imports is also being investigated, but they appear to be small players as their commission is very low,” officials said.

Hindus, mainly those associated with the Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, are in deep shock and may express their anger during the polling,” says Panwar, who is also associated with the Samajwadi Party, BJP’s main rival in UP.However, Lucknow-based political observer K Vikram Rao says the attempt to politically exploit the Mahant’s death “is not possible because he had followers/connections in almost all political parties”.“Almost every politician used to visit him and seek his blessings, although the situation may become clear after his suicide note is made public,” says Rao. Broadly, what he means is that a lot will depend on what parties say if “allegations in the suicide note are proven right”.For now, as a Prayagraj-based professor says, “The Mahant’s dispute with his disciple (Anand) was a widely publicised matter for long.”Question mark on law and order||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mahant-narendra-giris-death-case-may-impact-up-poll-say-experts-314920

The PM 2.5 norms for 24 hours average is now 15 µg/m3 instead of 25 µg/m3 (in 2005) and 5 µg/m3 annual instead of 10 µg/m3 (in 2005).Even at the current relaxed standard, at 40 ug/m3 for annual PM 2.5 averages in India versus WHO’s 2005 annual limit of 10 ug/m3, most Indian cities fail to meet even those levels, says Prof SN Tripathi, Steering Committee Member, National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), calling for revising India’s air quality standards to make them more stringent.According to Prof Tripathi, there is scientific evidence to prove that air pollution is leading to severe health impacts and 90 per cent of the entire global population is breathing polluted air.Dr Ravindra Khaiwal of the Environment Health Department, PGI, Chandigarh, says the stringent standards will bring the focus on strict and swift action for better air quality. “Meeting the new guidelines seems a challenge, but under NCAP, India is committed to minimise 20-30 per cent of cities’ air pollution,” he said.Bio-decomposer to check stubble-burning||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-revises-air-quality-norms-experts-wary-314885

The top court had on June 30 directed the NDMA to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to the kin of those who died due to Covid, saying the authority was statutorily mandated to provide minimum relief, including ex-gratia to the victims of the pandemic.Holding that by not providing an ex-gratia amount the NDMA had failed in discharging its statutory duty, a Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan had directed the NDMA to determine in six weeks the ex-gratia amount to be paid to the family of each Covid victim.However, it had said it won’t be proper for the court to direct a particular amount to be paid. On September 3, it had expressed displeasure over delay in framing guidelines for issuance of death certificates to the families of victims.The order had come on PILs seeking an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh each to the kin of the deceased. The Centre had opposed it, contending that giving an ex-gratia amount of Rs 4 lakh each to kin of Covid victims wasn’t possible due to limited resources as it would affect pandemic response on other aspects, leading to more damage than good.WHO hails India’s Covax moveThank you Health Minister @mansukhmandviya for announcing #India will resume crucial #COVID19 vaccine shipments to #COVAX in October (sic).

She said a study group had been set up to make recommendations in this regard.The Bench, however, said the examination had already been scheduled and interim orders passed. “The armed forces are best suited to deal with emergencies...

Don’t ask us to effectively vacate the order. You go on with the exercise. Let’s see the result and see how many women get there,” the Bench said.As Bhati said “we will be in a tight situation”, the Bench shot back: “The armed forces of the country have been in far greater situations than a tight situation such as this one. It would be difficult for us to accept the submissions of the Centre in view of the aspirations of the candidates willing to take the exam... The armed forces have seen far more emergent situations both at the border and in the country.

The London-based MCC believes that the use of gender-neutral terminology would help reinforce cricket’s status as an inclusive game for all.The MCC said in a statement that at time of the last redraft of the laws two years ago, it was agreed, after consultations with the International Cricket Council (ICC), that the terminology would remain as “batsman” and “batsmen”. However, the MCC noted today that the changes reflect the wider usage of the terms “batter” and “batters” in cricketing circles since then. “The move to ‘batter’ is a natural progression, aligning with the terms of bowlers and fielders that already fits within the laws,” an MCC statement added.Before today’s announcement, news outlets have been using terms such as batsman, batswoman and batter for female cricketers. However, female cricketers have been referring to themselves as batters for a long time, and now MCC wants men’s game to use batter rather than batsman.IPL player Natarajan tests +veDubai: Sunrisers Hyderabad pacer T Natarajan has tested positive for Covid, but the team’s IPL match against Delhi Capitals on Wednesday went ahead as scheduled.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-rule-batsman-out-gender-neutral-batter-in-314880

His one-on-one with US President Joe Biden too was becoming difficult to schedule due to shifting pandemic lockdowns.With India worried over the overspill of radicalism and extremism from Afghanistan, the regional situation will form the crux of PM Modi’s discussions with Biden and at the Quad summit though the existential threat posed by China will remain an important point of the talks.Doval, Shringla accompany PMThe PM is being accompanied by NSA Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and other high officialsTaking place after the AUKUS security arrangement was announced, the in-person format would help India seek answers on the Quad’s place in the US security architecture for the Indo-Pacific.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has already held a dozen bilateral meetings with his counterparts with Afghanistan being an important item, including the all-important issue of who will represent the country at the UN. Unlike the takeover of Kabul that blindsided most countries, there is time for consensus on the issue since the UN will take time to decide on the Taliban’s application for membership, US officials have said.While PM Modi left for the US on Wednesday, Jaishankar participated in a G-20 Foreign Ministers’ meeting and held a joint interaction with his P-4 counterparts from Germany, Japan and Brazil to push for permanent seats in the UNSC.The PM’s engagements in Washington also include his first meeting with US Vice-president Kamala Harris and a focused interaction with select CEOs of US MNCs, including Adobe, Apple, Blackstone and Qualcomm, unlike in 2019 when he addressed over 60 CEOs in three roundtables.Modi will meet PMs Yoshihide Suga and Scott Morrison on Friday besides having an interaction with Biden on the current regional security situation. The US and India are on the same page in insisting the Taliban adhere to UNSC Resolution 2593 on the secure departure of civilians from Afghanistan, upholding human rights and going for an inclusive and negotiated settlement.After concluding his engagements in Washington, Modi will travel to New York to attend the UN General Assembly on Saturday where he will address the general debate of the high-level segment of the 76th Session in the evening.Modi’s last visit to the US was for over a week in 2019 during which he addressed the “Howdy Modi” event in Houston with then US President Donald Trump.The PM is being accompanied by NSA Ajit Doval, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and other high officials.Modi’s aircraft flies over Pak airspacePM Modi’s special flight to the US flew over Pakistan’s airspace to avoid Afghanistan.

23-09-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi bats for mutual recognition of vaccine certificates amid UK row||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday batted for international travel to be made easier through mutual recognition of Covid vaccine certificates by countries.The remarks made at the Global Covid 19 Summit at the start of PM’s US visit come at a time when the UK travel rules continue to cite problems with India’s Covid vaccine certifications while granting approval to indigenously made Covishield.“We need to focus on addressing the pandemic’s economic effects. To that end, international travel should be made easier, through mutual recognition of vaccine certificates,” said the PM at the Summit, where he promised resumption of vaccine exports and called for supply chains of vaccine raw materials to be kept open.Terming Covid an unprecedented disruption which was not yet over, the PM said India had always seen humanity as one family.“Much of the world is still to be vaccinated. India has always seen humanity as one family. India’s pharmaceutical sector has produced cost effective diagnostics, drugs, medical devices and PPE kits. These are providing affordable options to many developed countries and we have shared medicines and supplies with over 150 countries,” said PM Modi.Noting that earlier this year India shared vaccine production with 95 other countries and UN Peace Keepers, the PM thanked the world for standing by the country through the second wave and said, “India is running the world’s largest vaccination campaign. Recently India vaccinated 25 million on a single day and in all over 800 million doses have been delivered so far. Over 200 million have been fully vaccinated.”Hailing CoWIN, India’s digital Covid vaccine delivery and certification platform, the PM said India had made digital solutions available to the world for free.“As our production increases we will be able to resume vaccine supplies to others too. For this, supply chains of raw materials must be kept open. With our Quad partners we are leveraging our vaccine making strength for the Indo Pacific,” the PM said.He recalled India and South Africa’s proposal for a TRIPS waiver at the WTO for Covid vaccines, diagnostics and medicines.“This will enable rapid scaling of the fight against the pandemic,” the PM said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-bats-for-mutual-recognition-of-vaccine-certificates-amid-uk-row-314770
