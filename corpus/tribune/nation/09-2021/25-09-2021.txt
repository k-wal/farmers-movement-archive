They were arrested on September 14 and 16 for allegedly passing on vital information to a Pakistani spy in lieu of money.Additional Director General of Police (ADGP), Crime Branch, Sanjeeb Panda said the woman, who falsely claimed that she was from Balasore, spoke to the five accused, unbeknown to each other, using a United Kingdom-based SIM card and stayed connected with them using seven Facebook accounts under different names, besides WhatsApp.“She frequently video-called two of the accused, and even gave marriage proposals to them. The woman, who is yet to be identified, had also extended an invitation to one of them come to ‘her residence’ in Chandipur,” he said on the alleged honey-trap angle to the espionage case.The senior police officer said that the Crime Branch was further inquiring the details of the UK phone number and the bank account in Dubai, from where one of the accused had received a cash transfer of around Rs 38,000 in two installments.“We are also probing the possibility of the accused getting money from other sources. Things would become clear after the woman’s identity is ascertained,” the ADG said.India test-fires its rockets, missiles and other air-borne weapon systems from ITR, a facility of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in Chandipur.Meanwhile, a team of Indian Air Force officials from West Bengal also interrogated the accused during their remand period in Cuttack. Earlier, a team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had also reached Balasore and discussed the matter with some security personnel at ITR, but refrained from questioning the accused.

The court is a place where people are in the shelter of law but they fall victim in courts of unlawful activities,” he said.The issue of safety and security of court complexes and judicial officers is already under the consideration of the top court which is likely to take it up on a priority basis next week.CJI NV Ramana had on Friday expressed deep concern at the Rohini Court Complex shootout. He had spoken to the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court in this regard and advised him to talk to both the police and the Bar to ensure that the functioning of court was not affected.Tiwari demanded that hardcore criminals be produced through video conferencing before the trial courts from jails, instead of producing them physically in the courts.He urged the top court to direct states to open armed police posts in District Court Complexes as also at the taluka level judiciary.Security and CCTV Cameras should be installed in the District Court complexes of our country, so that every incident may be caught in its true Scene and occurrence, he demanded.”In the rural areas and District Courts many litigants come with their aides in large numbers in order to pressurize the other side. Such unwanted mob or persons shall not be permitted with any litigant in the Court premises,” Tiwari submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rohini-court-shootout-advocate-moves-sc-for-protection-of-judges-lawyers-316109

This angered Owaisi. He went inside the car and left”. He added that if anybody within the party did this due to factionalism, he would be shown the door because the name of the party consists of the word ‘Ittehad’ which means unity.Nafees Ahmed, another office-bearer, said this is very sad for the party and some party men are responsible for it.He added that the party office bearers did not take any help from the police and district administration.“If the help from police had been sought, such an incident would not have happened,” he added.Nafees also said some party workers became over-enthusiastic, and they could not be controlled. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-owaisi-left-bhadohi-in-a-huff-316107

I want to inform UNGA that India has developed the world’s first DNA vaccine, which can be administered to all people above the age of 12 years,” Modi said, addressing the 76th United Nations General Assembly session here.Last month, the Drugs Controller General of India gave Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) to Zydus Cadila’s indigenously developed needle-free Covid-19 vaccine, ZyCoV-D, which is to be administered to beneficiaries in the age group of 12-18 years in the country.“Another mRNA vaccine is in its late stages of development. Scientists in India are also engaged in the development of a nasal vaccine for Corona. Realising its responsibility towards humanity, India has once again started giving vaccines to the needy of the world. I also invite vaccine manufacturers from all over the world today to- Come, Make Vaccine in India,” the prime minister said.ZyCoV-D when injected produces the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and elicits an immune response, which plays a vital role in protection from coronavirus as well as viral clearance.The “plug-and-play” technology on which the plasmid DNA platform is based can be easily adapted to deal with mutations in the virus, such as those already occurring.The vaccine has a 66-per cent efficacy and it is to be stored in a temperature range of two to eight degrees Celsius.The vaccine is needle-free, to be administered intradermally in three doses at days 0, 28 and 56. It is administered using PharmaJet, an applicator that ensures painless intradermal vaccine delivery.According to Johns Hopkins university data, the deadly virus has so far infected 231,154,501 people and killed 4,737,927 globally.

25-09-2021||Kolkata||Mamata accuses Centre of not allowing her to go to Rome peace meet out of ‘jealousy’||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday said the Centre had disallowed her attendance at a global peace meet in Rome, where she was the only invitee from the country, “out of jealousy”.The ministry of external affairs in a one-line communique, which reached the secretariat during the day said the “event is not commensurate for (attendance at) the level of the chief minister”, a secretariat official said.The Trinamool Congress supremo said at an election meeting at Bhabanipur where she is contesting by-polls to be held on September 30, that she had been invited to Rome in the first week of October to attend a global peace meeting in which the Pope, other religious heads, dignitaries from various countries are slated to attend, where she would have been the only Indian and “only Hindu lady.”  However, she claimed a “jealous BJP did not allow that, which only lowered the esteem for India in the outside world”.Banerjee contrasted her trip’s disallowance by the central government with Prime Minister Narendra Modi going ahead with his trip to the US “with special permission”, despite the World Health Organisation not approving Covaxin, with which the PM had been vaccinated.She also hit out at the BJP government for the death of two protestors in police firing during an eviction drive against settlers allegedly on government in Darra ng.“There was inhuman torture in Assam in the name of eviction. There was firing and bloodshed of innocent people but no NHRC team visited that state. NHRC teams visits only Bengal frequently. It is a matter of shame,” she said.Alleging that “goonda Raj” prevails in BJP-ruled Assam, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh, Banerjee said TMC delegations are prevented, harassed and come under attack in those states.“We don’t say anything about BJP leaders who keep visiting and peddling falsehood in West Bengal as free movement is everyone’s democratic right,” she said.Banerjee flagged the floating of bodies of alleged Covid-19 victims in the Ganges as a failure of the UP government and pointed to selective deletion of names of tens of lakhs of people in the exercise to create a National Register of Citizens in Assam.“It (deletion of names in the final NRC) shows the anti-people nature of BJP. In contrast we have already said there will be no NRC in Bengal,” the TMC supremo said.She also accused the opposition BJP of fomenting trouble in Bhabanipur, where she is a candidate in the by-poll.“BJP only carries on ‘goondagiri’ (violent or thuggish behaviour), peddles false propaganda. Please foil their game plan,” Banerjee said.Listing the achievements of the TMC government, the chief minister claimed that Bengal occupies number one position in respect of vaccination against COVID-19 and in the education sector.The TMC supremo said no processions are being taken out by her party in the campaigning in Bhabanipur as directed by the Election Commission in an oblique hint that the BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal is not adhering to the norms.She also criticised the spike in fuel prices and sale of PSUs and urged the people to defeat the “anti-people and pro-rich BJP”.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-accuses-centre-of-not-allowing-her-to-go-to-rome-peace-meet-out-of-jealousy-316100

You can’t pollute the entire atmosphere,” she said.“It is very important for our country to make sure the rule of law is strengthened because people who are coming out of their comfort zone to say something should get protection. That is why at times celebrities at times don’t come forward,” she said.Actress Nandita Das said there are so many unsung heroes who are not well known but the impact they have is much more than those in public space.“Whatever influence we have, we should use it for the betterment of others. We should expand the definition of celebrity to include those who are doing something truly to be celebrated.“Art is a reflection of reality and truth. There have been films made that make us think with their social message. Cinema is a means of entertainment but also a means of engagement,” she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/those-who-dissent-should-get-protection-shabana-azmi-316086
25-09-2021||United Nations||Sneha Dubey: Meet young diplomat who gave a blistering retort to Imran Khan in UN||First Secretary Sneha Dubey gave a blistering retort to Prime Minister Imran Khan in the UN General Assembly after he raked up the Kashmir issue in his address to the high-level session, continuing with a tradition of India’s young diplomats taking on Pakistani leaders at the annual event.Dubey, a 2012-batch IFS officer, has an MA and MPhil from Jawaharlal Nehru University and was Under Secretary (T) Latin America and Caribbean in the Ministry of External Affairs from December 2013 to August 2014. She was then Third Secretary in the Embassy of India in Madrid, according to her LinkedIn profile.Dubey delivered India’s strong Right of Reply on Friday from the UNGA hall, carrying on with a tradition seen over the past few years of young Indian diplomats taking on Pakistani leaders and strongly responding to their rants over Jammu and Kashmir and other internal matters of India.“We exercise our Right of Reply to one more attempt by the leader of Pakistan to tarnish the image of this august Forum by bringing in matters internal to my country, and going so far as to spew falsehoods on the world stage,” Dubey said in the UN General Assembly.“While such statements deserve our collective contempt and sympathy for the mindset of the person who utters falsehood repeatedly, I am taking the floor to set the record straight,” the young Indian diplomat said, slamming the 68-year-old cricketer-turned politician for raking up the Kashmir issue in his video address to the 76th session of the UN General Assembly.Dubey’s confident and sharp speech elicited congratulatory responses on social media sites.“Excellent rebuttal by this brilliant, young, energetic diplomat of this great nation,” a Twitter user said while another commented “A brave diplomat of India… Great job.” Another post on Twitter said, “A befitting reply by @SnehaDube Full of confidence and facts. Well done. Keep it up” while many others applauded India’s “Nari Shakti (women power)”.It was during the tenure of then Indian envoy at the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin that the trend began of India fielding young diplomats to deliver the Right of Reply to Pakistani leaders who consistently rake up the Kashmir issue and other internal matters of India in their addresses to the UN General Assembly and other forums of the world organisation. The message being that India’s young diplomats are enough to take on Pakistan’s leaders at the global forum.In September 2016, then First Secretary in the Indian Mission to the UN Eenam Gambhir delivered India’s Right of Reply to Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s UN General Assembly address.“The world has not yet forgotten that the trail of that dastardly attack led all the way to Abbottabad in Pakistan. The land of Taxila, one of the greatest learning centres of ancient times, is now host to the Ivy League of terrorism. It attracts aspirants and apprentices from all over the world. The effects of its toxic curriculum are felt across the globe.”A few days later, Gambhir had again delivered the Right of Reply when Islamabad’s then UN envoy Maleeha Lodhi had responded to late External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj’s address to the UN General Debate.Then again in 2017, it was Gambhir who took on then Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, saying in India’s Right of Reply that “In its short history, Pakistan has become a geography synonymous with terror. The quest for a land of pure has actually produced ‘the land of pure terror’. Pakistan is now Terroristan... Its current state can be gauged from the fact that Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, a leader of the United Nations designated terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Toiba, is now sought to be legitimised as a leader of a political party.” In 2019, another young Indian female diplomat Vidisha Maitra, First Secretary in India’s Permanent Mission to the UN, delivered the scathing Right of Reply from the UN General Assembly floor to Prime Minister “Imran Khan Niazi”.“Words matter in diplomacy. Invocation of phrases such as ‘pogrom’, ‘bloodbath’, ‘racial superiority’, ‘pick up the gun’ and ‘fight to the end’ reflect a medieval mindset and not a 21st century vision.”“Pogroms, Prime Minister Imran Khan Niazi, are not a phenomenon of today’s vibrant democracies,” Maitra had said.“We would request you to refresh your rather sketchy understanding of history. Do not forget the gruesome genocide perpetrated by Pakistan against its own people in 1971 and the role played by Lt. Gen A A K Niazi. A sordid fact that the Hon’ble Prime Minister of Bangladesh reminded this Assembly about earlier this afternoon.” In 2019, Khan had delivered his maiden speech at the UN General Debate and in his almost 50-minute address, devoted half of his time to India and Kashmir, drumming up hysteria over nuclear war.“Even coming from the leader of a country that has monopolized the entire value chain of the industry of terrorism, Prime Minister Khan’s justification of terrorism was brazen and incendiary,” Maitra had said.“Citizens of India do not need anyone else to speak on their behalf, least of all those who have built an industry of terrorism from the ideology of hate,” she said.Last year, First Secretary in the Permanent Mission of India to the UN Mijito Vinito, delivering India’s Right of Reply, had said that the “only crowning glory” that Pakistan has to show to the world for the last seven decades is terrorism, ethnic cleansing, majoritarian fundamentalism and clandestine nuclear trade. India’s scathing response slammed Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s “incessant rant” and “venom” in the UN General Assembly.“This august Forum witnessed today a new low on its 75th Anniversary. The leader of Pakistan today called for those who incite hate and violence to be outlawed. But, as he went on, we were left wondering, was he referring to himself?” Vinito had said.

25-09-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC allows medical termination of pregnancy at 22 weeks||The Delhi High Court has allowed a woman to medically terminate her 22-week pregnancy as a certain congenital anomaly was detected in the foetus, saying psychological harm is likely to be caused to her when the child is born.Justice Rekha Palli considered that the ultrasound report of the 31-year-old petitioner indicated that the child will suffer from various physical deformities and will require multiple corrective surgeries which will expose him to numerous intra-operative and post-operative complications, seriously affecting his quality of life.The judge was informed by the woman that in 2019, she had conceived twins. However, due to underlying complications, she delivered the children pre-maturely, with one child passing away due to physical deformities.The other child, the woman said, was still undergoing treatment and therefore, she was not in a mental state to endure the emotional trauma once again.“Since there is every likelihood that if the petitioner is not granted permission to terminate her pregnancy, grave psychological harm is likely to be caused to her, I am inclined to agree with the learned counsel for the petitioner that in the present case, the petitioner ought to be granted permission for termination of her pregnancy,” the court opined.The court stated that the medical board constituted in the present case did not disagree with the findings and observations made in the ultrasound report.It thus ordered that the petitioner, who was “conscious of the risks involved in the termination of her pregnancy at this stage”, be permitted to undergo the said procedure at a hospital of her choice.The foetus in the present case suffered from ‘nuchal edema & a bilateral cleft lip and palate’.

We are certain to defeat Team BJP," Rao added.In the 2017 Goa Assembly polls, the Congress had won the highest 17 seats in the 40-member House, restricting the BJP to 13. However, surprising the Congress, the saffron party had allied with regional parties and came to power.Over the years, Congress's strength in the Legislative Assembly dwindled to five after many of its MLAs switched sides and joined the ruling BJP.Gandhi's meeting with the party leaders took place amid indications that the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) may jump into the poll fray in the coastal state.

25-09-2021||---||Split Supreme Court: Former Home Secretary Madhav Godbole in book||New Delhi, September 24Abolition of Governor’s post, splitting the Supreme Court into constitutional and appellate courts and ensuring complete separation of religion from politics are some of the suggestions made by prominent intellectuals on Friday to rid the Indian polity of the malaise that afflict it.During an online discussion on former Home Secretary Madhav Godbole’s latest book ‘India-A Federal Union of States: Fault Lines, Challenges and Opportunities’, former Vice-President Hamid Ansari, former Jammu and Kashmir Governor NN Vohra, former Delhi High Court Chief Justice AP Shah, NALSAR University of Law (Hyderabad) Vice Chancellor Prof Faizan Mustafa and author Gurcharan Das discussed the problems confronting India’s federal polity and attempted to offer possible solutions. Expressing concern over mixing religion with politics, Godbole wanted the Representation of People’s Act to include a provision to debar those doing so.Making a radical suggestion, he said the post of Governor should be abolished and the SC split into constitutional and appellate courts with the former having nine judges to decide constitutional issues.NN Vohra, whose 1993 report as Home Secretary highlighted the problem of criminalisation of politics and the nexus between criminals, politicians and bureaucrats, raised the issue of rising number of tainted politicians entering Parliament and state Assemblies. He expressed concern over corruption and lack of accountability undermining the rule of the law.He said one of the institutions ringing the bell was the judiciary, but unfortunately questions were being raised not only about the subordinate and high courts but also the office of the CJI. He also spoke of the huge pendency of around 4 crore cases in courts.Emphasising the need for inner-party democracy, former Governor Vohra lamented that recommendations made by the Law Commission and the Election Commission had not been implemented. He expressed concern over politicisation of administration from the level of ‘patwari’ to the Chief Secretary.Ansari raised concern over ‘Islamophobia’ and alleged violation of civil rights in J&K after nullification of Article 370. Justice Shah alleged violation of human rights in J&K. Prof Mustafa took exception to Godbole terming the nullification of Article 370 as a “masterstroke” and advocated a system modelled on the US federalism. Author Gurcharan Das cautioned against the imposition of any language and demanded that English be given a place in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.The book discusses Centre-state relations, the dysfunctional Inter-State Council and GST and maintains that the future of India’s federalism would depend on the resolution of these issues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/split-supreme-court-former-home-secretary-madhav-godbole-in-book-315782

Known to forget names, Biden introduced PM Modi as “my friend from India” just as he had referred to Australian PM Scott Morrison as “my friend from Down Under” while announcing AUKUS security treaty a week ago. PM Modi noted that the four countries had come together for the first time in 2004 to extend support to the Indo-Pacific region that had been hit by tsunami.“Today, the world is grappling with the pandemic and we are meeting once again as Quad and working for humanity,” he said, observing that the Quad initiative to produce one billion vaccines in India would greatly help countries in the Indo-Pacific region.The Quad, he hoped, would move forward to find answers to wide-ranging issues such as supply chains, global security, climate action, Covid response and technology.Biden described Quad as a group of democratic partners, sharing the same world view and a common vision of the future, coming together to take on key challenges. “`We are making excellent progress,” he said while announcing fellowships for students from Quad countries to pursue advanced degrees in STEM and said the plan to manufacture one billion vaccines in India was on track.The four major democracies of the world, he declared, “know how to get things done and are up to the challenge”.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said a trusted and secure cyberspace and addressing supply chain problems should be Quad’s priorities. Its collective strength, he hoped, would lead to an Indo-Pacific where disputes were settled peacefully in accordance with international law.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga wanted Quad to discuss new areas, such as infrastructure and clean energy and promote people-to-people exchanges in science and technology.Quad highlights*PM was accorded due seniority, and he was asked to be the last to arrive and the first to leave.*The Quad Leaders’ Summit was structured around four themes – Afghanistan and Regional Security; Covid response; Tech and cyber security; and Climate.*PM was the lead speaker on the theme of tech and cyber security, and made important suggestions on taking forward cooperation.*Biological E will produce 1 million doses of Janssen vaccine by next month and India will finance 50% of first consignment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biden-quad-plan-to-make-1-bn-covid-vaccines-in-india-on-track-315781

Pilot is learnt to be keen on working in Rajasthan even though there are possibilities of the leadership asking him to handle an AICC responsibility. Importantly, Pilot was the only state Congress president who did not graduate to become CM after the party won an election. In MP, state chief Kamal Nath became CM and in Chhattisgarh, then state president Bhupesh Baghel was elevated.

"I firmly believe it would act as a force for global good," Modi said. He also said that the Quad vaccine initiative will help Indo-Pacific nations."When world is fighting Covid-19, we have, after the 2004 Tsunami in Japan, come together again for humanity  in the form of Quad alliance," he said.He said the Quad has decided to go ahead with a positive approach on the basis of the shared democratic values of the member states. "I'd be happy to discuss with my friends-be it supply chain, global security, climate action, COVID response or technology cooperation." Morrison said that the Indo-Pacific region should be free from coercion and disputes should be solved in accordance with international law."The Indo-Pacific has great challenges and challenges have to be overcome. In six months from the last meeting so much has been accomplished. We stand here together in the Info Pacific region," he said. "I hope we are able to hold a relevant summit," Japanese Prime Minister Suga said.During the summit, the four leaders are expected to discuss promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific, address the climate crisis and advance practical cooperation on areas like combatting COVID-19.Ahead of the summit, the White House said that the Quad leaders would announce a new working group on space, a supply chain initiative and a 5G deployment and diversification effort apart from discussing issues like challenges in the Indo Pacific, climate change and COVID-19 pandemic during their historic meeting.Quad leaders are also planning to roll out vaccine deliverables and announce a series of measures in the field of healthcare and infrastructure sector, officials said.India, the US and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China's rising military manoeuvring in the region.China claims nearly all of the disputed South China Sea, though Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam all claim parts of it. Beijing has built artificial islands and military installations in the South China Sea.Ahead of the Quad summit, Prime Minister Modi separately met his Australian and Japanese counterparts on Thursday and they reaffirmed the importance of maritime security towards the realisation of a "free and open" Indo-Pacific.

25-09-2021||---||'Abolish Governor’s post, split Supreme Court into constitutional and appellate courts’||New Delhi, September 24Abolition of Governor’s post, splitting the Supreme Court into constitutional and appellate courts and ensuring complete separation of religion from politics – these were some of the suggestions made by prominent intellectuals on Friday to rid the Indian polity of the malaise that afflict it.During an online discussion on former Home Secretary Madhav Godbole’s latest book ‘India-A Federal Union of States: Fault Lines, Challenges and Opportunities’, former Vice President Hamid Ansari, former Jammu and Kashmir Governor NN Vohra, former Delhi High Court Chief Justice AP Shah, NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad Vice Chancellor Prof Faizan Mustafa and author Gurcharan Das passionately discussed the problems confronting India’s federal polity and attempted to offer possible solutions.Outlining the fault lines, Godbole particularly expressed concern about mixing of religion and politics and hate speeches made by politicians. He wanted the Representation of People Act to include a provision to debar those mixing religion and politics.Making a radical suggestion, he said the post of Governor should be abolished and the Supreme Court should be split into Constitutional and appellate courts, with the former having nine judges sitting together to decide constitutional issues alone.Vohra—whose 1993 report as Home Secretary highlighted the problem of the criminalisation of politics and of the nexus between criminals, politicians and bureaucrats—raised the issue of criminalisation of politics and the rising number of tainted politicians in Parliament and state Assemblies. He expressed serious concern over corruption and lack of accountability undermining rule of law.One of the institutions, which was ringing the bell, was the judiciary but unfortunately questions were being raised not only about the subordinate and high courts…but also about an office as high as that of the CJI. He also raised the issue of huge pendency of around 400 million cases in courts.Emphasising the need for inner-party democracy, Vohra lamented that recommendations made by the Law Commission and Election Commission have not been implemented. He also expressed serious concern over the politicisation of administration from the level of ‘patwari’ to Chief Secretary.Ansari raised concern over Islamophobia and violation of civil rights in Jammu and Kashmir after the nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution, while Justice Shah raised the issue of violation of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir.Prof Mustafa raised certain questions on some of the ideas enunciated in the book. He particularly took exception to Godbole terming the nullification of Article 370 as a “masterstroke” and advocated a federal system modeled on the US federalism.Author Gurcharan Das cautioned against imposition of any language on a state and demanded that English should be given a place in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.The book analyses India’s journey as a federal polity with a multi-party democracy having its unique model in the last 70 years, with a greatly polarised polity.It discusses Centre-state relations, dysfunctional Inter-State Council and GST and maintains that the future of India’s federalism will depend on the resolution of these issues. It also raises questions about the capacity, resources and the will to deal with national security issues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abolish-governors-post-split-supreme-court-into-constitutional-and-appellate-courts-315662

In Madhya Pradesh, state chief Kamal Nath became CM and in Chhattisgarh, then state president Bhupesh Baghel was elevated. Earlier in Punjab, Capt Amarinder, then state chief, became the CM after the 2017 win.The rebel camp that made peace with the Congress and Gehlot now wants its due, sources said, with the Gandhi siblings emboldened following the exit of heavyweight Amarinder Singh in Punjab.Sources said a Cabinet reshuffle and a responsibility for Pilot were under active deliberation but the challenge is to keep Ashok Gehlot on the right side given his sway among the state MLAs unlike in Punjab, where the Gandhis, after an elaborate exercise, had sensed a growing disenchantment with Amarinder.Pilot is learnt to have made it clear to the party that he was expecting a role in Rajasthan and not in the AICC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-done-rahul-gandhi-and-priyanka-meet-sachin-pilot-to-fix-rajasthan-affairs-315646

The mention of East China Sea, the South China Sea and economic coercion by Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga in a meeting with Indian PM Narendra Modi on Thursday in Washington was termed by the Chinese MFA as “lying diplomacy’’ and “smearing diplomacy’’.Chinese MFA spokesperson Zhao Lijian called Washington as the “headquarters of the so-called economic coercion’’ and said China neither exercises “long-arm jurisdiction’’ nor “arbitrarily oppresses foreign companies’’.Asked about the Quad summit, he said the four countries should view China’s development in a “correct light’’ and do more to promote solidarity and cooperation among countries in the region.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/provocative-chinese-attitude-led-to-galwan-valley-clashes-mea-315635

25-09-2021||---||Incumbent on our nations to protect democracies: Kamala Harris||New Delhi, September 24As democracies around the world are under threat, “it is imperative that we defend democratic principles and institutions within our respective countries,” US Vice President Kamala Harris has told Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their 15-minute meeting at the White House on Thursday."And that we maintain what we must do to strengthen democracies at home and it is incumbent on our nations to of course protect democracies in the best interests of people of our countries,” she said in her remarks as she welcomed Modi to her ceremonial office.Both leaders had warm words on cooperation during the pandemic. Modi thanked Harris for offering a “sense of kinship” in a phone call during India’s deadly second wave in April-May. Harris reciprocated by calling India a vital source of vaccines for other countries early in the pandemic and welcomed India’s announcement to soon resume vaccine exports.Harris, whose mother was born in India, is the first US Vice President of Indian descent. She is also the first woman and first black person to hold the office.Modi invited Harris to visit India, telling her that Indians “are waiting to welcome you” and calling her “the source of inspiration for so many people across the world”.“I am completely confident that under President Biden and your leadership, our bilateral relationship will reach new heights,” he said.Also read: Modi, Japanese PM reaffirm commitment for free, open Indo-Pacific ahead of Quad meetingTop American CEOs appreciate recent reform measures in India, Shringla says after they meet ModiLater, when asked about Harris’ comments on democracy, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told the media that the Vice President appreciated the fact that both the countries represented large and successful democracies and that “we needed to continue to work not only within our own countries, but with other countries, to promote the brand of democracy.”                “In the discussions, I think she did mention that the US Congress was highly appreciative and kept noting the fact that India and the US represented the two largest democracies. There was a great deal of appreciation of how both our democracies function. And that was I would say discussion that took place in the actual meeting, which, in which the media were not present,” Shringla told the media in response to a question.Quad spy chiefs in townCall it a coincidence but national security or spy chiefs of all four nations are in the US on the eve of the Summit of their leaders at the White House. The presence of DG of Australia’s Office of National Intelligence Andrew Shearer, India’s NSA Ajit Doval, CIA chief Bill Burns and Japanese Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office chief Hiroaki Takizawa suggests that the primacy of the Quad as a security grouping will remain though US officials have sought to give it an economic orientation during their briefings. — with PTI inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/incumbent-on-our-nations-to-protect-democracies-kamala-harris-315586

25-09-2021||London||UK MPs debate Kashmir motion; India condemns 'abusive' language||Members of Parliament from the UK’s All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Kashmir have tabled a motion on ‘Human rights in Kashmir’ for a debate in the House of Commons, drawing a strong reaction from India which said any assertion made in any forum on a subject related to an integral part of the country needs to be duly substantiated with authentic verifiable facts.Also read: Turkish President Erdogan again makes reference to Kashmir in UN General Assembly addressThe Minister for Asia in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), Amanda Milling, responded to the debate on Thursday by reiterating the UK government's unchanged stance on Kashmir as a bilateral issue.“The government takes the situation in Kashmir very seriously but it's for India and Pakistan to find a lasting political solution, taking into account the wishes of the Kashmiri people. It's not for the UK to prescribe a solution or to act as a mediator,” said Milling.The Indian government expressed its dismay at some of the language used by participating MPs in the Backbench Debate, specifically Pakistani-origin Labour MP Naz Shah.A minister from the Indian High Commission in London condemned the attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and highlighted Kashmir's status as an integral part of India.“It is with sadness that the High Commission of India notes that an august institution of a fellow democracy has been misused today to level abuse against the elected leader of the largest practising democracy in the world,” the minister said, referring to Shah's remarks on the 2002 Gujarat riots.“As on previous occasions, the High Commission of India reiterates that any assertion made in any forum on a subject related to an integral part of India needs to be duly substantiated with authentic verifiable facts,” the minister added.The debate, which was scheduled to be held in March 2020 but had to be postponed due to the Covid pandemic lockdown, was opened by Opposition Labour Party MP Debbie Abrahams who recounted her visit to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in February 2020.“The Pakistani government allowed us unfettered access…we used our meetings to ask pointed questions related to human rights issues highlighted in United Nations reports,” said Abrahams.“Kashmiris must be at the heart of a trilateral peacebuilding process,” she said, reiterating that Thursday's debate was not “pro or anti” any country and only speaking in favour of human rights.Over 20 cross-party MPs participated on both sides of the debate, with Labour MP Barry Gardiner highlighting the terrorist camps harboured by Pakistan in the region and drawing parallels with neighbouring Afghanistan."Over the years Pakistan has harboured Taliban leaders and the ISI, their security services, provided other forms of support to them and to other terrorist organisations," he said.Conservative Party MPs Bob Blackman and Theresa Villiers spoke about India's democratic credentials and flagged the completion of local elections in Kashmir last December despite pandemic-related adversities.“As a democracy where religious minorities have full constitutional protections and which places great value on the respect for the rule of law, I believe that India's courts and institutions are well capable of properly investigating alleged human rights abuses,” said Villiers.
