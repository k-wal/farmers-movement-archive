You are good members. Please cooperate with the Chair”.However, as the din refused to die down, the speaker adjourned the House till 12.45 pm and then till 2 pm.The BJP workers began their protests before the House assembled for the day. They staged demonstrations outside the House with traditional musical instruments jhal and majeera. They sat on the stairs at the entrance of the Assembly chanting ‘Hare Rama’ and ‘Jai Shriram’ and waved placards.They demanded the recall of the order on the allotment of the namaz room.The BJP workers on Sunday had burnt the effigies of Chief Minister Hemant Soren and the speaker during protests across the state against the decision on the Namaz room in the Assembly.Mahato has allotted room number TW 348 of the Assembly for offering namaz, prompting BJP to demand a Hanuman temple and places of worship of other religions in the assembly premises. The government must immediately revoke the “unconstitutional and undemocratic decision” on the Namaz room, the saffron party said and took to the streets.Talking to the media outside the Assembly, Soren described the opposition action in the House as “unfortunate”.“They (opposition) had come prepared to obstruct the House proceedings. Such action will only affect the development of the state,” he said.A notification dated September 2 and signed by Jharkhand Legislative Assembly Deputy Secretary Naveen Kumar by order of the speaker said, “Allotment of room number TW 348 as Namaz Hall for offering Namaz in the new Assembly Building.” The ruling Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and ally Congress welcomed it.As soon as the notification came to the fore on Saturday, former Jharkhand chief minister and BJP national vice-president Raghubar Das hit out at them.“MLAs in the Hemant Soren government openly support the Taliban. A separate Namaz Hall in the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly is a result of this ideology. Otherwise, any person who believes in Indian democracy would not do such an act.” BJP chief whip Biranchi Narayan has written a letter to the speaker warning of approaching the court if the decision is not revoked.Congress MLA Irfan Ansari, who courted controversy by allegedly supporting Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, said that the BJP creates religious conflicts over every issue.The monsoon session will continue till September 9.The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), the main opposition party in the 81-member Jharkhand Assembly, had created an uproar on Friday, the first day of the monsoon session, demanding to know under what circumstances its legislature party leader Babulal Marandi has not yet been accorded the status of Leader of the Opposition.The Assembly session will continue till September 9.

06-09-2021||New Delhi||Rahul voices support for protesting farmers, BJP hits back||A day after thousands of farmers gathered at a mahapanchayat in Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday voiced support for the protesting farmers and said they are fearless and standing resolutely.The BJP attacked Gandhi and alleged that he was trying to fuel propaganda by tweeting an old picture “to claim success of the mahapanchayat”.“Standing resolutely and fearless, here are the ‘Bharat Bhagya Vidhata’,” Gandhi tweeted in Hindi along with a photograph of a massive public gathering.Gandhi used the hashtag of ‘FarmersProtest’ along with his tweet.Attacking Gandhi, the BJP’s Information and Technology Department head Amit Malviya tweeted, “That Rahul Gandhi has to use an old picture to claim success of the Mahapanchayat just shows how the propaganda to call it a well attended ‘farmer’ agitation hasn’t worked.”               डटा हैनिडर हैइधर है भारत भाग्य विधाता! #FarmersProtest pic.twitter.com/hnaTQV0GbU  “It is political. With religious slogans raised, it leaves no one in doubt, what the actual motivation is!” he said.Slamming Malviya, Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Jayant Chaudhary said the photograph tagged by Gandhi was from a kisan panchayat organised by his party in Shamli and asked what the BJP leader wanted to say.Thousands of farmers from Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring states on Sunday gathered in Muzaffarnagar for the ‘kisan mahapanchayat’ and vowed to continue their stir till the three contentious agri laws enacted by the Centre are scrapped.The event was organised by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) which has been spearheading the agitation against the laws since November last year.The farmers’ protest at Delhi’s borders against the three contentious laws has been going on for over nine months.They have been demanding the repeal of the laws which they feel will do away with the MSP system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.The government has insisted that these laws have given farmers a new opportunity to sell their produce and rejected claims that they are aimed at doing away with the minimum support price regime and farm mandis.

But the manner in which such identification can be made online is a concern for us.” The bench said that two modes have been suggested during the hearing and one of them was to be physically present before the Consulate, if the couple was residing abroad, or before the authority recognised under the domestic law.“The second mode is developing a technology tool for identifying the parties with reference to facial recognition or with bio metrical credentials,” it said.The state, meanwhile, was not in favour of online solemnisation of marriages under the Act.It had contended before the single judge that solemnisation of marriage was mandatory prior to registering it under the SMA and therefore, presence of the two sides and the witnesses is required before the Marriage Officer.It has further contended that another requirement for solemnisation of the marriage was that at least one of the two parties has to be a resident of the area within the territorial limits of the Marriage Officer for minimum 30 days prior to issuing the notice of the intended nuptials.Therefore, two persons living abroad cannot have their marriage solemnised online if they do not satisfy the residence requirement, it had argued.

06-09-2021||Nagpur||Javed Akhtar’s Taliban-RSS remarks aimed at creating confusion in society: VHP; seeks action||The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Monday condemned the statement of Javed Akhtar on the Taliban and RSS calling it a “conspiracy” to confuse society and demanded strict action against the Bollywood lyricist.“The Taliban is a terrorist organisation which believes in violence and is anti-women. Comparing such organisations with the RSS, VHP and Bajrang Dal.....I condemn his statement. All these three organisations do not believe in violence and do not work against anyone. They do social service. It seems like a conspiracy when such big people give such statements and society gets confused. His statement was aimed at confusing society by telling lies. Strict action should be taken against him,” VHP national general secretary Milind Parande told reporters when asked about Akhtar’s statement.Parande demanded that the web series “Empire” be restricted as it is “very systematically channelising the violent and aggressive Muslim invaders”.To a query on Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat’s meeting with some Muslim intellectuals in Mumbai, Parande said, “organisations that work in society for the national cause can meet anybody. This meeting is part of that normal discourse”.Queried on VHP’s stand in the next year’s assembly polls in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, Parande said the VHP is not a political party.“The VHP works in the interest of Hindus. We believe that the interest of Hindus and the country is the same. We would like to have the Central and state governments that think of the interest of Hindus. We will spread awareness in society about the Hindu interest and the importance of voting,” he said.Parande termed as “appeasement policy” the allotment of a room for offering namaz in the Jharkhand Assembly.“This appeasement is going on even now. India was divided due to such an appeasement policy. Any dialogue with Muslims or anyone should be on the principles of nationalism as they are citizens of this country. The dialogue should not be based on appeasement as it is not good for the country. What happened in Jharkhand is an example of appeasement,” he said.Parande also demanded action against the persons involved in the Hijab incident in Nagpur.A complaint was filed at a police station on Saturday after some local residents took exception to the alleged distribution of pamphlets advocating ‘hijab” (Islamic head covering) in the Civil Lines area. Some morning walkers saw three women allegedly distributing pamphlets and urging young women to wear the hijab, and questioned them, a police release had said.Parande refused to speak on the agenda of recently held coordination meetings held between the RSS and its affiliated organisations like VHP, BMS and others in Nagpur.

There are huge crowds in hospitals, and children are dying due to a lack of proper and timely treatment, he said in a party statement.The BJP government is, however, not paying attention to the collapsed health services in the state, he added.Dengue fever has claimed the lives of hundreds of innocents in western Uttar Pradesh, and the outbreak is now visible in the eastern part of the state as well, Yadav alleged.In state capital Lucknow itself, there is a rush in hospitals, he said, adding that the disease has hit Firozabad, Mathura, Mainpuri, Kanpur and Farrukhabad among other places badly.The cries of mothers who have lost their children is a reality which is far away from the tall claims being made in government advertisements, the SP chief said.Citing various cases of hardships being faced by family members of patients in getting medical attention, Yadav alleged that the BJP government lacked sensitivity, and said dengue has exposed the reality of its claims of having improved medical facilities.There is widespread public anger against the BJP as it has shown disregard towards the health and the welfare of the people, he said.The BJP will never come back to power again, and everyone is confident that a ‘Samajwadi’ government will be formed in 2022, Yadav added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/children-dying-of-dengue-viral-fever-but-adityanath-claiming-all-is-well-akhilesh-307550

She was then taken to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, officials said.Officials said police have booked drivers of both trucks on the basis of a complaint of a victim, Constable Ram Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-cops-among-four-wounded-after-two-cash-trucks-ram-into-each-other-on-madhya-marg-307546

06-09-2021||---||Will focus on dealing with pandemic here than to delve in conspiracy theories: SC||New Delhi, September 6The Supreme Court Monday said there are many articles and a lot of literature in the open on the origin of Covid-19 Delta variant and it would rather focus on dealing with the pandemic than delve into conspiracy theories.The top court made this observation while refusing to entertain a petition seeking direction to Centre to set up an international task force, composed of national and international experts (including those from China) in consultation with this court, for finding scientific answers about the Delta variant’s origin and the extent to which it was responsible for the second wave of Covid-19.A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli said the petitioner NGO ‘Abhinav Bharat Congress’ and its president Pankaj K Phadnis should approach the government for the constitution of the international task force.“You should approach the government with your prayer and make a representation. We don’t have jurisdiction over citizens of China or for that matter citizens of the USA. If they want to constitute a task force to find out the origin they can do so, we cannot do,” the bench said.Phadnis said the origin of the Delta variant of Covid-19 is still a mystery and some experts have said that it originated in Amravati, Maharashtra, while other experts have said different things.He said that from April to June 2021, more than 2,50,000 Indians—by official count, while credible reports put this number higher by a factor of 15 -- have lost their lives due to Covid-19.“We know there are a lot of articles and literature in the open with regard to the Delta variant of Covid-19 but we would like to focus on dealing with the pandemic here rather than to devolve into conspiracy theories,” the bench said.Phadnis, appearing in-person, said the court may record in the order that the government may consider his representation.“No, we will not say any such thing in the order. You can always go to the government. They are there for the citizens of the country,” the bench said, while disposing of the petition.Phadnis has said in the plea that during the second wave of Covid-19, there were many days when more than 4,00,000 cases and thousands of deaths were recorded.“Even today more than 40,000 cases are being recorded with hundreds of deaths per day. Grim images of wailing relatives of patients, ever burning pyres and dead bodies floating in the river have come to forever sear the consciousness of any sane person,” the plea said.It said that Indians are presently barred from entry in most countries across the world including UK and USA, where many Indians live causing untold misery to their near and dear ones in India.“There is no proper knowledge in the public domain with respect to what precisely caused this massive continuing tragedy. Lack of Covid appropriate behaviour, large religious festivals, assembly elections, lackadaisical approach of Centre to procure vaccines have been cited as reasons,” the plea said.However, there is yet no all India scientific data to prove that the so-called second wave of the pandemic that caused death and devastation in India was dominated by this Delta variant of Covid-19, it said.

We want an inclusive government. We want that the Afghan soil should not be a source of terror for other countries in the region," Kudashev said."These are the very basic values that bring Russia and India together. I do not see much of a difference in our position on Afghanistan," he said.Asked whether Russia is concerned about the possible export of terrorism to Russia from Afghanistan, the envoy said "definitely" and noted that any escalation of the civilian conflict would be detrimental to the regional security scenario."As far as the phenomena of terror are concerned, we do share our concerns with India. There is a danger of terror being spread to the Russian territory and the territory of Kashmir. This is a matter of common concern," Kudashev said, replying to a question on the possibility of various terror groups operating from Afghanistan shifting focus from the war-ravaged country.Asked about Pakistan backing various terror groups operating in Afghanistan and whether they pose a threat to regional security, Kudashev said Russia expects Pakistan to be among the countries that would like to see predictability and a secure environment in Afghanistan.There have been mounting concerns in India over the possibility of a rise in activities of various terror groups, including Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.Indian Ambassador to Qatar Deepak Mittal met senior Taliban leader Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai in Doha last Tuesday.In the meeting, Mittal conveyed to Stanekzai that Afghanistan's soil should not be used for anti-Indian activities and terrorism. It was the first publicly acknowledged formal engagement between the two sides.Kudashev said tackling the threat of terror has been a matter of continued dialogue between Russia and India under multiple frameworks, including the bilateral mechanism of the counter-terror working group."Counter-terrorism is part of each and every bilateral meeting. Rest assured we know about this danger and we are most willing to cooperate to deal with it," he said.The Russian envoy said his country would like to see the "future in Afghanistan with optimism" and there is a need to give some time to any new dispensation in Afghanistan."We are for an inclusive government in Afghanistan that can ensure sustainable development in the war-torn country. The Afghan people deserve peace, stability, and sustainable development just as any other nation in the world," Kudashev said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 24 discussed the developments in Afghanistan over a week after its capital Kabul fell to the Taliban.After the conversation, Russia said the two leaders expressed the intention to enhance cooperation to counter the dissemination of "terrorist ideology" and the drug threat emanating from Afghanistan and agreed to form a permanent bilateral channel for consultations on the issue.Russia has been a key player in pushing for the Afghan peace process before the Taliban captured power in Kabul. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/afghan-soil-should-not-be-source-of-terrorism-for-other-countries-russia-307536

06-09-2021||New Delhi||India, Australia navy exercise to promote stability in Indo-Pacific||India and Australia are conducting a joint maritime exercise to consolidate their shared commitment to regional and global security challenges and promote peace, security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.The Indian Navy Task Group comprising INS Shivalik and Kadmatt, under the command of Eastern Fleet Commander, Rear Admiral Tarun Sobti, is participating in the fourth edition of AUSINDEX from September 6 to September 10.Royal Australian Navy (RAN) Anzac Class Frigate, HMAS Warramunga, which participated in exercise Malabar along with the Indian Navy units, is part of the exercise."This edition of AUSINDEX includes complex surface, sub-surface, and air operations between ships, submarines, helicopters and Long Range Maritime Patrol Aircraft of the participating Navies," an Indian Navy statement said.The participating Indian Naval Ships Shivalik and Kadmatt are the latest indigenously-designed and built guided missile stealth frigate, and anti-submarine corvette, respectively.They form part of the Eastern Fleet based at Visakhapatnam under the Eastern Naval Command.Commenced in 2015 as a bilateral maritime exercise, AUSINDEX has grown in complexity over the years and the 3rd edition of the exercise, held in 2019 in the Bay of Bengal, included anti-submarine drills for the first time.In the fourth edition, the surface units of both the countries will be exercising with HMAS Rankin, a Collins Class Australian Submarine, Royal Australian Air Force P-8A and F-18A aircraft, along with integral helicopters of both the navies.The exercise will provide an opportunity for both navies to further bolster inter-operability, gain from best practices and develop a common understanding of procedures for maritime security operations, the statement said.It is a true representation of Joint Guidance signed by the Indian Navy chief and Royal Australian Navy chief on August 18, aligned to the '2020 Comprehensive Strategic Partnership' between the two nations and aims to further consolidate shared commitment to regional and global security challenges promoting peace, security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, it added.The conduct of this exercise despite Covid restrictions is also a testimony of existing synergy between the participating Navies, the statement said.

06-09-2021||New Delhi||Climate action cannot wait for Covid pandemic to end, 220 journals warn||The world leaders need to take immediate action to limit climate change, restore biodiversity, and protect health, according to an editorial published in over 220 leading journals, including The Lancet and the National Medical Journal of India.The editorial is being published ahead of the UN General Assembly, one of the last international meetings taking place before the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, UK in November.It warns that the greatest threat to global public health into the future is the continued failure of world leaders to take adequate action to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius and to restore nature.“The recent examples of extreme weather all over the globe have brought into focus the reality that climate change is,” said Peush Sahni, Editor-in-Chief of the National Medical Journal of India, and one of the co-authors of the editorial.“We must act now lest it is too late. We owe it to the future generations,” Sahni said.The authors warn that while recent targets to reduce emissions and conserve nature are welcome, they are not enough and are yet to be matched with credible short and longer term plans.They urge governments to intervene to transform societies and economies, for example, by supporting the redesign of transport systems, cities, production and distribution of food, markets for financial investments, and health systems.Richard Horton, Editor-in-Chief of The Lancet, said urgently addressing the climate crisis is one of the greatest opportunities for advancing the wellbeing of people worldwide.“The health community must do more to raise its critical voice in holding political leaders accountable for their actions to keep global temperature rises below 1.5 degrees Celsius,” Horton explained.The editorial argues that sufficient global action can only be achieved if high-income countries do far more to support the rest of the world and to reduce their own consumption.Developed countries must commit to increasing climate finance: fulfilling their outstanding commitment to provide USD 100 billion a year, have a dual focus on mitigation and adaptation, including improving the resilience of health systems, it said.The editorial argues that this money should be provided in the form of grants, rather than loans, and should come alongside forgiving large debts, which constrain the agency of so many low-income countries.Additional funding must be marshalled to compensate for inevitable loss and damage caused by the consequences of the environmental crisis, the authors noted.“While low and middle income countries have historically contributed less to climate change, they bear an inordinate burden of the adverse effects, including on health,” said Professor Lukoye Atwoli, Editor-in-Chief of the East Africa Medical Journal, and one of the co-authors of the editorial.“We therefore call for equitable contributions whereby the world’s wealthier countries do more to offset the impact of their actions on the climate, beginning now, and continuing into the future,” Atwoli said.Fiona Godlee, Editor-in-Chief of The BMJ, and one of the co-authors of the editorial noted that going above mean temperature of 1.5 degrees Celsius and allowing the continued destruction of nature will bring far deadlier crisis than Covid-19.“Wealthier nations must act faster and do more to support those countries already suffering under higher temperatures. 2021 has to be the year the world changes course—our health depends on it,” said Godlee.According to Eric J. Rubin, Editor-in-Chief of The New England Journal of Medicine, and one of the co-authors of the editorial, the environment and health are inextricably intertwined.“The changing climate is endangering us in many ways, including its critical impacts on health and health care delivery,” said Rubin.“As medical and public health practitioners, we have an obligation not only to anticipate new health care needs but also to be active participants in limiting the causes of the climate crisis,” they added.

Sangle and other villagers heard the leopard’s roars coming out of the well on early Sunday morning and informed the forest department.Both the animals were rescued safely from the 25 to 30 feet deep well with the help of a crane on late Sunday evening by the forest department, the official said.The leopard, which did not harm the cat during the face-off, was later released in its natural habitat, he added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/leopard-cat-come-face-to-face-after-falling-in-well-in-maharashtra-village-307527

It should be examined and action should be initiated against guilty officers,” the chief minister told the meeting.The chief minister also issued directions for making arrangements of additional beds, paramedical staff, medicine and testing equipment.The ÇM Helpline is taking feedback from the families of patients about the facilities available in hospitals, an official spokesperson said.Firozabad government medical college principal Dr Sangeeta Aneja had said on Sunday, “Today, 105 new patients of dengue and viral fever were admitted while 60 people recovered. As of now, 447 patients are admitted to various wards.”               Last week, three Firozabad doctors were suspended on charges of laxity.District Magistrate Chandra Vijay Singh on Thursday suspended the three doctors with immediate effect on charges of negligence and warned government doctors of strict action for any negligence in treatment to ailing people.The suspended doctors are Girish Srivastava of Primary Health Centre of Salai in Firozabad, Ruchi Srivastava, a public health expert, and Saurav.On Wednesday, Firozabad’s Chief Medical Officer Neeta Kulshresth had been removed following the spate of deaths, mostly children, since August 18 due to the viral fever and suspected cases of dengue.The chief minister had visited the district on August 30 to take stock of the situation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/firozabad-dengue-outbreak-uttar-pradesh-chief-minister-orders-strict-action-against-officials-found-lax-307520
06-09-2021||New Delhi||Reducing tax, doling subsidies to regulated recycling sector can help reduce lead pollution: Study||Reducing tax and providing subsidies to the regulated recycling sector can help reduce lead pollution from lead-acid battery recycling, a study by researchers from the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) Madras and Kanpur has found.Researchers from the two institutes have come together to look collectively at the problem of lead recycling in India as lead pollution can harm the mental and physical health of people and can contaminate the environment.The team’s research was aimed at finding out appropriate policy instruments that can help Indiareduce lead pollution. The results of the research have been published in international research journal ‘Resources, Conservation and Recycling’.According to the team, the workers who recycle lead in an informal setting break the lead-acid batteries in a fashion causing spillage of acid and lead dust in the soil and surroundings. Also, the lead is melted in open furnaces due to which poisonous gases reach the air. This way of lead recycling is not only harmful to the environment but also the health workers engaged in the recycling process.However, the low operational cost of this manoeuvre makes it still an attractive choice. The presence of the informal sector and its undesirable consequences are more predominant in developing countries where the costs and lenient regulations and laws have helped the unregulated sector to grow at a faster pace.The study suggested that policy guidelines such as reducing tax on the regulated recycling sector and providing subsidies to regulated recycling and re-manufacturing sectors reduce lead pollution from lead-acid battery recycling. Another important finding was that a very high subsidy to the formal re-manufacturing sector can lead to the shutting down of both regulated and unregulated recycling sectors.“The insufficiency of primary lead sources to satisfy the demand makes the recycling of used batteries necessary. However, the unscientific way of recycling by the unregulated sector poses serious environmental and health threats due to the high amount of lead excretion. We studied to quantitatively assess the impact of different policy instruments on shifting the recycling business from unorganized to the organized sector in India,” said R K Amit, Professor at Department of Management Studies, IIT Madras.In the study, the researchers have assessed the impact of policies such as reducing tax on regulated recyclers, subsidies to organised recyclers and formal battery re-manufacturers on the performance of battery recycling to name a few.The team used a system dynamics model to explore the implications of economic policies quantitatively on the recycling of used lead-acid batteries.“From the implementation point of view, the policymakers can consider the results of this study to frame policies and rules for the LAB recycling activity in India. As a natural course of future research, the implication of these policies on the social dimension, in terms of job loss in the unorganised sector and possible ways through which the unorganised sector’s workforce can be integrated with or relocated to the organised sector will be explored,” he said.Lead is used in various industries such as paints, cosmetics, dyes, ammunition, and jewellery,but the battery sector remains the major consumer of this metal by utilising 85 per cent of the production. Several rules on battery waste management, handling and recycling have been put in place at appropriate times by respective countries to handle lead pollution.Recycling was put forward as a good way to deal with the scarcity of metal and to handle the accompanying pollution. However, the proper recycling of lead is still a concern and it is lagging due to mushrooming of the unregulated battery recycling sector alongside the regulated ones.

06-09-2021||New Delhi||SC refuses to entertain plea for opening of Singhu border||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain a plea filed by residents of Sonipat seeking opening of the roads connecting Delhi and Haryana at Singhu border here, which have been blocked by farmers protesting against three agri laws and asked the petitioners to approach the High Court. A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli said that the petitioners has the freedom to approach the high court and state administration is also amenable to the directions of the high court to deal with maintaining a balance between freedom to protest and the freedom to access of basic amenities.It allowed the petition to be withdrawn and granted liberty to them to approach the Punjab and Haryana High Court.The top court said that the invitation to interfere is very tempting but there are High Courts, which can deal with the local issues.“Suppose, tomorrow there is a border dispute between Karnataka and Kerala or some other states. There will be no end to this. This court shall not be the first recourse. High Courts are there to deal with local problems. We have a robust system in place,” the bench said.At the outset, advocate Abhimanyu Bhandari, appearing for petitioners Jai Bhagwan and Jagbir Singh Chhikara, both residents of Sonipat, said that Singhu Border is like an "umbilical cord" for people of the city as it connects Delhi and Haryana but due to blockade this is hampering their right to movement.He said that petitioners are not against peaceful protest by farmers and they have nothing to do with three farm laws against which they are protesting.The bench said, “Why don't you approach the High court being resident of Sonipat? Why is this petition filed here for publicity? There is no need for us to intervene when high courts are well versed with the local conditions and the problems you all are facing. We should trust our High Courts”.Bhandari said that a coordinate bench of this court has recently passed an order with regard to the UP Gate protest in which the top court had asked the Centre to find a solution to the problem, so that no inconvenience is caused to the common people due to blockade of interstate roads. “At least allow opening of one side of the highway so that people can move in case of any kind of emergency,” he said.The plea filed through advocate Roohina Dua said that farmers at Singhu border here are protesting against three farm bills--Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. “Pertinently, on account of the said bills, thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November of 2020 at the Delhi borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh whereby they are demanding a rollback of the three laws”, the plea said. The petition said that even though the protests have been largely peaceful, the three primary locations of farmer protests are Ghazipur Border, Singhu Border, and Tikri Border, have been blocked by the protesters, thereby preventing free flow of traffic for the common people, residents, patients and those in need of medical support.  “The highway at Singhu Border between Delhi and Sonipat in Haryana has been blocked by the protesters since November last year which has caused immense hardship to the people, residents, patients and those in need of medical support of Sonipat which is a district in close proximity to Delhi,” it said.The plea said that due to Covid-19 the country has faced an unprecedented rise in the number of positive cases as well as the number of consequential deaths on account of the virus.  “This wave of the pandemic has not only increased the number of people affected by the virus exponentially, but has also created a situation where the essential basic medical facilities, including the availability of hospital beds and treatment medication are found to be lacking in a number of districts especially in Sonipat and other adjoining districts,” it said.The petitioners further said that the areas around Delhi, especially districts such as Sonipat faced an unprecedented rise in cases during the second wave.“Furthermore, since a majority portion of the district has a rural background, the ground reality of the Covid positive cases is much more than what is being reflected in the official government reporting,” the plea said.The petitioners sought directions to the concerned authorities to open the Singhu Border of Delhi (Sonepat-Delhi) and direction to temporarily shift the protestors at an allotted place for the free flow of traffic.Initially, the protests started from Punjab in November last year and later spread to Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and some other parts of the country.

06-09-2021||New Delhi||Rahul Gandhi ‘political cuckoo’ of Indian politics, says BJP||With Rahul Gandhi attacking the government over the farmers' protest, the BJP on Monday dubbed him as a “political cuckoo of Indian politics” who, it alleged, does not want to work on the ground and uses the shoulders of others for his political agenda.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra also accused the Congress leader of posting an old picture of farmers' protest while referring to their Sunday mahapanchayat in Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar district, and said this is part of his politics of “spreading confusion and lies”.“The Congress is without a (regular) president. It is incapable of raising ground issues. That is why Sonia Gandhi holds virtual meetings with leaders of other parties while Rahul Gandhi relies on old photographs in his attempt to spread confusion for politics,” Patra told a press conference.Sonia Gandhi is the interim president of the party.As a cuckoo does not build her nest and seeks comfort in nests of other birds, Rahul also works in a similar manner, he said.“He does not work to build his party's organisation. He does not work hard. It has become his habit to use others' shoulders for politics,” he said.With protesting farmer unions hitting out at the government, Patra claimed that the Modi dispensation was always dedicated to farmers and would remain so.He cited a number of measures taken by the government, including direct transfer of over Rs 1.5 lakh crore to farmers, and record procurement and payment for their produce, to make his point.Citing the Morning Consult survey that ranked Modi with the highest approval rating of 70 per cent among 13 heads of governments, including Joe Biden and Boris Johnson, Patra said it was possible because of the government's achievements, including a host of welfare measures for the poor, deprived and farmers.At the press conference, the BJP spokesperson also referred to India's Covid vaccination drive, which has been gathering pace and clocked over one crore jabs on two days recently, and hit out at Rahul, who had earlier criticised the alleged slow pace of inoculation.Over 68.75 crore people have received at least one dose of vaccination, which has reached an average daily figure of 85 lakh, he said.“Now Rahul Gandhi is not seen posting any tweet on the vaccination drive,” he said.

06-09-2021||New Delhi||It was not ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’ but political rally, says BJP Kisan Morcha chief Rajkumar Chahar||A day after the Muzaffarnagar ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’, the BJP on Monday accused BKU (Tikait) leader Rakesh Tikait of “defaming” farmers by politicising the issue and giving it “religious tones to appease a particular community” for political interests .Talking to The Tribune, BJP Kisan Morcha chief Rajkumar Chahar alleged that Tikait is “fulfilling his political ambition by riding on the shoulders of innocent farmers” as the majority of participants at the “political rally” yesterday were cadres of the SP, the RLD and communist parties.“Otherwise what were communist leaders and their supporters like Yogendra Yadav, Medha Patkar, Atul Anjan were doing there,” he questioned.“It is wrong to call the political rally a ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’. A ‘mahapanchayat’ is never one sided, it is a dialogue, a debate on issues. What happened yesterday was a political rally by political leaders for personal political gains by communalising and appeasing a particular community. Why else did Tikait chant ‘Allah-ho-Akbar’ from the stage there,” questioned Chahar.When pointed out that Tikait had also chanted ‘Har Har Mahadev’, the BJP’s Fatehpur Sikri MP challenged him to make “his political supporters from the minority community chant ‘Har Har Mahadev’ and ‘Jai Shri Ram’ from the stage”.“By chanting Allah-ho-Akbar, Tikait has made his political agenda clear,” he claimed.Notably, accusing the Narendra Modi-led Centre and Yogi Adityanath-led state government of dividing people on communal lines, Tikait shouted both ‘Allah-ho-Akbar’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’ from the stage, stating that in earlier times the slogans used to be chanted together.According to political observer Prof Sudhir Panwar (who belongs to the region), Tikait’s father, late farmer leader Mahendra Singh Tikait, also used to chant ‘Har Har Mahadev’ and ‘Allah-ho-Akbar’ at his meetings and make people from both communities repeat after him to promote Hindu-Muslim unity.Meanwhile, Chahar also said that “through these agriculture reforms the BJP is fulfilling the dreams of ‘mahatma’ Mahendra Singh Tikait and Charan Singh of increasing farmers’ income and bringing prosperity in the rural India”.He refused to comment on the BJP’s Pilibhit MP Varun Gandhi’s statement yesterday, urging the government to “re-engage” with farmers in a “respectful manner”, “understand their pain and point of view” and reach a “common ground”.The BJP Kisan Morcha president said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government is always sensitive on the issue of farmers and its doors are always open. All the steps and policy decisions taken by the government, including the increase in the MSP and the DBT, are directed towards farmers’ welfare”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/it-was-not-kisan-mahapanchayat-but-political-rally-says-bjp-kisan-morcha-chief-rajkumar-chahar-307500

Therefore, to paint the prosecution by saying that it is dilatory tactics is not fair,” the prosecutor said.  The fresh application was filed after Prasad submitted that the court hearing the plea is a special court designated under UAPA Act and therefore exercises all powers that are before the Court of Magistrate within the rigours of section 437 of CrPC.ASJ Rawat sought the police reply on the fresh bail application and posted the matter to September 8.In the last hearing on the bail plea on September 3, Khalid told the court that the charge sheet in the case has made hyperbolic allegations without any factual basis and reads like a script from a web series and news channels.Delhi Police had earlier said the bail plea had no merit and that it will demonstrate the prima facie case against him before the court by referring to the charge sheet filed in the case.Khalid, along with several others, has been booked under the anti-terror law in the case. They are accused of being the "masterminds" of the February 2020 violence, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. He has sought bail in the case.

She wanted the the announcement by the end of this year. During the meeting, she said the announcement of names of candidates by December 25 would be ideal, but should not be delayed beyond December 31.She asked the party leaders to identify panels of names of potentially winning candidates keeping the deadline in sight.Mayawati is of the view that early announcement of the names of candidates for elections in UP and Uttarakhand would give them ample time to focus and plan their election campaign.  The BSP has high stakes in UP where it will be pitted against the ruling BJP-led NDA, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress.      With regard to Punjab, the Mayawati is said to be inclined to go by the electoral strategy drawn up by its senior ally, the SAD, along with the state BSP.However, inputs of the state BSP on the ground realities will be factored in by Mayawati.BSP attaches importance to Punjab as its founder Kanshi Ram hailed from the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mayawati-wants-early-announcement-of-names-of-bsp-candidates-for-assembly-elections-in-up-and-uttarakhand-307489

He told reporters that he was questioned non-stop for around eight hours.Banerjee, who told reporters in the morning before entering the ED office that as a citizen it was his duty to cooperate in the probe, was quite flustered when he emerged from the ED office after long hours of interrogation. He said he did not blame the ED officers for grilling him because they were doing so under instruction from the political leadership.Without naming Suvendu Adhikari, Banerjee said people seen accepting money in sting video footage were going scot free while BJP’s political opponents were being harassed.“I have been telling BJP from day one that if they have any proof against me, it should be made public, Banerjee said.The TMC leader added that unlike other political parties, TMC cannot be intimidated by using ED, CBI, Income Tax and other agencies.“No mai ka lal has guts to intimidate TMC. We will take on the BJP alone and defeat them in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections”, Banerjee said.Banerjee was summoned for questioned by ED about his association with the kingpin of illegal mining, Anup Majhi, as well as the illicit funds allegedly transferred to his family members, sources said.Abhishek’s wife Rujira was also summoned by the ED to Delhi but she sought to be questioned at her residence in Kolkata due to the Covid-19 situation. Rujira was earlier questioned by CBI in her Kolkata residence in connection with the case.Adhikari was asked by the Criminal Investigation Department of West Bengal Police to appear before it today in a 2018 case of unnatural death of one of his security staff, which is now being probed as a possible murder case. Adhikari sent an email in the morning saying he could not come as he had several political programmes to attend during the day.The Calcutta High Court later stayed the probe into the unnatural death complaint registered in Contai. It also stayed another case related to a political clash at Nandigram and yet another case of gold chain snatching at Panskura involving Adhikari.The court also noted that Adhikari had been summoned in the security staff death case three years after the incident.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abhishek-banerjee-grilled-by-ed-suvendu-gets-relief-from-court-307469

He was 66In a tragic irony, Desiraju died on the day the country observes the birth anniversary of his grandfather and late President Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. Only recently had Desiraju moved to Chennai, where he was engaged in a project to open his grandfather S Radhakrishnan’s house for public good.“He wanted to build a library in his ancestral house and had been working on the project for quite a while. It is a devastating loss for so many people. Keshav was a man of integrity and great vision and the most understated leader I have known,” says Poonam Muttreja, Executive Director of Population Foundation of India, whose governing Board Desiraju chaired after he retired from the government as secretary, consumer affairs.A man of many talents, he was a carnatic singer himself and wrote the biography of legendary MS Subbulakshmi. Desiraju will be remembered most for his contributions to the Indian anti-tobacco movement, the 2014 National Mental Health Policy and the cleansing of Medical Council of India corruption, when he was the union health secretary.Desiraju was transferred out of the Health Ministry in February 2014 for his alleged role in blocking the re-nomination of disgraced former MCI president Ketan Desai back into the council. The transfer happened under Congress veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad as health minister, but the foundations Desiraju laid led to the ultimate scrapping of the MCI and its replacement with the Board of Governors.During his stint in the department of personnel and training, Desiraju, a 1978-batch IAS officer of the Uttarakhand cadre, was among officers instrumental in piloting a policy shift that would go on to open up the administrative services for the differently abled.He put mental health on India’s map, led the national commitments to the UN Framework Convention for Tobacco Control and remained the force behind the declaration of Bengaluru’s NIMHANS as the institute of national importance. Desiraju passed away after a heart attack at his Chennai home on Sunday.

Former Vice President Amrullah Saleh, who heads the anti-Taliban forces in Panjshir, appealed for humanitarian aid to help those displaced.A senior Taliban spokesman tweeted that Taliban troops had overrun Rokha district, one of the largest of eight districts in Panjshir, even as the National Resistance Front said it had trapped some Taliban fighters in a narrow gorge at the mouth of Panjshir Valley. There was no conclusive evidence from either side to establish their claims.Meanwhile, the delay in announcing the leadership in Kabul continues. A Taliban leader reiterated that a supreme leader (Amir al-Mu’minin) would be the spiritual head of Afghanistan and there would be a PM to run the government, but there were no further details on the government composition.Sources close to the Taliban say the new government could be an interim arrangement and a Loya Jirga could be convened to form a permanent government.

Uttar Pradesh is out of the coverage of SRE as its three districts — Chandauli, Mirzapur and Sonebhadra — no longer require targeted interventions for containing Naxalism, they informed.Under the SRE scheme, the Centre reimburses the bulk of the expenditure incurred by the Naxal-hit states, including ex gratia payment to civilians and security personnel killed by the ultras besides the expenses on mobility, logistics and communication as also ammunition used for operations against the ultras by Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and the respective police forces, among others.“The move follows a comprehensive review of the Naxal-hit states. The number of districts covered under the SRE scheme has now come down from 90 in 11 states to 70 in 10 states. SRE districts and the most affected districts were last revised in 2018,” a senior security official said.Meanwhile, based on the criteria of Maoist violent incidents, a separate category of “Most-affected districts” was created in 2015 with 35 districts to ensure focused deployment of resources. Subsequently, following a review in 2018, the number of districts was brought down to 30.

The BJP, however, justified the move, saying all sections of society should know about “patriots who are nation's ideals”.The minister said the first-year MBBS students would also learn about Maharshi Charaka, one of the principal contributors to ayurveda, and sage Sushrut, known as the father of surgery in India.The next academic session for MBBS students is likely to start by this year-end.“The National Medical Council has said that ethical values should be the part of the foundation course in the first year.

He is apparently upset over an attack on BJP MLA Umesh Malik in Tikait’s village, Sisauli. Farmer leaders, however, insisted that other members of Gathwal Malik “khap” attended the event.Read also Must re-engage with farmers: VarunThey (farmers) are our flesh and blood. We must re-engage with them in a respectful manner, understand their pain and their point of view. —Varun Gandhi, BJPThey have political motives: BJPThe UP BJP accused event organisers of having political motives and claimed it was attended by workers of parties brought from other states. It maintained that no govt had done as much for farmers as the one led by PM Modi.Rahul: Unjust govt will have to listenThe Congress voiced support for mahapanchayat with party leader Rahul Gandhi saying an “unjust government” would have to listen to the farmers.This apart, the event saw a mammoth gathering with farmers from Punjab and Haryana making up more than 50 per cent of the total strength. Unions reiterated their resolve to continue the protest, giving a call for a bandh on September 27.Demanding Rs 450 per quintal SAP for sugarcane in UP, Tikait attacked the economic policies of the Modi government. “India has been put up for sale and national assets are being sold to the private sector,” he said, lashing out at National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP).Emphasising that the government needed “vote ki chot” (defeat through votes), he said the slogan of “fasalon ke daam nahi to vote nahi” would have to be raised.Referring to PM Modi, CM Yogi and Home Minister Amit Shah as “outsiders”, Tikait said he had no objection if they become PM after winning from Uttarakhand or Gujarat, “but on the soil of Uttar Pradesh they will not be tolerated”.Notably, BJP’s Pilibhit MP Varun Gandhi and Muzaffarnagar MP Sanjiv Balyan demanded resumption of talks between the government and protesting unions.Farmers’ leaders made it clear that they would campaign against the BJP in UP and Uttarakhand, if their demands were not accepted. They threatened to continue the agitation till the 2024 Lok Sabha poll. “They (the Centre) said only a handful of farmers are protesting. Let us raise our voice so it reaches the ears of those sitting in Parliament,” the speakers said. The next meeting will be held in Lucknow to back cane growers.Observer and Samajwadi leader Prof Sudhir Panwar said slogans of “Har Har Mahadev” and “Allah Hu Akbar” were raised. The meeting was successful in expressing the message of Hindu-Muslim unity, he said.A woman leader from Karnataka addressed the gathering in Kannada.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/muzaffarnagar-kisan-mahapanchayat-will-stay-put-at-delhi-borders-till-demands-met-say-farm-leaders-307045

The comments have hurt the sentiments of the class as well as social harmony and I am also pained by it,” the CM was quoted as saying in a release issued by the state public relations department.The CM also said through social media and other platforms, he has learnt it is being said that action against Nand Kumar Baghel will not be taken because he is father of the chief minister. “Every person is equal before my government,” he said.“Everyone knows about my ideological differences with my father. Our political thoughts and beliefs are very much different. I respect him as his son, but as the CM, I cannot forgive him for such mistakes which disturb the public order,” he added.“Nobody is above the law in my government even if he is the chief minister’s 86-year-old father,” the CM said, adding that an appropriate legal action will be ensured by police in this regard.He said the Chhattisgarh government respects every religion, caste and community and their sentiments, and gives equal importance to everyone.“It is our duty to protect the dignity and constitutional rights of everyone.

Akhtar had said in the interview that all right-wing groups across the world wanted the same things."Like the Taliban want an Islamic State, there are those who want a Hindu Rashtra. These people are of the same mindset —be it Muslim, Christian, Jews or Hindus," Akhtar, a former Member of Parliament, had said.Kadam said in a video that unless he apologised for his remarks, he and his supporters would not allow any of his movies to get a release in this “Ma Bharti” (motherland) until he apologised with “folded hands to crores of supporters and workers of the Sangh”.“The fact that he was able to say such things without fear of reprisal shows how false they truly are. Could he have made such statements had the RSS been like the Taliban,” Kadam said in videos he made in Marathi and Hindi."This statement by Javed Akhtar is not just shameful, but also painful and humiliating to crores of functionaries of the Sangh and the Vishva Hindu Parishad and also crores of people across the world that follow their ideology," Kadam said in a video message that he also shared on Twitter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-bjp-mla-demands-apology-from-javed-akhtar-for-comparing-rss-to-taliban-307078
