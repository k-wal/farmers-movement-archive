09-09-2021||World community’s five expectations from Taliban||India, EU unlikely to give early recognition to Taliban regime||Respect for fundamental human rightsContinued possibilities of safe passagePreservation of humanitarian accessFight against terrorist groups like al-Qaida and ISAn inclusive transitional governmentTribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 9 Though a new Taliban government could be sworn in this week, India and other major countries are unlikely to give it early recognition if the trend of discussions at a conference of 20 Foreign Ministers that ended late on Wednesday night is any indication.The five major expectations from the Taliban were set out by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and reiterated by the co-convener of the conference Heiko Mass.The international community wants unhindered departure of those wishing to leave Afghanistan; free access to humanitarian aid; the total severing of relations with terrorist organisations; respect for human rights, especially women’s rights; and the establishment of a transitional government within the framework of the Doha negotiations.These points were also underlined by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar who also added that Afghanistan must not tolerate interference in its affairs by external players, especially those who are trying to intensify violence.“Any further-reaching engagement will depend on the Taliban’s actions. An interim government that does not include any other groups, and yesterday’s violence against protesters and journalists in Kabul, are not signals to make us optimistic,” noted the German Foreign Minister.“We can only note that these demands have not been met. Their actions do not match their words,” seconded French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Driand while referring to five points that have become the common demand of a large number of countries.The idea of a conference took shape after most countries supported each other in evacuating their nationals and loyal Afghans. “We want to take a joint and coordinated approach in the next phase, too, particularly with regard to how we handle the new power-holders in Kabul,” said Maas.Japan also urged the Taliban to enable safe passage of people and to ensure an inclusive political process. Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said a sustained international engagement with Afghanistan will be the best counterterrorism investment for all.In attendance were representatives of Germany, Australia, Bahrain, Canada, France, India, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Norway, Pakistan, Qatar, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, the UAE, the UK, Uzbekistan, the EU, NATO and the UN.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-eu-unlikely-to-give-early-recognition-to-taliban-regime-308894

09-09-2021||Chandigarh||Measurement of magnetic field offers rare peek into inner workings of the Sun||Indian scientists, along with international collaborators, have measured the magnetic field of an eruption from the Sun’s atmosphere offering a rare peek to the interior of the Sun. Observing the weak thermal radio emission associated with the erupted plasma for the first time, the study of the phenomenon happening in the Sun’s atmosphere or the solar corona provides insights into the inner workings of the Sun.The Sun is an extremely active object, spewing out vast quantities of gas in many violent events and the corona is a region of very high temperatures, strong magnetic fields, and violent plasma eruptions.A class of such eruptions are Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), which are the most powerful explosions happening in our solar system. When a really strong CME blows past the Earth, it can damage the electronics in our satellites and disrupt radio communication networks on Earth.Hence, astronomers regularly study these events which also helps to understand space weather.A team of scientists from the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), along with their collaborators, used data from their radio telescopes to measure the magnetic field and other physical conditions of the plasma in a CME.The use of radio telescopes of IIA located in Karnataka along with some space-based telescopes allowed the researchers to detect a much weaker radio emission called thermal or blackbody radiation from the plume of gas that was ejected in the CME. They were also able to measure the polarisation of this emission, which is indicative of the direction in which the electric and magnetic components of the waves oscillate. Using this data, they then calculated the physical properties of the ejected plasma as well. “Though CMEs can occur anywhere on the Sun, it is primarily those which originate from regions near the centre of the visible solar surface, called the photosphere, that are important for us, since they may propagate directly towards the Earth,” R Ramesh, Professor at IIA, and the lead researcher of the study, said in a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology today.“These CMEs are usually studied in visible light, but because the disc of the Sun is so much brighter, we can detect and follow these CMEs only when they have travelled beyond the Sun’s surface. However, radio observations of the thermal emission, like in our study, lets us study the CMEs right from the surface itself,” added,” A. Kumari, a co-author.“Knowing the source region of the CMEs, the associated magnetic field and their kinematics in the region up to seven lakh kilometre either above the solar surface or off its limb, is important to fully understand the characteristics of the CMEs in a holistic manner,” said C. Kathiravan, another co-author of the study.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/measurement-of-magnetic-field-offers-rare-peek-into-inner-workings-of-the-sun-308877
09-09-2021||Shillong||Kongthong among 3 Indian entries for UNWTO ‘Best Village Contest’: Meghalaya CM||Meghalaya’s whistling village – Kongthong – in East Khasi Hills district has been selected as one of three India entries for the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) ‘Best Tourism Village’ contest, Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma said.Kongthong, a small village nestled in the Khat-ar Shnong area about 60 km to the south of Shillong, is famous for its panoramic view, unique culture and virgin beauty.“#Meghalaya’s whistling village Kongthong is selected for entry to the @UNWTO ‘Best Tourism Village’ along with 2 other villages in the country,” the chief minister tweeted.The UNWTO is looking for the best examples of rural villages which harness the power of tourism to safeguard communities, local traditions and heritage, an official here told PTI.He said the UNWTO wants to identify villages taking innovative and transformative approaches to tourism in rural areas in line with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).‘Best Tourism Villages by UNWTO’ aims to maximise contribution of the sector to reducing regional inequalities and fighting against rural depopulation.It also seeks to advance the role of tourism in valuing and safeguarding rural villages along with their associated landscapes, knowledge systems, biological and cultural diversity, local values and activities, including gastronomy, he added.Kongthong, one of the 12 ‘shnong’ (villages) have a unique practice of assigning a tune to a baby at birth. The tune remains with the baby until his death and this practice is gaining popularity now, Rothel Khongsit, a youth leader from Kongthong said.Although Kongthong is now popularly known as “whistling village”, a term coined by few reporters, Khongsit said it does not depict the real practice which is called ‘rwai sur iaw-bei’.Meghalaya Rural Tourism Forum chairman Alan West said the tradition is in no way associated with whistling.“While appreciating the Government of India for proposing Kongthong village as the best tourism village before the UNWTO, I would urge the Meghalaya government to correct the mistake of calling Kongthong a whistling village.”“The unique tradition of the people of 12 shnong (not only Kongthong) by assigning a song as a name to a newborn child in no way is associated with whistling,” he said, adding that the tradition of villagers of 12 shnong is an act where the individual actually produce verbal utterance of words in the form of a song when naming a child which is totally different from someone who is producing a sound from their mouth in the form of whistling.Finance Minister N Sitharaman and Rajya Sabha MP Rakesh Sinha who has adopted the village since 2019 have congratulated the state and the chief minister on this achievement.“Congratulations Meghalaya on Kongthong being selected ‘best tourism village. The village in which people compose a tune for calling a person in place of names,” Sitharaman tweeted.Sinha on the other hand said, “Whistling village Kongthong, adopted by me since 2019, has been selected for entry into the UNTWO best tourism village in the world. Thanks to PM Sh @narendramodi ji for promoting village tourism. Thanks @sangmaConrad for his help.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kongthong-among-3-indian-entries-for-unwto-best-village-contest-meghalaya-cm-308872
09-09-2021||London||2 Indian teachers shortlisted for 2021 Global Teacher Prize||Satyam Mishra, a mathematics teacher from Bhagalpur in Bihar, and Meghana Musunuri, a social studies, English and math teacher from Hyderabad have made it to the top 50 shortlist for this year’s USD 1-million Global Teacher Prize announced on Thursday.The USD 1-million Global Teacher Prize, organised by the Varkey Foundation in partnership with UNESCO, attracted over 8,000 nominations and applications from 121 countries.“It is only by prioritising education that we can safeguard all our tomorrows. Education is the key to facing the future with confidence,” said Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey Foundation.Mishra made the cut for his determination to change the way children look at the world and uses cool multiplication tricks to bring his subject alive for students.Musunuri, the second Indian teacher on the 2021 shortlist, is described as an education futurist, philanthropist and a passionate entrepreneur as the founder and chairperson of Fountainhead Global School & Junior College and also Hyderabad Champion for Google’s Women Entrepreneurs On The Web (WEOW), guiding women entrepreneurs in establishing their online presence.“UNESCO is a proud partner of the Global Teacher Prize, which has done so much to highlight teachers’ transformational role in young people’s lives. Inspirational teachers and extraordinary students alike deserve recognition for their commitment to education amid the learning crisis we see today,” said Stefania Giannini, Assistant Director General for Education at UNESCO.“If we are to rebuild a better world in the wake of Covid we must prioritise giving every child their birthright of a quality education. It is the next generation, with teachers as their guide, who will safeguard the future for us all,” she said.Alongside, an inaugural sister prize – the Chegg.Org Global Student Prize – includes four Indian students in the top 50 shortlist with Kaif Ali, a 21-year-old architecture student at Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi; Aayush Gupta, a 23-year-old MBA student at IIM Ahmedabad; and Seema Kumari, a 17-year-old student from Jharkhand; and Vipin Kumar Sharma, a 24-year-old student from the Central University of Haryana.The prize money for the new student prize has now also been doubled to USD 100,000.“In this age of Covid, students like Kaif, Aayush, Seema and Vipin have shown great courage to keep studying and keep fighting for a better future despite huge obstacles,” said Lila Thomas, Head of Chegg.org.“We were so inspired by the achievements of these extraordinary students throughout the world that applied for the inaugural Global Student Prize that Chegg chose to double the value of the prize to USD 100,000,” she said.Students who applied for the Global Student Prize are being assessed on their academic achievement, impact on their peers, how they make a difference in their community and beyond, how they overcome the odds to achieve, how they demonstrate creativity and innovation, and how they operate as global citizens.Following the shortlist announcement, the top 10 finalists of both prizes will be announced next month.The winners will be chosen by the Global Teacher Prize Academy and the Global Student Prize Academy, respectively, and unveiled at an awards ceremony in Paris in November.Last year’s Global Teacher Prize winner was Ranjitsinh Disale from Maharashtra.

09-09-2021||Jorhat (Assam)||Criminal case, high-level probe in Brahmaputra boat capsize: Assam CM Himanta||Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday ordered filing of a criminal case over capsizing of a boat plying to Majuli, that claimed one life, while two persons are still missing.Sarma banned all single-engine private boats from plying to Majuli with immediate effect and announced that the construction of a proposed bridge between Jorhat and Majuli will start from November 2021 and will be completed in four years.After visiting the accident site with senior officials, the Chief Minister told reporters that initial probe indicated “mismanagement” to be the prime reason for the accident, which occurred on Wednesday evening.“I have asked the Jorhat Police to file a criminal case. By today evening, we will announce a high-level probe to find out the reasons behind the accident,” he said.The Chief Minister also said that there are 10 private machine boats with single engines that operate between Nimati Ghat in Jorhat on the southern bank of Brahmaputra to Majuli, the world’s largest river island.“From today, no single engine boats will be allowed to Majuli. Those engines are not marine engines. However, if an owner wants to transform them into marine engines, we will support them,” he added.Sarma said a marine engine costs around Rs 10 lakh, which will be provided to willing private owners by the government immediately after their application.“Out of the total amount, 75 per cent will be government subsidy and 25 per cent will be given as loan. They can start applying from today at the Office of the Deputy Commissioner of Majuli,” he said.Talking about the much-delayed bridge between Jorhat and Majuli, Sarma said it was a EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) contract and the drawing of the structure has been submitted to the central government.“Today morning I spoke to the Centre, which will construct the bridge. Once the drawing is approved, construction will start from November. After that, it will take four years to complete. A ministerial group will be formed to monitor its progress,” he added.To connect Majuli with the mainland, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari had in February 2016 laid the foundation of a bridge over the Brahmaputra connecting Jorhat on the south bank and Lakhimpur on the north bank via the river island.For the same bridge, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in February this year again laid the foundation stone for the eight-km long Jorhat-Majuli bridge, to be constructed at a cost of Rs 925 crore, before the Assembly polls.Sarma also said a total of 90 persons were travelling on the ill-fated private boat. Out of them, one person died and two are still missing. Overnight search and rescue operations found 87 persons alive.“We have one person confirmed dead and two persons still missing. We can only hope that these missing persons are alive. A massive joint rescue operation is going on in the area and downstream,” he added.Sarma said the deceased was identified as Parimita Das, who hails from Guwahati and was working as a faculty in Rangachahi College in Majuli.“The missing persons have been identified as Indreswar Bora from Lakhimpur and Dr Bikramjit Barua from Jorhat. No tickets were issued or names were noted while boarding the boat. If this figure changes, we will inform,” he added.The Chief Minister also said that there are two ropax ferries of the Inland Water Transport (IWT) Department stationed at Nimati Ghat and the state government will find out why these were not in operation.“These vessels need deep water and it is not an issue during this monsoon season. There must be corruption issues involved (in not running the ropax). We will find out and take steps,” he added.The Chief Minister said four government ferries are available at Nimati Ghat and two more will be sent from Guwahati, taking the total ferries to six along with the two ropax vessels.He also admitted there are allegations that the government ferries are deliberately run at odd hours, forcing people to commute in the unsafe private boats during the peak hours.“We will correct everything. Now one magistrate each in Jorhat and Majuli will monitor the timings. You will see the situation improving considerably in the next 10-15 days,” Sarma said.He also said that 2-3 new ramps will be provided at Nimati Ghat for parking the ferries. Only one ramp is functioning at present as water level in Brahmaputra is high due to monsoon rains.“As only one ramp is operational, any outgoing ferry has to give way to the incoming one. Why the private boat was allowed to leave when the incoming ferry had not reached. There is a serious management issue. A system has to be there,” Sarma said.On Wednesday night, three officials of the IWT Department were placed under suspension for negligence of duty, while senior ministers admitted that there were lapses and the “guilty” will be punished.Sarma said he has asked Transport Minister Chandra Mohan Patowary to create a channel for ropax by dredging the Brahmaputra so that these large vessels can ply during winters also.“The fitness and health of the people engaged in these ferries and boats are of prime concern. We will soon issue an SOP regarding this,” he said without elaborating.The Chief Minister also said there were allegations that the expert old driver of the private boat was removed a few days ago and an inexperienced young hand was hired at a lower salary.“These issues should have been looked after by field level officers. When field officers fail, the government fails. We missed these small things while looking for the big works, which is the bridge,” he added.From Nimati Ghat, Sarma visited Jorhat Medical College and Hospital and enquired about the condition of  passengers being treated there.“The patients are more shocked than injured. Some said all their documents were washed away, we will reissue them. Some people said their motorcycles were washed away, we will compensate them,” he said at the hospital premises.Sarma later visited Majuli and assessed the situation there.Officials at IWT Department said the private boat ‘Ma Kamala’ was heading to Majuli from Nimati Ghat on the southern bank with passengers and vehicles, while a government ferry ‘MB Tipkai’ was coming from the world’s largest river island when the two collided.Majuli is the centre of neo-Vaishnavite culture initiated by medieval-age 15th-16th century Srimanta Sankardeva, Assam’s famed saint-scholar and socio-religious reformer.

09-09-2021||Mumbai||Noted women’s rights activist Sonal Shukla dies at 80||Noted women’s rights activist Sonal Shukla died after cardiac arrest in Mumbai on Thursday, a colleague said.Shukla (80) was the founder and managing trustee of the Vacha Charitable Trust and worked with adolescent girls and women for four decades.Popularly known as Sonal Ben, Shukla was the co-founder of the group ‘Forum Against Rape’, now known as the ‘Forum Against Oppression of Women’.Vacha started in 1987 as a library and women's resource centre. It was the first only women's book library with a collection of over 3,000 books. In 1991, it produced two music albums and two documentaries on women in the Independence movement.As a college teacher, she was in charge of projects involving sanitation workers and fisher folk, Mumbai's indigenous inhabitants.She turned her own home into a support centre for battered women for two years.Shukla had trained in Mahatma Gandhi's educational methods and had worked with the most deprived sections. Vacha gave space to poor girls to escape from family and community strangleholds through a programme of life skills and community work.“She taught us so many things, helped us improve our English and general knowledge and conducted so many activities for girls,” said Dr Varsha Gupta, who runs a clinic in suburban Santacruz.Gupta told PTI that she was not in touch with Shukla for a long time.“I was eight when I first met her. Vacha staff taught us an hour or two before classes in the municipal school I was in began. This continued till I was 12 or 13,” Gupta said.

09-09-2021||New York||As its immediate neighbour, India has one of the highest stakes in development in Afghanistan: Meenakashi Lekhi||As an immediate neighbour of Afghanistan with long-standing historical linkages, India has one of the highest stakes in the development in the war-torn country, Minister of State for External Affairs Meenakashi Lekhi has said, highlighting that the USD 3 billion Indian investment in different welfare projects was aimed for the benefit of the Afghan people.Lekhi, in an exclusive interview to PTI, said India's contributions for the people of Afghanistan, having executed development and welfare projects across all of its 34 provinces, were aimed for the benefit of its people.“As an immediate neighbour of Afghanistan with long standing historical linkages, we have one of the highest stakes in the development in the country,” Lekhi said.She noted that under India's presidency of the Security Council last month, the Council adopted Resolution 2593 which unequivocally underlined that Afghan territory should not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter, train terrorists, or plan or finance terrorist acts.“It particularly underlined that terrorists, individuals and entities designated by UNSC resolution 1267, which is of direct importance to India, should not find support in Afghanistan's territory and recalled the Taliban's commitments," she said.The Taliban seized control of war-torn Afghanistan in mid-August, ousting the previous elected leadership which was backed by the West.Lekhi said the resolution further had clear provisions regarding upholding human rights, especially of Afghan women, children and minorities.“This is particularly significant. It also calls for inclusive negotiated settlement and for urgent humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. These are all key aspects which have been consistently highlighted by India and resonate with our thinking,” Lekhi said.Under India's Presidency for the month of August, the Council held three sessions on Afghanistan and issued three press statements on August 3, 16 and 27, the last one strongly condemning the "deplorable attacks" near the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul on August 26.

09-09-2021||Vibha Sharma||While BJP accuses Owaisi and Mayawati of communal politics in UP, social media rife with two being saffron party’s’ ‘B team’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 9While the BJP is accusing All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi and BSP supremo Mayawati of doing “communal politics in the state”, some social media “influencers” have started sending “warnings” to members of the minority community that the two (Owaisi and Mayawati) are the “B-team” of the BJP trying to “divide Muslims” and dent “the traditional vote base” of main rival Samajwadi Party.Urging Muslims in UP to “learn from West Bengal which did not get influenced by Owaisi” despite “his best intentions to cut Muslim votes so that the BJP could win”, they claimed that the AIMIM chief “is contesting in UP so that the BJP can win”.This is not the first time the four-time Lok Sabha MP from Hyderabad has faced such allegations. He was “single-handedly” held responsible for the defeat of the Grand Alliance in Bihar in 2020 by the RJD. Terming him the “B-team of the BJP-RSS”, senior RJD leader Shivanand Tiwari said that “Owaisi fought at the behest of the BJP in order to defeat the Grand Alliance in Bihar” in “an election that could, otherwise, had the potential to change the politics of the country”.Beginning his political campaign from Ayodhya, Owaisi on Tuesday said that he had come to UP “to defeat the BJP” and attacked SP, alleging that Muslims had been “cheated” in the name of secularism by parties like it. “Our first effort is that our Muslim leadership should be developed in the biggest state of the country,” he said addressing a rally at Rasulabad village in the Muslim-dominated Rudauli constituency in Ayodhya. The AIMIM leader urged members of his community not to live “in the shadows. Nineteen per cent (of voters) are Muslims and nine per cent are Yadavs. But the CM will be yours (Yadavs) and we (Muslims) will not even get the job of a peon,” he was quoted as saying.Owaisi claimed that Yadav voters were not voting for Muslim candidates and said that his party was prepared to contest 100 of the 403 Assembly seats in UP.The Samajwadi Party, which is relying on the Muslim-Yadav combination to reclaim the state, is currently the top-most challenger to the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP in the state.Observers say any dent in the traditional vote bank of the Samajwadi Party will only benefit the BJP.Interestingly, while commending “efforts for Hindu-Muslim communal harmony” at the Muzaffarnagar 'kisan mahapanchayat', Mayawati also took on the Samajwadi Party saying “this will certainly help a little in healing the wounds of the horrific riots that took place under the SP government in 2013, but it will also make many uncomfortable.“Farmers are the pride of the country and the chants of Hindu-Muslim unity from the stage have shaken the political grounds of hatred sown by the BJP. Muzaffarnagar also made people remember the riots during the Congress and SP rules,” she said.Accusing Owaisi of "communal politics", BJP Kannauj MP Subrat Pathak said Yogi Adityanath would not allow “Jinnah’s jihadi mentality” to flourish in UP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/while-bjp-accuses-owaisi-and-mayawati-of-communal-politics-in-up-social-media-rife-with-two-being-saffron-partys-b-team-308818

Many leaders, including those whose opinion matters, have suggested great caution on the matter. The ball is in Sonia Gandhi's court," said a leader who was among those consulted.Another CWC member who was called for discussions said party revamp and new structures for greater democratization of the institution are also being discussed, along the lines G23 had proposed in August 2020."These structures may not take shape in the form they were originally proposed by G23. For instance, there may not be a parliamentary board as the G 23 had suggested but there may be a compact empowered committee. The good thing is we are finally talking," said an AICC leader.Commencement of discussions coincides with several members of G23 being given important party roles. Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor were included in Lok Sabha strategy group; Ghulam Nabi Azad and BS Hooda are in the Congress panel to mark 75 years of Independence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-begins-consultations-for-wider-cong-revamp-308477

The second wave had such an impact across the country that it cannot be presumed that all deaths happened due to negligence.Courts cannot have a presumption that all Covid deaths happened due to medical negligence, which your petition does.” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said. It asked the petitioner Deepak Raj Singh to approach the competent authority with his suggestions.

If you have any suggestion with regard to implementation of that policy, you can approach the competent authority,” it said.The Bench also refused to pass a general order to the authorities for door-to-door vaccination, saying it was “not feasible”.“With one brush you want an order for the entire country.

They accused the government of “misusing” the term “comprehensive costs”, used to refer to C2 (cost of production).“The government is deceiving the farmers by using a lower cost measure—A2+FL—and claiming that it is being given 50 per cent over and above the cost. For example, in 2021-22, the comprehensive C2 for wheat was Rs 1,467, which is 50 higher than Rs 960 mentioned by the government,” the unions said.They alleged without legal guarantee, the MSP declared by the government was of no value for most farmers as they were being forced to sell their crops below the support price.“Farmers will lose Rs 8 per quintal as hike in input cost is Rs 48 per quintal in comparison to the last season 2021-22 while hike in MSP is only Rs 40,” said agriculture expert Sudhir Panwar. He claimed that barley farmers would “lose Rs 13 per quintal” as input cost had risen by Rs 48 while MSP had been hiked by Rs 35.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/meagre-msp-hike-will-be-of-little-assistance-farm-unions-308573

The government has mandated Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen Bipin Rawat to create the theatre commands.The CDS has tasked the commander of the Indian Army’s South-Western command at Jaipur to set up the structures of the western theatre command that would look after the borders with the western neighbour.The existing area of the Army’s Northern Command has been kept out of theaterisation ambit. The IAF’s deployment in J&K and Ladakh will also not be altered. The full amalgamation of three armed forces into a “theatre command” would take at least two years, official sources said.“The thinking process is still on. The Jaipur-based Commander will come with the plan on which all units of the Army, IAF and the Navy will be integrated under the western theatre. Once that plan is ready and the structures are in place, a theatre commander will be appointed and be given the ‘operational command and control’ of the units which come under the western theatre. The existing ‘area commands’ of the Army, IAF and the Navy would cede their ‘operational powers’ to the theatre commander. Gradually, all roles of the existing commands will go to the theatre commander. The existing commands will function as advisory to the theatre commander,” sources added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/top-army-officer-tasked-to-lay-logistics-for-theatre-command-308577

However, such an extension of tenure of Director should be for a short period, it added.Petitioner Common Cause had filed a PIL seeking quashing the November 13 order issued by the Centre extending Mishra’s tenure as ED Director.Though there was no provision in the CVC Act for extension or reappointment of the ED Director, Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 enables the government to extend the tenure of Mishra, the top court noted. It said Mishra’s initial appointment could not be termed as illegal.“For all practical purposes, he should be treated as the Director till that particular date he was holding an office which is not below the rank of an Additional Secretary to the Government of India. Therefore, he was eligible for extension of tenure,” the top court said.HC defers plea on rakesh AsthanaThe Delhi High Court has deferred till September 16 hearing on a petition challenging the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner after the Centre sought time to file its response.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-upholds-tenure-extension-given-to-ed-director-mishra-308582

If the public transportation has to survive and compete with private players, they have to improve the system and their working culture. Citizens/passengers cannot be at the mercy of the authorities/administration. Somebody has to accept the responsibility,” a Bench led by Justice MR Shah said.“Therefore, unless and until the evidence is laid explaining the delay and it is established and proved that delay occurred beyond their control and/or even there was some justification for delay, the Railways are liable to pay the compensation for delay and late arrival of trains,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/railways-must-compensate-for-train-delays-says-sc-308583

09-09-2021||---||Can’t presume all Covid deaths during second wave were due to negligence: SC||New Delhi, September 8The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to entertain a petition which wanted all Covid-19 deaths during the second wave of the pandemic to be presumed as a result of medical negligence and compensation for the kin of those who died.“To assume that each death due to Covid-19 took place due to negligence is too much. The second wave had such an impact across the country that it cannot be presumed that all deaths happened due to negligence. Courts cannot have a presumption that all Covid deaths happened due to medical negligence, which your petition does,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said.It asked the petitioner Deepak Raj Singh to approach the competent authority with his suggestions.The Bench said it has already passed an order in June to the National Disaster Management Authority to recommend within six weeks appropriate guidelines for ex-gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of persons, who died due to Covid-19.“The government is yet to come out with the policy. If you have any suggestion with regard to implementation of that policy, you can approach the competent authority,” it said.The Bench also refused to pass a general order to the authorities for door-to-door vaccination, saying it was “not feasible”.“With one brush you want an order for the entire country. The vaccination drive is already in progress and over 60 per cent of the population has been administered the first dose,” the Bench told counsel for petitioner Youth Bar Association.Terming it a matter of governance, the Bench said it can’t scrap the existing policy.It sought to highlight the fact that the situation in Ladakh was different from that in Kerala, Uttar Pradesh or any other state. Similarly, in urban areas, the situation was different from that in rural areas, it said, adding “There are different kinds of problems in every state in this vast country.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-presume-all-covid-deaths-during-second-wave-were-due-to-negligence-sc-308449

The support price of mustard and rapeseed is up by around 8.6 percent (Rs 400) from Rs 4,650 per quintal last year to Rs 5,050 for 2022-23 and masur from Rs 5,100 to Rs 5,500 per quintal (7.8 per cent).According to officials, the cost of production of wheat is estimated at Rs 1,008 per quintal, of masur Rs 3,079 and mustard Rs 2,523. Therefore, in terms of return, wheat, rapeseed and mustard have got a “100 per cent increase” and masur “79 per cent” rise.“The differential remuneration is aimed at encouraging crop diversification,” officials said.“Expected returns to farmers over their cost of production are estimated to be highest in case of wheat and rapeseed and mustard (100% each), followed by lentil (79%), gram (74%), barley (60%) and safflower (50%),” they added.Wheat and mustard are the two major Rabi crops.The MSP of gram has been increased by Rs 130 to take it to Rs 5,230 per quintal in the upcoming season, barley by Rs 35 to take it to Rs 1,635 per quintal and safflower by Rs 114 to take it to Rs 5,441 per quintal. “Concerted efforts have made over the last few years to realign MSPs in favour of oilseeds, pulses and coarse cereals to encourage farmers shift to larger area under these crops and adopt best technologies and farm practices, to correct demand-supply imbalance,” they said.The production cost refers to comprehensive cost which includes all paid out costs such as those incurred on account of hired human labour, bullock labour/machine labour, rent paid for leased in land, expenses incurred on use of material inputs like seeds, fertilisers, manures, irrigation charges, depreciation on implements and farm buildings, interest on working capital, diesel/electricity for operation of pump sets etc., miscellaneous expenses and imputed value of family labour, according to the official definition.The decision was taken at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.MSP is the rate at which the government buys the grain from farmers.Currently, the government fixes MSPs for 23 crops grown in both Kharif and RabiThe sowing of Rabi (winter crops) begins from October  after the harvest of Kharif (summer crops).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-hikes-msp-of-wheat-by-rs-40-mustard-by-rs-400-308414

We will place a detailed affidavit," Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati told a Bench led by Justice SK Kaul, which had on August 18 asked the government to allow women candidates to appear for NDA entrance examination.Debarring women amounted to gender discrimination, the top court had said, even as it had clarified that the results would be subject to the final outcome of the petition. It had also directed the Union Public Service Commission to issue an appropriate notification taking into account its order and give it due publicity.Bhati said the decision was taken by the government after consultation with three service chiefs.The Centre, however, urged the court for an exemption from implementing the decision for this year's examination scheduled for November 14 as certain procedural and infrastructural changes would be needed.Appreciating the Centre's stand, the Bench said, "We have the nudged the authorities to take steps. The armed forces are respected branch in the country but for gender equality they need to do more. We are happy with the stand... Reforms can't happen in a day, we are also conscious."Terming it a historic and path-breaking decision, the Centre said it would lead to a generational reform.After recording the ASG’s statement, the Bench posted the matter for September 22.The decision will allow women to be inducted for permanent commission in the defence forces through the NDA and the Naval Academy.In its August 18 interim order, the court had wondered why the government was continuing in this direction even after its 2020 verdicts extending permanent commission in the Army and Navy to women.“If you are introducing women in the Army then why do you create a bar in NDA,” the Bench had told Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, adding that the government shouldn’t always invite judicial interventions.“This is unfounded now. We are finding it absurd. Will the Army act on after the judicial orders are passed? We will then pass an order, if that is what you want. I have this impression right from the High Court that till an order is passed, the Army does not believe in doing anything voluntarily,” the Bench had said.“It is not just a case of gender principle but it’s a case of discrimination”, the Bench had said, adding women officers were now admitted even in combat roles.The Centre should take a constructive view of the matter in view of the top court’s judgements, it had said.Petitioner Kush Kalra contended that denying women opportunity to be part of NDA violated their fundamental right to equality, right to non-discrimination and right to practise any occupation, trade business or profession guaranteed under the Constitution.Kalra had sought a direction to the authorities concerned to allow eligible female candidates to appear in the ‘National Defence Academy and Naval Academy Examination’ and train at the NDA in view of the 2020 landmark verdict granting Permanent Commission and command postings to women in the Army.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/women-cadets-allowed-into-nda-centre-tells-supreme-court-308386

The HAL is to make 83 Tejas Mark 1A and could be possibly the integrator in the future in the Advanced Medium combat Aircraft (AMCA) project.He said the success of the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) had redefined the core of aviation technology. It had generated the confidence to take on any project. “On the strength of LCA we can make everything like AMCA.”Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria, in his younger days, was a test pilot for the LCA programme.The challenge is from the northern borders (China) and the growing threat of an asymmetrical warfare. “Keep in mind that the new surprises we can spring on the adversary in the next conflict will be critical.
