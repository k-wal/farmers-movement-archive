I don’t want to ask the secret of his age and all that… So he said sorry sir! I don’t have any experience in law. Even though I am a law graduate I never practised.”“He said honestly sir you please guide us. You please tell (me) what’s the problem and all. I requested him the first problem is filling up the vacancies… and expedite the vacancies…this is the first priority. Then he immediately started working…he started sending all the files… thanks to him and he cleared at a jet speed. The nine names I think...six days’ time—record break...first time without any murmur… anything,” the CJI said during a function organised by the Bar Council of India to facilitate him.“I must thank the Honourable Prime Minister and the Law Minister and the Government of India for clearing the names. I expect with the same speed the other high court names also are cleared. In another one months’ time we expect to fill up at least 90 per cent of the vacancies filled in this country,” Justice Ramana said.He said, “With the young and dynamic gentleman Law Minister in office we can expect positive measures at rapid pace. The honourable Law Minister has mentioned that he does not have enough knowledge and wisdom. He has enough wisdom and knowledge and already we have seen his experience, his wisdom and knowledge… I am very happy to be a party to the decision making process with him. He is such a dynamic law Minister.”The Law Minister said when he met the CJI for the first time, he didn’t know him much and had heard about him only from friends and the media.“In our first interaction, I had realised that we have a CJI in whom we have full faith and trust…The Government will not only strengthen the independence of the judiciary but also provide support to the same,” Rijiju said in the presence of Supreme Court judges, some lawmakers and a large number of office-bearers of BCI and state bar councils.Rijiju also raised the issue of pendency of cases in subordinate courts. “When a person from a rural area expects justice, he sells off everything…like land, etc,…If justice gets delayed then it’s a big question mark on all of us…Denying justice beyond three years is a real delay and by that time justice isn’t even needed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-thought-hes-a-college-student-cji-on-first-meeting-with-law-minister-kiren-rijiju-306715
04-09-2021||Mumbai||No bail for actor Armaan Kohli in drug case||A court here on Saturday rejected the bail application of Bollywood actor Armaan Kohli, arrested in a drug seizure case.Kohli was arrested last Sunday following a raid by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) at his residence during which banned narcotics were allegedly seized.The actor had argued that only a small quantity of drugs was allegedly recovered from his possession, and as such he was entitled to bail.But special public prosecutor Advait Sethna opposed the application, claiming that he had direct links with the two prime accused in the case from whom a "commercial quantity" of contraband was recovered.Under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, offenses involving `commercial quantity' (which varies for different categories) attract higher punishment.The court rejected the bail pleas of Kohli and the two other accused arrested in the case.Kohli had featured in the Salman Khan-starter ‘Prem Ratan Dhan Payo’ among other Hindi films, and was also one of the contestants of TV reality show ‘Bigg Boss’. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-bail-for-actor-armaan-kohli-in-drug-case-306712

Both the girl and the boy hail from Uttar Pradesh, police said.A video of the incident also went viral on social media.The boy had reportedly run away with the 12-year-old girl from Balia in Uttar Pradesh and police in Dewas had been alerted to look out for them, said an official.A team of police personnel spotted them in a bus at Bhunsara toll booth, 17 km from Dewas city, said Sonkach area sub-divisional officer of police (SDOP) Prashant Singh Bhadoria.Just as the police was taking them away, over a dozen men, who were apparently following the bus in two cars, appeared on the spot and set upon the boy, he said.Th video showed several men slapping, hitting and punching the boy even as the policemen tried to stop them.The accused apparently thought that the boy was Muslim and had run away with a Hindu girl, said another police official. Both are in fact Hindu, he said. “They thought it was a case of ‘love jihad’. We were telling them that both were from the same community, but they didn’t listen,” he said, adding that if the boy had not been rescued by the police in time, he might not have survived.  ‘Love jihad’ is a term used by some right-wing leaders who claim that there is a ‘conspiracy’ to lure Hindu girls and convert them to Islam through marriage.The girl and the boy were taken to a safe place and later handed over to the Uttar Pradesh police, the SDOP said.On Friday, Dewas district police registered a case against four men who were identified from the video, and 15 other unidentified persons under IPC sections 353 (use of criminal force on any person with a public servant in the execution of his duty as such public servant), 147 (rioting), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 294 (use of obscene word).“We are trying to identify the other accused. As the charges against the accused are bailable and do not invite punishment of more than seven years, we are going to serve notice to them (before deciding on arrest),” SDOP Bhadoria said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/madhya-pradesh-minor-bashed-up-on-suspicion-of-love-jihad-306710
04-09-2021||New Delhi||Congress seeks SC-monitored probe into JEE exam paper leak||The Congress on Saturday demanded a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the alleged manipulation of JEE Mains examination after the CBI arrested seven persons in this connection.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the nation owes the hard-working students a fair JEE exam, but the government “is better at providing cover-ups”.“JEE (Main) Exam has been breached. Students appearing for such competitive exams prepare very hard, battling difficulties of various kinds. We, as a nation, owe them a fair exam. Government of India is better at providing cover-ups,” he said on Twitter.The opposition party also demanded answers from the BJP government, saying the Education Ministry and the National Testing Agency (NTA) are responsible for conducting examinations in a transparent manner and why they are not held accountable.The party’s students wing, NSUI, also announced protests across the country on Monday on the issue.The Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) is the national-level test held for admission in engineering courses.Addressing a joint press conference, Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh, Delhi Congress leader Alka Lamba and NSUI national president Neeraj Kundan said how can students be assured that such frauds have not happened in other exams conducted by the NTA.If one of the most prestigious entrance examinations of the country (JEE) is not spared by these frauds, then what is the quality of future professionals generated, they asked.“We demand an inquiry into the entire fraud under the supervision of a sitting Supreme Court judge as this is an issue related to the future of our country,” Vallabh told reporters.“Is it not the responsibility that the government should ensure that every student out of 22 lakh applicants who appeared for JEE Main exams 2021 to get a fair chance as their future is at stake,” he said.Citing the chronology of paper leaks, he mentioned Vyapam, SSC-2017, CBSE Class X and XII-2018, entrance exams in Haryana, JEE main 2020 and the latest case.“The only one thing that is common in all these examinations is that they have messed up the future of students of our country. The ‘Paper Leak Government’ is answerable to every youth of our country who is not able to get a deserving job or seat in a reputed institute due to endless paper leaks,” he said.Lamba alleged that paper leaks are happening under BJP governments and dubbed it as the “Bechte Jao Paper” party where the future of students and the country is at stake.She also demanded that the guilty be brought to book as fast as possible and a trial held in a fast-track court.Lamba also cited several alleged paper leaks in BJP-ruled Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Assam.She said students are under tremendous mental pressure when such reports of paper leak emerge and asked why the central government is “silent” on the issue.She alleged nothing has come out of the SSC paper leak incident in Delhi despite promises made in 2018.National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) president Neeraj Kundan claimed that paper leaks have been happening in recruitment tests in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh as well, but many paper leaks go unreported.Kundan said that to awaken this government, the NSUI will hold protests across the country on Monday to ensure that no one plays with the future of students.The CBI said it has arrested seven persons including two directors of a Noida-based private institution in connection with alleged manipulation of JEE Mains examination 2021.The CBI booked Affinity Education Pvt Ltd and its directors for “manipulating the online JEE (Mains) exam and facilitating aspiring students to get admission in top NITs in consideration of huge amount by solving the question paper of the applicant through remote access from a chosen examination centre in Sonepat(Haryana)”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-seeks-sc-monitored-probe-into-jee-exam-paper-leak-306707

The crime and the cover-up was carried out with expertise—this became clear as lot of chilly powder was put in the pit along with the body to distract sniffer dogs, experts said.After the body was located the police stopped digging and it was on Saturday morning they returned with forensic experts and the body was taken out.The Idukki police, which is overseeing the operations, said that the body will now be taken to the Kottayam Medical College for conducting an autopsy.Sindhu's relatives said that Binoy on August 10 took her youngest son who stayed with them to his relative's house and came back alone.On August 11, Sindhu reportedly called her daughter who lives with her father. She complained about being harassed by Binoy.And after that, there was no communication from Sindhu.On August 14, the youngest son returned to Binoy's house and found his mother missing and the message was passed on to her relatives, who the next day filed the missing complaint.Even though the police came, they did not give much significance to the statement of her young son, that the kitchen of the house was re-done and they left.However, things started to move faster, once Binoy went missing. The police decided to dig up the kitchen floor after her relatives raised more doubts.A man hunt is underway for Binoy.—     IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/missing-kerala-woman-found-6-feet-under-lovers-kitchen-306705

04-09-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi may visit the US in late September||A visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the US later this month is likely to depend on the finality over hosting of the first in-person summit of the Quad leaders by the Biden administration, people familiar with the development said on Saturday.The tentative schedule explored for the visit was between September 22-27 and the preparations were focused on three segments—Modi’s address at the UN General Assembly in New York, participation at the proposed Quad summit in Washington and a bilateral meeting with President Joe Biden, they said.However, the sudden decision by Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to step down by the end of September triggered uncertainty over the US hosting of the in-person Quad summit as Tokyo is learnt to have requested for a hybrid format for the talks.The people cited above said there was no final decision yet on the proposed visit to the US by Modi in view of the uncertainty over the holding of the Quad summit among the leaders of the US, India, Japan and Australia in Washington.Suga, who became prime minister of Japan a year ago after Shinzo Abe stepped down, announced on Friday that he will not seek re-election as leader of the Liberal Democrat Party (LDP) at the end of September.His announcement and the political turmoil in Tokyo have also thrown into doubt the holding of the in-person India-Japan summit for the third consecutive year.The annual summit between Modi and his then Japanese counterpart Abe was cancelled in December 2019 in Guwahati in the wake of massive protests rocking the Assam city over the amended citizenship law.In 2020, the summit could not be held due to the coronavirus pandemic.The people cited above said India and the US held a series of meetings as part of preparations for Modi’s visit to the US, which if it takes place, will be the first one after Biden took charge of the US in January.It is learnt that the issue figured during Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla’s recent meetings in Washington.The Biden administration has put cooperation with India a key aspect of its overall foreign policy priorities on the Indo-Pacific, a region that has witnessed growing Chinese military assertiveness.The US has been looking at convening the in-person summit of the leaders of Quad to boost practical cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region as well as to send a strong signal about Washington’s commitment to the grouping.In March, President Biden hosted the first-ever summit of the Quad leaders in the virtual format that vowed to strive for an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, inclusive, anchored by democratic values, and unconstrained by coercion, sending an apparent message to China.The last time Modi visited the US was in September 2019 when he and then US President Donald Trump addressed the Howdy Modi event in Houston.If Modi’s visit takes place, then it could signal a new phase in the two-way strategic engagement between India and the US.The Afghan crisis as well as developments in the Indo-Pacific region could be the major focus areas for discussion between the two sides. US Secretary of state Antony Blinken paid a two-day visit to India in July. Before that, US Defence Secretary Lloyd J Austin had paid a three-day visit to New Delhi in March.

04-09-2021||Ahmedabad||Union minister Athawale bats for one-child norm||Union social justice minister Ramdas Athawale on Saturday said his party supports one-child policy as the population growth in the country needs to be controlled for ensuring development.Asked about a recent remark of Gujarat deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel that people would be able to talk about Constitution and secularism only so long as Hindus are in majority, he said there was no possibility of Hindu population dwindling.“I do not think there is any question of Hindu population declining. Hindus remain Hindu and Muslims remain Muslim. Hardly one or two Hindus or Muslims convert. The Constitution gives people the right to do what they like, but nobody can force any person to covert,” Athawale said, speaking to reporters here.There would not be much change in the proportion of Hindus and Muslims in the population, he said, adding that “it is not the case that the population of Muslims has risen sharply in all these years”.“There is a need to control the population for the development of the country, irrespective of whether it is the population of Hindus or Muslims,” said the Union minister, who heads the Republican Party of India (Athawale group), a constituent of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).“If we adopt one family, one child (policy), we would be able to reduce population. For now we have ‘hum do, hamare do’....Our party’s stand is that to reduce population, there should be a law for ‘hum do, hamara ek, (one family, one child),” Athawale said.He will take up this issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he added.Nitin Patel had recently said at a public event that “those talking about the Constitution, laws, secularism will continue to talk only as long as Hindus are in majority in this country... (if) the number of Hindus decreases, and (number of) people of another religion increase, there will be no courts, Lok Sabha, Constitution, secularism, they will all vanish in thin air.”Asked about several instances of Dalits facing intimidation for sporting moustache or riding a horse being reported in Gujarat, Athawale, a prominent Dalit leader from Maharashtra, said he will raise the issue with Chief Minister Vijay Rupani.“It is true that the caste system continues to exist not only in Gujarat, but across the country. From the point of view of law it has ended, but it continues to exist in the minds of people,” he said.He will ask Rupani to take special measures for the protection of Dalits, he added.Athawale also opined that reservation should be for those whose annual income is below Rs 8 lakh.The BJP will win in four out of five states—Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Uttarakhand and Goa—where Assembly elections are due in coming months, the RPI chief said, making exception for Punjab where the saffron party’s alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal has ended.“RPI will support the BJP in all these four states,” he added.His ministry was working towards ending manual scavenging through a scheme to provide Rs 40,000 each to some 60,000 scavengers in the country, he informed.

04-09-2021||Mumbai||Pune plot case: Khadse, kin in fresh trouble after ED files chargesheet||There was fresh trouble for senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Eknath Khadse after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) filed a chargesheet in the Pune MIDC plot case, officials said here on Saturday.The ED has named Khadse, his wife Mandakini, son-in-law Girish Chaudhary, a former government sub-registrar Ravindra Muley and a realtor Benchmark Buildcon Pvt. Ltd., in the deal that was effected in 2016.Earlier in April 2017, the state Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) had lodged a case against Khadse following a complaint by an activist Hemant Gawande who claimed irregularities in the Bhosari MIDC land deal which led to a huge loss to the exchequer.The complainant contended that when Khadse was the Revenue Minister in the erstwhile Bharatiya Janata Party-led government, he had allegedly pressurized government officials to clear the land deal.While Khadse was forced to quit as minister in June 2016, a judicial commission headed by retired Justice Dinkar Zoting was set up to probe the matter.After the ACB case, the ED lodged a complaint and summoned Khadse and others in December 2020, while his son-in-law Chaudhary was arrested in July. The central agency also questioned other officials involved in the controversial transactions.The ED said that the land sale deed was executed in the name of Mandakini Khadse and Chaudhary at Rs 3.75 crore by the owner Abbas Aqani, and the amount was much lower than the prevailing market valuation of over Rs 31 crore.The transaction was intended to get compensation of thrice the market rate of the plot from the MIDC for which Khadse allegedly misused his powers as a minister.The ED probe also said that they allegedly used Benchmark Buildcon Pvt.

The government advocate informed the court that the investigating officer was not wearing uniform at the time of questioning students and submitted an affidavit.The Bench ordered the government to file a fresh affidavit on the progress of the departmental inquiry initiated by the government against the police officers. The matter was adjourned till October 21.The Bench also reminded the government of its directive given on August 16 to initiate measures to create awareness among police personnel on not violating the rights of children. The court had also asked the government to issue directives in this regard.The high court had also taken exception to violations of the guidelines of the Juvenile Justice Act by the police officers while investigating the sedition case against the Shaheen Group of Institutions of Bidar.On August 16, the other Division Bench then headed by the former Chief Justice A.S. Oka and Justice Sanjay Gowda, who took up the petition filed in this regard pulled up the government and state police department.“We have verified the affidavit submitted by DySP Basaveshwara in this regard on March 16. The attached photograph in the affidavit shows five police officers questioning two school boys and one school girl. Four police officers are seen in uniform and two of them had weapons. It is a serious prima facie violation of Juvenile Justice Act, Section 86 (5),” the bench observed.While interacting with children, police officers are advised to be clad in normal dress. Only woman officers should talk to girl students as per provisions of Juvenile Justice Act, the bench said.It also directed the government to submit an action taken report in this regard by one of the senior-most officers. The bench also told the government to consider initiating actions to prevent violations of children’s rights any further by framing guidelines for the state police officers and making them aware of it.“If we turn blind eye to this case, it will be repeated. We will not forgive this action by the police. Why should children be subjected to all this, it can’t continue,” the bench observed.Senior Advocate Nayana Jyothi Jhawar and South India Cell for Human Rights Education and Monitoring have filed a petition against the police department. They have alleged that, including a 9-year-old, 85 students were investigated  by the police which had left the children  traumatized .Shaheen Group of Institutions arranged a presentation on the controversial and ambitious project of the ruling BJP—the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at school premises in Bidar district of Karnataka last year.Neelesh Rakshala, an activist had filed a complaint alleging carrying out a negative campaign by the school management on a law enacted by parliament. The case was registered at Bidar New Town police station under sedition.  Including the headmistress, the student’s parents were arrested and later released on bail.The petition challenged the police action and said that the police violated all guidelines of CRPC, Juvenile Justice Act while investigating the case. They have also alleged that the police have recorded children’s videos without taking their consent.The petition demanded that the UN Guidelines of 2005 while inquiring about a criminal case should be considered. The petitioners have also demanded compensation for students and parents by the police.—     IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/year-on-probe-begins-against-cops-questioning-in-karnataka-school-sedition-case-306678

04-09-2021||New Delhi||Plea filed in Supreme Court seeking model police bill||A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking constitution of a 'model police bill' to make policing system "transparent, independent, accountable and people-friendly".The petition, filed by advocate and former Delhi BJP spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay, sought a direction to the Centre to constitute a 'judicial commission' or an expert committee to examine the Police Act of developed countries, particularly the US, Singapore and France and draft the 'model police bill'.The PIL, which is likely to come up for hearing in the coming days, also urged the court to direct the Law Commission of India to examine police acts of these countries for drafting the bill in order to make the police system "efficient, effective, transparent, sensible, accountable and techno-savvy, and to secure 'rule of law' and right to life, liberty and dignity of citizens".The petition, filed by advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey, alleged that the 1990 Kashmir killings did not happen only in the dark of the night but in broad daylight as well "because what we have is the ruler's police not the people's police".“What happened in 1990 in Kashmir, it happened in 2021 in Bengal as well and that too in broad daylight. But police did nothing as what we have is ruler's police, not people's police," it claimed.The 'Colonial Police Act, 1861' is ineffective, outdated, cumbersome, and has completely failed to secure rule of law, right to life, liberty, dignity and other precious fundamental rights of citizens but the executive did nothing to amend it, the petitioner said.The PIL further alleged that many times, police don't lodge FIRs without the consent of MLAs or MPs of the ruling party."And even if they lodge an FIR on the court's order, the ruling party representatives decide what sections should be used against the accused," it said.It further said that politicisation of the police is the biggest threat to rule of law and right to life, liberty and dignity of citizens.

So our argument in the present case is that firearms were used to murder Dr Dabholkar to strike terror among a section of people, here a group of people, that is members of the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti (founded by Dabholkar), so section 16 of UAPA is attracted in the case," he said.He added that the CBI had received sanction from the state government to invoke section 16 of the UAPA.Defence counsel Virendra Ichalkaranjikar, however, opposed the prosecution's demand to invoke section 16 of the UAPA.After hearing arguments from both the sides, the court posted the matter for September 7.Dabholkar, a well-known anti-superstition crusader, was shot dead in Pune on August 20, 2013.

04-09-2021||Bengaluru||ISRO-IISc team develops modular device for extra-terrestrial experiments||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) have developed a modular, self-contained device to cultivate microorganisms, which could enable scientists to carry out biological experiments in outer space.In a study published in 'Acta Astronautica', the team showed how the device can be used to activate and track the growth of a bacterium called 'Sporosarcina pasteurii ' over several days, with minimal human involvement, Bengaluru-based IISc said in a statement.Understanding how such microbes behave in extreme environments could provide valuable insights for human space missions such as 'Gaganyaan', India's first crewed spacecraft planned by ISRO, it said.In recent years, scientists have been increasingly exploring the use of lab-on-chip platforms  which combine many analyses into a single integrated chip for such experiments. But there are additional challenges to designing such platforms for outer space, when compared to the lab.“It has to be completely self-contained,” said Koushik Viswanathan, Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and a senior author of the study. "Besides, you can't simply expect the same operating conditions as you would in a normal laboratory setting...and you can't have something that guzzles 500W, for example."  The device developed by the IISc and ISRO team uses a LED and photodiode sensor combination to track bacterial growth by measuring the optical density or scattering of light, similar to spectrophotometers used in the lab.It also has separate compartments for different experiments. Each compartment or 'cassette' consists of a chamber where bacteria suspended as spores in a sucrose solution ? and a nutrient medium can be mixed to kickstart growth, by flicking on a switch remotely.Data from each cassette is collected and stored independently. Three cassettes are clubbed into a single cartridge, which consumes just under one W of power. The researchers envision that a full payload that could go in a spacecraft will contain four such cartridges capable of carrying out 12 independent experiments.The team also had to ensure that the device was leak-proof and unaffected by any change in orientation.“This is a non-traditional environment for the bacteria to grow. It is totally sealed and has a very small volume. We had to see whether we would get consistent (growth) results in this smaller volume,” said Aloke Kumar, Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and another senior author. “We also had to make sure that the LED going on and off doesn't generate much heat, which can change the bacterial growth characteristics.” Using an electron microscope, the researchers were able to confirm that the spores grew and multiplied into rod-shaped bacteria inside the device, as they would have under normal conditions in the lab, according to the statement.“Now that we know this proof-of-concept works, we have already embarked on the next step getting a flight model (of the device) ready,” Viswanathan said. This would include optimising the physical space that the device can take up and its performance under stresses such as vibration and acceleration due to gravity.The device can also be adapted for studying other organisms such as worms, and for non-biological experiments.“The whole idea was to develop a model platform for Indian researchers. Now that ISRO is embarking on an ambitious human space mission, it has to come up with its own solutions, made at home," Kumar said.

However, no retired SC judge could be immediately found for assigning the job. As a result, the work of monitoring the SIT probe was entrusted to Chellur.In its order on Friday, the five-judge Bench of the High Court led by Acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal said Chellur was offered the job “on account of immediate non-availability of a retired Supreme Court Judge to take up the assignment”. The court asked the state government to pay Chellur Rs 10 lakh for the work. In addition, arrangements would have to be made for her travel and stay befitting a Chief Justice.

High tobacco use, imbalanced diets and sedentary lifestyles are primarily fuelling the CVD burden among Indians. The risk of heart attacks is four to five times higher for smokers than for non-smokers,” Prabhakaran said. Researchers attributed part of the CVD disease burden in India to high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes and obesity and suggested screening for risk factors at least once every five years after a person turns 30.Primary prevention is another way to prevent sudden death. In the US, one-half, and at times more, of the decline in coronary heart disease mortality has been attributed to successes in primary prevention.“Treatment of risk factors to prevent CVD is suboptimal in India. For example, the use of therapies to treat hypertension in India is alarmingly low compared with the developed economies. Among those diagnosed with hypertension in rural and urban areas of India, the proportions receiving treatment are 24.9 per cent and 37.6 per cent, respectively, whereas 77 per cent of individuals with hypertension in the US are taking at least one BP drug.Deaths upTop contributing factors||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dietary-habits-fuelling-heart-risks-in-youth-306300

Justice Subramonium Prasad, in five separate verdicts, granted bail to accused Mohd Arif, Shadab Ahmad, Furkan, Suvaleen and Tabassum, who are facing prosecution for the murder of Delhi Police head constable Ratan Lal during the north-east Delhi riots in 2020.‘Bail is the rule’The court must hesitate before arriving at a conclusion that every member of unlawful assembly inhabits a common intention to accomplish the unlawful common object… Bail is the rule and jail is the exception. Justice Subramonium Prasad, Delhi HC The HC said while definitiveness and veracity of the statements of public witnesses and police officials was not to be delved into at this juncture and was a matter of trial, the court was of the opinion that the same was not sufficient to justify continued incarceration.The court said the issue that arose for consideration was whether when an offence of murder was committed by an unlawful assembly, should each person in that assembly be denied the benefit of bail, regardless of their role. It said, “When there is a crowd involved, at the juncture of grant or denial of bail, the court must hesitate before arriving at the conclusion that every member of the unlawful assembly inhabits a common intention to accomplish the unlawful common object.” — PTIAlso read: Chargesheet reads like web series, says Umar Khalid||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-incarcerate-for-protest-hc-grants-bail-to-5-in-delhi-riots-case-306254

It was funded by the National Mission on Himalayan Studies, GB Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment and Sustainable Development, Almora. Dr Nivedita Sharma, professor and head, Department of Basic Sciences, was the principal investigator of the project, sanctioned in 2018. She was being supported by Dr Nisha Sharma, research associate.Dr Ravinder Sharma, Director, Research, said, “The scientists are employing micro-organisms to break down pine needles into ethanol, which has gained importance as a substitute for fossil fuels like petroleum. Ethanol is made from food items like sugarcane, rice, etc. In this project, the work is being done on making ethanol using organic waste. “Dr Parvinder Kaushal, Vice-Chancellor, said, “So far, in this project, the work has been accomplished to produce fuel-grade ethanol from the unutilised forest waste by devising a novel technology, which includes employing novel specialised microbes to solubilise resistant pine needles and subsequently standardisation of fermentation to ethanol.“With the Government of India aiming to switch to 20 per cent ethanol blending in petrol by 2025, the technique to produce biofuel is likely to be in demand. The Himachal Government has also decided to set up an ethanol plant in the state,” said the VC.“This project will lead to eco-friendly management of pine needles. It will not only help in proper disposal of the organic waste, but also contribute to ensuring food security as the dependence on food items for making ethanol will be reduced,” added Dr Kaushal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biofuel-from-pine-needles-a-reality-306252

04-09-2021||New Delhi||Panjshir captured, say Taliban sources||Taliban sources said the Islamist militia had on Friday seized the Panjshir valley, the last part of Afghanistan holding out against it. It was not immediately possible to confirm the reports.Former Vice-President Amrullah Saleh, one of the leaders of the opposition forces known as Resistance-2, denied the reports in a video clip. “There is no doubt we are in a difficult situation. We are under invasion by the Taliban... We have held the ground, we have resisted,” he said. Earlier in the day, the Taliban began an economic blockade of Panjshir valley amid sporadic clashes with the National Resistance Front even as formation of a Central government in Kabul entered the final stages.One of the main entrance routes to Panjshir was blocked with containers and only locals of the neighbouring district were permitted movement, said Amrullah Saleh, one of the resistance leaders. However, there are many mountain trails that have been used by late Ahmad Shah Masoud’s guerrillas in the past to expand resistance to neighbouring districts.The National Resistance Front, which also calls itself Resistance-2, said Talibanhave blocked humanitarian access to the valley and were using military age Tajik civilians as mine clearance tools. For the second day, both sides claimed heavy casualties without credible authentication but the indication was of sporadic clashes as the Taliban made probing attempts into a gorge bounded by steep mountains.Meanwhile, Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla met Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman in Washington on Thursday to discuss continued coordination on Afghanistan.A Taliban spokesmen Suhail Shaheen was quoted as saying that the group would raise its demand for Muslims in Kashmir and seek their equal treatment under India’s laws. But men higher to him in hierarchy, Sher Mohammed Stanikzai and Anas Haqqani, have spoken of an amicable relationship with India with the latter specifically stating that “Kashmir is not part of our jurisdiction and interference is against the policy”.With the Rehbar Shura (Leadership Council) ending three-days of discussions in the Taliban spiritual heartland Kandahar, there is “no doubt” about Haibutullah Akhundzada as the leader of the government, said Taliban leader Anamullah Samangani.The local media is suggesting Akhundzada will be the spiritual head and President and his deputy Mullah Baradar will be the head of government as PM. There have been no public discussions on this aspect or on the country’s name and national flag. The Taliban has already unilaterally appointed governors, police chiefs and police commanders for provinces and districts. — TNS/Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/panjshir-captured-say-taliban-sources-306209

We have already extended the time once. By the time you (the govt) frame the guidelines, the third phase will also be over.” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed the court that everything was under consideration.Petitioner advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal pointed out that the court had already granted four-week extension to the Centre on August 16 to frame guidelines for ex gratia and now it was seeking more time. The first direction in that regard was passed on June 30 and the extended time was scheduled to end on September 8.On the issue of compensation, the court said it’s for the Centre to take a decision within this period as it adjourned the hearing to September 13 for compliance of other directions.On the issue of offline exams in Kerala, a Bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Hrishikesh Roy and CT Ravikumar said, “Prima facie we find force in submission made by petitioner that the state government has not seriously considered the prevailing situation before having a physical exam proposed to be conducted in September this year.”“As we couldn’t get a satisfactory response from counsel for the state in this regard, we grant interim relief staying the offline exam till next date of hearing (September 13),” the court said.Counsel for the Kerala Government tried to convince the court saying the exams would be held by taking all requisite safety measures and adhering to Covid-19 protocol, but the Bench wasn’t convinced.1st order on June 30Kerala leads surge45,352 fresh casesTOTAL DEATHS: 4,39,895ACTIVE CASES: 3,99,778366 deaths in 24 hours||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/frame-norms-for-covid-death-certificate-by-september-11-says-supreme-court-306164
04-09-2021||New Delhi||After dropping below one, Covid R-value rises sharply to 1.17 in second half of August||The R-value which reflects how rapidly coronavirus pandemic is spreading, has sharply risen close to 1.2 over the last fortnight, mainly driven by cases in states like Kerala and Maharashtra, say researchers.The R-value calculated between August 24-29 stood at 1.17 as against 0.89 between August 14-17, according to the researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai.The rise in the R-value comes after a steady decline in cases in the first half of August in the country.“Up to that date (August 30), the situation looked pretty bad. India’s R-value had shot up close to 1.2. Not only is it greater than one, it is much higher than the last time there was a scare of a third wave (it was 1.03 at that time).“This is driven by several states having their R-value go over 1 in the last few days of August—most notably Kerala and Maharashtra, but also Mizoram and Jammu and Kashmir,” Sitabhra Sinha, who is leading the team of researchers at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Chennai, told PTI.The R-value of Kerala stood at 1.33, which is the highest number of active cases in the country. Similarly, the R-value of Mizoram was 1.36, Jammu and Kashmir (1.25), Maharashtra (1.06) and Andhra Pradesh (1.09).The Reproduction number or R refers to how many people an infected person infects, on average. In other words, it tells how ‘efficiently’ a virus is spreading.A smaller R indicates the disease is on a decline. Conversely, if R is greater than 1, the number of infected people is increasing in each round—this is what is called the epidemic phase.After the devastating second wave that saw hospitals and health infrastructure being overwhelmed by patients infected by SARS-CoV2 coronavirus, the R-value started to decline.During the March-May period, thousands of people died due to the infection while lakhs were infected.When the second wave swept through the country between March to May, the R-value was 1.37 (between March 9 to April 21).From May 15-June 26, the R-value stood at 0.78. However, it slowly started increasing—it was 0.88 from June 20-July 7, 0.95 from July 3-22, 0.96 from July 24-27.It breached the value of 1.03 for the first time after the second wave during July 27-31. However, since then it has slowly started to decline.The R-value was 0.92 from August 6-9, and rose to 0.99 between August 12-14. But it slipped to 0.89 between August 14-17.With 45,352 people testing positive for coronavirus, India’s total tally of Covid-19 cases rose to 3,29,03,289, while active cases registered an increase for the third consecutive day, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Friday.‘The active cases increased to 3,99,778, comprising 1.22 per cent of the total infections, while the national Covid-19 recovery rate was recorded at 97.45 per cent, the ministry said.An increase of 10,195 cases has been recorded in the active Covid-19 caseload in a span of 24 hours.A total of 67.09 crore vaccine doses have been administered so far under the nationwide vaccination drive.India’s Covid-19 tally had crossed the 20 lakh-mark on August 7, 2020, 30 lakh on August 23, 40 lakh on September 5, and 50 lakh on September 16. It went past 60 lakh on September 28, 70 lakh on October 11, 80 lakh on October 29, 90 lakh on November 20 and surpassed the one crore-mark on December 19.India crossed the grim milestone of two crore on May 4 this year and three crore on June 23.

The tunnel was discovered in 2016,” Goel told PTI.He said the historical significance of the tunnel is yet to be established but it is conjectured that the tunnel connects the Legislative Assembly to the Red Fort.“We are not going to renovate the tunnel or dig it further as it will not be possible because lots of construction activities such as Metro Rail would have blocked its way. We will keep it as it is and allow the public to see it,” Goel said.He said the work on the project of renovation of the execution room had already started.“Tenders have been floated and the PWD would soon begin its work. The design on which the execution room will be renovated have also been prepared,” Goel said.The building was built in 1911. The Delhi Assembly was used as Central Legislative Assembly after the capital of the country was shifted to Delhi from Kolkata in 1912.The distance between Delhi Assembly and the Red Fort is about 5-6 km.The Red Fort was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the mid-17th century.

His medical condition was stable and was improving, it noted.However, it clarified that if medical authorities considered it necessary to shift him to Medanta for further treatment, they might do so.Kumar (75) has sought interim bail citing his poor health condition and the top court had on August 24 asked the CBI to verify the medical condition.Kumar - who had sought interim bail on the grounds of his poor health condition - has been in jail since December 31, 2018 when he surrendered after being convicted and awarded life imprisonment by the Delhi High Court in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.He has challenged the Delhi High Court's verdict of December 17, 2018 that awarded him life imprisonment for the "remainder of his natural life".The case relates to the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment's Raj Nagar Part-I area of southwest Delhi on November 1-2 in 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.Senior advocate Vikas Singh had submitted on behalf of the convict that he should be taken to a private hospital for treatment as his condition had not been determined at a government hospital here.“We want somebody from the state to verify it. We want the state to verify what the medical condition is,” the Bench had said, posting the matter for September 6. Later, the hearing was advanced to September 3.The Supreme Court on September 4 last year had dismissed Kumar’s interim bail plea, saying "This is not a small case...We cannot grant you bail.”It had also declined his plea for hospitalisation, saying his medical reports suggested he didn’t need to be sent to a hospital.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-refuses-interim-bail-on-health-grounds-to-sajjan-kumar-in-1984-anti-sikh-riots-case-305966
