He will have a one-year tenure as Delhi Police chief.The Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) — which has challenged Asthana’s appointment as the Delhi Police Commissioner before the Supreme Court – had earlier alleged that Alam’s petition was mala fide and a complete copy-paste of the NGO’s petition before the top court.The Supreme Court had on August 25 asked the Delhi High Court to decide in two weeks the petition challenging Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police Commissioner.The top court said, “If the petitioner (CPIL) wants to file any intervention application in the matter pending before the High Court and/or to assist the said court, it would be at liberty to do so,” a Bench led by CJI NV Ramana had said.CPIL had on August 6 moved the Supreme Court against the appointment of Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner on the ground that the decision went against the court’s ruling on such appointments.Advocate ML Sharma had also filed a similar petition in the top court seeking contempt action against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for allegedly violating the court’s order in appointing Asthana as Delhi Police chief.Thereafter, a separate petition was filed in the Delhi High Court against Asthana’s appointment as the Delhi Police chief.The CPIL petition alleged that just four days before Asthana was due to superannuate on July 31, 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted him an inter-cadre transfer from his parent cadre of Gujarat to the Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram other Union Territories including Delhi Cadre and gave him an extension of service for one year and appointed him as Delhi Police Commissioner.The NGO alleged that both the orders passed by the central government and ACC on July 27 were “completely illegal” as they violated the top court’s directions in Prakash Singh’s case (2006) on police reforms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/challenge-to-asthanas-appointment-as-delhi-police-chief-hc-gives-more-time-to-govt-to-respond-308461

Nationalist viewpoint is gaining ground over forces inimical to India, but the war would go on for a long time,” he said.Panchjanya and Organiser are published by Bharat Prakashan and it is believed that both weeklies reflect the ideological views of the Sangh.“Panchjanya and Organiser have been raising issues of national interest and that is what they are known for,” Panchjanya editor Hitesh Shankar said.Panchjanya had, in its issue this month, slammed Infosys for glitches in the Income Tax and GST portals developed by the software firm and wondered whether any anti-national force via Infosys is trying to hurt India’s economic interests.The magazine had a four-page cover story on Infosys, ‘Saakh Aur Aghaat’ (Reputation and Damage), with a picture of its founder Narayana Murthy. The article attacked the Bengaluru-based company and dubbed it as ‘Unchi Dukan, Phika Pakwaan’ (great cry and little wool).The article had drawn flak from the opposition parties which alleged that it was “Sangh’s coordinated attack on India’s prized corporates”.However, Ambekar later clarified Sangh’s stand.“As an Indian company, Infosys has made a seminal contribution to the progress of the country. There might be certain issues with a portal run by Infosys, but the article published by Panchjanya in this context only reflects the individual opinion of the author.“Panchjanya is not a mouthpiece of the RSS and the said article or opinions expressed in it should not be linked with the RSS,” he had tweeted.

If the public transportation has to survive and compete with private players, they have to improve the system and their working culture. Citizens/passengers cannot be at the mercy of the authorities/administration. Somebody has to accept the responsibility,” a Bench led by Justice MR Shah said.“Therefore, unless and until the evidence is laid explaining the delay and it is established and proved that delay occurred beyond their control and/or even there was some justification for delay, the railways are liable to pay the compensation for delay and late arrival of trains,” it said in its September 6 order.“It cannot be disputed that every passenger’s time is precious and they might have booked the tickets for further journeys, like in the present case from Jammu to Srinagar and thereafter further journey,” it said.The top court dismissed the appeal filed by the Railways challenging an order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which had upheld orders passed by the Rajasthan State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and the District Forum, Alwar holding North Western Railway liable for deficiency in service.The consumer courts had asked the North Western Railway to pay the aggrieved passenger Rs 15,000 for taxi expenses, Rs 10,000 towards booking expenses and Rs 5,000 each towards mental agony and litigation expenses.Petitioner Sanjay Shukla had contended that due to delay in the arrival of the Ajmer Jammu Express Train by four hours, he and three members of his family missed the connecting flight booked by him from Jammu to Srinagar, which was to take off at 12 noon, forcing them to travel to Srinagar by taxi. He suffered a loss of Rs 9,000 as air fare and had to pay Rs 15,000 towards taxi hire charges. He also suffered a loss of Rs 10,000 on account of booking a boat in Dal Lake in 2016.The railways had never explained why the train was delayed at Jammu, the top court noted.The Railways had contended that late running of trains can’t be termed as deficiency in service. Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati cited Rule 114 and Rule 115 of the Indian Railway Conference Association Coaching Tariff, according to which the Railways weren’t liable to pay compensation for late running of trains.However, the top court rejected the arguments, saying, “No evidence at all was led by the Railways explaining the delay and/or late arrival of trains at Jammu. The railways were required to lead the evidence and explain the late arrival of trains to establish and prove that delay occurred because of reasons beyond their control. At least the Railways were required to explain the delay, which they failed.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/railways-must-compensate-passengers-for-train-delays-sc-308454

Police said two to three persons were injured but their political affiliation was not known.According to sources, CPI(M) party offices in Agartala, Bishalgarh and Kathalia, were also vandalized and set on fire, after the Udaipur clash.The clashes follow an earlier round of violence on Monday between workers of the two parties, when former Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar was allegedly prevented from proceeding to Dhanpur.Police said the injured BJP activist from Udaipur, who was in a critical condition, was shifted to G.B Pant hospital in Agartala.A large contingent of police had to be deployed to disperse the mob and avoid further rioting. Officers also said a group of unidentified miscreants also vandalized CPI(M)'s Udaipur party office, while a vehicle belonging to the former Left Front Minister Ratan Bhowmick was set ablaze.Agriculture minister Pranajit Singha Roy rushed to the spot soon after the clash and took stock of the situation.Later speaking to the media, the minister said that the youth wing of the CPI(M) had brought out a rally without seeking prior permission from police.“When police tried to stop the CPI(M) rally, they indulged in violence, injuring several people. A BJP activist- Mofiz Miah, who was passing by, was attacked and critically injured. Besides, a hotel was vandalized and some houses were ransacked,” Singha Roy told the media.He said the government would take legal action against those involved in the violence.Meanwhile, Union Minister of State Pratima Bhowmik led a protest march at Dhanpur in Sonamura sub-division protesting Monday's violence.Later in the evening, BJP Sadar district unit also held a protest rally in the capital city- Agartala.

This means that in real terms, MSP has been reduced by 4%. The new MSP of Rs 2015 for wheat is equivalent to Rs 1,901 when adjusted for inflation,” they said, also accusing the government of “misusing” the term “Comprehensive Costs” used to refer to C2 Cost of Production.“The government is blatantly deceiving the farmers and nation by using a lower cost measure A2+FL and claiming that it is giving 50% above the cost. For example, in 2021-22, the comprehensive C2 cost of production for wheat was Rs 1,467 which is 50% higher than the lower cost of Rs 960 used by the government,” farmers unions said, “rejecting” the government’s “play with numbers while demanding “real profits not imaginary profits”.They also said without a legal guarantee, the MSP declared by the government is of no value for most farmers because they are still having to sell their crops below the support price.Also according to agriculture expert Sudhir Panwar, the Rabi MSP for 2022-23 “will hardly achieve its declared objective, which is an increase in farmers income and crop diversification”.“Farmers will lose Rs 8 per quintal as increases in input cost is Rs 48 per quintal in comparison to the last season 2021-22 while hike in MSP is only Rs 40,” he said, claiming that barley’ farmers “will also lose Rs 13 per quintal because input cost has increased by Rs 48 while increase in MSP is only Rs 35”.“Considering the factor of increase in input cost, the effective hike in MSP of lentil is Rs 185, Mustard Rs 290 and Safflower Rs 36 per quintal,” he said.“The other objective diversification of crops is not visible as returns in wheat and mustard are the same, that is 100 per cent while in pulses, which needs encouragement, it is lesser than wheat. For lentil it is 79 per cent, gram 74 per cent, safflower 50 per cent and barley 60 per cent only,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rabi-msp-farmers-unions-reject-govts-play-with-numbers-seek-real-not-imaginary-profits-308434

His wife Tazeen Fatima is the secretary and son Abdullah Azam Khan is an active member of the Trust.Both Azam Khan and Abdullah are currently lodged at Sitapur district jail and are facing several cases.Citing the SDM’s report, the court said a mosque was constructed over the land which was only for educational purposes. Thus, it is a violation of the permission granted by the state government.The court said that no interference was required in the order passed by the ADM to initiate proceedings under Section 104/105 of the UP Revenue Code, 2006 for vesting of University’s land in UP Government i.e. taking over the land given to the Trust.The court said, “It is a case where a large part of the land has been purchased as well as a certain part of the land belonging to tenure holders and Gram Sabha has been encroached upon by a former Cabinet Minister of the state for establishing an educational institution pursuant to an Act which has come up in the year 2005”.            “The finding has not been assailed by placing documentary proof that the plots in question were purchased by the Trust and does not belong to Gram Sabha or the tenure holders who have initiated proceedings under Section 134 of the Code,” the court said.In 2005, the then Samajwadi Party government enacted the Mohammad Ali Jauhar University Act, paving the way for the creation of the university.Thereafter, the state government granted permission to the Trust to acquire 400 acres of land against the ceiling of 12.5 acres (5.0586 hectares) for the establishment of the University while imposing certain conditions, one of which was that the land will be used only for educational purposes.According to law, if such a condition is violated, the permission granted by the state government stands withdrawn. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/allahabad-hc-dismisses-petition-against-proceeding-to-take-over-land-of-azam-khans-jauhar-university-308419

We will protect you in the interim,” said the bench, also comprising justices BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna.“We cannot create a separate avenue for journalists to directly come to this court under Article 32 for quashing of FIRs,” the bench observed.The top court said it understands the importance of right of free speech and “doesn’t want freedom of press to be muzzled”.The apex court told the counsel appearing for the petitioners that it will grant protection and they can approach the high court on the issue.The plea was filed by Foundation for Independent Journalism and three journalists—Seraj Ali, Mukul Singh Chauhan and Ismat Ara—who have sought quashing of three FIRs lodged against them at Rampur, Ghaziabad and Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh as well as the proceedings arising out of them.The petition, filed through advocate Shadan Farasat, said these FIRs have been filed solely on account of journalistic reporting of various events and occurrences of public relevance.It said FIR at Rampur was lodged in January this year while the other two FIRs were registered in June.“No part of the matter published is even remotely an offence, although it may be unpalatable to the government or some people,” it said, adding that FIRs have been lodged against the portal and its scribes in Uttar Pradesh.The plea said that FIR lodged in Barabanki was in connection with a news story on the demolition of a mosque in the area in May 2021 by the police on the orders of the district administration.“A news story is entitled to record and convey the aspirations, anguish, and perspective of the people, even if these are not in accord with the thinking of the State or its agents. This is precisely what the media in a democratic country is meant to do,” it said.Besides seeking quashing of the three FIRs, the plea had also sought a direction restraining UP Police from taking any coercive action against the petitioners in connection with these cases.It had also urged the apex court to lay down guidelines to prevent the alleged misuse of Indian Penal Code provisions, including sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race etc) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief), particularly against media houses and journalists exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech and expression while reporting.                            The plea said it is not for the police to “sit in judgment” over the media for its reports.“The media is meant to ventilate the problems of ordinary people, the nature and effect of administrative policy, and differing world views,” it said.It alleged that relevant IPC provisions, which deals with actual offences against communal harmony, are presently being “subverted and misused” and used to “gag any media reportage” on incidents that may have a communal, religious or political angle.It said role of media reflects the citizen’s right to know and ensure accountability in governance and if this routine duty becomes easily vulnerable to criminal process, democratic institutions will suffer.“The petitioners also pray for appropriate guidelines to prevent this manner of use of the criminal process, which has a chilling effect on media freedoms and the right of the people to be informed,” it said.The plea has also referred to the May 31 order of the apex court which had granted protection to two news channels that were booked under the sedition law.“We are of the view that the ambit and parameters of the provisions of sections 124A (sedition), 153A and 505 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 would require interpretation, particularly in the context of the right of the electronic and print media to communicate news, information and the rights, even those that may be critical of the prevailing regime in any part of the nation,” the apex court had said in its May 31 order. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-create-separate-avenue-for-scribes-to-come-directly-to-apex-court-for-quashing-of-firs-sc-308412
08-09-2021||Aditi Tandon||Spread of Delta driven by combination of immune escape, increased infectivity: Nature||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 8The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, which has become the dominant variant in countries, including India and the UK, has most likely spread through its ability to evade neutralising antibodies and its increased infectivity, say an international team of researchers including from India.The findings have just been reported in the leading science journal Nature.Prof Ravi Gupta from the Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease at the University of Cambridge, one of the study’s senior authors, said: “We have shown that the Delta variant is better at replicating and spreading than other commonly-observed variants. There’s also evidence that neutralising antibodies produced as a result of previous infection or vaccination are less effective at stopping this variant.“These factors are likely to have contributed to the devastating epidemic wave in India during the first quarter of 2021, whereas many as half of the cases were individuals who had previously been infected with an earlier variant.”To examine how well the Delta variant was able to evade the immune response, the team extracted serum from blood samples collected as part of the Covid cohort of the NIHR BioResource. The samples came from individuals who had previously been infected with the coronavirus or who had been vaccinated with either the Oxford/AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines. Serum contains antibodies raised in response to infection or vaccination. The team found that the Delta variant virus was 5.7-fold less sensitive to the sera from previously-infected individuals, and as much as eight-fold less sensitive to vaccine sera, compared with the Alpha variant - in other words, it takes eight times as many antibodies from a vaccinated individual to block the virus.Consistent with this, an analysis of over 100 infected health care workers at three Delhi hospitals, nearly all of whom had been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, found the Delta variant to be transmitted between vaccinated staff to a greater extent than the alpha variant.Professor Anurag Agrawal from the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi, joint senior author, added: “Infection of vaccinated health care workers with the Delta variant is a significant problem. Although they themselves may only experience mild Covid, they risk infecting individuals who have suboptimal immune responses to vaccination due to underlying health conditions – and these patients could then be at risk of severe disease. We urgently need to consider ways of boosting vaccine responses against variants among health care workers. It also suggests infection control measures will need to continue in the post-vaccine era.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/spread-of-delta-driven-by-combination-of-immune-escape-increased-infectivity-nature-308405

We are checking CCTV footages and talking to eyewitnesses and locals.  No arrest has been made thus far," he said.This morning, bombs were hurled at my home.

08-09-2021||New Delhi||Courts can't presume that all Covid deaths during second wave were due to negligence: SC||The Supreme Court on Wednesday said that courts cannot presume that all deaths due to Covid in the second wave of the pandemic were due to negligence as it refused to entertain a plea seeking compensation for the kin of the victims by treating it as medical negligence.Also read: Why herd immunity is elusive despite vaxA bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli asked the petitioner Deepak Raj Singh to approach the competent authorities with his suggestions.The bench said, “To assume that each death due to Covid took place due to negligence is too much. The second wave had such an impact across the country that it cannot be presumed that all deaths happened due to negligence. Courts cannot have a presumption that all Covid deaths happened due to medical negligence, which your petition does.”The top court referred to a recent verdict of June 30, in which it had directed the National Disaster Management Authority to recommend within six weeks appropriate guidelines for ex-gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of persons, who died due to Covid.It said, “In that verdict the court has taken a view with regard to humanity and not due to negligence. The government is yet to come out with the policy. If you have any suggestion with regard to implementation of that policy, you can approach the competent authority.”At the outset, advocate Sriram Parakat, appearing for the petitioner, said that his petition is different as it brings into account an element of negligence and compensation for the deaths which have happened due to medical negligence.The bench noted that since the petition was filed in May, a lot of developments had taken place.“We have taken suo motu cognizance on Covid preparedness and a National Task Force has been constituted by this court which is looking into several aspects,” the bench said. The bench further told Parakat, “It was such a wave that it affected the entire country” and the court could not make a general presumption of medical negligence.The top court, while disposing of the petition, asked the petitioner to withdraw his plea and amend it and if any suggestions are there, then the petitioner could approach the competent authority.

08-09-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury                                                                                             ||Bihar opposition parties want Ram Vilas Paswan’s Delhi bungalow converted into a memorial||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 8Trying to fish in troubled waters, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has said that late Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan’s official bungalow at 12 Janpath, where the Dalit politician lived for more than three decades, be turned into a memorial.“It has not even been a year since Ram Vilas Paswan passed away and the BJP-JD(U) is trying to insult him. The BJP-JD(U) first broke up the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and is now trying to get the bungalow vacated,” Mrityunjay Tiwari, RJD spokesperson, told this reporter over phone from Patna.The BJP has given a ministerial berth in the Modi government to Ram Vilas Paswan’s younger brother Pashupati Kumar Paras ignoring the late Union minister’s son Chirag Paswan's claims to the LJP founded by his father. Though Chirag has not betrayed any disgruntlement against the BJP for this, the RJD has been trying to woo him.Jitan Ram Manjhi, Hindustani Awami Party leader and former Bihar chief minister, has also written to the President to confer the Bharat Ratna on Ram Vilas Paswan and convert the Delhi bungalow into a memorial.  Ram Vilas Paswan died in October last year. Chirag Paswan, who lives in the bungalow, was asked to vacate it by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in August this year. However, the Jamui MP installed a bust of his late father inside the premises of the bungalow a few days back triggering off speculation that he was trying to create pressure upon the central government to allow him to retain the house.While Chirag has been allotted a residence in Delhi’s North Avenue, the sprawling bungalow has been allotted to Ashwini Vaishnaw, Minister of Railways, Communications and Electronics and Information Technology.Chirag, however, told reporters at Patna that as a lawmaker he would not do anything that amounts to encroachment or violation of law.“As of now, the government has permitted me to stay here. The bust is a symbol of the party's love for the late leader and will be shifted whenever an alternative arrangement is provided. The bust should never be seen as an attempt on my part to encroach the property,” Chirag said.Acknowledging that government rules do not allow converting any residence into a museum or a memorial, he said he would never support anything that goes against this and asserted that the party plans to install his father's bust or statue in every district across the country.Chirag also informed that he had invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to attend a mega event being organised by him at Patna on September 12 to pay tribute to his late father.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-opposition-parties-want-ram-vilas-paswans-delhi-bungalow-converted-into-a-memorial-308358

We dismiss and condemn all such efforts," she said.India's strong response came after Islamabad's envoy to the UN Munir Akram raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and spoke about the late pro-Pakistan leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani in his remarks in the General Assembly hall that focussed almost entirely on India and not on the forum's theme.Maitra said there could be no doubt that terrorism, which is a manifestation of intolerance and violence, is the antithesis of all religions and cultures. "The world should be concerned by terrorists who use religion to justify these acts and those who support them in this quest," she said.Underlining that India would continue to spread the message of humanity, democracy and non-violence, she said India reiterated its call for the application of the principles of objectivity, non-selectivity and impartiality to form the basis of discussions in the United Nations, especially on the issue of religion.

08-09-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||ISI favourites make it to Taliban govt, Hasan Akhund acting PM||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 7The Taliban on Tuesday announced a new government headed by Mullah Mohammad Hasan Akhund, comprising no woman and almost all members drawn from the insurgent group itself.Faced with fast-paced developments, Indian and Russian NSAs will hold extensive talks on Wednesday in this respect. Russian NSA Nikolay Patrushev will also call on PM Narendra Modi and Foreign MinisterS Jaishankar.The visit is a follow-up to PM Modi’s telephonic talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin during which they had agreed to set up a permanent communication channel on Afghan developments, said an MEA release.In Kabul, Mullah Baradar and Abdul Salam Hanafi will be the two deputies of Mullah Hasan, but of greater interest was the naming of ISI favourites Sirajuddin Haqqani, a designated global terrorist, and Mullah Yaqoob as the next Interior and Defence Ministers in a Cabinet of over two dozen men.Though dominated by the old guard, basically members from the Quetta Shura and the Haqqani network, the Taliban appointed a Tajik, Qari Fasihuddin, the architect of victories in northern Afghanistan, including Panjshir valley, as the army chief. Only six countries—Russia, China, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan and Qatar—have been invited so far to attend the inaugural ceremony.Significantly, the Taliban have removed the Ministry of Women’s Affairs from the Cabinet on a day women-led demonstrations were held in four Afghan cities, including Kabul, a day after Panjshir resistance leader Ahmad Massoud, who has gone underground, gave a call for national resistance.Days after the ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hamid’s visit, it began with a small demonstration by women in front of the Pakistani embassy. Minutes later, they were joined by hundreds of residents till aerial gunfire and a cane-charge by masked Taliban men dispersed them.Protests were also reported from the adjacent Shia Hazara-dominated provinces of Bamyan and Daikundi, besides Balkh, dominated by Tajiks and Hazaras. “Pakistan, Pakistan, Leave Afghanistan,” read a placard held aloft in Kabul.Cities dominated by non-Pashtuns have been on the edge ever since the Taliban bludgeoned its way into Panjshir valley to subdue Tajik Afghans amidst allegations of assistance from a Pakistani drone strike that killed two charismatic resistance leaders, including former journalist Fahim Dashti and some members of Ahmad Massoud’s family.Reports suggested that the ISI chief’s visit had led to reshuffle in the proposed Taliban Cabinet. Kabul was preparing for a change in government as old slogans and wall paintings were being whitewashed while journalists shared images of a university classroom where a curtain separated men and women students. PM-designate from mujahideen stockOld guard at helm, no woman inductedAbdul Ghani BaradarDeputy PM Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar led talks with the US and signed the deal that led to America’s final withdrawal from AfghanistanMullah HanafiThe second deputy to Akhund, Mullah Abdul Salam Hanafi is an ethnic Uzbek from the stronghold of erstwhile warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum.

08-09-2021||New Delhi||Rajnath approves increase in financial powers of armed forces for revenue procurement||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday approved the expansion of financial powers to the armed forces for revenue procurement to cut delays in making purchases for operational preparedness and quickly meet requirements of the field formations.The defence ministry said the delegated financial powers of vice chiefs of the services have been increased by 10 per cent subject to an overall ceiling of Rs 500 crore.It said the primary focus of the enhanced delegation of financial powers is to empower field commanders and other officials to procure equipment and “war-like stores” in a speedy manner for urgent operational necessities and meeting essential sustenance requirements.A new schedule on the hiring of aircraft and associated equipment has been introduced for the Indian Air Force which includes the hiring of air-to-air refuellers.Singh described the decision on expanding the financial powers as “another big step towards defence reforms”.The ministry said the enhanced delegation of financial powers to functionaries in service headquarters and lower formations would result in quicker decision-making at all levels and ensure better planning and operational preparedness.“Another big step towards defence reforms has been to strengthen security infrastructure. Financial powers have been devolved to field formations with focus on operational preparedness; promote ease of doing business and jointness among Services,” Singh tweeted.The last such enhancement at all levels for the defence services was done in 2016.“A general enhancement of up to two times has been approved for the competent financial authorities (CFAs). In certain schedules, this enhancement at field formations is in the range of up to 5-10 times on account of operational requirements,” the ministry said in a statement.“Delegated financial powers of vice chiefs of the services have been increased by 10 percent, subject to an overall ceiling of Rs 500 crore,” it said.The ministry said the financial powers of Chief of Integrated Defence Staff to the Chairman Chiefs Of Staff Committee (CISC) as CFA has been enhanced substantially and aligned with that of the vice chiefs of the services.“New CFAs have been added namely Deputy Chief of Army Staff, Master General Sustenance, ADG (Procurement)/DG Air Operations/DG Naval Operations, etc in service headquarters and in the field formations on account of reorganisation/restructuring/functional requirements,” the ministry said.It said new financial powers have been introduced for Navy and the Indian Air Force for their field commanders in line with the existing “Army schedule on ‘Army Commanders Special Financial Powers’”.“A new schedule on the hiring of aircraft and associated equipment has been introduced for Indian Air Force which includes the hiring of Air to Air re-fuellers,” the ministry said.For the Indian Navy, powers for replenishment of disaster management equipment and materials have been delegated to the command level for immediate response to natural disasters and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations.The ministry said an enabling provision of emergency financial powers to the field formations below command level for the defence services has now been incorporated in the emergency powers schedule that till present was available to vice chiefs and C-in-Cs (Commanding-in-Chief)/equivalent.

08-09-2021||---||Make our report public: Member of SC-instituted panel on farm laws||New Delhi, September 7As farmers regroup to intensify their protests against agricultural reform laws, Anil Ghanwat, a member of the Supreme Court instituted committee on the subject on Tuesday wrote to Chief Justice of India NV Ramana to make the panel report public.“It has been five months since the panel submitted its report in March. The report has neither been made public nor any deliberation held on it. As a farmer myself I am pained that the matter has not been resolved. The committee report should be put in public domain to enable a debate on the issue. It should not be put in cold storage. We had taken into account the suggestions of a range of stakeholders and the report could serve as a basis to resolve the ongoing impasse,” Ghanwat said.Read also:He noted that the farmers also need to exhibit flexibility on the issue and not stick to the demand of repeal of three laws. A rigid position of repeal will yield no solution, Ghanwat said, urging the SC to use the recommendations in the report and forward them to the government for action.Ghanwat added that the system that has existed for decades is flawed which is why farmers are committing suicides.“Some measure of reform in the sector is critical. Our appeal to the Chief Justice is to initiate a public debate on the committee report which can help resolve issues,” said Ghanwat. Farm union representatives had not deposed before the panel the SC had formed in January at the height of farmers’ agitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/make-our-report-public-member-of-sc-instituted-panel-on-farm-laws-307966
08-09-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai court temporarily blocks game based on Salman Khan's hit-and-run incident||A Mumbai civil court has ordered for temporary restraint on access to an online mobile game titled 'Selmon Bhoi', allegedly based on a hit-and-run incident involving Bollywood actor Salman Khan.Civil court judge K M Jaiswal passed the order on Monday and a copy of it was made available on Tuesday.The court restrained the makers of the game, Parody Studios Pvt Ltd and its directors, from disseminating, launching, re-launching and recreating the game or any other content relating to the actor.The court also directed the makers to immediately take-down/ block/ disable access to the game from Google Play Store and all other platforms. "Upon watching the game and its images, it prima facie matches with the identity of the plaintiff (Khan) and to the hit-and-run case connected to the plaintiff," the court said. It further said Khan had never given his consent for the game."When the plaintiff has not given his consent for developing of the game, which is very similar to his identity and the case against him, certainly his right to privacy is being deprived and his image is also being tarnished," the order said.The court added that the game developers used Khan's identity and popularity for commercial gain.Khan had filed an application in the court last month against the developers of the game, claiming that the name and images displayed in the game appeared to be his caricature version.The application claimed that the game "Selmon Bhoi" is phonetically the same as Khan's popular name amongst his fans, "Salman Bhai"."The game developers intentionally gained commercial advantage by exploiting the personality rights of our client without seeking our client's consent," said the actor's application filed through law firm DSK Legal.The court directed the developers to file their affidavit to Khan's plea and posted the matter for further hearing on September 20.The Bombay High Court in 2015 acquitted Khan of all charges in the 2002 hit-and-run case.

The comments have hurt the sentiments of the class as well as (affected) social harmony and I am also pained by it,” Bhupesh Baghel had said in a statement.“Nobody is above law under my government even if he is the chief minister’s 86-year-old father,” the Congress CM had said, adding an appropriate legal action will follow.He said the Chhattisgarh government respects every religion, caste and community and their sentiments, and gives equal importance to everyone, the statement added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chhattisgarh-cms-father-arrested-for-derogatory-remarks-against-community-307949
