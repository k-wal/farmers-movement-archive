Both Harpreet and Harmeet are absconding.“Our team is in Jammu and we are in contact with the families of the suspects. We have teams in Punjab also,” a senior police officer said.Meanwhile, Harmeet Singh, in a post on Facebook, claimed that he had killed Wazir after firing at his head following a heated argument and there was no role of Harpreet. Harmeet claimed that Wazir had planned to kill him and his son.A police staff had earlier said, “We have substantial leads in the case and our teams are working on them. In a complaint from the deceased’s brother, four people have been named. But as of now, we are focusing on the two prime suspects. We are looking into all the allegations raised by the family and probing the case from all angles.”                According to the police, the autopsy report has revealed that the victim suffered a gunshot injury in the temple area of the head. They said that CCTV footage of the area was analysed and it found that the accused were present in the building on Wednesday, a day before Wazir’s body was found.It looks like the NC leader was killed on September 2, they had said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-contact-with-families-of-2-suspects-in-killing-of-nc-leader-trilochan-wazir-delhi-police-310212

The aim was to “strength international cooperation for supporting stability in Afghanistan,” tweeted Al-Thani.Qatar has a huge stake in bringing about recognition for the Taliban as it had midwifed the so-called peace talks that led to the Taliban returning to power.The absence of recognition from the major world powers is leading to economic and humanitarian crises in Afghanistan. Long lines have formed outside banks which have restricted withdrawals and are refusing dollars to conserve foreign exchange. The UN has warned that 97 per cent of the Afghan population could slide into abject poverty next year.The west, India and Russia have reservations about Taliban’s treatment of women, the drug trade, accommodating non-Pashtun ethnic groups in the Government and denying safe sanctuary to groups that target other countries. The only group Taliban has spoken about discouraging is the one targeting China while it has been silent on LeT, JeM, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and Hizb ut-Tahrir.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/qatar-mediates-as-russia-has-reservations-about-taliban-310196

12-09-2021||New Delhi||SC to hear on Monday pleas seeking independent probe into Pegasus snooping row||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Monday a batch of pleas seeking an independent probe into the alleged snooping on certain people in India involving Israeli spyware Pegasus.A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana had on September 7 granted more time to the Centre to decide on filing a further response on the petitions after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said that due to some difficulties he could not meet the officials concerned to take a decision on the filing of the second affidavit.The Centre had earlier filed a limited affidavit in the apex court saying the pleas seeking an independent probe into the Pegasus snooping allegations are based on “conjectures and surmises or on other unsubstantiated media reports or incomplete or uncorroborated material”.On August 17, the top court had issued notice to the Centre on the pleas, making it clear that it did not want the government to disclose anything which compromises national security.In its short affidavit filed in the court earlier, the Centre had said the position on the issue has already been clarified in Parliament by Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.With a view of dispelling any wrong narrative spread by certain vested interests and examining the issues raised, the government will constitute a committee of experts, it had said.The top court, while issuing notice on the pleas, had said that it did not want the government to disclose anything related to the national security and had asked the Centre what is the “problem” if the competent authority files an affidavit before it on the issue.“Our considered response is what we have respectfully stated in our last affidavit. Kindly examine the issue from our point of view as our affidavit is sufficient,” the law officer had told the Bench, adding, “The Government of India is before the highest court of the country.”            The law officer had said if the government of any country divulges information about which software is used and which is not used, then those involved in terrorist activities may take pre-emptive measures.The pleas are related to reports of alleged snooping by government agencies on eminent citizens, politicians and scribes by using Israeli firm NSO’s spyware Pegasus.An international media consortium has reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-hear-on-monday-pleas-seeking-independent-probe-into-pegasus-snooping-row-310173

If the antibody level is 60 to 100, then we can say the person is antibody positive,” the ILS director said.He said the efficacies of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines are only 70 to 80 per cent.He explained that the inability to develop antibodies despite taking double doses of the Covid-19 vaccines could be due to individual difference in genetic order. “The fact is revealed through an antibody genome sequencing study,” Dr Parida said.Apart from children and adolescents in the age group of 0 to 18 years along with these 20 per cent vaccinated adults are vulnerable to Covid-19 infection, he said, adding that they need to be extra careful during the possible third wave of the pandemic.ILS, Bhubaneswar is a part of Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genome Consortium (INSACOG), a network of 28 labs across the country equipped to sequence genomes of the coronavirus for emerging variants.Institute of Life Sciences (ILS) was established in the year 1989 as an autonomous institute under the administrative control of Government of Odisha. In 2002, it was taken over by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India.Dr Parida said the Central government is mulling for a third dose, or a booster dose, for people who have not developed antibodies despite getting double doses of the vaccine.The ILS director said that the decision regarding the booster dose will be taken soon by the ICMR and deliberation is on whether the people with little antibodies should take the vaccine of the same or different brand.Dr Parida also said that no new variant of the virus except Delta Plus has been found in India so far.“We have tested around 600 samples across the country, but didn’t find any new mutant of the virus. If we are careful enough, we will manage to avoid the third wave of the pandemic,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/20-of-fully-vaccinated-people-in-odisha-fail-to-develop-antibodies-ils-310156
12-09-2021||New Delhi||Employee can’t insist on transfer to particular place, says SC||An employee cannot insist on a transfer to a particular place and it is for the employer to shift the staff considering the requirement, the Supreme Court has said.The apex court observed this while dismissing a petition by a lecturer challenging an October 2017 order of the Allahabad High Court.The high court had dismissed her plea against the rejection of her representation by the authority concerned for transfer from Amroha to Gautam Buddha Nagar.“It is not for the employee to insist to transfer him/her and/or not to transfer him/her at a particular place. It is for the employer to transfer an employee considering the requirement,” an apex court bench of justices M R Shah and Aniruddha Bose said in its September 6 order.In her petition filed in the high court, the woman, who was posted as a lecturer in Amroha district, had said that she had made a representation for her transfer to a college at Gautam Buddha Nagar and it was rejected in September 2017 by the authority.Her counsel had argued before the high court in 2017 that she was working at Amroha for the last four years and under the government policy, she was entitled to a transfer.The high court had noted that the order passed by the authority concerned showed that she had remained posted at a college at Gautam Buddha Nagar for about 13 years from the date of her initial appointment in December 2000 to August 2013 and, therefore, her request for posting her again at the same institution was not justified.In its order, the high court had said the petitioner was not entitled to be posted at a place where she had already worked at a stretch for about 13 years.                The high court had said that in case the petitioner has completed the requisite number of years at the place of her present posting, she may request for transfer to some other place but not to a place where she had already worked for 13 years.

They are our own flesh and blood. We need to start re-engaging with them in a respectful manner: understand their pain, their point of view and work with them in reaching common ground,” Gandhi had tweeted by posting a video of the large crowd in attendance.The mahapanchyat was held ahead of the crucial UP assembly polls early next year.The farmers have been protesting against the three farm laws at the borders of the national capital.Several rounds of discussions were also held between the representatives of protesting farmers’ unions and Union ministers but talks have remained inconclusive.The Centre has been insisting that the reforms have given farmers a new opportunity to sell their produce and rejected the criticism that the laws are aimed at doing away with the MSP regime and agricultural markets. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/increase-cane-prices-double-pm-kisan-funds-bjp-mp-varun-gandhi-writes-to-up-chief-minister-310151

The all-male list of cabinet members was dominated by members of the group’s old guard.“The government is not just not inclusive, it is sort of quite spectacularly ‘uninclusive’ even within the Taliban frame... The all-male old guard ultra-conservative Pashtun mullah government is disappointing and as narrow as possible,” Dalrymple said.And this could also be “good news” in the sense that it is unlikely for such a government to rule Afghanistan successfully.“The most successful governments in Afghanistan tend to be those who have the biggest tents, which would include all communities and therefore leave all communities satisfied after a point and do not create massive resentments. Now, this is not a government which I would imagine would successfully govern Afghanistan… (it) leaves 60 per cent of the country out. Pashtuns are only 40 per cent,” the Scottish historian-author said.“The smart thing would have been to do what they have done but dress it up but they haven’t even done that,” Dalrymple, who has extensively travelled in Afghanistan, added.Asked about India’s role in Afghanistan and whether he believes the neighbouring country could have done more for the people of the war-torn nation, Dalrymple said it is not for him to comment on the matter.Discussing the track record of West-backed governments in Afghanistan, he said historically different attempts were made to alter the will of Afghans and run their political lives—be it by the East India Company, the British Raj, the Russians or the latest by America – but they all came to nothing.The 56-year-old argued that the only man who did have the chance of making a Western-backed government work was Hamid Karzai who led the first Afghan government in 2001 and served as President until 2014.“The Taliban government listed in 2001 were so brutal and so unpopular that when Karzai came there was a huge goodwill. When tribal leaders came in from distant parts of Afghanistan he would give them great honour. He was extremely good at making people feel important and that he was someone on their side,” said Dalrymple.“He used inclusive language, constantly encouraged the Taliban to give up the mobility struggle and come into the government. If anyone could have made it work it was him, a man of enormous charm but then it was always going to be difficult,” he admitted.Dalrymple’s opinion of Karzai’s successor, Ashraf Ghani, is different. He termed Ghani, who fled the war-torn country on August 15 after the Taliban entered Kabul, “divisive” and “unafghan-like in his style”. The US completed its military withdrawal on August 31.According to Dalrymple, the 72-year-old Ghani, a World Bank-trained Columbia University technocrat, is rude and once famously threw an ashtray at a woman journalist during a press conference.“Tribal leaders who would walk in from the other end of the country would be given five minutes only. He would take his shoes off and would put them up on a footrest and then point it at the tribal leaders. These sort of things were seen as a huge offense to the conservative Afghans,” he added.Ghani’s act of fleeing the country at the time of crisis has only “exacerbated” his problems, and Dalrymple said he just cannot imagine him returning to Afghanistan again.“It destroys his (Ghani’s) influence forever. You don’t know what anyone of us would have done in the same situation because Afghan presidents have been killed .. castrated. One can understand his fears but there’s no question that it exacerbated his problems. I can’t imagine it (him coming home),” he said.Published by Bloomsbury in 2012, “Return of a King: The Battle for Afghanistan” is a retelling of the First Anglo-Afghan war (1839-42) fought between the British Empire and Afghanistan. The conflict resulted in Britain”s greatest military humiliation of the 19th century.

12-09-2021||Guwahati||Assam boat capsize: 6 Inland Water Transport staffers arrested, 3 others detained||At least six employees of Assam’s Inland Water Transport (IWT) Department have been arrested for allegedly committing mistakes sans which the boat capsize in the Brahmaputra that has left two persons dead and one missing could have been avoided, and charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, police said on Sunday.At least two persons died and one went missing after a private boat with 92 passengers on board capsized following a head-on collision with a government-owned ferry near Nimati Ghat in Jorhat district on September 8.Three people working in the private boat were picked up for questioning, while several officials were summoned for recording their statements, Jorhat Superintendent of Police Ankur Jain said.“We have arrested six IWT staffers from Nimati Ghat after finding out that they had committed mistakes as they did not follow the procedures. The accident could have been avoided,” Jain said.The police have registered a case under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) read with Section 34 (criminal act done by several persons for the common intention of all) of the Indian Penal Code, and all the accused have been charged with these provisions, he added.“Three persons working in the private boat at Kamalabari in Majuli district were also picked up for questioning. We are coordinating with Majuli Police and a team from Jorhat will reach there,” Jain said.Asked whether any IWT officer has been taken into custody, Jain replied in negative but said that many officials posted at Nimati Ghat were called for questioning for recording their statements.“Presently, we are trying to reconstruct the scenario and find out how the accident took place,” the SP said without sharing further details.The collision took place when private boat ‘Ma Kamala’ was heading towards Majuli from Nimati Ghat with passengers and vehicles, while government ferry ‘MB Tipkai’ was coming from the world’s largest river island.Visiting the accident spot the next day, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that in the initial probe, “mismanagement” was found to be the prime reason for the accident.Meanwhile, various agencies such as National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), police and district administrations are conducting an extensive search in the accident spot and even 100 km downstream for the missing person.He was identified as Bikramjit Barua, a doctor hailing from Jorhat who was posted in Majuli.

12-09-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena will contest Uttar Pradesh, Goa Assembly polls: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday said his party will contest the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Goa due early next year, and claimed farmers’ organisations in western UP are willing to support his party.Talking to reporters here, Raut said the Shiv Sena will field candidates in 80 to 100 seats in UP (which has a 403-member Assembly), while it will contest about 20 seats in the Goa Assembly (which comprises 40 seats).“Farmers’ organisations in western UP have expressed their willingness to support the Shiv Sena and we may ally with smaller parties. In Goa, efforts are on to explore a formula like MVA. Let’s see if we succeed,” the Rajya Sabha member said.Raut further said the Shiv Sena has its cadre in these two states and has been contesting elections, irrespective of success or failure.After the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly polls, the Shiv Sena snapped ties with long-term ally BJP over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post, and forged an alliance with the NCP and Congress to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state.Asked about the resignation of Vijay Rupani as Gujarat chief minister, Raut said, “It is an internal matter of the BJP, outsiders need not comment. I have known Rupani since he was the Rajya Sabha member with me.”“Last time, the BJP just managed to cross the majority mark (in the 182-member Gujarat Assembly). The situation this time is not good for the party,” he claimed.To a question on Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray’s role at the national level, Raut said, “Thackeray has the capability to become a national leader. A Maharashtra C Minister is a national leader.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shiv-sena-will-contest-uttar-pradesh-goa-assembly-polls-sanjay-raut-310132

Today, the world is realising that tragedies like 9/11 will have a permanent solution only through humanitarian values. — Narendra Modi, PM“September 11 is the date etched in world history for a brutal assault on humanity. It is also a day that taught the world a lot. A century ago, on September 11, 1893, Swami Vivekananda addressed the World Parliament of Religions and introduced the world to the human values of India. Today, the world is realising that tragedies like 9/11 will have a permanent solution only through these humanitarian values,” the PM said.He was speaking at a virtual event to dedicate Sardardham Bhavan in Ahmedabad to people.

Today, including the Supreme Court and High Courts, there are less than 12 per cent women judges,” the President said at the foundation stone-laying ceremony of National Law University in Allahabad.“If we want to achieve the directive principles of our Constitution, we must increase the participation of women in the judiciary,” he said, expressing hope that the number of women lawyers, officials, and judges in the Allahabad High Court would increase.Maintaining that women have proven to be better equipped and more inclined towards imparting justice, he said, “Ordinarily, women have a greater inclination towards justice. Though there may be certain exceptions to this, they have the nature, mentality, and quality to impart justice. Be it parents, in-laws, husband or children, working women maintain a balance among all and yet, in their workplace act as examples of excellence.” He said there was a need to ensure adequate facilities for the subordinate judiciary and increase the number of working judges.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/must-have-greater-representation-of-women-in-judiciary-president-309848

The Taliban’s military offensive against the Panjshiris after just three hours of talks, along with rumours of Pakistan’s involvement, has further incensed the neighbouring Tajikistan.A large number of civil society activists have petitioned the Tajikistan Government to bar Pakistan PM Imran Khan from attending a summit of regional countries next week. Human rights activist Oynihol Bobonazarova and filmmaker Anisa Sabiri were among the signatories who sought a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) probe into Pakistan’s involvement in crushing the resistance in Panjshir.The strong sentiments in Tajikistan towards a Pashtun dominated takeover of Kabul were explicitly flagged by Tajik President President Emomali Rahmon at a meeting with Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. The Tajik civil society did not want the Pakistan PM to visit Dushanbe till he “refuses to interfere in Afghanistan’s internal affairs” and an inclusive government was created in Kabul.Though the Taliban have claimed to have captured all the districts of the Panjshir valley, the National Resistance Front (NRF) said, “The mujahideen, the resistance forces and your sons will fight to death to defend your values and honour.”“Right now, resistance forces are present in all mountains,” local media quoted Panjshiri politician Abdul Latif Pedram as saying.

They said the “kingpin” of the alleged scam was Chandan Kumar Sinha, a senior social security assistant in the Kandivali regional office, and Uttam Tagaray and Vijay Jarpe, both assistant provident fund commissioners in Coimbatore and Chennai regional offices, respectively. According to the CBI FIR, a copy of which is with The Tribune, the vigilance department of the EPFO had learnt about the alleged scam on May 18 following an anonymous tip-off.Soon after, the department started an internal audit that revealed that crores had been siphoned off from the pension fund corpus through manipulation of the system by insiders, the officials said. They said based on the revelations, the EPFO filed the complaint with the CBI on August 24.According to the complaint, the accused knew the system and its loopholes well and used the data of migrant workers to defraud the organisation during the pandemic.“The modus operandi of the racket included creating bogus PF accounts using bank account and Aadhaar collected from migrant workers and poor people for which they paid a small commission. They then portrayed them as employees of companies shut down in the wake of the pandemic and withdrew the amount by filing fake claims,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/3-epfo-officials-booked-in-rs2-7-cr-pension-scam-309851

Many traditional materials have been found to be good at controlling higher frequencies.However, natural beehives are known to efficiently control high and low frequencies because of their geometry.“It has been found during theoretical analysis and experimental investigation that beehives dissipate noise due to conversion of acoustical energy into vibrational energy. This vibrational energy is dissipated in the form of heat due to wall damping property. Mimicking this property as an engineering solution could offer a cost-effective method for controlling noise pollution,” said B Venkatesham of the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, IIT, Hyderabad.The research team fabricated thin and strong acoustic panels mimicking the natural beehive property.“We used a biometric design methodology. The methodology involved understanding the physics of bee hive sample’s acoustic energy dissipation and then mimicking its design. The team developed a mathematical model and optimised parameters, then fabricated the test samples using systematic, controlled parameters. Subsequently, fabrication of a large sample was done,” researchers said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-tackle-noise-pollution-experts-make-beehive-like-panels-309861

It will take some years until it is able to take part in the sharper aspects of the drills, but moving towards Quad amphibious exercise is sensible,” said strategic analyst Ashley Townshend.Both Foreign Ministers S Jaishankar and Marise Payne agreed on the “lack of inclusiveness in Afghanistan’s new dispensation” as also the status of women there. With Singh and Dutton, they discussed the need to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a “breeding ground for terror groups”. They also discussed the Asia Pacific and the situation in the South China Sea, which was the focus of another meeting between senior Chinese and Vietnamese leaders.Simultaneously, Vietnam, an Indian ally which has clashed with China in the South China Sea, signed a deal with Japan for defence equipment and technology.Jaishankar said using a term like NATO for Quad was like looking back into the Cold War. “Quad looks in the future. It reflects globalisation, compulsions of countries to work together—vaccines, supply chains, connectivity,” he said at a news conference.In their final engagement in India, the visiting Australian ministers called on PM Narendra Modi. They had arrived from Indonesia after holding another 2+2.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/taliban-regime-not-inclusive-agree-india-australia-at-22-309837

Sources indicated that Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya (49), state Deputy CM Nitin Patel, Union minister Parshottam Rupala and state unit chief CR Patil are among the frontrunners for the CM’s post. The name of state minister RC Faldu is also among probables.The BJP legislature party is expected to meet tomorrow to elect the new leader. After tendering his resignation to Governor Acharya Devvrat, Rupani said, “I am grateful to the PM for affording me the opportunity to contribute to Gujarat’s development journey. The state needs to move forward under the PM’s leadership with new vigour now. The party has a tradition of workers executing the responsibility given to them. I will do the same. I was a party worker and will remain one.”Rupani is the fourth BJP CM to resign in six months after Trivendra Rawat and Tirath Singh Rawat in Uttrakhand and BS Yediyurappa in Karnataka.Sources said the need to win big in Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah’s home state weighed on BJP’s mind while executing the smooth ouster of Rupani. The PM acted in time to recover lost ground, they added.Yesterday, BJP’s organisational general secretary BL Santosh met Rupani asking him to resign. A day before, Amit Shah met Rupani in Ahmedabad.Among probable replacements, Mandaviya has age on his side. His rise in the BJP has been spectacular. He became Rajya Sabha member in 2012 and has since risen up the ladder becoming Union Health Minister this July. If Mandaviya is picked, he would need to get elected to the Assembly in six months, while state elections are just about a year away.Sources said the principal challenge for the party is to decide whether to name a Patidar as CM in which case Nitin Patel (65) could take lead.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-chief-minister-vijay-rupani-quits-4th-bjp-cm-to-go-in-6-months-309838

Bare shells may also be taken on lease. Outright purchase of coaches can also be done”.According to sources, the plan is that the interested parties have to buy or lease a train with a minimum of 16 coaches.This comes at a time when the railways’ efforts to draw in private players to run its “private trains” is receiving very little interest from India Inc.According to the release, the proposed model will allow private parties to conduct minor refurbishment of coaches and leasing of coaches for a minimum period of 5 years and extendable till codal life of coaches.The interested party will develop or decide on the business model (routes, itinerary, tariff).“Indian Railways will levy haulage charges, nominal stabling charges and lease charges.

Mandaviya is 49-year-old, and scores on the age card, with the BJP, of late banking on younger leaders in matters of change of guard.Nitinbhai Patel, union minister Parshottam Rupala, state BJP in charge CR Patil, state minister RC Faldu and BJP Gujarat vice president Gordhan Zadafia are also among probables.BJP sources said the legislative party meeting is expected to be held on Tuesday to elect the new CM.As of today, Mandaviya is already in Gujarat and has met Rupani.BJP in-charge for Gujarat Bhupendra Yadav and party organisational secretary BL Santosh are also there with Home Minister Amit Shah expected to reach Ahmedabad to get a sense of the leaders on the way forward.Rupani while resigning spoke of the need for new energy in the state and thanked the prime minister for allowing a 'worker like him to contribute to the development journey of the state.""I am grateful to the PM who allowed me to contribute to the Gujarat development journey.The journey must go on with new energy and focus under the leadership of the PM. The hallmark of the BJP is infusion of new energy. We as party workers execute the responsibility the party gives us and I will also do the same."Rupani's resignation comes barely five years after Anandiben Patel resigned making way for him.The resignation is learnt to be rooted in ground surveys that suggest huge anti-incumbency against Rupani.The BJP cannot afford to allow electoral dents in Gujarat, the home state of PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah.The change of guard, sources said, is in line with the BJP's urge to become battle ready in key election bound states.Similar changes recently happened in Karnataka and Uttrakhand.Sources said the challenge for the BJP is to strike a caste balance at a time when the state Congress in charge of Hardik Patel, the face of the Patidar Anamat Andolan, which had allowed the Congress to make considerable dents in BJP's Gujarat bastions in the last state elections, even though the BJP had eventually won.Any dilution in BJP's electoral prowess in Gujarat would mean a dilution in the public image of the PM and Shah, something the BJP can ill afford.That explains the party's urge to replace the CM well in time to lay a ground for 2022 polls.The BJP has been in power in Gujarat for over 20 years now, having won all elections since 2002. This would be the fifth direct term the BJP will be seeking and the second since Narendra Modi became PM in 2014.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mansukh-mandaviya-nitin-patel-among-frontrunners-after-rupani-steps-down-as-gujarat-cm-309782

The suspect who had been arrested within a few hours of the incident has been now charged with murder. While the city police formed a Special Investigation Team to probe the incident, opposition BJP demanded capital punishment for the accused and questioned if women were safe in Maharashtra.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray termed the incident a "blot on humanity"."The trial in the case will be held on a fast track and the victim, who succumbed to injuries today, will get justice," he said in a statement. He has discussed the case with state Home Minister Dilip Walse-Patil and Mumbai Police Commissioner Hemant Nagrale, Thackeray added.Woman raped, brutally assaulted in stationary vehicle in Mumbai’s SakinakaThe Sakinaka area in the western suburbs has several industrial units. According to police, accused Mohan Chouhan (45) worked as a driver and lived on the pavement in the same area.Besides being raped, the victim woman was assaulted with an iron rod in her private parts and lost a lot of blood, a police official said. She had also been stabbed with a knife, he added.Police commissioner Nagrale told reporters that the crime came to light when the watchman of a company located on Khairani Road called the police control room and said that a man was seen thrashing a woman.Police reached the spot within 10 minutes and found the victim inside a parked tempo. As her condition was serious, they decided to take her to the hospital in the same vehicle so as to save time. They got the key of the tempo from the watchman and drove her to Rajawadi hospital in suburban Ghatkopar, the commissioner said.The police also obtained CCTV footage of the spot. A man seen leaving the tempo was identified as Mohan Chouhan who hails from Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, the commissioner said.He was arrested and produced before a court which sent him in police custody till September 21, Nagrale said.His blood-stained clothes were seized. They would be sent for forensic analysis to find out if it is the victim's blood, the commissioner added.A Special Investigation Team has been formed to conduct the probe, he said."Assistant Commissioner of Police Jyotsna Rasam will be the investigation officer. The probe will be completed within a month, and the case will be tried before a fast-track court as the chief minister announced," the commissioner said."As the victim was unconscious, her statement could not be recorded. Therefore police are as yet clueless about what exactly happened. But it will be ascertained during the investigation," Nagrale said.The probe so far has revealed the involvement of only one person in the crime, the commissioner said.On Friday the police had booked the accused under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder), 376 (rape), 323 (assault) and 34 (common intention). After the victim died, section 302 (murder) was added, while section 34 was dropped as the involvement of any other person in the crime has not come to light, a police release said.Leader of Opposition in the state Legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis demanded that Chief Minister meet the Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court and request him to hold the trial of the case in a fast-track court."I know that awarding a sentence is in the hands of the judiciary. But I feel the culprit in the Sakinaka rape should be hanged to death," the BJP leader said.  Another BJP leader Pravin Darekar said the "onus" of the incident was entirely on the Shiv Sena-led state government "because there is no respect left for the law".State BJP vice-president Chitra Wagh called for a new act on the lines of SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act so that the culprits involved in cases of atrocities against women do not get bail easily. She also pointed out that the state women's commission does not have a chairperson for over a year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-woman-who-was-raped-assaulted-with-rod-in-private-parts-dies-in-hospital-309744
