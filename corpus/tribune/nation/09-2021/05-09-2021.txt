The details of all these were obtained and the suspects were zeroed in,” he said.On the night of August 27 and 28, raids were conducted at various places in India including Nalanda (Bihar), Faridabad (Haryana), Ludhiana (Punjab) and Delhi. This led to the arrest of four members of the gang, said the officer.“During interrogation, accused Vikas revealed that he along with his associates used to purchase the domain names of big brands and got the websites developed in such a manner that it appeared genuine. One phone number was also displayed on the website. When someone called on the given number for distributorship of the brand, he was asked to pay fees on pretext of various charges,” he said.Vikas used to switch location between Bihar and Ludhiana. In Ludhiana, he used to stay for months and do the same work there with accused Vinod and Santosh, who both are his relatives. They were given commission from the cheated amount, the DCP said.

According to the parameters, the entire label has been given a special texture honeycomb effect which is visible only at a specific angle.At strategic locations, the honeycomb design has been altered slightly and certain additional special elements added to the texture design such that it is not visible to the layman, but people who know the subtle changes can easily check and verify the authenticity of the label and vial.The anti-counterfeit features in the Covaxin label include invisible UV helix (DNA-like structure) which is only visible under UV light, micro text hidden in label claim dots, which is written as COVAXIN, green foil effect in X of “Covaxin” and holographic effect on COVAXIN.As for Sputnik, imported products are from two different bulk manufacturing sites from Russia and, hence, there are two different labels for both these sites. While all the information and design are the same, only the manufacturer name is different.For all the imported products till now, the English label is only available on the front and back of the carton of 5 ampoule pack, while for all other sides, including the primary label on the ampoule, it is in Russian.

The opposition and these farmer union leaders have been using the shoulders of farmers to engage in politics,” he said.Chahar claimed that no government has done so much for farmers as the one led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in the last seven years.The farmers’ protest at Delhi’s borders against the three contentious laws has been going on for over nine months. They have been demanding the repeal of the laws, which they feel will do away with the MSP system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.

There might be certain issues with a portal run by Infosys, but the article published by Panchjanya in this context only reflects individual opinion of the author,” Ambekar said.“Panchjanya is not a mouthpiece of the RSS and the said article or opinion expressed in it should not be linked with the RSS,” Ambekar added.In its cover story titled ‘Saakh Aur Aghaat’ the Panchjanya accused Infosys of helping ‘Tukde-tukde gang’, naxals and other anti-national forces.Pointing to regular incidents of glitches in IT portals developed by Infosys, resulting in trouble for tax payers and investors, the Panchjanya article said that such incidents brought down the trust of taxpayers in the Indian economy.The article called Infosys ‘naam bade aur darshan chhote’ (great cry and little wool). The Panchjanya article claimed that this was not the first time Infosys had done this to a government project.“First time mistake can be called a coincidence but if the same mistake happens repeatedly, it raises doubts. There are accusations that the Infosys management is deliberately trying to destabilise India’s economy,” the article said.The article also claimed that Infosys has been accused of helping ‘Naxals, leftists and tukde-tukde gangs’.“Infosys is accused of providing assistance to Naxals, Leftists and the Tukde Tukde Gang. The issue of Infosys directly or indirectly supporting divisive forces in the country has already come out in the open,” the article said. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-distances-itself-from-panchjanya-article-criticising-infosys-307103

Lessons on these great personalities will inculcate values, principles, social and medical ethics in the students,” Sarang told PTI.The next academic session for MBBS students is likely to start by this year-end.“The National Medical Council (NMC) has said that ethical values should be the part of the foundation course in the first year (of MBBS). So we thought of incorporating these great personalities for building the character of students,” he said.The minister said states finalise the content of the foundation course.Keshav Baliram Hedgewar, a surgeon, founded the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh in Nagpur in 1925, based on the ideology of Hindutva. Deendayal Upadhyaya was one of the prominent leaders of the Bhartiya Jana Sangh, the forerunner of the BJP.“RSS first chief Hedgewarji, Upadhyayaji, Vivekanandji and BR Ambedkarji were great visionaries and human beings. Their lives were based on values. Their thoughts, conduct, and the very personalities are inspiring”, the minister said.He said Hedgewar had actively participated in India’s freedom struggle. “Deendayalji’s thought of ‘Antyodaya’ for helping the last man (the poorest of the poor) was exemplary. Swami Vivekanandji travelled far off lands to showcase the Indian vision. B R Ambedkar was born in a poor family but he went on to frame our Constitution. We have decided to teach (MBBS) students about the inspiring lives of these great personalities from the coming academic session (2021),” Sarang added.The NMC decides the syllabus of the MBBS course. It sets topics for each subject but the education department of States is empowered to prepare the content of the Foundation Course subject, sources in the medical fraternity said.The lectures on Hedgewar, Upadhyaya and others are likely to be clubbed in the topic of medical ethics in the foundation course, they added.Lectures in the foundation course are generally given to students for a month after they take admission for MBBS, the sources added.About 2,000 students take admission in the MBBS course every year in Madhya Pradesh.

But it expressed objection towards such “reprehensible and disgraceful” actions.The strong statement came after some students and youth organisations belonging to both the ruling alliance and the Opposition burnt effigies of Prime Minister Modi during protests over the death of a Nepalese youth when he was crossing the Mahakali river near the border with India in July.“The Government of Nepal wishes to have a friendly relationship with all friendly nations and is determined not to let any activities that may harm the national interest. We request everyone not to carry out any action that may hurt the dignity and respect of the friendly nations,” the statement said.Nepal has a long tradition of solving the dispute with the neighbouring nation through diplomatic channels and mutual dialogue, the statement said.“In future as well, diplomatic initiative and mutual discourse will be utilised while solving any dispute,” it said.The home ministry will take action to control the activities targeted against the friendly neighbouring nation and will punish those who involve themselves in such unlawful activities, it warned.Jaya Singh Dhami, 33, of Byas rural municipality in Darchula district, is stated to have jumped into the river from the carriage of the tuin (a makeshift ropeway with a box attached for seating) he was clinging to after he saw an approaching patrol of the India-Nepal border guarding force Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).Officials in India said the man was crossing over to the Indian side “illegally” using the tuin and was coming from Darchula in Nepal to Gasku in Dharchula in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district.A Nepalese committee investigating the death of Dhami has concluded that the incident occurred in the presence of Indian security personnel.

Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut asks Centre||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday said the exclusion of former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru's picture from a poster released by a body of the Union Education Ministry to mark the 75th year of India's independence shows the Centre's "narrow mindset", and asked the Union government why it "hates" Nehru so much.Raut, in his weekly column 'Rokhthok' in the Sena mouthpiece Saamana, said the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), an autonomous body under the Ministry of Education, has excluded the pictures of Nehru and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad from its poster, and alleged that it was an act of "political vindictiveness"."Those who had no participation in the freedom struggle and creating history are keeping out one of the heroes of the independence struggle. This act, done out of political vindictiveness, is not good and shows their narrow mindset. It is an insult of each and every freedom fighter," Raut claimed. One can have differences over Nehru's policies after Independence, but no one can deny his contribution to the freedom struggle, said the Rajya Sabha Member, who is the executive editor of Saamana. "What has Nehru done to hate him so much? In fact, the institutions he built are now being sold to keep the Indian economy moving," Raut said, while referring to the National Monetization Pipeline (announced recently by the Centre), and claimed it was due to Nehru's "long-term vision" that the country was saved from economic devastation. Raut, whose party shares power with the NCP and Congress in Maharashtra, said Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin recently took a decision not to remove pictures of former state CMs Jayalalitha and E K Palaniswami from school bags which were being distributed free to children in the southern state.  "If he (Stalin) can show political maturity, why do you hate Nehru so much? You owe an answer to the nation," the Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson said, without naming the BJP. The Modi government's criticism of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was understandable, he said, claiming that the Centre made its hatred public by changing the name of the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award. "You cannot destroy the immortal contribution of Nehru and (former prime minister) Indira Gandhi in nation-building. Those who deny Nehru's contributions will be called villains of  history," Raut further claimed.

Students appearing for such competitive exams prepare very hard. We owe them a fair exam. GOI is better at providing cover-ups. Party spokesperson Gaurav Vallabh in a press conference today cited the arrest of seven persons in the case by the CBI as a matter of grave concern. He said raised questions on the sanctity of the exams conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) under the Ministry of Education."If such a prestigious exam as JEE (Mains), which is the entry point to top centrally funded technical institutes, can be manipulated, what is the guarantee that other exams conducted by the NTA have been transparent? The government and the NTA must answer the youth of the country," said Vallabh.The Congress cited the alleged fraud in the 4th session of JEE (Mains), 2021, with the CBI registering a case against a private institute (Affinity Education Pvt. Ltd) and its directors and three employees on the allegations of committing fraud in conducting the exam.“As per the CBI, the institute was involved in helping students cheat. The institute also collected money from students after their selection. Preliminary probe has found that the question paper of the applicants was accessed remotely from a chosen examination centre in Haryana as the entire examination is a computer-based test.

Electricity rates are high while sugarcane rates have not gone up.The event provided a fresh lease of life to the agitation, particularly in Ghazipur where Tikait’s brother and BKU chief Naresh Tikait had already called it off following the Republic Day violence. The ‘mahapanchayat’ was followed by similar events in Haryana and western UP, which strengthened the movement. Seven months down the line, farmers are again assembling for another ‘mahapanchayat’at the GIC grounds in Muzaffarnagar on Sunday.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) has called the September 5 event as the launch of its ‘Mission UP-Uttarakhand’ against the BJP ahead of Assembly elections in the two states. It said mobilisation meetings had taken place in several states, including UP, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Maharashtra.“It’s tough to say how many people will arrive, but I am confident it will be a massive gathering. No one can stop the farmers and if someone does, they will force their way to reach the venue,” Rakesh Tikait was quoted as saying. He urged people to be a part of the “historic event”, being viewed as a show of strength against the BJP’s Yogi Adityanath government ahead of the next Assembly elections.Rakesh Tikait said the ‘mahapanchayat’ was not linked to elections alone. “Farmers are facing hardships in UP. Electricity rates are the highest while sugarcane rates have not gone up since 2016. The Centre has increased cane FRP by Rs 5, a mere five paise per kg hike. Isn’t it an insult to farmers?” he said.Farmers have been planning to organise several ‘mahapanchayats’ in the poll-bound states in the first phase of their campaign. The SKM had also campaigned against the BJP during the West Bengal polls and claims “it contributed to the saffron party’s rout in the state”.Rakesh Tikait said 5,000 volunteers had been given duties and issued identity cards to ensure smooth movement of farmers to the venue. “We have arranged 12-14 screens and four to five fields for those unable to reach the main site as roads and parking areas will be jammed,” he said.The district administration, meanwhile, has made elaborate security measures. Six companies of the provincial armed constabulary (PAC) and two companies of rapid action force (RAF) have been deployed, according to reports. The event will be also videographed in view of recent happenings in Haryana where violence occurred during protests against politicians.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/samyukt-kisan-morchas-show-of-strength-in-uttar-pradeshs-muzaffarnagar-today-306775

We have to watch Pakistan’s actions with a fine tooth comb,” Shringla said on Saturday at the end of his visit to Washington. “The Taliban have indicated they would be reasonable in addressing New Delhi’s concerns,” he added in reference to an MEA team’s August 31 meeting with the Taliban Leadership Council’s Sher Mohammed Stanikzai in Doha.Antony Blinken, US Secy of StateHope Taliban will keep their wordThe expectation is to see a government that makes good on commitments that the Taliban have made, particularly on freedom of travel, not allowing Afghanistan to be used as a launching ground for terrorism & upholding basic rights of people, including women & minorities.“Our engagement has been limited. Whatever conversation we’ve had so far, the Taliban seem to indicate they will be reasonable in addressing India’s concerns,” Shringla said. “The situation is very fluid and you have to see whether the assurances that have been made publicly are actually maintained on the ground, and how things work out,” he explained, dispelling the impression that a wait and watch policy meant doing nothing. Government formation in Afghanistan remains a work-in-progress. There has been no public debate on its structure or constituents but for statements from Taliban leaders that Mullah Haibatullah and Mullah Baradar would hold the top two positions. The ISI chief’s visit is being seen against the backdrop of a stalemate in government formation. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid on Saturday said the formation of a new government had been put off to next week.The Taliban sought to batten down resistance from the Panjshir Valley by moving heavy weaponry up the surrounding hills and is trying to enter Shotul district, the mouth of Panjshir Valley, where it has reportedly placed containers to restrict access. “We are doing what’s humanly possible with what we have. Pray for us,’’ said a social media handle of the National Resistance Front or Resistance 2.In Kabul, women rights activists and journalists protested for the second day and the Taliban used force to disperse the crowd.Celebratory fire kills 17At least 17 persons were killed in celebratory gunfire in Kabul, news agencies said on Saturday, after Taliban sources said their fighters had seized control of Panjshir, the last province in Afghanistan holding out against the Islamist group.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isi-chief-in-kabul-india-watching-afghanistan-events-pak-actions-carefully-306778

What followed was a string of ‘kisan mahapanchayats’ at various locations, including in Haryana and Western UP, and an increase in the stature of Rakesh Tikait.The farmers protesting against the three central laws are again assembling for a ‘kisan mahapanchayat’ in the GIC grounds of Muzaffarnagar on Sunday.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions spearheading the stir, says farmers from UP, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Maharashtra will take part in it, adding that mobilisation meetings have taken place in several places in these states.“It is impossible to tell a figure, but I can promise people will be there in large numbers. No one can stop the farmers from reaching the venue. If they are stopped, they will force their way there,” Rakesh Tikait has been quoted as saying.Meanwhile, Tikait has urged the masses to be a part of “historic event” which is being seen as a show of strength against the BJP’s Yogi Adityanath government ahead of the upcoming elections.Interestingly, in the January ‘mahapanchayat’, Naresh Tikait is believed to have said it was “their mistake” to support BJP candidate, Union Minister Sanjiv Balyan against (late) RLD chief Ajit Singh in the last Lok Sabha elections.Rakesh Tikait, who said that a huge number of people will be there, added that the ‘mahapanchayat’ is not linked to just elections.“Farmers are facing hardships in UP, electricity rates are the highest, sugarcane rates have not gone up since last 2016. The Centre has increased (FRP) by Rs 5 — that is five paise per kg. Are you insulting farmers?” Rakesh Tikait said.Farmers are planning to organise several ‘mahapanchayats’ in the poll-bound state in the first phase of their campaign.Rakesh Tikait said 5,000 volunteers have been given duties and issued identity cards to ensure smooth movement so the farmers reach the venue. “All arrangements have been made. We have arranged 12-14 screens and 4-5 fields for those who are unable to reach the main site as roads and parking areas will be jammed,” he said.The district administration, meanwhile, has stepped up the security measures in view of the event. Elaborate security arrangements and six companies of the provincial armed constabulary (PAC) and two companies of rapid action force (RAF) have been deployed, according to reports. In light of recent happenings in Haryana, the event will be also videographed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-set-for-kisan-mahapanchayat-in-muzaffarnagar-on-sunday-tikait-calls-it-historic-moment-306709
05-09-2021||New Delhi||Government signs peace accord with 5 insurgent groups of Assam||A tripartite agreement among five insurgent groups of Assam, the Centre, and the state government was signed on Saturday to end years of violence in the Karbi Anglong region.Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who was present on the occasion, said the accord will bring lasting peace and all round development in Karbi Anglong.The insurgent groups which signed the peace accord are: People’s Democratic Council of Karbi Longri (PDCK), Karbi Longri NC Hills Liberation Front (KLNLF), Karbi People’s Liberation Tiger (KPLT), Kuki Liberation Front (KLF), and United Peoples Liberation Army (UPLA).About 1,000 militants belonging to these groups have surrendered along with their arms and have joined the mainstream.Shah said the signing of the Karbi-Anglong Agreement is another milestone in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “insurgency-free prosperous Northeast”.“Over 1000 armed cadres have abjured violence and joined the mainstream of society, which reflects their trust in Modi ji’s leadership,” he said.Shah said that a Rs 1,000 crore development package will be given to Karbi Anglong.“I want to assure everyone that we will implement this accord in a time-bound manner,” he said.The home minister said the central and state governments are committed to all round development of Karbi Anglong and there will be peace in the region.“We not only sign peace accords but implement them within our time too,” he said, citing the example of similar peace pacts earlier signed with other insurgent groups of the Northeast—the NDFB, NLFT and Bru groups.Shah said ever since the Modi government came to power, its focus in the Northeast is not only to ensure peace but also overall development.“We have ensured that there is all-round peace, no violence, no blast, no firing in the Northeast,” he said   The accord is significant as Karbi Anglong, which is the territory of ethnic Karbi tribals, has seen years of violence, killings, and abduction in the rebels’ fight for a separate homeland.Union minister and former Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who was present on the occasion, appreciated the efforts of the prime minister and the home minister in bringing peace in Assam and the Northeast.Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said it was a historic day as the militants of these five insurgent groups will now join the mainstream and work for the development of Karbi Anglong. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-signs-peace-accord-with-5-insurgent-groups-of-assam-306702
05-09-2021||New Delhi||Collegium recommends 82 more names for appointment as HC judges||Faced with a vacancy of 465 judges against a sanctioned strength of 1,098 in 25 high courts, the Supreme Court Collegium has gone into overdrive to appoint judges.“The Collegium has recommended, if I am not wrong, yesterday 82 names to various high courts. I hope the Honourable Law Minister is here…the government will ensure that the names are cleared at the earliest just the way the nine names were cleared for the apex court,” Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said on Saturday.SC Collegium recommends 4 names for elevation as Punjab and Haryana HC judgesThe latest recommendations were yet to be published on the top court’s website.Terming it “an ongoing process,” the CJI said, “We hope to live up to the herculean challenge of filling 41 per cent of vacancies existing in all the high courts.”Addressing a function organise by Bar Council of India (BCI) to facilitate him, the CJI said he expected that 90 per cent of the vacancies will be filled in another one month, adding, “It has been my endeavour to address the issues of vacancies in the highest judiciary on an urgent basis.”He also thanked his colleagues in the Collegium—Justice UU Lalit, Justice AM Khanwilkar, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice LN Rao for becoming “active and constructive partners in this endeavour”.The CJI’s revelation about recommendation of 82 more names comes close on the heels of 68 other names (44 advocates and 24 judicial officers) cleared by the Collegium on August 24 and September 1 for appointment as judges in 12 high courts. Twelve of the names were reiterations of names earlier recommended by the Collegium but sent back by the Government for reconsideration.The 68 recommendations were for the high courts of Allahabad, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab & Haryana, Calcutta, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Gauhati, Karnataka, Madras, Kerala and Jammu & Kashmir High Courts.The advocates recommended for elevation as Judges of the Punjab and Haryana High Court on September 1 are: Vikas Suri, Vinod Sharma (Bhardwaj), Pankaj Jain and Jasjit Singh Bedi. The Collegium had recommended the names of 13 advocates and three judicial officers for elevation to the Allahabad HC.CJI Ramana thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Law Minister Kiran Rijiju for expeditiously clearing nine names for elevation as judges of the Supreme Court which now has only one judicial vacancy.He recalled how Rijiju met him after taking over as the Law Minister and asked him about the problems faced by the Judiciary.“I told him (Rijiju) that pending vacancies are an issue and he cleared all the nine names (for the Supreme Court) within seven days. This was a record time,” the CJI said, adding, “I expect the same speed for the high court names recommended by us.”During the function, the CJI also felicitated the Law Minister and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.The Law Minister said when he met the CJI for the first time, he didn’t know him much and had heard about him only friends and the media.“In our first interaction I had realised that we have a CJI in whom we have full faith and trust…The Government will not only strengthen the independence of judiciary but also provide support to the same,” Rijiju said in the presence of Supreme Court judges, some lawmakers and a large number of office bearers of BCI and state bar councils.Rijiju also raised the issue of pendency of cases in subordinate courts. “When a person from rural area expects justice, he sells off everything…like land etc…If justice gets delayed then it’s a big question mark on all of us…Denying justice beyond three years is a real delay and by that time justice isn’t even needed.The CJI lamented that most of the students from rural areas were not getting into law schools and the legal profession sadly remained an urban profession.On poor representation of women in judiciary, Justice Ramana said, “After 75 years of independence one would be expect 50 per cent representation of women at all levels…but I must admit with great difficulty we have now achieved a mere 11 per cent of woman representation on the Bench of the Supreme Court.”Against a sanctioned strength of 34 judges, top court currently has 33 judges, including 4 women judges.Praising the CJI for expediting judicial appointments, Justice BR Gavai likened him with Sachin Tendulkar who was breaking records one after another.During his address the CJI said, “My roots are from the Bar. I enjoyed my life as member of the Bar more than a judge. This is my honest confession.”He recommended setting up a National Judicial Infrastructure Corporation to address the issues of buildings, toilets, lawyers’ chambers and other such issues. He said he has prepared a report which will be submitted to the Law Minister within a week. He also urged the Law Minister to take measure to ensure that subordinate court lawyers had proper access to internet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/collegium-recommends-82-more-names-for-appointment-as-hc-judges-306685

05-09-2021|| Noida||History beckons IAS officer Suhas Yathiraj at Tokyo Paralympics||History beckons Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer Suhas Lalinakere Yathiraj when he steps into the court for the badminton finals at the Paralympics in Tokyo on Sunday with a shot at the gold medal.Whether he wins or loses, the 38-year-old district magistrate of Gautam Buddh Nagar (Noida) will have scripted history as the first-ever IAS officer to win a medal at the Paralympics. Suhas, currently world No. 3 in SL4 category, has played three matches, including the semifinals on Saturday, in the ongoing Games. He has been at his dominating best against his rivals.While it took him less than 20 minutes to sail through the first two matches, Suhas outwitted Indonesia's Fredy Setiawan 21-9 21-15 in 31 minutes in the first semifinal.The 2007-batch IAS officer, with a leg impairment, will face top seed Lucas Mazur of France in the final on Sunday.“History under making! Suhas L Y, IAS, DM GB Nagar (Noida), UP, India in Men's singles para-badminton SL4 finals. He beats Indonesia's S Freddy 2-0 in semifinals. Now will be playing for Gold on September 5,” the IAS Association, a group of serving and retired administrative officers, tweeted.With the Karnataka-born engineer graduate making it to the final at the showpiece, internet users have been rallying support for him by trending the hashtag #Cheer4Suhas on social media platforms.Several of the residents' Whatsapp groups in Noida are also filled with congratulatory messages on their DM's sporting feat.Suhas, who graduated as computer engineer from NIT Karnataka with a distinction, has previously served as the district magistrate of Prayagraj, Agra, Azamgarh, Jaunpur, Sonbhadra districts.For the last one and a half years, he had been at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic management in Gautam Buddh Nagar since his appointment in the western UP district on March 30, 2020.Prior to his departure to Tokyo in the last week of August, Suhas, when asked about his badminton practice and work as DM, had told reporters, “I practice from 10pm for two hours after all the day's works are over. I have been managing my game and administrative duties this way for around six years now.” Suhas said his professional journey started in 2016 while he was the DM of Azamgarh district in eastern UP and a badminton championship was organized there.“I was a guest at the inauguration of the tournament and expressed desire to participate. Until then it was a hobby for me as I had been playing badminton since childhood. I got a chance to play there and defeated state-level players,” he had said.It was there, he said, the Gaurav Khanna, the current coach of the country's para-badminton team, spotted him and push-started his professional journey.In 2016 itself, he participated in the Asian Championship in Beijing and become the first non-ranked player to win the gold medal.More international recognition was awaiting him as he went on to win medals at BWF Turkish championship in 2017 and 2019 besides the latest, a gold, in Brazil in 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic started ravaging India and world.When his participation in the Tokyo Paralympics was confirmed in July, Suhas said the event was no doubt going to be a challenge and being the world number three in his category, he was hopeful for a medal.“Over the years, we have seen that small margins make the difference between winners and losers. I have lost games with a margin of millimeters and won by centimeters. When I compete in Tokyo, I know every player will be there hoping to win a medal,” Suhas told reporters.However, he said he was not putting himself under any pressure for it, as he cited the teaching of the Bhagvat Geeta.“Do your deed and you will get the results. I am not putting myself under any pressure. If God has brought me to this level, then I am going to put in all my efforts,” he said.  --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/history-beckons-ias-officer-suhas-yathiraj-at-tokyo-paralympics-306679
05-09-2021||New Delhi||EC announces bypoll in Bhabanipur assembly seat where WB CM Mamata Banerjee plans to contest||Bypoll to the Bhabanipur assembly seat in West Bengal, from where Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee plans to contest, would be held on September 30, the Election Commission announced on Saturday.Polling for three “deferred adjourned” elections—in two assembly seats of West Bengal and one of Odisha—will also be held on September 30.Elections in these seats—Samserganj and Jangirpur in West Bengal and Pipli in Odisha—could not be held due to various reasons, including the death of candidates during electioneering earlier this year.Counting on all four seats will take place on October 3. The EC said it has kept “much stricter” norms as an abundant caution to safeguard from the Covid-19 pandemic.The Bhabanipur bypoll will allow Mamata Banerjee a chance to become a member of the state legislative assembly.Banerjee had moved out of her traditional seat in Kolkata’s Bhabanipur to fight in Nandigram during the Assembly polls earlier this year but lost to his former close aide Suvendu Adhikari who contested on a BJP ticket.Adhikari is now the Leader of Opposition in the West Bengal Assembly.After the election results, Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, the TMC MLA from Bhabanipur constituency vacated the seat to allow Banerjee to contest from there. Banerjee had won from Bhabanipur twice since 2011.According to an Election Commission press note, the West Bengal chief secretary has informed that in view of administrative exigencies and public interest and to avoid a vacuum in the state, by-elections for Bhabanipur, from where CM Mamata Banerjee intends to contest elections, may be conducted.She has to become a member of the state legislature by November 5.Referring to its decision to hold assembly polls in Samserganj and Jangipur of West Bengal, and Pipli of Odisha where elections were earlier deferred, EC said since candidates and political parties for these three seats have already “availed” the campaign period from April 29 to May 3 this year, campaigning will only be allowed from September 20 in these seats.Based on inputs received from states where bypolls are due, EC said it has decided not to hold by-elections in other 31 assembly constituencies and three Parliamentary constituencies in view of the Covid situation, floods and festival season. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ec-announces-bypoll-in-bhabanipur-assembly-seat-where-wb-cm-mamata-banerjee-plans-to-contest-306659
05-09-2021||Washington||Taliban indicated they'd be reasonable in addressing Indian concerns: Foreign Secretary Shringla||India and the United States are closely watching Pakistan's actions in Afghanistan, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Friday.In the limited engagement that India has had with the Taliban, the new Afghan rulers have indicated that they would be reasonable in addressing New Delhi's concerns, the foreign secretary added.“Obviously, like us, they're also watching carefully and we have to watch Pakistan's actions with a fine tooth comb,” he told a group of Indian reporters at the end of his three-day official visit to Washington DC, adding that the US would have a wait-and-watch policy with regard to how the situation evolved in Afghanistan.India also has a similar policy. “That doesn't mean you don't do anything. It simply means that you have to... the situation is very fluid on the ground, you have to allow it to see how it evolves. You have to see whether the assurances that have been made publicly are actually maintained on the ground, and how things work out,” he said.“Our engagement with them (the Taliban) has been limited. It's not that we have (had) a robust conversation. But for whatever conversation we've had so far, they've been sort of. At least, the Taliban seem to indicate that they will be reasonable in the way they handle this,” Shringla said.He was responding to a question about the recent meeting that India's Ambassador in Qatar had with a senior Taliban leader in Doha.“In our statement, we have said that we have told them that we want them to be cognisant of the fact that there should be no terrorism that emanates from their territory directed against us, or other countries; that we want them to be mindful of the status of women, minorities and so on so forth. And, and I think they have, also, you know, made reassuring... from their side,” he said.The top Indian diplomat was in Washington DC for a series of meetings with his American counterpart and top officials of the Biden administration in addition to interaction with representations from the industry and think-tanks.On Thursday, he had called on the Secretary of State Antony Blinken.Observing that the situation in Afghanistan is very fluid and moving fast, Shringla said that both India and the US are keeping a close watch on it. “Look on 15th of August, you had a situation where (Afghan) President (Ashraf) Ghani suddenly left. You had the Taliban come in. The situation is moving so fast it's so fluid that is difficult to comment at this point of time on anything,” he said.
