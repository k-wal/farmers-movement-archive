Pompeo had arrived earlier in the day with US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper to hold the 2 + 2 Ministerial with Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. They will also call on PM Narendra Modi as well as meet NSA Ajit Doval.The two Foreign Ministers reviewed the progress in bilateral ties over the last four years and were satisfied that they have grown in virtually every domain, including trade, energy, defence and education. They also drew comfort from the expansion of consultations on foreign policy issues, including regional and multilateral. This has led to both sides working more closely in multilateral and plurilateral formats.Jaishankar stressed the uniqueness of Indo-US technology and talent flow connections and underlined that a knowledge economy with greater data sensitivity makes an even stronger case for collaboration. He pointed out that an innovation partnership is central to the future of Indo-US ties and policies must be accordingly supportive. Education is a special bond and both sides should work to expand it further, suggested Jaishankar.The two exchanged views on the current global situation and its contemporary challenges, including stability and security in Asia, and how best that can be ensured. They also touched on the specific issues that will be taken up in the 2+2 tomorrow, said the sources.Pompeo shared his government’s thinking on Afghanistan while Jaishankar highlighted India’s stakes and its continuing concern that decisions should be made by Afghans themselves without use of force.He also made clear that cross-border terrorism was completely unacceptable, claimed the sources. Both Ministers also discussed multilateral consultations and cooperation in the context of India’s forthcoming UNSC membership.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-pompeo-talk-maritime-security-supply-chains-161473

You people, on the other hand, cremate your dead on the side of a farm or Gangaji. Is this not unfair?”“Graveyards and cremation grounds should be as per population,” the Unnao MP said.There should not be any test of “our patience and decency”, he added.

26-10-2020||Sakra/Mahua/Mahnar/Kanti (Bihar)||Nitish Kumar faces protest at public meeting; slams RJD||A slipper was flung towards Chief Minister Nitish Kumar by some protestors while he was going towards his helicopter after completing speech at an election meeting in Sakra in Muzaffarpur district, but it missed the target.Police took four persons in custody on the charge of creating disturbances at the chief minister’s rally, police sources said.The Sakra incident is in the series of protests Kumar is facing during his rallies in different parts of the state.At many places, Kumar lost his cool and chided the protesters for “acting on behalf of political rivals” and telling them that nobody is bothered even if they don’t vote for him.Addressing rallies in Sakra and Mahua, Kumar hit out at the RJD for making “fake” promises during polls to “cheat” the people.Kumar has been deriding opposition chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav’s promise of providing 10 lakh jobs if voted to power.Kumar addressed rallies at Sakra and Kanti in Muzaffarpur district then he moved to neighbouring Vaishali district where he spoke at public meetings in Mahua and Mahnar assembly seats.Mahua constituency is in the news because Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav, who represented it in the outgoing assembly, has relinquished it and moved to Hasanpur constituency in Samastipur district.Mahnar too is in the media headlines because it includes the native place of veteran socialist leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, who had quit RJD before his death last month. His son Satya Prakash Singh has joined JD(U) headed by Nitish Kumar.“Some leaders are making lofty promises before polls to cheat people, they have no genuine interest in work, whereas we have translated all our promises into reality,” Kumar said taking a swipe at Lalu Prasad’s headed party while speaking at Mahua.Kumar said while the RJD cared for one family (of Prasad) and some caste and community but our successive governments have worked for promoting interests of all caste and creed.Like in the earlier rallies, Kumar reeled out data to underscore developmental records of the RJD during its 15-year rule and that of the NDA ministries for an equal duration after 2005.“For some family means wife, sons and daughters for me Bihar is the family for whom we work tirelessly,” the chief minister said, taking a jibe at his bete noire RJD supremo Lalu Prasad.He highlighted development work done in the last five years by executing “saat nishchay” (seven resolves) of good governance and promised to carry forward the work by implementing second part of the seven resolves which will include providing irrigation to every farm land.Accompanied by state minister Sanjay Kumar Jha, the chief minister reminded people of the “jungle raj” prevailing in the state during the RJD regime when crime was rampant and asserted how his government ended it and established “rule of law”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nitish-kumar-faces-protest-at-public-meeting-slams-rjd-161450

26-10-2020||---||PM Modi indicates $200-billion opportunity in Indian oil sector||New Delhi, October 26Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said India’s energy consumption will double over long term, providing ample opportunities for investments.“Leading global bodies project that world demand will contract for the next few years. But these agencies project India as a leading consumer,” pointed out the Prime Minister while speaking in virtual format at the Fifth India Energy Forum.Other top participants are Dan Brouillette and Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud, Energy Ministers of the US and Saudi Arabia, respectively, both of whom hope to benefit from India’s increased energy consumption.Washington has prioritised selling energy and weapons systems to India with energy related trade touching $ 8 billion last year. The subject will be on the table during the Indo-US two plus two talks on Tuesday, the US State Department has said. Saudi Arabia has traditionally been India’s biggest source of crude.PM Modi’s invitation to invest comes at a time when India may see total investments of over $ 200 billion in the sector. This includes $ 70 billion in gas infrastructure alone with US and European oil majors such as Total, Exxon Mobil, and Shell showing interest. In exploration and production, another $ 60 billion is envisaged. Plans to grow oil refining capacity to 450 million tonnes by 2025 from 250 million tonnes should see investment of $ 80 billion in the downstream segment.“Our energy sector will be growth-centric, investor friendly and environment conscious. Access to energy should be affordable and reliable,” said the Prime Minister.Lauding the country’s efforts in energy conservation, PM Modi said, “In the last six years, over 1.1 crore smart LED street lights were installed. This has enabled an estimated energy saving of 6 crore units per year. The estimated greenhouse gas emission reduction with this programme is over 4.5 crore tonnes of CO2 annually.”He also said India will always work keeping in mind global good. “We are well on track to meet the commitment we made to the global community.”OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo assured that his organisation is in agreement with the global consensus for the decarbonisation of the entire energy system by using technology and appropriate policies and decisions of governments and corporate organisations.Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan said India was focused on filling its strategic reserves and wanted partnerships to expand the storage capacity to 22 days of crude oil imports. The interest by Abdulaziz and Brouillette in the event, he claimed, was reflective of the growing strategic partnership with the US and Saudi Arabia. The Ministers said India was planning to develop energy corridors with neighbours and beyond.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-indicates-200-billion-opportunity-in-indian-oil-sector-161435

We are not interested in campaign, we are concerned about nepotism. We consider whole Bihar as one family but for few, only blood relatives are their family,” Nitish Kumar was quoted as saying at a rally today.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jail-is-the-right-place-for-nitish-chirag-paswan-161432

26-10-2020||---||This has never been the level of discourse: SC on Arnab FIRs||New Delhi, October 26Concerned over the declining standards of discourse on TV news channels, the Supreme Court on Monday called for responsible reporting even as it pointed out that some journalists needed more protection as they were targeted with greater intensity.“You can be a little old-fashioned with reporting. Frankly speaking, I cannot stand it. This has never been the level of discourse…There has to be responsibility in reporting…Peace and harmony of the society is what matters to the court...there are some areas where everyone must tread with caution,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told senior counsel Harish Salve who represented Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami.The Bench was hearing Maharashtra government’s appeal against the Bombay High Court’s order suspending probe into two FIRs against Goswami – one against his comments against Congress president Sonia Gandhi in connection with Palghar lynchings and the other for his alleged attempt to give a communal colour to a gathering of migrant workers at Bandra Railway station during COVID19 lockdown. The HC had said “prima facie no case was made out against him”.As senior advocate A M Singhvi assailed the high court’s June 30 order on behalf of the Maharashtra Government and said an impression should not go that some people are above the law, the Bench said some people were targeted with greater intensity and needed more protection.“While nobody is above the law, some people are targeted with higher intensity…some people need a higher degree of protection,” it noted.The top court asked the Maharashtra Government to submit a list of cases filed against Arnab Goswami and posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.Two FIRs were filed against Goswami—one in Nagpur, which was later transferred to N M Joshi Marg police station in Mumbai following directions from the Supreme Court and another at Pydhonie police station. The Nagpur FIR was about a news show aired on the channel on April 21 about the Palghar incident where two religious leaders and their driver were lynched.The Pydhonie case followed a show aired by Republic TV on April 29 where Goswami had referred to migrants gathering near a mosque outside the Bandra railway terminus during lockdown.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/this-has-never-been-the-level-of-discourse-sc-on-arnab-firs-161429

26-10-2020||New Delhi||October to be a Blue Moon month||The phrase ‘Once in a Blue Moon’ is aptly suited to the month of October this year, which will witness the rare occurrence of a second full moon, called the ‘Blue Moon’, on Saturday.The usual monthly lunar phenomenon is that every month has one full moon and a new moon. However, there are unusual occasions when the same month gets two full moons.October 1 saw a full moon and the next full moon falls on October 31, said Arvind Paranjpaye, director of Nehru Planetarium, Mumbai.“When there are two full moons in a calendar month, the second full moon is called the Blue Moon,” he said.There is a bit of mathematics involved in this.“Duration of a lunar month is 29.531 days or 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes and 38 seconds. Therefore, to have two full moons in a month, the first full moon should take place on 1st or 2nd of the month,” Paranjpaye explained.This extra time accumulates over the months. After about 30 months there will be one extra full moon in the year, Paranjpaye said.He added that it is also not possible to have a full moon in February as it has 28 days, and 29 days during a leap year.N Rathnashree, the director of Nehru Planetarium, Delhi said the term Blue Moon is a calendrical term.“It is not too common to have a Blue Moon in a month of 30 days,” she said.The last Blue Moon in a month with 30 days was on June 30, 2007 and the next one will be on September 30, 2050, Paranjpaye said.There were two Blue Moons in 2018. The first one was on January 31 and the second Blue Moon followed on March 31. “This was because the preceding month February had only 28 days,” Paranjpaye said.The next Blue Moon will be on August 31, 2023, he added.TV Venkateswaran, scientist with Vigyan Prasar, the communication wing of the Department of Science and Technology, and an astronomy enthusiast, said this phenomenon is largely restricted to the Gregorian calendar which is being used worldwide.“You will not see the phenomenon of two full moons in a month in Islamic or Tibetan calendars or the ones that are being followed in large parts of India as they are based on lunar movements,” Venkateswaran said.The phrase ‘Once in a Blue Moon’, denoting something which does not happen very often, came from this phenomenon, Venkateswaran added.

26-10-2020||New Delhi||Air pollution may hinder India’s fight against COVID-19, say scientists||The causal link between air pollution and COVID-19 cases is yet to be established conclusively but long-term exposure will certainly make people more vulnerable to lung infections, warn scientists as the skies over large parts of north India, including Delhi, turn smoky and the air quality deteriorates rapidly.Their concerns come amid several global studies pointing to the possible connection between higher air pollution levels and increased COVID-19 cases and deaths.A study by researchers at Harvard University in the US in September showed that an increase of only 1 microgram per cubic metre in PM 2.5 is associated with an 8 per cent increase in the COVID-19 death rate.“Given the current limited literature, the surge of PM2.5 level in Delhi may be associated with increased COVID-19 cases... Although the literature is relatively sparse at this stage,” Xiao Wu, corresponding author of the Harvard study, told PTI.He said the relationship between long-term air pollution and COVID-19 has been documented in many studies, which indicate that adverse health impacts of air pollution can make people prone to the infection or exacerbate the severity of COVID-19 symptoms once infected.This is interesting, especially considering COVID-19 causes viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and severe inflammation to the heart and circulatory system, the scientist said.Another study by the University of Cambridge in April found an association between living in an area of England with high levels of air pollution and the severity of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.“Based on our findings, I would expect to see an association between higher levels of air pollution in India and COVID-19 in the winter, similar with what we found in England,” said Marco Travaglio, corresponding author of the Cambridge study.“If the levels of air pollution have been consistently above the legal limits for several months or years before this coming winter, I would expect to see a relationship between those levels and COVID-19 burden across different parts of India in November and thereafter,” Travaglio told PTI.He noted that a key component of PM2.5 toxicity is its composition which may vary considerably between countries.“Nonetheless, the WHO legal limits for PM2.5 are currently set at 10 µg/m³ (microgrammes per cubic metre) annual mean. Levels beyond 500 µg/m³ are extremely high and may have considerable impact on people’s health in relation to COVID-19 but also beyond it,” said Travalgo.The level of small particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in Delhi have averaged around 180-340 µg/m³ in the past few weeks while that of bigger pollution particles (PM10) has hovered between 120 and 450 during the time.Long-term exposure to chronically high PM2.5 levels weakens the ability of the lungs to fend off infections, therefore making people more susceptible to COVID-19, the scientists said.In addition, studies from Italy have shown that traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the genetic material of the virus, can be found on pollution particles, meaning that increased air pollution may act as a vehicle to increase COVID-19 transmission in highly polluted places.The air quality in north India is expected to deteriorate further from November to February due to several factors such as stubble burning, festive fireworks and low wind speed conditions which lead to an uptick in vehicular and industrial pollution being trapped in the lower atmosphere.“In view of this evidence, high levels of PM2.5 in Delhi may lead to a higher number of COVID-19 cases,” Travalgo added.Studies in humans have shown that toxic air particles can penetrate airways and cause widespread infiltration of lung cells.This chronic state of inflammation may induce or aggravate health conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, experts said.Because these conditions have been widely found to be associated with increased risk of contracting COVID-19 or incurring into critical illness, it is likely that air pollution acts as a risk factor to increase the susceptibility to COVID-19.India has the world’s second-highest caseload of over 7.9 million and the third-highest death toll with more than 115,000 from the novel coronavirus.The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has warned that Delhi is likely to report around 15,000 COVID-19 cases daily in winter because of the prevalence of respiratory illnesses during this season that worsen the symptoms of the disease. On Sunday, the national capital recorded 4,136 fresh COVID-19 cases, the highest single-day spike in 38 days.D J Christopher, head of pulmonary medicine at the Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu, noted that the increased severe form of COVID-19 among patients would lead to increased ICU hospitalisations, thereby increasing the burden of the healthcare system.“The lung is the gateway to the body and takes the first impact from inhaled pollutants. It causes an inflammatory response which damages the lung and makes it more susceptible to infections,” Christopher told PTI.‘Let us hope the numbers are not so high. There is a chance of hospital beds getting filled and shortage of ICU beds,” he added.Prof Rajneesh Bhardwaj concurred, saying there is growing scientific evidence that airborne respiratory droplets carrying the virus travel and contaminate the air after an infected person coughs. He added that pollution may help this airborne droplet to remain suspended for a longer time and may increase the spread of COVID-19.“PM2.5 are finer particles which remain suspended in the air for a long time and hence droplet or viral particles can cling on to these particles to increase the risk. They may increase the number of cases as pollution increases especially with large PM2.5 levels,” Bhardwaj, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, told PTI.He said the government should make contingent plans to deal with an expected large number of cases and warned that any healthcare system can be overwhelmed by a larger number of cases.According to pulmonologist Anurag Agarwal, however, the relation between air pollution and COVID-19 cases is very complex. While in general high air pollution increases risk of respiratory infections, it is difficult to say much more, he said.“Studies finding more infections and deaths in areas with high pollution have tried to statistically adjust for higher population density in polluted cities. Such adjusted correlations are interesting but do not represent proof,” Agarwal, director of the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, told PTI.“Nevertheless, it is clear that air pollution is bad for health and COVID-19 is more dangerous in unhealthy people. So the message is clear - we must take steps to reduce air pollution for many reasons,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-pollution-may-hinder-indias-fight-against-covid-19-say-scientists-161422
26-10-2020||Hyderabad||New Andhra Pradesh industrial policy with incentives for SC/ST announced||The Andhra Pradesh government has come up with a new industrial policy (2020-23) that provides a special push to aspiring entrepreneurs, especially among the underprivileged communities, particularly scheduled castes (SC), scheduled tribes (ST).  This new industrial policy will provide an added focus on strengthening pre-establishment support, improving market linkages, credit facilities, and economic development with a focus on encouraging increased participation of SC/ST entrepreneurs by providing special incentives to promote the 362 manufacturing and 9,754 service sector activities among the socially disadvantaged communities. Launched by Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday, the policy aims at providing land under the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) guidelines. The APIIC allotment guidelines will be redesigned to provide at least 16.2% and 6% of the developed land reserved for SC/ST entrepreneurs in industrial parks.  The government also proposes establishing a dedicated SC/ST entrepreneur facilitation cell under YSR AP One at all-district industrial centres for handholding SC/ST entrepreneurs for quick grounding of the projects. Making the lives easier for the SC/ST entrepreneurs, the government has created a roadmap for training these entrepreneurs. Training on the sectors will be conducted through APSSDC skill colleges.  “Our new industrial development policy 2020-23 launched recently is centred on balancing growth across regions and communities. I firmly believe that this new policy is a vital step towards promoting entrepreneurship amongst the marginalised for inclusive growth and development,” the chief minister announced. On the occasion the minister for industries, Mekapati Goutham Reddy, said, “We intend to provide additional support to the weak and marginalised and hence have come out with this special industrial policy for SC/ST 2020-23. We are also providing seed capital assistance to support the entrepreneur start-up quickly and provide incentives on power, GST, and interest to reduce operating costs and provide support.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-andhra-pradesh-industrial-policy-with-incentives-for-sc-st-announced-161420
26-10-2020||Noida (UP)||Ransomware attack on restaurant chain Mithaas; probe on||Cyber criminals have allegedly hacked data of restaurant chain Mithaas with ransomware, with Noida police launching a probe into the matter, according to officials.An FIR was lodged at the Phase 3 police station on Sunday and investigation launched into the online crime, they said.The case comes within a fortnight of a similar incident with fast food and snack company Haldiram’s, whose servers were also attacked with ransomware, a virus used to encrypt data by hackers who then demand a ransom to decrypt it.In the complaint to police, a Mithaas representative said the hacking and ransomware implant on their company server took place in the afternoon of October 22.“… due to which all our data has been encrypted in a particular format due to which complete data has become useless for us and there is a ransomware screen in front which is asking us to contact them for further information of recovery,” the FIR stated.The company, which runs outlets in Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad and Meerut, said it has been provided a recovery link and the compromised system is located at their office in the industrial Sector 63 here.When contacted, a local police official told PTI, “The matter is under investigation.”Earlier this month, hackers allegedly stole crucial data of popular food and snack company Haldiram’s and demanded Rs 7,50,000 for releasing the information which included financial and sales details.The unidentified accused had hacked the server of the company based in the industrial Sector 62 here using ransomware, according to the officials. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ransomware-attack-on-restaurant-chain-mithaas-probe-on-161417
26-10-2020|| Patna||Campaign ends for first phase of Bihar assembly election||Curtain came down on Monday over campaign for 71 assembly segments of Bihar which go to polls on October 28, in the first phase of elections.Leading the NDA charge, Prime Minister Narendra Modi flew down to address as many as three rallies where he urged the voters to vote Chief Minister Nitish Kumar back to power.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, whose party is contesting the elections in alliance with Lalu Prasads RJD and three Left parties, also chipped in with two rallies.The BJPs quest for dominance over the states political scene, evident from a seat-sharing deal as part of which it clinched nearly as many constituencies as the JD(U)  its senior partner so far- resonated during the election campaign.Modi, as also other BJP star campaigners like Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and party president Jagat Ptakash Nadda repeatedly cited Ram temple at Ayodhya, scrapping of Article 370 and law against triple talaq as achievements of the government at the Centre and attacked the opposition for opposing these.The 69 years old Chief Minister, who is also the JD(U) president and is seeking a fourth term in power, carried out a strenuous campaign which began with a series of virtual rallies and has been followed by dozens of election meetings where he has been physically present, including two where he shared the stage with the Prime Minister.The normally unflappable Nitish Kumar made news on more than one occasion for losing his cool and snapping at protesters from the opposition camp who turned up at his rallies raising slogans.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, who has been named by his party as its Chief Ministerial candidate, also ran an indefatigable campaign which comprised rallies, video messages relayed through the social media and press conferences.Massive turnouts and enthusiastic response from the crowds at his rallies have been a surprise for political observers who have underscored that the ambience spoke more of the anti-incumbency than the appeal of the former Deputy CM.Another huge draw has been Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan who stunned all with his decision to go solo in the assembly polls.The 37 years old began campaigning actively rather late, only after the customary mourning after the death of his father Ram Vilas Paswan was over on October 20.The LJP chief has, thereafter, hit the streets with a vengeance canvassing for his candidates, a sizeable chunk of whom happen to be rebels from the BJP and the JD(U)  which he has vowed to dislodge from power in the state while proclaiming loyalty towards the saffron party.Other prominent leaders who have campaigned in the state so far include Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Smriti Irani, Congress leaders Raj Babbar and Shatrughan Sinha, BSP supremo Mayawati and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi.CPI rising star Kanhaiya Kumar also joined the campaign, mainly for candidates of the Left parties.Besides, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman flew down to release the BJP manifesto which promised, among other things, free corona vaccination.Many prominent leaders fell prey to the contagion while campaigning, which saw them among large numbers of people without necessary vaccinations. These included Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and former Union ministers Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Syed Shahnawaz Hussain.Altogether 1066 candidates are in the fray for the first phase of elections, 114 of them females.The voting in the first phase on Wednesday will decide fate of nearly half-a-dozen ministers of Nitish Kumar cabinet-Krishnandan Varma, Prem Kumar, Jay Kumar Singh, Santosh Kumar Nirala, Vijay Sinha and Ram Narayan Mandal.The 71 constituencies going to vote on October fall in six districts, including naxal-hit Gaya, Rohtas and Aurangabad.Among the prominent parties while RJD is contesting on 42 of the 71 seats in the first phase, JD(U) candidates are in 41 constituencies, BJP (29), Congress (21) and LJP nominees are in fray at 41 places.

26-10-2020||London||India ranks 6th most positive about teachers in 35-country survey||India ranks among the world's top 10 countries when it comes to valuing its teaching workforce, according to a new 35-country global survey-based report.‘Reading Between The Lines: What The World Really Thinks of Teachers’, released by the UK-based Varkey Foundation last week, found that India was sixth when it comes to people's implicit, unconscious and automatic views on the status of teachers in the country.The Implicit Teacher Status analysis, which finds China, Ghana, Singapore, Canada and Malaysia ahead of India, ranks countries by respondents' automatic impressions of teachers when asked to indicate as quickly as possible whether, for example, they think teachers are trusted or untrusted, inspiring or uninspiring, caring or uncaring, intelligent or unintelligent, among other word associations.“This report proves that respecting teachers isn't only an important moral duty – it's essential for a country's educational outcomes,” said Sunny Varkey, Founder of the Varkey Foundation and the Global Teacher Prize.“Since the coronavirus pandemic first emerged, we have seen 1.5 billion learners across the world impacted by school and university closures. In these unprecedented times, now more than ever it is necessary to do all we can to ensure young people throughout the world have access to a good teacher,” he said.The report, which builds on the data gathered by the Global Teacher Status Index (GTSI) 2018 – a 35-country survey conducted from 1,000 representative respondents in each of the countries – confirms the link between teacher status and pupil attainment.The new report seeks to explain for the first time why “Implicit Teacher Status” varies between countries.It finds that teachers generally enjoy higher status in richer countries, and in countries which allot a greater fraction of public funds to education.For instance, India's expenditure on education as a percentage of government spending is 14 per cent. In Italy, which ranks 24th for Implicit Teacher Status, by comparison, it is only 8.1 per cent, whereas in Ghana, which ranks second, it is 22.1 per cent.The report coincides with the announcement of the finalists for the 2020 Global Teacher Prize, which includes Ranjitsinh Disale – a teacher from a village in Maharashtra who is in the running for the USD 1-million annual prize, to be unveiled later this year.“We created the Global Teacher Prize, which shines a light on the extraordinary work that teachers do around the world, to inspire people to talk about the great work of teachers. We have seen teachers go above and beyond to keep young people learning all over the world amid the Covid pandemic,” added Varkey.As part of the new report's analysis, Professor Peter Dolton of the University of Sussex and Doctor Robert De Vries of the University of Kent reassessed the GTSI data to find a remarkably strong positive correlation between Implicit Teacher Status and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results.The PISA scores are significantly higher in countries where people implicitly view teachers more positively.

26-10-2020||Mumbai||In fresh war of words, Kangana calls Uddhav Thackeray ‘worst product of nepotism’||Hitting out at Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for his comments at a rally, actor Kangana Ranaut on Monday described him as “the worse product of nepotism” and said her state Himachal Pradesh is the land of the gods not ‘ganja fields’.The actor, who has been vocal about her criticism of the state government’s handling of the investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and labelled Bollywood a drug haven, lashed out against Thackeray a day after his Dussehra address.“People who have no means of livelihood in their home come to Mumbai and betray it. Calling Mumbai PoK is in fact the failure of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had said he would get back PoK into India,” Thackeray said on Sunday.Ranaut’s remark equating Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir had led to a furore, drawing the battle-lines between the Shiv Sena and her.“Those crying for justice for Bihar’s son are indulging in character assassination of Maharashtra’s son,” the chief minister said at the Sena’s annual Dussehra rally, breaking his silence on allegations against his son Aaditya Thackeray in the Rajput death case.Ranaut, known for her provocative statements, struck back in a series of tweets and a video on the social media platform and said Thackeray had abused her in his speech by calling her ‘namak haraam’.“As a chief minister, you have let down an entire state only because you are angry with a woman who is of your son’s age. You were very angry with me when I compared Mumbai with (Pok) after I was threatened because slogans of ‘Free Kashmir’ were raised there. Your ‘Sonia Sena’ had defended all that, that’s why I had compared it with PoK,” she said in the video.The actor said Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut had abused her and now it was Thackeray.“Shame on you, I am your son’s age. This is how you speak to a self-made single woman. Chief minister, you are the worse product of nepotism.”          She also took umbrage at Thackeray’s reference to ‘ganja fields’ in Himachal Pradesh and said it is actually ‘dev bhoomi’, land of the gods.              “What I want to tell you is: governments come and go. You are just a government servant and the people of Maharashtra are not happy with you. Governments come and go but if a person loses respect, he can’t get it back,” she said.The actor said opportunities that Mumbai offered belong to everyone and both the Himachal Pradesh and Mumbai were her homes.Ranaut has been in the headlines for locking horns with the Shiv Sena following Rajput’s death, be it for criticising Mumbai Police over its investigation into the case or lambasting the film industry for alleged drug use.Ranaut had again compared Mumbai with PoK after the Shiv Sena-led BMC demolished “illegal alterations” at her Bandra bungalow.She also said the Maharashtra government was trying to put her in jail after a complaint against her at a Mumbai court for “spreading hate and breaking the brotherhood, integrity of the country” through her provocative statements. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-fresh-war-of-words-kangana-calls-uddhav-thackeray-worst-product-of-nepotism-161403

Congress possesses both. Empty rhetoric of decency and democracy by the Mother is ‘complemented’ by live demonstrations of politics of hate, anger, lies and aggression by the son.

26-10-2020||New Delhi||India's COVID-19 fatality rate at 1.50 pc, lowest since Mar 22: Health ministry||India's COVID-19 fatality rate has dropped to 1.50 per cent, the lowest since March 22, the Union Health Ministry said on Monday crediting the focused efforts of the Centre, states and UTs on effective clinical management of hospitalised cases.There are 14 states and Union Territories including Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Bihar, Odisha, Assam and Kerala where the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) is lower than 1 per cent, the ministry said.With an effective containment strategy, aggressive testing and standardised clinical management protocols based on a holistic standard of care protocol across government and private hospitals, the number of new deaths has significantly dipped, it said.Less than 500 deaths (480) have been reported in a span of 24 hours in the country, according to the data updated at 8 am on Monday."India has one of the lowest fatality rates in the world. The case fatality rate is lowest since March 22 and is continuously declining," the ministry said as it underlined that the case fatality rate was 3.23 per cent on May 4.As part of the COVID-19 management and response policy, the Centre has had a sharp focus on not only containing the spread of the disease but to reduce deaths and save lives by providing quality clinical care to critical and severe patients, the ministry said.  Collaborative efforts of the Centre, states, and union territories have resulted in the strengthening of the health facilities across the country. Presently, 2,218 dedicated COVID hospitals are providing quality medical care, it said.As part of a unique initiative to build the capacities of ICU doctors in the clinical management of critical patients towards reducing fatalities, e-ICU has been started by AIIMS, New Delhi, it said. Twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays, tele/video-consultation sessions are held by knowledge and domain experts for doctors manning the ICUs in the state hospitals. These sessions started from July 8. Till date, 25 tele-sessions have been held, and 393 institutions across 34 states and UTs have participated in them.  Also, many states have conducted population surveys to map and identify the vulnerable population like the elderly, pregnant women and those with comorbidities.   This, with the help of technological solutions like mobile apps has ensured keeping the high-risk population under continuous observation, thus aiding early identification, timely clinical treatment and reducing fatalities. At the ground level, frontline health workers like ASHAs and ANMs have done a commendable job of managing the migrant population and to enhance awareness at the community level, the ministry said."As a result, there are 14 states and UTs with CFR lower than 1 per cent," the ministry underscored.  The ministry said that 59,105 new recoveries were added in a span of 24 hours as against 45,148 new infections being reported during the same period.     The total number of recoveries have crossed 71 lakh (71,37,228). A higher number of single day recoveries is also reflected in the continuous increase in the national recovery rate, which is 90.23 per cent at present, the ministry highlighted.  "India continues to report a trend of steadily decreasing active cases. Presently the active cases comprise merely 8.26 pc of the total caseload of the country standing at 6,53,717. This is the lowest since August 13 when the active cases were 6,53,622," the ministry said.  Seventy-eight per cent of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 states and a UT -- Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.  Karnataka has contributed the maximum to the single-day recoveries with more than 10,000 cases followed by Kerala with more than 7,000 cases.A total 45,148 new coronavirus infections were registered in a day in the country on Monday which is "the lowest since July 22 when 37,000 new cases were added", the ministry said.Eighty-two per cent of the new cases are from 10 states and a UT -- Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Odisha.     Kerala and Maharashtra contributed the maximum to the new confirmed cases with more than 6,000 cases each followed by Karnataka, Delhi and West Bengal with more than 4,000 cases, the ministry said.  Also, 480 case fatalities have been reported in 24 hours. Of these, nearly 80 per cent are concentrated in 10 states and a UT -- Maharashtra, West Bengal, Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.  More than 23 per cent of the new fatalities were reported from Maharashtra (112 deaths).     India's COVID-19 caseload mounted to  79,09,959 with  45,148  new infections being reported in a day, while the death toll climbed to 1,19,014 with 480 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am on Monday showed.

This is an issue that anyway should have been looked into...Everyone in this city is choking due to bad air,” the CJI said.On behalf of PIL petitioner Aditya Dubey, senior counsel Vikas Singh objected to Mehta’s submissions. "I don't understand the interest of Union of India in getting the order suspended. Ultimately, it is for the benefit of the people of Delhi,” he said."We think our own measure should be kept in abeyance. What is your problem? After all you are a PIL petitioner,” the CJI said, posting the matter for further hearing on October 29.The Supreme Court had on October 16 appointed Justice Lokur as a one-man committee to monitor the measures taken by governments of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi to prevent farmers from resorting to stubble-burning that turns the entire NCR into a virtual gas chamber during October-November.“It is necessary that there must be some monitoring of stubble-burning with a view to its prevention before it assumes abnormal proportions,” the Bench had said. It had directed chief secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi and EPCA to assist the committee in physical surveillance of fields where stubble was likely to be burnt and to devise additional means/methods for preventing it. "This order is not an indictment of any agency...We are only concerned that people in Delhi-NCR must be able to breathe clean and fresh air...," the CJI had said.Solicitor General Mehta had opposed Justice Lokur’s appointment, saying the government had reservations about the move as the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) appointed by the court was already doing the job.  The court had, however, clarified that appointment of the committee was not intended to dilute the powers and functions of any authorities such as EPCA, already created. The committee was required to visit the affected states and submit fortnightly reports to the top court at the initial stages or “as and when found necessary”. The Bench had asked heads of National Cadet Corps, National Service Scheme and Bharat Scouts and Guides to provide young force to the panel for locating stubble-burning and bringing it to notice of authorities concerned to prevent it.The order had come on a fresh petition filed by two students -- Aditya Dubey and Aman Banka -- who suggested that Justice Lokur could be assigned the task.  The top court was already seized of a PIL on air pollution in NCR. It has been asking states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi and the Centre to take measures to ensure farmers don't indulge in stubble-burning.Despite a ban on stubble-burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to do so because of lack of financial incentives to switch over to environment-friendly farm waste management practices.Last year, Punjab produced around 20 million tonnes of paddy residue of which farmers burnt 9.8 million tonnes while the figures in Haryana stood at 7 million tonnes and 1.23 million tonnes, respectively.On October 6, the top court had agreed to examine a suggestion that a portion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) should be withheld from farmers and released later only after a verification that they didn't burn stubble.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stubble-burning-sc-keeps-in-abeyance-its-order-appointing-justice-lokur-panel-161386
26-10-2020||New Delhi||SC rejects interim prayer of TN, AIADMK for 50 pc OBC quota in medical seats for 2020-21||The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the interim prayer of Tamil Nadu and the AIADMK for grant of 50 per cent quota in medical seats surrendered by the state in all-India quota for undergraduate, postgraduate and dental courses for the 2020-21 academic year.A bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi dismissed the interim prayer made in the pleas for implementation of 50 per cent quota for the current academic year.The Tamil Nadu government and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) have challenged the Madras High Court order of July 27 on the limited point by which it had cleared the decks for OBC reservation under the All-India Quota (AIQ) medical seats in non-central institutions, and gave the Centre three months’ time to take a decision on the percentage.The state government and the ruling AIADMK, in their limited point, had sought relief saying that the high court had not specified that the OBC quota should be implemented in the current academic year itself.The Centre has contended that it would not be practically feasible to implement the 50 per cent quota in the current academic year.The high court had held that on principle, there was no legal or constitutional impediment for extending the benefit of reservation to OBC in the state-surrendered AIQ seats of the UG and PG medical courses in the state-run medical colleges within Tamil Nadu, subject to any further directions or orders of the Apex Court.It had disagreed with the contention of the Medical Council of India that permitting reservation in the AIQ seats would compromise merit and said the argument got diluted as the NEET examinations are now clearly designed to allow only such candidates to be admitted, who secure minimum merit.“Thus, application of any reservation rule, be at the instance of the state-specific law or as per any reservation policy framed by the Central Government for AIQ seats, will not affect merit,” the high court had said.It had, however, restrained itself from passing a mandamus against the Centre to provide the reservation as it relates to a policy decision.On July 13, the top court had asked the Madras High Court to decide the pleas, including one filed by Tamil Nadu government, against the Centre’s decision not to grant 50 per cent quota to OBCs in the medical seats surrendered by the state in all-India quota for undergraduate, postgraduate and dental courses in 2020-21.The state government had moved the Supreme Court on July 2 seeking a direction to the high court to expeditiously decide its plea. The state government and various political parties have challenged the Centre’s decision not to grant 50 per cent reservation to OBCs as per the Tamil Nadu law.Some of the petitioners, in their interim prayers before the High Court, had sought to stall the ongoing admissions for PG medical courses. The pleas had alleged that the Centre also did not follow its own policy of 27 per cent reserved seats for OBCs under the 2006 Act.

26-10-2020||New Delhi||SC asks petitioner seeking CBI probe into Disha Salian's death to approach Bombay HC||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain a petition seeking a CBI probe into the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput's former manager Disha Salian and asked the petitioner to approach the Bombay High Court.“Why don't you go to the Bombay High Court? They know the case and they will take an informed decision and then you may come here if there is any difficulty,” a Bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told petitioner's counsel Vineet Dhanda.The top court pointed out that the Bombay High Court was already seized of several such cases, and that it was familiar with the case.The petitioner can come back to the top court "if not satisfied with the High Court order," the Bench noted.Disha (28) had died on June 8 after falling off the 14th floor of a residential building in Malad West in Mumbai.Rajput (34) allegedly committed suicide on June 14. He was found hanging at his Bandra house under mysterious circumstances. The Mumbai Police said it was a suicide and that he was suffering from depression.However, the Supreme Court on August 19 ordered a CBI probe into the unnatural death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, saying, “A fair, competent and impartial investigation is the need of the hour.”Alleging a link between the two unnatural deaths, petitioner Puneet Kaur Dhanda had pointed out that both died under suspicious circumstances and at the "peak of their successful professional career.While demanding a CBI probe into both the cases, Dhanda wanted the top court to summon records from the Mumbai Police on the status of the investigation into Disha's death.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-petitioner-seeking-cbi-probe-into-disha-salians-death-to-approach-bombay-hc-161383

26-10-2020||Satya Prakash||SC stays MP HC order asking political parties to conduct virtual campaign for bypoll||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 26The Supreme Court on Monday stayed a Madhya Pradesh High Court order which restricted candidates and political parties to virtually hold poll campaigning during the Assembly by-election for 28 seats in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.Staying the October 20 order of the Madhya Pradesh High Court, a Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar asked the Election Commission to take cognisance of all issues raised in the petitions before the high court.The order came on the petitions filed by the EC and BJP candidate from Gwalior Pradyumn Singh Tomar challenging the high court’s order.The poll panel had contended that the conduct and management of the elections were overseen by it, and Article 329 of the Constitution put an express bar on judicial interference in midst of the electoral process.As senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi submitted that the high court’s order interfered with the electoral process and paralyses the entire exercise, the Bench said the poll panel should have been proactive.On behalf of Tomar, senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi pointed out that with barely five days left for voting, there was a need to increase the voting hour by three to four hours. But the Bench chose to ignore it.In his petition, Tomar submitted that the impugned HC order violated his right to conduct election campaign through physical gatherings as permitted by the EC, the Central Government and the state authorities.A former Congress MLA, Tomar is currently the Energy Minister in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government.He had urged the Apex Court to stay the high court’s order that was passed on a PIL highlighting the violation of physical-distancing norms during COVID-19 and alleged inaction on the part of the state authorities against political parties and leaders.Maintaining that the Right to Health took precedence over the right to campaigning, the high court had directed political parties to conduct the election campaign by virtual mode without physical gathering.The high court had also restrained the district magistrates from permitting physical campaigning unless it was proved that conducting virtual election campaign was not possible and the Election Commission approved it in writing.The high court had directed Datia and Gwalior district authorities to lodge FIRs against former chief minister Kamal Nath and Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar for alleged violation of the COVID-19 norms during the poll campaigns.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-stays-mp-hc-order-asking-political-parties-to-conduct-virtual-campaign-for-bypoll-161367

26-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||Lots at stake for Nadda, Nitish as Bihar poll kicks off on Wednesday||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 26On Wednesday when Bihar begins the process to elect the new government, it will also test the political acumen of both BJP president JP Nadda and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar. While Nadda is yet to deliver a poll victory after taking charge as the party chief, Nitish has been battling 15 years of anti-incumbency. Seventy-one Assembly constituencies across 16 districts will go to the polls in the first phase on October 28. While the elections are a testing time for all stakeholders, observers say young players like RJD's Tejashwi Yadav and LJP's Chirag Paswan, with years by their side, would probably have less to lose and more to gain.Also read: The more Congress hates PM, the more people support Modi: NaddaFor Nadda, who was born in Bihar, these elections are a matter of prestige. Just like Nitish, who many believe could be playing his last innings in the state politics.Bihar also happens to be Nadda’s ‘karmbhoomi’, the place where he honed his politics as a student leader before stepping into active politics. While as the party president he has been involved in all decisions from seat distribution to strategising, sources say he is burning the midnight oil trying to micro-manage other issues too.Nadda is confident that the NDA will form the next government, but Bihar is a test that he must pass. He is yet to deliver a win to his party since stepping into the top seat in January 2020. These are Nadda's second elections, the first bring in Delhi where the BJP suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Aam Aadmi Party. Nadda must win the Bihar poll to redeem himself after the Delhi loss, say observers. Incidentally, the BJP also lost Bihar and Delhi in 2015 when Amit Shah was the president despite a landslide in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.As far as Nitish Kumar is concerned, the fatigue in him and against him is all too obvious. Sources say the BJP-JD(U)-HAM(S)-VIP alliance is counting heavily on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to pull off Bihar.In order to divert attention from the 15-year incumbency being faced by Nitish Kumar, the BJP is trying to convert the elections into Modi versus the rest with a heavy dose of BJP-style "nationalism" and other staple seasoning like "development and double engine growth in NDA" and "anti-national stance of others".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lots-at-stake-for-nadda-nitish-as-bihar-poll-kicks-off-on-wednesday-161359

26-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘very poor’; stubble-burning contribution may increase||The national capital’s air quality was recorded in the ‘very poor’ category on Monday morning and the share of stubble burning in the city’s PM2.5 pollution is likely to increase, according to a central government agency.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the wind direction and the wind speed is favourable for the transport of the pollutants from farm fires in Haryana, Punjab, and other neighbouring regions to Delhi.The contribution of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was 19 per cent on Sunday, it said.The City recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 343 at 10 am on Monday. The 24-hour average AQI was was 349 on Sunday.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Calm winds and low temperatures allow accumulation of pollutants while favourable wind speed help in their dispersion.                     The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System For Delhi said the predominant surface wind direction is northwesterly with wind speed up to 12 kmph, favourable for transport of pollutants from farm fires.A large number of farm fires were observed over Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which is likely to impact Delhi-NCR’s air quality, it said.The air quality warning system said the ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – is likely to be 15,000 metre square per second on Monday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.                 A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.

After completion of the first and second phase of the trial with demonstrable safety profile and immunogenicity, the large-scale efficacy trial involving thousands of volunteers has been planned now, Dr Rao said.Dr Rao, who is the head of the Preventive and Therapeutic Clinical Trial Unit (PTCTU), said during this phase the age limit and eligibility/ screening criteria would be relaxed and several volunteers who are otherwise apparently healthy would be recruited for the trial.Like the previous phases, half of the volunteers would receive placebo and the remaining half would be administered COVAXIN in this phase. Even health care workers would be recruited for the trial. The volunteers would be followed up over a considerable period to look at the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing the development of the Corona disease, he said.Rao said there had been a huge response and enthusiasm among people who had offered themselves to be volunteers for the trial.

26-10-2020||New Delhi||Amazon wins interim relief after Future-Reliance deal put on hold||Amazon.com Inc on Sunday won an interim award against its partner Future Group selling retail business to Reliance Industries Ltd for Rs 24,713 crore after a Singapore-based single judge arbitration panel put the deal on hold.Amazon, which had agreed to purchase 49 per cent of one of Future's unlisted firms last year with the right to buy into flagship Future Retail Ltd after a period of three years to 10 years, had dragged Future to arbitration after the indebted Kishore Biyani group firm signed pact to sell retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance.Passing an interim award in favour of Amazon, V K Rajah asked the Future group to put the deal on hold and said that the deal cannot go through until it finally decides the matter, sources with direct knowledge of the development said.Confirming the development, an Amazon spokesperson said that the arbitration panel has granted the reliefs sought by it and expect an expeditious conclusion of the arbitration process."We welcome the award of the Emergency Arbitrator. We are grateful for the order which grants all the reliefs that were sought. We remain committed to an expeditious conclusion of the arbitration process," the Amazon spokesperson said.Amazon believes Future Group violated the contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance.The deal would have helped Reliance almost double its footprint as India's largest retailer.With the dispute, Amazon is drawing the battle lines with Reliance in the race for India's estimated USD 1 trillion retail market, where online shopping is gaining ground. It needs the Indian partner to strengthen its foothold after becoming the authorized online sales channel for Future Retail's stores that sell everything from groceries to cosmetics and apparel.A source said a three-member arbitration panel, with Future and Amazon appointing one representative each and a third member being a neutral umpire, would decide on the dispute in 90 days. Amazon team was represented by Gopal Subramanium, Gourab Banerji, Amit Sibal and Alvin Yeo. While Future Retail side was represented by advocate Harish Salve, sources said. Earlier on October 16, the hearing was concluded by the arbitration panel at Singapore International Arbitration Centre. Amazon has slapped a legal notice on Future Group, alleging that the retailer's Rs 24,713 crore asset sale to Reliance Industries violated an agreement with the e-commerce giant and dragged the Future group firm into arbitration. Earlier on August 29, 2020, the Future group had announced sale of its retail, wholesale and logistic etc to Reliance Retail Ventures Limited, the retail arm of the Reliance Industries. Amazon, last year, had bought a 49 per cent stake in one of Future's unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd, with the right to buy into flagship Future Retail after a period between three and 10 years. Future Coupons owns a 7.3 per cent stake in Future Retail. The tussle between Future and Amazon comes at a time when Reliance has been bolstering its position in the country's retail segment. Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd - run by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani - has been on a fund raising spree and since September, it has raised Rs 37,710 crore crore by selling stake in its retail arm. RRVL, operates India's largest, fastest-growing and most profitable retail business spanning supermarkets, consumer electronics chain stores, cash and carry wholesale business, fast-fashion outlets and online grocery store JioMart. It operates about 12,000 stores in nearly 7,000 towns, with 640 million footfalls across core categories of grocery, consumer electronics and apparel. Revenues of Reliance Retail in FY20 stood at Rs 1.63 lakh crore. The investments equip Reliance Retail with funds to compete in both offline and online formats. The investments come as the country's retail sector prepares for the upcoming festival season and would help Reliance to launch an assault on rivals such as Walmart-owned Flipkart and Amazon.

Today’s discussions will add new vigour to India-US defence relations & mutual cooperation,” he said in the tweet.In its statement, the defence ministry said Singh and Esper reviewed bilateral defence cooperation spanning military-to-military cooperation, secure communication systems and information sharing and defence trade.“Both the Ministers expressed satisfaction at the close engagements between the respective Armed Forces. They discussed potential new areas of cooperation, both at service to service level and at the joint level,” it said.The ministry said the two ministers also called for continuation of existing defence dialogue mechanisms during the pandemic, at all levels, particularly the Military Cooperation Group (MCG).They also discussed requirements of expanding deployments of liaison officers in each other’s facilities.It said the US Secretary of Defence welcomed Australia’s participation in the upcoming Malabar naval exercise.Singh also highlighted recent reforms in the defence manufacturing sector and invited US companies to make best use of the liberalised policies and the favorable defence industry ecosystem in the country.Apart from strengthening military-to-military cooperation and boosting partnership in the Indo-Pacific region, the issue of expeditious supply of contracted weapon systems by the US to India figured prominently in the deliberations.Earlier, Singh received Esper at the lawns of the South Block in Raisina Hills, reflecting the importance India is attaching to the visit by the two top officials of the Trump administration.

An estimated Rs 500 odd will be spent on vaccination of each person, Sarangi told reporters after addressing a campaign meeting for the November 3 Assembly bypoll in Balasore.Modi had in a televised address to the nation on October 20 said that Indian scientists are in the process of developing several vaccines that are at different stages of clinical trials and the results seem encouraging.Sarangi, the union minister of state for animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries and micro, small and medium enterprises spoke in reply to question raised by Odisha Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister, R P Swain.Swain had earlier in the day sought clarification from Dharmendra Pradhan and Sarangi, the two union ministers from Odisha questioning them for their silence on their party BJP's stand on free COVID-19 vaccination for the people of the state along the lines of the one being promised in Bihar.The governments of Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Assam and Puduchchery have already announced free of cost COVID vaccines for the people of their states, while Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has demanded free vaccine for all citizens across the country.Swain had tweeted: "I am asking questions to two Odisha union ministers from Balasore soil to clarify as to why the people of the state will not get free of cost COVID vaccine.The union ministers should clarify BJPs stand on the corona vaccination in Odisha.On the state governments steps for vaccination, Swain said it has signed an agreement with a vaccine manufacturer and is committed to extend the facility to all people of the state.He, however, did not say whether the state government will provide the vaccine to the people free of cost.BJP deputy leader in Odisha Assembly Bishnu Charan Sethi said the Centre has been supporting  Odisha fully during the pandemic and has granted Rs 22,000 crore for the purpose."But large-scale lapses have been detected in the utilisation of the fund," he alleged.

While purchasing items from the market, we have to accord priority to local products,” PM Modi said in his monthly “Mann ki Baat”.Recalling the lockdown times, he said it was during the period that people came to know members of the society like sanitation workers, domestic helps, local daily needs vendors, security guards without whose services life would have been miserable. He urged people to take these people along during the festivities and treat them as members of own family.At the same time, he said, “Citizens must also think of brave heart soldiers who are stationed on the borders in the line of duty, even during these festive times.”“We have to celebrate our festivals bearing them in mind. I would also like to assure our brave soldiers that despite they being away at the borders, the entire country is with them, wishing well for them. I also salute the sacrifice of those families, whose sons and daughters are on the border today. I express gratitude to each and every person who is away from home and family on account of discharging duty to the country in one way or the other,” he added.“The world is taking note of India’s products,” he said, citing the example of rising popularity of khadi.PM Modi talked about khadi being popularised in Mexico’s Oaxaca by a person named Mark Brown, who has made it a brand there.Highlighting the growing popularity of khadi, he said khadi masks had become popular during Covid-19 times and that on Gandhi Jayanti, the khadi store in Delhi’s Connaught Place had witnessed purchases of over Rs 1 crore on October 2.Interspersing his address with brief chats, PM Modi touched upon various initiatives like popularising book reading by enterprising people or how Manzoor Ahmed Alai, an entrepreneur in Pulwama, became one of the largest suppliers of pencil slats in the country.He also talked about indigenous sports and pointed to the growing popularity of Mallakhambh, a traditional Indian exercise module on a pole, in the US, Germany, Poland and Malaysia.

Wavel Ramkalawan, whose grandfather came from Gopalganj, Bihar, defeated incumbent Danny Faure.Ramkalawan, who had remained underground for some time during the one-party rule by Faure’s predecessors, is opposed to the “Assumption agreement” for handing over an island to India. In a reflection of the changing political climate in the country, a four-party parliamentary majority led by Ramkalawan’s Linyon Demokratik Seselwa (LDS), has refused to ratify the agreement.Now with the priest-politician as President, the agreement signed during PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Seychelles in 2015 may have to be drastically revised. This is especially so because the new President is widely expected to be politically strengthened when the next parliamentary elections take place. The LDS, which came to power for the first time since independence in 2016, is poised for a comfortable majority in Parliament.India was so keen on finalising the lease of Assumption Island that External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s last engagement before the lockdown was with his Seychelles counterpart Barry Faure. Seychelles politicians across ranks, including Faure, are clear that the agreement cannot proceed without the parliamentary nod.According to Seychelles media, as leader of the opposition, Ramkalawan had been explicit about his party’s unwillingness to ratify the pact on environmental grounds because Assumption Island is close to a UNESCO world heritage site that is home to the world’s largest population of giant tortoises.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-origin-priest-is-seychelles-president-161199

Recent evidence shows that over the nearly three decades, there has been a gradual increase in the use of permanent methods of family planning among couples with only daughters.The proportion of couples with only two daughters who accepted sterilisation more than doubled from 16% in National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-1 (1992-1993) to 33.6% in NFHS-4 (2015-2016).Among couples with only three daughters, the proportion on sterilisation rose from 20% to 34%.New trends found by researchers from the International Institute of Population Sciences indicate that while son’s preferences still dominate, the previous rigidity around the mindset is waning even in high son preference states of Punjab, Haryana and Maharashtra.“The rise in the percentage of married couples having only daughters and yet adopting permanent methods of family planning has increased indicating reduced historical aversion to daughters-only families and weakening patriarchal norms,” say researchers who, apart from looking at national data, also studied district health statistics for three high son preference states of Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and three low son preference states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal.Results show that the proportion of currently married couples with only one child (daughter) who adopted sterilization between two rounds of district survey rose from 1.5% to 3.1% in Punjab, 0.7% to 5.1% in Haryana and 5.4% to 10.3% in Maharashtra.Corresponding rise for couples with two children (daughters) rose from 4.7 to 7.9% in Punjab; 2.9 to 9.9% in Haryana and 25 to 36% in Maharashtra; and three daughters rose from 8.8 to 13.1% in Punjab; 4.6 to 13.1% in Haryana and 36.4 to 47.6% in Maharashtra.Among couples who have either sterilised or do not want more children with only one daughter, the increase (among high son preference states) has been the largest for Haryana (20%) followed by Maharashtra (10%) and Punjab (8%).In Punjab, 21 per cent currently married couples with one daughter have either sterilised or do not want more children. Gurdaspur, Kapurthala top in PunjabPanchkula best in Haryana||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/acceptance-for-daughters-growing-shows-survey-161200

Before the issue could be discussed further, the focus shifted on Covid,” Bhagwat said, asserting “no Indian citizen is threatened by the CAA”.Without mentioning the Hathras incident, he criticised Opposition parties and the “tukde, tukde gang” for “trying to divide and weaken the Indian society by creating social strife”. “There are such powers in the world and have their agents in India. They use the diversity in India to incite strife,” he said.“Members of this conspiratorial gang instigate and promote slogans like ‘Bharat tere tukde honge (Bharat will be disintegrated)’. An unusual blend of political interest, separatist and fundamentalist tendencies, hatred of Bharat, and a quest for global dominance is working to dampen the unity of our country,” said the Sangh supremo.‘RSS supremo scared to face truth’Reacting to Mohan Bhagwat’s assertion that India needed to be militarily prepared, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the Sangh supremo knew the truth that China had grabbed Indian land but was scared to face it. “Deep inside, Mr Bhagwat knows the truth.

The Army is exploring options wherein a certain number of troops stationed in lower altitudes are always acclimatised for high altitude operations or the period can be reduced significantly through the use of medications. Acclimatisation is critical because low oxygen levels and inclement climate can have adverse physiological, psychological, biochemical and hormonal effects on the human body.Both, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as well as the Directorate General Armed Forces Medical Services (DGAFMS) have been carrying out multi-faceted research in this regard.A recent study by Army medical specialists suggested that troops can be inducted from the sea level to high-altitude areas in as little as four days if they are administered certain preventive medications, like Acetazolamide and Dexamethasone.Another option is simulation of high altitude conditions at lower levels where earmarked formations are based. Atmospheric pressure and oxygen levels prevalent in high altitude can be simulated in rooms to which troops can be exposed for the required period.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-takes-steps-to-cut-acclimatisation-period-161203
