However, the airlines were allowed to operate not more than 33 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights. On June 26, this was increased to 45 per cent and on September 2, it was further increased to 60 per cent. On November 11, it was increased to 70 per cent. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-increases-domestic-flights-cap-from-70-pc-to-80-pc-of-pre-covid-levels-179502
03-12-2020||Washington||Indian economy is gradually recovering: IMF||India’s economy, severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic, is gradually recovering, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday.India’s economy recovered faster than expected in the September quarter as a pick-up in manufacturing helped GDP clock a lower contraction of 7.5 per cent and held out hopes for further improvement on better consumer demand.“India has indeed been severely affected by the pandemic but is gradually recovering,” IMF chief spokesperson Gerry Rice told reporters.Fiscal, monetary, and financial sector measures announced to date provided much-needed support to the economy, including businesses, agriculture, and vulnerable households, Rice said in response to a question on the IMF’s assessment of India’s economy during the coronavirus pandemic.“To further support growth, we believe the Indian authorities should prioritize swift implementation of the existing support programs and may need to consider expanding their scope, as warranted,” Rice said.In her address to the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), the ministerial-level committee of the IMF, through video conference, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that a V-shaped pattern of recovery is being seen in several high-level indicators. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-economy-is-gradually-recovering-imf-179501

They are already bound by the disqualification in terms of the RPA as well as various directions and precedents as laid down by this court from time to time.” The Centre said in an affidavit filed in response to a PIL by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay in the Supreme Court.The Centre’s stand is at variance with that of the Election Commission which had earlier supported the demand to keep convicted politicians out of electoral politics.According to Section 8(3) of the Representation of People Act, 1951,“A person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years… shall be disqualified from the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since his release.”Upadhyay wanted that the six-year ban under Section 8(3) of the RPA should be replaced with a lifetime ban and such convicted politicians should also be debarred from forming political parties or holding party positions.However, the Centre said, “There is no apparent discrimination between public servants and elected representatives in so far as any offence committed by either are concerned. Both are held under Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as other laws in force…The elected representatives are ordinarily bound by the oath they take to serve citizens.”“The elected representatives are ordinarily bound by oath that they have taken to serve the citizens of their constituency in particular and country in general. Their conduct is bound by propriety and good conscience,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-opposes-life-ban-on-convicted-politicians-179497

03-12-2020||New York||15-year-old Indian-American Gitanjali Rao named first-ever TIME ‘Kid of the Year'||15-year-old Indian-American Gitanjali Rao, a "brilliant" young scientist and inventor, has been named by TIME magazine as the first-ever ‘Kid of the Year' for her "astonishing work” using technology to tackle issues ranging from contaminated drinking water to opioid addiction and cyberbullying."The world belongs to those who shape it. And however uncertain that world may feel at a given moment, the reassuring reality seems to be that each new generation produces more of what these kids…have already achieved: positive impact, in all sizes,” Time said.Rao was selected from a field of more than 5,000 nominees as TIME's first-ever Kid of the Year. She was interviewed by actor and activist Angelina Jolie for the TIME special.“Observe, brainstorm, research, build and communicate,” Rao told about her process during a virtual talk with Jolie from her home in Colorado.She spoke about her “astonishing work using technology to tackle issues ranging from contaminated drinking water to opioid addiction and cyberbullying, and about her mission to create a global community of young innovators to solve problems the world over.“Even over video chat, her brilliant mind and generous spirit shone through, along with her inspiring message to other young people: don't try to fix every problem, just focus on one that excites you,” Time said.“If I can do it,” she said in the interview, “anybody can do it.” Rao said her generation is facing many problems that they have never seen before.“But then at the same time, we're facing old problems that still exist. Like, we're sitting here in the middle of a new global pandemic, and we're also like still facing human-rights issues. There are problems that we did not create but that we now have to solve, like climate change and cyberbullying with the introduction of technology,” she said.“I think more than anything right now, we just need to find that one thing we're passionate about and solve it. Even if it's something as small as, I want to find an easy way to pick up litter. Everything makes a difference. Don't feel pressured to come up with something big,” she said.When asked when she knew that science was her passion, Rao said she always wanted to put a smile on someone's face.“That was my everyday goal, just to make someone happy. And it soon turned into, How can we bring positivity and community to the place we live?” Rao added that she doesn't look like "your typical scientist. Everything I see on TV is that it's an older, usually white man as a scientist. It's weird to me that it was almost like people had assigned roles, regarding like their gender, their age, the colour of their skin."My goal has really shifted not only from creating my own devices to solve the world's problems, but inspiring others to do the same as well. Because, from personal experience, it's not easy when you don't see anyone else like you. So I really want to put out that message: If I can do it, you can do it, and anyone can do it," she said.She said when she was in second or third grade, she started thinking about how she can use science and technology to create social change. She said she was 10 when she told her parents that she wanted to research carbon nanotube sensor technology at the Denver Water Quality Research Lab.When asked by Jolie if Rao does things that kids her age do, she said “actually I spend more time doing 15-year-old things during the quarantine. I bake an ungodly amount. It's not good, but it's baking. And, like, it's science too.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/15-year-old-indian-american-gitanjali-rao-named-first-ever-time-kid-of-the-year-179494
03-12-2020||Mumbai||Arnab Goswami seeks stay to filing of chargesheet in suicide case||Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami on Thursday filed an urgent application before the Bombay High Court, seeking a stay to the filing of chargesheet and further proceedings in the 2018 Anvay Naik abetment to suicide case.Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, who ordered re-investigation by the state CID, had no power to do so as the previous probe by the Alibaug police in Raigad district had been closed last year, it said.Goswami, one of the accused in the case which is being re-investigated, was arrested by Alibaug police last month before the Supreme Court granted him bail.Stating that his arrest on November 4 was illegal, Goswami in his plea also urged the HC to transfer the investigation to the CBI or any other independent agency.The Maharashtra government in May this year ordered a reinvestigation out of vendetta, the petition alleged."The Home Department...or any other government authority does not have the power to order a reinvestigation or fresh investigation in a case where an `A summary' report (clsoure report) is filed and the same is accepted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate," the petition said.Deshmukh announced at a press conference in November that a "strong chargesheet" would be filed against Goswami, which showed that the state machinery was interfering in the case with a "malafide premeditated diktat to the law and order officers", it said.The re-investigation could not have been ordered without a judicial sanction and hence, the CID probe is illegal and "abuse of the process of law", Goswami said.The announcement of reinvestigation reeked of the "malice, spiteful nature and vendetta of the political dispensation" in Maharashtra, the petition claimed.Goswami also sought permission to amend his main petition seeking quashing of the FIR. He wanted to add arguments against the state home department's letter of May 26 which announced re-investigation and about which he learnt only last month, he said.Interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother Kumud Naik committed suicide in 2018, allegedly because of non-payment of dues by firms of Goswami and two others.After the alleged abetment to suicide case was reopened, Goswami and other two were arrested on November 4, but the Supreme Court granted them bail on November 11. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arnab-goswami-seeks-stay-to-filing-of-chargesheet-in-suicide-case-179492
03-12-2020||New Delhi||Business of adulteration sophisticated, brands confuse consumers with language jugglery: CSE||A day after reporting adulteration in the honey sold by major brands in the country, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Thursday said any claim by these companies of meeting all Indian standards “holds limited value” and was “jugglery” of language.The CSE was responding to statements by Dabur and Patanjali claiming that the honey sold by them meets all domestic testing standards.“That is what we have been saying—that the business of adulteration is sophisticated. The Indian labs testing for parameters set by the FSSAI could not detect this evolved adulteration,” the environment watchdog said.“We have also noted that Dabur is constantly changing the language on its claims regarding NMR tests. In earlier advertisements, it has said ‘NMR tested, pure honey’; as of today—after the release of the CSE investigation—Dabur is claiming ‘source NMR tested’,” said CSE director general Sunita Narain.“Is this jugglery another attempt to confuse the consumer?” she asked.The Centre for Science and Environment had on Wednesday claimed that honey sold by several major brands in India has been found to be adulterated with sugar syrup.In a study conducted by it, the CSE’s food researchers selected 13 top and smaller brands of processed and raw honey being sold in the country to check their purity. They found 77 per cent of the samples adulterated with the addition of sugar syrup.Out of the 22 samples checked, only five passed all the tests. The CSE also specified the names of the brands. Dabur and Patanjali were among those that failed the NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) test.Both companies have questioned the not-for-profit environment organisation’s claims that the varieties of honey sold by them are adulterated with sugar syrup, alleging that the study seems to be motivated and aimed at maligning their brands.The two companies also clarified that their products meet all Indian standards.The CSE, in a statement, responded to the claims made by Dabur and Patanjali said, “Any claim of meeting all Indian standards actually holds limited value”.“We stand by our findings. Our findings have revealed that 10 out of 13 brands have failed all tests of purity. Most of these are big brands, including Dabur. This is not only about Dabur. In fact, we have talked about how smaller brands are also adulterated,” the environment watchdog said.The CSE further said Dabur’s claim about compliance with Indian laws comes as “no surprise”.“The fact that samples deliberately adulterated by us by up to 50 per cent of syrups passed all Indian tests is a robust proof of this (sophisticated adulteration). So, any claim of meeting all Indian standards actually holds limited value,” it said.The CSE further said the NMR test report available on Dabur’s website and shared with the media in support of the company’s statement is a report of the Bruker equipment/machine for NMR profiling.On allegations of Patanjali that the move is to promote the German technology, the CSE said NMR test is being used in different parts of the world for the same reason and even the Indian government has mandated it since August 2020 for honey meant to be exported.“So, it could be important to include such advanced testing in government testing system that can help the enforcement agencies to know if the honey sold to consumers is adulterated or not. It can also help the agencies know which companies are selling adulterated honey, which is a crime, and take required punitive action against the defaulters,” the CSE said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/business-of-adulteration-sophisticated-brands-confuse-consumers-with-language-jugglery-cse-179491
03-12-2020||Mumbai||Plea filed to suspend Kangana Ranaut's Twitter account in Bombay HC; here's her reaction||A member of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee on Thursday sent a legal notice to Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut over her tweet allegedly targeting farmers protesting against the new farm laws.The notice was sent by advocate Harpreet Singh Hora on behalf of the committee member Jasmain Singh Noni.The notice said that when Ranaut’s premises (in Mumbai) were demolished, she used social media “to gather solidarity” from her fans, stating that the action was an attack on her fundamental rights.“Similarly, the right to peacefully protest is part of the farmers’ rights under the Constitution of India and she cannot claim a right to demean and insult the farmers,” the notice said.As per the notice, Kangana had shared a tweet alleging that the ‘Shaheen Bagh dadi’, who made international headlines during the anti-CAA protests earlier this year in the Delhi neighbourhood of Shaheen Bagh, also joined the farmers’ agitation over the new agri laws.The notice stated that the actor said in her tweet that the “same Dadi” who featured in Time Magazine was “available in 100 rupees”.The legal notice also said that several news reports claimed that the said two women were not the same. “And even otherwise, she has no right to defame any old woman for her political mileage,” it said.“This is a clear example of a hate tweet and needs to be tackled at the earliest,” the notice said.Thousands of farmers have gathered at Delhi’s gateways to demand a repeal of the Centre’s three new farm laws. The protesting farmers are worried the new laws will eliminate the safety cushion of a Minimum Support Price (MSP) and procurement system, while rendering ineffective the mandi system that ensures earnings for various stakeholders in the farm sector.The government has been in talks with farmer leaders to resolve the issue. Reacting to the tweet, Kangana wrote on the microblogging site saying Twitter is not the only platform where she can voice her opinion."Ha ha ha I am continuously taking about Akhand Bharat, inevitably fighting tukde gang everyday and I am accused of dividing the nation. Wah!!! Kya baat hai, anyway twitter is not the only platform for me in one chutki thousands camera will appear for my single statement," she wrote.Ha ha ha I am continuously taking about Akhand Bharat, inevitably fighting tukde gang everyday and I am accused of dividing the nation 😂Wah!!! Kya baat hai, anyway twitter is not the only platform for me in one chutki thousands camera will appear for my single statement 🙂 https://t.co/0BgAEd7iKO  In a separate tweet, the actress mentioned: "So tukde gang remember you will have to kill me to suppress my voice, and then I will speak through every Indian and that's precisely my dream, whatever you do inevitably you will make me realise my dream and purpose and that's why I respect my villains."So tukde gang remember you will have to kill me to suppress my voice, and then I will speak through every Indian and that’s precisely my dream, whatever you do inevitably you will make me realise my dream and purpose and that’s why I respect my villains ❤️  The development comes on a day when the actress has been engaged in an ugly war of words with actor-singer Diljit Dosanjh on Twitter.

At least Rs 8,000 crore is due under GST. Despite financial constraints, we had met the recommendations of all previous pay commissions (Sixth Pay Commission). We will also provide three per cent hike in DA from January 2021," she said.The Chief Minister said the exercise would incur an expense of Rs 2,200 crore on the state's exchequer."More than Rs 85,000 crore dues are yet to be cleared by the Centre but that will not prevent us from giving our people their dues," she said.Mamata further said that 9.5 lakh students of 14,000 higher secondary schools and 636 madrasas would be given tablets for free for their online classes.The state has also made arrangements to ensure RT-PCR tests are conducted at a rate of Rs 950, she added.

03-12-2020||---||Love jihad: UP ordinance on religious conversion, inter-faith marriages challenged in SC||New Delhi, December 3Days after the Uttar Pradesh Governor promulgated an ordinance to check unlawful religious conversion for inter-faith marriages, a PIL has been filed in the Supreme Court challenging its validity, contending it violated fundamental rights of citizens and went against public policy.“This ordinance can become a potent tool in the hands of bad elements of the society to falsely implicate anyone and there are probabilities of falsely implicating persons who are not involved in any such acts and it will result in grave injustice,” petitioners Vishal Thakre, Abhay Singh Yadav and Pranvesh submitted.They demanded that pending final adjudication of their petition, the operation of the ordinance should be stayed.The Uttar Pradesh Vidhi Virudh Dharma Samparivartan Pratishedh Adhyadhesh, 2020 (Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020) – which was promulgated last month – prescribes imprisonment from one year to 5 years, or Rs 15,000 fine (in normal cases) minimum three years and maximum 10 years, and fine of Rs 25,000, if the girl is a minor or from the SC/ST community. It prescribes a jail term of minimum three years up to 10 years, and Rs 50,000 fine in cases involving mass religious conversion. The offence is cognizable and non-bailable.The petitioners have also challenged the validity of the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018.According to the Ordinance, no person shall convert or attempt to convert either directly or otherwise any other person from one religion to another by use or practice of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage nor shall any person abet, convince or conspire such conversion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/love-jihad-up-ordinance-on-religious-conversion-inter-faith-marriages-challenged-in-sc-179486
03-12-2020||New Delhi||India no threat or gets threatened by anyone: Defence Secretary||Emphasising that India’s defence relations with other countries is based on free, open and inclusive, rules-based order, the government on Thursday said emergence of the country is neither a threat to any country nor does New Delhi get threatened by anyone.“Our defence relationships are based on free, open, inclusive and rules based order, economic growth to meet aspirations of 1.3 billion people of India and about 2 billion people of the region; emergence of India is not a threat to anyone. Nor do we get threatened by anyone,” Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar said delivering the annual YB Chavan Lecture at the Manohar Parrikar Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses on “Defence Policy- Contours and Challenges”.The remarks came both in the backdrop of continuing stand-off with China in Ladakh region and the recent expanded Malabar naval exercise that added Australia back to the trilateral India-US-Japan trilateral annual engagement.The previous exercise in 2007 resulted in China raising a flag of protest and later Australia pulled out of such an engagement. The expanded Malabar also comes in the wake of reinforcing of Quad meeting at the Foreign Minister-level·Visualising a major potential for India to increase its share in the multi-billion dollar defence and aerospace sector and establish the country as player of consequence, the government wants to promote private sector while improving efficiency of public sector undertakings.“The defence and aerospace sector is US $300 billion opportunity of which presently we form a small pie. India needs to increase its share in the sector. For India to be able to make its mark in a global stage of defence production ecosystem, we need to promote our private sector in defence and aerospace while increasing the efficiency and productivity of our public sector,” he said.Information technology and software development, he said is one field where the country has expertise and can leverage.He said many international defence manufacturers source information communication technology from India. There is scope for India to step up engagement in the field of both Artificial Intelligence and Block Chain technology.A country with large scale of defence requirements, he said, cannot afford to continue with being dependent on others for its equipment and remain one of the biggest importers of arms“The answer lies in greater self reliance. Atmanirbhar Bharat is a key foundation of our defence policy. India cannot emerge as a major defence player, unless we create the requisite self-reliance within the defence industry and emerge as a manufacturing hub. Indigenous production of our defence requirements is the ideal situation and has to be the long term vision for India,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-no-threat-or-gets-threatened-by-anyone-defence-secretary-179484

03-12-2020||London||Indian schoolteacher wins USD 1 million Global Teacher Prize for promoting girls’ education||A primary school teacher from India was on Thursday named the winner of the USD 1-million annual Global Teacher Prize 2020 in recognition of his efforts to promote girls’ education and trigger a quick-response (QR) coded textbook revolution in India.Ranjitsinh Disale, 32, from Paritewadi village in Maharashtra’s Solapur district, emerged the winner from 10 finalists from across the world for the annual prize founded by the Varkey Foundation in 2014 to recognise an exceptional teacher who has made an outstanding contribution to the profession.Disale, who believes that teachers are the world’s “real change-makers”, announced that he will be sharing 50 per cent of his prize money with his fellow finalists to support their “incredible work”.“The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed education and the communities it serves in a multitude of ways. But in this hard time, teachers are giving their best to make sure every student has access to their birthright of a good education,” said Disale.“Teachers are the real change-makers who are changing the lives of their students with a mixture of chalk and challenges. They always believe in giving and sharing. And, therefore, I am very pleased to announce that I will share 50 per cent of the prize money equally among my fellow top 10 finalists to support their incredible work. I believe, together, we can change this world because sharing is growing,” he said.His generous gesture means the other nine finalists will receive just over USD 55,000 each as he made history as the first winner to share his prize money.“By sharing the prize money, you teach the world the importance of giving,” said Indian education philanthropist Sunny Varkey, the founder of the prize.“I now encourage you to use this platform to give all teachers a voice. There is not a moment to lose as it will fall on young people to find solutions to problems that their parents and grandparents have lacked the will to solve, including climate change, conflict and global pandemics,” he said.In another first, the Global Teacher Prize 2020 winner’s announcement was made at a virtual ceremony broadcast from the Natural History Museum in London by British actor-broadcaster Stephen Fry.“Teachers like Ranjitsinh will stop climate change and build more peaceful and just societies. Teachers like Ranjitsinh will eliminate inequalities and drive forward economic growth. Teachers like Ranjitsinh will save our future,” said Stefania Giannini, Assistant Director General for Education at UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation), a partner of the initiative.When Disale arrived at the Zilla Parishad Primary School at Paritewadi in Solapur in 2009, it was a dilapidated building, sandwiched between a cattle shed and a storeroom.He took on the task of turning things around and ensuring the textbooks were available in the local language for the pupils and not only translated the class textbooks into his pupils’ mother tongue but also embedded them with unique QR codes to give students access to audio poems, video lectures, stories and assignments.The impact of his interventions has been that there are now no reported teenage marriages in the village and 100 per cent attendance of girls at the school.Disale’s school went on to become the first in the state of Maharashtra to introduce QR codes and after submitting a proposal and successful pilot scheme, the state ministry announced in 2017 that they would introduce QR coded textbooks across the state for all grades.In 2018, the Human Resources Development Ministry announced that all the National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT) textbooks would have embedded QR codes.Disale is equally passionate about building peace between young people across conflict zones and through a “Let’s Cross the Borders” project, he connects young people from India and Pakistan, Palestine and Israel, Iraq and Iran, and the US and North Korea.Over a six-week programme, students are matched with a peace buddy from other countries with whom they closely interact.

In such a situation, the RJD and the opposition coalition were better off not contesting just for the sake of contesting".The RJD had taken exception to the BJP denying the LJP a chance to retain the seat, allegedly out of "khunnas" (spite) towards the party's young president Chirag Paswan who went solo in the recently held assembly polls which harmed the NDA, in particular the JD(U) headed by the chief minister.However, the 37-year-old LJP leader made it clear that Reena Paswan, his mother, had no political ambitions and acknowledged the fact that his father had got elected from a seat that "belonged to the BJP, which must have the right to decide whom to field".Ram Vilas Paswan had got elected last year in a by-poll necessitated by his cabinet colleague Ravi Shankar Prasad's election to the Lok Sabha.LJP sources also said that the party was hopeful of a berth in the Union council of ministers for Chirag as the party was now left with no representation despite being a steadfast NDA ally.They also said throwing the hat in the ring for the Rajya Sabha polls would have meant burning the bridges with the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-rs-bypoll-sushil-modi-set-for-walkover-as-oppn-chooses-not-to-enter-fray-179478

She chose the name as a tribute to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose whose 125th birth anniversary will be celebrated in 2022.Banerjee, who was railway minister on two occasions, said the Railways as a rule try to help people at the time of a crisis and run special trains. But it made an exception in the case of Jai Hind Bridge. Since railway tracks ran below the flyover, the state government had to give Rs 34 crore to them, the Chief Minister said.“I am asking the Railways that who gave them the direction to take the money from us. It should be returned. So many schools and colleges could be built with the money”, Banerjee said.The Chief Minister also accused the Railways of holding back permission resulting into nine months delay in throwing open the bridge to public. “I am not blaming the officers or the engineers of Railways. I am angry with the leaders who are pulling the strings sitting in Delhi”, Mamata said.The Chief Minister also attacked the BJP for holding a demonstration on the bridge on November 26 demanding its early completion.“Those leading the demonstration were begging the police to arrest them even though the police were not interested”, Mamata remarked.The Chief Minister also criticised the Kolkata Port Trust (under the Ministry of Shipping) for forking out Rs 77 lakh from state government for facilitating the work of construction of the new bridge.The new flyover had cost Rs 311.76 crore and the expense was entirely borne by state government, Banerjee said. While the previous bridge could support weight of up to 155 MT, the new bridge was having the capacity of 385 MT, she said.Three more flyovers – one from Ganesh Chandra Avenue to New Market, another from Taratala to Jadavpur Phari and yet another from Park Circus to Ballygunge Phari – were in the pipeline for Kolkata, the CM said.The network of metro rail and flyover would cover the metropolis in such a manner that transportation would become a smooth and easy affair, the Chief Minister said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-banerjee-inaugurates-jai-hind-bridge-blasts-railways-179471

Each side should strictly abide by and respect the LAC and should not take any unilateral action to alter it.The Indian objective is to ensure complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the western sector and full restoration of peace and tranquility, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at a media briefing.Currently, the two sides continue to maintain communication through diplomatic and military channels. Both sides have agreed to have another round of senior commanders meeting at an appropriate time.“As and when we have more information, we will share it with you,” said Srivastava.Asked whether External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s called his Australian counterpart Marise Pyne at a time when Canberra and Beijing were involved in a social media war over the killing of 39 troops by Australian military, Srivastava said: “Given the depth and importance of our bilateral relations, naturally, we exchange views on regional and global developments as well as current issues of concern.”He pointed out that India and Australia enjoy strong bilateral relationship and both were democracies with shared values while noting that the India-Australia bilateral relationship was in June elevated to Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.Srivastava also noted that this year Australia had participated in the recently concluded Malabar joint naval exercises.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-border-talks-stalemated-on-core-issue-mea-179462

03-12-2020||New Delhi||Safeguard rights of lower riparian states: India to China||India continues to remain engaged with China on its plans to build a massive hydel project on a tributary of the river Brahmaputra and has urged Beijing to ensure that the interests of lower riparian states are not harmed.“We have taken note and are carefully monitoring the issue,” said External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava during a media briefing here on Thursday.The MEA spokesperson was referring to China’s plan to build a large hydropower project on the Yarlung Zangbo river that has raised concerns in India over potential political and ecological threats.The two downstream riparian states in this respect are India and Bangladesh.“As a lower riparian state with considerable established user rights to the waters of the trans-border rivers, the Indian Government has consistently conveyed its views and concerns to the Chinese authorities and has urged them to ensure that the interests of downstream states were not harmed by any activities in upstream areas,” he said.The MEA put India’s concerns in perspective by pointing out that it is a lower riparian state with considerable user rights to trans-boundary rivers.China has been urged to ensure that the downstream interests are not harmed. In response, the Chinese side has conveyed that these are run-of-river hydel projects and involve no diversion of river waters.“India intends to remain engaged with China on trans-border rivers to safeguard our interests,” added Srivastava.There is concern in India that China will use the hydroelectric project as a tool to promote a political strategy in the region, with their border conflict as the backdrop, to potentially restrict India’s right to utilise downstream water resources.The Chinese side says that China’s water resource development along the Yarlung Zangbo river was put off for years due to India’s protests. It says the dam on Yarlung Zangbo river can generate the largest amount of power from the section closest to the border.Beijing has also said India should not have “any anxiety” over the project and it will continue to have “good communication” with lower riparian states — India and Bangladesh.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a media briefing on Thursday that “hydropower development in the lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo river is China’s legitimate right”.“When it comes to use and development of cross border rivers, China always acts responsibly,” she said.“We have a policy featuring development and conservation and all projects will go through science-based planning and assessment giving full consideration to impact downstream and accommodating the interests of upstream and downstream regions,” she added.India and China had established the Expert Level Mechanism (ELM) in 2006 to discuss various issues related to trans-border rivers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/safeguard-rights-of-lower-riparian-states-india-to-china-179452

All states except Jharkhand and all the three union territories with Legislative Assembly have decided in favour of option-1,” read a Finance Ministry statement.The states and union territories that choose option-1 are getting the amount of shortfall arising out of GST implementation through a special borrowing window put in place by the Government of India.The Centre has already borrowed Rs 30,000 crore on behalf of the states in five installments and has passed it on to 26 states and three union territories on October 23, November 2, November 9, November 23 and December 1. From the next round of borrowings, Chattisgarh too would receive funds raised through this window.Under the terms of option-1, besides getting the facility of a special window for borrowings to meet the shortfall arising out of GST implementation, states are also entitled to get an unconditional permission to borrow the final installment of 0.50 per cent of gross state domestic product (GSDP) out of the 2 per cent additional borrowings permitted by the Government of India, under Aatmanirbhar Abhiyaan. This is over and above the special window of Rs 1.1 lakh crore.On receipt of the choice of option-1 from the Government of Chattisgarh, the Government of India has granted additional borrowing permission of Rs 1,792 crore to the Government of Chattisgarh (0.5 per cent of Chattisgarh's GSDP), the ministry added.Separately, Chattisgarh will get Rs 3,109 crore through special borrowing window to meet the GST implementation shortfall.States who have opted for option-1 are – Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tripura, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal, along with the three union territories of Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir and Puducherry.Under the borrowing plan (option-1), the Centre would borrow from market Rs 1.10 lakh crore which is the revenue shortfall on account of GST implementation. The remaining Rs 73,000-crore shortfall is estimated to be the revenue impact of COVID-19 pandemic.The second option given by the Centre was for the states to borrow the entire Rs 1.83 lakh crore collection shortfall.

03-12-2020||New Delhi||Emergency drug regulator approval for Covid vaccine by Dec-end: AIIMS Director||AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria on Thursday pinned his hopes on the five COVID-19 vaccine candidates which are in advanced stages of clinical trial in India, stating they are logistically feasible for distribution in both urban and rural areas.His assertion comes amid Pfizer-BioNTech's anti-coronavirus vaccine getting emergency clearance in the UK, paving the way for mass vaccinations against the deadly novel coronavirus from as early as next week.Dr Guleria expressed hope that by the end of this month or early next month, at least one of the five vaccines being locally-tested should get emergency use authorisation from the drug regulator to be administered to the public starting with priority groups.According to sources, global pharma giant Pfizer had talks with the Indian government late August, but since then there has been no development.During a briefing last month, NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr V K Paul, who also heads the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration, said that sufficient doses of the Pfizer vaccine as required for the Indian population will not be available but the government is examining the possibilities and will work out a strategy (for its procurement and distribution) in case the vaccine gets regulatory approvals. The requirement of an extreme low temperature of -70 deg C for storing the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer poses a big challenge for its delivery in a developing nation like India, especially in its smaller towns and rural areas where maintaining such cold chain facilities would be very difficult, Guleria said."Five vaccine candidates are in advanced stages of clinical trial in India and no significant serious adverse effects have been seen so far. Also, they are logistically feasible for distribution in a large country like India, both in its urban and rural parts.  "Hopefully, by the end of this month or early next month, at least one of them should get emergency authorisation from the Indian drug regulator for its distribution among Indian population," he said.The five vaccines are under different phases of clinical trials in India with the Serum Institute of India conducting phase-3 trial of the Oxford-Astrazeneca COVID-19 vaccine, while the indigenously developed vaccine by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR has already started the phase-3 clinical trial. Another indigenously-developed vaccine by Zydus Cadila has also completed phase -2 clinical trial in the country.  Dr Reddy's Laboratories and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) on Tuesday announced the start of adaptive phase 2 and 3 clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V in India.Also, Biological E. Ltd has started early phase 1 and 2 human trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/emergency-drug-regulator-approval-for-covid-vaccine-by-dec-end-aiims-director-179449

03-12-2020||---||Stamp on Gujral's 101st birth anniversary||New Delhi, December 3Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu will on Friday virtually release a commemorative postage stamp on former Prime Minister IK Gujral on his 101st birth anniversary.Born on December 4, Gujral passed away on November 30, 2012, after having retired from politics 14 years earlier.A former Union Minister and ambassador, he was best known for the ‘Gujral doctrine’ which is being pursued by the current dispensation as the ‘Neighbourhood First Policy’.A set of five principles to conduct foreign policy with the smaller neighbours, the doctrine arose from the conviction that India’s stature and strength cannot be isolated from the quality of its relations with its neighbours.This meant not seeking from neighbours but accommodating them, as far as possible, in good faith and trust. It also sought abstinence by all South Asian countries from permitting their land to be used against the interest of another country of the region and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of another neighbour.The ‘Gujral doctrine’ had triggered a turnaround in ties with at least four neighbours – Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka – though the trend did not sustain.India resolved the water-sharing dispute with Bangladesh in three months, it inked the Mahakali River treaty with Nepal for hydel power generation, led to expanding of development cooperation with Sri Lanka and, most important, began the process of composite dialogue with Pakistan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stamp-on-gujrals-101st-birth-anniversary-179446

This includes six professional managers and 25 entrepreneurs.Shaw leads in the self-made category, followed by Radha Vembu of Zoho (Rs 11,590 crore networth) and Jayshree Ullal of Arista Networks (Rs 10,220 crore), it said.Interestingly, all the three—Shaw, Ullal and Vembu—also feature in a global rich list prepared by Hurun.The average age of women on the list, whose cumulative wealth is pegged at Rs 2.72 lakh crore, is 53 and 19 of the 100 women are under the age of 40, it said.Two of the women have promoted unicorns—retailer Nykaa's Falguni Nayar who has a wealth of Rs 5,410 crore and 34-year-old Divya Gokulanth of Byju's with a networth of Rs 3,490 crore.Some families contributed more than one person to the women's rich list. Apollo Hospitals Enterprise leads with four entrants, followed by three from the Godrej Group.From a sectoral perspective, pharmaceuticals leads with 13 entrants, followed closely by 12 from textiles and apparels and 9 from healthcare.Financial capital Mumbai contributed 32 individuals to the list, while 20 are New Delhi and 10 from Hyderabad, it said.Only four of the 100 women find a place in the list of the highest givers who champion social causes, it said.Anu Aga and Meher Pudumjee of Thermax are the most generous women, followed by Shaw, Renu Munjal of Hero Fincorp and Leena Gandhi Tewari of USV. — PTI “Digitization is the buzzword, whether it’s in a family business or not.” — Roshni Nadar Malhotra, Chairperson, HCL Technologies. #ForbesAsiaCEO pic.twitter.com/IeLWartFa0||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hcls-roshni-nadar-richest-woman-in-india-a-third-of-entrants-in-list-self-made-179444
03-12-2020||Beijing||Will have good communication with India, China on its plan to build big dam over Brahmaputra river||China on Thursday played down its plan to build a major dam in the lower reaches of the Brahmaputra river in Tibet, saying there is no need to have “any anxiety” over the project and Beijing will continue to have "good communication" with lower riparian states – India and Bangladesh.China's plan to build the dam over Brahmaputra river, reportedly at Medog in Tibet, which borders Arunachal Pradesh, was disclosed by Yan Zhiyong, chairman of the Power Construction Corp of China, at a conference recently.The over 3,800-km-long Brahmaputra, one of the longest rivers in the world passes through China, India and Bangladesh and has several tributaries and sub-tributaries. Yan said China will "implement hydropower exploitation in the downstream of the Yarlung Zangbo River (the Tibetan name for Brahmaputra) and the project could serve to maintain water resources and domestic security,” the Global Times reported on Sunday.Asked about China's plans to build the dam over the river near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) near Arunachal Pradesh where the Brahmaputra enters India, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing on Thursday that the "hydropower development in the lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo river is China's legitimate right”.“When it comes to use and development of cross border rivers, China always acts responsibly," said Hua."We have a policy featuring development and conservation and all projects will go through science-based planning and assessment giving full consideration to impact downstream and accommodating the interests of upstream and downstream regions," Hua added. "The development of lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo is in the early stages of planning and assessment. There is no need to read too much into that," she said.As a lower riparian state with considerable established user rights to the waters of the trans-border rivers, the Indian Government has consistently conveyed its views and concerns to the Chinese authorities and has urged them to ensure that the interests of downstream states were not harmed by any activities in upstream areas."For a long time, China, India and Bangladesh have had good cooperation in sharing hydrological information, flood and disaster reduction and contingency management. We will continue communication through existing channels," said the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson.Asked whether China would discuss the future course of action with India and Bangladesh, she said, "Actually, for a long time the three countries – China, India and Bangladesh – have been in close communication on sharing hydrological information, flood prevention and disaster reduction and contingency management.""Going forward China, India, Bangladesh and other concerned countries will continue to have good communication. There is no need for any anxiety on this matter," she said.India and China established Expert Level Mechanism (ELM) in 2006 to discuss various issues related to trans-border rivers.Under existing bilateral Memorandums of Understanding, China provides hydrological information of Brahmaputra and Sutlej to India during the flood seasons.Under the arrangement, China provides flood season data of the Brahmaputra river between May 15 and October 15 every year.The report raised concerns in India as China has already operationalised the USD 1.5 billion Zam Hydropower Station, the largest in Tibet in 2015.The dams in Tibet are a cause of concern for India as besides controlling the flow of the water, they could release large volumes of water in times of war. Yan said the project was clearly put forward in the proposals for formulating the country's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) and its long-term goals through 2035 made by the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).The 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) was adopted by Plenum – a key policy body of the CPC in October this year. Details of the plan were expected to be released after the formal ratification by National People's Congress (NPC) early next year."There is no parallel in history. It will be a historic opportunity for the Chinese hydropower industry," Yan told the conference organised to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the China Society for Hydropower.He said that the hydropower exploitation of the Yarlung Zangbo River downstream was more than a hydropower project. It is also meaningful for the environment, national security, living standards, energy and international cooperation, he said.According to the Global Times report, the mainstream of the Yarlung Zangbo river has the richest water resources in Tibet Autonomous Region, about 80 million kilowatt hours (kWh), while the 50-km section of the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon has 70 million kWh that could be developed with a 2,000-metre drop, which equals more than three Gorges power stations in Hubei province.Tibet has about 200 million kWh of water resources, accounting for 30 per cent of the total in China.

On NH-1, both sides of the route have been closed near Shani Mandir,” the Delhi Traffic Police tweeted.The crowd of farmers continued to swell at Ghazipur, prompting the police to close the Delhi-UP border on NH-24.“The Ghazipur border on NH-24 is closed for traffic from Ghaziabad towards Delhi due to farmers’ protests. People are advised to avoid NH-24 for coming to Delhi and use Apsara/Bhopra/DND instead,” the traffic police said.It said NH-44 is closed on both sides and asked people to take alternate routes via NH-8, Bhopra, Apsara border, and Peripheral expressway At the Chilla border, one carriageway — from Delhi to Noida — has been opened for traffic. However, the other carriageway — from Noida to Delhi — is still closed.People commuting from Noida to Delhi are advised to avoid Noida link road, the traffic police said.The Delhi-Haryana border at Jharoda and Jhatikra remained closed for traffic movement. The Badusarai border is open only for two-wheeler traffic.However, people can travel to Haryana through Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri, NH-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera border points, the traffic police have said.The police also kept the Haryana-Delhi border at Singhu and Tikri closed for traffic for the eighth day on the trot.“Singhu border is still closed from both sides. Lampur, Auchandi & other small borders also closed. Please take alternate routes. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba Chowk & GTK Road,” the traffic police tweeted.“Traffic is very heavy. Please avoid Outer Ring Road from Signature Bridge to Rohini & vice versa, GTK road, NH 44 & Singhu, Auchandi & Lampur borders,” it said.As traffic spilled over to alternate routes, it led to long jams there as well.On Wednesday, the farmers had demanded that a special Parliament session be convened to repeal the three agriculture reform laws which were enacted in September.The farmers’ unions also called for a nationwide protest on Saturday to oppose what they claimed was “corporatisation” of farming.

Only a coward who can't take care of his wife and children commits suicide. When we have fallen (in the water), we have to swim and win," Patil said addressing farmers at Ponnampet in Kodagu district of Karnataka.The Minister was explaining to bamboo growers of Ponnampet how profitable the agriculture business is, but some cowards do not realise that and commit suicide.To buttress his point, Patil cited an example of a woman who was wearing gold bangles."When I enquired with her how her hands were full of gold bangles, You know what she said? She said, "This mother earth has given me for my 35 years of toil.""Doesn't this please you all after listening to this?" Patil told the gathering.He said when a woman who had depended herself entirely on agriculture and achieved big why other farmers cannot do it.Reacting to this, Congress Karnataka unit spokesperson V S Ugrappa condemned the Minister's statement, saying he has shown disrespect to the farming community."It's a disrespect to the farmers. He should apologise for it," Ugrappa told PTI.He said the Minister should have gone into the subject to find why some farmers commit suicide."No farmer wishes to end life. There are many reasons such as floods and droughts, which have not been understood and solved yet. Instead of understanding the gravity of the problem, the Minister gives such an irresponsible statement," Ugrappa said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-who-commit-suicide-are-cowards-says-karnataka-minister-179436
03-12-2020||New Delhi||‘MDH Dadaji’ Gulati, who drove tonga for livelihood before embarking on Rs 1,500-cr empire journey||School-dropout Mahashay Dharampal Gulati, famously known as ‘MDH Dadaji’ for repeated appearances in his spice brand’s television ads, started his spices business journey as a nondescript shack in Delhi’s Karol Bagh after selling his tonga, and went on, at the age of 94, to becoming the highest-paid CEO in the country’s FMCG sector.Gulati, also known as the Spice King, was born in Sialkot (now in Pakistan) on March 27, 1923, and moved to India after Partition and set up his business in Delhi.His father had a spice shop in Sialkot, called ‘Mahashian Di Hatti’ (MDH), but the outlet was popularly known as ‘Deggi Mirch Wale’.His family left behind everything during Partition to come and settle in Delhi.Gulati, who dropped out of school in 1933 after class 5, dabbled in many odd jobs including learning woodwork, working in a soap factory, fabric factory and a rice factory.After Partition, he arrived in Delhi in September 1947 with Rs 1,500, mentions a bio-sketch of him on MDH’s portal.He used the money to buy a tonga (horse cart) for Rs 650 and drove it from New Delhi Railway Station to Qutab Road and Karol Bagh to Bara Hindu Rao for few days.He sold his carriage in October 1948 to restart his ancestral business by opening a small shop at Ajmal Khan Road, Karol Bagh. He never looked back.As the business grew, he himself appeared on television commercials endorsing Deggi Mirch, Chat Masala, and Chana Masala, among the most famous products from the MDH stable, which has over 50 products.Over the years, the MDH Dadaji, or Mahashay as he was popularly known, became a household name.The King of Spices is now no more—he passed away in Delhi on December 3, aged 97.His father Mahashay Chunni Lal Gulati founded MDH Spices in 1919, and Dharampal would later turn it into a Rs 1,500-crore empire.The company was officially established in 1959 when Gulati bought land in Kirti Nagar and set up a manufacturing unit.Starting with manually ground spices, MDH soon switched over to automatic machines to meet the fast-growing demand for spices. Today, spices worth crores of rupees are manufactured and packed by modern machines and sold throughout India and abroad by the company through a network of over 1,000 stockists and over 4 lakh retail dealers.These machines have the capacity to produce 30 tonnes of spices in powders packed in different sizes (10g to 500g) in a day.Today, MDH spices are exported to various parts of the world, including the UK, Europe, UAE and Canada.Gulati, who took home Rs 21 crore salary in 2017, was said to donate nearly 90 per cent of it to charity through his Mahashay Chunni Lal Charitable Trust. The Trust operates a 250-bed hospital in Delhi, along with a mobile hospital for slum-dwellers as well as four schools.Gulati established more than 20 schools.He was associated with several educational institutions including MDH International School, Mahashay Chunnilal Saraswati Shishu Mandir, Mata Leela Wati Kanya Vidhayala, and Mahashay Dharmpal Vidhya Mandir, according to his bio-sketch.For his contributions, Gulati was awarded the Padma Bhushan, the country’s third-highest civilian award, in 2019.Tributes for the entrepreneur, whose face became synonymous with his brand, has poured in on social media platforms.President Ram Nath Kovind and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal paid their tributes to the popular personality on Twitter. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mdh-dadaji-gulati-who-drove-tonga-for-livelihood-before-embarking-on-rs-1-500-cr-empire-journey-179435
03-12-2020||New Delhi||HC grants custody parole to jailed former Bihar MP Shahabuddin to meet kin in Delhi||The Delhi High Court has granted custody parole for three days to jailed former MP Mohd Shahabuddin, who is lodged in Tihar Jail and serving life term in a murder case, to meet his family in the national capital, noting that the police departments of Bihar and Delhi are in unison that they cannot assure his safety in Siwan.The former Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) parliamentarian, a convict and an undertrial, was shifted to Tihar Jail in 2018 by the Supreme Court from Siwan jail in Bihar.He had prayed for granting custody parole to visit Siwan to meet his family on account of his father’s death.Justice A J Bhambhani, who said this is not an ordinary case, noted the police departments of both Bihar and Delhi are saying in unison that they cannot assure Shahabuddin’s custody and safety and alternatively, they are saying that they would need to deploy inordinately vast resources, if his custody and safety is to be ensured.“Rare is it to come-upon a case where state governments are unsure and dithering to make a commitment that they can ensure the custody of a prisoner. This however, is definitely such a case,” the high court said.It also referred to the Supreme Court’s previous orders which had recorded that the State of Bihar had said in a counter affidavit that Shahabuddin controls a ‘private army’, and that he has been accused of being involved in murder cases even while he was in judicial custody.Shahabuddin has sought custody parole to go to Siwan on the ground that his father passed away on September 19 and he wishes to spend time with his grieving mother, who is unwell, and family members and to offer prayers at the grave of his late father.The high court granted “custody parole” to Shahabuddin for a period of six hours at a time on any three days of his choice, whether consecutive or otherwise, within 30 days from the date of the order, which was passed on Wednesday.“On each of these three days, the petitioner (Shahabuddin) would be taken ‘in custody’ with adequate police security and protection, to a single address of his choice to be indicated by him in writing to the Jail Superintendent in advance, but only within the State of Delhi; which address and location would be verified and secured appropriately by the State,” it said.It said during the custody parole, he shall be free to meet only his mother, wife and any other blood relatives and afforded sufficient privacy to interact with such persons.The high court made it clear that Shahabuddin shall not be entitled to the presence of his personal guards.The court said it has given its painful consideration to the prayers made in the petition and is of the opinion that a very strict balancing is required between the humane considerations for grant of custody parole and the overarching considerations of ensuring judicial custody of the prisoner, his own safety and the safety of others and ensuring that there is no subversion of the legal process.“After all, the Supreme Court has in exercise of its extraordinary judicial powers, transferred the petitioner to Delhi to undergo sentence as well as trials outside the State of Bihar for compelling considerations. It is evident that the very presence of the petitioner within the State of Bihar was perceived by the Supreme Court as a grave threat and interference in the course of justice.“Yet, in an effort to balance competing interests and rights, as propounded by the Supreme Court, this court would not completely negate the petitioner’s plea for custody parole in the backdrop of the recent bereavement he has suffered,” it said.Earlier, Delhi government counsel had said the state cannot be held responsible for safety and security of the prisoner in Bihar.He had said it will be difficult to take him to Bihar as a full police battalion is required to go with him and also due to COVID-19 pandemic.The Bihar government’s affidavit said if the custody, safety and security of Shahabuddin is to be ensured within Bihar, it would require huge police force, besides the security personnel who would ensure his safety during transportation within Delhi.Shahabuddin was declared a history-sheeter Type A, or one who is beyond reform and has been a member of the legislative assembly on two occasions and a member of Parliament four times.The apex court on February 15, 2018 had ordered shifting of Shahabuddin, now facing trial in over three dozen criminal cases, from Siwan Jail to Tihar.The top court’s order had come on a plea filed by Asha Ranjan, the widow of slain Siwan-based journalist Rajdeo Ranjan, and Chandrakeshwar Prasad, whose three sons were killed in separate incidents by the gangster.It had on October 30, last year upheld the conviction and sentence of Shahabuddin and three others in a 2004 double murder case in which two brothers were killed for not paying extortion money.Satish and Girish Roshan were murdered in August 2004 in Siwan for refusing to pay extortion money.A third brother, Rajiv Roshan, who was an eyewitness to the incident in which Shahabuddin’s men allegedly threw acid to kill the two brothers, was shot dead on June 6, 2014.Roshan was killed when he was going to depose against Shahabuddin in the trial court despite threats from the don and his henchmen.On December 9, 2015, a special judge at Siwan had convicted Shahabuddin and his associates for the murders and sentenced them to life imprisonment.On August 30, 2018, the Patna High Court had upheld their conviction and sentence. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-grants-custody-parole-to-jailed-former-bihar-mp-shahabuddin-to-meet-kin-in-delhi-179430

During the lunch break, farmers decided to partake langar brought from a gurdwara.In the last meeting also they had refused to have tea and instead asked Union ministers to have kheer, jalebi and langar with them at the border.Normally during official meetings at Vigyan Bhawan, tea, snacks, lunch, etc., are served to participants.  Meanwhile, it remains to be seen if the meeting will bear any positive results as farmers remain firm on their stated stance.Farmers are demanding guaranteed MSP on all the 23 crops, not just paddy and rice, and this be implemented across the country. They also remain adamant on withdrawal of three Central Acts.Farmers said they did not want any amendment but complete withdrawal. They also said they would not leave Delhi till this was done.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-refuse-to-have-sarkari-khana-want-surety-on-msp-withdrawal-of-agri-acts-179429
03-12-2020||New Delhi||India-Bangladesh border talks to be held outside Delhi for first time||India and Bangladesh are expected to hold their Director General-level border talks in Guwahati later this month, the first time the biannual meeting will be held outside Delhi, official sources said.The 51st edition of these high-level talks will be held between the Border Security Force (BSF) and its counterpart Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) beginning December 22. Discussions on curbing a variety of border crimes and enhancing cooperation between the two countries are expected to be held for four days.Assam’s capital is the base for BSF’s Guwahati frontier headquarters whose troops guard 495 km of the 4,096 km-long India-Bangladesh border that runs along the state and some parts of West Bengal.A special BSF water wing that keeps vigil along the riverine border areas including Dhubri in Assam is under the command of this frontier of the border force.This is the first time since these biannual talks began in 1993 that they are being held outside Delhi, the sources said.The meeting being held near the border may also give an opportunity for the brass of the two sides to jointly visit some border areas in Assam, they said, stating the reason behind moving the talks outside Delhi.The Director General-level talks were held annually between 1975 and 1992 but they were made biannual in 1993 with either side alternatively travelling to the national capitals of New Delhi and Dhaka.A delegation led by BSF Director General Rakesh Asthana had visited Dhaka for these talks in September.Asthana will lead the talks again with his BGB counterpart Maj Gen Shafeenul Islam, the sources said.The current relations between the two countries and the forces are very good and both sides will take them forward during these talks, officials said.While the Indian side is expected to take up the issue of joint border security management, fencing of unfenced areas and undertaking effective steps to curb cross-border crimes, the Bangladeshi border force is expected to take up issues related to the killing of its people along the front.During the last meeting, Asthana had said the killing of criminals along the front will be “made to reduce significantly” even as he reiterated that his troops only fire when their lives are endangered by cross-border miscreants.He had said death or apprehension of criminals on the border was “irrespective of nationalities”.“BSF personnel fire with non-lethal weapon only in self-defence when they are surrounded by a large number of miscreants armed with dah (cleaver-shaped knife), sticks, etc., and their lives are endangered,” he was quoted as saying by a BSF spokesperson.The two sides are also expected to firm up new standard operating procedures (SOPs) in view of the crossing over of a “significant” number of mentally challenged Indian nationals to Bangladesh, a plan mooted by the BSF chief.The two forces, after the Dhaka talks in September, had also decided to “share real-time information” with each other expeditiously through formal or informal channels regarding smuggling of narcotics and human trafficking.It was also decided to share information regarding fake Indian currency notes, cattle, arms, ammunition, explosives, anti-social elements, activities of Indian Insurgent Groups and breach or damage of the border fence. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-bangladesh-border-talks-to-be-held-outside-delhi-for-first-time-179426
03-12-2020||Mumbai||Malegaon blast case: MP Pragya Thakur fails to appear in court||A special NIA court here on Thursday said the trial in 2008 Malegaon blast case will resume from Friday and directed all the seven accused to remain present in the court on December 19.Special NIA court judge P R Sitre had earlier directed all the accused in the case, including BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur and Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Purohit, to remain present in the court on Thursday.However, Pragya Thakur, Ramesh Upadhayay, Sudhakar Diwedi and Sudhakar Chaturvedi did not appear in the court.Thakur had appeared before the court in June last year after it ordered the seven accused to remain present once a week. She later sought exemption from appearance on various occasions since then.Lt Col Purohit, Sameer Kulkarni and Ajay Rahikar were present before the judge on Thursday.The lawyers of the other four accused told the court that their clients were absent due to the COVID-19 situation.The court then directed all the accused to be present before it on December 19.It said the trial in the case, which is being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA), will resume from Friday.Six people were killed and over 100 others injured when an explosive device strapped on a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Malegaon, a town about 200 km from Mumbai in north Maharashtra, on September 29, 2008.The court had framed terror charges against Purohit, Thakur and five other accused in October 2018.The trial in the case could not proceed since March this year as normal functioning of the courts was hampered due to the COVID-19 situation.Responding to a plea seeking day-to-day trial in the case, the probe agency had earlier told the court that it was making all efforts to expedite the case.The trial in the case was also delayed due to retirement of the previous judge V S Padalkar, it had said.As per the NIA, around 140 witnesses out of 400 have been already been examined in the case.Meanwhile, the Bombay High Court on Thursday clarified that it has not stayed the trial in the Malegaon blast case, and said the trial must go on.A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik was hearing a plea filed by Lt Col Prasad Purohit, seeking that charges against him be quashed.Purohit's lawyer sought adjournment on the ground that senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi was not available on Thursday.The court then adjourned the matter till December 14.The bench sought to know at what stage is the trial before the special NIA court.NIA's advocate Sandesh Patil told the HC that the trial will commence on a day-to-day basis from Thursday and the accused persons and some witnesses have been summoned."We have never said that the trial is stayed. The trial must continue," Justice Shinde said.The court noted that there are 400 prosecution witnesses, of whom only 140 have been examined so far.Purohit, in his plea filed in September this year, sought that charges against him be quashed, since the NIA had failed to get a prior sanction under Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) Section 197.Section 197 of the CrPC lays down the procedure for prosecution of public servants and mandates that a prior sanction be sought from the government.Purohit said in the absence of prior sanction, the trial court couldn't have taken cognisance of the charges.As per the plea, Purohit was working for the Indian Army's military intelligence unit and had attended the alleged conspiracy meetings before the blast as part of "discharging his duties".The NIA had opposed the plea, saying Purohit attended the meetings in his personal capacity and not as part of discharging his duties.Purohit, who was arrested in 2009, was reinstated in the Army in 2017 after he was granted bail by the Supreme Court.The accused in the case have been charged under Sections 16 (committing terrorist act) and 18 (conspiring to commit terrorist act) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).They have also been charged under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy), 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 153 (a) (promoting enmity between two religious groups), and relevant provisions of the Explosive Substances Act. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/malegaon-blast-case-mp-pragya-thakur-fails-to-appear-in-court-179423

This will also lead to mutual cooperation between the institutes and the NHAI for the dissemination of respective expertise on the field of civil/highway engineering on National Highway Projects,” officials said.Under this initiative, the partner institutes will study improvement prospects in safety, maintenance, riding comfort, removal of congestion points and usages of new technologies on the adopted stretches and give suitable suggestions to the NHAI for consideration.The institutes will also associate with the NHAI during conceptualisation, design and project preparation of new projects and suggest the relevant parameters and innovations based on experience specific to the site climate, topography and resource potential for better socio-economic outcome.“This initiative will also instil a sense of contribution to building local infrastructure among the students’ fraternity. The NHAI will offer an internship to 20 UG and 20 PG students of the institutes per year. Duration of internship shall be 2 months per student in a year. The internship will be Rs 8,000 for undergraduate students and Rs 15,000 per month for postgraduate students. The NHAI will support the creation of lab infrastructure in the institute and may sponsor a relevant research project that helps in using alternative resource material and improving quality of roads,” the Ministry added.“The NHAI has received an overwhelming response for the initiative from many reputed institutes in a short period of time. So far, 18 IITs, 26 NITs and 190 other reputed engineering colleges have opted for the scheme. Appropriate MOUs are being signed between technical institutes and the NHAI for the adopted stretches, and so far, about 200 institutes have already signed the MOU for implementation of the scheme. It is expected that more than 300 institutes offering civil engineering UG and PG courses will adopt the national highway stretches all over the country,” the Ministry said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iits-nits-reputed-technical-institutes-to-adopt-stretches-of-national-highway-179421

03-12-2020||New Delhi||Indo Gangetic plain global hotspot of atmospheric ammonia: IIT Kharagpur study||The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) is the global hot-spot of atmospheric ammonia (NH3) due to intense agricultural activities and fertilizer production there, according to researchers at The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur.The study titled "Record high levels of atmospheric ammonia over India: Spatial and temporal analyses" has also been published in the international Elsevier journal "Science of the Total Environment". The study by the IIT team was conducted along with researchers from Indian Institute Of Tropical Meteorology, Pune and few European researchers.The team has also recommended a wider adoption of precision farming along with seasonal restrictions on the use of fertilizers. "Agro fertilizers containing high levels of ammonia have long been designated as a hazardous material for human health. In a first-of-its-kind study, the seasonal and inter-annual variability of atmospheric ammonia emitted by the agricultural sector was analysed by us and the results agree with the long-held apprehension of global environmentalists - the Indo-Gangetic Plain is indeed the global hot-spot of atmospheric ammonia," said Jayanarayanan Kuttippurath, Professor at IIT Kharagpur's Centre for Oceans, Rivers, Atmosphere. "The satellite data we collected for agricultural emissions show a positive correlation of atmospheric ammonia with total fertilizer consumption and temperature since high temperature favours volatilization and is negatively correlated with total precipitation as wet deposition helps removal of atmospheric ammonia," he added.Using IASI satellite measurements to analyze the seasonal and inter-annual variability of atmospheric NH3 over India for the period 2008–2016, the researchers observed atmospheric ammonia growing rapidly at a rate of 0.08 pc annually during the summer-monsoon (Kharif crop period) season from June to August."Atmospheric ammonia is typically generated due to agricultural activities including the use of nitrogenous fertilizers, manure management, soil and water management practices and animal husbandry. It is very dynamic as it is constantly exchanged between the atmosphere and biosphere. "In India, there has been a lack of detailed information about atmospheric ammonia, which is a significant contributor to atmospheric pollution and deterioration of air quality. This is particularly important for IGP as there are many cities including New Delhi," Kuttippurath said.The study also mentions that there are positive trends in atmospheric NH3 over the agricultural areas of the United States, China and Europe, about 1.8–2.61 per cent annually, depending on regions. However, the general trend in atmospheric ammonia over India is negative in most seasons. "Observing the overall trend, we can therefore assert to have sincere to our pledge at the Paris Climate Summit towards reducing atmospheric emissions through initiatives under the National Clean Air Programme though we have to be relentless in our efforts to reduce the emissions at the Indo Gangetic Plain, which would otherwise have detrimental effects on the human health, ecosystems and climate," said Kuttippurath.Deliberating on possible remedies, co-authors Ajay Singh and Nirupama Mallick from the IIT Kharagpur's Department of Agricultural and Food Engineering emphasised wider adoption of precision farming along with seasonal restrictions on the use of fertilisers. "Agriculture, in its conventional form, contributes significantly to the atmospheric emission of gaseous ammonia that plays a key role in the deterioration of air quality over the whole of India by actively contributing to the formation of secondary aerosols. This demands regulations on the amount of fertilizer application in cropping seasons in arable lands, in place of conventional blanket recommendation practices, along with viable strategies to curb farm emissions," said Mallick.

But then, if at all it has to be obtained, we are examining what we need to do...and will work out a strategy,” he had said.Currently in India, Pune-based Serum Institute of India has said it would apply for emergency use licensure for AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine in two weeks.Phase-3 clinical trial of the indigenously-developed vaccine candidate of Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is also under way.While vaccine candidate of Zydus Cadila has completed the phase-2 clinical trial, pharma major Dr Reddy’s Laboratories has started the combined phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Russian COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, in India.Another domestic firm Biological E Limited has also started early phase 1 and 2 human trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.

A wonder and miracle will definitely happen,” he tweeted in Tamil.“I am ready to sacrifice even my life for the sake of Tamil people. It is now or never.

Yet, we are witnessing incredible advances made in science, technology, innovation, and manufacturing that will soon deliver a vaccine to billions of people in record time. The IP protections we provide have created the foundation of the industries needed to develop solutions to all of our global challenges, including, and especially, the pandemic. All of which highlights the importance of our MoU,” Iancu said.Iancu, who also serves as Director of USPTO, said the new MoU envisions work on two paths — substantive, and administrative.“Within the substantive pathway, we will jointly build capacity in the full range of intellectual property disciplines, including patents, trademarks, copyright, and geographical indications. On the administrative side, we’ll exchange ideas and share experiences on how to manage the operations of our national IP offices, including the use of tools that can enhance our efficiency and productivity,” Iancu said.Iancu said India and the US were the world’s largest and oldest democracies and had an enduring alliance, and deepening commercial and cultural ties.Last year, total trade between the two countries was $146 billion.“Innovation backed by our intellectual property systems in both countries has played a critically important part in this remarkable growth. Indeed, our countries’ respective patent systems date back a very long time. American and Indian inventors and entrepreneurs, often working together in both of our countries, have made huge advances in science and technology, and have improved the human condition all around,” he said.

It is impacting national security and Punjab’s economy,” he said.The problem needed to be solved quickly, the Chief Minister stressed during a crucial meeting here with Union Home Minister Amit Shah, whom he urged to ensure that the Government of India addressed the concerns of farmers.Singh had a frank meeting with Shah and said he had urged the Centre to find a solution to the ongoing agitation.“The two sides should not take rigid positions and a meeting ground must be found,” said the Chief Minister.Amit Shah and Amarinder Singh met at the former’s residence.The Chief Minister told mediapersons during a brief interaction after his meeting with Shah that while he and his government were not involved in the mediation in any way, and the matter had to be resolved between the Centre and the farmers, an early resolution was vital in the interest of both Punjab and the country, the press release further read.Stressing the need to protect the MSP and continue with the APMC-based mandi system, the Chief Minister urged Shah to listen to farmers with an open mind to resolve the standoff quickly so that farmers from Punjab and other states could return to their homes.“A solution has to be found at the earliest,” he said, adding: “He had come to meet the Union Home Minister to reiterate Punjab’s stand on the imbroglio between farmers and the Central Government, as well as the need to secure the future of the farming community and agriculture.”The Chief Minister had earlier warned that Pakistan and China were fishing in troubled waters over the ongoing farmers’ agitation over agriculture reform bills. He had earlier said that Pakistan had been sending drones into India.A day before, Ludhiana MP Ravneet Bittu said on record that certain Khalistani elements had penetrated the protests and Amit Shah should take control as the agitation had gone out of hand.Asked what his position on farm laws is, Amarinder said: “That is between the Centre and the farmers. I only came here to tell the Home Minister to find a quick solution in the interest of India’s security and Punjab’s economic well-being.”The Chief Minister did not take a position on what the Centre should do about farm laws despite Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeting before Capt’s meeting with Shah that anything less than the repeal of black laws would be a betrayal of farmers interests.In an important cue to the Chief Minister ahead of the meeting, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said: “Anything less than the repeal of black farm laws would be a betrayal of the farmers of India.”Capt Amarinder may also be part of the deliberations the Centre has with farmers.The Chief Minister had earlier warned the Centre of the agitation and sought a status quo with respect to Punjab, where he said the ‘arhtiya’ system was part of the social fabric of the agriculture dominated landscape.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amarinder-appeals-to-farmers-to-resolve-crisis-saying-agitation-is-affecting-punjab-economy-179392
03-12-2020||Bareilly (UP)||UP Police make first arrest under new anti-conversion law||The Uttar Pradesh Police has made its first arrest under the new anti-conversion law, days after a man complained that someone is harassing his daughter in a bid to change her religion, officials said on Thursday.Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel on November 28 had given assent to the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, against forcible or fraudulent religious conversions. The law provides for imprisonment of up to 10 years and a maximum fine of Rs 50,000 under different categories."This is the first arrest under the new law. Accused Owais Ahmad was arrested from the Richha railway gate in the Bahedi area here on Wednesday. He was produced before a local court and was sent to 14 days judicial custody," Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police, Bareilly, Rajesh Kumar Pandey said.The case was registered at the Devarniya police station in Bareilly district on November 28 against Ahmad, officials said, adding that it was the first case to be registered in the state under the new law. Based on a complaint from Tikaram, a resident of Sharif Nagar village in Devarniya, the case was registered under sections of the Indian Penal Code and the anti-conversion law.The complainant has accused Ahmad, a resident of the same village, of trying to convert his daughter through "allurement", police said.According to the complaint, Tikaram's daughter and Ahmed studied together in Class 12.Three years ago, the accused started pressuring her to undergo religious conversion and perform 'nikaah' (marriage) with him, according to the complaint. But when the woman opposed, he threatened to kidnap her, Tikaram has said in his complaint.The complainant's daughter married someone else in June. However, Ahmed continued to harass her and her family members, he has alleged.Under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, which deals with different categories of offences, a marriage will be declared "null and void" if the conversion of a woman is solely for that purpose, and those wishing to change their religion after marriage need to apply to the district magistrate.The law was promulgated four days after the Yogi Adityanath government in the state approved the draft of the legislation which also curbs religious conversions only for the sake of marriage.

Even people of the same religion are not spared due to encouragement given to sectarian killing,” he said, referring to the reports of atrocities against religious minorities in the neighbouring country.He said India was troubled by the increase in resources, financial and otherwise, that are being made available to violent and terrorist groups that misuse religion to justify and propagate their agendas.“We need to be clear that abetting or condoning terrorism is like feeding a monster that will turn around to consume us,” he said.India called on the UN member states to fight such negative forces together, rather than separately. “Let us build a culture of peace together, rather than fail separately,” Sharma said.

Heavy barricades have already been placed at the protest sites.  Talks between the Centre and farmers demanding a rollback of the three recent farm sector legislations, ended inconclusively over the past few days with a new round about to take off at the Vigyan Bhawan.  IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/some-roads-to-delhi-closed-as-farmers-to-hold-talks-with-centre-179386
03-12-2020||New Delhi||ED carries out countrywide raids against PFI, its chairman in money laundering case||The ED on Thursday raided at least 26 premises in nine states linked to the Popular Front of India (PFI) including those of its chairman O M Abdul Salam and Kerala state chief Nasarudheen Elamarom as part of a money laundering probe, official sources said.     The searches are being conducted in Chennai, Tenkasi and Madurai (Tamil Nadu), Bengaluru, Darbhanga and Purnea (Bihar), Lucknow and Barabanki (Uttar Pradesh), Aurangabad in Maharashtra, Kolkata and Murshidabad (West Bengal), Jaipur, Shaheen Bagh area in Delhi and in Kochi, Malappuram and Thiruvananthapuram districts of Kerala under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), they said.They added the action was aimed at collecting evidence in multiple money laundering cases that have been clubbed into one and are being probed against the PFI and those linked to it.The premises of Salam and Elamarom, also PFI’s national secretary, are also being covered apart from some other office bearers of the organisation, they said.The central probe agency is investigating PFI’s “financial links” on alleged charges of fuelling the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests in the country, the Delhi riots that took place in February and few other instances.It had earlier recorded the statement of Salam, a senior assistant in the Kerala State Electricity Board, and a number of other PFI office-bearers in Delhi.Salam has been posted at the regional audit office of the Kerala electricity board in Manjeri town of Malappuram.PFI and Salam called the raids a gimmick and an attempt to divert attention from the farmers’ issue.“Simultaneous raids were carried out by ED at the houses of Popular Front national leaders across the country. We believe this to be a politically motivated action from the part of the agency. Such raids usually happen in our country whenever the government in power comes under the pressure of popular anger and it wants to divert national attention from it.”      “Modi government has always used national agencies against its political opponents and to crush dissent in the country to the point that the credibility of these agencies has come under question,” the organisation said in a statement.The central government has come under immense pressure following the farmers’ protests blockading Delhi and the ED raids are nothing but a “gimmick” to divert the issue, it said.It said authorities “intend to prevent the organisation from its fight against the anti-constitutional CAA-NRC, as it is a forerunner and stays a major force in the citizenship agitations across the country”.The PFI, formed in 2006 in Kerala and headquartered in Delhi, said its activities are “transparent” and out in the public and that they had nothing to hide. The ED, last month, had said it was investigating “financial links” between the PFI and Bhim Army in its money laundering case registered to investigate allegations of illegal funds being used to “fuel” the anti-CAA protests.“The ED is investigating financial links between PFI and Bhim Army on the basis of credible evidence recovered from senior PFI officials,” the agency had said in a tweet.The Bhim Army, led by its chief Chandrashekhar Azad, had told PTI that they were ready for all kinds of investigation.The agency is investigating the PFI under the PMLA since 2018.The ED had said that at least Rs 1.04 crore was deposited in several bank accounts linked to the organisation between December 4 last year and January 6 this year in various parts of the country.The sources had said a total amount of Rs 120 crore, credited to bank accounts linked to the PFI, are under the ED’s scanner.The sources had claimed that these dubious deposits were either made in cash or through the immediate payment service (IMPS) and a number of such instances were seen in Uttar Pradesh, where the maximum number of violent anti-CAA protests were reported to have taken place.Sources, quoting the ED findings, had said the withdrawal of money from the bank accounts linked to PFI and its related entities had a “direct correlation” with the violent demonstrations against the CAA.The ED had also sent a report in this connection to the Union Home Ministry.    The agency had arrested former Delhi Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain in August and alleged that cash received by him was used to “fuel” anti-CAA protests and the Delhi riots.“The probe revealed that companies owned and controlled by Tahir Hussain and his relatives transferred huge amounts of money to dubious entities and entry operators which was returned by them in cash,” it had said.“The cash received by Tahir Hussain through entry operators was used to fuel the anti-CAA protests and Delhi riots,” the agency had said in a statement.

The 24-hour average AQI was 373 on Wednesday. It was 367 on Tuesday, 318 on Monday and 268 on Sunday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".The predominant wind direction will be northerly and the maximum wind speed 6 kmph on Thursday, according to the India Meteorological Department.The minimum temperature was 8.2 degrees Celsius on Thursday and the maximum is expected to settle around 26 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.The minimum temperature this season has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.   The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said air quality is likely to remain in the "very poor" category till Saturday.There is a possibility of the air quality reaching the "severe" category between December 4 and December 7, it had said earlier.The city's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – is likely to be 3,000 m2/s on Thursday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-air-quality-remains-very-poor-179381

Last month, Pakistan arbitrarily transferred the management of the Sikh holy shrine, Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara, from the Sikh community body to the administrative control of a non-Sikh body,” First Secretary in India’s Permanent Mission to the UN Ashish Sharma said in the UN General Assembly on Wednesday.Sharma said this act went against Sikh religion and its preservation and protection. Sharma said the General Assembly would recall that the holy Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara finds mention in its resolution of December 2019.“That resolution stands violated by Pakistan,” he said.The UNGA resolution ‘Promotion of interreligious and intercultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace’ adopted in December last year “welcomes the initiative to open up the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor in the spirit of interfaith harmony and peaceful neighbourhood, and appreciates the agreement between the Governments of India and Pakistan to allow visa-free access to pilgrims of all faiths, especially ‘Nanak Naam Levas’ and the Sikh community from across the world, as a landmark initiative for interreligious and intercultural cooperation for peace.”India in November called Pakistan’s decision as “highly condemnable”, saying it runs against the religious sentiments of the Sikh community.“This unilateral decision by Pakistan is highly condemnable and runs against the spirit of the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor as also the religious sentiments of the Sikh community at large,” India had said.

03-12-2020||United Nations||UN has failed to acknowledge violence against Sikhism, Hinduism, Buddhism: India||Calling out the “selectivity” at the United Nations in condemning acts of violence against religions, India has said the UN General Assembly has failed to acknowledge the rising hatred and violence against Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and underlined that the culture of peace cannot be only for “Abrahamic” religions.Addressing the UN General Assembly session on ‘Culture of Peace’ on Wednesday, First Secretary in India’s Permanent Mission to the UN Ashish Sharma said there were “disconcerting trends” in the world of today.While India fully agreed that anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and anti-Christian acts needed to be condemned, and the country also firmly condemns such acts, he pointed out that the UN resolutions on such important issues spoke only of these three Abrahamic religions together.Also read: Pakistan must stop supporting terrorism to promote cultural peace in South Asia: India“This august body fails to acknowledge the rise of hatred and violence against Buddhism, Hinduism and Sikhism also,” Sharma said.“Culture of peace cannot be only for Abrahamic religions. And as long as such selectivity exists, the world can never truly foster a culture of peace,” he said.Asserting that the UN is not a body which should take sides when it comes to religion, Sharma said if “we are indeed selective”, the world would end up proving American political scientist Samuel Huntington’s ‘clash of civilisations’.“What we are trying to build here is an ‘alliance of civilisations’, not set up a clash. I call on the UN Alliance of Civilisation to act likewise and speak for all, not just a select few,” he said.Sharma recalled the shattering of the iconic Bamyan Buddha by fundamentalists in Afghanistan as well as the terrorist bombing of a gurdwara in the war-torn country in March, where 25 Sikh worshipers were killed, and the destruction of Hindu and Buddhist temples and minority cleansing of these religions by countries.He told the 193-member General Assembly that such acts call for condemning violence and attacks against the Buddhist, the Hindu and the Sikh religion also.“But the current member states refuse to speak of these religions in the same breath as the first three ‘Abrahamic’ religions. Why is this selectivity?” he asked.Sharma noted that overall, Hinduism had more than 1.2 billion followers, Buddhism had over 535 million followers and Sikhism around 30 million followers across the world.“It is time that attacks against these religions are also added to the earlier list of the three Abrahamic religions when such resolutions are passed,” he said.Key UN General Assembly resolutions over the years have categorically condemned and voiced concern over an increase in “anti-Semitism, Christianophobia and Islamophobia in various parts of the world”.However, violence against other religious minorities “get little more than a slap on the wrist”, a sentiment shared by several other countries also, sources said.Sharma told the General Assembly session that India was not just the birthplace of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, but was also the land where the teachings of Islam, Judaism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism had taken strong root and where the Sufi tradition of Islam has flourished.“Today, every one of the world’s major religions has a home in India,” he said.Sharma said for millennia, India had provided shelter to waves of those persecuted in foreign lands and allowed them to thrive in India. “And our tradition of inter-culture dialogue goes right to the time when ancient Indian thinkers had a flourishing dialogue with the ancient Greeks. India is not just a culture, but a civilisation in itself,” he added.Underlining that culture of peace is the cornerstone of the foundation of a global order of peace and tolerance, he said India had tried to foster this culture through tolerance, understanding, respect for differences, respect for other religions and cultures, respect for human rights, gender equality — all this under the overarching umbrella of pluralistic ethos and democratic principles.India on Wednesday co-sponsored a resolution presented by Bangladesh titled ‘Follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace’.The resolution reiterates that the objective of the effective implementation of the Programme of Action is to strengthen further the global movement for a culture of peace.It invites member states to continue to place greater emphasis on and expand their activities promoting a culture of peace at the national, regional and international levels and to ensure that peace and non-violence are fostered at all levels.

03-12-2020||---||As Shah meets Amarinder, govt contemplating new offer to farmers?||New Delhi, December 3As Home Minister Amit Shah met Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh here on Thursday afternoon, speculation is rife that the government is contemplating a new offer to farmers.It may include holding back the three Acts for a couple of months during which a committee, in which CMs and farmer representatives may be included, will hold talks.In the meeting ahead of farmers’ dialogue with Union ministers, Singh and Shah were expected to hold deliberations to work out an amicable solution to the problem.Also read: Appeal to farmers to resolve crisis, agitation impacting national security, Punjab economy: Amarinder 'Khalistani elements' hijacking farmers’ agitation, Amit Shah must act fast: Ravneet BittuDelhi police suggest alternative routes as farmers protest enters 8th dayPunjabi singers enliven atmosphere at farmers' protest in Haryana's BahadurgarhFarmers' sit-in at Noida-Delhi border continues; key route to Delhi closed for vehiclesFarmers protest: Heavy security cover at Delhi borders, traffic snarls reportedMeanwhile, regarding their meeting with the Union ministers, farmer leaders say they are concerned only with the Centre. It is not about any political party or the Punjab CM, it is about farmers of the entire country, and not just Punjab, they add.Sources say the government wants to resolve the issue as soon as possible.With farmers deciding to intensify the agitation, ahrtias, who are under constant attack from the Centre, have also decided to increase their participation in the agitation against the farm laws.Ahrtia Association president Ravinder Singh Cheema said an emergency meeting of the state body had decided that 100 buses of farmers, ahrtiyas and labourers would be brought to Delhi in the coming week. Every mandi president has been instructed to make arrangements to supply the buses.Earlier, it was decided that rations will be provided but with Haryana farmers and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee pitching in, the supply of food items from Punjab has been stopped.Apparently the government is also considering linking MSP to acreage. Farmers with smaller landholdings may be treated differently and there may also be some change in dispute redressal.Sources say the government is intent on a breakthrough on Thursday and Amit Shah may also join the meeting at some point.It remains to be seen whether farmers are ready to accept a somewhat softer approach by the Centre.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-shah-meets-amarinder-govt-contemplating-new-offer-to-farmers-179360

He was also a wonderfully generous human being. His work and example live on.”In a heartfelt tribute, leading academic and historian Irfan Habib said, “The passing away of Prof Datta deprives the Indian community of historians of one of its recognised stalwarts. He had made events and aspects of the national movement his special field and whatever he wrote on it had the quality of definitiveness about it. To me he coined in himself all values one associates with the old Punjab — a composite culture based on Urdu as the common literary language — alongside an uncompromising attachment to modern secular values.”Habib said Datta’s secular outlook came out clearly in everything he wrote whether on Sarmad, Jallianwalla Bagh, Azad or Iqbal.“It was a privilege to know him and learn at his feet,” he said.Datta’s long time colleague and historian JS Grewal remembered him fondly saying, “We have lost an eminent historian, a kind friend and a generous host. My association with Prof Datta is more than half a century old. Without yet knowing him personally, I was struck by his enthusiastic discussions in the Indian History Congress Sessions.”Noted litterateur Ashok Vajpeyi said, “Prof Datta was not only a scholar and teacher with unusual academic rigour and a deep-rooted vision, he was also an intellectual who shared a pluralistic legacy with many others.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/manmohan-singh-irfan-habib-guha-remember-historian-datta-179107

Their representatives are to meet Union Ministers regarding their demands on Thursday.Read also:  Meanwhile, Sangh-affiliate Swadesh Jagran Manch said the farmers needed an “assurance on price, an alternative ATM mechanism,” if middlemen/arhtiyas were to be removed, and a “better dispute redressal system”. Manch’s Ashwani Mahajan said while the intentions of the government could not be questioned, “any good thing has the scope for further improvement”.Capt to meet Shah ahead of talks todayThe Centre and Pb Govt are expected to work on a solution, with Capt Amarinder Singh set to meet Home Minister Amit Shah at his Delhi residence on Thursday, ahead of the Centre’s meeting with farmers. Some Cong leaders are wary of the turn the stir could take if prolonged. Sources said Capt might even attend the meeting with farmers to help break stalemate. TNS“Earlier, the arhtiyas would form cartels, now big players can do the same. Farmers need an assurance on MSP, either through amendments in the existing Acts or a new law,” he said. On the government stand that the support price was never a part of the legal system, he said: “It must be made obligatory for buyers to pay the floor price. The government can fix the floor price of crops, making a legal provision for it.” Agriculture Minister Tomar, who apprised Home Minister Amit Shah of the “inconclusive” Tuesday meeting, said he was hopeful of a breakthrough.

In the absence of efficacy testing on Indians, it is not possible to roll the vaccine out here. Pfizer has not asked for any trials in India yet,” a government source said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-okays-pfizer-vaccine-for-rollout-179051

03-12-2020||New Delhi||Top honey brands adulterated with sugar syrup: CSE||Honey sold by several major brands in the country has been found adulterated with sugar syrup, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) claimed on Wednesday.The CSE selected 13 top as well as smaller brands of processed and raw honey being sold to check their purity. It was found that 77 per cent of the samples were adulterated with sugar syrup. Of the 22 samples checked, only five passed all tests.‘China syrup used to bypass tests’The CSE investigation has claimed that “nefarious adulteration business of honey designed to bypass purity tests” could have “massive implications on our health during Covid-19 times”.Just three of 13 brands pass safety testInvestigations by the CSE with laboratory studies in India and Germany revealed the rampant adulteration. “Only three out of 13 brands passed the internationally accepted NMR test. Indian standards for honey purity cannot detect the adulteration because Chinese firms have designed sugar syrups to bypass these standards,” said the CSE.“This food fraud compromises public health in the Covid times. Indians today are consuming more honey because they believe in its anti-inflammatory properties to build immunity against the virus. But if it is adulterated, what we are actually eating is sugar, adding to the challenge of obesity, which in turn makes us more vulnerable to Covid-19,” said CSE Director General Sunita Narain. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/top-honey-brands-adulterated-with-sugar-syrup-cse-179054

03-12-2020||New Delhi||Six days after MiG-29K crash, pilot still missing||Six days after a MiG-29K fighter jet crashed over the Arabian Sea, a pilot, Lt Commander Nishant Singh, is still missing even as the Navy has expanded its search. The pilot had ejected along with his co-pilot, who was rescued within minutes after the crash on November 26.Third mishap in 12 monthsSources say so far there is no trace of the ejection seat or the parachute used by Lt Commander Singh. Besides, the locator beacon has not “pinged” — a word for sending a code signal. The other pilot who was rescued has reportedly told the Navy that he saw Lt Commander Singh eject from the jet, which was doing some 300 km per hour at the time of the crash.The rescued pilot was in the rear seat of the jet, while the one missing was in the front seat of the jet. When an ejection is triggered, the second seat ejects first followed by the one in the front. The process takes about a second to complete.An ejection and deployment of parachute is a complex procedure when carried out over sea. The pilot on hitting water has to unhook the parachute holding case from his body lest the weight of the chute pulls him down in the water. All Navy men, including pilots, are swimmers trained to swim under some tough conditions.The twin-engine jet had taken off from on board the “mother ship”, INS Vikramaditya, around 4.30 pm and was headed to INS Hansa, Goa, the home base for the 45-strong fleet of Russian-made jets.Divers of the Navy have located the debris of the aircraft some 50 km off Goa.Lt Commander Singh had got married in May to his long-time friend Nayyab Randhawa. Both are children of retired Naval officers. Nayyab’s father is settled in Mumbai, while Lt Commander Singh’s father stays in Noida.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/six-days-after-mig-29k-crash-pilot-still-missing-179104

Participation at the proposed event would have given a huge boost to Mamata’s stature when the Assembly elections in the state is just round the corner.In an email to the CM’s principal secretary Gautam Sanyal, Oxford Union president Beatrice apologised for the event not taking place as scheduled.However, the mail failed to throw light on why the programme, said to have been finalised back in July, could not be held as planned.Banerjee was supposed to answer questions online during the event which would have gone on air at 5 pm IST. She would have been the first Indian woman leader and head of a state government to have featured in an interview organised by OU.Mamata was not amused by the turn of events.The Trinamool Congress, without naming Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleged that “tremendous pressure” was brought upon the organisers by “the topmost levels” (of the Central government) leading to the cancellation of the programme.Oxford Union, a debating society, exists independently from the Oxford University and is separate from the Oxford University Student Union.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uks-oxford-union-cancels-mamatas-event-tmc-sniffs-political-pressure-179105
