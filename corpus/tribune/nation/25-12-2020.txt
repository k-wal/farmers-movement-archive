They say bigger the crime bigger the clarification and the prime minister is just doing that,” Surjewala said, claiming that the PM and his ministers are only giving “clarifications” without looking into the plight of farmers.“For a month, farmers are protesting near Delhi’s borders in this cold weather. Forty-four of them have already died due to various reasons but the pro-capitalist government is not moved,” senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala told reporters here on Friday.“The prime minister and the BJP government are working on the policy of wearing them down. The bitter truth is that the Modi government does not want to solve the farmers’ problem,” he claimed.Surjewala said the ruling party leaders are branding farmers as “Naxals, terrorists, Chinese and Pakistan agents, tukde-tukde gang”.“It is shameful that the minister of agriculture has gone to the extent of calling them political puppets in his letters. Instead of inventing excuses, indulging in event management, the Modi government should apologise to farmers and immediately withdraw these three black laws,” he said.The Congress stands shoulder-to-shoulder with farmers as it involved the question of lives and livelihoods of crores of farmers of this country, he said.“This is not a political fight, this is not the BJP versus Congress fight, not opposition versus ruling party fight,” he said.Surjewala said on six occasions farmers went to their doors with their pain and sought justice. “But it seems the government has made up its mind not to find a solution,” he said.Surjewala, who is Congress’ general secretary and chief spokesperson, said despite tall promises made to farmers, the truth was that not all farmer beneficiaries had been credited the amount under the PM-KISAN.“As per the 2015-16 agriculture census, 14.64 crore farmers in the country undertake cultivation on 15.78 crore hectares. The Modi government launched the Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojna in December 2018 in which it was stated that Rs 6,000 will be deposited into the accounts of all farmers in three instalments,” he said.“Under this scheme, in the year 2018-19, instead of Rs 88,000 crore, only Rs 6,005 crores was deposited. In 2019-20, Rs 49,196 crore was deposited and in 2020-21, Rs 38,872 crore has been given till date, whereas this amount should have been Rs 88,000 crore,” Surjewala added.Surjewala asked why the benefit of the scheme is being denied to around 5.40 crore farmers.“The truth is that the government is taking shelter behind political dishonesty, slyness and dramatics and is not at all interested in solving problems of farmers. Prime Minister Modi who dug up roads, attacked farmers with water cannons is today indulging in the drama of ‘samman nidhi’,” he alleged.On Friday, Modi had asserted that his government is willing to hold dialogues with all, including those staunchly opposed to it, as long as talks are based on farm issues, facts and logic.In a blistering speech targeting the Opposition, Modi said when the agitation began farmers had some genuine demands like guaranteed minimum support price but people with political motives then took over and began making unrelated demands like the release of those accused of violence and making highways toll-free.Modi’s address followed the release of over Rs 18,000 crore into accounts of more than nine crore farmer families under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojan. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-not-willing-to-solve-farmers-issues-wants-to-wear-them-down-congress-189304
25-12-2020||New Delhi||Muted Christmas in India as COVID-19 casts its shadow||The COVID-19 pandemic cast a shadow on Christmas celebrations this year as people followed strict protocols and celebrated the holiday in a low-key manner across the country.The peal of midnight bells in churches and carols reverberating in praise of Lord Jesus ushered in the yuletide spirit in Goa.The Christmas celebration in the state, where nearly 30 per cent population is Christian, started with traditional fervour amid strict adherence to the standard operating procedures (SOPs) laid down by the state government.“People came out in large numbers to attend the midnight mass. However, only 200 people were allowed to attend the mass in each church and the attendees had to maintain physical distance, wear masks and sanitise their hands,” a priest attached to Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church in Panaji said on Friday.The festival will continue till the New Year, the priest added.At some places, special pandals were set up outside the churches to accommodate those people who could not attend the mass inside.Apart from the churches and chapels, people also thronged the beaches across the state at midnight. Markets in the state were seen packed with items used to decorate cribs, depicting the birth of Lord Jesus.For the first time since Christianity was introduced in the picturesque state of Mizoram in 1890s, the traditional way of celebrating Christmas was shunned due to COVID-19 protocols in place across the state.Traditionally, church service, carols, congregational gatherings called “Zaikhawm” in local parlance (singing Christmas songs and hymns in group) and community feast form  dominated Mizoram.This year the state government has banned all such practices to prevent further spread of coronavirus.Churches of different denominations, held online programmes through local cable televisions and other media platforms to convey Christmas messages to the people.Presbyterian Church, the largest denomination in the state, has been organising Christmas live crusade through local cable TV since Christmas eve delivering sermons and singing Christmas songs to cheer up the people.On Friday, different churches organised online church service through TV and Zoom.As community feasts were not possible this year, some churches donated their contributed money (for community feast) to the needy while other churches used it for buying meat for them.Some families collected Christmas offerings, which they donated to the poor.A Young Mizo Association (YMA) leader said many groups, NGOs and individuals reached out to the poor, orphanages and rehabs with alms to convey the message of peace and love to the people to mark the celebration.In Tamil Nadu, churches saw devotees offering prayers strictly adhering to all the protocols.Members of the Christian community, while maintaining social distancing norms and wearing masks, attended midnight masses and special prayers held in various churches, including the ancient Santhome Basilica here and exchanged greetings.Devotees were directed to collect tokens before entering churches so as to ensure limited number of them were allowed were present in view of the pandemic.Christians decorated their houses with Christmas tree and stars. Children carried candles and the Bible in small processions in their respective neighbourhoods.The Shrine Basillica of Our Lady of Health at Vailankannai in Nagapattinam district also saw devotees offering prayers following the norms laid down in view of the pandemic.Nagaland celebrated Christmas with religious fervour and joy with many churches holding live online Christmas services due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The midnight services on Thursday welcoming the birth of Jesus was limited to lesser congregations in Churches following the COVID-19 protocols.In the state capital Kohima, while many churches cancelled the main celebrations with masses in church premises, several conducted live online Christmas services and held special mass in churches with gathering of believers in phases.The Christian community in Kerala on Friday celebrated Christmas with traditional fervour and piety, but all festivities and rituals were performed in compliance with COVID protocols.Cutting across age barriers, devotees including children and senior citizens, could be seen wearing masks and cleansing hands with sanitisers before entering church halls for attending special prayers and midnight mass.Devotees as well as clergy maintained social distancing strictly in a majority of churches and cathedrals.As church bells tolled signalling the moment of nativity, the devotees congregated for midnight service in churches across the southern state where senior bishops and priests conducted special masses and gave out the Christmas message.However, the usual vibrant festivities on Christmas eve including mass carols were missing in many places in the state due to the COVID alert.While Cardinal Mar Baselios Cleemis led the midnight mass at St Mary’s Cathedral of Syro Malankara Catholic Church at Pattam here, Archbishop Soosa Pakiyam led prayers at the St Joseph’s Metropolitan Cathedral at Palayam here.Syro Malabar Catholic Church Major Archbishop Cardinal George Alenchery led the service and gave out the Christmas message at St Mary’s Basilica in Ernakulam.The state’s commercial hub Kochi saw a different Christmas celebration this time as a group of devotees rode bicycles from Edappally to Nedumbassery marking the festival occasion. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/muted-christmas-in-india-as-covid-19-casts-its-shadow-189299

25-12-2020||Jaipur||BJP ignores Muslims but uses one to destabilse my government: Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday accused the BJP of “using” a Muslim leader in an attempt to topple his government while ignoring the community when it comes to fielding election candidates.He made the charge while accusing BJP Rajya Sabha MP Syed Zafar Islam of being involved in alleged horse-trading during the revolt in July by a group of Congress MLAs led by former deputy CM Sachin Pilot.Gehlot said “not one ticket” was given to Muslim candidates during the last Assembly elections in the Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, and yet, he added, “A Muslim was being used to bring down the government.”       But he did not elaborate on the MP's alleged role during the attempt to "destabilise" his government earlier this year.The Chief Minister alleged that Union Ministers Amit Shah, Dharmendra Pradhan and Gajendra Singh Shekhawat were among those involved in the “conspiracy” to destabilise the state's Congress government.Addressing a press conference here, Gehlot claimed he had proof that the state BJP leadership was also involved.Replying to another question on Pilot's rebellion, the CM said, “Forget and forgive.”The Congress leadership in Delhi intervened to patch up the differences between the two factions after Pilot and 18 other MLAs rebelled.The BJP has in the past rejected the charge against it, saying the Gehlot was blaming the opposition for a problem within the ranks of his own party.Gehlot had called the press conference on Friday to highlight the achievements of his government in the last two years.AICC general secretary Ajay Maken, Pradesh Congress Committee president Govind Singh Dotasra and state ministers were also present.Reacting to the claim that his government has not fulfilled the election promise of waiving farm loans, Gehlot said the opposition was misleading people.He said loans from cooperative and land development banks had been waived but the nationalised banks were under the Reserve Bank of India, and asked why the Centre didn't intervene in this.He said the state government had even offered to shell out 50 per cent of the amount involved in waivers by nationalised banks.He also accused the BJP government at the Centre not caring about the concerns of farmers who were protesting against the farm laws.Dotasra said the party would begin on Monday a ‘Kisan Samvad’ – programme of meetings with farmers across the state.

25-12-2020||KV Prasad||Vajpayee memorial lecture: India-US should pair strategy to engage realities of Indo-Pacific, says US policy specialist||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 25Advocating a stronger push for increased bilateral engagement between the United States and India, a senior US policy specialist on Friday said geo-political ambitions of New Delhi and Washington need to be paired for a strategy to engage the emerging realities of the Indo-Pacific.“With the incoming Biden-Harris administration, there will be a renewed focus on restoring our global alliances and strengthening our global institutions,” said Nisha Biswal, president of the US-India Business Council,  while addressing the inaugural Atal Behari Memorial Lecture organised by the Ministry of External Affairs.“The advances of the past four years and the strategic convergence which we have seen deepened in the current administration will continue but they need to be buttressed with a broader focus on our shared democratic values.“And our geopolitical ambitions need to be paired with a firm grasp and strategy for engaging the geo-economic realities of the Indo-Pacific,” she said.Recounting the upward trajectory of the relationship since the time Vajpayee was at the helm of affair, Nisha said, Prime Minister Vajpayee was able to foresee what many others failed to see.He saw the potential dangers posed by a rising and unchecked China. And he saw the importance of a US-India partnership, built on the foundation of our democratic values, to advance a rules-based order that would enable a more peaceful, prosperous and pluralistic Asia, she said. Today, she said, the geo-economics realities were such that for either the United States or India to succeed and be competitive with the production capacity and efficiency of China would require working together by both the countries and develop more effective and efficient economy in respective countries.Biswal, who served in the Obama administration, said as the two large economies both the United States and India were outside of the two major trading blocks in Asia and trade policy in democracies were neither easy nor politically popular.“Despite the fact that we have not been able to conclude even a small agreement between our two countries, we have seen the promise of a growing economic partnership drive greater trade and investment in both the US and India,” she said suggesting it was time to build on the successes and deepen economic convergence, requiring partnership across sectors.Biswal also suggested that both countries institutionalise deepening relations between the US Congress and Indian Parliament, connect state and city leaders in a meaningful way.  In his opening remarks, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar described Vajpayee as a transformational leader. “… when it came to Indian foreign policy.”“He had an intuitive understanding that the post-Cold War world required India to drastically rework its relationships and interests. This vision led to a new beginning with the United States that has since been developed by successive governments on both sides,” he said.“It required us, as a nation, to overcome difficult moments and continuing concerns. Only someone with Atalji’s enormous self-assurance could, in the early days, have visualised how natural this partnership would become,” Jaishankar pointed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vajpayee-memorial-lecture-india-us-should-pair-strategy-to-engage-realities-of-indo-pacific-says-us-policy-specialist-189278

I personally have written two letters and have even spoken to the minister concerned two days ago but they are refusing to cooperate and are instead indulging in malicious propaganda for political gains,” said Mamata, who wants Central government to transfer the PM-Kisan funds to state government for onward distribution to farmers.Mamata said that when West Bengal Government was implementing so many schemes in the state with Central Government, the question of not cooperating on a scheme that was benefitting farmers seemed absurd.The Trinamool Congress chief alleged that the Central Government was indulging in politicking, disregarding the established procedure of implementation of central schemes in states.Mamata said that for all the posturing of the Central Government, the fact was that the Modi Government had done nothing to help West Bengal.“They are yet to release even a portion of the Rs 85,000 crore of outstanding dues that includes unpaid GST dues of Rs 8,000 crore. If he genuinely wants to help the state, he must release at least a part of these funds,” the statement quoted Mamata as saying.The West Bengal CM went on to question the usefulness of the PM-Kisan Yojana and said even if a scheme was designed to give political mileage to Modi and not driven by any desire to help people, she would still welcome it if it meant “incremental benefit for the people of Bengal”.Mamata’s refusal to accept various central schemes has emerged as an important issue in the run-up to the Assembly elections in the state slated to take place early next year.Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who recently visited the state, also claimed that more than 80 welfare schemes meant for marginalised sections had been blocked in West Bengal by the Mamata Banerjee regime.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-accuses-modi-of-abandoning-procedure-on-central-schemes-189270

When Inspector Rao and Constable B Arun opened the door, Nihal, Shanthi and Nirmal poured some inflammable substance on them and set them afire.Two cases were registered in this regard—first on the complainant of Sub-inspector Ch Sailu for assaulting and abusing government officials under sections 353, 332, and 186 read with 34 of IPC, and another on the complaint of Jawaharnagar Municipal Commissioner Mangamma for an attempt to murder police personnel with a pre-hatched plan under sections 332, 333, 353, 307, and 504 read with 34 of the IPC.The investigation is being monitored by DCP, Malkajgiri. — ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/inspector-constable-set-ablaze-by-illegal-occupants-of-government-land-in-telangana-189266
25-12-2020||Amethi||Rahul Gandhi lying and misleading farmers: Smriti Irani||Union minister Smriti Irani launched a scathing attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, accusing him of “lying and misleading” farmers over the Centre’s recent farm laws.Addressing a farmers’ rally in her parliamentary constituency Amethi, Irani said, “Rahul Gandhi is telling lies and misleading farmers.”           “He is shedding crocodile tears for farmers and misleading them. His own jija (brother-in-law) has encroached upon land of farmers,” she alleged, in an apparent reference to charges levelled against Robert Vadra by political rivals.Irani’s attack on Gandhi comes amid protests by farmers on various border points of Delhi against the Centre’s recent farm laws.Throwing a challenge at Gandhi for a debate on farmer issues, Irani asked him to come in the midst of farmers here and claimed that she would expose him for “every single sin” committed by him.The Union minister addressed the rally in Singhpur block in Tiloi as part of a mega exercise undertaken by the BJP to reach out to farmers as Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday released over Rs 18,000 crore to more than nine crore farmer families under the ‘Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi’ (PM-KISAN).While putting up a strong defence of the three new farm laws, Modi on Friday said the Centre is willing to resume the dialogue on all farmers-related issues, even with those staunchly opposed to his government as long as the talks are based on issues, facts and logic.Irani said Gandhi, whom she defeated in the last parliamentary election, is showing sympathy for farmers now, but he himself has “grabbed” the land of farmers.“The kind of development which had taken place before I came here is known to all. This family had knowingly kept Amethi and its farmers away from development. They kept misleading them, enjoyed the fruits of power sitting in Delhi and lived in a palace of gold,” she alleged.Irani alleged that the Gandhi family did not think about the development of Amethi after winning elections.She also listed various development works undertaken after the BJP formed government in Delhi.Talking to reporters later, Irani said, “The Congress is misleading farmers by telling a lie that MSP and mandis will come to an end, only for political gains”.The farmers of the country want to move towards adopting new techniques to increase their income but this is troubling the Congress, she said.She also cited how various schemes of the state and central governments have benefitted the farmers of Amethi. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-lying-and-misleading-farmers-smriti-irani-189262

The other two were conducted in mid-February and early March, before the COVID-19 lockdown was imposed. The 20-year-old youth, a resident of West Delhi, suffered from congenital heart defect, a condition known as Ebstein’s anomaly. Because of this, his heart had become very weak and its right section was not able to pump blood.He had been visiting AIIMS for almost four years for treatment.“In the last six months, his condition deteriorated. He had become very sick and bed-ridden and urgently needed a heart transplant,” Dr Milind Hote, a professor in the Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery, said.“We received information from National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation about the availability of a donor heart from Gujarat,” Dr Hote said.An AIIMS team went to Vadodara on Thursday morning, retrieved the heart and flew back to Delhi by afternoon. It was then transplanted in the youth following a nearly seven-hour-long surgery.The Delhi Police created an 18-km-long green corridor for the ambulance carrying the heart from the city airport to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here. It took just 12 minutes to transport the heart from the Terminal two of the airport to the hospital.“The youth is admitted in the ICU after the surgery, and his condition is stable,” Dr Hote said.“The entire exercise was coordinated by the Organ Retrieval Banking Organization, AIIMS. The Indigo team and the Delhi Police acted promptly and extended their full support to ensure the harvested heart reached from the donor hospital to AIIMS within a short time,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/20-year-old-man-gets-new-lease-of-life-after-heart-transplant-at-aiims-189257
25-12-2020||Beijing||China says no ‘link’ between stranded Indian ship crew and its strained ties with India, Australia||China said on Friday that there was no “link” between the situation of Indian crew on two stranded ships at Chinese ports and its strained relations with India and Australia.The External Affairs Ministry said in New Delhi on Thursday that two cargo vessels with a total of 39 Indians on board have been on anchorage in Chinese waters as they were not allowed to unload their cargo though some other ships have managed to do so.“There is a considerable amount of stress on the crew members on account of this unprecedented situation,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.Srivastava said bulk cargo vessel MV Jag Anand is on anchorage near Jingtang port in Hebei province of China since June 13 and it has 23 Indian sailors.Another vessel, MV Anastasia with 16 Indian nationals as its crew, is on anchorage near Caofeidian port in China since September 20, waiting for discharge of its cargo, he said at a media briefing.“Our Embassy in Beijing has been in constant touch with provincial and central government authorities in China, requesting that the ships be allowed to dock and/or the crew be allowed to be changed,” he said.Asked about India’s concern relating to the Indian crew members of the ships and whether China’s decision on this issue has related to the current situation between India, China and Australia, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing on Friday “we stated repeatedly that China has clear stipulations on quarantine measures”.“Concerning this, China has stayed in close communication with the Indian side and responding to their requests as well as providing necessary assistance for them,” he said.“As far as I understand, China allows the crew change while meeting certain quarantine conditions. But this Jingtang port is not in the list for such crew changes,” he said.Wang however, did not refer to the 16 crew members of Caofeidian port.“For more specifics, you may refer to the competent and local authorities,” he said.“As to whether this has anything to do with the bilateral relations, I don’t see any link,” he added.The relations between India and China were under stress over the current military standoff at Eastern Ladakh. The ties between Australia and China in the past few months nose-dived after Canberra barred Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies from its national 5G network over national security concerns.China also resented Canberra’s push for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus in April. Reports from Australia say China has been restricting a number of Australian exports, including coal.China last month blamed the freight forwarder of Jag Anand’ ship for the impasse, saying he is not letting the ship to leave. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-says-no-link-between-stranded-indian-ship-crew-and-its-strained-ties-with-india-australia-189254

25-12-2020||New Delhi||‘Gol gappa’ langar by seven firemen from Haryana at farmers’ protest site a hit||On Christmas Day, a group of seven firemen from Sirsa in Haryana began distributing free ‘gol gappa’ at the farmers’ protest site in Singhu border, and the stock was over within half-an-hour.What prompted Surender Kamboj and his friends to start this novel langar was seeing a child loitering near a stall selling ‘gol gappa’. He could not help but ask the child what he wanted.“’Gol gappa’, said the boy who did not have any money,” recalls the 33-year-old fire service personnel. What happened next amazed the child and the farmers in nearby trolleys.Kamboj and his friends from the Rania fire station bought the entire stock of the seller and started a ‘gol gappa’ langar at the spot.“The gol gappa seller had not earned anything as people have been eating at langars (community kitchen). He could sell his stock and we got a chance to do ‘sewa’ (service). It was a win-win situation for everybody,” said Ravindra Kumar, another fire service personnel from Rania.Kumar said seven fire service personnel, including him, have come to the site to support the agitating farmers. “We are a team of 21 personnel at the Rania fire station. We have decided to come to the Singhu border in three batches.”            The fire service personnel said they had permission from the head of the station to participate in the protest. A new batch will come in after every three days, they said.“All of us own agricultural land in our villages. All of us are farmers,” Davinder Singh, another fireman said. “Fire service is a responsible profession. But fighting for the rights of farmer community is a responsibility, too,” Kamboj added.It was a Christmas miracle for Mohammad Salim, the ‘gol gappa’ seller, who said Kamboj gave him Rs 1,000 which was more than what he expected.He had earned just Rs 500 in the last three days.“Everything is available for free at the langar. Anything that you would think of. Initially, I did not set up the stall thinking the protest would end in a few days. But it continued. I could not have stayed home forever,” said the 26-year-old resident of Kundli village. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gol-gappa-langar-by-seven-firemen-from-haryana-at-farmers-protest-site-a-hit-189251

It was convened to finalise the "rules" under the Codes for their implementation.The Codes have been enacted into laws by Parliament. They can be implemented only after the notification of the proposed Rules.As many as 10 Left-leaning and the ones traditionally opposed to BJP, boycotted the meeting, but the RSS-affiliate BMS—the biggest among the unions—and three others attended it.Those who skipped the meeting are INTUC, AITUC, CITU, HMS, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, UTUC and LPF.On the contrary, besides BMS, factions of INTUC and TUCC and NFITU attended the event.During the meeting, the BMS demanded that the wage definition limiting allowances to 50 per cent of total salary should not be frozen under the Wage Code.BMS national functionary Pawan Kumar, who attended the meeting, said it was also demanded to scrap of spread over to 12 hours (working hours against the present about nine hours).Also, the family should consist of six units to calculate minimum wages.The BMS also rooted for reinstatement of Wage Board for Journalists, etc.It also protested against proposed categorisation of "metro", "non-metro" and "rural" rates as they will promote regional inequality leading to migrant workers to metros for higher wages.Concerning the Code on Industrial Relations, the BMS protested against the restriction on unions' activities at workplaces.CITU's national secretary Amitava Guha said that the 10 unions did not attend the meeting because the government tried to wrap up the discussions in just one day.The four Codes relate to Wages, Industrial Relations, Social Security, and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sharp-divisions-among-central-trade-unions-on-labour-codes-189234
25-12-2020||New Delhi||Tomar urges Punjab farmers to end protest, resume talks||Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday urged Punjab farmers to end their protest and come forward to hold discussions with the government to resolve the deadlock over the three new farm laws.Tomar, who is leading the talks with 40 farmers unions, hoped that farmers would understand the importance of these three legislations and would hold discussion with the government to reach a solution to break this stalemate.Stating that there is some misconception in minds of Punjab farmers, the Agriculture Minister said: "I want to urge them to leave the protest and come forward for the dialogue. I am hopeful that farmers will understand the importance of new laws and reach a solution."Thousands of farmers and their family members are protesting at various Delhi borders for nearly a month seeking repeal of the three farm laws. So far, five rounds of formal talks between the Centre and 40 protesting farmer unions have remained inconclusive.The government has written twice inviting them for the next round of talks at a date of their convenience.Besides Tomar, Food, Commerce and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash are participating in the discussion with the 40 farmer unions.The protesting groups have maintained that the new laws will eliminate the safety net of the minimum support price (MSP), do away with the mandi (wholesale market) system and leave them at the mercy of big corporates.However, the government has been saying that these apprehensions are misplaced.

25-12-2020||New Delhi||Bus ride to Lahore with Vajpayee: When Kapil Dev was most gracious and Dev Anand went down memory lane||A host of luminaries from different fields were on the bus that took Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the historic journey from Amritsar to Lahore in 1999 but cricketer Kapil Dev was perhaps the most gracious, recalls the late prime minister's private secretary Shakti Sinha in a new book.It took 40 minutes for the bus to go from the Indian side of the Punjab to the Pakistani side and the seat next to Vajpayee on that momentous ride was a much coveted one."The bus had two seats on either side of the aisle. Vajpayee was on the first seat on the left side of the bus, all by himself. Throughout the short forty-minute journey, we provided an opportunity for each member of the delegation to sit with Vajpayee and chat for a while.                "Kapil Dev came across as the most gracious, quickly moving out when it was the turn of somebody else to sit with Vajpayee. With some of the others, I had to almost physically evict them; they shall not be named as they are not with us anymore," Sinha writes in "Vajpayee: The Years that Changed India" that hit the stands on Friday, the late leader's 96th birth anniversary.Among the others accompanying Vajpayee on the journey were journalist Kuldip Nayar, poet Javed Akhtar, actor Dev Anand, singer Mahendra Kapoor and actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha.  Sinha also has a tale to tell about the late Dev Anand, who has legions of fans in Pakistan.When the bus reached the other side of the border, the two prime ministers, Vajpayee and Nawaz Sharif, hugged each other. Dev Anand, who stood next to them, started reminiscing about the time when he left Lahore for Mumbai."… (he) would have carried on till we gently guided him away," Sinha says.The prime minister's motorcade gets a free pass on the roads but a car carrying his hearing aid does not, he says, recounting the delay at the beginning of the journey in Delhi.On the way to the airport in Delhi to board the flight to Amritsar, Vajpayee realised he had forgotten his hearing device at home."On our way to the airport, Vajpayee turned to me and nervously told me that he had left his hearing device at home. He had been checking his pockets and found them empty! Fortunately, we had cell phones by then, so I quickly rang back and asked for it to be sent pronto," Sinha writes.".. fortunately for us, the PM's plane, operated by the air force, always has sufficient margin, a fact I knew by then. That knowledge gave us breathing space. We boarded but could not leave immediately since the car with the hearing aid was still on the way. But we were lucky that the traffic was light and the delay was a manageable twenty minutes," he adds.       The inaugural bus, 'Sada-e-sarhad', ran on February 19, 1999 between Delhi and Lahore, a distance of around 500 km, with three technical halts, taking a total of 14 hours.Though Vajpayee was to travel all the way from Delhi, the plan was later modified and he boarded the bus at Amritsar airport.Sinha, who is presently the director of Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Policy Research and International Studies, MS University, Vadodara, also says Pakistan's then prime minister Sharif sent a word to his wife Begum Kulsoom Nawaz to drive from Islamabad to Lahore when he noticed that Vajpayee's foster daughter Namita Kaul Bhattacharya was part of the delegation.Namita Kaul's husband Ranjan Bhattacharya and their daughter Niharika were also part of the tour.  "This indicated how much Vajpayee was personally invested in the visit, raising the tenor of the occasion by a few octaves," Sinha writes      The 'bus diplomacy', as it was called in later years, was hailed as the dawn of a new era in India-Pakistan relations but proved to be a short-lived thaw in the stormy relationship between the two countries. Within months India and Pakistan were embroiled in the Kargil battle.The over 300-page book, which consists of 10 chapters, is published by Penguin Random House India.

25-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmer unions to meet again on Saturday on Centre's offer on fresh talks offer||The protesting farmer unions met on Friday to discuss the government's latest letter inviting them for talks, with some of them indicating that they may decide to resume their dialogue with the Centre to find a solution to the ongoing deadlock over the three contentious agri laws.The unions said they will hold another meeting on Saturday where a formal decision on the Centre's invite for the resumption of stalled talks is likely to be taken.An official in the Union ministry of agriculture and farmers' welfare also said the government was expecting the next round of meeting to take place in the next two-three days.One of the protesting union leaders, who did not wish to be named, said their demand for a legal guarantee on minimum support price will, however, remain the same."We have another meeting tomorrow to take a decision on the Centre's letter. In this meeting, we may decide to resume talks with the government as it appears through its previous letters that it has not been able to understand our issues so far," the leader said.He said the government's letters have no proposals, the reason why farmer unions may decide to hold fresh talks and make it understand their demands."MSP cannot be separated from our demand of repealing these three laws. In these laws, there is mention about private mandis. Who will ensure that our crop is sold at fixed MSP if it is not there?" another leader asked.On Friday, several farmer unions held a meeting, but no decision could be taken on the Centre's latest letter.On Thursday, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare Vivek Aggarwal wrote to the protesting unions and invited them for fresh talks, but made it clear that it would not be "logical" to include in the agenda any new demand related to the MSP, which is out of the purview of the three new farm laws.On Wednesday, the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 40 unions protesting at three Delhi border points --- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- for the last 28 days, had asked the government to not repeat the proposal of "meaningless" amendments that they have already rejected but to come up with a "concrete offer" in writing for the resumption of talks.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee Friday demanded that the Centre arrange trains so that farmers from different parts of the country reach the ongoing protests at Delhi's border points, adding that they are ready to pay the cost of tickets for all peasants.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi squarely blamed those with a political agenda for the deadlock in the Centre's talks with the protesting farmers and asserted that his government was willing to hold dialogues with all, including those staunchly opposed to it, as long as talks are based on farm issues, facts and logic.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.Also read: Modi releases over Rs 18,000 crore to more than 9 crore farmers Farmers occupy toll plazas across Haryana in protest against agri lawsMore protesters joinMeanwhile thousands more farmers joined protests at the Ghazipur border, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee said. A statement from AIKSCC media cell said 5,000 farmers had joined the protests in Ghazipur, and more were expected to join.Farmers had blocked traffic on both sides of the road at Shahjahanpur.  The statement also added that 1,000 farmers from Maharashtra had also joined the protests.--- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmer-unions-to-meet-again-on-saturday-on-centres-offer-on-fresh-talks-offer-189220
