17-12-2020||New Delhi||AIIMS unable to find required no. of volunteers for phase-3 trial of Bharat Biotech’s COVID vaccine||The AIIMS here is unable to find the required number of volunteers for the phase-3 trial of Bharat Biotech’s COVID-19 vaccine, with officials saying people are unwilling to participate in the exercise thinking why take part in a trial when a vaccine would be available soon for everybody.The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the national capital is one of the sites conducting the final phase of the trial of the vaccine, “Covaxin”, and it needs around 1,500 volunteers for the purpose.Covaxin has been indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“We wanted 1,500-2,000 participants but so far, we have been able to recruit only around 200 participants. People are unwilling to participate in the exercise thinking why take part in a trial when a vaccine would be available soon for everyone,” Dr Sanjay Rai, professor in the department of community medicine at the AIIMS and also the principal investigator of the study, said.He said volunteers are opting out when the procedure, about it being a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial in which 50 per cent would be administered the shot while the other 50 per cent would receive the placebo, is being explained to them.“People are refusing to participate in the clinical trial after knowing about the procedure, saying why take part in a trial when a vaccine would be available soon,” Dr Rai said.He said when the phase-1 trial was to begin, they needed 100 participants but received over 4,500 applications.Even during the phase-2 trial, the hospital received around 4,000 applications.Dr Rai said people should come forward to participate in the trial and they are planning to raise awareness through advertisements, e-mails and phone calls on why it is important to take part in the clinical trial to get a safe and efficacious vaccine.According to the “COVID-19 Vaccine Operational Guidelines”, which have been issued to the states by the Centre recently, the COVID-19 vaccine will be offered first to healthcare workers, frontline workers and those above 50 years of age, followed by those below 50 years of age with associated comorbidities, based on the evolving pandemic situation, and finally, to the remaining population, based on the disease epidemiology and vaccine availability.The priority group of above 50 years may further be subdivided into those above 60 years of age and those between 50 and 60 years of age for phasing of the rollout, based on the pandemic situation and vaccine availability.“The latest electoral roll for Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly elections will be used to identify the population aged 50 years or more,” the guidelines stated.In the first phase of the vaccination, it is planned to vaccinate nearly 30 crore people.Twelve photo-identity documents, including Voter ID card, Aadhaar card, driving licence, passport and pension documents will be required for self-registration on the Co-WIN website.

17-12-2020||New Delhi/Kolkata||Government to press ahead with PSU stake sale: FM||The government will press ahead with the sale of public sector companies that have been approved by the Cabinet, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday.Highlighting that the FDI flow into India is much higher compared to other emerging economies, she said India's strong macroeconomic fundamentals, ability to do reforms and a stable government help attract long-term foreign funds into Indian businesses."Even during the pandemic, our efforts to disinvest some of those big companies are going on fine. The EoIs have come in, the next stage is going on and even within this financial year I expect DIPAM to be able to prove that they are even more actively engaging in those disinvestments for which Cabinet has already given approval," Sitharaman said while addressing the AGM of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.The government has set an ambitious Rs 2.01 lakh crore disinvestment target in the current fiscal. However, COVID-19 pandemic has derailed the stake sale plans and so far over Rs 11,006 crore has been mopped up from minority stake sale in various CPSEs.The Cabinet has approved strategic sale, along with transfer of management control, in over 25 public sector companies, including Air India , BPCL, Pawan Hans, Scooters India, Bharat Earth Movers Ltd (BEML), Shipping Corporation, Cement Corporation and some steel plants of SAIL.The process of sale of BPCL and Air India is ongoing and the government has received "multiple expressions of interest" in these two companies.Sitharaman mentioned that the government had taken several measures to support the economy but no amount of intervention would be adequate to deal with the crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.The Finance Minister said public expenditure would continue particularly for infrastructure and with the tax concessions that the government had doled out, several sovereign funds and pension funds were keen to invest in infrastructure projects outlined in the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)."Today we are able to see with all the tax concessions that we have given, several sovereign funds and pension funds from abroad are keen to come to India, and that kind of an investment readiness explains why there is an inward FDI flow into India. Inward FDI flow into India is much, much higher in proportion than compared comparable economies, emerging economies..."So they (foreign funds) are committed to be here. They are coming in because our macroeconomic fundamentals are strong, even as there are challenges, but more importantly there is an elected stable government."A government which is looking at progressive reforms, a government which does not shy away from taking very strong decisions. And a government which has made very clear that the disinvestment agenda, for which the cabinet has given clearance, will go on," she said.Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) during April-September 2020, increased 13 per cent to about USD 40 billion.With regard to Aatmanirbhar Bharat, the minister said the government did not want to support import of those goods or services which the domestic industry was producing and providing."We are conscious that raw material support, intermediary goods support will have to carry on, we will continue with that," she said.The minister said post lockdown every department of the government was functioning with a greater element of "wanting to be nimble" and asked the industry to give their suggestions."...We are seeing clear signs of revival across the board, but for it to sustain I need to understand from you, the industry leaders, as to what exactly you are looking at..."      "Even as we are going towards the making of the next Budget after an extraordinary year, challenges have been very different,” she said."Public expenditure will continue and at a better pace. Public expenditure, meaning capital expenditure from the public sector undertakings, particularly for infrastructure will be kept up. Government's expenditure and for infrastructure is something which we are very much into...," Sitharaman added.

17-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||Tomar pens open letter to farmers; CIFA writes to CJI seeking permission to submit views||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 17Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday wrote an eight-page open letter to farmers, reiterating benefits of the three Farm Acts while cautioning them against those trying to mislead them, urging them “with folded hands” to consider the facts without any outside influence. Tomar said the government is ready to give a written assurance on MSP and address their concerns in the three laws. Stating that most of the farmers are happy with the new farm bills, he said confusion has been created by a certain section as part of a conspiracy. Tomar also said as someone belonging to a farmer’s family he is well aware of the hardships they face as farmers.This on a day the Supreme Court asked the Centre if it was ready to defer implementation of the three laws that have led to the massive protests by farmers. Tomar’s letter followed a meeting by the BJP’s top brass, apparently to discuss the future course of action amid growing negative perceptions as agitating farmers brave cold, hostile conditions on Delhi borders.सभी किसान भाइयों और बहनों से मेरा आग्रह !"सबका साथ सबका विकास सबका विश्वास" के मंत्र पर चलते हुए प्रधानमंत्री श्री @narendramodi जी के नेतृत्व में हमारी सरकार ने बिना भेदभाव सभी का हित करने का प्रयास किया है। विगत 6 वर्षों का इतिहास इसका साक्षी है।#ModiWithFarmers pic.twitter.com/Ty6GchESUG  Apparently, the SC indication for setting up a committee with experts, representatives of the government and farmers’ bodies on board to resolve the deadlock is something that may be suitable for the government which is clear that neither repeal nor legislating on the MSP is an option. While the government is offering concessions, protesters outside its doors at the Delhi borders is a situation it will like to end soon. As part of the outreach, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to address farmers in Madhya Pradesh tomorrow. So far as SC’s observations today go BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi said: “I am not aware of these exact observations so I will not comment.  I will only say that so far as the Centre is concerned it had made wide discussions across the country. Anyone in the country who has anything to say is always welcome and the Centre will always welcome any steps for an open and transparent consultation.”Meanwhile, P Chengal Reddy of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations has written to the Chief Justice of India, requesting that “CIFA members and other farmers associations supporting farm reforms initiated by Sharad Joshi and included in Dr M.S. Swaminadan report” be allowed to submit their views before the Supreme Court.  On the other hand, a group of leading economists appealed to the government “to withdraw the Acts and hold extensive consultations with farmer organisations and other stakeholders on what measures would really bring equitable and sustainable benefit to the farmers and the economy”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tomar-pens-open-letter-to-farmers-cifa-writes-to-cji-seeking-permission-to-submit-views-185685
17-12-2020||Ruchika M. Khanna||10 economists write to Tomar, seek repeal of farm laws||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 17As the stand-off between the agitating farmers and the BJP-led central government continued for the third week, top economists from some of the most reputed research institutions in the country, have raised serious concerns about the farm laws, and demanded their repeal.Putting their weight firmly behind the agitating farmers, the economists -- D Narsimha Reddy, Kamal Nayan Kabra, K N Harilal, Ranjit Singh Ghuman, Surinder Kumar, Arun Kumar, Rajinder Chaudhary, R Ramakumar, Vikas Rawal and Himanshu, have said these laws are not in best interests of small and marginal farmers, and demanded their revocation.In a letter to the Agriculture Minister N S Tomar, these 10 economists have said while they believe that improvements and changes are required in the agricultural marketing system for the benefit of millions of small farmers, but the reforms brought by these Acts do not serve that purpose. “They are based on wrong assumptions and claims about why farmers are unable to get remunerative prices, about farmers not having freedom to sell wherever they like under the previously existing laws, and about regulated markets not being in the farmers’ interests,” the economists said.They have come up five reasons on why these three Acts, brought in as a package by the government, are fundamentally harmful in their implications for the small farmers of India. “These undermine the role of the state government in regulating agriculture markets, when more than 20 states have already amended their APMC Acts to allow private mandis, e trading, e NAM etc. Secondly, two different markets -- existing mandis and the private (unregulated) mandis that are proposed under the new laws -- will have two different sets of rules. If collusion and market manipulation are concerns inside the APMC markets, the same collusion and market manipulation are likely to continue in the unregulated market space. Within the regulated APMC markets, there exist mechanisms to address and prevent such market manipulation, whereas in the unregulated ‘trade areas’, the central Act contemplates no such mechanisms,” they have said.They have warned that even before these Acts came, a large percentage of the sale of agricultural commodities happened outside the APMC regulated market yards. However, the APMC market yards still set the benchmark prices through the daily auctions and offered some reliable price signals to the farmers. Without these price signals, the fragmented markets could pave the way for local monopsonies. The experience in Bihar since the removal of its APMC Act in 2006 shows that farmers have less choice of buyers and less bargaining power, resulting in significantly lower prices compared to other states.The 10 economists have also raised the issue of the huge asymmetry between the two parties, small farmers and companies, in the Contract Farming law, which is not addressed to provide adequate protection to the interests of the farmers. Besides, concern about domination by big agri-businesses is also worrisome, they have said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/10-economists-write-to-tomar-seek-repeal-of-farm-laws-185683
17-12-2020||New Delhi||We expect further talks will help in achieving agreement on resolution: India on Ladakh standoff||India on Thursday hoped that further discussions with China will help both sides to achieve an agreement on a mutually acceptable solution for ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a media briefing the two sides continue to maintain communication through diplomatic and military channels and these discussions have helped both sides to enhance understanding of each other’s positions.Asked about reports that at least one member of the Chinese Community Party was recruited by Indian consulate in Shanghai, Srivastava said he was not in a position to independently verify the information.“We have noted the media reports in this regard. We are not in a position to independently verify the data. In certain countries, hiring of local staff requires the approval of local authorities. However, all our missions and posts ensure due security precautions in this regard,” he said.Responding to a media query on the matter, a Chinese embassy spokesperson said the allegation is “groundless”.Srivastava, when asked about the next round of Sino-India military and diplomatic talks on the over seven-month-long border standoff, did not give a direct reply but said India expects that further talks will help in reaching an agreement for complete disengagement of troops in eastern Ladakh.“It is our expectation that the further discussions will help both sides to achieve an agreement on a mutually acceptable solution for ensuring complete disengagement in all friction points along the LAC in the Western sector and full restoration of peace and tranquillity as early as possible,” Srivastava said.Nearly 50,000 Indian Army troops are deployed in a high state of combat readiness in various mountainous locations in eastern Ladakh in sub-zero conditions as multiple rounds of talks between the two sides have not yielded concrete outcome to resolve the standoff.China has also deployed an equal number of troops, according to officials. The standoff between the two sides erupted in early May.The last round of military talks had taken place on November 6 during which both sides broadly discussed disengagement of troops from specific friction points. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-expect-further-talks-will-help-in-achieving-agreement-on-resolution-india-on-ladakh-standoff-185682

17-12-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||Andhra govt says pesticides responsible for Eluru disease||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, December 17 Nearly two weeks after a mystery disease struck the Eluru town of Andhra Pradesh, the official machinery has finally come to the conclusion that pesticide particles could be responsible for the mystery disease. The finding has been supported by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Indian Institute of Chemical Technology and other science institutes that were probing the mystery disease. Earlier too, it was thought to be a chemical, but the suggestion was towards anti-mosquito sprays. Mystery disease in Eluru town in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh has seen over 600 people fainting and showing signs of epileptic fits since the beginning of the month. Even now the state has assumed that the pesticide particles are responsible for the disease, but officials say more research is required to establish how these pesticide particles entered the human body.  In a statement the Andhra Pradesh Government has said, “Experts from AIIMS and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology have opined that particles of pesticides are the reason for Eluru’s mysterious illness. The experts pointed out that a long-term study is required to find out how those particle materials could have entered into the human bodies. The CM has tasked the further study on the case to AIIMS and IICT.” The AIMS in its statement said, “On observation of patients it appears that this situation has arisen due to organochlorine it might have occurred due to pesticides, there is possibility of that entering into the human body due to food cycle.”It may be pointed out that the Organochlorine pesticides are banned because of their being high toxicity and harmful effects to human being, but they continue to be available at some places. The test reports have shown that only limited quantities of metals were found in the ground water and were within range. Only mercury found in ground water was beyond the acceptable range.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-govt-says-pesticides-responsible-for-eluru-disease-185651

The Committee is free to disagree with what I say, but the fact that the Chairman does not even permit a member to speak is a sad comment on how the government handles military affairs."Sir, as Speaker of the Lok Sabha and custodian of the House, I urge you to intervene and ensure that the discussion and presentations held in the defence committee are in consonance with the role and objective of the institution and that the right of elected MP's to speak freely is protected," wrote the Congress leader.He expressed his dismay over the contents of the meeting and the manner in which it was conducted and said it was meant to provide legislative oversight on the policies and decisions of the Defence Ministry, it being the premier interface between the defence forces and elected representatives.Gandhi said the agenda for the discussion at the meet was military uniforms, but taking into account the current military situation he felt this surprising. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-writes-to-ls-speaker-claims-he-was-not-allowed-to-speak-in-parliamentary-panel-meet-185650
17-12-2020||Kolkata||Suvendu Adhikari quits TMC; several leaders rally behind him||A day after quitting as MLA, Suvendu Adhikari on Thursday resigned from the primary membership of the TMC, intensifying speculations that he might switch over to the BJP later this week.According to party sources, several disgruntled leaders are rallying behind him.Adhikari, the face of the Nandigram movement that added to the political heft of Mamata Banerjee and catapulted her to power in Bengal in 2011, sent his resignation letter to West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee during the second half of the day, party sources said.“I am writing to tender my resignation as a member of All India Trinamool Congress as well as from all other positions held by me in the party and its associate organs with immediate effect,” Adhikari wrote.Ending his two-decade-old association with the party, the former TMC heavyweight thanked Banerjee for the opportunities given to him, and said would he would always value the time he spent as its member.Some of Adhikari’s supporters indicated that he was likely to join the BJP on Saturday during a saffron party programme in Midnapore. Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who is scheduled to visit Bengal for two days, starting Saturday, will also attend the programme.Adhikari’s resignation from the TMC puts a lid on all rumour mills that went abuzz speculating his moves since November 26, when he resigned as the chairman of Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC).Shortly after, he quit the state cabinet.On Wednesday, he submitted his resignation as MLA of Nandigram constituency in Purba Medinipur district.Of late, he had criticised the TMC leadership, on several occasions, for its style of functioning. The party made several attempts to woo him back, but none bore fruit.Hinting that a rebellion was brewing in the ruling party ahead of the assembly polls, Adhikari had on Wednesday night held a closed-door meeting with its disgruntled leaders, including Asansol civic body chief Jitendra Tiwari and senior MP Sunil Mandal, in Paschim Bardhaman district.Tiwari, an MLA from Pandebeshwar constituency who recently slammed the state government for allegedly depriving the industrial town of central funds for “political reasons”, resigned as the chairman of the Board of Administrators, Asansol Municipal Corporation, on Thursday afternoon.Senior TMC leader Diptangshu Choudhary, who, too, was present at the meeting, has also tendered his resignation from the post of South Bengal State Transport Corporation chairman.Hailing Adhikari’s decision, BJP national vice president Mukul Roy claimed that “this is the beginning of the end of the ruling party which would now collapse like a house of cards”.He asserted that the saffron party would welcome him with open arms.“The day Suvendu Adhikari resigned from the state cabinet, I had said I would be happy if he leaves the TMC and joins the BJP. Today, he has left the party. We would be happy to welcome him,” Roy said.Adhikari’s father Sisir Adhikari and brother Dibyendu are sitting TMC MPs from Tamluk and Kanthi Lok Sabha constituencies respectively.The family wields considerable influence over at least 40-45 assembly segments in Paschim Medinipur, Bankura, Purulia, Jhargram, parts of Birbhum—mainly in the Junglemahal region—and some areas in minority-dominated Murshidabad district.With Assembly polls slated to held in April-May, the growing dissent within the TMC, if not reined in, might hamper the party’s poll prospects.

17-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government opposes plea seeking removal of Kangana Ranaut's Twitter account||The Maharashtra government told the Bombay High Court on Thursday that a petition which seeks that Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut's Twitter account be permanently suspended was not maintainable.The reliefs sought by petitioner Ali Kaashif Khan Deshmukh were "vague", and the plea should be dismissed, government lawyer Y P Yagnik said.Deshmukh, a city-based lawyer, said in his criminal writ petition that Twitter should be directed to permanently suspend or disable Ranaut's account to stop the "spread of hate in the country".Twitter should be also directed to follow guidelines and laws of the country to prevent the "misuse" of its platform, the petitioner said.He cited several controversial tweets by Ranaut and her sister Rangoli Chandel which allegedly incited hatred against communities and the state machinery.These tweets included the one which led to the suspension of Chandel's account by Twitter India for targeting a community, and also Ranaut's tweet comparing Mumbai to "Pak- occupied- Kashmir".Arguing before a division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik on Thursday, Deshmukh said he had written to the police and Maharashtra authorities in the past seeking action against Ranaut and her sister."She (Ranaut) has multiple FIRs pending against her.In the past she has misused the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput for her own gains and she is doing so now with farmers' protest too," Deshmukh said.But the judges sought to know if the plea was a Public Interest Litigation (PIL).When Deshmukh said it was not, the bench said, "Then how can we act in a criminal case on the basis of claims made by a third party, who is in no way affected personally? Is this a PIL? If not, then you will have to show personal injury to you, how it is affecting you."Government lawyer Yagnik argued that the plea did not state how the tweets flagged by the petitioner affected the public at large."This is a very vague petition. Twitter is an international body. One can not seek vague reliefs like these.This plea is not maintainable and should be disposed of," Yagnik said.Deshmukh argued that Ranaut had been spreading "continuous hatred" in the country.The HC, however, reiterated that in a criminal case, the court could not act at the instance of a third party.It directed Deshmukh to "ponder" whether the issue should be raised through a PIL or the criminal writ petition should continue, and adjourned the matter to December 21. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-government-opposes-plea-seeking-removal-of-kangana-ranauts-twitter-account-185645

The Adults (45-60) and Seniors (60+) are not as ready as the younger age groups. This may be due to concerns about complications post taking it.Vishal Gondal, Founder and CEO, GOQii said, "The World Health Organisation is cautiously optimistic that safe and effective vaccines for Covid-19 will be successfully developed soon. There is a robust pipeline of potential vaccines in the development, and some have already advanced to the next stage. The Government of India has taken several steps from implementing lockdown to announcing a relief package of Rs 1.7 lakh crore to the medical industry for rapid improvement in the testing capacity among many others. There are different types of initiatives which the government, at the Central, state and local level, is working on. We at GOQii commend the efforts that various organisations have put in to help the world see through these difficult times. While the public opinion may vary, the important aspect to note is that preventive healthcare is the only way forward, as boosting immunity and staying healthy is the best and only viable option amidst a dreaded pandemic."According to the study, 50 per cent of the respondents feel that the Central government initiatives have been effective in curbing the spread of Covid-19 while 25 per cent of the people surveyed believe that the state government initiatives have been effective. Only 22 per cent of citizens recognise the efforts of the local Government in terms of effectiveness.Also, 66 per cent of the population surveyed believes the opening up of lockdown slowly is the way forward while 34 per cent feel that a complete lockdown should be introduced again. 25 per cent have a positive opinion about the current partial lockdown and think that it should continue in a similar manner.While 31 per cent want things to return back to normal but only in a gradual way, wherein the rest restriction will be loosened very cautiously and while monitoring the numbers.10 per cent of people who said that there should be no restrictions and things should go back to normal. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/53-indian-unsure-about-taking-covid-vaccine-185642

17-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers’ protest: Among 3 main sites at Delhi borders, Singhu emerges as hotspot||The Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders have come up as the most prominent protest sites for the ongoing farmers’ agitation, but one location — Singhu — seemingly has been receiving more limelight than the others.While there is no dearth of the fighting spirit among demonstrators at Tikri and Ghazipur either, the facilities at these relatively smaller protest sites are limited.Singhu, which has emerged as the centre of the agitation, has had a constant influx of resources both in cash and in kind.Over the days, good Samaritans, gurdwara committees and NGOs have made large donations as well as pooled technological resources to sustain the agitation.For over two weeks now, thousands of farmers, largely from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the new farm laws at these Delhi borders after repeated rounds of talks with the government have ended in stalemate.According to Ranjit Singh, who has been camping at the Singhu border since November 26, the site has been receiving higher traction than the other two because it was the first border to be blocked.“Singhu hit the headlines earlier than Tikri and Ghazipur, which is why all these organisations came here offering help, but they are also offering similar ‘sewa’ at the other borders,” the member of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Krantikari) said.“The facilities also seem more here because there are more people here. That is it. The sentiment to fight for our rights is the same everywhere,” he said.Among the noticeable technology-powered facilities at Singhu are roti-making machines and steam boilers.Installed at multiple ‘langars’, the roti machines and boilers that can make 1000 to 1200 chapatis in an hour and cook 50 kg of rice and dal at a time, respectively, ensure a consistent supply of food throughout the day for one and all.Several farmers at Singhu have themselves installed solar panels on their tractor-trolleys for charging mobile phones and running washing machines to ensure supply of clean clothes to the protestors.While the other sites are not devoid of these facilities, the provisions there are simply fewer in number.Both Tikri and Ghazipur have multiple ‘langars’ offering food supply throughout the day and, like Singhu, mobile charging and medical facilities have been made available at both the sites.Though some claim the difference in availability of facilities is because of the economic disparity between the protesting farmers at different sites, all three venues have farmers from mixed economic backgrounds.There are farmers owning five acres as well as 50 acres of land at all sites.Many protestors said the facilities were more at Singhu simply because it was the focal point of the agitation.Jagtar Singh Bhagiwander, a farmer who is agitating at Tikri, said there was as much of a rush at Tikri as there was at Singhu.“When it comes to new facilities, Singhu has an advantage because it is on the highway and it is more accessible,” he said.“Another important factor is that most of those agitating at Singhu come from a wealthy background which makes all the difference,” said Bhagiwander, a farmer who is agitating at Tikri.Gurunam Singh, who is also protesting at Tikri since the very beginning, said Tikri was receiving as many facilities as Singhu.Whatever little difference there might be is because Singhu is where the “main leadership is centred”.“We too are getting donations here for close to Rs 1 lakh on daily basis but the major chunk goes to Singhu because it is the centre of our agitation. It has nothing to do with the economic divide among farmers. We were not sure if we would reach Delhi borders but since we were allowed by the Haryana side, we then diverted towards Tikri and the main leadership settled at Singhu,” Gurunam said.At Ghazipur, facilities and protestors might be fewer, but no one’s complaining.“If Singhu is getting more facilities, it is because there are more people there, but this is not a competition between protest sites. All of us are here to demand our rights and wherever facilities are being provided, it is helping our movement. We don’t have roti machines here, but there is no lack of food supply. Like farmers in Singhu or Tikri, we are also charging our phones from our tractors,” Alok Solanki, a farmer from Kannauj, said.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at several Delhi borders against the new agri laws for the 22 days.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

17-12-2020||New Delhi||Research suggests disturbance from North Atlantic could be reason why monsoon derails in August||A planetary wave from the North Atlantic is capable of derailing the Indian monsoon in August, a study by the Indian Institute of Sciences (IISc), Bengaluru, has suggested.A team from the Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences (CAOS) of the IISc carried out the research, supported in part by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) under their climate change programme.The research showed that in the past century, Indian monsoon droughts that occurred in non-El Niño years were sub-seasonal as against El Niño droughts where the deficit persists throughout the season.The research team analysed the daily rainfall during the two categories of droughts from 1900 to 2015 and noticed dramatic differences in the evolution of rainfall deficit.Rainfall deficit in El Niño droughts sets in early around mid-June and becomes progressively worse. By mid-August, the deficit is very high and spreads across the country, with no sign of recovery, the study revealed.During non-El Niño droughts there is a moderate decrease in June rainfall, followed by signs of recovery during mid-July to mid-August. The peak of the season.However, in late August, there is an abrupt and steep fall in rainfall, resulting in drought conditions."We tried to trace this late August break to a forcing agent or system that influences the behaviour over India. We looked at the winds that were prevalent in these non-El Niño drought years," a statement issued by the IISc quoted Jai Sukhatme, associate professor at CAOS and one of the senior authors, as saying.The interaction between upper-level winds and deep cyclonic vorticity anomalies located above anomalously cold North Atlantic waters during late August to early September results in an atmospheric disturbance, explained V Venugopal, associate professor at CAOS and a co-author."This disturbance, a Rossby wave, curves in towards India and, apparently squeezed in by the Tibetan Plateau, disrupts the flow of the monsoon winds," he said.Oceanic and atmospheric Rossby waves—also known as planetary waves—naturally occur largely due to the Earth's rotation.These waves affect the planet's weather and climate."The atmospheric tele-connection studied in this paper, whose first author was a PhD student Pritam Borah with DST INSPIRE Fellowship, offers an avenue for improved predictability of droughts, especially in the absence of telltale signs in the Pacific," the statement said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/research-suggests-disturbance-from-north-atlantic-could-be-reason-why-monsoon-derails-in-august-185627
17-12-2020||New Delhi||HC’s can’t order to speed up trial on application by person not connected with case: SC||A High Court cannot order a lower court to expedite trial on an application by a person who is not connected with the criminal proceeding, the Supreme Court has said on Thursday.The top court said it was well settled that criminal trial, where offences involved are under the Prevention of Corruption Act, have to be conducted and concluded at the earliest as they affected not only the accused but the entire society and administration.A three-judge bench comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan, RS Reddy and MR Shah said the High Court in appropriate cases could very well under Section 482 of the CrPC (inherent powers of high court) or in any other proceeding could always direct trial court to expedite the criminal trial and issue such order as may be necessary.“An application by a person who is in no way connected with the criminal proceeding or criminal trial under Section 482 CrPC cannot ordinarily be entertained by the High Court. A criminal trial of an accused is conducted in accordance with procedure as prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Code. It is the obligation of the State and the prosecution to ensure that all criminal trials are conducted expeditiously so that justice can be delivered to the accused, if found guilty,” the bench said.The observation came on an appeal against a judgement of the Allahabad High Court, which directed the trial court to expedite the criminal trial and conclude the same at the earliest.The Uttar Pradesh police had lodged a case against one Sanjay Tiwari in 2006 and filed a charge sheet after 14 years.The HC had ordered the lower court to speed up the trial on the plea of social activist Tripuresh Tripathi.The Apex Court said this was not a case where prosecution or even the employer of the accused have filed an application either before the trial court or in any other court.The Apex Court said it had held in earlier judgments that it is for parties in the criminal case to raise questions and challenge the proceedings initiated against them at appropriate time before the proper forum and not for third parties under the garb of public interest litigants.The top court said in a criminal case, an outsider could not have any legal role.“But the present is a case where proceedings initiated by Tripathi do not appear to be bona fide proceedings. He is in no way connected with initiation of criminal proceedings against the appellant,” it said.

17-12-2020||New Delhi||Govt willing to sit with farmers to sort out issues: Puri||The government is willing to sit with the farmers protesting against the Centre's new farm laws and sort out the issues, Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Thursday.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and elsewhere have been protesting at various border points of Delhi, including Singhu and Tikri, for over a fortnight, demanding that the Centre repeal the three new farm laws."It pains me that many people who are sitting in protest probably are not aware of what they are protesting against... Government is still sending a message to all the farmers that please come and talk," Puri said at an online function of industry chamber HDCCI.There were three demands—MSP (minimum support price) should not be taken away, mandis should stay and nobody should in a clandestine manner usurp the farmers' land—and all these have been granted, he added."There has been a big misunderstanding... we are willing to sit with anyone and sort this out," Puri added.The minister, who also holds the civil aviation portfolio, expressed confidence that by the end of December and the first quarter of 2021 (January-March) "we will be back to pre-COVID levels".He said that all the normal civil aviation operations were closed when India went in for a lockdown in March and reopened on May 25, with just 30,000 passengers a day."A few days ago, we had more than 2,53,000 passengers... I am confident that by the end of December and the first quarter of 2021 (January-March 2021), we will be back to pre-COVID levels," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-willing-to-sit-with-farmers-to-sort-out-issues-puri-185614

17-12-2020||New Delhi||At this stage, farmers’ protest should be allowed to continue: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to interfere with the ongoing agitation against farm laws by farmers from Punjab and some other states who have blocked certain entry points to the national capital for weeks, saying it was their fundamental right.“We are of the view at this stage that the farmers’ protest should be allowed to continue without impediment and without any breach of peace either by the protesters or the police,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said during hearing on petitions seeking removal of agitating farmers from Delhi roads.“We clarify that this court will not interfere with the protest in question. Indeed the right to protest is part of a fundamental right and can as a matter of fact, be exercised subject to public order,” it said.“There can certainly be no impediment in the exercise of such rights as long as it is non-violent and does not result in damage to the life and properties of other citizens and is in accordance with law,” the Bench noted.Harish Salve, who represented one of the petitioners, argued that “no right is absolute, not even right to free speech...We have to look at contouring of the right and not curtailment of right...One can’t hold a city to ransom and say either government listens to us or will stop the country”.Salve wanted the court to direct the police to ensure normal life in Delhi was not affected by the blockade. However, the Bench turned it down, saying, it can’t pass such an order without hearing the farmers’ organisations.To end the stalemate between protesting farmers and the government, the Bench decided to constitute a committee of independent and impartial persons including agriculture experts.However, it said, “This may not be possible without hearing all the necessary parties. Till the parties come before us, it would be advisable to obtain suggestions about the constitution of the said committee from all the parties which may be submitted by them on the date of next hearing in the matter.”While posting the matter for hearing after the winter vacation, the Bench gave liberty to the parties to move the vacation Bench, if necessary. It also posted petitions challenging the validity of the farm laws after the winter break.However, it said, “The pendency of these matters will not prevent the parties from resolving the issue amicably.”The top court sought to know from the Centre if it was ready to defer implementation of the farm laws that have led to protests by farmers who have blocked certain entry points to the national capital since November 26.“Can the union say no executive action will be taken under the laws in order to facilitate negotiations,” it asked the Attorney General KK Venugopal.The Attorney General said he would seek instructions even as Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said, “It will be tough.”On behalf of the Punjab Government, senior advocate P Chidambaram said the farmers wanted to march to Delhi but they were stopped.“The farmers didn’t block any road. The police did it,”he submitted.“We want Parliament to convene and the parliamentarians to discuss the issue,” Chidambaram said.He, however, said, “The State has no objection to the court’s suggestion that a group of people can facilitate a dialogue between farmers and the Central government.”Venugopal expressed concern over violation of COVID-19 guidelines, saying it could lead to spread of the pandemic in villages once the protesting farmers go back.“None of them wear a face mask, they sit together in large numbers. COVID-19 is a concern, they will visit villages and spread it there. They can’t violate fundamental rights of others,” the AG said.Venugopal said, “Their demand is to repeal the three laws…They must be directed to come for discussion. They cannot say either repeal or will continue indefinitely.”He said the damage caused by 22 days of blockade was enormous. “People are not able to go for jobs. Ambulances are not permitted to move. This kind of blockade cannot be permitted,” the AG said.Terming it a “matter of national importance”, a Bench had on Wednesday issued notice to the Centre on the petition and said such issues needed to be resolved through negotiations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-this-stage-farmers-protest-should-be-allowed-to-continue-sc-185603
17-12-2020||New Delhi||SC refuses to interfere with HC order quashing detention of Kafeel Khan under NSA||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to interfere with the Allahabad High Court verdict which had quashed the detention of Dr Kafeel Khan under the National Security Act (NSA) and ordered his immediate release.A Bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, which was hearing the Uttar Pradesh government's plea challenging the high court's September 1 verdict, said it is “a good judgement”. “We will not interfere in the judgement. However, the observation will not impact any other proceedings,” said the bench, also comprising justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state, told the Bench that observation made by the high court exonerates Khan in the criminal proceedings. “Criminal cases will be decided on their own merits,” the Bench observed.Khan had hit the headlines after the 2017 tragedy at Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College, in which several children died due to a lack of oxygen cylinders. Initially, he was hailed as a saviour for arranging emergency oxygen cylinders but later faced action along with nine other doctors and staff members of the hospital, all of whom were released on bail later.In its September 1 verdict, the high court had quashed khan's detention under the NSA and ordered his immediate release, saying his speech at the AMU didn't promote hatred or violence and gave a call for national integrity.The high court had said that the Aligarh district magistrate, who had passed the order for Khan's detention, did a "selective reading" of his speech, "ignoring its true intent".The high court had allowed the petition filed by Khan's mother, Nuzhat Parveen, and said the detention order by the district magistrate was illegal.

17-12-2020||Dhaka||India is our true friend: Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina||Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday said that India is Bangladesh’s true friend as she expressed her gratitude to the country and the Indian Army for their support during the 1971 liberation war.Addressing a virtual summit with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, Hasina said she was happy to meet him again, “particularly on this month of victory”.“December evokes in all Bangladeshis the spirit of joy, freedom and celebration as we recall with deep gratitude our ‘Father of the Nation’ Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman under whose dynamic leadership we earned our great independence,” she said.“India is our true friend,” the Bangladesh Prime Minister said.“I pay deep homage to the three million martyrs who laid down their lives. I pay tribute to the members of the Indian armed forces martyred in the war and to their families. I pay my gratitude to the government and the people of India who extended their wholehearted support for the cause of our nation,” she said.The war in 1971 broke after the sudden crackdown at midnight past on March 25, 1971, in erstwhile East Pakistan by the Pakistani troops and ended on December 16. The same year Pakistan conceded defeat and unconditionally surrendered in Dhaka to the allied forces comprising the freedom fighters and the Indian soldiers.Officially, three million people were killed during the nine-month-long war.Modi and Hasina jointly inaugurated a digital exhibition on Mujibur Rahman and Mahatma Gandhi in an effort to celebrate the life and legacies of the iconic leaders.Hasina and Modi also relaunched a trans-border rail route between Chilahati and West Bengal’s Haldibari which has been inoperative for almost 55 years.The ties between India and Bangladesh have witnessed a significant upswing in the last few years. Both sides have scaled up trade and economic engagement besides implementing a number of connectivity and infrastructure projects.

17-12-2020||Washington||US has stood with India as it faced Chinese aggression: White House official||Expressing concern over China's increasing aggression across the globe from Hong Kong, Taiwan, South China Sea and along the India-China border, a senior White House official said the US has stood with New Delhi during its military standoff with Beijing.Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official asserted that US President Donald Trump, during his presidency, has really strengthened all aspects of the US-India security and defence cooperation to build a comprehensive, enduring and mutually beneficial defence partnership.“We have been very concerned with China's increasing aggression really across the globe, whether it be Hong Kong, Taiwan, South China Sea and of course along the India-China border,” the senior administration official from the White House told PTI in an exclusive interview.“We have stood with India as it faced this aggression along its border over the last six-seven months. We provided equipment. We have been engaged with India, shown our moral support for India to be able to stand up to the Chinese and make sure that there are a peaceful resolution and de-escalation of the situation,” said the official.The armies of India and China are locked in a tense border standoff in eastern Ladakh since early May. Both sides have held multiple rounds of military and diplomatic talks. However, no breakthrough has been achieved yet.During the Trump administration, the United States has become the second-largest arms supplier to India, growing from virtually no sales a decade ago to more than USD 20 billion today, the official said.Earlier this year, the US and India concluded USD 3 billion in defence sales for naval and attack helicopters. To bolster India's role as a net provider of security in the Indo-Pacific, the Trump administration has lifted restrictions on the provision of sensitive defence technology, enabling India to become the first country that's not a treaty ally of the United States to be offered armed MQ-9 Reaper drones.In support of India during its border standoff with China, the United States has leased two MQ-9s to India while the sale of MQ-9s is being finalised, said the official.The US also expedited delivery of cold weather gear to support the deployment of Indian military along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) through the winter, said the senior administration official.“In addition, we have concluded the basic exchange and cooperation agreement, which is the last of the so-called key defence enabling agreements. I think this is really a historic achievement that clearly demonstrates progress in defence partnership,” said the official.Responding to a question, the senior administration official said that the US cut security aid and reimbursements to Pakistan in January 2018. There have been some exceptions, such as for things that are in the US interest.“Some minor exceptions. But the suspension remains in effect. We continue to look to Pakistan to crack down on terrorists and militants on its territory. We've seen some progress on that front. But we certainly need to see more. We need to see a decisive crackdown, and sustained measures to rein in these terrorists and militant groups,” said the official.“We have received cooperation from Pakistan on the Afghan peace process. We value the cooperation that we have received from Pakistan. We continue to work with Pakistan and look to them to help when it comes to convincing the Taliban to reduce violence, for example.“We were glad to see that the two sides are sitting down in Doha, and have been for the last several months, but we are very troubled by the high levels of Taliban violence that continues. So, we do look to Pakistan to help us move the peace process forward. And right now, that means to see a reduction in violence from the Taliban,” the senior administration official added.His remarks came as a high-level delegation of the Afghan Taliban, led by Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, met Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in Islamabad on Wednesday and discussed the Afghan peace process, amid growing incidents of violence in the war-torn country.The delegation is visiting Pakistan at a time when President Trump has ordered the withdrawal of more American soldiers from Afghanistan, leaving around 2,500 troops behind in the strife-torn country.

17-12-2020||Mumbai||Parliament session cancelled to evade discussion on key issues: Shiv Sena||Criticising the Centre’s decision not to hold the winter session of Parliament, the Shiv Sena on Thursday claimed the Union Government wants to evade discussion on issues like the ongoing farmers’ protest, country’s economic situation and border standoff with China.An editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said the session had been cancelled so that the Opposition did not get an opportunity to ask questions on these issues.“What democratic practice is this? The country will remain alive only if voices from the opposition benches are strong in a democracy. The democratic traditions in Parliament inspire the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi must follow these traditions,” it said.The Central Government recently conveyed to the Opposition that the winter session of Parliament will not be held this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the budget session will be convened in January 2021.“The COVID-19 did not stop the election of a big democratic country in the world. But we are not allowing (even) four-day winter session of Parliament.“The US held polls and changed the guard in a democratic manner. This is the democracy of the superpower; (while) we locked the supreme temple of democracy,” the editorial said.Referring to the Maharashtra BJP unit’s criticism of the state government over holding a curtailed, two-day, winter session of the Legislature due to COVID-19, it said the BJP’s views on democracy change “as per its convenience”.The Marathi publication said Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi had talked about having spoken to all parties on not holding the winter session.When and where the discussion was held? it asked.“Prime Minister Modi and his colleagues inspire people to fight COVID-19 but are leaving the ground when it comes to themselves?” it alleged.Citing COVID-19 to cancel Parliament session is a “sham” as Modi himself addressed campaign rallies during the recent Bihar Assembly polls, the editorial said.It also referred to BJP president JP Nadda’s visits to West Bengal, which goes to polls next year.“People in the BJP took to streets several times seeking reopening of temples (in Maharashtra) but for them to think about not opening the supreme temple of democracy must be said is a kind of pretension,” the Shiv Sena alleged.All other people were going to work but those running the country have “locked” Parliament fearing COVID-19, it said.“Why this rule is limited only to Parliament session? (We) should get an answer about whether jawans deployed on the border, too, should return home due to COVID-19,” it said.The editorial asked why a new Parliament building is being constructed if the Lok Sabha is to be “locked” due to COVID-19.“Rs 900 crore will be spent on constructing the new Sansad Bhavan, is it for locking from outside?” it asked.

17-12-2020||---||SC order on contempt plea against Kunal Kamra, Rachita Taneja on Friday||New Delhi, December 17The Supreme Court will on Friday pronounce its order on petitions seeking initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against stand-up comic artist Kunal Kamra and comic artist Rachita Taneja for allegedly scandalising the judiciary.After initial hearing on the petitions, a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said it would pass appropriate orders on December 18.It heard advocate Nishant R Katneshwarkar, who appeared for one of the petitioners and claimed that Kamra had posted several tweets scandalous to the judiciary."All these tweets are scandalous and we had sought consent from the Attorney General," Katneshwarkar told the Bench.Attorney General KK Venugopal has already given his consent to initiate criminal contempt of court proceedings against both Kamra and Taneja for insinuating the Supreme Court after it gave bail to Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami in an abetment to suicide case.Terming Kamra's tweets as "highly objectionable", Venugopal had said in his opinion it "constitutes criminal contempt of court".The tweets are not only in bad taste but clearly cross the line between humour and contempt of court, the Attorney General had noted.In one of his tweets, Kamra showed the Supreme Court in saffron colour with a BJP flag in place of the Tricolour. He tweeted that honour had left the building (Supreme Court) long back and it was "the most supreme joke of the country". He also made nasty comments about a sitting Supreme Court judge.Taneja had circulated a caricature that allegedly depicted a quid pro quo relationship between the judiciary and the government with regard to the Ayodhya verdict. She had also allegedly insinuated the top court for giving bail to TV journalist Arnab Goswami.The consent of either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General is necessary, under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, for initiating contempt proceedings against a person in the Supreme Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-order-on-contempt-plea-against-kunal-kamra-rachita-taneja-on-friday-185592
17-12-2020||New Delhi||India, Bangladesh ink 7 pacts; restore cross-border rail link||In a reflection of their rapidly growing ties, India and Bangladesh on Thursday sealed seven agreements to further broadbase cooperation in a plethora of sectors, and restored a cross-border rail link snapped by the 1965 war with Pakistan.The restoration of the Chilahati-Haldibari railway link and signing of the pacts, providing for cooperation in areas of hydrocarbons, agriculture and textiles among others, came at a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina.In his opening remarks, Modi said the holding of the virtual summit immediately after celebration of the Vijay Diwas (Victory Day) assumed "special significance" and noted that Bangladesh is a key pillar of India's 'Neighbourhood First' policy.On Wednesday, India began the 50th anniversary year celebrations of its victory over Pakistan in the 1971 war that led to the birth of Bangladesh.Bangladesh celebrates December 16 as 'Bijoy Dibosh' (Victory Day)."It is a matter of pride for us to celebrate the historic victory of Bangladesh over the anti-liberation forces. Today, when Bangladesh is celebrating 49 years of independence, I pay homage to the armed forces personnel of both the countries who laid down their lives," Modi said.The two prime ministers also jointly inaugurated a digital exhibition on Bangladesh's founder Mujibur Rahman and Mahatma Gandhi in an effort to celebrate the life and legacies of the two iconic leaders.The inauguration of the Chilahati-Haldibari rail link is expected to enhance connectivity to Assam and West Bengal from Bangladesh. It was part of the broad gauge main route from Kolkata to Siliguri till 1965.However, the war of 1965 effectively cut off all the railway links. Both sides have already restored four other rail links that were suspended in 1965. Initially, the Chilahati-Haldibari rail link will facilitate the movement of goods and cargo. Passenger movement will also commence after the development of required infrastructure on both sides.In his comments, Modi said strengthening and deepening India's relations with Bangladesh has been a special priority for him since he took office, adding cooperation between the two countries has been "good" notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic."It has been a challenging year due to the epidemic. But it is a matter of satisfaction that India and Bangladesh had good cooperation in this difficult time," the prime minister said."We are also having good cooperation in the field of vaccine.

Forget double income, the farmers had been struggling on the roads to retain whatever meagre income they currently had, he alleged.The cricketer-turned-politician also alleged the corporates whom the NDA government was trying to align with the farmers through contract farming had set bad precedents of "fleecing".He cited how the corporates allegedly harmed the economic interests of their rivals with "government patronage".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/manmohan-only-pm-who-waived-loans-of-farmers-says-navjot-sidhu-in-video-he-posts-185586

17-12-2020||United Nations||UN agency names Indian entrepreneur among 'Young Champions of the Earth'||A 29-year-old Indian entrepreneur is among the seven winners of the prestigious ‘Young Champions of the Earth’ 2020 prize given by the UN environment agency to global change-makers using innovative ideas and ambitious action to help solve some of the world's most pressing environmental challenges.Vidyut Mohan, an engineer, is the co-founder of ‘Takachar’, a social enterprise enabling farmers to prevent open burning of their waste farm residues and earn extra income by converting them into value-added chemicals like activated carbon on-site, UN Environment Programme (UNEP) said in a statement on Tuesday.“I've always been passionate about energy access and creating income opportunities for poor communities,” Mohan was quoted as saying in the statement.       “(That) is at the heart of finding answers to the difficult question of balancing economic growth and climate change mitigation in developing countries,” he said.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a message that in the middle of a global pandemic, with societies struggling, economies stretched to their limits and an escalating biodiversity and climate crisis, “we need to act boldly and urgently to repair our relationship with nature and take the path of sustainable development”.He said that the Young Champions of the Earth “inspire and mobilise”.UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen said globally, young people are leading the way in calling for meaningful and immediate solutions to the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.“We must listen. As we enter this decisive decade where we work to cut emissions and protect and restore ecosystems, UNEP Young Champions demonstrate that all of us can contribute, starting where we are with what we have. Every single act for nature counts, and we need the entire spectrum of humanity to share this global responsibility and this profound opportunity,” Andersen said.Takachar buys rice husks, straw and coconut shells from farmers and turns them into charcoal, saving the debris from the fires, which are also a driver of climate change. Since Takachar was launched in 2018, Mohan and its co-founder Kevin Kung have worked with about 4,500 farmers and processed 3,000 tonnes of crops, UNEP said.Mark Radka, chief of the energy and climate branch at UNEP's Economy Division, said the open burning of agricultural residues is a big source of air pollution in many parts of the world and “Takachar's innovative technology can help farmers turn what is currently thought of as waste into a valuable resource while helping clean up our environment.” “Slowly and gradually all funding streams available and support services are turning towards sustainability. Companies are going to lose if they don't become sustainable in the long run,” Mohan, a 2019 Echoing Green Fellow and a 2020 Forbes 30 Under 30 awardee, said.By deploying small-scale, low-cost portable biomass upgrading equipment, Takachar enables rural farmers to earn 40 per cent more by converting their crop residues into fuels, fertilisers and value-added chemicals like activated carbon (AC) on-site.By choosing activated carbon (AC) as the starting market, Takachar brings this value chain to the doorstep of farmers and hence reduces air pollution associated with crop residue burning, while ensuring a stable, renewable, pollution free and financially lucrative raw material supply for the AC industry vs Traditional fossil-based sources.By 2030, Takachar will impact 300 million farmers affected by this problem, create USD 4 billion/year equivalent in additional rural income and jobs, and mitigate one gigaton/year of CO2 equivalent, UNEP added.This year's Young Champions were selected by a global jury of experts following a competitive public nomination. Each will receive USD 10,000 in seed funding and tailored training to help scale up their ideas. The Young Champions of the Earth prize is awarded every year to seven entrepreneurs under the age of 30 with bold ideas for sustainable environmental change.The other awardees are 29-year-old Nzambi Matee from Kenya, a materials engineer and head of Gjenge Makers, which produces sustainable low-cost construction materials made of recycled plastic waste and sand; 29-year old Xiaoyuan Ren from China who leads MyH2O, a data platform that tests and records the quality of groundwater across a thousand villages in rural China into an app so residents know where to find clean water.Lefteris Arapakis, 26, from Greece founded the start-up Enaleia, through which the team trains, empowers and incentivises the local fishing community to collect plastic from the sea, allowing both fish stocks and the ecosystem to recover; 30-year old Max Hidalgo Quinto from Peru founded Yawa, building portable wind turbines that harvest up to 300 litres of water per day from atmospheric humidity and mist.Niria Alicia Garcia, 28, from the US coordinates - alongside a community of indigenous activists - the annual Run 4 Salmon event using virtual reality to bring to life the historical journey of the Sacramento chinook salmon along California's largest watershed, raising awareness of this invaluable ecosystem, the species and people it supports; 24-year old Fatemah Alzelzela from Kuwait started Eco Star, a non-profit recycling initiative that exchanges trees and plants for waste from homes, schools and businesses in Kuwait.

He is now staying at a shelter home and is being counselled.Some families have approached us and are keen to adopt the child. We can give him to such a family under the policy of the government, called foster care, but first, we have to trace his family." The child, who is around nine years old, is being counselled by the Child Welfare Committee, and the administration is making all efforts to bring him into the mainstream.The police department is planning to admit him into the Modern Police School, as private institutions are reluctant to give admission to the boy who has never been to school.Muzaffarnagar Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Abhishek Yadav, has asked SHO Anil Kaparwan to admit the boy into the Modern Police School, if no one comes to help him.The boy, Ankit, does not remember where he belongs to, except the fact that his father is in jail, and that his mother has abandoned him. He has been surviving by working at tea stalls and on selling balloons.He sleeps on the footpath with his friend -- Danny, a dog, who stays with him always. He uses his earnings to feed himself and his pet dog.Ankit made news when someone clicked his photograph, sleeping on a pavement with his dog and sharing a blanket with the pet.After the photograph went viral on social media, Muzaffarnagar SSP tracked down the boy and took him under his care.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-story-of-up-homeless-boy-his-dog-goes-viral-offers-to-adopt-them-pour-in-185573
17-12-2020||Ayodhya||Foundation stone for Ayodhya mosque to be laid on Republic Day||The blueprint of the mosque to replace the Babri Masjid will be unveiled this Saturday and its foundation laid on Republic Day on the five-acre land allotted for it here, members of the Trust formed for its construction said.“The Trust chose January 26, 2021 for laying the foundation stone of the Ayodhya mosque as on this day our Constitution came into effect over seven decades ago. Our Constitution is based on pluralism, which is the leitmotif of our mosque project,” said Athar Hussain, secretary of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF).The IICF was set up by the Sunni Waqf Board six months ago to build the mosque.The blueprint of the mosque complex, which will include a multi-speciality hospital, a community kitchen and a library, will be unveiled by the IICF on December 19 as the plan for the project has been finalised by its chief architect, Professor SM Akhtar.“The mosque will have a capacity to hold 2,000 namazis at a time and the structure will be round-shaped,” Akhtar told PTI.The Supreme Court on November 9 last year had paved the way for the construction of a Ram Temple at the disputed Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid site at Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the town in Uttar Pradesh.The state government allotted a five-acre land in Dhannipur village in Sohaval Tehsil of Ayodhya.“The new mosque will be bigger than Babri Masjid but won’t be a lookalike of the structure. The hospital will take centre stage in the complex. It will serve humanity in the true spirit of Islam as taught by the Prophet in his last sermon 1,400 years ago,” Akhtar said.“The hospital won’t be a usual concrete structure but will be in sync with the architecture of the mosque, replete with calligraphy and Islamic symbols. It will house a 300-bed speciality unit, where doctors will work with missionary zeal to provide free treatment to the ailing,” he said, adding that “the mosque will be self-efficient for power as it is designed based on solar energy and a natural temperature maintenance system”.“When we talk about the hospital project at Dhannipur, one thing is sure that it will be a multi-speciality hospital,” Hussain said. The community kitchen will serve good quality meals twice a day to cater to the needs of nourishment of the poor people living nearby, he added.“We can establish a nursing and paramedic college to provide human resources to the hospital. We can manage doctors from local resources from Faizabad, and for specialised needs in terms of critical surgeries, we have a group of doctor friends in prominent government and private institutions who want to offer their services,” he said.“We are looking forward to corporate funding for the hospital. There are many donors who are willing to contribute when we have 80 G approval. After that, we will go for FCRA and seek foreign funds from Muslims of Indian origin,” the IICF secretary added.The Babri Masjid was demolished in December 1992 by “kar sevaks” who claimed that the mosque in Ayodhya was built on the site of an ancient Ram temple.

The survey was done by Ipsos MORI, a research firm.Most risk professionals — 91 per cent of those surveyed — said infectious disease (Covid-19, malaria, dengue, Ebola and Zika) will cause a decrease in employee productivity in the next year.One in three respondents anticipated mental health to contribute to decline in productivity. This rises to 43 per cent among risk professionals, who work with students and faculty.“Workforce resilience experts, however, predict that mental health will overtake Covid-19 next year as the top contributor to productivity fall,” findings state listing the following top five risks for the global workforce in 2021 – eco-political turbulence causing civil unrest and crimes; pandemic-borne crisis management; growing infodemic; mental health and risk blind spots due to singular focus on Covid.Half of the risk professionals interviewed online believed health and security risks faced by the workforce would increase further in 2021, a concern most acutely felt in Asia.Risk Outlook 2021 also cites operational challenges for organisations through the next year with over half (54 per cent) of the risk professionals mentioning need for adequate resources to deal with Covid-19 as the top organisational challenge followed by the need for access to accurate health information.“Just as the 9/11 attacks redefined employer duty of care responsibilities of companies from a security point of view, so will Covid-19 for the health agenda,” the survey concludes.Cites operational challenges||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mental-health-top-productivity-disruptor-survey-185314

Representatives of farmers at a meeting with the Centre had on December 9 turned down the proposal but the government maintained that it had not received anything in writing.Krantikari Kisan Union’s Darshan Pal, in a letter to the Union Government on Wednesday, also sought that parallel talks with other farm bodies be stopped and the government must not “discredit” the stir.

The move would have no retrospective impact, Prasad said.“The methodology to designate trusted products will be devised by the designated authority -- the National Cyber Security Coordinator. A list of trusted sources and products would be decided by a committee headed by the deputy national security adviser,” he said.The committee would be called the national security committee on telecom, Prasad said, adding that it would also create a list of designated sources from whom “no procurement can be done”.The directive had provision to qualify telecom gear made by domestic players, the minister said, adding that those who meet the criteria of the preferential market access scheme would be certified as India trusted sources.Spectrum auction in MarchRs 3,500-cr sugar export subsidyThe Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved Rs3,500-crore sugar export subsidy for 60 lakh tonnes during 2020-21.

Political leadership should provide heated tents, better equipment and logistics to the soldiers who are braving this winter at the border and facing the Chinese in Ladakh,” Gandhi said in the presence of Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat.BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP from Haryana Lt Gen (retd) DP Vats countered Gandhi over “the presentation being a waste of time”. “It becomes very embarrassing sometimes when a Lieutenant General is addressed as a Lieutenant,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-walks-out-of-defence-panel-meet-185325

Are you asking us to abolish personal laws?” asked the CJI at the very outset.“In Shayara Bano (triple talaq case) you did it. Under Article 142 you had said directions given will exist till law was brought in. You have intervened in the past, Lordships,” Anand pointed out.As the CJI said the prayer regarding asking the Law Commission to examine it can be considered, Arora said, “For two years we have no one heading the Law Commission. We want a similar relief. If we look at certain provisions of Muslim law, then maintenance can go on only for the period of Biddat. Women are left with nothing.”“When religious customs violate fundamental right to equality and non-discrimination, the court must step in to protect women’s rights,” she submitted.The Bench said, “We are issuing notice with great caution.” The issue is likely to trigger a fresh debate on uniform civil code, a BJP poll promise.Upadhyay’s first PIL sought a direction to the government to take apposite steps to remove anomalies in the grounds of divorce and make them uniform for all citizens without prejudice on the basis of religion, race, cast, sex or place of birth.He demanded the top court should declare that the discriminatory grounds of divorce violated citizens’ right to equality, right to non-discrimination and right to live with human dignity and go on to frame guidelines for “uniform grounds of divorce” for all citizens.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-centre-on-pils-for-uniform-divorce-rules-alimony-185310
17-12-2020||Kolkata||LAC: No intrusions in Eastern Command, says Lt Gen Chauhan||Eastern Army Commander Lt Gen Anil Chauhan on Wednesday said there had been no intrusions or major face-offs in the area of responsibility of the Eastern Command since the Ladakh standoff between Indian troops and China’s PLA.He said post the Galwan valley incident, bonhomie and mutual trust on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China evaporated and it would take time for things to stabilise and rebuild.“There have been no intrusions or major face-offs in the area of responsibility of Eastern Command since the friction erupted in Ladakh,” he said.Lt Gen Chauhan, General-Officer-Commanding, Eastern Command, said the Indian Army and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China had undertaken some precautionary deployment during the Ladakh crisis, which is now witnessing a gradual de-induction in the eastern sector, due to the onset of winter.“However, the Indian Army is fully prepared to beat any challenge during winter,” he said at the Fort William here on the occasion of Vijay Diwas.He said the PLA carried out rapid infrastructure development activities of roads and tracks, and of defences along the Sikkim border and in Kameng in Arunachal Pradesh.“We are taking reciprocal actions and prepared to meet emerging challenges... They have tried to develop some kind of model villages next to the border areas, where they are looking to settle nomadic Tibetan population,” Lt Gen Chauhan said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-no-intrusions-in-eastern-command-says-lt-gen-chauhan-185311
