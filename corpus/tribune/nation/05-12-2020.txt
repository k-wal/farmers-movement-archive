Formation of MVA is a result of our strong belief in democratic values,” she added.The Sena, NCP and Congress are partners in the Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government. They had joined hands after the Assembly elections held last year.In an interview given to a Marathi daily, Pawar had reportedly said Rahul Gandhi appeared to lack consistency.“There are some questions here....There seems to be less consistency,” he had said.

Zafar Islam, who has now become a Rajya Sabha member and had played a key role in Jyotiraditya Scindia joining the BJP, was also at a meeting which lasted for an hour,” Gehlot claimed.“This is how the entire game was played. Randeep Surjewala, Ajay Maken, Avinash Paden, Venugopal, all came and sat here and took decisions to terminate our people and leaders. Only after this, the government could be saved. BJP is doing this conspiracy everywhere. People now say that Maharashtra is the next target... Do not know what will happen. They are going to restart the same in Rajasthan again, this is their thought,” he claimed.Reacting to Gehlot’s claims, BJP state president Satish Poonia said, “It is regrettable, unfortunate, that despite being the chief minister of the state, without having any proof, he took name of Home Minister of India Amit Shah and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, which is beyond political dignity.”            He went on to add, “Today the statement of the chief minister of Rajasthan is clear that this government has failed to rule for two years and a mental deviation is seen in the statements of Ashok Gehlot. I think Gehlot has lost his morale and moral courage.”               In July, a feud between the chief minister and Pilot came out in the open after the latter along with 18 other MLAs revolted against Gehlot’s leadership which led to a political crisis for nearly a month.Pilot, then the deputy chief minister, and two ministers in his camp were dropped from the Gehlot cabinet on July 14.During the crisis, the MLAs of Gehlot camp were lodged in a hotel here and later shifted to Jaisalmer. It came to an end when Pilot and other MLAs met Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi and a committee of three members was set up by the AICC to look into their grievances.

05-12-2020||New Delhi||‘Seeing our plight, our children no longer want to become farmers’||As thousands of farmers dig their heels in at Delhi’s borders bracing chilly winter winds and preparing for a long fight to press for their demands, some rue that seeing their plight, their children no longer wish to get into agriculture.Hasseb Ahmed, who has been on a sit-in against the Centre’s new farm laws here at the Ghazipur border since last Saturday, says he has two school going children, who are busy with their online classes back in his village in Rampur district of Uttar Pradesh, want a better standard of living.His elder son is in Class 12, while the younger is in class 9. “Neither of them wished to get into farming. They have their ambitions and want to land a good job. They say they don’t want to be farmers,” Ahmed said.“With the price that we are offered for our crops, all we can afford to give them is food and basic education. Nothing beyond that. They get disappointed to see that despite all the handwork that goes in it, we don’t receive appropriate returns,” he added.Another farmer, Sita Arya, who is from Amroha district in Uttar Pradesh, said her children too were slowly trying to detach themselves from farming. “They are even ready to sit in a bidi, tabocco or a paan shop to earn a living.”                “We work day and night on the fields but don’t get the required profit. Getting into farming is like falling into a pit. Unless there is profit, our children don’t wish to get into it. If only the government had focused on turning farming into an employment opportunity and set a standard price for our crops, our children would not have been so against this profession, which is in every sense the backbone of this country,” she added.Agitating farmers have stressed that unless their demands are met and the new farm laws repelled, they will not move anywhere from the borders of the national capital and their protest will continue.Daryal Singh, a 65-year-old farmer from UP, pointed out that the young people in his village were ready to work even under a trader for Rs 2,000 but they do not wish to become farmers.“For ages they have seen their families struggle to get farm loans. Whatever money they make out of farming, a good portion of it goes into repaying the loan, and they are left with a meagre sum. How do we change their perceptive? Has any government ever acted for the farmers till date,” he asked. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/seeing-our-plight-our-children-no-longer-want-to-become-farmers-180434
05-12-2020||New Delhi||In second comments on farmers’ stir, Trudeau welcomes de-escalation||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar may not attend a meeting of Canada-led 14-nation grouping, apparently in protest against Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s observations on the farmers’ protest.Meanwhile, the office of the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said people have a right to demonstrate peacefully and authorities should let them do so. Several MPs of Indian-origin and some from Green and Labour parties from the UK, Canada and Australia have also commented on the stir.To a question on the farmers’ protests in India, the spokesperson for Guterres framed the reply in broad terms.“As to the question of India, what I would say is what I’ve said to others when raising these issues is that people have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and authorities need to let them do so,” said Stephane Dujarric.Trudeau, in his second comments on the farmers’ stir, said, “Canada will always stand up for the right for peaceful protest and for human rights around the world and we are pleased to see moves toward de-escalation and dialogue.’’India had reacted sharply to his first comment when he used words such as “concern”.The MEA had then summoned the Canadian envoy and issued a statement terming the comments as “ill-informed and unwarranted as the matter pertained to the internal affairs of a democratic country”.Meanwhile, Jaishankar reportedly has scheduling issues on Tuesday, making it difficult for him to attend the next meeting of the 14-nation Covid group that spans four continents. India had joined the group last month in recognition of its critical role in addressing global Covid vaccine and pharmaceutical needs.The Canada-led Ministerial Coordination Group of Covid-19 (MCGC) has been meeting regularly for over eight months and includes three RCEP and UNSC permanent members each. The Indian side has been hinting at political motives behind Trudeau’s comments with MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava stating earlier this week that “it is best that diplomatic conversations are not misrepresented for political purposes”.With farmers having met government representatives several times, Trudeau in his second comments had welcomed “the move to dialogue and de-escalation”.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently virtually addressed a gathering of businesspersons from Canada and India, a move seen as bringing back focus of bilateral ties to investment and trade. The two envoys, Ajay Bisaria and Nadir Patel, were also taking coordinated initiatives to move forward bilateral ties.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-second-comments-on-farmers-stir-trudeau-welcomes-de-escalation-180431

It is highly objectionable and audacious. It is a malicious attack on the hon’ble Supreme Court.”A three-judge Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra (since retd) had held Bhushan guilty of contempt of court in August for scandalising the Judiciary by his tweets against CJI Bobde and four former CJIs. He was fined Re 1 which he has already deposited.He has already paid the fine and challenged the conviction verdict. While paying the fine imposed on him for criminal contempt of court, Bhushan had said, “I don’t accept the verdict.” He has also sought a review of the verdict.The Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) had in September issued a notice to Bhushan asking him to explain why proceedings should not be initiated to revoke his enrolment as a lawyer.The BCD had acted on the directions of the Bar Council of India – which regulates legal profession in the country—to “examine” Bhushan’s contemptuous tweets against the CJI and four ex-CJIs following his conviction by the Supreme Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lawyer-wants-fresh-contempt-proceedings-against-prashant-bhushan-180430
05-12-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||LDF, Cong flay Centre's decision to name Rajiv institute campus after RSS ideologue||The ruling LDF and opposition Congress in Kerala on Saturday flayed the Centre's decision to name the second campus of Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology here after late RSS ideologue MS Golwalkar, alleging that the BJP was communalising everything and questioned his contribution to science.Amid the opposition to the move, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan urged Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, to reconsider the decision to name the new campus after Golwalkar and instead name it after some eminent Indian scientist of international repute.The institute is a premier research institution and has been above political divides, Vijayan said in a letter to the Union Minister.The RGCB, which was initially run by the state government, was handed over to the Union Government with an aim of developing it into a centre of international standards in research and development, he said.Keeping this in view, the state government is of the opinion that the campus should be named after some eminent Indian scientist of International repute instead of the proposed name, Vijayan added."I request you to reconsider the decision, if it has already been taken, or not to contemplate such a decision, if already not taken. I hope that your ministry will consider favourably our proposal to name the new campus after an eminent Indian scientist,” the CM wrote to Harsh Vardhan.“This will keep up the reputation of the institution and help avoid controversies in the public domain," Vijayan said.Slamming the decision, LDF convener and CPI(M) state secretary A Vijayaraghavan said: "The BJP is attempting to bring communal elements to the forefront. As part of this plan, they decided to name the new campus of the RGCB after Golwalkar.”“BJP aims to communalise everything," he said.Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor and Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Ramesh Chennithala also came out against the decision.Tharoor, in a series of tweets, asked whether the Centre wanted to "memorialise a bigoted Hitler-admirer?""As for Rajiv Gandhi's contribution, he inspired scientific innovation & allocated funds for it. Are there no BJP icons who've at least tried2do (sic) the same thing? Must GoI memorialise a bigoted Hitler-admirer who in a 1966 speech to VHP asserted the supremacy of religion over science?" Tharoor tweeted.He also suggested the name of Dr Palpu, a renowned bacteriologist and social reformer, born in Thiruvananthapuram in 1863.Tharoor said Palpu was an expert in serum therapy and tropical medicine from Cambridge and Director of the Vaccine Institute and Fellow of the Royal Institute of Public Health."This forward-looking scientist & medical practitioner would be far more appropriate than an obscurantist ideologue of no scientific achievement & no discernible contribution to public health.“It's a BJP insult to Thiruvananthapuram & should be resisted. @drharshvardhan," Tharoor tweeted.Chennithala said naming the campus after Golwalkar was not acceptable and added that he had written to the Prime Minister, requesting that the decision be withdrawn."Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was a great leader who laid the foundation for modern India and encouraged the progress made by the country in the field of science and technology.“What was the share of Golwalkar in the field of science and technology in the country? The Centre should withdraw the move," Chennithala said in a statement.Senior CPI leader and former minister Mullakkara Ratnakaran had on Friday expressed shock and also suggested the name of Dr Palpu for the institution, saying "he fought against casteist abuse of the downtrodden while providing his services to the medical sector”."There is no other person in the history of this country who has spread so much hatred. No one should be allowed to sow such poisonous seeds in the land where reformers like Sree Narayana Guru, Ayyankali and Chattambi Swami have flourished the ideas of renaissance," Ratnakaran posted on Facebook.Union Minister for Science and Technology Dr Harsh Vardhan on Friday said the second campus of RGCB, a major knowledge centre and hub for mid and high level innovation, would be named 'Shri Guruji Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar National Centre for Complex Disease in Cancer and Viral Infection.'     He made the announcement while addressing a curtain raiser session of the sixth edition of India International Science Festival (IISF) scheduled for December 22-25, held online and organised by the RGCB.

05-12-2020||---||Tomar  tells farmers to leave the path of agitation, give suggestions||New Delhi , December 5Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has once again urged farmer leaders to leave the path of agitation and give suggestions to resolve the issues related to farm legislations.After a four-hour-long meeting with farmer leaders on Saturday, the minister said: "Today we held fifth round of talks with farmers. The talks were held in good positive atmosphere. We assured farmers that MSP will continue, but if someone has doubts, the government is ready for discussion.”Tomar also said: "The government does not wish to disturb state mandis and rather we are ready to strengthen the APMC mandis further.""There was talk on various issues. We wanted suggestions on some issues but it could not happen,” he said, adding, “Now another meeting will take place on December 9.”“We will discuss all the issues... But if there would have been some suggestions from farmers’ unions it would have been better,” he pointed out.Tomar also urged the farmers to send home the aged and children protesting against the legislations."I have said in the meeting and here also I will say that elderly persons and children should be sent back,” he said.“I want to assure that Modi government is completely dedicated to farmers and their welfare. This is demonstrated by pro-farmer steps taken by the government in the last six years.“We give Rs 75,000 crore every year as PM-KISAN… this was possible only under PM Modi," Tomar said."I want to assure farmers that the government is committed to the welfare of farmers. When there are talks there are several issues, when I say we are committed they should understand that all steps will be in favour of the farmers," he added.The Agriculture Minister also thanked union leaders for “maintaining discipline” during their protest. However, he urged them to end the agitation.“I will like to urge farmers to leave the path of agitation and come for talks. In the last meeting several points were identified,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tomar-tells-farmers-to-leave-the-path-of-agitation-give-suggestions-180426
05-12-2020||---||Farmers’ agitation: Protest sites named after historic personalities||New Delhi, December 5BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) has nominated five protest sites after the names of historical personalities representing the legacy of struggles leading up to the ongoing agitation against farm Bills passed by the Modi government.The protest site spread over kilometres have been divided into cities named after these personalities – Baba Banda Singh Nagar, Chacha Ajit Singh Nagar, Bibi Gulab Kaur Nagar, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar and Shaheed Sadhu Singh Takhtupura Nagar.Shingara Singh Mann, general secretary of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan), and Harinder Kaur Bindu shared the whole information with the press and the logic behind these names.They shared that a press gallery had been established and named as Shaheed Ashfaq Ullah Khan press gallery.They shared that Baba Banda Singh Bahadar was a great hero of farmers as he gave land entitlements to the tillers after an intense fight against the rulers.Mann stated that Chacha Ajit Singh was the founder of glorious anti-imperialist movement ‘Paghdi Sambhal Jatta’, which remains an inspiration for the struggling masses.He further said Gadri Gulab Kaur was great inspiration as she was part of anti-imperialist movement.The women protesters represent the continuity of Gadri Gulab Kaur, Mann said.Harinder Bindu, meanwhile, said that Shaheed Bhagat Singh imagined a society free of exploitation and oppression, and became Shaheed-e-Azam and was an inspiration for the ongoing agitation.His images inspire farmers, workers, women and youth, said Bindu.Bindu further said that Shaheed Sadhu Singh Takhtupura was leading light for the struggling masses.Shaheed Sadhu Singh Takhtupura was assassinated by land mafia patronised by BJP-SAD. Takhtupura was a leader of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) fighting against land mafia and his martyrdom motivated the organisation to build mass movements on people’s issues, said Bindu.The leaders explained that the sites named after these legendary personalities manifest the progressive and secular character of the ongoing agitation against farm laws.The ongoing movement is in continuity with the glorious history created by struggling masses and that history inspires farmers, workers, women and youth to struggle against the injustice, they said.The duo remained confident that the ongoing movement would carry the people’s history forward and emerge victorious.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-agitation-protest-sites-named-after-historic-personalities-180420
05-12-2020||New Delhi||Women protesters at Ghazipur border face inconvenience due to lack of clean toilets||Sita Arya, 34, who is part of the farmers’ protest at the Ghazipur border, wakes up at 4 am and walks nearly two kilometres to use a public lavatory.This has been her routine for the past few days as there are no clean facilities available at the demonstration site.“If we use toilets at the protest site, if not of the coronavirus, we will die due to the unhygienic conditions of the toilets,” Sita, who hails from Amroha in Uttar Pradesh, said, citing instances where women were forced to defecate in the open.Sita, who is herself a farmer, is among 50 other women from various parts of UP who have been camping at the border for the last five days along with their male counterparts as part of the protest against the Centre’s new farm laws.The unclean temporary toilets have forced the protesting women to either use empty plots or agriculture fields nearby.The women protesters complained that even though temporary toilets have been set up by the authorities at the border, none of them can be used as they are in a very unhygienic condition and stink because there is no facility to clean them after usage. This has compelled Sita to wake up early morning daily just to use a toilet.She along with two other women walk around two kilometres from the protest site and pay Rs five to use the toilet and Rs 10 to take a bath there.The protesting woman said unhygienic toilets and defecating in the open are not the only problems, their safety is also a big concern. They are compelled to spend sleepless night under the flyover, another woman protester said. “Our safety is in our hands,” said the women, who take turns to sleep in the night.They said at least three women stay awake all night to ensure that the group of women can sleep in peace.“We take turns to sleep at night. We have to look out for our own safety. Since we are under the open, we need to stay extra vigilant especially at night because any outsider can enter the area.“So we take turns to sleep,” said Seema, another protestor, who has left her two young children back home at her village to participate in the protest.Forty-year-old Jayanti, who along with her husband came from Shahjahanpur district said, “We will continue to protest here until our demands are met. We don’t have proper sanitisation facilities, lack hygienic toilets, no space to change clothes but still we are ready to fight our battle.”             Sita said the woman have no other option than walking through the empty road early morning to use the toilet.She said “Are we even left with any option? I sit for ‘havan’ here and without taking a bath, I cannot perform the rituals.“We don’t have bathing facilities and the temporary toilets set up here are so unhygienic that once used, it cannot be used again because it is not being cleaned on a regular basis.”              Recalling an incident where a woman had to defecate in an empty plot due to unclean toilets, Sita said “Yesterday afternoon, one of our women wanted to go to the toilet. But when she went to the jungle area behind, a man came there and she had to run from there. This is how unsafe it is for women and then our prime minister has given the call of ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/women-protesters-at-ghazipur-border-face-inconvenience-due-to-lack-of-clean-toilets-180417

I do not believe in the politics of violence and never indulge in such kinds of things. I challenge Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who is also the police minister to say it in public that I have such kind of taste.“I was never involved in such things when I was with her party and not now when I am a member of another political party. I have total faith in the judiciary of our country," Roy told PTI.BJP's national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya termed the CID 's action against Roy as  the "conspiracy of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee"."Mamta Banerjee's conspiracy continues. The false murder chargesheet against Mukul Roy shows how she is trying to suppress the opposition by her conspiracy. When Mamata Banerjee herself is a guest for (a) few days she should think what is going to happen after this," said Vijayvargiya.The BJP's Bengal minder was referring to the state polls due in April-May 2021. The saffron party is upbeat after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls when it bagged 18 of the 42 Parliamentary seats in the state.The state investigating agency had named BJP MP Jagannath Sarkar in the first supplementary chargesheet it had filed in September in connection with the killing of the TMC leader.Biswas was shot dead during a Saraswati Puja programme in Nadia district in February 2019.The state agency had filed its chargesheet in connection with the murder in May that year.

But the government says the MSP system will continue and the new laws will give farmers more options to sell their crop.The government is holding talks with farmers, who have called for a 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 and threatened to occupy toll plazas.

Jharkhand, the only remaining state, has now communicated its acceptance of Option-1,” the ministry said in a  statement.Union Territories of Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir and Puducherry have accepted Option 1.The states & UTs who choose Option-1 are getting the amount of shortfall arising out of GST implementation through a special borrowing window put in place by the Centre.The Centre has already borrowed Rs 30,000 crore on behalf of the states in five installments and has passed it on to 26 states and 3 UTs on October 23, November 2, November 9, November 23 and December 1.From the next round of borrowings, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh too would receive funds raised through this window. Earlier this week, Chhattisgarh communicated its acceptance for the borrowing plan.The next installment of Rs 6,000 crore will be released to the states/UTs on December 7, 2020, the ministry added.Under the terms of Option-1, besides getting the facility of a special window for borrowings to meet the revenue shortfall, states are also entitled to get unconditional permission to borrow the final installment of 0.50 per cent of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) out of the 2 per cent additional borrowings permitted by the Centre.This is over and above the special window of Rs 1.1 lakh crore.   On receipt of the choice of Option-1 from Jharkhand, the Centre has granted additional borrowing permission of Rs 1,765 crore to Jharkhand government (0.5 per cent of Chhattisgarh’s GSDP), it added.Separately, Jharkhand will get Rs 1,689 crore through special borrowing window to meet the GST revenue shortfall.Under the borrowing plan (Option-1), the Centre would borrow from market Rs 1.10 lakh crore which is the revenue shortfall on account of GST implementation. The remaining Rs 73,000 crore shortfall is estimated to be the revenue impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.The second option given by the Centre was that the states borrow the entire Rs 1.83 lakh crore collection shortfall.Opposition-ruled states were initially against the borrowing plan, saying that the Centre should borrow the entire GST revenue shortfall and compensate the states.

05-12-2020||Kolkata||Farmers’ agitation: SAD leader Chandumajra meets TMC leaders in Kolkata||Representatives of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Saturday met senior leaders of West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) here in a bid to unite various regional parties of the country to lend support to the farmers agitating against the farm Bills passed by the Modi government.A SAD team led by the party’s senior vice president Prem Singh Chandumajra had a meeting with Sudip Chattopadhyay and Derek O’Brien, leaders of TMC at Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, respectively, at the Trinamool Bhavan here in this connection.Later, talking to media persons, Chandumajra said the protests at Delhi-Haryana border, though spearheaded by farmers, had started getting support from all sections of the society.Similarly, though the movement had started from Punjab, its appeal had spread far and wide. The message sent out by the agitation had even travelled beyond the border as the remarks by the Canadian Prime Minister had shown, Chandumajra said.The SAD leader, who revealed that he had a telephonic conversation with West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee two days back, said it was time that political parties also threw their weight behind the agitating farmers.The former Anandpur Sahib MP said the farm Bills, besides paving the way for corporatisation of agriculture, also amounted to an assault on federalism since agriculture was a state subject.The loss of the mandi fees or taxes as envisaged by the Bills was bound to upset states, he said.Noting that the SAD led by Parkash Singh Badal and Sukhbir Singh Badal was a pioneer among the regional parties, Chandumajra said Mamata Banerjee was a premier leader of a regional party.The SAD senior vice president said he would meet the leaders of other regional parties also to mobilise support.This would be followed by a meeting of representatives of various regional parties in Delhi to draw up a strategy to strengthen the ongoing agitation by farmers. The proposed meeting in Delhi would take place sometime in the middle of December, Chandumajra said.TMC leader Sudip Bandopadhyay said if the Central government really wanted to retain the system of grain procurement by state agencies, there ought to have been mention of MSP in the farm Bills. He said the Bills should be withdrawn or sent to standing committee or a select committee of Parliament.On the Bharat bandh on December 8 called by the agitators, Bandopadhyay said while TMC would extend moral support to the call, its volunteers would not take part in enforcing it. Mamata Banerjee has already announced that she is wholly supporting the agitation by farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-agitation-sad-leader-chandumajra-meets-tmc-leaders-in-kolkata-180404
05-12-2020||Hyderabad||TRS may need support of others to win GHMC Mayoral election||The ruling TRS in Telangana has emerged as the single largest party in the GHMC polls, but it may need the support of others to retain the Mayor's post, notwithstanding its strength of ex-officio members, who can participate in voting.The results of 149 wards out of the total 150 were declared on Saturday (counting was stopped in one ward on Friday owing to a legal issue) and TRS is the single largest party after winning 55 seats.The Lok Sabha MPs and MLAs who have their vote in the city are ex-officio members of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), official sources said.Besides this, the MLCs and Rajya Sabha members, who have their vote in the city, have to give an option of choosing the GHMC to be able to vote in the Mayoral poll, they said.The sources put the number of ex-officio members as of Saturday at 49 though clarity on the matter may emerge when notification for the Mayoral election is issued.Out of the 49, the strength of TRS is 31.The party-wise number of ex-officio members is AIMIM- 10, Congress-1 and BJP-3, the sources claimed.However, the ex-officio members should not have voted six months ago in the same capacity (in a local body).Some of the ex-officio members of GHMC had voted in suburban municipalitiesearlierand they are not eligible to vote.The Municipal Administration Department would send the details on the status of such ex-officio members to the GHMC, the sources said.According to some analysts, TRS may fall short of about 10 members and it may need the support of AIMIM.This is an option for the TRS to win the Mayor's post.However, the TRS may not be too keen on joining hands with the AIMIM, as the BJP, during the GHMC poll campaign had accused the ruling party of having an unholy alliance with the Asaduddin Owaisi-led party.The AIMIM staying away from the Mayoral election would also help the cause of TRS.Separately, the newly-elected GHMC ward members would have to wait till February to take oath as the term of the present body ends on February 10.In the GHMC polls, TRS won 55, while the BJP, AIMIM and Congress secured 48, 44 and two wards respectively. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trs-may-need-support-of-others-to-win-ghmc-mayoral-election-180402
05-12-2020||Patna||Tejashwi leads opposition parties’ dharma in support of agitating farmers||The opposition parties on Saturday held demonstration here under the leadership of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav in protest against new farm laws and pledged support to the farmers agitating for repeal of the legislations.Joined by leaders of Congress and the Left parties at the dharna site, the RJD leader extended support to the nationwide strike called by the farmers’ organisations against the agricultural legislations on December 8.Barring CPI-ML other constituents of the Grand Alliance were present at the sit-in.The Communist Party of India (Marxist Leninsts) (Liberation) did not participate in the dharna organised by the RJD as the party had organised "road blockade" across Bihar during the day to protest against the farm laws, party’s state secretary Kunal told PTI.Besides, the party did not receive any information with regard to the RJD’s dharna, Kunal added.Tejashwi and others were denied permission by the district administration to hold dharna in front of the statue of Father of the Nation inside Gandhi Maidan following which they held the protest outside gate number four of the sprawling grounds in the heart of the capital town.Later, the administration allowed a handful of the leaders including Tejashwi Yadav, RJD Bihar unit chief Jagadanand Singh, former minister Shyam Rajak, Congress leaders Madan Mohan Jha and Ajeet Sharma and those from the Left to go inside Maidan to garland the statue of Mahatama Gandhi where they expressed resolve to continue their support to the agitating farmers.RJD had on Friday announced that dharna would be held in front of the statue of Mahatma Gandhi whose vision was under attack from the proposed legislations which intend to give a leeway to big private players in agriculture sector.A senior Patna district administration official, wishing anonymity, told PTI that "dharna inside Gandhi Maidan is not allowed as it is a 'prohibited area'. If anyone has to stage a sit-in, they can do so at Gardanibagh which has been declared as designated place to hold dharna”.Besides, the administration has to ensure that COVID-19 rules are adhered to, he said, adding that gathering or any sort of procession, dharna are not allowed at a public place in view of the coronavirus pandemic.Yadav, who is the younger son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad took a swipe at the NDA government in the state for not allowing them to hold protest inside the Gandhi Maidan."The day when a top leader of the believers of killer of the Father of the Nation is in the town, the BJP government in the state has locked Mahatama Gandhi inside the maidan," the RJD leader said taking a veiled dig at Mohan Bhagwat who is in the town to hold meeting with the RSS functionaries."I am standing with the Annadata (providers of food) in their fight against the Dhandata (people who owns wealth). Is it a crime to raise voice in support of farmers demanding provision for Minimum Support Price (MSP) in the newly enacted laws? If it is a crime, then we will commit such crimes every time," Tejashwi said in a tweet.The Central government has taken a decision (bringing farm laws) after giving due consideration in order to privatise everything, Tejashwi said, adding, "We have been saying it for quite a long time that they (BJP) will sell everything if they come to power. It is becoming a reality now.”"What is the problem in giving assurance for MSP to farmers for their produce? If it (MSP) is not ensured then, farmers will be ruined."The ruling JD(U) attacked Yadav for himself sitting on a raised platform during demonstration while others, including Jgadanand Singh, sat on the ground."Will @yadavtejashwi tell the people as why he is trying to show him (Jagadanand Singh) his status by making him sit at his feet. Jagada babu is a symbol while your intention is to trample the social grouping."The prince of jungle raj should reply whether your motive has been fulfilled," JD(U) spokesman Neeraj Kumar said in a tweet.One brother (Tej Pratap Yadav) refered to the late RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh  as "a lota (pot) of water that makes no difference to an ocean" while another made senior party leader Jagadanand Singh sit at his feet during the dharna, said Neeraj.Jagadanand Singh is a close associate of Lalu Prasad.The JD(U) leader was referring to Tejashwi’s statement during Assembly polls when he said the poor used to walk before "Babu Saheb", a term used to refer to upper caste Rajputs in Bihar, with their head held high when Lalu Prasad was in power.The casteist remarks had triggered controversy following which the RJD leader had come with his defence that he was actually refering to "Sarkari Babus" (government officials) who have been denying justice to the weaker sections under the patronage of Nitish Kumar government.

05-12-2020||Mumbai||Arnab, two others accused of ignoring Anvay Naik's suicide threat||The chargesheet filed against Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and two others in a 2018 abetment of suicide case says that the accused did not pay heed to victim Anvay Naik's threat that he would end his life if his dues were not cleared by the trio.The chargesheet also said that Naik, who was under mental stress due to non-payment of dues by the accused, first strangled his mother Kumud, a partner in his business, before hanging himself to death.The police on Friday filed the chargesheet before a court in Alibaug in neighbouring Raigad district, where the case for alleged abetment of suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother had been registered.Besides Goswami, the other two accused named in the chargesheet are Firoze Sheikh and Nitish Sarda."The victim (Naik) had told them (accused) that he would commit suicide if they don't pay his dues. However, the accused ignored his threat and told him to do whatever he wants," read the chargesheet."The accused didn't pay his dues, which caused mental stress to Naik. He first strangulated his mother, thinking that she might land in trouble as she was also a partner in his business," it said.Naik later wrote a suicide note and then hanged himself, the chargesheet added.Police said that they had relied on the purported suicide note as the "dying declaration".Naik's handwriting has been matched with the writing in the suicide note and forensic report indicated that he was not under pressure while writing it, police said.Police had earlier said that in his suicide note, Naik, who owned Concorde Designs Pvt Ltd, had claimed that he was ending his life due to non-payment of dues by Goswami, Firoze Sheikh of IcastX/Skimedia and Nitish Sarda of Smartworks.Police said that as per the note, the three firms owed Naik's company Rs 83 lakh, Rs 4 crore and Rs 55 lakh respectively.The court will take cognisance of the chargesheet on December 16, Rahul Agarwal, advocate for one of the accused, said on Saturday.The accused trio has been charged under IPC sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 109 (punishment for abetment) and 34 (common intention).As many as 65 persons were named as witnesses in the chargesheet that runs into 1,914 pages.Police have listed statements of family members and staff of Naik, call data records, and information retrieved from electronic devices as evidence in the case.In May this year, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had announced that he had ordered a fresh probe in the case after a complaint by Adnya Naik, daughter of architect Anvay Naik.Goswami, Sheikh and Sarda were arrested by Alibaug Police on November 4 in the case, but they got bail from the Supreme Court on November 11.

05-12-2020||New Delhi||First Bihar, now Hyderabad: A new political blueprint featuring BJP and AIMIM to disarm regional satraps?||The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) may have emerged as the single-largest party in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls but it is the BJP which stole the show as the runner-up in the closely-contested local bodies’ elections.And while the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) trailed the BJP, it emerged the kingmaker giving a reason to observers to sense a new political blueprint featuring BJP and AIMIM for Muslim-dominated regions to disarm regional satraps.The BJP election machine managed to turn the local bodies’ election into a national event replete with saffron verbosity and star campaigners, including Home Minister Amit Shah, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath , BJP president JP Nadda and BYJM president Tejasvi Surya, leading from the front in true BJP style with offers ranging from changing the name of Hyderabad to ‘Bhagyanagar’ to  ‘emancipating’ people from ‘Nawabi rule’.Notably, Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM won an unprecedented five seats in Bihar’s Seemanchal region in recently concluded assembly elections, becoming one of the reasons behind the RJD-led alliance suffering losses and the JD-U-BJP alliance forming the government. In Hyderabad while AIMIM held to its own, BJP’s gains came from TRS, say the observers wondering if the saffron party could have managed it so well without AIMIM presenting the opposite pole in the highly-polarised GHMC pollsFirst Dubakka and now GHMC (which covers as many as 24 assembly constituencies) has given the BJP a big boost in Telangana and neighbouring Andhra Pradesh where the party fared rather poorly in the last elections. A bastion of the KCR family, Dubakka Assembly constituency is adjacent to Gajwel (which is represented by Chief Minister KCR) Sircilla (his son KT Rama Rao’s constituency) and Siddipet (his nephew T Harish Rao’s seat).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-bihar-now-hyderabad-a-new-political-blueprint-featuring-bjp-and-aimim-to-disarm-regional-satraps-180386

Hopefully, in the 75th year of independence, the Parliament session will be held in the new building," he said.Birla said the new building will be earthquake resistant and 2000 people will be directly involved in the construction of the new building and 9,000 indirectly.He said as many as 1,224 MPs can sit together in the building, while a new office complex for all MPs of both the houses would be built at the site of the existing Shram Shakti Bhawan.The existing Parliament building will be conserved as it is an archaeological asset of the country, Birla said.He said the invitation will be extended to all political parties. While some would attend physically and others would attend virtually, Birla said, while adding that the ceremony would follow Covid-related guidelines.A formal invitation to Modi was extended by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Saturday. As per rules, the speaker of the lower house of parliament is also the custodian of the parliament building.Sufficient steps have been taken to control air and noise pollution during the construction work for the new parliament building, which will have separate offices for all MPs and those will be equipped with the latest digital interfaces as a step towards creating 'paperless offices'.The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India's democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space.In the new building, the Lok Sabha chamber will have a seating capacity for 888 members, while Rajya Sabha will have 384 seats for the upper house members.This has been done keeping in mind the future increase in the number of members for the two houses.At present, Lok Sabha has a sanctioned strength of 543 members and Rajya Sabha of 245.In September this year, Tata Projects Limited won the bid to construct the new parliament building at a cost of Rs 861.90 crore. The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project.The existing Parliament House building will be suitably retro-fitted to provide more functional spaces for parliamentary events, to ensure its usage along with the new building.The existing building is a massive circular edifice of 560 feet in diameter. The Parliament House Estate is enclosed by an ornamental red sandstone wall or iron grills with iron gates that can be closed when occasions demand.

05-12-2020||New Delhi||MeToo: Akbar did not have a sterling reputation, Ramani tells court||Journalist Priya Ramani on Saturday told a Delhi court hearing a criminal defamation complaint filed by former union minister M J Akbar against her that he did not have a 'sterling reputation' as claimed by him.Ramani, who had accused Akbar of sexual misconduct around 20 years ago, stated this through senior advocate Rebecca John during the final hearing of the matter.She claimed before the court that a number of women have accused Akbar of sexual misconduct and, by his own account, he was having a consensual relationship while he was married to someone else, “which was not a sterling reputation”.Akbar had filed the complaint against Ramani for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct around 20 years ago when he was a journalist.Ramani had said the allegations against Akbar, made in the wake of the #MeToo movement in 2018, were her truth and were made in the public good.“He (Akbar) himself says he was in a consensual relationship (with one of his juniors, who, during the #MeToo movement, accused him of rape) which was hampering his family life. Is this the conduct of the man with a sterling reputation? As a man who is married to someone else, he is having a consensual relationship...“At least 15-16 women tweeted against Akbar. Akbar was, according to himself, in a relationship with a junior who was 20 years younger... this is not sterling reputation,” John told Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) Ravindra Kumar Pandey.She claimed in the court that many women had made allegations against Akbar but he chose to file the case against only Ramani.“He knew there were other women... he has admitted before the court about reading an article which carried allegations by several women,” she said.As the hearing remained inconclusive, the court will take up the matter on December 10.Akbar had filed the complaint against Ramani on October 15, 2018.He had resigned as union minister on October 17, 2018.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as 'media's biggest predator' that harmed his reputation.Akbar has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment made against him by the women who came forward during the #MeToo campaign.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/metoo-akbar-did-not-have-a-sterling-reputation-ramani-tells-court-180377

Due to the fact that there are many documents that have been annexed to the Chief Examination of the Complainant, which are public documents, which have been marked; these are certified copies of these public documents," the application said."Due to the fact that these are marked documents, these documents need to be proved through the testimony of the appropriate witnesses. It is reiterated that as the complainant's case is a quintessential case of the evidence being documentary evidence, therefore these documents need to be proved through their witnesses,” it said.Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravinder Kumar Pandey on Saturday adjourned the matter for December 23 as the lawyers from the accused side did not appear physically and sought an adjournment.Earlier, the court had asked both the parties to explore the solution for proceeding with the matter in view of the COVID-19 situation.Swamy, in a private criminal complaint, has accused the Gandhis and others of conspiring to cheat and misappropriate funds by paying just Rs 50 lakh, through which the Young Indian (YI) Private Limited obtained the right to recover the Rs 90.25 crore of the Associated Journals Limited (AJL), the publisher of National Herald newspaper, owed to the Congress.All the seven accused in the case—Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, senior Congress leaders Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, Suman Dubey and Sam Pitroda and Young Indian—have denied the allegations levelled against them.The Gandhis, Vora, Fernandes, Dubey and Pitroda are accused of misappropriation of property, criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal conspiracy. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/national-herald-case-subramanian-swamy-seeks-summoning-of-documents-witnesses-180375

05-12-2020||Jaipur||Ex-banker uses pressure cooker steam to cure post-COVID symptoms||A retired banker, now a naturopath, is using a pressure cooker to generate medicinal steam to cure post-COVID symptoms of people and to boost immunity by using herbs such as ginger, ‘chirata’, ‘kutki’, carom seeds, lemon juice and neem leaves.A pipe is connected to a pressure cooker which extends into a bathroom where patients are asked to inhale the steam for 30 minutes.Besides inhaling the steam, the patient is asked to take mud therapy where black soil mixed with lemon juice is applied to his body and he is asked to rub it on his body for smooth blood circulation, says Pukhraj Vohra (65), who is operating a small naturopathy centre on the Rajasthan-MP border in Ratlam district.Many patients from the neighbouring districts of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra are visiting this centre to deal with their post COVID challenges. The line of treatment is quite different here. As soon as a patient enters this naturopathy centre, he is given juice made of ‘aamla’ and different herbs after which starts the steam session, a patient told IANS.Worried about the pandemic and its consequences, Vohra has used his knowledge gathered over the last three decades to help the people. He has been operating this three-storeyed naturopathy centre on his own, running here and there, listening to the stories of patients, bringing them out of depression, giving them Reiky treatment and many other such things.“We hug our patients with warmth and treat them. Wearing masks and following social distancing doesn’t fall in our system of naturopathy as what matters in COVID cases is immunity. We believe in building immunity so that the body can itself kill the coronavirus,” he says.Vohra questions why steam treatment is not given to all patients when it has a proven history of killing this virus. The high dose medicines are affecting the people’s vital organs and hence steam sessions should be made mandatory in COVID hospitals, he adds.Vohra was working in UCO Bank till a few years back. He took VRS to start his own naturopathy centre. He has a big library in his house which has a variety of books on different aspects of naturopathy.Aniket, 20, who had fever and breathing problems, says: “Hospitals looked like a challenge for me to go as there were negative reports coming in. I isolated myself and contacted Vohra who gave me regular steam sessions at home with mud therapy along with Aloe Vera, Giloa and Aamla juice. The oxygen level which was 84 shot up to 98 in three days and the fever went away too. This centre has a unique feature. It helped me to stand on my own in just three days. They applied mud with Rai on my chest and all the congestion went away in just a week,” he says.Aniket, speaking to IANS, said: “Doctors also doubted if I could be cured as my lung infection was quite severe. Testing was not so smooth in July and hence I did not go for it. But Vohraji helped me get better with each passing day.”Herbal juices, steam session, guava juice and jaggery lemon tea — this is how the treatment goes at the centre. Many patients are now visiting this centre.“I had a bad cough, depression, breathing trouble and other such ailments, however, all such symptoms vanished in four to five days after visiting here,” says another patient who tested negative a month back.There are many other patients who have found no solace at medical centres and have visited this place to get cured.“Naturopathy is a science which lost its sheen to allopathy. But COVID it seems has come to remind people of nature and to teach them to value it. They are back to their lost roots which is something quite positive in these testing times,” says Vohra adding that each person should know how he should boost his immunity.In fact, many patients after recovering are adopting this steam therapy in their bathrooms after going back to their homes in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi.Kalpit, another patient who underwent regular sessions, went back to Gujarat and installed the same steam system in his bathroom.“I had a cough which turned into asthma; after taking regular doses, I am ok now, but I wanted to be regular and hence installed this system,” he said.

Like in Delhi the notification was issued on 18.6.2020 fixing the maximum rate Rs 2400 and the cost of the kit and other things used in the test has gone down in the month of April-May itself, at the rate which is available at present," it said.Agrawal, in his PIL in which the interim plea has been filed, had sought direction for fixing the maximum rate as Rs 400 for RT-PCR test for COVID-19 uniformly all over India.While issuing the notice, the top court had said that the PIL would be heard with another pending plea of Sachin Jain pertaining to the cost of treatment for COVID-19."There is no other cost as the machines used for the RT-PCR test are already there with the laboratories as they conduct a large number of tests. And the matter is concerned with 135 crore citizen of the country as everybody is worried about the coronavirus and forced to get their test done at this exorbitant price," the PIL said.The plea alleged that the owners of the private laboratories and hospitals are using the calamity into opportunities for minting crores and crores of rupees. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-sc-seeks-refund-of-exorbitant-money-charged-for-rt-pcr-test-to-detect-covid-19-180368
05-12-2020||Mumbai||Winter onset: Mumbai, parts of Maharashtra see drop in temperature||With Mumbai recording the season's lowest minimum temperature at 18.4 degree Celsius on Saturday, and most other parts of Maharashtra also witnessing an overall drop in the mercury levels, it could be an onset of winter, an IMD official here said.Cyclones and severe depressions in the Bay of Bengal had delayed the arrival of winter in the state, the official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Mumbai said."With their weakening, several regions in the state have recorded a drop in the minimum temperature. This could be the beginning of the winter season in the state," he said.According to the IMD, the Santacruz observatory in Mumbai on Saturday morning recorded a minimum temperature of 18.4 degree Celsius, which is the lowest so far this season.The departure from normal temperature was by 1.4 degree Celsius.The same observatory had on Friday recorded a minimum temperature of 19 degree Celsius, a drop by one degree Celsius from the normal, the official said.On Saturday, some other regions of the state also witnessed a drop in the minimum temperature. Parbhani in Marathwada region recorded 10.6 degree Celsius, Gondia in Vidarbha region 10.5 degree Celsius, Nashik in north Maharashtra 11.1 degree Celsius and Satara and Pune in western Maharashtra 13 and 11.5 degree Celsius respectively, the IMD said.The highest departure in temperature was recorded at Parbhani, where it dropped four degree Celsius below normal, he said.Winter plays a crucial role in the growth of Rabi crops, such as jowar, wheat and green gram and also triggers flowering in mango trees."For good flowering of mango trees, there needs to be a drop in temperature. This will help the trees bear fruits from February onwards and can be harvested from April in Maharashtra," an agriculture expert said.Maharashtra is a major producer and exporter of Alphonso mangoes in the country. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/winter-onset-mumbai-parts-of-maharashtra-see-drop-in-temperature-180367

As India’s IT industry advances and its content economy grows, an effective IPR regime is foundational to achieving the government’s goal of a $1 trillion digital economy,” Biswal said in her address.“IPR protections also support the success of Digital India, Make-in-India and other cornerstone initiatives,” Biswal, who previously served as Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs in the US Department of State, said.On Thursday, India and the US signed an MoU to increase cooperation in the field of intellectual property (IP) by facilitating exchange and dissemination of best practices, collaboration in training programs and outreach activities.The two sides will draw up a biennial work plan to implement the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which will include detailed planning for carrying out cooperation activities, including the scope of action, it said.The 3rd annual IP Dialogue, attended by government and industry leaders, proved to be incredibly impactful, with intellectual property playing such a key role in efforts to study and combat the ongoing global pandemic, a media release said.“The IP Dialogue is an opportunity for the US and Indian governments to come together to discuss an issue critical to our bilateral relationship,” Biswal said.“This month’s promising news on vaccines and treatments for coronavirus is a signal that the UN framework for intellectual property is working,” said Patrick Kilbride, senior vice president of the US Chamber’s Global Innovation Policy Centre.“Globally, we’ve mounted an all-hands-on deck response, with the private sector leading the charge to deliver a safe, effective vaccine for this terrible disease. India, with its strong domestic industry and innovative capacity, can play a major role in fighting the pandemic— the time is now,” he said.“IP Dialogue: Opportunities for US-India Collaboration” featured experts from India’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), the US Patent and Trademark Office, the US Department of State, and the Office of the US Trade Representative, along with other government, private sector, and academic experts.Participants discussed a broad range of IP-related topics, including innovation, public-private partnership response to the pandemic, collaboration in fighting copyright and trademark infringement, best practices for technology transfer and IP commercialisation, and policy approaches to trade secrets in the digital age.Dialogue recommendations will be shared with both governments to deepen strategic cooperation on IP policy, the release said.

Since this is a two dose vaccine.The minister in question has taken only one dose of the vaccine,” a Health Ministry official said.Bharat Biotech also elaborated the design of the study and said COVAXIN has been designed to be efficacious. “COVAXIN clinical trials are based on a 2 dose schedule, given 28 days apart. The vaccine efficacy will be determined 14 days post the 2nd dose. COVAXIN has been designed to be efficacious when subjects receive both doses and post the 14 day period after the 2nd dose,” the company said.The phase 3 trials are double blinded and randomized, where 50 per cent of subjects will receive vaccine and 50 per cent of subjects will receive placebo.A double-blind study is one in which neither the participants nor the experimenters know who is receiving a particular treatment. This procedure is utilized to prevent bias in research results.COVAXIN is an fully indigenously developed COVID-19 vaccine, with the largest Phase 3 clinical trial conducted in India, in 26,000 subjects across 25 sites.The goal is evaluate the efficacy of COVAXIN across India.The phase 3 trials of COVAXIN is the only efficacy trial being conducted in India for COVID-19 vaccines, to determine its suitability to the diverse Indian population.Infection status doesn’t determine vaccine efficacy: ICMR chiefMeanwhile, the ICMR said infection status of an individual does not determine the efficacy of COVID vaccine.ICMR is collaborating with Bharat Biotech on COVAXIN, India’s indigenous COVID 19 vaccine.Speaking to The Tribune on the issue today, ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said, “Participation of political leaders in vaccine trial helps in allaying the fear from people’s mind related to such participation.“Anybody — either in the vaccine arm or in the placebo arm — can acquire infection.”Bhargava said final analysis would reveal if the vaccination arm had significantly lower infection rate among participants compared to that in placebo arm, resulting in estimation of efficacy of the vaccine, which is not 100 per cent in any vaccine.“Infection status of an individual does not determine vaccine efficacy at population level,” he said.COVAXIN in a double blind trial in which half of the participants receive the vaccine and another half receive the placebo, with neither the receiver nor the experimenter knows who is receiving what.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-health-ministry-says-covid-positive-anil-vij-took-only-one-dose-of-covid-vaccine-180364
05-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||First Bihar, now Hyderabad: A new political blueprint featuring BJP, AIMIM to disarm regional satraps?||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 5The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) may have emerged as the single-largest party in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls but it is the BJP which stole the show, winning as many as 48 wards in the closely-contested local bodies elections.And though the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) trailed the BJP to land the third spot, it emerged as the kingmaker in the highly-polarised polls with observers sensing a new political blueprint featuring the BJP and the AIMIM in Muslim-dominated areas to take on regional satraps.The BJP election machine managed to turn the local bodies’ election into a national event replete with saffron verbosity and star campaigners.Senior BJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, BJP president JP Nadda and BYJM president Tejasvi Surya, landed to lend the campaign true BJP colours.Notably, Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM, for the first time, won an unprecedented five seats in the Seemanchal region in Bihar, emerging as one of the main reasons for RLD-led alliance suffering losses and the JD-U-BJP alliance forming the government in the highly polarised state elections.In Hyderabad, while AIMIM held to its own, the BJP’s gains came from the TRS which came down substantially from what it won in the 2016 elections.Incidentally, the AIMIM which holds sway in Muslim-dominated parts of Hyderabad, had also fielded five Hindu candidates, according to reports.The Dubakka and now the GHMC, which covers as my as 24 Assembly Constituencies, has given the BJP much to hope in Telangana and also neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, where the party fared rather poorly in the last elections.Considered a bastion of the KCR family, Dubakka is close to Gajwel, which is represented by Chief Minister KCR, Sircilla, his son KT Rama Rao’s constituency, and Siddipet, his nephew T Harish Rao’s seat.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-bihar-now-hyderabad-a-new-political-blueprint-featuring-bjp-aimim-to-disarm-regional-satraps-180362

The Left parties extend their support to the call given by them for a Bharat Bandh on December 8,” the statement said.“The Left parties condemn the RSS/BJP’s malicious campaign, on preposterous charges, against the struggle of our annadatas to safeguard Indian agriculture and the country’s food security,” it said.The statement also said the Left parties supported the farmers’ demand for the scrapping of the three agri laws and the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2020.“The Left parties appeal to all other political parties and forces who stand with the farmers’ cause and have demanded the repeal of these laws to extend their support and cooperation to the December 8 bandh call,” it said.Hardening their position, agitating farmers on Friday announced a ‘Bharat Bandh’ on December 8 and said they would occupy toll plazas on that day if their demands for repealing the agri-marketing laws are not met.Talks between farmer leaders and Union Ministers have turned out to be futile so far.The farmers have rejected the Centre’s proposal of amending the laws and have instead demanded that a special session of parliament be called to repeal the laws.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/left-parties-extend-support-to-protesting-farmers-call-for-bharat-bandh-on-dec-8-180349

They have also called for a ‘Bharat bandh’ on December 8.Before the meeting with the government in the afternoon, leaders of around 40 farmer unions will discuss their strategy to press their demands.Also read: Canada opposes MSP, has scarce interest in well-being of Indian farmers: BJPAhead of crucial meeting with farmers, Union Ministers meet PMLeft parties extend support to protesting farmers’ call for ‘Bharat Bandh’ on Dec 8They have also given a call to protest against the Central Government and corporate houses, and burn their effigies on Saturday.The fourth-round talks between the government and agitating farmer unions on Thursday failed to end the standoff over the new farm laws.The blockade at the borders of Delhi, including at Tikri, Singhu, Jharoda, Ghazipur and Chilla, has thrown traffic out of gear.The diversion of traffic from these border points has led to long jams on alternative routes in the national capital.Police have kept the Delhi-Haryana border at Singhu, Tikri, Jharoda, Jhatikara, Auchandi, Lampur, Piao, Maniyari and Mangesh closed as the farmers’ agitation enter its tenth day.However, if anyone needed to commute towards Harayana, they can go via Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri National Highway-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera Borders, police said.The Badusarai border remained open only for light motor vehicles like cars and two wheelers, they said.The Chilla border on the Noida link road also remained closed for traffic from Noida to Delhi due to farmers protests near Gautam Budh Dwar.Similarly, police have kept the Ghazipur border on National Highway-24 shut for traffic coming from Ghaziabad to Delhi.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and scrap the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms would remain.On Wednesday, agitating farmers demanded that the Centre convene a special session of Parliament and repeal the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

05-12-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra MLC polls: ‘Overconfident’ BJP losing ground, says Sena||The Shiv Sena on Saturday said the results of the elections to five Maharashtra Legislative Council seats showed that the “overconfident” BJP was losing ground in the state.It said the most shocking defeat for the opposition party was its loss in the Nagpur division graduates’ constituency, which it held for over five decades.“In the Maharashtra Assembly elections held last year, the BJP had lost two and won three constituencies in Nagpur by a slender margin. Its downfall had begun that time and now it has significantly lost the ground,” an editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said.Union Minister Nitin Gadkari represented the Nagpur graduates’ constituency for 25 years and prior to him Gangadhar Fadnavis, father of Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, was the MLC, it said.“But in the RSS fortress, BJP candidate and Nagpur Mayor Sandeep Joshi bit the dust this time. The defeat wasn’t surprising since the party’s downfall had begun in the Assembly polls. The BJP is divided into Gadkari and Fadnavis camps,” it said.“Fadnavis had denied ticket to sitting MLC and Gadkari confidante Anil Sole,” the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.Even in Amravati division teachers’ constituency, the BJP lost, it said.“Graduates and teachers voted against the BJP in these elections. In the Dhule Nandurbar local bodies constituency, Amrish Patel, who had defected from the Congress to the BJP, won the election. But it is Patel’s personal victory and not that of the BJP,” it added.The Marathi daily said the Pune graduates’ constituency was also a BJP stronghold, which was earlier represented by Union minister Prakash Javadekar. It was earlier also held by state BJP president Chandrakant Patil.“When Patil represented the Pune graduates’ constituency, he became the state revenue minister. Now, under his leadership the party lost the Pune teachers’ as well as graduates’ seats,” it said.The Sena lashed out at Patil for saying that the BJP lost because it contested the elections alone.“The BJP was overconfident. It felt that it didn’t need anyone and can win alone. Good that it lost,” it added.“The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies contested all the seats together genuinely and worked for each other. When the Sena contested with the BJP, it had to face the BJP rebels,” it said.In a word of advice to ally Congress, the Sena said that in Nagpur, all factions and rivals of the Congress came together and fought against the BJP unitedly.“If this is done, a miracle like the Nagpur win can happen,” it said.The biennial elections to the Upper House were held on December 1. While Congress won the Nagpur graduates’ and Pune teachers’ constituencies, the NCP won Aurangabad graduates’ and Pune graduates’ seats. Independent Kiran Sarnaik won Amravati teachers’ seat.

05-12-2020||New Delhi||Fifth meeting between govt and farmer leaders ends inconclusively; call for Bharat Bandh on Dec 8 remains||The fifth round of talks between the BJP-led Central government and farmer’ leaders also ended without any breakthrough on Saturday.The next meeting is now scheduled for December 9, a day after the ‘Bharat bandh’ call by unions on December 8.“The government asked for some more time to present a concrete proposal. Ministers said they need further consultations within the government for that and proposed December 9 as the date for next meeting to which union leaders agreed,” said Kavitha Kuruganti of Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch, one of the 40 unions invited for the talks with Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Prakash on the contentious farm Acts.After the meeting, Tomar again urged farmers to leave the path of agitation and give ‘sujhav’ (suggestions) to resolve the issue.Therefore December 9 is the next meeting date proposed at 11 am.Farmer leaders said just like their agitation they put forth their points before the union ministers peacefully.They have agreed to the meeting on December 9. Farmer leaders said the government told them that after the amendments nothing will be left in the Bills, however, they persisted with their demands of complete roll back.Earlier, seeking to break the deadlock over protests against the new farm laws, the government on Saturday told representatives of agitating farmers that their concerns are being looked into but the union leaders stuck to their demand for repeal of the legislations and threatened to walk out of the talks.The government side, however, managed to convince the farmer leaders to continue the talks, which began at 2.30 pm earlier in the day.This was the fifth round of talks between the government and representatives of farmers, thousands of whom are protesting at various borders of the national capital against what they claim are the laws meant to end the mandi system and minimum support price procurement system to give for benefits of corporates.As the meeting resumed after a tea break in the evening, during which the farmer leaders had their own food and tea, they threatened to walk out if the government was not willing to scrap the three laws enacted in September.While the government managed to convince them to continue with the talks, sources said some kind of division emerged among the participating farmer leaders on various issues proposed by the ministers.Another source said the government also offered to take back cases filed against farmers for stubble burning, as also the cases filed against some farmer activists.Later in the evening, the ministers began talking to smaller groups of 3-4 farmer leaders, out of the total 40 representatives present there.Farmer leaders were firm, saying that either say 'yes' or 'no' on taking back the laws, even though ministers said that the government is ready for amendments to the laws .All members of delegation decided to keep silent. The government side was trying to draw us out, they said. Farmer leaders were trying to force the government to say in black and white if it will repeal the laws. The government was not responding to this pinpointed question, they said.Ahead of their meeting with farmers, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Home Minister Amit Shah and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the matter.Sources say Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has requested farmer leaders to ask elderly and young children to go back while farmers are saying that everyone is prepared to stay put.  So far there does not appear any middle path though.Farmers are also not ready to take back the call for ‘Bharat’ bandh.Sources say the three ministers, Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Prakash, are holding independent consultations.While the government is insisting on a middle path, farmer leaders are firm on their key demands around four hours into the meeting. Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is from Punjab, also addressed the leaders in Punjabi and said the government understands the sentiments of Punjab.While farmers are insisting on a special Parliament Session, ministers once again held closed door meeting, apparently to apprise senior leaders about the situation.The government wants a middle path and says it is ready for amendments.While the Opposition parties in states namely Bihar and Tamil Nadu are mounting pressure, the agitation is now being seen as a ‘jan andolan’ movement of farmers, common people, and youngsters and farmer leaders are also under tremendous pressure not to budge from the stated stance.The first round of talks for the day is over.Sources say there is a 15-minute break in the meeting, the government has given a written reply to unions on the issues related to changes in the laws.Farmers said they were willing to settle for nothing less than their stated stance and made it clear thar there was no middle path.The meeting between 40 farmer unions and the Centre will resume soon at Vigyan Bhawan.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal, Union Minister of State Som Prakash and Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal have joined the talks from the government side while the Bharatiya Kisan Union, the Bharatiya Kisan Sanyukt Morcha and the Krantikari Kisan Union are among the 40 farm organisations represented at the meeting.Ahead of the ‘nirnayak’ meeting, Tomar again expressed hope of positive results.Sources say Home Minister Amit Shah also called up many union leaders, asking them to end the agitation.Also read: Canada opposes MSP, has scarce interest in well-being of Indian farmers: BJPFarmers’ stir: Protesters continue to camp at Delhi borders; fifth-round of talks todayLeft parties extend support to protesting farmers’ call for ‘Bharat Bandh’ on Dec 8As support pours in from across the country, farmer leaders also fear “attempts by the government” to “malign/break the movement”. Farmer unions have given a call for ‘Bharat bandh’ on December 8. Farmers will also be burning effigies of the Modi government and corporate houses today.“It would have been better if they had given some suggestions,” the minister said after the four-hour plus meeting that followed four marathon consultations, three with Union ministers and one with Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agrawal, earlier. “The Narendra Modi government is committed to the welfare of farmers. Today we held fifth round of talks with farmers. We said MSP will continue but if someone still has doubts the government is ready to dispel them. State mandis will continue, rather we will further strengthen APMC. When I said we are committed to welfare of farmers they should understand that all steps will be in their favour,” he said in a replay of earlier meetings.“There were talks on various issues. We wanted suggestions on some issues but it did not happen.  Now another meeting will take place on December 9. We will discuss all the issues, but if there were some suggestions from farmer’ unions it would have been better. In the last meeting several points were identified,” he added.Farmer representatives today chose to keep a ‘maun vrat’ (remain silent) for quite some time, a good 40 minutes according to Jagmohan Singh Patiala of BKU (Dakonda), as Union ministers kept pressing with merits of the laws, the middle-path and suggested amendments.They also rejected Tomar’s suggestion to send elderly persons and children back home.Holding files with “yes” or “no” written on them as placards, they  kept insisting on their key demands-rolling back of the three “black” Central Acts, the Air Pollution Ordinance and the Electricity (Amendment) Bill.Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is from Punjab, said the government understands the sentiments of Punjab. He also tried to draw some of the leaders into conversation by speaking to them in Punjabi.“Tomar kept asking why are we are insisting on the demands when the government is ready to affect amendments and agree on many issues,” Jagmohan Singh said.President of the Krantikari Kisan Union Darshan Pal said ministers kept repeating about amendments even while unions told them that they don’t need amendments.“They said they will hold a meeting and send a fresh proposal by tomorrow evening,” he said. Farmer unions also gave examples of the support to their agitation, including from Canadian PM Justin Trudeau While the ministers pitched for a middle path, farmers said the prime minister should consider the sentiments of the people.“There was complete silence in the room for quite some time, on many occasions union leaders also tried to get up and leave,” they said.It remains to be seen what happens on Wednesday when the next meeting is planned. Unions are seeing it as yet another attempt to “stretch matters and buy time”.However, by keeping December 9 as the next date of the meeting, sources say the government has ensured that communication lines with farmers remain open till December 8, “otherwise the ‘Bharat bandh’ may have taken a different shape”.Amid consultations, the ministers held closed-door meeting, apparently also apprised other senior ministers about the proceedings. Ahead of their meeting with farmers, Tomar, Home Minister Amit Shah and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the first such meeting before talks with farmersWith the agitation now assuming the shape of a ‘jan andolan’, a movement of farmers, common people, and youngsters, the Opposition parties in states like Bihar and Tamil Nadu are also mounting pressure against the BJP. As support pours in from across the country, farmer leaders fear “attempts to malign/break the movement”. While farmer’ leaders are under tremendous pressure not to budge from the stated stance, the Centre is under attack for allowing the movement to fester for long and sound it like a Punjab agitation. Apparently Shah has individually called up several ‘jathebandis’, urging them to end the agitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fifth-meeting-between-govt-and-farmer-leaders-ends-inconclusively-call-for-bharat-bandh-on-dec-8-remains-180343

In order to ensure better road discipline and deter such violators of traffic laws, stringent actions need to be taken in accordance with the law.”“No Helmet No Petrol shall be enforced within the jurisdiction of Kolkata police to the effect that no petrol pump shall henceforth sell petrol to any such two-wheeler rider who arrives at the petrol pump riding two-wheeler without wearing a helmet as well as carries pillion rider without a helmet in contravention of provisions as enumerated under relevant sections of the Motor Vehicles Act,” the order read.In July 2016, the city police, following Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressing her displeasure over motorcyclists not wearing helmets, had imposed similar “no helmet no petrol” rule forbidding petrol pumps from selling fuel to motorcyclists without helmets.

05-12-2020||New Delhi||Canada opposes MSP, has scarce interest in well-being of Indian farmers: BJP||The BJP on Saturday slammed Canada's stand on farmers' protests in India as "nothing but hypocrisy", saying it is a strident critic of minimum support price and other agricultural policies at the WTO, and often questions India's domestic agricultural measures, including food and livelihood security."It (Canada) also opposes import restrictions to protect India's farmers. The questions posed by Canada to India regarding India's agri policies in WTO are evidence of the fact that Canada has scarce interest in the genuine well-being of Indian farmers and agriculture producers," BJP's foreign affairs department in-charge Vijay Chauthaiwale tweeted.Canada's criticism of India on farmer's issues is nothing but hypocrisy. Canada is strident critic of MSP and other agriculture policies at the WTO, and often questions India’s domestic agriculture measures including food and livelihood security @JustinTrudeau @nadirypatelCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had recently backed the agitating farmers in India, saying his country will always be there to defend the rights of peaceful protests. He had expressed concern over the situation.Reacting strongly, India on Friday summoned Canadian High Commissioner Nadir Patel and told him that the comments made by Trudeau and others in his cabinet on the protests were an "unacceptable interference" in the country's internal affairs and these actions, if continued, will have a "seriously damaging" impact on bilateral ties.In a series of tweets tagging Trudeau and Patel, Chauthaiwale said, "Canada's criticism of India on farmer's issues is nothing but hypocrisy. Canada is strident critic of MSP and other agriculture policies at the WTO, and often questions India's domestic agriculture measures including food and livelihood security."  Noting that Canada is a member of the Cairns Group of agri exporters, he said the body's objective in WTO negotiations is to seek increased market access in countries like India.It also seeks reduction in the agri subsidies provided to domestic producers, even if such subsidies are subsistence-level, he said."It also opposes import restrictions to protect India's farmers. The questions posed by Canada to India regarding India's agri policies in WTO are evidence of the fact that Canada has scarce interest in the genuine well-being of Indian farmers and agriculture producers," the BJP leader said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given topmost priority to enhance farmers' income by increasing minimum support price, giving better access to technology and providing adequate insurance cover for agri products against natural calamities, he said, adding that "Unfortunately, Canada has refused to acknowledge it".

"Unfortunately, the video couldn't be provided in time in the required format," General Assembly spokesman Brenden Varma told IANS.Varma did not provide details on the required format or whether the video arrived and when.Poonawallah, however, seemed all set for the play-out. "It will be my honour and privilege tonight, to address over a hundred world leaders and nations at the UN special session on COVID19, highlighting India's crucial role and contribution in fighting this unprecedented global pandemic," he had tweeted.Poonawalla's remarks were to follow after a global state-of-play summary by Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, and a panel featuring BioNTech CEO Prof Ugur Sahin, Dr Ozlem Tureci and Prof. Sarah Gilbert from the Oxford University/AstraZeneca trial.The United Nations General Assembly took more than nine months to put together this special two-day session on Covid-19 featuring the world's leading scientists and collaborative vaccine efforts.Poonawalla's Serum Institute of India (SII) is mass manufacturing the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and hopes to file for an emergency authorization within weeks.After a 28 November visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the company's headquarters in Pune, Poonawalla said he expects the Indian government to buy 300 million to 400 million doses of 'Covishield' by July 2021.AstraZeneca reported that its vaccine was, on average, 70 per cent effective at preventing Covid-19 illness. About 3,000 participants were given the half dose and then a full dose four weeks later, and this provided the best efficacy in the trial - around 90 per cent. In the larger group of nearly 9,000 volunteers, who were given two full doses four weeks apart, efficacy was 62 per cent.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/citing-tech-issues-un-covid-summit-nixes-adar-poonawalla-video-180332

05-12-2020||Singapore||Singapore daily names Poonawalla of Serum Institute, 5 others Asians of the Year||Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive of the world's largest vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India, is among six people named ‘Asians of the Year’ by Singapore's leading daily, The Straits Times, for their work in fighting the Covid pandemic.Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has collaborated with the University of Oxford and the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for making the Covid vaccine, ‘Covidshield’, and is conducting trials in India.The other five named in the list are Chinese researcher Zhang Yongzhen, who led the team that mapped and published online the first complete genome of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that sparked the pandemic, China's Major-General Chen Wei, Japan's Dr Ryuichi Morishita and Singapore's Professor Ooi Eng Eong, who are among those at the forefront of developing vaccines against the virus, and South Korean businessman Seo Jung-jin whose company will enable the making and dispensing of the vaccines and other Covid-19 treatments to the world.Collectively referred to as "the virus busters", they are heroes of a kind, having devoted themselves to the pressing cause of resolving the coronavirus pandemic, each in their own capacity, the daily said."Sars-CoV-2, the virus that has brought death and hardship to the world's largest and most populous continent, is meeting its tamer in The Virus Busters," the award citation said."We salute your courage, care, commitment and creativity. In this peril-filled hour, you are a symbol of hope for Asia, indeed the world."The Serum Institute was founded by Poonawalla's father Cyrus Poonawalla in 1966.Poonawalla joined the Serum Institute of India in 2001 and became the CEO of Serum Institute with complete control of the day-to-day operations of the company in 2011.Poonawalla said that he had put USD 250 million of his family fortune into ramping up his institute's manufacturing capacity."I decided to go all out," said Poonawalla, 39, who has pledged that his firm's COVID-19 vaccines will help supply lower- and middle-income countries that face significant disadvantages in the quest to obtain them.Poonawalla said his institute is helping poorer countries level up in access to vaccines.In the big picture of ending the pandemic, commonality of purpose is key, said The Straits Times, Singapore's mainstream daily.The Straits Times Asians of the Year have led the way, as have scores of other individuals in their own fields. When an end comes into sight, it will be due in no small part to these people who - undaunted by the tumult - have committed themselves to the sobering, much-needed work to put together an exit plan from the crisis, for humanity."There has not been a day this year when the pandemic has not been in the news. Straits Times' editors felt there could be no more deserving recipients this year than the people squaring up to Asia's biggest-ever health challenge, engaged in pioneering and courageous efforts to prevent the highly contagious virus from wreaking more damage,” Bhagyashree Garekar, Straits Times' foreign editor, said on Saturday."In a year that is ending with a wish for great resets... Asia's virus busters are the face of hope on the horizon," said Garekar.Between them, the recipients of the 2020 award capture the entire trajectory of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.In deciding to honour The Virus Busters, Straits Times editors had in mind those who have, in one way or another, enabled the complex, multi-stage process of preventing as many people around the world from getting the deadly disease in as little time as possible."Each year, ST editors seek out a person, team or organisation that has not only made or shaped the news, but also helped contribute positively to Asia in the process,” said Warren Fernandez, editor-in-chief of Singapore Press Holdings' English/Malay/Tamil Media Group and editor of Straits Times."This year, we naturally looked to those involved in the fight against Covid-19, which has dominated the headlines. We debated long and hard, but finally agreed on a group of people who have done the most to help find an answer to the crisis brought on by the virus."They are a disparate group whose collective efforts have pushed forward the search for vaccines, allowing these to be discovered and delivered with an urgency never attempted or seen before. Their commitment and actions have helped save lives and give hope to people all around Asia, and the world," Fernandez said.

Also, strategy planning will be under the same official.The Director General Military Operations (DGMO), Director General Military Intelligence (DGMI), DG Operational Logistics, DG Strategy Planning and the newly created post of DG Information Warfare (DGIW) will be under the Deputy Chief Strategy.The DGIW will have the media outreach wing under him that includes tackling misinformation of social media and timing release of information, pictures and videos to the media — newspapers, TV and websites.At present, each of these DG’s reported separately to the Vice Chief of the Indian Army, who is burdened with multiple issues and it created communication gaps in smooth functioning. The day-to-day operations of the entire Army are managed by the Vice Chief and that includes coordination with the Ministry of Defence.This is the third post of the Deputy Chief of the Indian Army and by far the most important as it will deal with operations, intelligence, information and logistics.

05-12-2020||Roopinder Singh||Narinder Singh Kapany: Scientist, Entrepreneur, Philanthropist||Apioneering scientist, teacher, entrepreneur, businessman, patron of arts and philanthropist, Moga-born Narinder Singh Kapany was truly multi-faceted. The “father of fibre optics” turned his research into a thriving business, and in the process revolutionised communication and helped provide the underpinnings of the Internet infrastructure of today. He was also a major patron of Sikh arts and sponsored many activities through the Sikh Foundation that he founded.Born on October 31, 1926, the man who rubbed shoulders with a veritable who’s who of world leaders, presidents, prime ministers and princes, Dr Kapany passed away on December 4, 2020. For “Fortune” magazine, in 1999, he was among the “Unsung Heroes of the 20th century”, who, many contend, had a stronger claim than Charles Kao, who got the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.As a youngster, he grew up in Dehradun. He earned the BSc degree from Agra University and then went to the UK for advanced studies in optics at the Imperial College of Science in London. There he researched and successfully published a paper on transmitting images through optical fibre bundles in “Nature” in 1954. The same year he married Satinder Kaur in London.The couple moved to the US in 1955, where Dr Kapany taught at the University of Rochester. He established Optics Technology in 1960 at Palo Alto, California. The west coast was to be his home henceforth, as he devoted his time to teaching — University of California (UC) Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, and Stanford University — and to his business, going on to founding Kaptron (1973) and K2 Optronics (2000). I remember his laughing and saying that one must be modest when I asked him why he had named his company after the second highest peak in the world.The Kapany family home welcomed Punjabis. However, the back-to-the-roots yearning took a concrete form with the establishment of the Sikh Foundation in 1967.In 1997, he set up the Kundan Kaur Kapany Chair of Sikh Studies at the University of California at Santa Barbara in the memory of his mother. In 1999, he endowed a Chair of Opto-Electronics at the University of California, Santa Cruz.He led the commemoration of the Tercentenary of the Khalsa with the international “Sikh arts exhibit” at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London, which was inaugurated by Prince Charles on March 22, 1999.He lost his wife Satinder in 2016.Dr Narinder Singh Kapany is survived by his son Raj Kapany and daughter Kiran Kaur Kapany and his grandchildren. His family, foundation and endowed chairs will now have the challenge of shaping his legacy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/narinder-singh-kapany-scientist-entrepreneur-philanthropist-180142
05-12-2020||New Delhi||Vaccine ready in a few weeks: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said a Covid-19 vaccine was expected to be available in the next few weeks. The inoculation drive, he said, would begin as soon as scientists granted the necessary approvals.“Experts believe we will not have to wait long now to get a Covid vaccine. It will be ready in the next few weeks. As soon as we get a green signal from the scientists, the vaccination drive will start. The Centre is working with states to determine priority groups for vaccination,” the PM said.

05-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||Call for Bharat bandh on December 8||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 4A day prior to the scheduled meeting with the Centre, farmers’ unions on Friday gave a call for a “Bharat bandh” on December 8. The agitating farmers will burn effigies of the Modi government and some corporate houses on Saturday even while talks between their representatives and Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar regarding the three contentious farm laws are underway.The farm leaders have reportedly decided to sit through the meeting only if the Centre agrees to repeal the laws and guarantees MSP (minimum support price) for all 23 crops. The farmers also plan to gherao toll plazas. While the Modi government appears willing to make some amendments to the laws and give a written assurance on the MSP, it is unlikely to agree to a rollback. It remains to be seen how much the government is willing to concede to buy peace. The Modi government had in 2015 made a U-turn, agreeing to drop amendments to the Land Acquisition Act. 2013.Hooda plans no-trust motion against govtHaryana LoP Bhupinder Singh Hooda has said the Congress would seek a special Assembly session and bring in a no-confidence motion against Manohar Lal Khattar government. TNSSources say ministers and officials are holding talks, including with those in the Law Ministry, to find a “middle path”. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the mandi system would not be weakened, adding: “We are making an honest attempt to placate the farmers and resolve the issue.”The farm leaders say the government has only two options — to repeal the laws or use force against them. “It is time to take a decision. We need a guarantee on the MSP,” one of them said. Activists Yudhvir Singh, Harvinder Singh Lakhowal, Hannan Mollah and Buta Singh Shadipur made it clear that “minor” amendments would not work and neither would the government’s “divide and rule” policy.EX-coach threatens to return awardFormer boxing coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu, during whose tenure India secured maiden Olympic medal in the sport, has said he will return his Dronacharya award if farmers’ demands were not met.

The government has viewed these comments as having encouraged gatherings of extremist activities in front of the Indian High Commission and Consulates in Canada that raise issues of safety and security.“We expect the Canadian government to ensure the fullest security of Indian envoys and its political leaders to refrain from pronouncements that legitimise extremist activism,” said a MEA note.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/demarche-over-trudeau-remarks-180192
