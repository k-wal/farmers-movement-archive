01-11-2020||New Delhi||Cong hits out at govt over rise in prices of essential commodities||The Congress on Sunday attacked the government over the rise in prices of essential commodities, asking it to act sternly against black marketeers and push sufficient stocks of food in the market to check rising prices.Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh accused the government of being ignorant and alleged it was allowing stocks to rot and the people to suffer.He said the festive season is here but it is not only COVID-19 that is denting the spirits of the common man as the prices of food items are spiralling.He claimed that with almost no fiscal stimulus, the economy is struggling to get back on track, but “the government is ignorant and blatantly incompetent in controlling inflation”.Vallabh said while the government should be exploring avenues to provide support to the people and boost consumption, it is on a lookout to “extract as much from the common man and leave them helpless”.“We demand that the government immediately act on black marketeers, assess stock of essential items lying in cold storages and push sufficient stock in the markets to control the prices,” he told reporters.The Congress leader cited the high prices of onions and potato, saying it is highest in 10 years. He said the consumer food price inflation has been consistently high for the last few months, both in the urban and rural areas.The overall CFPI (Consumer Food Price Index) was over 9 per cent for July 2020 and August 2020, but it breached the 10 per cent-mark in September 2020, he said, adding that the inflation rate for vegetables in September 2020 was 22.71 per cent and for pulses and products it was 13.69 per cent.“What was the government doing to control all of this? By the looks of it, nothing. The government’s incompetence and inaction is evident from the fact that while we exported 1.23 lakh tonnes of potatoes to nations like Saudi Arabia, Oman, Myanmar and others in 2019-20, we ourselves have a supply shortage,” he said.“Why was no proper planning done before exporting our potato stock when there is a supply crunch in our domestic market,” he asked.Vallabh said there are 30 lakh tonnes of potatoes lying in cold storages across Uttar Pradesh, out of which 22 lakh tonnes was meant for the markets.“When the time is to boost consumption in our economy, why is the government denting the pockets of the common man through increased prices for their mandatory spending,” he also asked. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-hits-out-at-govt-over-rise-in-prices-of-essential-commodities-164459

Bobde, and comprising Justice A.S. Bopanna and Justice V. Ramasubramanian, said it is convinced that steps have been taken by the state government to make adequate arrangement for security to the victim's family and witnesses."However, in a matter of the present nature it is necessary to address the normal perception and pessimism which cannot be said as being without justification," the bench said."In that view, without casting any aspersions on the security personnel of the state police; in order to allay all apprehensions and only as a confidence building measure, we find it appropriate to direct that the security to the victim's family and the witnesses shall be provided by the CRPF within a week from today," the order said.The 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital during treatment. The victim was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on September 30.Her family alleged they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites. Local police officers, however, said the cremation was carried out "as per the wishes of the family".The apex court also said all the aspects of the case, including monitoring of the probe and providing security to the victim's family as well as the witnesses, would be considered by the Allahabad High Court.A bench headed by Chief Justice Bobde said that plea for transfer of trial out of Uttar Pradesh in the case would be considered later after the CBI probe was completed. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/80-crpf-men-deployed-to-guard-hathras-victims-family-164454

Ayaz Sadiq.”The PML-N has strongly reacted to the move blaming the PTI government for ‘awarding traitor certificates’ to its political opponents.PML-N Punjab information secretary lawmaker Azma Bokhari said the one who put up “traitor” posters of Sadiq must be having a criminal record like in the past cases registered against the PML-N leadership.The 37-year-old Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27 after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets during aerial combat.In the early hours of February 26, 2019, the IAF jets bombed the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror camps in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan and avenged the Pulwama terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel.Before his jet was hit, Abhinandan downed an F-16 fighter of Pakistan. He was released on the night of March 1 by Pakistan.In a speech in the National Assembly, Sadiq said that Prime Minister Imran Khan skipped the high-level meeting, which was attended by top leadership, including Army chief Gen Bajwa and Foreign Minister Qureshi. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abhinandan-remarks-pak-considers-registering-treason-case-against-pml-n-leader-164448

Haan, Kamal Nath ji, main kutta hoon (Yes, I am a dog) because the public is my master. Yes, I am a dog, because a dog protects its master,” he said.Meanwhile, in an interesting slip of the tongue, Scindia also asked people to vote for his former party Congress. In the video that went viral on the social medai, Scindia can be heard saying, “My people of Dabra, raise your hand and make your fist to convince (state chief minister) Shivraj Singh and me, make us believe that you will press the ‘hand’ button on November 3”. However, he immediately corrected his sentence, appealing for votes for “kamal” the symbol of the saffron party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/campaigning-ends-for-by-polls-including-in-mp-164444

The UTs of J&K and Ladakh, including the area of so-called ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’, are an integral part of India by virtue of the legal, complete and irrevocable accession of J&K to the Union of India in 1947,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava in response to a media query on the Pakistan PM’s observations.Srivastava said such attempts by Pakistan were intended to camouflage its illegal occupation. But it cannot hide the Pakistan state’s human rights violations, exploitation and denial of freedom for over 70 years to the people living in these “Pakistan occupied territories’’.The MEA advised Pakistan to immediately vacate these territories instead of seeking to alter their status.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vacate-gilgit-baltistan-instead-of-altering-status-mea-to-pakistan-164442

He said it was his dream to change the lives of the Telugu people radically by taking village as a unit.The Chief Minister said: “Every village with a population of 2,000 has been provided with a village secretariat where at least 12 volunteers work relentlessly, with each volunteer catering to the needs of 50 families through door delivery of welfare schemes. The government has taken the initiative to revamp government schools on par with the private schools under the Nadu-Nedu scheme and offer English medium education to all students. The government has also been establishing health clinics in every village for their healthcare with 51 types of medicines.”The Chief Minister said he was proud to say that all these amenities were being provided all over the state without any room for corruption for the past 17 months and without any discrimination of caste, creed or gender.However, it was unfortunate that some unscrupulous forces in the state, who were jealous of the government’s good performance, were out to resort to mud-slinging, he added.Earlier, Reddy hoisted the national flag and offered floral tributes to Potti Sriramulu and Telugu Thalli, and received the guard of honour on the occasion of Andhra Pradesh Formation Day.Minister for Endowments Vellampalli Srinivas, MP Nadigam Suresh, Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney, Director General of Police Gautam Sawang, Government Adviser (public affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, Government Advisor(communications) GVD Krishna Mohan were among those present at the occasion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/state-determined-to-forge-ahead-andhra-pradesh-cm-on-formation-day-164432
01-11-2020||K V Prasad ||Cong-CPM tango in West Bengal, bringing existing understanding out in the open||Tribune News Service New Delhi, November 1 The decision of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to have an electoral understanding with the Indian National Congress for the 2021 West Bengal assembly elections brings out in the open the not so secret understanding that existed in the state four years ago. Yet, that understanding pursued by the Bengal unit of the party with tacit approval of the party general secretary Sitaram Yechury was frowned upon by the collective CPM leadership on an understanding with the Indian National Congress and splitting the party down the middle with predominant Kerala comrades vociferously opposing any such plan. Now with the polls less than a year away CPM Central Committee on Saturday endorsed the understanding, reconciled as it is the face of double-headed challenge in the form of ruling Trinamool Congress and growing political spread of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Kerala, which will elect a new assembly around the same time, will be an exception with the CPM-led Left Democratic Front currently in government gearing up take on the Congress-led United Democratic Front.  Three years ago CPM comrades from Kerala vetoed any understanding with the Congress but altering political landscape both in the state and West Bengal dictated a change of strategy. The assessment in West Bengal unit is that in order to check the sharp rise of BJP, parties opposed to the BJP and Trinamool should join hands. The 2016 assembly experiment of tacit understanding between the CPM and the Congress did not throw up results on anticipated lines. The combined vote share of the Left parties was around 26 per cent winning 32 seats, much less than 44 seats the Congress bagged with a vote share of 40 per cent. In fact, ahead of the last party congress and 2019 general elections, the CPM general secretary came under attack with comrades from Kerala voting against an alternate draft resolution articulating Yechury’s interpretation that as a classical Marxist, the party will have to arrive at “concrete analysis based on concrete conditions”.  As for Kerala, he maintained that voters in the state are discerning to decipher the political compulsions in taking on the Congress in the Southern State and adopting a friendly posture in West Bengal.  The ongoing Bihar assembly elections are in a manner a test-bed for a broader alliance of parties opposed to the BJP and its allies. Besides West Bengal, a similar exercise will come into play in the assembly elections to Assam and Tamil Nadu where the CPM will join parties opposed to the BJP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-cpm-tango-in-west-bengal-bringing-existing-understanding-out-in-the-open-164431

The movement of traffic was disrupted on the Bayana-Hindaun road,” police said.Earlier on Saturday, Gurjar leader Himmat Singh said the talks with the government were positive.Bainsla had asked the members of the community to reach Pilupura in Bayana of Sawai Madhopur district on November 1 to start an agitation on reservation-related issues.Mobile Internet services have been suspended in many districts. The home department had evoked the National Security Act (NSA) in Bharatpur, Dholpur, Sawai Madhopur, Dausa, Tonk, Bundi, Jhalawar and Karauli districts.The organisation is demanding that the Rajasthan government should get the Gurjar reservation included in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, fill the backlog of vacancies and give the benefit of five per cent reservation to the Most Backward Classes (MBCs) in the pending recruitment process.The 14-point agreement includes providing a regular pay scale to 1,252 MBC candidates who have completed their probation period.The state government will once again write to the Centre to include the provision related to reservation for the MBCs in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, as per the agreement.Meanwhile, families of the three people who died due to injuries received during a Gurjar agitation in the past will be given an assistance of Rs 5 lakh each.

It will go through the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, one of the world’s most geologically active areas, a report by the state-run China News reported.The Sichuan-Tibet Railway starts from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, and travels through Ya’an and enters Tibet via Qamdo, shortening the journey from Chengdu to Lhasa from 48 hours to 13 hours, the report said.Linzhi, which is also known as Nyingchi, is located close to Arunachal Pradesh border.China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.Linzhi also has an airport, one of the five built by China in the Himalayan region.The newly-built Ya’an-Linzhi section runs 1,011 kilometres and includes 26 stations. Trains are expected to run at speeds between 120 and 200 km per hour, a staffer in charge of the project said.The total cost of the entire Sichuan-Tibet Railway project is around 319.8 billion yuan (USD 47.8 billion), Global Times reported.The Sichuan-Tibet railway is also of great significance in safeguarding national unity and maintaining border stability, the daily quoted Chinese experts as saying.“After the Sichuan-Tibet railway starts operation, Tibet will have more exchanges with other parts of the Chinese mainland. Strategically, China’s Tibetan region will have much stronger capabilities in material transportation and logistical supplies,” Lin Minwang, deputy director at the Center for South Asian Studies at Fudan University, said.Qian Feng, director of the research department at the National Strategy Institute at Tsinghua University told the daily “If a scenario of a crisis happens at the China-India border, the railway will provide a great convenience for China’s delivery of strategic materials.”The Sichuan-Tibet Railway will not only accelerate and enhance the overall economic development of the Tibet region but will play an important role in safeguarding border stability, the daily’s report said.The construction of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway is of strategic importance that benefits the overall development of Tibet, Xiong Kunxin, an ethnic studies professor at the Tibet University in Lhasa, said.As a major infrastructure project, the railway is set to improve transport that has hindered exchanges between the Tibet region and the rest of China, and could help transport advanced equipment and technologies from other places to Tibet, and bring local products out, Xiong said.Observers said the new railway line will put Tibet on a “fast track” to catch up with other more developed regions of China, the reports said.Both Sichuan and Tibet are rich in resources with their unique natural landscapes, huge mineral reserves, and a wide variety of medicinal herbs.After the completion of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, it is expected to greatly boost local tourism all along the line, it said.“It will also enhance person-to-person exchanges between different regions and ethnic groups, promote understanding and cultural integration,” Xiong said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-to-begin-construction-of-yaan-linzhi-section-of-sichuan-tibet-railway-close-to-indias-border-164421
01-11-2020||Mumbai||Mukesh Khanna says #MeToo remarks wrongly presented: My career testimony to how much I respect women||Veteran actor Mukesh Khanna has issued a statement clarifying his remarks on the #MeToo movement, which led to outrage on social media, saying that his comments were presented in a “wrong manner”.According to a video clip from an interview given to a news channel, Khanna claimed that #MeToo happened because women tried “walking shoulder to shoulder with men”.Responding to the criticism from social media users, the 62-year-old actor released a statement on Instagram Saturday, saying he was being made to look “anti-women”.“I respect women and I’m concerned regarding their safety. Some people have created a lot of noise out of a clipping from my interview. I never said that women shouldn’t work... In that video, I was merely throwing light on the difficulties women face when they step out to work... But I never said that MeToo happens when women go out,” the actor wrote.As I said let me show you my full interview taken by someone from which this “ Vivadit Bayan” has been taken to malign me that I mean “ This”which I don’t mean. I was just commenting on how Me too can happen. You can see yourself in this interview how I respect women.A post shared by  Mukesh Khanna (@iammukeshkhanna) on Oct 31, 2020 at 9:24am PDT  The #MeToo movement started in Hollywood in 2017 after many women from the entertainment industry called out various powerful men for sexually harassing them, drawing focus on the workplace safety.A year later, it gathered momentum in Bollywood when actor Tanushree Dutta accused Nana Patekar of sexual harassment. Following this, many women in the Indian film industry came out to speak against the culture of toxic work environment.Khanna, best known for playing titular superhero in TV series “Shaktimaan” and Bhishma Pitamaha in “Mahabharata”, said he had also expressed his concern over women’s safety in workplace a year ago in a video message.The actor wrote his career of four decades was a reflection of his respect for women.“I just want to request all my friends and well-wishers to not present my statement in a wrong manner. My career of forty years is a testimony to how much I respect women.

01-11-2020||Patna||Campaign ends for second phase of Bihar elections||Campaigning for the second phase of Bihar assembly elections ended on Sunday evening, setting the stage for polling on Tuesday in 94 constituencies spread across 17 districts.The last day of campaigning witnessed hectic canvassing with Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressing four back-to-back rallies in support of NDA candidates, and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, who is also in the fray in this phase, crisscrossing over a dozen venues.According to the Election Commission, more than 2.85 crore voters will decide the electoral fate of 1,463 candidates — 1316 male, 146 female and one transgender.Of the total 2,85,50,285 voters 1,50,33,034 are male, 1,35,16,271 female and 980 transgenders, as per the poll panel data.The Election Commission has said it has set up a total of 41,362 booths at 18,823 polling stations. Maharajganj constituency has the maximum of 27 candidates in this phase, while the minimum four are from Darauli constituency (SC).The 94 constituencies which are going to poll on November 3 are in 17 districts: West Champaran, East Champaran, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Madhubani, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Gopalganj, Siwan, Saran, Vaishali, Samastipur, Begusarai, Khagaria, Bhagalpur, Nalanda and Patna.The BJP’s charge was led by Prime Minister Modi, who addressed seven rallies over two days, including the four on Sunday.Several Union Ministers, including Rajnath Singh, Smriti Irani, Giriraj Singh and Anurag Thakur, besides senior party leaders such as BJP chief JP Nadda, addressed campaign rallies.In his Sunday rallies, the prime minister excoriated the opposition over the Pulwama attack after Pakistan’s admission of complicity in it and berated the RJD-Congress combine, calling it an alliance of “double-double yuvraj” (two crown princes) whose sole concern was to protect their “respective thrones”.BJP leaders repeatedly raked up the Ram temple issues, Article 370, triple talaq and also prominently mentioned the Pakistani minister’s admission of his country’s involvement in the Pulwama attack of 2019 that had left 40 CRPF jawans dead.For attacking the RJD, their constant refrain was “jungle raj”, “lantern era”, “kidnapping industry”, slamming the party over its record on law and order.At a rally on October 28, PM Modi had targeted Tejashwi, calling him “Jungle Raj Ke Yuvraj (the crown prince of jungle raj)”.Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi addressed two rallies for this phase of elections where he cornered Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over the issues of unemployment, migrant crisis, farm laws and sugar mills.He had said the Prime Minister talked about other countries in his speeches but not about the issues facing the nation such as unemployment.Tejashwi, in the meanwhile, scaled up the intensity of his campaign and addressed close to a dozen, or even more, rallies every day since the voting for phase 1 of election on October 28.He kept his focus on his promise of 10 lakh jobs while also assailing Kumar over a record “46.6 per cent unemployment”, poor status of education and health facilities, the handling of the coronavirus crisis among other things.Tejashwi’s salvos drew stinging response from Kumar who tried to blunt his attack by comparing the law and order situation under the RJD’s government (1990-2005) with that under his 15 rule and constantly reminding the voter that RJD chief Lalu Yadav has been implicated for corruption and is serving a jail term.Kumar also kept counting his government’s work on power, road and giving reservation to women in local bodies.He also said that he would prefer population-proportionate reservation.With massive crowds thronging these rallies, COVID- 19 guidelines on social distancing were flagrantly violated.Tejashwi’s elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav is also in the fray in this phase.Among other prominent faces whose fate would be closed in EVMs in this phase are: BJP leader and Road Construction Minister Nand Kishore Yadav (Patna Sahib), JD(U) lawmaker and Rural Development Minister Shrawan Kumar (Nalanda), BJP MLA and Cooperative Minister Rana Randhir Singh (Madhuban), and JD(U) leader and state minister Ramsevak Singh (Hathua).Also in the fray is Chandrika Roy (JDU), the father of Tej Pratap Yadavs estranged wife Aishwarya Rai, who in her campaign has been highlighting the alleged “ill-treatment” meted out to her by RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s family.This phase is also very crucial for Chirag Paswan- led Lok Janshakti Party which has fielded 52 candidates.Their performance in this phase will indicate if the issues raised by Paswan during his campaign — corruption charges against Nitish Kumar, education degrees getting delayed, lack of jobs, and migration for livelihood — found resonance among the people.The RJD has 56 candidates in the fray this phase, the BJP 46, the JD(U) 43, the RLSP 36 and the Congress 24.Congress leader Shatrughan Sinha’s son Luv Sinha is also in the fray this phase from Bankipur seat in Patna. He is up against sitting BJP MLA Nitin Nabin.Haranut (Nalanda) constituency, which houses Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s village, is also going to vote in this phase.Voting will begin at 7 am on November 3.The third and final round of voting will take place on November 7 and the counting of votes on November 10.

01-11-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM writes to Nadda over suspension of goods trains||Expressing concern over the continued suspension of goods trains even after easing of the blockade by farmers, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday wrote an open letter to BJP national president J.P. Nadda, calling for “collective will and statesmanship to resolve the festering imbroglio that could have dangerous consequences not just for the state but the entire nation”.Responding with pain and anguish to several recent statements and comments of various BJP national and Punjab leaders on the farmers’ protests, particularly the continued suspension of goods trains by the railways, the Chief Minister stressed that “this was neither the time nor the occasion to indulge in political confrontation or allegations or counter allegations”.“What is needed at this critical moment is for all of us to put aside any temptations we may be harbouring to promote our political interests,” he said, adding that it is, on the contrary, “time for all of us to rise above political considerations and to respond as statesmen, to a situation that threatens to spiral irrevocable out of control, if immediate steps are not taken to stem the tide”.Citing the repercussions of the continued suspension of goods trains services would have for national security, in addition to the critical shortages faced not just by Punjab but also Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh, the Chief Minister warned that the armed forces were likely to be badly affected with the onset of winter, as they could run out of supplies and other requisites once the snowfall blocks the roads to Ladakh and the Kashmir Valley.“These are dangers that neither the Central government nor any political party, including the BJP, can choose to ignore,” he said, adding “the onus lies on all of us. We need to all liaise together, with the common goal of solving  the contentious issue, in the interest of the country”.Referring to the losses caused in Punjab due to the prolonged blockade, Amarinder Singh said every day of the continued suspension of goods trains meant critical losses to the industry, agriculture and overall economy, in view  of critical shortages of power, urea and DAP stocks.As for the consequences for the national security, he noted that if the armed forces are deprived of critical supplies, amid the increasingly aggressive overtures from both China and Pakistan, the situation could become extremely dangerous for the country.Even Punjab could become more vulnerable to security threats from Pakistan, if the current crisis around the farmers is not resolved at the earliest, he warned, noting that ISI-backed terror groups were perpetually looking at exploiting any unrest in Punjab.The Chief Minister termed as distressing recent remarks of various BJP leaders to the prevailing crisis situation, taking specific note of the statements of BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh and Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma.The Chief Minister expressed surprise over the reason of “uncertainty and safety of train operations’ cited by the Railways to not allow goods trains’ movement through Punjab despite the easing of blockade by farmers. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-cm-writes-to-nadda-over-suspension-of-goods-trains-164410
01-11-2020||Manali||Army officer, fellow set record by pedalling across Himalayas||An Indian Army officer and his fellow have made their way into the Guinness World Records by covering the arduous 427-km long rugged and inhospitable terrains of Himalayas from Leh to Manali by paddling on their cycles by braving harsh climatic conditions with snowfall, extremely low oxygen and temperature.Col Vishal Ahlawat and Sepoy Ravi Kumar of the Corps of Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME Corps) made a world record by covering this stretch in record 31 hours and 45 minutes on one of the toughest mountain bike expeditions in the world.The challenge was to finish the expedition in 40 hours to make it into the Guinness World Records.After crossing three high mountain passes in the cold deserts of Himachal and Jammu and Kashmir—Tanglangla Pass (17,480 ft), Lachungla Pass (16,620 ft) and Baralacha Pass (16,020 ft) -- they reached the picturesque resort of Manali on October 31 at 11.15 p.m.The duo started their journey from Leh at 3.30 p.m. on October 30. They were riding Trek Sports V bikes.They avoided the Rohtang Pass (13,050 ft) and used the 9.2-km-long Atal Tunnel, beneath the majestic pass, to reach here.“We started our expedition from Leh late in the afternoon as we wanted to cross the treacherous Baralacha Pass in the morning. Though the height of Baralacha Pass is slightly less compared to two other passes, it normally receives heavy spells of snow. So we decided to cross it in the day time,” Col Ahlawat, 44, who scaled the Mt Everest in 2016, told IANS.He said this was for the first time he cycled while snowing.“We were expecting to encounter high velocity icy winds while crossing the passes. But the onset of snowfall has subdued the wind velocity. Secondly, the movement of trucks and heavy vehicles was halted by local authorities owing to onset of snowfall,” he explained.He said they oxygen deprivation while crossing Tanglangla Pass and Paang.“In fact, it is my mountaineering experience that really helped me battling the nerve and selecting the clothing and logistics amidst the challenging mountains,” he said.He said this kind of expedition was a good beginning and a lot of lessons were learnt.For this officer, who has created a national record in 2007 for cycling from Leh to Kanyakumari in 18 days 17 hours and 35 minutes, no terrain is tough.“The toughest terrain is that in which you fail to protect your vehicle from certain break down and harm yourself too. For the first time we were travelling on the snow-laden, slippery mountainous stretch. With patience and presence of mind, we decided to cross the Baralacha Pass at an extremely slow speed. At slightly high speed, there were chances of slips. At that time, the temperature hovers between minus 10-15 degree Celsius and the water we were carrying in bottles was frozen,” Col Ahlawat said.He has also created a world record for the longest journey in a single country on bicycle by covering 25,337 km in 107 days, 23 hours, 34 minutes.A technical team of five soldiers was accompanying both the riders in a vehicle during the expedition.“All expedition really tests one’s nerves, patience and determination. Surviving in extreme cold with low oxygen plus treacherous terrain in high mountain passes is really challenging for a biker,” he said.The strategic Manali-Leh road reopens for vehicular traffic every year in the first week of June after remaining closed for over six months due to heavy snowfall.The non-stop journey in a four-wheeler between Manali and Leh takes 16-18 hours.Backpackers descend in Manali from August to September every year. Most of them prefer to drive down the Manali-Leh highway. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-officer-fellow-set-record-by-pedalling-across-himalayas-164408
01-11-2020||Mumbai||Belgaum dispute: Maharashtra ministers sport black ribbons||Maharashtra cabinet ministers on   Sunday sported black ribbons to express solidarity with Belgaum’s Marathi-speaking people who observe the foundation day of Karnataka on November 1 as ‘black day’.Maharashtra claims Belgaum, part of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency, but currently a district of Karnataka, on linguistic grounds.The dispute between the two states over Belgaum and other border areas is pending before the Supreme Court for many years.Maharashtra Water Resources Minister and state NCP president Jayant Patil on Sunday sported a black ribbon on his arm while performing his official duties.State Urban Development Minister and Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde released black balloons in neighbouring Thane.Patil said NCP workers and all ministers in the state government were sporting black ribbons to express solidarity with their brethren in the boundary areas. “Atrocities against Marathi-speaking people by Karnataka are continuing even though the case is pending in the Supreme Court,” Patil alleged while expressing confidence that Belgaum and other border areas comprising Marathi- speaking people will be part of Maharashtra.Eknath Shinde and minister Chhagan Bhujbal in a letter to Marathi people of Karnataka said the Maharashtra government is committed towards the education, social justice, conservation of Marathi language and other issues of people in Belgaum, Karwar, Nipani, Bidar and other Marathi-speaking areas along the border.The two ministers were last year appointed as co- coordinators to oversee the Maharashtra government’s efforts to expedite the case related to the boundary dispute. “We both are small soldiers of this movement to include these areas into Maharashtra which is indebted to the sacrifice and courage of the local Marathi population,” they said in the letter.Maharashtra considers everyone in the border areas who speaks Marathi irrespective of his/her caste, creed and religion as its own, the ministers said. “We consider providing them representation and involvement in social, cultural and political field as very important and will take policy decisions from time-to-time,” they said. “The inclusion of the Marathi-speaking areas into Maharashtra will be a dream come true for the 12 crore population in the state,” they said. “Till that historic moment turns into a reality, Maharashtra would continue to remain in solidarity with the Marathi-speaking people in the border areas,” they added.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut told reporters that the demand for inclusion of the Marathi-speaking areas of Karnataka into Maharashtra was a fight for the rights of people living along the border areas of the two states.“The 60-year-old fight was for the rights of the Marathi-speaking people living in Belgaum and other areas along the Karnataka-Maharashtra border. We need not be told that the sun and moon will continue to exist,” he said. “This 60-year-old fight is the right of the Marathi people. Their wish to be part of Maharashtra should be respected. If the Kannada-speaking people on Karnataka-Andhra or Kerala borders wish to be part of Karnataka, their wishes, too, should be fulfilled,” he said.Raut was responding to a reported statement of Karnataka’s Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi that Belgaum will continue to be a part of Karnataka till the sun and moon exist.Maharashtra Congress minister Satej Patil in a tweet in Marathi said, “Let people say anything they want. We have decided. Sanyukta Maharashtra (United Maharashtra) will be a reality with the inclusion of Belgaum.”State Rural Development Minister Hasan Mushrif tweeted that the state cabinet ministers were sporting black ribbons and conducting their official duties to express solidarity with people in the border areas.

01-11-2020||New Delhi||At 40 pc, stubble burning contribution in Delhi’s pollution soars to season’s high||The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution rose to 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season, according to a central government air quality monitoring agency.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said 3,216 farm fires were spotted over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand on Saturday.   The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution was 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season. It was 32 per cent on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday, the second highest this season so far.Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.      SAFAR said air quality has not improved much despite improved ventilation due to high stubble-related intrusion and trapping of pollutants during night time due to low wintertime boundary layer height.“However, it has not deteriorated further despite favourable North-North-Westerly boundary level wind direction. The highly favourable conditions for fire-related intrusion in Delhi is expected to continue,” it said.SAFAR predicted better ventilation for the next two days but said the AQI is likely to improve only marginally, depending on farm fires. It is set to deteriorate slightly on November 3, it said.The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 370 at 3 pm. The 24-hour average AQI was 367 on Saturday. It was 374 on Friday, 395 on Thursday, 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday and 353 on Monday.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-40-pc-stubble-burning-contribution-in-delhis-pollution-soars-to-seasons-high-164398
01-11-2020||New Delhi||Over 1 crore waitlisted passengers denied train travel in 2019-20: RTI||More than one crore passengers could not travel by trains despite buying tickets in 2019-2020 because of being waitlisted, a query filed under the RTI has found, indicating a shortage of trains on busy routes in the country. The RTI reply has said in 2019-2020, a total of 84,61,204 Passenger Name Record (PNR) numbers, against which 1.25 crore passengers were scheduled to travel, were automatically cancelled due to being waitlisted.The Railway Ministry has for the first time taken measures to reduce waitlisting for train travel with the introduction of private trains.The Railways has also introduced special ‘clone trains’ on the routes which generally have high passenger traffic. These trains have limited stoppages/halts and faster transit time. They primarily have 3-tier AC coaches and will run ahead of the already operating special trains on the same route. The Advance Reservation Period (ARP) of these ‘clone trains’ is 10 days.The waitlisting of passengers and the automatic cancellation of tickets have been a problem for the Railways over the years with the national transporter unable to meet the demands of its growing customers.After cancellation of PNRs, the ticket fare is refunded to the passengers.In the last five years, almost five crore PNRs were automatically cancelled because of being waitlisted, said the RTI filed by Madhya Pradesh-based activist Chandra Shekhar Gaur. While in 2014-15, the number of cancelled PNRs stood at 1,13,17,481, the number in 2015-2016 was 81,05,022, in 2016-2017 it was, 72,13,131, the next year it was 73,02,042 and in 2018-2019, the number stood at 68,97,922.Chairman and CEO of the Railway Board too in a press briefing earlier had acknowledged the need for reducing waitlisting in trains and said with the introduction of private trains, the number of waitlisted passengers will decrease.According to official figures, the passenger sector requirement in 2019-2020 was 8.4 billion. The average drop in the waiting list was 8.9 per cent in 2019-20. During the busy season, 13.3 per cent passengers were not able to get confirmed reservations. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-1-crore-waitlisted-passengers-denied-train-travel-in-2019-20-rti-164397

01-11-2020||Patna||Nitish will quit NDA after assembly polls, try to challenge PM Modi in 2024: Chirag||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar may ditch the BJP after the assembly poll results are out, join the RJD-led Grand Alliance and make yet another attempt at posing a challenge to the NDA in the 2024 general elections, Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan claimed on Sunday.Paswan, who has chosen to plough a lonely furrow in the ongoing assembly elections, reiterated that the LJP was and will remain loyal towards the BJP, which was staring at the spectre of yet another "paltimaar" (volte face) by the JD(U) president."Nitish Kumar has earned the epithet 'palturam' (turncoat) by virtue of his frequent acts of paltimaar. He came to power in Bihar after a long political battle with RJD chief Lalu Prasad. A few years later, he snapped ties with the BJP, an old ally and ended up forging an alliance with his arch rival," he told a news channel.Paswan, whose late father and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan, joined the NDA ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, recalled "criticisms heaped on (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi" by Kumar, who had been opposed to his then Gujarat counterpart."Fancying himself as a potential challenger to the prime minister nationally, Kumar, with Lalu Prasad by his side, spewed so much venom against Modi in the assembly polls held just five years ago. It took him just two years to dump Lalu and return to the NDA," he said with a hint of sarcasm."Mark my words, he has been very caustic against Lalu Prasad during his election campaign, but given his disposition he may once again cross over, try to form the next government with the Grand Alliance, and even try to project himself as an alternative to Modi in 2024," Paswan, who is the MP from Jamui, said.Earlier, the LJP chief addressed a press conference where he repeated the allegations of corruption in 'saat nishchay' (seven resolves) which included, among other things, schemes for bringing piped water to every household and fortifying alleys and ditches with concrete."Corruption in these schemes ought to be thoroughly probed, and we must not be surprised if the complicity of the chief minister himself comes to the fore," he added.The LJP has fielded its candidates in over 140 seats of the 243-strong assembly, mostly against those fighting on a JD(U) ticket. Paswan's party has shied away from taking on the BJP in most of the 110 seats being contested by the saffron party.It has also made an exception in the JD(U)'s case at Hassanpur, where interestingly, it is being felt that the LJP wants to help Tej Pratap Yadav, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad's elder son, who is pitted against the sitting MLA belonging to the chief minister's party.

01-11-2020||Raipur||New farms laws will weaken nation's foundation: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said the three new farm laws enacted by the Centre will "weaken" the foundation of the nation, and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reconsider the laws in the interest of farmers.Virtually addressing the Chhattisgarh statehood day celebrations, Gandhi hailed a scheme launched by the state government to set English medium schools in all districts, saying the language provides a global opportunity to youth.The function to celebrate the statehood of Chhattisgarh, which came into existence on November 1, 2000 after being carved out of Madhya Pradesh, was held at Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghels official residence here. Gandhi said the country has been witnessing a tough phase due to COVID-19 outbreak. In such a situation, the weakest sections like farmers, labourers, small businessmen, mothers, sisters and youth are the worst-affected."The condition of farmers in the country is known to everyone. We read news of farmer suicides every day. In a way, it is happening on such a scale that the country has accepted it," he said."But we should not accept it. We should protect farmers, labourers and small businessmen and stand with them," the former Congress president said.Farmers and labourers are the foundation of the country. Villages are the foundation of cities while farmers and labourers are the foundation of villages, he said."If we weaken the foundation - the farmers and the labourers - then the entire structure will weaken. When we protect farmers and labourers, we are not only protecting them but also safeguarding our nation and its future," Gandhi said."Similarly, youth and children are the foundation of our future. If we do not give opportunity to them, then we will be weakening the future of the nation," he added.Referring to the farm laws enacted by the central government, Gandhi said, "I am pained that farmers in the country are being attacked."He noted that recently during an election rally in Bihar, he said mandi (farm produce markets) and minimum support price (MSP) hold a great significance and these ensure protection to the interests of farmers and labourers."I accept that there can be lacunae in mandi, MSP and procurement systems, but if we destroy the entire system, like it was done in Bihar in 2006, then the countrys foundation will be destroyed. Therefore, we have been fighting against the three new central farm laws, he said.Gandhi also said he had asked the prime minister to reconsider these laws and strengthen the mandi system."If there are less number of Mandis, then increase it, and if there are flaws in the MSP, then rectify it, but dont destroy the entire system."I am confident that the PM will reconsider the three laws in view of the sentiments of farmers as these laws will weaken the countrys foundation," Gandhi said.On the occasion, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel released the third installment of cash benefit under the Rajiv Gandhi Kisan Nyay Yojna to 18.38 lakh farmers in the state.Baghel also launched the Swami Atmanand Government English Medium School scheme, aimed at providing education in the English language to students across the state.The CM also dedicated mobile hospital-cum-laboratories in 30 urban slum areas under the Chief Minister Urban Slum Health Scheme.Hailing the schemes, Gandhi said, "Many people will think what will happen if English medium schools are started.But the English language provides a global opportunity to youth. Hindi and our local languages have their own place. But English language gives global opportunities." "The poor people should get this opportunity. We believe the sons of farmers and labourers should getbig opportunities," he said.Lauding the initiatives taken up by the Baghel government, he said, "Chhattisgarh has set an example for the entire nation in terms of welfare initiatives for farmers, labourers and youths. The state government has been working with a new vision." PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-farms-laws-will-weaken-nations-foundation-rahul-gandhi-164382
01-11-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 risk in airplanes, restaurants, grocery stores cannot be easily compared: Scientists||While a recent study has claimed that dining out, and grocery shopping could be more dangerous than air travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, partly due to special ventilation systems in airplanes, some scientists say such a comparison cannot be made without knowing if mask-wearing and social distancing norms are properly followed in each of these scenarios.In the research, funded by airlines, airports and aircraft manufacturers, scientists from the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health in the US, said the ventilation system in airplanes made of High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters continuously circulate and refresh the air supply, "filtering out more than 99 per cent of the particles that cause COVID-19."However, researchers including Arnold I Barnett from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, said the HEPA filters may not function as effectively in airplanes as the report suggests."HEPA filters are very good, but not as effective as US airlines suggest. They are not foolproof and there are numerous examples of transmission despite these filters," Barnett, a professor of statistics with a focus on problems of health and safety, told PTI.He noted that transmission probability depends on a contagious passenger's emissions of the virus via breathing, speaking, and coughing or sneezing—a mixture that varies from person to person—as well as the movement of droplets and aerosols given the geometry of the airplane and its powerful HEPA air-purification systems."None of the processes is fully understood for COVID-19," the MIT scientist noted.Abraar Karan from the Department of Medicine at Harvard Medical School in the US, also expressed concern about transmission risk aboard airplanes."For those considering flying, the reality is that while planes have great ventilation systems, we don't have a good idea of how many COVID-19 cases were actually infected on the flight itself," Karan tweeted."We are not testing the right way to figure this out," he added.Commenting on the risk of contracting COVID-19 in airplanes as compared to the odds in grocery stores and restaurants, Justin Yang from the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health, who was unrelated to the study, said such an evaluation "cannot be made in a simple way."Yang, whose team recently published a study on COVID-19 infection among grocery store workers at an outlet in the US, said "there isn't really a safer-riskier order of situations between airplanes and grocery stores as it depends on many factors.""It ultimately depends on the distance you maintain from an infected person. The closer you are to someone with the virus, the more chances you may be of getting infected," he told PTI.The public health researcher added that the risk in airplanes is "not as significant as people think," due to the airflow patterns, enhanced cleaning, and mandatory mask-wearing."However, if you are sitting right next to an infected person, there is a significant chance of getting infected," Yang added.Barnett concurred.He said, to compare risk scenarios, one must know if social distancing and mask-wearing measures are enforced adequately in the respective settings.According to the MIT researcher, removing masks for extended periods in each of the settings—grocery stores, restaurants, and airplanes—"attenuates the benefits of mask-wearing."Based on his team's yet-to-be peer-reviewed study, he said taking off masks for consuming food offered in commercial planes, may significantly increase the risk of passengers getting infected with the virus.If a person in a two-hour airplane journey removes their mask for about 20 minutes, Barnett said "it increases the transmission risk by 33 per cent.""Masks reduce transmission risk by about two-thirds. If X is the transmission risk over 20 minutes with a mask, and thus 3X without a mask, then the total risk is about 6X for a two-hour flight, and 8X (i.e., 5X + 3X) with a 20-minute mask break. The ratio of 8X to 6X is 1.33. Of course, this is an approximation," he explained.While the mortality risk for domestic air passengers who contract COVID-19 may be below the US population-wide average, Barnett and his team said, COVID-19 infections on planes can cause deaths to some people who were not passengers."These indirect victims of infections incurred during flights (i.e. of tertiary infections) could well outnumber the direct victims," he noted.

01-11-2020||Bhopal||MP bypolls: Jyotiraditya  Scindia mistakenly seeks votes for Congress||In a slip of the tongue, BJP Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia asked people to vote for his former party Congress during a campaign for the November 3 by-elections in Madhya Pradesh.A video, in which Scindia is seen seeking votes for the Congress during a rally on Saturday in favour of BJP candidate Imarti Devi from Dabra town in Gwalior, has gone viral on social media.In the video, Scindia is heard saying, "My people of Dabra, raise your hand and make your fist to convince (state chief minister) Shivraj Singh and me, make us believe that you will press the 'hand' button on November 3." However, the BJP leader immediately amended his sentence and appealed to people to vote for the 'kamal' (lotus) symbol of the saffron party.Taking a dig at the goof-up, the state Congress's Twitter handle shared the video and said, "Scindia ji, the people of Madhya Pradesh assure you that they will press the key (on EVM) of 'Hath ka Panja' (Congress's symbol) on November 3."When contacted, state BJP spokesman Pankaj Chaturvedi told PTI that such a goof-up can happen by any person."It was a simple slip of the tongue and this can happen with anybody. Scindia immediately rectified. Everybody knows that he is a BJP leader," he said.Scindia, 49, had joined Congress in 2002. After 18 years, he quit the party in March this year.As many as 22 MP Congress MLAs loyal to him also resigned, which brought down the Kamal Nath-led state government.Later, Scindia and his loyalists joined the BJP.Bypolls to a total of 28 seats in the state will be held on November 3.

01-11-2020||New Delhi||India continues to have one of the lowest COVID-19 cases per million globally||Active cases of COVID-19 in India remained below 6 lakh for the third consecutive day, comprising  only 6.97 per cent of the total caseload, the Union Health Ministry said on Sunday.The trajectory of the active caseload across different states and UTs has been diverse demonstrating their focused efforts and gradual progress in their fight against COVID-19, the ministry said, noting Karnataka has reported a steep decline in the active cases in a span of 24 hours."With the consistent decline in the active cases, the cases per million in India are among the lowest in the world. India's average cases per million stands at 5,930," it highlighted.Seventeen states and UTs have COVID-19 cases per million lower than the national average."For the third day after the active cases dropped below the 6 lakh mark after nearly three months, the progressive decline has been maintained," the ministry underlined Presently, there are 5,70,458 active coronavirus infections in the country.The active cases have dropped to only 6.97 per cent of the total cases of the country demonstrating a steady falling percentage of the total cases, the ministry stated.This sustained achievement is the result of collaborative action by states and UTs under the Centre's strategy of comprehensive testing, timely tracking, quick hospitalization and adherence to the Standard Treatment Protocol which has ensured a standardised quality of medical care across the public and private hospitals and for the home isolation cases.There has been a steady decline in the number of daily deaths in India. A total 470 deaths have been reported in a span of 24 hours in the country. India's deaths per million population is one of the lowest in the world and stands at 88.Twenty-one states and UTs have deaths per million lower than the national average, the ministry said."The declining trend of the percentage active cases is commensurately supported by the rising percentage of recovered cases. The total recovered cases have surged to 74,91,513 and exceed active cases of COVID-19 by 69,21,055.With an increasing number of recoveries, this gap is continuously widening.Higher number of recoveries has aided the national recovery rate to further improve to 91.54 per cent.A total of 58,684 people have recovered and were discharged in a span of 24 hours as against 46,963 infections reported during the same period.Seventy-six per cent of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 states and UTs.Karnataka, Kerala and Maharashtra have contributed the maximum to the new recovered cases with more than 7,000 single day recoveries. Delhi and West Bengal, both have added more than 4,000 to the new recoveries, the ministry said.A total of 46,963 new coronavirus infections were recorded in a span of 24 hours of which 77 per cent are from 10 states and UTs. Kerala is still reporting a very high number of new cases with more than 7,000 cases followed by Maharashtra and Delhi with more than 5,000 cases.As many as 470 case fatalities have been reported in a span of 24 hours.

01-11-2020||Patna/New Delhi||Hate speeches, personal remarks by leaders not good for healthy democracy: Rajnath Singh||Concerned over the deteriorating political discourse in the country, senior BJP leader and union minister Rajnath Singh has said elections shouldn’t be fought and won by spreading hatred among people and there should be no place for “bitterness and acidic remarks” in a healthy democracy.He also expressed confidence that the NDA will win the Bihar elections and asserted that the exit of the Chirag Paswan-led LJP won’t impact the poll prospects of the ruling alliance. Singh also rejected allegations of any hidden understanding with Paswan’s party, saying the BJP believes in fair politics and doesn’t play with the trust of the people.“Chirag and his party would have their own reasons for leaving the alliance. But I don’t think LJP would have any impact on the ruling BJP-JD(U) alliance in Bihar assembly polls. Our alliance will win the elections and form the next government in the state,” he said.When pointed out that Paswan in his election campaign was only attacking Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and not the BJP, Singh said, “Personal animosity is not good for healthy politics. It should be avoided and I myself also don’t practice such politics.”The former BJP president also termed as baseless the allegations of a hidden understanding between the BJP and the LJP. “BJP believes in fair politics and doesn’t play with the trust of the people,” he said.Expressing concern over hate speeches and personal remarks being made against each other by leaders of all political parties, Singh said there is no place for hatred in healthy politics and elections should not be contested and won by spreading hatred among people. “I myself never resorted to such tactics,” he said.“Bitterness, acidic remarks and personal attacks against each other in speeches should be avoided. It is not good for a healthy democracy. Rather, there should be discussion, debates and even arguments on issues of public interest,” he said.Singh, who has addressed more than a dozen political rallies in Bihar and is scheduled to address many rallies in the coming days, said the response he witnessed in his public meetings is highly indicative that the BJP-JD(U) alliance will win the elections in the state.“The alliance, in the Bihar assembly polls, will reap the benefits of effective implementation of the Central government’s welfare schemes. At the same time the state government under Nitish Kumar has also performed well and the people will vote for it,” he said.Singh, the senior-most minister in the Central Government, said the Modi dispensation “ended the crisis of credibility” in politics.“The Modi government delivered on its promises and its track record establishes that. On the other hand, the Opposition, whether in Bihar or at the national level, lacks credibility as it always failed to fulfil its commitments,” he said.On Tejaswi Yadav’s rallies attracting huge crowds, Singh said the rallies of BJP leaders are also being attended by people in large numbers.“You yourself saw attendance in my rallies and you must have seen the massive crowds in Prime Minister Modi’s rallies. Public meetings organised by BJP are attracting huge crowds. It will be unfair to exaggerate about public meetings of one party and its leaders,” he said.Asked if the NDA was shrinking as some of its oldest constituents have left the ruling alliance, Singh said the alliance is still a “big united family”.Without naming any party, Singh said, “Those who left NDA moved out of the alliance for their respective reasons. In politics you never know when anyone can become your ally”.On whether the NDA’s doors were still open for its erstwhile allies, he said, “The NDA’s doors are always open for those who want to contribute in the development of India. But we cannot compromise on our development agenda and the core issues of our ideology”.Singh has twice been the BJP president and the party contested two Lok Sabha elections — in 2009 and in 2014 — when he was at the helm.Currently the Union Defence Minister, Singh was Home Minister in the previous NDA government.

01-11-2020||New Delhi||Ayurveda drugs can be effective in mild to moderate cases of COVID-19: AIIA||A team of doctors from the Delhi-based All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) under the Ayush Ministry has found that Ayurveda interventions like Ayush kwatha and Fifatrol tablets can be effective in mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 infection in a "very short period" with "complete regression of symptoms".Use of four Ayurveda interventions—Ayush kwatha, Sanshamanivati, Fifatrol tablets and Laxmivilasa rasa not only improved the condition of COVID-19 patient but also turned the rapid antigen test negative within six days of treatment, according to a case report published in the journal of AIIA—'Ayurved Case Report' in October.Presently, there is no specific cure for the disease that has infected over 44.7 million people and claimed 1.17 million lives world over.Citing the case of a 30-year-old male health worker infected with coronavirus, the report said his infection was managed with Samshamana therapy that included oral administration of Ayush kwatha, Sanshamani vati, Fifatrol tablets, and Laxmivilasa rasa.The patient after testing positive for COVID-19 was advised home quarantine."The mentioned treatment plan was effective in the symptomatic relief (fever, dyspnea, anorexia, fatigue, anosmia, and dysgeusia) as well as in the resolution of viral load, as the patient tested negative in the RAD for COVID-19 within six days of intervention and RT-PCR test was also done on day 16, which was reported negative," the study said.    Herbal drug Fifatrol developed by AIMIL Pharmaceutical helps fight infection, flu and cold. It has immunity strengthening herbs like guduchi, sanjeevini ghanvati, daruharidra, apamarga, chirayata, karanja, kutaki, tulsi, godanti (bhasam), mrityunjaya rasa, tribhuvana kriti rasa and sanjivani vati.Ayush Kwatha is a combination of four medicinal herbs commonly used in every Indian kitchen - basil leaves (tulsi), cinnamon bark (dalchini), Zingiber officinale (sunthi), and krishna marich (Piper nigrum).Sanshamani Vati (also called guduchi ghana vati) is an ayurvedic herbal formulation used for all types of fevers.Laxmivilas Ras is a traditional herbomineral medicine that mainly contains Abhrak Bhasma and cures cough, cold and rhinitis. It soothes the throat and sinuses.  The report has been authored by Dr Sisir Kumar Mandal, Dr Meenakshi Sharma, Dr Charu Sharma, Dr Shalini Rai and Dr Anand More from the AIIA."The present case study proved the efficacy of Ayurveda interventions in mild-to-moderate case of COVID-19 infection in a very short period with complete regression of symptoms," the report said.“The treatment was personalised, holistic, and purely based on Ayurvedic principles, and no conventional medicines were used. With this case study, it can be inferred that Ayurveda has vast potential to address COVID-19 and such other pandemics; a large sample-sized, multi-center randomized and controlled clinical studies are the need of the hour," the report said.

01-11-2020||New Delhi||Vedanta, Adani among others in race for coal blocks to be auctioned for commercial mining from Monday||Companies like Vedanta, Jindal Steel and Power, Adani Enterprises, Hindalco Industries and JSW Steel are in the race for the first-ever auction of 19 coal blocks for commercial mining, which will kick-start from Monday.The auction under which 19 coal blocks would go under the hammer will continue for eight days, from November 2-9, according to the latest calendar for electronic auction of the coal ministry. On Monday, the electronic auction would be held for five coal blocks --Chakla, Jharkhand; Marki Mangli-II, Maharashtra; Radhikapur (West), Odisha; Takli-Jena-Bellora (North) & TakliJena-Bellora (South), Maharashtra; and Urtan, Madhya Pradesh.Companies like Hindalco Industries and Adani Enterprises will be vying for Chakla coal block in Jharkhand on Monday.In the case of Radhikapur (West) coal block in Odisha, companies like Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) and Vedanta Ltd are in the race.With regard to Marki Mangli-II block in Maharashtra, Yazdani International Pvt Ltd, Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation Ltd and Refex Industries Ltd will be competing against each other. Aurobindo Reality and Infrastructure Pvt Ltd and Sunflag Iron and Steel Company Ltd are in the race for Takli-Jena-Bellora (North) and TakliJena-Bellora (South) coal block in Maharashtra.JMS Mining Private Ltd and Stratatech Mineral Resources Pvt Ltd would be vying for Urtan block in Madhya Pradesh. In June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the auction process for 41 coal blocks for commercial mining, a move that opens India's coal sector to private players, and termed it a major step in the direction of India achieving self-reliance. The auction of coal blocks for commercial mining is expected to garner Rs 33,000 crore of capital investment over the next five to seven years. The launch of the auction process not only marks the beginning of unlocking of the country's coal sector from the lockdown of decades but aims at making India the largest exporter of coal, the prime minister had said.  Despite being the world's fourth-largest producer, India is the second-largest importer of the dry-fuel. The coal ministry had later revised the list of mines to be auctioned. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vedanta-adani-among-others-in-race-for-coal-blocks-to-be-auctioned-for-commercial-mining-from-monday-164363

You failed to conduct adequate out-of-specification (OOS) and complaint investigations, including the identification of the root cause and timely implementation of effective corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) plans," the USFDA noted.The US health regulator sought a comprehensive, independent assessment of the company's overall system for investigating deviations, discrepancies, complaints, OOS results, and failures."Provide a detailed action plan to remediate this system. Your action plan should include, but not be limited to, significant improvements in investigation competencies, scope determination, root cause evaluation, CAPA effectiveness, quality assurance unit oversight, and written procedures," it noted.The USFDA also pointed out the company's failure to follow adequate written procedures describing the handling of all written and oral complaints regarding a drug product including the review by the quality control unit of any complaint involving the possible failure of a drug product to meet any of its specifications.“Because you failed to correct the repeat violation from the previous inspection, we strongly recommend engaging a consultant qualified to evaluate your operations to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements,” it added.Until all corrections have been completed and FDA has confirmed corrections of the violations and the firm's compliance with CGMP, FDA may withhold approval of any new applications or supplements, the USFDA said.In addition, the company's failure to correct these violations may result in FDA continuing to refuse admission of articles manufactured at the plant into the US, it added.The FDA issued the letter on October 9 and has given the company 15 days to respond.

01-11-2020||New Delhi||Government eyes setting up 14 more water aerodromes for seaplane services||The government is looking to set up 14 more water aerodromes across the country after the successful launch of maiden seaplane service by Prime Minister Narendra Modi between the Statue of Unity near Kevadiya in Gujarat's Narmada district and Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad.These will facilitate seaplane services on various routes including Lakshadweep, Andaman & Nicobar, Assam, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand."Development of 14 more water aerodromes is being planned pan India under RCS UDAN scheme. Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) had requested Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) to conduct a hydrographic survey and later on requested assistance in setting up jetties for facilitating the passenger movement," a Shipping Ministry official told PTI.Shipping Minister Mansukh Mandaviya last week told PTI that post the launch of seaplane service at Gujarat, regular services are being planned on various routes including in Guwahati, Andaman & Nicobar and Uttarakhand."The potential locations include Tehri Dam in Uttarakhand, Guwahati riverfront and Umrangso reservoir in Assam, Khindsi Dam and Erai Dam in Maharashtra, Prakasam barrage in Andhra Pradesh, Minicoy and Kavaratti in Lakshadweep, Havelock, Neil, Long and Hutbay islands in Andaman & Nicobar and Dharoi and Shatrunjaya in Gujarat," according to a Shipping Ministry document.IWAI has set up concrete jetties for the maiden seaplane project in Gujarat in record time, the official said and added IWAI has been entrusted for hydrographic survey, floating jetties and navigational buoys.Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships (DGLL) had used differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) technology, essentially a system to provide provisional corrections to GPS signals to mark the runway and shallow water in Gujarat for landing of the seaplane in daylight visibility while provision has already been made over installed buoys for fixing automated navigation lights for operation during nights in the future, the document mentioned.For the maiden seaplane service no-frills carrier SpiceJet has chartered a seaplane from the Maldives, the official said and added that more such seaplanes will be hired once services start at other places.These seaplanes will be Twin Otters."From the Maldives to the Canadian North, the Twin Otter has proven itself as the largest-selling 14-passenger commuter airplane in the world for over 40 years. Its an un-pressurized, all-metal, high-wing, twin-turboprop aircraft and is certified in the Normal Category by the Canadian Department of Transportation," a Shipping Ministry document mentioned.Prime Minister Modi on October 31 inaugurated India's maiden seaplane service by boarding the twin-engine plane from pond-3 close to Sardar Sarovar Dam after taking part in the Ekta Diwas celebrations at the Statue of Unity on the occasion of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's 145th birth anniversary.The plane carrying Modi had landed on the waters of Sabarmati Riverfront in Ahmedabad in around 40 minutes after covering a distance of around 200 km.Floating jetties and water aerodrome buildings were built at the riverfront and at pond-3 near Sardar Sarovar Dam to enable passengers to board and alight from the plane.The service will be operated by SpiceJet's fully-owned subsidiary, Spice Shuttle. Daily two flights will be operated on the Ahmedabad-Kevadiya route from Saturday, the company had said in a statement.The Gujarat government in July this year had cleared a proposal to enter into a tri-party agreement with Union Ministry of Civil Aviation and Airports Authority of India (AAI) for the construction of four water aerodromes under the regional connectivity scheme for seaplane service.A water aerodrome or seaplane base is an area of open water used by seaplanes, float-planes and amphibious aircraft for landing and taking off.

01-11-2020||Kolkata||Pollution board to abide by govt's COVID advisory, 90-db noise cap for Diwali in place: Official||The West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) said on Sunday that the existing noise cap of 90 decibel on crackers will be in place during this Diwali, and all COVID-19 advisories by the state and the Centre would be strictly followed to avoid the spread of the viral disease.The pollution watchdog is working in tandem with the state police to stop supply of crackers that violate the norm, and raids to bust illegal fireworks manufacturing units would soon be conducted, WBPCB member secretary Rajesh Kumar said.Asked if any step was being taken to ensure that smoke generated from the fireworks do not harm patients with lung ailments, especially in the midst of the pandemic, he told PTI, "We will go by the recommendations of the government. As of now, we will launch a crackdown on firecrackers exceeding permissible sound threshold. But yes, we have to keep the health issue in mind, too."Kumar also said that a virtual meeting would be held with all stakeholders involved in organising the festival of lights to apprise them of the regulations.He further said that if the Calcutta High Court issues any direction for Diwali celebrations, as was the case during Durga puja, the WBPCB would adhere to the instructions, and measures would be taken accordingly.A Howrah resident is planning to move a PIL seeking total ban on sale and manufacture of fireworks, amid COVID-19, his lawyer Sabyasachi Chatterjee told a news channel on Saturday.A doctors' organisation here has recently approached Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, seeking restrictions on the use of firecrackers, apprehending that the smoke emanated may endanger the health of the COVID 19-affected.A senior WBPCB official said the board may consider banning firecracker use in the vicinity of COVID hospitals, safe homes for coronavirus patients and quarantine centres, if that was possible under the existing parameters of law.Joint teams of the WBPCB and the police will hit the streets of Kolkata and its adjoining areas with devices to monitor the decibel level of firecrackers, ahead of the November 14 festival, the official stated.Last year, nearly 5,000 kg of banned firecrackers were seized during raids, he added.

01-11-2020||New Delhi||2,061 girls among 3,531 children adopted in 2019-20: Govt data||A total of 3,531 children, including 2,061 girls, were adopted in India during the one year period ending March 31 with Maharashtra recording the highest number of adoptions among states, according to government data.As per data from the Child Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), 1,470 boys and 2,061 girls were adopted from April 1, 2019, to March 31, 2020.In the context of widespread and generational preference for sons across cultures in the country, an official said people's mindset is slowly changing and they are becoming more accepting towards adopting girls. "We give them three choices - one can opt for a girl, a boy, or can give no preference (while applying for adopting a child). Many people prefer to adopt a girl child," he said.Activists, however, say more girls are adopted because more of them are available for adoption."Even a casual visit to an adoption agency will tell you there are far more girls than boys to select for adoption. So to attribute it to progressive values may be a bit exaggerated or over-simplistic," said Akhila Sivadas, executive director at the Centre for Advocacy and Research, a non-profit organisation.  She said many families have a strong preference for sons and go to the extent of taking recourse to pre-natal sex determination and selection to abort the female foetus, with some even abandoning the girl child.  "There is a sense of collective wrong and guilt among some people who genuinely strive to redress it by adopting girls," she said.According to the data, 3,120 children were adopted in the age group of 0-5 years while in the age group of 5-18 years as many as 411 children were adopted between April last year and March this year.The official said the adoption of older children continues to be an issue as most parents still prefer to adopt children below two years of age."People prefer to adopt younger children due to which it becomes more and more difficult to get a child adopted as he or she grows up," he said.Sivadas said people might prefer younger children to experience the joy of parenting a child from the time it is born or soon after it is born. "However, we must recognize that adoption is not always done with the altruistic motive of giving the child a better life. As a result children with any kind of challenges including inter-sex children are rarely adopted," she said. She further said, "to what extent all this is reflecting changing values is yet to be established and only an in-depth study can resolve this matter with some degree of certainty and authority".      Within the country, 3,110 children were adopted while 421 inter-country adoptions took place in 2019-20, according to the data.Among states, the largest number of children were adopted from Maharashtra at 615 followed by Karnataka at 272, Tamil Nadu at 271, Uttar Pradesh at 261 and Odisha at 251.The official said generally Maharashtra has the highest number of adoptions because it has over 60 adoption agencies while other states that are bigger have on an average 20 adoption agencies.The number of adoptions during 2019-20 is slightly lower than in 2018-19 when 3,745 children were adopted.The above data pertains to adoption of orphaned, abandoned and surrendered children and does not include children adopted from relatives or adoption of stepchildren.

The turnout in Phase 1 is showing that NDA is ahead," he said, attributing it to overwhelming support by 'maa' 'behan' and 'betis' of Bihar. Women are ensuring NDA's win, he said.The Congress did not even bother to remember Sardar Patel on his birth anniversary yesterday, he said calling it the biggest example of 'parivaarvaad' in such parties.Has any relative of Nitish Kumar or Narendra Modi reached the Rayya Sabha, he questioned saying that NDA believes in "sabka saath sabka vishwas".In Motihari, Modi speaks about women empowermentIn Motihari, apart from attacking the Opposition for doubting the government and forces on the Pulwama incident, he spoke about NDA schemes for women empowerment and other programmes to make Bihar ‘atmanurbhar’.Reiterating that the NDA is forming the next government in Bihar, he said: “All political pundits were claiming that no one will come out in corona times to vote... . But all these pundits were proven wrong... they don’t know that this is Bihar which taught the country lesson of democracy“I asked those conducting exit polls what is the message, they said Bihar has given its blessings to the NDA to form the next government...This effort should continue...The strength of mothers and daughters has to be connected,” he saidSeeking support from people, he asked “will anyone eat something which they know will give them a stomachache...make them sick No, because people know that it can make them sick. Will you allow Bihar to become such again? Will you promise not to make the mistake of making Bihar sick again?” he asked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/double-double-yuvraj-eyeing-bihar-modi-takes-a-dig-at-rahul-tejashwi-164339
01-11-2020||New Delhi||At 11.4°C, Delhi records season’s lowest temperature||The National Capital recorded a minimum temperature of 11.4 degrees Celsius on Sunday morning, the lowest this season so far, according to the India Meteorological Department.Normally, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, records a minimum of 15 to 16 degrees Celsius in the first week of November. The mercury dips to 11-12 degrees Celsius by the last week of November, it said.Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of IMD, said the absence of cloud cover was the major reason for the low minimum temperature.     Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. Another reason is calm winds, which allow formation of mist and fog, Srivastava said.         There hasn’t been much snowfall in the hills, so cold winds from that region are yet to start affecting Delhi’s weather, he added.The month of October was the coolest in 58 years in the national capital, according to IMD.         The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius, it said.Normally, Delhi records a mean minimum temperature of 19.1 degrees Celsius in October. The city recorded a mean minimum temperature of 17.5 degrees Celsius in October 2007, according to IMD.  On Thursday, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 12.5 degrees Celsius—the lowest in October in 26 years.The last time Delhi recorded such a low temperature in October was in 1994. The national capital had recorded a minimum of 12.3 degrees Celsius on October 31, 1994, according to IMD data.       The city recorded the all-time lowest temperature (9.4 degrees Celsius) on October 31, 1937, Srivastava said.

01-11-2020||New Delhi||Secularism as principle and practice in India is in 'danger': Shashi Tharoor||Secularism as principle and practice in India is in "danger" and the ruling dispensation may even try to remove the word from the Constitution, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has said, but asserted that "forces of hatred" cannot alter the country's secular character.Secularism is only a word and even if the government takes it out of the Constitution, it would still be a secular Constitution because of its basic structure, Tharoor told PTI in an interview on his new book 'The Battle of Belonging'.He also asserted that the Congress party cannot risk trying to become 'BJP Lite' as it may end up making it 'Congress Zero' and said his party was not offering a watered-down version of the BJP's political messaging and the spirit of Indian secularism was very much "alive and well" in the grand old party.Asked about his party being accused of peddling in soft Hindutva, Tharoor said he does recognise that there's a very real and tangible concern for some liberal Indians over the issue, but asserted that "we in the Congress party are very clear that we cannot allow ourselves to become a BJP-lite"."I have long argued that any attempt to emulate 'Pepsi Lite' by 'BJP Lite' will end up with us becoming like 'Coke Zero'—that is, 'Congress Zero'," the former Union minister said."Congress is not BJP in any shape or form, and we should not attempt to be a lighter version of something we are not. Nor are we trying to, in my view," he said.Underlining that the Congress makes a distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva, Tharoor said the Hinduism that "we respect is inclusive and non-judgemental", whereas Hindutva is a political doctrine based on exclusion."So we are not offering a watered-down version of the BJP's political messaging: Rahul Gandhi has made it explicitly clear that, for all his avowing his personal Hinduism by going to temples, he does not support any form of Hindutva, neither soft nor hard," the MP from Thiruvananthapuram said.Asked if the Congress needs to talk about secularism more often than it has been doing of late, Tharoor said he disagrees with the assertion that the Congress has not talked about secularism enough and the party on every opportunity has stressed its unshakeable commitment to secularism.On Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari's recent dig at Chief Minister Uddhav Thackrey over secularism, the Congress leader said he did suggest that Koshyari should be given a different letterhead to express such ideas, rather than the official "Raj Bhavan notepaper".On whether the word 'secularism' in the Constitution was in imminent danger, he said, "The word is only a word; but even if the government takes the word 'secularism' out of the Constitution, it is still a secular Constitution."After all, freedom of worship, freedom to profess and propagate your religion, freedom of expression, minority rights, and equality of all citizens, are all part of the basic structure of the Constitution, and they can't disappear by deleting a word, he asserted."The ruling dispensation may well try to do that: there is certainly a concerted effort to erode secularism and replace it with a sectarian way of being that offers no place to religious minorities in Indian society," he said."Secularism as principle and practice is in danger, but I do not see it falling anytime soon: India embodies tolerance and pluralism in its very essence, and I do not believe that forces of hatred can permanently overcome our fundamental secularism," he said.However, Tharoor cautioned that people must not let their guards down and must continue to oppose such regressive ideas wherever they arise.Talking about the controversy over a Tanishq advertisement which showed an inter-faith marriage and had to be withdrawn after a social media backlash, Tharoor said it offered yet another illustration of how "reactionary and bigoted certain right-wing fringe elements" have become, even as the ruling dispensation was quick to distance itself from the episode."But let us not forget that this is a Frankenstein's monster that they have created, sustained through organised and vicious social media trolls, and it's just one more reminder of the appalling power of the full-throated communal hatred that is so often unleashed in today's India," he said."As I have said, if such people are so infuriated by Hindu-Muslim 'ekatvam', why not boycott the world's longest-surviving symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity: India itself?" he asked.On whether Hindutva had gained mass popularity, Tharoor said the BJP holds a commanding parliamentary majority, but it has worked overtime to suppress dissenting voices and in that sense, it is difficult to get an accurate gauge of support for Hindutva among ordinary Indians.Asked about Congress leader P Chidambaram's recent remarks calling for the restoration of Article 370 and its criticism by the BJP, Tharoor said he has articulated his stand clearly within Parliament."It's not just an issue of abrogating 370—even (Jawaharlal) Nehru ji had said the provision was a temporary one. But the Constitution specifies how it is to be done," he said."So though it shouldn't matter what side of the debate on Article 370 you stand on—after all, differing voices are the lifeline of any democracy—the manner in which it was implemented, the way our own fellow citizens were overnight clamped down upon by their own government, consciously and willfully disregarding the democratically enshrined rights guaranteed to all Indians, does not bode well for the future of the country," he said.No political objective can justify the huge-scale abuse of the rights of Indian citizens in this manner, Tharoor said.

01-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's air quality remains 'very poor' due to 'unusually high' farm fires||The national capital's air quality remained “very poor” on Sunday with an “unusually high” number of farm fires negating the effect of better ventilation, according to a government forecasting agency.  However, the situation is likely to get better by Monday.  The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 366 at 8:30 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 367 on Saturday, 374 on Friday, 395 on Thursday, 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, and 353 on Monday.  An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitoring agency, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was 32 per cent on Saturday, the second-highest this season so far.  It was 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday -- the maximum so far this season.  According to the central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the fire count increased to an unusual high on Friday over Punjab (approx 4,266), Haryana (155), Uttar Pradesh (51) and Madhya Pradesh (381) impacting air quality in Delhi-NCR and other parts of northwest India.  NASA's satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.  SAFAR said Delhi's AQI did not improve much despite better ventilation, mainly because of highly favourable north-north westerly boundary level wind direction and perfect wind speed for the intrusion of pollutants from farm fires.  “Increased local surface wind speed with faster dispersion conditions are counteracting with increased fire-related emission and associated intrusion. But still, AQI is likely to improve for the next two days as dispersion will eventually play a lead role,” it said.  According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 15 kilometres per hour on Sunday.     Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  The city's ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was expected to be around 8,500 metre square per second on Sunday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants.  Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.  A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.

He handled the Ministry of Agriculture with full dedication and engraved his strong mark,” Purohit said in a message.Palaniswami, who described the late leader as an “elder brother,” said Doraikkannu had joined the AIADMK when it was founded by the late CM M G Ramachandran in 1972, adding he had served the party with dedication since then.Doraikkannu had efficiently handled his Agriculture portfolio, he said, describing him as an affable person.In a statement, the chief minister said the senior leader’s death was a “great loss” to the party and the state and extended his sympathies to the bereaved family.Palaniswami visited the hospital on Sunday and paid floral tributes to a portrait of Doraikkannu there.In a separate party statement, Panneerselvam and Palaniswami, AIADMK Coordinator and Co-Coordinator respectively, recalled the late minister’s decades-long association with the party and hailed him for his “effective public service.”Stalin, the Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly, expressed shock over the minister’s demise and noted that the latter used to reply during debates in the House “according to ethos”.In a statement, he urged those in public life to exercise caution during their work in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.Telangana Governor Tamiliasai Soundarajan and leaders of various political parties including Vaiko (MDMK), G K Vasan (TMC), S Ramadoss (PMK), L Murugan (BJP) and those of CPI and CPI-M also expressed their condolences.Doraikkannu had complained of uneassiness on October 13 while travelling to Salem and was rushed to the government medical college hospital in Villupuram. The same day, he was shifted to the Kauvery Hospital, where he tested positive for COVID-19.The hospital had said on Monday the Minister was being treated for severe COVID pneumonia and its complications and put on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), a heart- lung assistance machine, and ventilator.

The new standards define functional requirements for the institutions, which will be rated on defined minimum standards. These standards will apply to new colleges and the existing ones proposing to increase their annual intake from the academic year 2021-22. During the transitory period, the existing colleges will be governed by previous regulations.5-acre rider goesThe new regulations mandate the availability of a fully functional 300-bed multispecialty hospital for at least two years at the time of application for setting up a new college. The earlier regulations did not specify the period of functionality and required more beds. For example, 530 beds for a 100-seat college.In another path-breaking move, the NMC approved the hiring of visiting faculty over and above the existing faculty. The visiting faculty has been defined as “persons working in private healthcare, NGOs, retired medical personnel and Overseas Citizens of India interested in teaching”.Rules say anyone below 70 who possesses a PG degree in the specialty concerned and has a minimum of eight years of experience in that specialty after obtaining the degree will be eligible for appointment as visiting faculty.The NMC rules also allow medical colleges to operate from three campuses in tier 1 and 2 cities, provided the distance between these is not less than 10 km.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/medical-commission-eases-norms-allows-pivate-doctors-as-visiting-faculty-164066

Therefore, there can be no objection to the promise of such welfare in an election manifesto,” the EC is learnt to have said, adding that the trust of voters can be sought “on promises which are possible to be fulfilled”.It’s welfare measure: poll panelThere can be no objection to the promise of such welfare in an election manifesto… The trust of voters can be sought on promises which are possible to be fulfilled.
