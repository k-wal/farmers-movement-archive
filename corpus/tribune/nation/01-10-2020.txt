01-10-2020||New Delhi||Groundwork for new Parliament building begins; to be completed in 22 months||The groundwork for the new Parliament building has begun and the agencies have started digging soil in a plot where the structure will come up, officials said on Thursday.Last month, Tata Projects Limited won the bid to construct a new Parliament building near the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project.It is expected to be completed in around 22 months from the start of construction work. The new building will come up on plot number 118 of the Parliament House Estate.“One of the receptions for the entrance to Parliament building is being shifted to widen the space for movement of heavy vehicles,” an official said.He said small offices of the CPWD and a power station have been shifted from the plot to pave the way for the new Parliament building, adding that digging work has been started.Another official said the work to shift two entrances to the existing Parliament building has also begun.The redevelopment project of Central Vista—the nation’s power corridor—envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.                More MPs can be accommodated in the new building as the strength of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha may increase after delimitation of constituencies.It will have spacious seating arrangements for around 1,400 MPs. The building will be a reinforced cement concrete framed structure.According to the CPWD, the existing Parliament building will continue to function during the entire period of execution of the project. Once the new building is complete, the existing building will be used for other purposes.Last month, Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had told Lok Sabha that the Central Vista redevelopment project would generate large number of direct and indirect employment which could be “an important fulcrum for economic revival”.In his written reply to a question, Puri had said, “In the current economic scenario, the project shall generate large number of direct and indirect employment which could be an important fulcrum for economic revival.”He had also said that the estimated cost for construction of the new Parliament building was Rs 971 crore.About the rationale behind the need for the project, the minister had said that the existing Parliament House Building was started in 1921 and commissioned in 1927 and hence, the building is already 93 years old, adding that its facilities and amenities are “highly inadequate” to meet the current demand of Parliament.

01-10-2020||New Delhi||IMA criticises Centre for inappropriate medical reforms amid a pandemic||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has called out the Centre for responding inappropriately to the pandemic, on Thursday. In a strongly-worded statement, the national body of doctors has condemned the series of reforms in medical education the Centre has pushed recently.The IMA has alleged that concerns of the profession and people were brushed aside while enacting the National Medical Council Act 2019.They also referred to clause 32 of National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019, as a "crime against humanity", which entitles all healthcare practitioners license to practice medicine in primary care.As per the IMA, it will jeopardise the lives of the patients. "This single clause (32 of NMC Act) will cost India millions of lives as it will allow half and partially trained non-medical persons to treat patients,” said the IMA."The community health providers are an assorted group of persons connected with the modern scientific medical profession. They can be anyone from laboratory technicians to optometrists.“The NMC will provide them a licence to practice medicine in primary care. This will include a wide range of diseases and maternity. If they are overseen by other Community Health Providers, they can practice inside ICUs, critical care, operation theatres, emergencies, labour rooms, and anywhere in the secondary and critical care.“This single clause 32 will cost India millions of lives. Letting loose half and partially trained non-medical persons to treat patients is a crime against humanity," it explained.The IMA also condemned the centre's ambitious 'one nation one system' policy in medical education and called it a cocktail of disaster."The government is alleged to have favoured 'one nation one system' which is a cocktail for disaster. The National Educational Policy will enable a mix all systems of medicine and produce hybrid doctors. In effect, doctors of modern medicine as existing today will cease to exist in a decade. The nation will produce only hybrid doctors of questionable repute," it said.Besides, the IMA also shared its concern on the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2020, which allows assorted paramedics to practice medicine independently. "It is the final nail in the coffin," it commented."What the government has in store for the nation is a lytic cocktail of mixing all systems (mixopathy) allowing all systems to practise modern medicine (crosspathy) allowing unqualified non-medical persons entry into medical register and legitimising their practise in primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals (official quackery) as well as allowing paramedics to become medics. Modern medicine as a science will be extinct in India by 2030," said the IMA.The apex body of doctors criticised that the Centre's "inappropriate" response to the pandemic has come at a time when modern medicine has stood tall in the face of a pandemic, and its doctors have saved millions of lives to contain the case fatality rate at 1.7 per cent."Their (government's) own statistics show that 96 per cent of patients prefer modern medicine," the IMA added.The IMA also resolved to resist the latest moves by the Centre. "We resolve to resist these ill-conceived moves. Dignity and honour of the medical profession are not for barter. The doctors and the medical students of India will jointly resist these serious infringes on the health of the nation in the name of people of India," said the apex medical association.Last week, through a gazette notification, the Centre dissolved the Medical Council of India and formed NMC to function as the country's apex regulatory body of medical education and profession.

Owing to these illegal practices of Amnesty, the previous government had also rejected the repeated applications of Amnesty to receive funds from overseas,” the MHA had said earlier.Amnesty International had called the freezing of its Indian outfit’s account as a “witch hunt” but the government has said laws don’t permit interference in domestic political debates by entities funded by foreign donations.“This law applies equally to all and it shall apply to Amnesty International as well. Amnesty’s failure to comply with local regulations does not entitle them to make comments on the democratic and plural character of India,” the Home Ministry had said earlier.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-us-uk-eu-allow-organisations-to-break-their-laws-asks-mea-on-banning-amnestys-operations-149468

01-10-2020||New Delhi||At 109% LPA, 2020 monsoon saw third highest rains after 1994 and 2019||With 109 per cent of the Long Period Average (LPA), the 2020 monsoon registered third highest rains after 112 per cent LPA (1994) and 110 per cent LPA (2019), the IMD said on Thursday.The southwest monsoon, which ended its four-month run officially yesterday, received 95.8 cm between June 1 and September 30 against the long period average of 88.0 cm based on data of 1961-2010 (109% of the LPA)Considering the recent years since 1990, the all India seasonal rainfall this year was third highest, as per the IMD’s end of season report.This also makes 2019 and 2020 two consecutive years with above normal monsoon rainfall after 1958 (110% of LPA) and 1959 (114% of LPA). The year also saw an over-active August with back to back low pressure systems over the north Bay of Bengal.Of 36 meteorological subdivisions, two received large excess, 13 received excess and 16 subdivisions received normal monsoon rainfall. Of the five subdivisions that received deficient rains are Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura (-32%), West Uttar Pradesh (-37%), Uttarakhand (-20%), Himachal Pradesh (-26%), Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh (-34%)As on October 1, monsoon has withdrawn from Punjab, western Himalayan region, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and many parts of Rajasthan and some parts of Uttar Pradesh.The withdrawal line is currently passing through Lakhimpur Kheri, Shahjhanpur, Alwar, Nagaur.Meanwhile, according to a study by the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG) global climatic events like the Roman Warm Period, Medieval Climate Anomaly, and the Little Ice Age may have had significant impacts on India’s landscape, vegetation, and socio-economic growth, with abrupt shifts in the Indian monsoon coinciding with these climatic events.The study carried out with lake sediments from Rewalsar Lake, a freshwater lake from Mandi district of Himachal Pradesh, could resolve the long debate among scientists about whether such events were local or global.Sediments from this lake preserve signature that can be used as proxies to understand monsoon variability in the past, says an official statement by the DST.The study shows wet monsoon conditions in the north-western Himalaya between 1200 and 550 BCE. This condition prevailed till 450 AD, coinciding with the Roman Warm Period (RWP).It was followed by reduced precipitation and a weak ISM till 950 AD and then strengthened during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) between 950 and 1350 AD. During the Little Ice Age, there was a pronounced reduction in monsoon precipitation, as per the DST. Graphics*Monsoon withdrew from western parts of Northwest on September 28 against normal date September 17, a delay of around 11 days.August saw back to back  low pressure systems over the north Bay of Bengal .Arabian Sea was very active with strong winds reaching up to 50-60 kmph in lower levels for a few days in the month.*Five low pressure systems formed during August 2020 which caused higher than normal rainfall over central and western part of India.*Total number of low pressure days in August was 28 against normal of about 17||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-109-lpa-2020-monsoon-saw-third-highest-rains-after-1994-and-2019-149451

My daughter's case should be probed by the CBI and monitored by a Supreme Court judge. We are under pressure from officials and confined to our home while the media has also been disallowed from meeting us,” he said in a purported video shared by Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Twitter.यूपी सरकार किसी को पीड़िता के गांव जाने से क्यों रोक रही है उसका जवाब यहां है?पीड़िता के परिवार को हाथरस डीएम जाकर धमका रहे हैं। न मीडिया जा पायेगा, न हम लोग तो यूपी सरकार पीड़िता के परिवार को खुलकर धमका पाएगी।ये लोग अत्याचारी हैं। pic.twitter.com/RDV2jrQfRnThe development came as a video surfaced purportedly showing Hathras District Magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar meeting the family at their home, where he allegedly asked the woman's father to “reconsider” if he wants to stick with the statement or change it.“Aap apni vishwasniyata khatam mat kariye. Media wale main aapko bata doon… aaj abhi aadhe chale gaye, kal subah tak aadhe aur nikal jaenge aur 2-4 din bachenge ... Hum hi bas khade hain aapke saath mein, thik hai. Ab aapki ichha hai, aapko baar-baar bayaan badalna hai, nahi badalna hai...(You should not destroy your credibility. About the media, I must tell you, half of them have left today… the other half would leave by tomorrow morning... two or four more days maybe. Only we are standing by your side, alright. Now, it is up to you whether you want to change your statement repeatedly or not...),” DM Laxkar tells the victim's father according to the video on social media.A woman member of the family claimed they were being pressured by the district magistrate and feared “these people now won't let us live here”, according to another purported video shared by Rahul Gandhi.ग़रीब-दलित-आदिवासी की आवाज़ दबाओगे,सच कब तक छुपाओगे,और कितनी बेटियाँ चुपके-से जलाओगे?अब देश की आवाज़ रोक ना पाओगे!#JusticeForIndiasDaughters #HathrasHorror pic.twitter.com/r1Xbp8bqb9“Un logon ne mummy ke ulte seedhe video bana rakhe hain, us time haalat aise the ke jiske jo mu mein aa raha tha wo hum log bole ja rahe the... ab ye log humein yahan rehne nahi denge.

It is headed by General Bipin Rawat, who is the CDS as well as the DMA’s Secretary.The HQIDS was raised on October 1, 2001, as a tri-service entity with an overarching aim of “victory through jointness”.Singh said HQIDS has lent full support in raising the DMA from January 1, 2020, onwards by providing personnel and material.In addition to the Department of Defence, all the three service headquarters have “positively ensured” that the newly raised DMA stands on a “strong base”, Singh noted.“Secretary DMA and Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) is working in close cooperation with the other three service headquarters. Efforts are ongoing for the restructuring of the forces for optimum utilization of resources,” Singh told reporters.To promote indigenous production, the Defence Ministry on August 9 announced restrictions on import of 101 weapons and military platforms including light combat helicopters, conventional submarines and cruise missiles under a staggered timeline till 2024.“The Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India) in defence is one of the flagship programmes and all three services are looking at it very positively,” Singh mentioned.He said recent reforms announced for Atmanirbhar Bharat in defence sector will take India a long way.“Many procedures have been streamlined as per modern day requirements of the armed forces. Synergy is being maintained within the Ministry of Defence and other government of India’s ministries and departments,” he stated.“Department of Defence Production is providing the lead to the services and the DMA is coordinating valuable input of all three services,” he added.On August 9, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the ministry was now ready for a “big push” to indigenous defence manufacturing in tune with Prime Minister Narendra Modi”s call for an “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (Self-Reliant India). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/efforts-ongoing-to-restructure-armed-forces-for-optimum-utlilisation-of-resources-top-ids-official-149448
01-10-2020||Lucknow||Replace UP chief minister or impose president’s rule, demands Mayawati||Raising questions over the law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh, BSP chief Mayawati on Thursday demanded that either the state’s chief minister be replaced or the president’s rule imposed. Referring to deaths of two women in Hathras and Balrampur regions of the state, she said the incidents are reminiscent of the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder in Delhi.“In the wake of the law and order situation in the state and a flood of crimes against women, the Union government should replace Yogi Adityanath with some ‘kaabil’ (capable) person and if this is not possible, the president’s rule should be imposed in the state,” Mayawati said.“I want to say to Yogi Adityanath that you are born from the womb of a woman. You should consider sisters and daughters of others as your own. If you are unable to protect them, you should resign,” she asserted.A 22-year-old Dalit woman had died in Uttar Pradesh’s Balrampur district on Tuesday after allegedly being raped by two men. She succumbed to her injuries on the day the Hathras woman died in a Delhi hospital, two weeks after she was allegedly gang-raped. Both were cremated on Wednesday.Mayawati said the Yogi Adityanath government was not waking up despite continuous atrocities against women in the state.“I want to tell the government that it would be better if Yogi Adityanath sits at his original place in Gorakhpur Math. If he does not like the Gorakhpur Math, he should be handed over the task of constructing the Ram temple in Ayodhya,” she said. “In place of him (Adityanath), make a ‘kaabil’ (capable) man the chief minister who can give good law and order to people,” she said.“If the BJP high command cannot do this, then they should have a little mercy on the people of UP and improve the law and order situation by imposing the president’s rule in the state,” she added.Reacting to the BSP leader’s statement, state government spokesperson and Cabinet Minister Siddharth Nath Singh said, “Mayawati ji you become the leader of Scheduled Castes but you forgot that during your tenure a thousand Dalits were killed; and today you are giving us a lecture.”       He said, “If you raise one finger at us, two will rise against you. This is your political journey. This is your approach and this is the principle.”   When asked about Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi’s plans to visit Hathras, he said, “Why are they not going to Rajasthan? Will Sonia Gandhi, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra not give answers on what is happening in Rajasthan,” he said, adding that they wanted to “play politics” over the Hathras incident.

I have already started talking to farmers organisations to clear misgivings and misconceptions,” he said.“I want to assure farmers that the MSP will stay and rather it will be continuously raised in coming years,” he said.The new laws have come into effect after the passage of three key farm bills in the recently concluded monsoon session of Parliament.The government presented these bills as pro-farmers, saying these will ensure that farmers get better prices for their produce and do not get subjected to regulations of ‘mandis’. It has also said that farmers will be now free to sell their produce to anyone and these legislations will increase competition and promote private investment, which will help in the development of farm infrastructure and generate employment.However, opposition parties have slammed the bills as “anti-farmers”, claiming that the agriculture sector will be left to the fate of corporate interests. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/msp-will-be-hiked-continuously-in-coming-years-rajnath-singh-149441

He later asked his brother Rajeev to drop her at the bus-stand, police said.However, Rajeev who took her on his motorcycle went straight to a deserted area at Udayanur near Palladam, about 40 km from here, and called his five friends, they said.The six then sexually assaulted and fled with her money and mobile phone, the woman said in her complaint.Rajeev, Anbu and Kavin have been arrested and search is on for three others, police said.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/three-of-six-people-who-raped-an-assam-woman-arrested-149439
01-10-2020||Washington||US Congressional report accuses China of violating other nations’ sovereignty, seeks decisive action||A US Congressional report has sought decisive action against China, accusing Beijing of increasing military buildup, violating other nations’ sovereignty and engaging in fatal skirmishes to conduct a land-grab on the Indian border.In its report unveiled on Wednesday, the China Task Force of the House Republicans also supported the proposal of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the creation of a new D-10 group of leading democracies, including India, for addressing both 5G mobile communications and vulnerable supply chains.In just the past year alone, the China Communist Party (CCP) has violated an international treaty and dismantled Hong Kong’s civil liberties; continued its oppression of ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs and Tibetans; increased its military buildup, conducted increasingly belligerent provocations, and violated other nations’ sovereignty at sea; engaged in fatal skirmishes to conduct a land-grab on the Indian border; and asserted new territorial claims over Bhutan, the report said.India and China are locked in a nearly five-month-long border standoff in eastern Ladakh. China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong lake in the last week of August.China has been fast expanding military and economic influence in the Indo-Pacific region, triggering concern in various countries of the region and beyond.China is also engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the resource-rich region.China claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims over the area.Praising the State Department’s July 2020 statement which said that China’s territorial aggression in the South China Sea is illegal, the report said that the administration could take similar action regarding the CCP’s illegal conduct in other areas, including around the Senkaku Islands and along India’s border.The US, it said, should improve predictability of arms sales with allies and partners, and expand military training with allied and partner nations.Doing so will improve interoperability with the US, support and protect American values, advance US national security and foreign policy interests, and promote the US as the partner of choice, it said.It suggested more than 400 policy recommendations to address issues ranging from national security concerns, human rights violations, problems with the supply chain and China’s overall expanding influence on the world stage.It pushed for coordinating a whole-of-government offensive information statecraft campaign to counter the propaganda machine of ruling Chinese Communist Party by using truth and American values to undermine CCP’s “lies and malign” ideology.Further, the US should expand forward presence and improve interoperability with allies and partner nations through the use of joint training and exercises, including by bringing together and regularising multilateral exercises with like-minded nations such as Australia, Japan, India, and other interested nations, the report said.Supporting Johnson’s proposal for creating D-10 group of leading democracies (the current G-7 members, plus South Korea, India, and Australia), it said the US should work with the UK and other nations in  leveraging technical expertise of each nation in emerging technologies for the benefit of democratic countries.“The US should work with the UK and other nations to form a new D-10 group of leading democracies focused on developing and deploying 5G and subsequent generations, addressing 5G mobile communications and vulnerable supply chains, and leveraging technical expertise of each nation in emerging technologies for the benefit of democratic nations,” it said.The China Task Force, comprised of 15 House Republicans representing 11 committees, including several Armed Services Members, was formed in May to assess the threat of China and come up with legislative solutions on how to combat the risks. In compiling its recommendations, the Task Force heard from 130 experts, including policy experts, business leaders, and Members of Congress.“China presents a unique challenge to America’s interests and security. Confronting China will take a whole of government approach. We cannot rely on the military or on our diplomats alone; Congress also has an important role,” said Congress Mac Thornberry, ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee.House Minority Leader, Kevin McCarthy, told reporters at a news conference that it is not only the most thorough report on China in the history of the House; it is bold, achievable, and bipartisan. It doesn’t just lay out the challenges; it lays out the solutions and legislative reform.“One-third of these solutions have already either passed the House or the Senate. We need to make them become law,” he said.Congressman Michael McCaul said for decades the US and its allies have been asleep at the wheel until COVID-19 to countering the CCP’s 100-year marathon for global and military dominance. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-congressional-report-accuses-china-of-violating-other-nations-sovereignty-seeks-decisive-action-149438
01-10-2020||New Delhi||Gene mutation behind different COVID-19 death rates among Indian states, study finds||Variation in a genetic mutation among Indians may be the main reason behind the difference in the death rates due to COVID-19 across various states of the country, says a study that could inform new policies for controlling the novel coronavirus pandemic.An international team, led by researchers at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in Uttar Pradesh, analysed mutations in the gene responsible for the expression of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein on the surface of cells which is believed to act as a gateway for the novel coronavirus into the human body.Recent studies have effectively demonstrated that the ACE2 is encoded by a gene located on the X chromosome.In the journal Frontiers in Genetics, the researchers looked at the frequency of this mutation described as rs2285666 haplotype among various states of India.Their spatial analysis showed that in India, frequency of this haplotype, or a combination of mutations, varied between 33-100 per cent across different regions.The researchers, for the first time, also ascertained a significant positive correlation for the mutation with the lower infection and case-fatality ratio (CFR) among Indian populations.Gyaneshwer Chaubey, Professor at the Department of Zoology, BHU said the variations identified reduce the susceptibility of a person against the novel coronavirus."If in a region more people with this haplotype will be present, the infectiousness of the virus would likely be lesser," Chaubey, who led the study, told PTI.For example, he noted that statewise Maharashtra and Gujarat have the lowest frequency of the gene mutation of about 30-40 per cent while the Northeastern region with a 75-100 per cent mutation in the gene has the highest frequency."People in Western India are more susceptible to the disease than those in Central India or East India or South India or Northeast India," Chaubey added.The study adds important potential implications to understanding the transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in various world populations, said Anshika Srivastava from BHU, who was also a part of the research team.The researchers noted that as far as policies to control the pandemic are concerned, the study suggests a single rule may not be effective in all the states.They also observed that in India as well as in Bangladesh, the tribal populations have a higher frequency of this haplotype than the caste populations."If we look at casts vs tribals, tribals have higher frequency than the caste groups," said Chaubey, adding it is likely that the tribal populations will be less susceptible than the caste populations to the viral disease.Additionally, he noted that the virus strains present in India may also be responsible to contribute to the higher death rates, adding that the team is working on the infectiousness of various virus strains present in India in an ongoing study.Since the beginning, it has been hypothesised, and later observed that coronavirus is affecting people differently.In their previous research, published in the journal PLOS ONE, the team analysed the whole genome data of the ACE2 gene from various world populations, focusing on South Asia.They found that Indians were more closer to East and Southeast Asians, whereas from the ancestry point of view, Indians usually remained closer to Europeans than East and Southeast Asians."This unexpected info helped us to explore more about the mutations and haplotypes present among Indians. We found out that the rs2285666 associated haplotype increases the ACE2 expression," he said."In other words this mutation reduces the susceptibility against coronavirus," said Chaubey.Noting that the mutation among Indians is 60 per cent and 20 per cent in Europeans, Chaubey said this implies that the Indians are less susceptible to COVID-19 than Europeans and Americans."Surprisingly, we found out that the geographic distribution of this haplotype was highly correlated with the number of cases as well as CFR (death rate)," said Chaubey."Where frequency of this genetic factor was high, the cases and CFR were less and vice versa," he noted.Although data have been accumulating, the expression of ACE2 gene variation affecting host susceptibility among the various world populations is not yet known."Genetically, most South Asians are more related with West Eurasian populations rather than with East Eurasians, whereas for this gene the result is contradictory," Professor George van Driem of University of Bern in Switzerland, a co-author on the previous study, added.The researchers said there are a few studies on the ACE2 gene by other groups, but all of them have looked at the frequency differences of various mutations, whereas the team has used more powerful haplotype based analysis.

Now, a Mumbai-based company wants to convert this ship into a museum. Since they are also doing it out of patriotism, I agreed to sell the ship to them," he said."But, they need to first procure NOC from the defence ministry, without which I can't re-sell the ship," he said.Patel also said he first demanded Rs 125 crore and then agreed to sell it for Rs 100 crore considering that the company's cause is noble.Patel also said it is a limited period offer and he would wait only till next week."I am told the interested firm is trying hard to get the NOC. But, I can't wait forever. I will wait for another week. After that, I will start the dismantling process," he added.V K Sharma, the managing director of Envitech Marine Consultants Pvt Ltd, has shown interest in buying the warship.He had earlier expressed confidence of getting a NOC from the Centre so that INS Viraat can be converted into a museum.Sharma had claimed he received support from the Goa government in this patriotic endeavour."We are trying our best to get the NOC and we are confident of getting it soon. I had personally met Mukeshbhai and we both agreed on a price of the ship," Sharma said.Viraat, the world's longest-serving warship that was decommissioned by the Indian Navy three years ago, arrived at Alang in Gujarat from Mumbai last week for dismantling.It is the second aircraft carrier slated to be broken down in India. In 2014, INS Vikrant was dismantled in Mumbai.The 70-year-old aircraft carrier, in its earlier avatar, had won the Falklands War against Argentina in 1982 for the Royal British Navy.It weighs about 27,800 tonnes and served the British Navy as HMS Hermes from November 1959 to April 1984 and after refurbishment, was commissioned into the Indian Navy in 1987.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ready-to-sell-viraat-for-rs-100-cr-if-co-gets-noc-firm-149423

01-10-2020||New Delhi||PM to inaugurate strategic Atal Tunnel at Rohtang on Saturday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the strategically important all-weather Atal Tunnel, which reduces the distance between Manali and Leh by 46 km and the travel time by four to five hours, at Rohtang in Himachal Pradesh on Saturday. After the inauguration function, Modi will also attend public functions at Sissu in Lahaul Spiti and at Solang Valley, the Prime Minister's Office said on Thursday. Atal Tunnel is the longest highway tunnel in the world, and the 9.02 km long tunnel connects Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley throughout the year, the PMO said, noting that the valley was earlier cut off for about six months every year due to heavy snowfall.The tunnel is built with ultra-modern specifications in the Pir Panjal range of the Himalayas at an altitude of 3000 metres (10,000 feet) from the Mean Sea Level (MSL).The south portal (SP) of Atal Tunnel is located at a distance of 25 km from Manali at an altitude of 3,060 metres, while the north portal (NP) of the tunnel is located near village Teling, Sissu, in Lahaul Valley at an altitude of 3,071 metres. It is a horse shoe shaped, single-tube double lane tunnel with a roadway of 8 metres and has an overhead clearance of 5.525 metres, the PMO said.  Atal Tunnel has been designed for traffic density of 3000 cars per day and 1,500 trucks per day with max speed of 80 kmph. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had taken the decision to construct the strategic tunnel below the Rohtang Pass on June 3, 2000, and the foundation stone for the access road to the south portal of the tunnel was laid on May 26, 2002.The Modi government decided to name the Rohtang Tunnel as Atal Tunnel in December 2019 to honour the former prime minister who had passed away the previous year. The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) worked relentlessly to overcome major geological, terrain and weather challenges that included the most difficult stretch of the 587-metre Seri Nalah Fault Zone. The breakthrough from both ends was achieved on October 15, 2017, the statement said.

They are now headed back towards Delhi escorted by the UP police, they said.Rahul Gandhi also fell down in the scuffle after police tried to stop him and his supporters from proceeding on the Yamuna Expressway near the Jewar toll plaza. Pictures of the incident were shared by the party.The Congress had said that the Gandhis were arrested by the police.Later Rahul Gandhi told the media: “Just now police pushed me, lathicharged me and threw me on the ground. I want to ask, can only (Narendra) Modiji walk in this country? Can’t a normal person walk? Our vehicle was stopped, so we started walking.”The Uttar Pradesh police personnel also told Gandhi he was being detained as he was marching in an area where Section 144 has been imposed. The section relates to the assembly of not more than five people at one place.Gandhi said even if Section 144 had been imposed, he would walk alone towards Hathras to meet the family of the rape victim.According to Ranvijay Singh, Additional DCP, Gautam Budh Nagar, Rahul Gandhi has been taken into custody and he won't be allowed to go further as the police have a letter from DM Hathras saying that if Gandhi goes there, it may disturb the law and order situation in the district.Vehicles of Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were stopped in Uttar Pradesh’s Greater Noida on Thursday, party officials said.Rahul and Priyanka started walking to Hathras after Uttar Pradesh police stopped their vehicles. The convoy was stopped near Pari Chowk, prompting party workers and senior leaders to proceed on foot, with some functionaries saying they will walk down to Hathras.“Around the same time last year, we were fighting for the Unnao daughter and the situation in UP has not changed in a year,” Priyanka Gandhi told reporters as she started walking on the expressway.Vadra, in a tweet, said the family had been detained and was not being allowed to talk to anyone. Posting a video of the victim’s father, Vadra said the family was being forced to fall in line.हाथरस की बेटी के पिता का बयान सुनिए।उन्हें जबरदस्ती ले जाया गया। सीएम से वीसी के नाम पर बस दबाव डाला गया। वो जांच की कार्रवाई से संतुष्ट नहीं हैं।अभी पूरे परिवार को नजरबंद रखा है। बात करने पर मना है।क्या धमकाकर उन्हें चुप कराना चाहती है सरकार?अन्याय पर अन्याय हो रहा है। pic.twitter.com/6lIW1hdvDc  “Will the Uttar Pradesh government intimidate people into silence? The video conference call the father had with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was a farce and meant to simply exert pressure on the family. The victim’s family is not satisfied with the investigations. Injustice is all pervasive,” Vadra said.Priyanka said her party would continue to fight till women’s safety is ensured in Uttar Pradesh and unless the government was shaken and woken up, it would not do anything on this front.Talking to reporters while walking on the Yamuna Expressway towards Hathras, she said Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath would have to take the responsibility for the alleged gangrape of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in the district and strict action should be taken against the perpetrators of the crime.The victim died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday.हाथरस जैसी वीभत्स घटना बलरामपुर में घटी। लड़की का बलात्कार कर पैर और कमर तोड़ दी गई। आजमगढ़, बागपत, बुलंदशहर में बच्चियों से दरिंदगी हुई।यूपी में फैले जंगलराज की हद नहीं। मार्केटिंग, भाषणों से कानून व्यवस्था नहीं चलती। ये मुख्यमंत्री की जवाबदेही का वक्त है। जनता को जवाब चाहिए।  “The Uttar Pradesh government, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath must take responsibility for women safety in the state and ensure atrocities against them are stopped,” she added.“Since our cars have been stopped, we will walk down to Hathras as we want to meet the victim’s family. We want to express our condolences to the family,” Priyanka Gandhi said.“He (Adityanath) would have to do something for women’s safety. We will continue to fight till the time he does something. The women in the entire state will fight as they realise that they are not safe and secure. Everyday such incidents are happening. As many as 11 rape cases are registered in Uttar Pradesh every day,” she said.हाथरस जाने से हमें रोका। राहुल जी के साथ हम सब पैदल निकले तो बारबार हमें रोका गया, बर्बर ढंग से लाठियाँ चलाईं। कई कार्यकर्ता घायल हैं। मगर हमारा इरादा पक्का है। एक अहंकारी सरकार की लाठियाँ हमें रोक नहीं सकतीं। काश यही लाठियाँ, यही पुलिस हाथरस की दलित बेटी की रक्षा में खड़ी होती। pic.twitter.com/lRq9kLSHJz  “Such cases are rising and the government is not doing anything. Unless we shake the government or wake them up, they will not do anything for women's safety,” she added.The Congress general secretary recalled that around the same time last year, her party was protesting for the Unnao rape victim.Taking on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh for “not allowing the family to cremate the victim’s body with honour”, she said: “You claim to be the protectors of the Hindu religion, we are Hindus but where has it been written that you cannot allow a father to lit the pyre of his daughter and not allow the family to cremate the victim? The incident was a big injustice. What the state government did after that was a bigger injustice.”Rahul and Vadra were accompanied by Congress media head Randeep Surjewala and General Secretary (Organisation) KC Venugopal to Hathras.दुख की घड़ी में अपनों को अकेला नहीं छोड़ा जाता।UP में जंगलराज का ये आलम है कि शोक में डूबे एक परिवार से मिलना भी सरकार को डरा देता है।इतना मत डरो, मुख्यमंत्री महोदय!  The FSL report has make it clear that the woman was not raped: UP Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar on Hathras case pic.twitter.com/lEyAWi3jIA  When asked about the prohibitory orders placed in Hathras ahead of the Congress leaders' visit, Surjewala told reporters at the DND: “Instead of stopping criminals, the Yogi Adityanath government is working on stopping Rahul and Priyanka and that is the question.” He also questioned the cremation of the woman in the dead of the night, saying it was against the Hindu traditions and was done without her family's involvement. Meanwhile, the state police have been deployed along the borders. — With PTI/IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-priyanka-detained-on-way-to-hathras-to-meet-gang-rape-victims-family-149403

01-10-2020||New Delhi||SC accepts DGCA scheme for refund for air tickets booked during lockdown||The Supreme Court on Thursday accepted the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) scheme for refund of money for air tickets booked during the COVID-19 lockdown.A three-judge Bench, headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, endorsed the DGCA credit shell scheme which will be valid till March 31 and disposed of petitions on refund of air tickets booked for/during the lockdown.The Bench said in cases where air tickets had been booked through agents, a refund will happen through them only.It directed the Ministry of Civil Aviation to issue the necessary notification in this regard.The verdict approving the DGCA scheme is likely to benefit thousands of air passengers whose hard-earned money remained stuck with airlines after their air tickets were cancelled due to the lockdown.The Supreme Court on September 25 reserved its orders on a PIL seeking a full refund for air tickets booked during the lockdown, after hearing counsel for petitioner Pravasi Legal Cell, various airlines, the Centre and the Directorate of Civil Aviation.On behalf of the Centre, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had clarified that credit shell i.e. voucher facility can't be availed by travel agents who booked tickets during the lockdown.Advocates representing airlines had talked about massive losses faced by them due to COVID-19 lockdown, while air travellers’ counsel had asserted that they can’t be made to suffer and their money has to be refunded.The DGCA had earlier told the top court that full refund shall be provided by airlines immediately for tickets booked during the COVID-19 lockdown for domestic or international travel within the lockdown period.If airlines were not able to refund on account of financial distress, they shall provide a credit shell equal to the amount of fare collected and this shall be issued in the name of the passenger who has booked the ticket for domestic travel directly or through an agent, including online platforms, the DGCA had said.Passengers entitled to a full refund for air tickets booked during Lockdown 1 & 2 during which air travel was banned due to COVID-19 pandemic, the Centre had earlier told the Supreme Court.“If the tickets have been booked during the first lockdown period, i.e. 25th of March, 2020 to 14th of April, 2020 for the journeys to be undertaken in both first and second lockdown period i.e. from 25th of March, 2020 to 3rd of May, 2020, in all such cases, a full refund shall be given by the airlines immediately,” the Directorate General of Civil Aviation had said regarding domestic airlines’ tickets booked directly by the passenger with airlines.Similarly, for international travel when the ticket has been booked on an Indian carrier and the booking is ex-India, it had said, “If the tickets have been booked during the lockdown period for travel within the lockdown period, in all such cases full refund shall be given by the airlines immediately. This amount shall be passed on immediately by the Agent to the passengers, as the case may be.”SC's directions in air tickets refund case:1. If a passenger has booked a ticket during the lockdown period (from 25th March, 2020 to 24th May, 2020) for travel during lockdown period and the airline has received payment for booking of air ticket for travel during the same period, for both domestic and international air travel and the refund is sought by the passenger against that booking being cancelled, the airline shall refund the full amount collected without any cancellation charges. The refund shall be made within a period of three weeks from the date of cancellation.2. If the tickets have been booked during the lockdown period through a travel agent for a travel within the lockdown period, in all such cases full refund shall be given by the airlines immediately. On such refund, the amount shall be passed on immediately by the agent to the passengers.3. Passengers who booked tickets at any period of time but for travel after 24th May, 2020 – refund of fares to the passengers covered under this category shall be governed by the provisions of Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR).4. Even for international travel, when the tickets have been booked on an Indian carrier and the booking is exIndia, if the tickets have been booked during the lockdown period for travel within the lockdown period, immediate refund shall be made.5. If the tickets are booked for international travel on a foreign carrier and the booking is exIndia during the lockdown period for travel within the lockdown period, full refund shall be given by the airlines and said amount shall be passed on immediately by the agent to the passengers, wherever such tickets are booked through agents. In all other cases airline shall refund the collected amount to the passenger within a period of three weeks.6. In all other cases, the airlines shall make all endeavours to refund the collected amount to the passenger within 15 days from today. If on account of financial distress, any airline / airlines are not able to do so, they shall provide credit shell, equal to the amount of fare collected, in the name of passenger when the booking is done either directly by the passenger or through travel agent so as to consume the same on or before 31st March, 2021. It is open to the passenger either to utilize such credit shell upto 31st March, 2021 on any route of his choice or the passenger can transfer the credit shell to any person including the travel agent through whom he /she has booked the ticket and the airlines shall honour such a transfer.7. The credit shell issued in the name of the passenger shall be transferable which can be utilized upto 31st March, 2021 and the concerned airline shall honour such a transfer by devising a mechanism to facilitate such a transfer. It is also made clear that such credit shell can be utilized by the concerned agent through whom the ticket is booked, for third party use. It is also made clear that even in cases where credit shell is transferred to third party, same is to be utilized only through the agent who has booked the ticket at the first instance.8. In cases where passengers have purchased the ticket through an agent, and credit shell is issued in the name of passenger, such credit shell is to be utilized only through the agent who has booked the ticket. In cases where tickets are booked through agent, credit shell as issued in the name of the passenger which is not utilized by 31st March, 2021, refund of the fare collected shall be made to the same account from which account amount was received by the airline.9. In all cases where credit shell is issued there shall be an incentive to compensate the passenger from the date of cancellation upto 30th June, 2020 in which event the credit shell shall be enhanced by 0.5% of the face value (the amount of fare collected) for every month or part thereof between the date of cancellation and 30th June, 2020. Thereafter the value of the credit shell shall be enhanced by 0.75% of the face value per month upto 31st March, 2021.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-accepts-dgca-scheme-for-refund-for-air-tickets-booked-during-lockdown-149377

On her way back, three-four persons abducted her, took her to their room, gave her an injection and raped her. They later sent her back on an e-rickshaw, which dumped her outside our house. They broke her legs and back, she could not stand or talk," the victim's mother said.Quoting the victim's family members, Balrampur Superintendent of Police (SP) Dev Ranjan Verma said the woman, who worked in a private firm, returned home in a serious condition on Tuesday.She looked dazed and had an intravascular cannula, medically known as Vigo and used for administering an injection or other fluids in the body, inserted in her hands.She was rushed to a nearby hospital, but died on the way, the SP said.When the matter was reported to the police by the hospital, her parents alleged that she was gangraped, he added.Acting on her parent's complaint, the police identified the accused as Shahid and Sahil and arrested them, the SP said.About the reports that the victim's legs and back were broken, he said, "It was not confirmed in the post-mortem. We contradict this news." The victim was cremated on Wednesday after the post-mortem in the presence of her family members, the police said.The district magistrate and the SP, along with the mahant of the Devipatan temple, Mithilesh Nath Yogi, visited the victim's house on Thursday morning, met the family members and condoled her death."The family members were assured that the accused will be given a strict punishment in accordance with law. A letter sanctioning a financial assistance of Rs 6,18,450 was handed over to them by the mahant. The amount will be sent to the victim's mother's bank account by the afternoon," a statement issued here said. Meanwhile, the victim's mother has demanded a compensation of Rs 25 lakh and a government job for her son."My daughter wanted to become a lawyer but she was killed. The same fate should await the culprits. We want justice. My son should be given a government job and we should get at least Rs 25 lakh as compensation," she said.Reacting to the incident, Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav wrote on his Twitter handle on Wednesday night: "After Hathras, now a daughter was harassed and gang-raped in Balrampur. The victim died in serious condition. Condolences!""The BJP government should commit no laxity in this case as was done in Hathras and arrest the accused immediately," he added with hashtags #Balrampur and #NoMoreBJP.The Balrampur incident comes at a time when there is a nationwide outrage over the Hathras gangrape.A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14 and referred to the Safdarjung hospital in Delhi on Monday with spinal cord injuries, paralysis and cuts in her tongue. She died at around 3 am on Tuesday. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-hathras-another-gang-rape-victim-dies-in-ups-balrampur-2-held-149353
01-10-2020||New Delhi||Largest contact tracing study in India shows Covid transmitted mainly by ‘superspreaders’||The transmission of COVID-19 in India has been driven mainly by “superspreaders” or a small percentage of infected people, according to the largest contact tracing study in the country which also shows that children are key to the spread of the novel coronavirus.The researchers, including those from the Government of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, found that over 70 per cent of COVID-19 infected patients in the country did not infect any of their contacts, while 8 per cent of infected individuals accounted for 60 per cent of observed new infections.The study of over half-million people in India found that both cases and deaths due to the disease had been more heavily concentrated in the 40 to 69-year age group than is seen in high-income countries, among other trends.The researchers also found a high prevalence of infection among children who were contacts of other cases around their own age.The study, published in the journal Science on Wednesday, assessed the disease transmission patterns in 5,75,071 individuals exposed to 84,965 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the two states based on data collected by tens of thousands of contact tracers.According to the scientists, including Ramanan Laxminarayan from the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, New Delhi, the findings offer a peek into the pandemic’s trajectory in a low and middle-income country, where most COVID-19 cases have occurred.Based on the data, the scientists said both cases and deaths in the two Indian states were concentrated in younger cohorts than expected from observations in higher-income countries.The study noted that contacts with the same age were associated with the greatest infection risk — a pattern, which the researchers said, was strongest among children between 0 to 14 years of age and among adults older than 65 years.They said the proportion of deaths to the number of infected people, known as the case-fatality ratio (CFR), spanned 0.05 per cent at ages 5 to 17 years to 16.6 per cent at ages exceeding 85.The researchers also noted that COVID-19 patients in the two states had a median stay of five days in the hospital before death compared to 13 days to death from the date of hospital admission in the US.Follow-up testing of exposed contacts revealed that 70 per cent of infected individuals did not infect any of their contacts while 8 per cent of coronavirus positive patients accounted for 60 per cent of observed new infections.The researchers said this finding presented the largest empirical demonstration of superspreading, which is when an unusually large number of individuals were infected by a few other people.They said the findings “may indicate the identification of less-severe infections through active case-finding”.“Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are among the Indian states with the largest healthcare workforce and public health expenditures per capita and are known for their effective primary healthcare delivery models,” the study noted.It said 63 per cent of those who died had at least one comorbidity and 36 per cent had two or more underlying health conditions that made them more susceptible to the disease.About 45 per cent of those who died were diabetic, the scientists said.Unlike observations in high-income countries, they said the deaths in India were concentrated at ages 50 to 64 years. In the two Indian states in particular, they said only 17.9 per cent of COVID-19 deaths occurring on or before August 1, 2020, were among people older than 75, compared with 58.1 per cent of deaths due to the disease in the US.“This study was made possible by the significant contact tracing effort in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, which involved tens of thousands of healthcare workers,” Laxminarayan said.“The results on disease transmission and mortality have the potential to inform policy to fight COVID-19. The study also speaks to the capacity of research emerging from India to help inform the global response to COVID-19,” he added.

01-10-2020||Washington||Legislation introduced to boost India-US clean energy and climate cooperation||A top Democratic senator on Wednesday introduced a legislation in the US Senate to establish a forum for bilateral cooperation with India on clean energy technologies and energy transmission.Introduced by Senator Robert Menendez, a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Prioritizing Clean Energy and Climate Cooperation with India Act establishes the United States-India Clean Energy and Power Transmission Partnership (CEPTP) as the main forum for cooperation between the two nations on clean energy technologies and energy transmission.The activities under the CEPTP include promoting joint research and development on clean energy technologies, encouraging US private investment in the Indian clean energy market and supporting initiatives to develop new and renewable energy generation capacity in India.The legislation also promotes US-India cooperation on climate resilience and risk reduction, a statement said.“Given the shared threat of climate change and India's growing need for electricity, there is a strong case to be made for strengthening the US-India clean energy partnership,” said Menendez.“In that vein, I am introducing this legislation having witnessed firsthand the positive results that come when our nations work as a team to tackle common challenges,” he said.Menendez was part of a congressional delegation to India in the fall of 2019, during which he engaged with India's minister of New and Renewable Energy and Indian business leaders to discuss how the US and India can address the threat of climate change and deepen cooperation on clean energy production.“By establishing the US-India Clean Energy and Power Transmission Partnership, we are laying the groundwork for successful partnerships between not only the US and Indian governments, but also our universities and private sectors. I am proud to lead this effort to further strengthen our relationship with India,” Menendez said.The legislation also seeks to promote lawful sharing of intellectual property between US and Indian private sector entities for renewable energy technology, air conditioning technology, and refrigeration systems technology.

01-10-2020||United Nations||Covid crisis emphasised importance of living in harmony with nature: Javadekar||The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasised the fact that unregulated exploitation of natural resources coupled with unsustainable food habits and consumption pattern lead to destruction of system that supports human life, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said.Addressing the UN Biodiversity Summit held virtually on Wednesday, Javadekar said India had been championing the cause of climate action through conservation, sustainable lifestyle and green development model.“Since time immemorial, India has a culture of not just conserving and protecting nature, but living in harmony with nature. The emergence of COVID-19 has emphasised the fact that unregulated exploitation of natural resources coupled with unsustainable food habits and consumption pattern lead to destruction of system that supports human life,” he said."On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the UN and the start of the ‘UN Decade of Action and Delivery for Sustainable Development', let’s join our efforts to put nature on a path to recovery and realise the vision of ‘living in harmony with nature'," he said.A record number of countries - nearly 150 countries and 72 Heads of State and Government - addressed the first-ever summit held on biodiversity to build political momentum towards the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, to be adopted at COP15 in Kunming, China, next year.The summit comes on the heels of the Leader's Pledge on Monday, which saw 74 countries commit to preserving biodiversity, sending “a united signal to step up global ambition for biodiversity and to commit to matching our collective ambition for nature, climate and people with the scale of the crisis at hand”.Javadekar said that inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, the ethos of non-violence and protection of animals and nature have been suitably enshrined in the Constitution of India and is reflected in several laws and legislations.“It is due to these beliefs and ethos that India, with only 2.4 per cent of the earth's land area hosts around 8 per cent of the world's recorded species,” he said.Javadekar told the summit that India aims to restore 26 million hectares of degraded and deforested land, and achieve land-degradation neutrality by 2030. “This is a target which shows our ambition,” he said.Further, he said that in the course of last decade, India has enhanced the combined forest and tree cover to 24.56 per cent of the total geographical area of the country.India also now has the highest number of tigers in the wild and have doubled its numbers ahead of the deadline of 2022 and recently announced the launch of Project Lion and Project Dolphin.“As enshrined in our Vedic scripts ‘Prakriti Rakshati Rakshita' - that is if you protect nature, nature will protect you,” he said.India has also operationalised a system for access and benefit-sharing provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity through a national network of 250,000 Biodiversity Management Committees across the country involving local people and 170,000 Peoples Biodiversity Registers for documentation of biodiversity.The post-2020 global biodiversity framework that will be adopted at the 15th Conference of Parties to the CBD in 2021 provides a good opportunity to enhance efforts to conserve and protect nature, he said.

01-10-2020|| & PTINew Delhi/Lucknow||All 32 accused in Babri case acquitted||A special CBI court here on Wednesday acquitted all the 32 accused, including senior BJP leaders LK Advani, MM Joshi, Kalyan Singh and Uma Bharti, in the Babri Masjid demolition case, saying there was no conclusive evidence against them.Read also: In his 2,300-page verdict, Special Judge SK Yadav said the CBI could not produce any conclusive proof against the accused. The verdict, which came 28 years after the demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992, by kar sevaks, noted that late VHP leader Ashok Singhal wanted to save the structure because Lord Ram idol was inside.The court’s findings are at variance with those of Justice MS Liberhan Commission, which had concluded in its 2009 report that the masjid demolition was planned and systematic. The demolition had triggered riots that claimed nearly 2,000 lives across India. The acquittal of senior BJP leaders comes less than a year after a five-judge Bench led by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi on November 9, 2019, decided the Ayodhya title dispute and ruled in favour of Ram Lala, paving the way for construction of Ram Temple.When Special Judge Yadav entered the courtroom at 12.10 pm, 26 of the 32 accused were present along with their lawyers. As the judge pronounced acquittal of all the accused, some of them shouted “Jai Shri Ram”.Asked if the probe agency will challenge the verdict in the high court, CBI counsel Lalit Singh told reporters a copy of the judgment would be sent to CBI headquarters and further decision would be taken after perusal of the verdict.The judge refused to accept newspaper reports and photos as evidence as their originals and negatives weren’t produced and videos weren’t clear enough to be relied upon.The 32 accused include former Deputy PM Advani, former Union ministers Joshi and Bharti, former UP CM Kalyan Singh during whose tenure the structure was pulled down, besides VHP leaders Vinay Katiyar and Sadhvi Rithambara. Champat Rai, the general secretary of the trust in charge of constructing the temple, was also among the accused.Judge retires after verdictSpecial Judge SK Yadav, who had been given one-year extension till Wednesday by the SC, retired after pronouncing the judgment. The criminal conspiracy charge was dropped by a trial court in 2001.

01-10-2020||Chandigarh||Liberhan panel had indicted BJP top guns for ‘intolerance’||Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan, who probed the 1992 demolition of Babri mosque at Ayodhya, had indicted the perpetrators for having reduced “the oldest civilisation to stark intolerance and barbarianism, all for petty political gains”.2,000 lives were lost across India in the riots that followed the Babri demolitionIn his 1,029-page report, Justice Liberhan admonished senior BJP leaders, calling them “pseudo-moderates” and “icons” of the movement. “It cannot be assumed even for a moment that LK Advani, AB Vajpayee and MM Joshi did not know the designs of the Sangh Parivar,” said the one-man commission in its findings.The Liberhan Commission, set up by the PV Narasimha Rao government days after the Babri Masjid was demolished on December 6, 1992, submitted its report to the Centre in June 2009.“Unable to hold even these pseudo-moderates innocent of any wrongdoings…. This commission has no hesitation in condemning the pseudo-moderates for their sins of omission,” it said.The commission had also indicted Uma Bharti, Shankersinh Vaghela (has quit BJP), late party leaders Pramod Mahajan and Vijaya Raje Scindia, RSS ideologue K Govindacharya and Shiv Sena’s then chief late Bal Thackeray. Among the bureaucrats named in the report were then UP Principal Secretary (Home) Prabhat Kumar, IG (Security) AK Saran and Faizabad SSP DB Roy.“(Then CM) Kalyan Singh entered into a ‘joint common enterprise’ for the purpose of demolition of the disputed structure. This was (either) to construct or… show to kar sevaks that the Ram temple construction had been started by the government. This was essential for use in future elections,” the report said.“The police and the administration were openly supporting the RSS agenda. There was active and willing collusion between the state administration and the political executive… did not take even token steps to stop the demolition or control the mob.“The leaders saw the Ayodhya issue as their road to success and sped down this highway mindless of the casualties they scattered around. The BJP was and remains an appendage of the RSS, which had the purpose of only providing an acceptable veneer to the less popular decisions and a facade for the brash members of the Sangh Parivar,” the report noted.‘Events were not spontaneous’The court has decided the case according to its conscience and proof available to it. It stands beyond doubt that the events of the day were neither spontaneous, nor unplanned, nor an unforeseen overflowing of people’s emotion. No evidence, lead or information was provided to the commission with respect to the conspiracy. — Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan who headed probe panel||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/liberhan-panel-had-indicted-bjp-top-guns-for-intolerance-149163

Whatever had to happen happened on November 9 last year. This case should also have ended the same day. This is the CBI’s case and the court has given its ruling today. I appeal to Muslims not to take any further action on this. Just as they honoured the November 9 decision, this verdict too needs to be accepted similarly,” he said.Ansari said he did not want any dispute between Hindus and Muslims in the country. “Only those who want to break the country try to continue with disputes,” he added. — PTI‘It’s Travesty of justice’All charged with criminal conspiracy acquitted. It (mosque) imploded on its own? The SC Constitution Bench headed by then CJI had said the demolition was an egregious violation of law. Now this verdict! — Sitaram Yechury, CPM leader‘Only satisfies Hindutva ideology’This judgment satisfies the collective consciousness of Hindutva and its followers and its ideology.

01-10-2020||New Delhi||BJP looks to gain from verdict in Bihar Assembly poll||The acquittal of senior BJP leaders and Hindutva activists in the Babri mosque demolition case on Wednesday has come as a big boost to the saffron party, whose leaders have always insisted that the razing of the disputed structure in Ayodhya was a spontaneous act and not part of any conspiracy.With the party set to intensify its campaign for the Bihar Assembly poll, besides byelection to one Lok Sabha and 56 Assembly seats, the court verdict has again brought the emotive issue, which has animated political discourse for long, to the centre stage and given the BJP a handy plank.The special CBI court’s order effectively absolves the BJP of any responsibility from the most controversial aspect of the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and what the Supreme Court had described as an “egregious violation of the rule of law” in its last year verdict that handed over the disputed site in Ayodhya to pro-temple parties in that dispute.The court said there was no conclusive proof against the accused. The verdict will ensure that the BJP while owning up the movement’s success in ensuring the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya can legitimately disassociate itself with the demolition.It has also snatched a potent weapon from opposition parties, most of whom have targeted the BJP for the mosque’s fall while either refraining from criticising or even welcoming the temple’s construction.It was the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and Advani’s “Rath Yatra” in 1990 to mobile the masses in favour of building a temple at the disputed site, where believers hold that Lord Ram was born, that brought the issue to the center stage of national politics and helped the BJP emerge as an alternative to the Congress.As part of the movement, Hindutva organisations had brought a large number of “kar sevaks” at the site when the mosque was taken down by the mob.A BJP leader said the judgment has ensured that the Ram Janmabhoomi movement leaves behind a “proud legacy” for the party without having any dimension to it about which it might have felt defensive. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-looks-to-gain-from-verdict-in-bihar-assembly-poll-149165
