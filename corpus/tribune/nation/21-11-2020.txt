21-11-2020||---||G-20 seeks to coordinate Covid response||New Delhi, November 21A downsized version of the Group of 20 (G-20) summit began in virtual format in Riyadh on Saturday with an opening address by the King of Saudi Arabia Salman calling on the world’s most powerful leaders to make the forum relevant at a time when the global Covid pandemic shows no signs of abating.“It is our duty to rise to the challenge together during this summit and give a strong message of hope and reassurance,” he said in his opening address.Over the next two days, world leaders including PM Narendra Modi, Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Angela Merkel, Emmaunel Macron and Justin Trudeau are slated to address the virtual summit.The G-20 has agreed to suspend debt payments for the world’s poorest countries till the middle of next year but UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has asked it to extend debt repayments through the end of 2021 and also extend it to middle-income countries in need.The pandemic has especially hit the G-20 members hard. India has the second highest number of recorded Covid cases after the US. They are followed by co-members Brazil, France, Russia, Spain, the UK, Argentina and Italy. At least three of their leaders – Donald Trump, Boris Johnson and Jair Bolsonaro – were afflicted by Covid.Speaking against the backdrop of criticism that the G-20 hasn’t collectively done enough to combat the economic devastation caused by the pandemic, the King reminded the leaders that 12 years ago the G-20 was successful in combating the global financial meltdown.This was the common message by world leaders in video statements issued before the beginning of the virtual summit.“Our fates are in each other's hands,” said Johnson while calling on the G-20 to harness the combined resources of the nations to end the Covid pandemic and tackle climate change.Bolsonaro also said intra-G-20 co-operation was the key to overcoming the pandemic.The G-20 had quickly convened a summit in March this year after the pandemic had spread around the world. It had then agreed to share information, material and clinical data to strengthen their health systems as well as join hands to fund vaccine research.King Salman touched on the shortcoming by asking the leaders to “create the conditions for affordable and equitable access to these tools for all peoples”.In a message, Guterres called on more G-20 nations to join COVAX, an international initiative to distribute Covid vaccines to countries worldwide.Some members including the US have refused to join, with Trump citing the malign influence of the WHO and China as the reason.The pandemic has so far claimed nearly 14 lakh lives worldwide and provides a challenge to G20 to show international co-operation in a crisis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/g-20-seeks-to-coordinate-covid-response-173737

The 12-member team abused him and said that there was no place for the BJP in the university, it was alleged.The FIR of the incident was registered at the civil lines police station of Aligarh on the same day and, after an investigation, the police filed a charge sheet against the petitioners on January 23, 2020, which was challenged before the high court. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-rejects-petition-seeking-quashing-of-criminal-proceedings-against-amus-proctorial-team-members-173730

21-11-2020||New Delhi||World community should isolate nations that sponsor terrorism: Vice President||Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday called upon the world community to come together to isolate nations that sponsor terrorism and impose sanctions against them.Expressing concern over the scourge of terrorism, Naidu appealed to the United Nations (UN) to complete deliberations and adopt India's long-pending proposal of a 'Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism'.The Vice President made the remarks at a virtual event organised by Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management to present Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award for Excellence - 2020 to Sudha Murty, the chairperson of Infosys Foundation, for her philanthropic work.Observing that no country is safe from terrorism, he said the days of platitude were over and it was time for concrete action. "There is also a need to reform the UN and create a more inclusive and equitable world order," he said.Naidu stressed on the need for all nations, particularly those in South Asia, to come together to promote peace, eradicate poverty, improve socio-economic conditions of the masses and wipe out the menace of terrorism.Paying tributes to former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, Naidu said he was a great son of India who rose from a humble beginning to the pre-eminent position of Prime Minister and yet maintained simplicity, humility and humanitarian outlook."He displayed statesman-like dignity, impeccable integrity and served the nation without ever compromising on high moral values," said the Vice President.Highlighting one of the important aspects of Shastri's personality, Naidu said that he had the remarkable ability to communicate effectively and negotiate skillfully."One of the secrets of his extraordinary success as a negotiator was his ability to see the other man's point of view. He was always ready to make maximum allowance for another person's feelings," Naidu recalled.Referring to the coronavirus pandemic, Naidu complimented frontline warriors from various fields."In spite of the restrictions during the lockdown, our farmers acted as frontline warriors and rose to the occasion to produce enough food grains. Unmindful of the risk to their lives, doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, security forces, sanitation workers and media personnel too have been working with dedication in these testing times," he said.

Besides, clear skies in the day is causing the heat to dissipate quickly and make the nights cooler than usual," Srivastava explained.However, he also forecast that the temperature is expected to rise in the next three-four days before dropping again after November 27. "Western disturbance and change in wind direction will cause the rise in temperature," Srivastava added.The minimum temperature in the national capital had dropped to 7.5 degrees Celsius on Friday morning, five notches below normal for this time of the year.On Thursday, the city had recorded a minimum temperature of 9.4-degree C. In 2017, the minimum temperature had dipped to 7.6-degree C in the last week of November. IMD data showed that the average normal minimum temperature is 12.9-degree C for this time of the year. Delhi even saw its coldest October in 58 years this time with an average minimum temperature of 17.2-degree C.The lowest temperature recorded last November was 11.4-degree C, while in 2018 it was 10.5-degree C. The IMD is likely to declare a cold wave on Saturday if the temperature remains five degrees below normal.Meanwhile, the city's air quality index fell to the "poor" category on Saturday with a reading of 252. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the forecasting body under the Union Ministry of Earth Sciences, said that 1,264 fire counts were observed in the neighbouring states and the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM 2.5 is expected to be 13 per cent on Saturday. -- IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-temperature-may-dip-to-7-degree-c-on-sunday-lowest-in-14-years-173701

The Ministry should follow a transparent approach so that any irregularity in the approval or production of vaccine is avoided,” said the panel in its report today.It added that the Ministry should devise a plan for the availability of the vaccine and subsidise its cost for the weaker section especially in rural areas and urban slums. “The Ministry should be cautious in its efforts to check instances of black-marketing and shortage of vaccines. The Committee recommends the Ministry to administer the vaccines according to the WHO’s “strategic allocation” approach or a multi-tiered risk-based approach. Smart vaccination may be used as an immediate strategy but subsequently the whole population should be vaccinated,” the panel headed by SP’s Ram Gopal Yadav said, asking the centre to enhance cold chain storage system so that country wide vaccination can be carried out without any hurdles.In another major observation, the committee drew linkages between the COVID 19 causing Sars-Cov2 virus and a potential biological weapon asking the Centre to devise a strategy for ensuring safety against public health emergencies arising from bio weapons.“The Committee agrees with the Department of Health Research that a holistic approach is needed for ensuring bio-security against biological weapons. The Ministry should also engage with agencies and actively participate in ongoing International treaties.  The Committee strongly recommends the Ministry to conduct more research and work towards training and capacity building for management of public health emergencies arising from use of bio-weapons,” the panel said at a time when a global debate is raging around the origins of the virus and whether it is natural or manmade.The US has openly accused China of spreading the virus and the WHO has constituted a committee to review International Health Regulations in the light of the pandemic outbreak.While recommending Indian Health Service cadre to man public health emergencies the committee also asked the Centre to raise public spending on health research as a percentage of the GDP.“The Committee strongly recommends for higher investment on research and development and innovation on health research at multiple levels to contain zoonotic virals like COVID-19 and to establish One Health Surveillance System with potential warning system of microbial spill over. The Committee notes that India’s Gross domestic expenditure on research and development is well below the world average. As per recent UNESCO Institute of Statistics data, the US spends almost 2.84 per cent of its GDP on research and China spends 2.19 per cent whereas India spent 0.67 pc in 2017 and 0.65 pc in 2018,” said the panel asking to raise this percentage to at least the world average of 1.72 pc of the GDP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/whole-population-must-be-vaccinated-against-covid-parliamentary-panel-to-centre-173697

CBI officers had come to my house to issue summons, but we were not here as we were attending a personal event. Next day morning when I came home, they issued me summons," said Shivakumar.Speaking to reporters here, he said the CBI has asked him to appear on November 23 at 4 pm, but it will not be possible on that day as he along with Congress legislature party leader Siddaramaiah will be touring Maski and Basavakalyana Assembly constituencies, where  by-polls are likely to be announced soon."From tomorrow I will be touring Hospete (Ballari), Maski (Raichur), Basavakalyana (Bidar).

21-11-2020||Mumbai||Nashik boy cycles from Kashmir to Kanyakumari in 8 days, sets record||Om Mahajan will be turning 18 only next month, but he has already broken the record for the fastest bicycle journey across India.Mahajan, resident of Nashik in Maharashtra, covered the distance of 3,600 km from Srinagar to Kanyakumari on bicycle in eight days, seven hours and 38 minutes, finishing on Saturday afternoon.“I was always into cycling, but it was more about sprinting. I began to dream of endurance cycling and taking part in the Race Across America (RAAM) after lockdown began,” Om said, speaking to PTI minutes after reaching Kanyakumari.“About six months ago, I began training for the qualifier ride for RAAM which was to happen in November,” he said.But rather than going for the standard 600-km qualifier ride, Om set himself a ‘Race Across India’.He started from Srinagar on a chilly night last week, and braved heavy rains in Madhya Pradesh and punishing heat down south before reaching the destination.The existing Guinness Book record for the fastest bicycle ride from Srinagar to Kanyakumari is held by his uncle, Mahendra Mahajan.However, that record was recently broken by the Indian Army’s Lt Col Bharat Pannu, who cycled the distance in eight days and nine hours, though it was yet to be entered in Guinness Book.The younger Mahajan had set his eyes on Pannu’s record.“Sleep or even rest was a luxury,” he said, adding that riding in the cold was the toughest part.On Saturday, as news of Om’s accomplishment spread in the cyclist community on social media, Lt Col Pannu was quick to congratulate the 17-year-old.Om’s father Hitendra and uncle Mahendra had won the RAAM as a team of two in 2015. They also hold a record for the fastest ride along the Golden Quadrilateral.The pandemic delayed his departure to Kansas, US where he has enrolled for a graduate course in sports management, Om said. But it also gave him time to train.An experienced crew of cyclists including his father and uncle, as well as RAAM solo finisher Kabir Raichure accompanied him in a vehicle as his ‘support team’.“I only cycled the distance. A major part of the credit goes to the crew. This is our collective record,” Om said.His next challenge is RAAM, often described as the toughest cycle race on the planet. To finish it successfully, Om will have to ride 4,800 km within 12 days.But for now he can enjoy the luxury of taking in the sunset at Kanyakumari beach, without once looking at the watch. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nashik-boy-cycles-from-kashmir-to-kanyakumari-in-8-days-sets-record-173690
21-11-2020||Washington||Tibetan political leader visits White House for first time in 6 decades||The head of the Tibetan government in exile has visited the White House for the first time in six decades, the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) said on Saturday, a move that could further enrage Beijing, which has accused the US of trying to interfere in China’s internal affairs.Dr Lobsang Sangay entered the United States White House on Friday — a historic feat. This is the first time in the last 6 decades the head of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) has been invited into the White House, the CTA said in a statement.“It is a great honour to be the first political head of the Central Tibetan Administration to formally enter the White House,” Sangay said in a tweet.“Today’s visit amounts to an acknowledgement of both the democratic system of the CTA and its political head... This unprecedented meeting perhaps will set an optimistic tone for CTA participation with US officials and be more formalised in the coming years,” said the CTA, which is based in Dharamsala in India.Sangay, the President of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), was invited to the White House to meet the newly appointed US Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues, Robert Destro, on Friday, it said.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on October 15 named senior diplomat Destro as Special Coordinator for Tibetan issues, who, among other matters, would focus on advancing dialogue between the Communist government in China and the Dalai Lama.Announcing Destro’s appointment, Pompeo said it was consistent with the Tibetan Policy Act and he will lead the US efforts to promote dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama or his representatives; protect the unique religious, cultural and linguistic identity of Tibetans; and press for their human rights to be respected.China has criticised Destro’s appointment, saying it amounted to political manipulation aimed at destabilising Tibet.After Destro’s appointment, Sangay met him and discussed the situation in Tibet.Asked about the Destro-Sangay meeting, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here last month: “Xizang’s (Tibet’s) affairs (are) purely China’s internal affairs. No external forces shall interfere in them”.Unlike in the past, the Chinese officials in recent times have been referring to Tibet only as Xizang.“Appointing the so-called special coordinator for Tibetan issues is a political move to interfere in China’s internal affairs and sabotage Xizang’s stability. It is China’s consistent position we firmly oppose that and we will not acknowledge that. We have lodged stern representation to the US side,” he said.China firmly opposes any official exchanges between countries having diplomatic ties with China and Taiwan or signing any official documents, he said.Beijing views the Dalai Lama as a splittist who is working with foreign forces to separate Tibet from China.“Today, the House sent a strong message with the passage of resolutions calling for the end of China’s human rights abuses. The House on a bipartisan basis will always fight for freedom of religion & culture in Tibet and for the rule of law in Hong Kong,” US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted on Thursday.In his address to a key meeting on Tibet in August, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for building a “new modern socialist” Tibet, constructing an “impregnable wall” against separatism in the sensitive Himalayan region and “sinicisation” of the Tibetan Buddhism. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tibetan-political-leader-visits-white-house-for-first-time-in-6-decades-173686

The action has been taken on the basis of an SIT report,” Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi had stated.Eight policemen were ambushed at Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur as they headed there to arrest Dubey shortly after midnight on July 2.Dubey was shot dead by police on July 10 when he was allegedly trying to escape from their custody while being brought back to Kanpur after his arrest in Ujjain.A three-member SIT formed to probe the ambush of policemen pointed at a nexus between police and the slain gangster, officials said.The SIT handed over a 3,500-word report to the state government , recommending action against police personnel and administration officials.It submitted 36 recommendations, giving details of the alleged role of some officers and 80 police personnel in the Kanpur episode.It came to the fore that policemen used to alert Dubey and on the night of the ambush, he was aware that a police team was coming to Bikru, a senior officer had said.The SIT findings also referred to the alleged negligence of police in taking action against Dubey, against whom several criminal cases were pending.Sources said the SIT report also mentioned the alleged police failure in securing the conviction of Dubey and his men in cases lodged against them.The report accused personnel posted at the Kanpur’s Chaubeypur police station and senior officers of negligence, sources said.The SIT analysed Dubey’s mobile phone records going back up to a year and found that some policemen were in regular touch with him, they said.The government constituted the SIT led by Additional Chief Secretary Sanjay Bhoosreddy, with Additional DG Hari Ram Sharma and DIG Ravinder Goud as its members, on July 11.The SIT was initially asked to submit its report by July 31 after looking into all angles, studying related documents and conducting inspections in Kanpur.

She, her husband Mahadu and younger son Sudhan had converted to Christianity a couple of years back, while her elder son Subhash chose to remain a Hindu," police sub-inspector Dilip Pawar said."After the woman's death, there was a dispute between the siblings over the way her last rites should be held. An unusual situation arose as each brother insisted that the funeral should be held as per the tradition of the religions they follwed," he said.Even as a large number of villagers gathered, none of the brothers was ready to back out, Pawar said.Realising the seriousness of the situation, the 'Police Patil' (a mediator between police authorities and villagers) called up the Wada police station and informed the personnel about it."Police officer Sudhir Sankhe rushed to the village and held discussions with the family members and it was decided that the deceased woman should be buried as per the Christian tradition," he said.Accordingly, the body was buried at Pachu island near Vasai."However, the other son was not ready to relent. He held her symbolic cremation by placing a doll on the pyre," Pawar said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-sons-fight-over-last-rites-of-converted-woman-173678

21-11-2020||Agartala||One killed, 20 injured as police open fire on protesters in Tripura||One person was killed and at least 20 others were injured when police opened fire at the picketers, who blocked the Assam-Agartala National Highway at Panisagar in North Tripura district Saturday in protest against resettlement of Bru migrants from neighbouring Mizoram, police said.A large number of people had gathered on the NH 08 at Panisagar and blocked it, demanding to call off the resettlement planning of the government.The Joint Movement Committee (JMC) comprising Bengalis and local Mizos had observed five days strike from Monday on the issue and blocked NH8 Saturday.The Bru issue had started in September 1997 following demands of a separate autonomous district council by carving out areas of western Mizoram adjoining Bangladesh and Tripura.About 30,000 Bru tribals had then fled Mizoram due to the ethnic tension there and took shelter in refugee camps in Tripura.The first attempt to repatriate the Brus was made in November 2009 by the Centre along with the governments of Tripura and Mizoram.However, the effort had met with little success.The centre signed a fresh agreement in January this year according to which the Brus who stayed back in Tripura relief camps will not be forced to return.The centre sanctioned Rs 600 crore as rehabilitation package for the displaced Brus as a final solution to the vexed problem after the agreement.JMC chairman Zairemthiama Pachuau had told newsmen recently that the North Tripura district magistrate had assured that 1,500 families would be settled in the area."But now the government is trying to settle 6,000 families," he said.Trouble started, when large contingent of police and paramilitary, including Tripura State Rifles (TSR), were involved in a scuffle following altercation over withdrawal of the road blockade.Police resorted to lathi charge and later opened fire on the agitators, leading to death of a 40 year-old Srikanta Das, a carpenter who was among the protests.Additional Director General of Police Rajiv Singh said the police was compelled to fire in self defense since the crowd had turned unruly and tried to snatch weapons from the security personnel."The crowd obstructed the National Highway since morning without permission. We tried to dissuade them from doing so and after they became violent, we tried mild lathi charge, blank firing but the crowd went unruly and tried to snatch weapons. Police fired in self-defense", the official said.Singh admitted that one person was killed in the police firing and few others were wounded, but added at least nine Tripura Police and Fire Service personnel were injured in assaults by the protesters.Sources said the injured were admitted at Panisagar and adjoining hospitals and two were rushed to GBP Hospital in Agartala for treatment.However, Joint Movement Committee claimed police fired on the protesters who were agitating peacefully."Protesters were agitating peacefully. The police opened fire on them without any provocation. One died on the spot and many others were severely injured," Sushanta Baruah, convener of JMC, told reporters this evening.He also claimed Social Welfare Minister Santana Chakma, local MLA Bhagaban Das met the protesters and gave written assurance that their demands would be fulfilled soon.Mizo Convention chief and JMC leader Dr. Z Pachuau said picketers were fired upon by police without provocation, which led to retaliation from the agitators, resulting in injury to several picketers.

21-11-2020||Dehradun||India's first moss garden comes up near Nainital||India's first moss garden has been developed at Khurpatal in Nainital district, officials said on Saturday. Approved in July last year under the CAMPA scheme by the Research Advisory Committee of Uttarakhand Forest Department, the moss garden, the first in the country, was inaugurated on Friday by renowned water conservation activist Rajendra Singh, Chief Conservator of Forest Sanjiv Chaturvedi said.The main aim behind developing the garden was to conserve the various species of moss and other bryophytes and to make people aware of its significance in the environment besides creating a recreation centre for tourists, Chaturvedi who heads the research wing of the state forest department, said.Moss Garden, Khurpatal houses around 30 different species of moss and certain other bryophyte species.  Two of the moss species found here i.e. Hyophila involuta (Cement Moss) and Brachythecium Buchanani figure in International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) red list, Chaturvedi said. It has a moss trail of 1.2 km on which different moss species and scientific information about them is displayed, he said.It has an interpretation centre in which different aspects of moss are displayed through models including a First World War painting showing use of Sphagnum moss as a dressing for wounds as it absorbs liquids about three times more quickly than cotton, is cooler, softer, and less irritating than cotton, besides having antiseptic properties.  It also produces sterile environment by keeping the pH level around wounds low and thus inhibiting the growth of bacteria, the CCF said.The garden also boasts of a dinosaur model showing existence of moss since the Jurassic era, ornaments made of live moss which are very popular in Japan, moss terrarium depicting live moss ecosystem and nest of birds using moss for temperature regulation and antibacterial purposes.Poems and caricatures related to moss are also displayed at the garden.Moss are one of the most ancient flora on the planet, existing since Jurassic era.  They are the first plants to grow on rocky land and by breaking down the rocks and the soil. They help create a suitable environment for other plants to grow.Surfaces such as bare rock and thick volcanic ash are initially barren, nutrient-poor and often exposed to the sun and wind. Such surfaces are inimical to the growth of seeds of vascular plants but are readily colonized by moss species, Chaturvedi said.

21-11-2020||Toronto||Canada to return statue of Hindu goddess stolen over 100 years ago from India||A Canadian university will soon return to India a unique statue of Hindu goddess Annapoorna that was stolen from a shrine in Varanasi over a century ago and found its way to the varsity’s art gallery, in an attempt to “right historical wrongs” and help overcome the “damaging legacy of colonialism”.The statue is part of the University of Regina’s collection at the MacKenzie Art Gallery. The statue was part of the original 1936 bequest by Norman MacKenzie, the gallery’s namesake.Artist Divya Mehra brought attention to the fact that the statue had been wrongfully taken over a century ago while going through MacKenzie’s permanent collection and preparing for her exhibition, the university said in a statement on Thursday.The statue will soon begin its journey home following a virtual repatriation ceremony held on November 19. University’s Interim President and Vice-Chancellor Dr Thomas Chase virtually met with High Commissioner of India to Canada Ajay Bisaria to officially repatriate the statue, it said.This morning, the #UofRegina’s Dr Thomas Chase, Interim President & Vice-Chancellor, met with Mr. Ajay Bisaria (@Ajaybis), High Commissioner of #India (@HCI_Ottawa), over Zoom for a virtual repatriation ceremony for the Annapoorna #statue. @atTheMAG  Representatives from the MacKenzie Art Gallery, Global Affairs Canada, and Canada Border Services Agency also attended the ceremony.“We are delighted that this unique statue of Annapoorna is on her way home. I am grateful to the University of Regina for their proactive engagement for the return of this cultural icon to India,” Bisaria said.“The move to voluntarily repatriate such cultural treasures shows the maturity and depth of India-Canada relations,” he said.When Mehra researched the story behind the statue, she found that MacKenzie had noticed the statue while on a trip to India in 1913. A stranger had overheard MacKenzie’s desire to have the statue and stole it for him from its original location — a shrine at stone steps on the riverbank of the Ganges at Varanasi, India, the varsity said.Dr Siddhartha V Shah, Curator of Indian and South Asian Art at the Peabody Essex Museum, identified the statue as the Hindu goddess Annapoorna.She holds a bowl of kheer (rice pudding) in one hand and a spoon in the other. These are items associated with Annapoorna, who is the goddess of food and the queen of the city of Varanasi. She is celebrated by her devotees as one who nourishes and strengthens the body through food, and the soul through enlightenment, the statement said.“The repatriation of the Annapoorna is part of a global, long-overdue conversation in which museums seek to address harmful and continuing imperial legacies built into, sometimes, the very foundations of their collections. As stewards of cultural heritage, our responsibility to act respectfully and ethically is fundamental, as is the willingness to look critically at our own institutional histories,” said Alex King, Curator/Preparator, University of Regina President’s Art Collection.When the current administration at the university and the MacKenzie Art Gallery were alerted to the documentation which revealed the statue as an object of culture theft, both institutions committed to taking appropriate action, the varsity said.“As a university, we have a responsibility to right historical wrongs and help overcome the damaging legacy of colonialism wherever possible,” said Chase.“Repatriating this statue does not atone for the wrong that was done a century ago, but it is an appropriate and important act today. I am thankful to the MacKenzie Art Gallery, the Indian High Commission, and the Department of Canadian Heritage for their roles in making it possible,” the Vice-Chancellor said.

We cannot afford to let our guard down at this juncture,” Ambani, who is also the president of the Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University (PDPU), said at the institute’s eighth convocation.He added that India is an ancient land which has faced many adversities in the past and has emerged much stronger each time, because resilience is deep-rooted in the people and the culture.Ambani, who addressed the gathering virtually, said he sees “explosive and exponential growth” in the post-COVID era and asked the graduating students to venture out with hope and confidence without being anxious.Growth would create unprecedented opportunities and in the next two decades, India would be among the top-three economies of the world, he said.Ambani, whose company was heavily invested in the oil business and runs one of the largest refineries in the world, said the challenge facing the world currently was whether we can produce energy to sustain our economies without harming the environment.By the middle of the century, the world would use twice as much energy as we do today and India’s per-capita energy needs would be more than twice in the next two decades, he said.India needed to simultaneously pursue twin goals of becoming an economic superpower and to become a clean and green energy superpower, Ambani added.“We need disruptive solutions in renewables, low carbon and carbon recycle technologies to achieve this goal. We need breakthroughs in new energy sources such as green and blue hydrogen. We also need great innovations in energy storage, saving and utilisation,” he said.Over 2,600 students, including 284 pupils from 39 countries, graduated at the ceremony. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-enters-crucial-phase-in-fight-against-covid-19-cant-let-guard-down-at-this-juncture-ambani-173629
21-11-2020||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Cancellation of Chomsky event at Mumbai Litfest condemned||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, November 21At 91, Noam Chomsky, the celebrated American linguist and eminently respected public thinker, woke up early at his Arizona home to speak about his latest book “Internationalism or Extinction” at the Mumbai Litfest sponsored by the Tatas. But the programme was allegedly cancelled abruptly, prompting Chomsky and co-panellist Vijay Prashad to suggest that the cancellation could be an act of “censorship”.Prashad, well-known Marxist intellectual, was supposed to talk to Chomsky about the book. He alleged on Facebook that the cancellation took place “just hours before it was to go live”. The “dialogue” was “cancelled unilaterally by Anil Dharker and the team at Tata LitFest. No word from them”, Prashad wrote on Facebook.A joint statement by Chomsky and Prashad stated that in September, they were invited by the Mumbai (Tata) LitFest to participate in a “dialogue” about Chomsky’s new book.The programme was supposed to take place at 9 pm IST on November 20. At 1 pm Indian time (on November 20), the two participants received an email which said due to unforeseen circumstances, the talk had to be cancelled.“Further inquiries informed us to be in touch with the festival’s director, Anil Dharker. No communication has been established thus far with Mr. Dharker”, the statement said.It added that had they been allowed to talk, they would have not only spoken about the broad issues threatening the planet, but would have also touched upon specific role of countries such as India and corporations such as the Tatas.“We wanted to talk about how governments, such as those led by the Bharatiya Janata Party and corporations such as the Tatas, are hastening humanity towards a deeper and deeper crisis,” the statement said.Justifying participation in an event sponsored by the big corporate house, the statement says: “The Tatas do not own the platform of the Mumbai Lit Fest, which began a decade ago outside their sponsorship.”The statement also added that despite reservations about the sponsors, the signatories decided to participate in the dialogue session because the themes taken up in the book (nuclear war, climate catastrophe, erosion of democracy) needed widest circulation.Vijay Prashad’s participation in the Litfest, however, was not confined to the proposed programme on Friday evening alone. On the inaugural day of the Litfest on November 16, he took part in a panel discussion on politics and economics of US foreign intervention.The joint statement was posted by Prashad on his Facebook page as well as on his microblogging account. Chomsky’s social media accounts do not show the statement.The Litfest, the literature, art and music extravaganza that will continue till Sunday, lists prominent anti-establishment voices such as Ramchandra Guha, Javed Akhtar and Shashi Tharoor as speakers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cancellation-of-chomsky-event-at-mumbai-litfest-condemned-173625
21-11-2020||New York||Books by 3 Indian writers feature in 2020 '100 Notable Books' selected by The New York Times||Critically-acclaimed books by three Indian writers have featured among this year's 100 notable books list of The New York Times that also includes former US president Barack Obama's newly released memoir 'A Promised Land'.Editors of The New York Times Book Review selected 100 "notable fiction, poetry and nonfiction" works from around the world.The prestigious list also includes the work of fiction 'A Burning' by India-born Megha Majumdar."A brazen act of terrorism in an Indian metropolis sets the plot of this propulsive debut novel in motion, and lands an innocent young bystander in jail. With impressive assurance and insight, Majumdar unfolds a timely story about the ways power is wielded to manipulate and crush the powerless," the report said of the book.'Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line' by Deepa Anappara, who grew up in Kerala, also features on the list."This first novel by an Indian journalist probes the secrets of a big-city shantytown as a nine-year-old boy tries to solve the mystery of a classmate's disappearance. Anappara impressively inhabits the inner worlds of children lost to their families, and of others who escape by a thread," the leading daily said.Samanth Subramanian's 'A Dominant Character: The Radical Science and Restless Politics of JBS Haldane' is a nonfiction work."Haldane, the British biologist and ardent communist who helped synthesise Darwinian evolution with Mendelian genetics, was once as famous as Einstein. Subramanian's elegant biography doubles as a timely allegory of the fraught relationship between science and politics," the report said.Subramanian is a journalist and lives in London.'Red Pill' by British-Indian author Hari Kunzru also features in the list."A fellowship at a study centre in Germany turns sinister and sets a writer on a possibly paranoid quest to expose a political evil he believes is loose in the world. Kunzru's wonderfully weird novel traces a lineage from German Romanticism to National Socialism, and is rich with insights on surveillance and power," the report said.

21-11-2020||United Nations||Afghanistan can succeed only when terrorism no longer flows across Durand Line: India at UN||In an apparent reference to Pakistan, India has told the United Nations that Afghanistan can succeed only when terrorism no longer flows across the Durand Line, asserting that those providing sanctuary to terrorists must be held accountable and the Security Council should speak unequivocally against such forces.The Durand Line is the 2,640-kilometre border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.“It is our view that peace process and violence cannot go hand in hand, and we call for immediate comprehensive ceasefire. For durable peace in Afghanistan, we have to put an end to terrorist safe havens and sanctuaries operating across the Durand Line,” India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador TS Tirumurti said on Friday.Speaking at the Arria Formula Meeting on ‘What can the Security Council do to support the peace process in Afghanistan', he said the report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team under the Al-Qaeda/Daesh Sanctions Committee has also highlighted the presence of foreign fighters in Afghanistan. For violence to end in Afghanistan, these terrorist supply chains must be broken, Tirumurti said.“It is time that the Security Council speaks unequivocally against violence and terrorist forces and acts against terrorist sanctuaries and safe havens,” he said.“Afghanistan can succeed only when terrorism no longer flows across the Durand Line. Terror and violence cannot be the instrument to shape Afghanistan's future or dictate the choices Afghans make. It is important to ensure that no one provides sanctuary to terrorists who threaten Afghanistan or any other country in the region. Those who do so must be held accountable,” he said, without naming any country.Tirumurti noted that Afghanistan today is at a critical juncture and it is vital for the international community, especially the UNSC, to send the right message to everyone concerned.He stressed that the overall objective of “our endeavour has been only to bring lasting peace and stability in Afghanistan, as that is critical for the peace and security of the whole region” and in order to achieve this, the UNSC needs to ensure that the peace process must be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.The Indian envoy further stressed that it is important to ensure that the issue of full transit rights to Afghanistan is not used by states to extract political price from Afghanistan.

Sonia, who along with son Rahul Gandhi moved to Goa today for a few days to avoid Delhi pollution, approved the panels to formulate the party’s position on economic affairs, foreign affairs and national security.The most recent issue the Congress has been debating is India’s decision to stay away from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).Sharma, Tharoor, Azad and Moily had flagged their concerns in the controversial letter in August, but have since refrained from public criticism of the party leadership. The three panels have five members each, including a convener. Sharma and Tharoor have been named on the foreign affairs committee.
