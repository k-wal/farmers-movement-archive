Typically, we know that antibodies persist for about three to five months.“The CDC has said you call it a re-infection if a person gets re-infected after 90 days. We are looking at the data accordingly, as soon as we have it, we will present it to you,” ICMR Director General Balaram Bhargava said in response to a question at a press conference.Elaborating further, he said some studies have suggested that antibodies last for three months while some others said they may last in the body for up to five months also.It is a new disease and information regarding this is limited as of now, Bhargava said, adding that if antibodies decrease in the body of a person within five months of recovery, there is a possibility of re-infection with COVID-19.“That is why following COVID-appropriate behaviour like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing has to be continued even after recovery,” he said.In a press briefing last week, Bhargava had said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has decided on a 100-day cut-off for re-infection if it occurs as antibodies are also assumed to have a life of four months, according to some studies.

20-10-2020||New Delhi||Digital health ID not mandatory for accessing COVID vaccine: Health Ministry||A digital health identity under the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) will not be mandatory to get vaccinated when immunisation against COVID-19 is available, the Union Health Ministry said on Tuesday.The ambitious NDHM programme was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Independence Day speech. As per the programme, everyone enrolled for the mission will get a Health ID that will ease access to medical services."The NDHM, as it exists today, does not make a digital ID or health ID mandatory to receive service under the digital ecosystem that NDHM is creating. To say it would become mandatory for vaccination and those who do not have health ID's would be deprived is probably not the right interpretation," Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at a press conference.He said in cases where beneficiaries did not have health IDs, other IDs could be utilised."It will be almost like an electoral scenario where multiple IDs are prescribed beforehand so that no one is deprived of benefits of either voting on the day of election or vaccination on the designated day," said Bhushan.The Health Secretary's remarks came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India was working on putting a robust vaccine delivery system in place and its digitised network, along with the new digital health ID, would be used to ensure its success. The PM was speaking at the Grand Challenges Annual Meeting on Monday.Bhushan, about concerns regarding data privacy and data security under NDHM, said there was a Bill pending in Parliament which addresses this issue. "Till the Bill gets passed, NDHM has a data management policy which has been in the public domain for more than the last one month. We have received more than 7,000 comments on the data management policy of NDHM which ensures both individual data privacy as well as data security. Based on the comments that we have received, we would be suitably refining our policies," he said.The National Health Authority (NHA), the apex agency responsible for the implementation of Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY), has been given the mandate by the government to design, build, roll-out and implement the NDHM in the country.    The health ID will contain information about medical data, prescriptions and diagnostic reports and summaries of previous discharge from hospitals for ailments. The mission is expected to bring efficiency and transparency in healthcare services in the country.

20-10-2020||New Delhi||Centre considering removing plasma therapy from COVID-19 clinical management protocol||The Centre is considering removing convalescent plasma therapy from the national clinical management protocol for COVID-19, a top ICMR official said on Tuesday.Currently, the use of off-label convalescent plasma for treating COVID-19 patients in the moderate stage of the illness is allowed under “investigational therapies”.However, a randomised controlled trial led by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on 464 patients in 39 hospitals in 25 districts across 14 states and UTs has shown that plasma therapy does not reduce mortality or prevent progression of COVID-19 from moderate to severe.At a press conference, ICMR Director General Balaram Bhargava said: “We have had discussions in the national taskforce and we are in discussion with the joint monitoring group that this (convalescent plasma therapy) may be deleted from the national guidelines. The discussion is ongoing and more or less we are reaching towards that”. He was responding to a query on continued use of plasma therapy despite the ICMR-led controlled trail revealing otherwise, the result of which has been public.The ‘open-label parallel-arm phase II multicentre randomized controlled trial’ (PLACID Trial) was conducted between April 22 to July 14 to investigate the effectiveness of convalescent plasma for treatment of COVID-19.The therapy involves taking anti-bodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those into a COVID-19 patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.On the interim results of WHO Solidarity Trial indicating four repurposed drugs for COVID-19, including remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, have little or no effect on reducing mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay, Bhargava said debate and discussion were ongoing at the National Taskforce and at the Joint Monitoring Group, and advisories would be issued accordingly.“WHO solidarity trial is a 30-country trial in which India has been a participant. Interim results of this have been put on a website, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.“However, we find that these drugs are not performing as we had expected. Debate and discussion are ongoing at the National Taskforce and Joint Monitoring group and we will take into cognizance the results of this trial and issue advisories accordingly,” he said.Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon regimens were tested in 405 hospitals of 30 countries covering 11,266 adults to look into the effects of these treatments on overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay. The trial was conducted from March 22 to October 4.     “Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir and Interferon regimens appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay,” the study which appeared on medRxiv, a preprint server, on October 15 said.The trial findings are set to be published in the British Medical Journal.

The Centre misused entry 33 of the Constitution on inter-state trade to push the black laws. Today is a positively historic day when the Punjab government of Congress has restored the status quo as existed before September and also restored the security net of farmers,” said Singhvi.The four bills Punjab assembly passed today drew from the model law Singhvi drafted where he said no contract would be valid below MSP. any violation of MSP would be punishable; state laws will override other laws; farmers can go to court apart from SDMs for redressal and states will have the right to regulate the sector.Badal spoke of state amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure as significant saying “Punjab produces 38 pc food stocks of India and has 1.5 pc of the national land mass. Today farmers of Punjab have heaved a sigh of relief but the fight has just begun. Let’s see what the Centre does now. They must not forget Punjab is a border state and any kind of anxiety helps the hostile neighbours.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-laws-cong-ready-for-court-battle-says-punjab-has-given-pm-another-chance-to-correct-black-law-blunder-158606

She also visited the crime scene, they said. The CBI had registered the case on a reference from the Uttar Pradesh government and immediately dispatched a team from its Ghaziabad unit to probe the case, they said.         The team has set up a camp office in Hathras and visited the crime scene, met the family of the victim and interrogated four accused in Aligarh prison. The CBI officials had also met doctors at the Jawaharlal Nehru hospital in Aligarh where the victim treated before being shifted to Delhi, they said. The victim had succumbed to injuries during her treatment at Safdarjung hospital in Delhi on September 29. The district administration had allegedly forcibly cremated the body at the dead of the night, denying the family permission to carry it home for proper last rites.The alleged insensitive attitude of the administration had invited some sharp remarks from the Allahabad High Court. The issue snowballed into a major embarrassment for the Yogi Adityanath government as several parties including the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Rashtriya Lok Dal staged protests. The BJP government had transferred the case to the CBI after the controversy. The CBI constituted a team that has already recorded the statements of family members of the victim.The officer concerned of the Uttar Pradesh Police had registered a case of attempt to murder on a statement by the brother of the victim who, as per the FIR at Chandpa Police Station, had said that the accused tried to strangulate his sister in a field and escaped when she raised an alarm. The Casualty Medical Officer of the Aligarh Hospital in an interview had reportedly rubbished the theory of Uttar Pradesh Police that there was no rape claiming that samples sent to FSL were taken 11 days after the alleged incident.             The notification issued by the Centre on the request of the state government had asked the CBI to probe rape, murder and atrocity and “any attempt, abetment and/or conspiracy in relation to or in connection with such offence(s) and/or for any other offence committed In the course of the same transaction or arising out of the same facts”.

The case was initially registered at Sadar police station in Amritsar on April 25 this year following the arrest of one Hilal Ahmed Shergojri and recovery of Rs 29 lakh from his possession by the Punjab Police.During investigation, it was revealed that Hilal, who had come to Amritsar to collect the amount of Rs 29 lakh, was a member of proscribed terrorist organisation Hizb-ul-Mujahideen and a close associate of Riyaz Ahmed Naikoo, the then commander of the terror outfit in Kashmir Valley.“Hilal’s arrest led to busting of a major narco-terror module involved in smuggling and selling of heroin in India and channelising of drug-proceeds to Pakistan through hawala and to the HM terrorists based in Jammu and Kashmir,” the NIA said in the statement.Investigation also revealed that the conspiracy was hatched by Pakistan-based HM commanders and their associates and terrorist gangs in Punjab to support and augment the terror infrastructure of HM in India by raising money through drug smuggling, it said.During investigation, the NIA carried out searches at 15 locations belonging to the suspects and accused in Punjab, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, and so far, Rs 98.5 lakh, eight vehicles and 3 kg of heroin have been seized from them, read the statement. It added that investments worth many crores have also been identified.The NIA probe also revealed that that the accused had received at least six consignments of heroin through Attari Indo-Pakistan Border in the garb of importing rock salt granules from Pakistan and proceeds of these were partly sent back to Pakistan through hawala operators while a substantial portion was channelised to HM terrorists in J&K through a network of overground workers and other associates.In July 2019, the sixth consignment of around 532 kg of heroin was seized at Attari border and a separate case was registered, which was investigated and charge sheeted by the NIA, the probe agency said, adding that further investigation in the case has been under progress.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-files-chargesheet-in-hizb-ul-mujahideen-narco-terror-case-158599

This expenditure comes under the definition of “bribery”, which is an offence both under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Representation of the People Act, the EC said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/blackmoney-inducements-worth-over-rs-35cr-seized-in-bihar-exceed-2015-poll-figures-158594
20-10-2020||New Delhi||HC asks Army couple seeking joint posting to move to different locations within 15 days||The Delhi High Court Tuesday asked the Army’s Colonel couple who had challenged their postings to two different locations to move to their newly assigned posts within 15 days.A bench of Justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Asha Menon issued the direction while disposing of the plea by Colonel Amit Kumar who had challenged his posting to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands from Jodhpur in Rajasthan on the ground that his wife, set to be promoted as Colonel, was being sent to Bathinda in Punjab.Kumar is an officer in Judge Advocate General (JAG) department of the Army.The bench said the Army has given reasons in its order rejecting Kumar’s request/representation for a spouse coordinated posting and no ground of mala fide or violation of any rule has been made out for the court to interfere in the matter.“It is clear from the order (of the Army) that all aspects as required to be considered have been considered,” it added.The bench on September 15 had asked the Army to consider the plea as representation and take a decision on the request of the couple for a joint posting within four weeks.The high court had also put on hold the postings of the two officers till the next date of hearing on October 20.The Military Secretary Branch of the Army, subsequently, passed an order on September 30 rejecting the request citing “operational situation along the borders”, “organisational interest” and paucity of such senior officers in the JAG department.The stand of the Military Secretary Branch was opposed by the two senior officers whose counsel had claimed that the department was trying to “misguide” the court by using terms like ‘border situation’ and ‘organisational interest’ as “smokescreen”.During the hearing on Tuesday, the bench at the outset expressed displeasure over alleged leak of information to the media regarding the two officers’ grievances and said “you can either go to the media or come to the court”.The bench said the news reports while highlighting the needs of the two officers has also “painted the Army as insensitive”.“We do not appreciate said conduct of the petitioner that while matter in pending in court, he is approaching the media,” it added.Kumar said in his defence that he has not leaked any details to the media nor given any interviews.Senior advocate Rana Mukherjee, appearing for Kumar, told the bench that the Army’s September 30 order does not take into consideration the policy that children should not be separated from their parents and added that the promotion of the petitioner’s wife to the rank of Colonel has also been kept on hold.Rana also urged the bench to clarify that relief sought in the petition, filed through advocate Sunil J Mathews, with regard to formulation of a spouse coordinated posting policy has not been dealt with.The bench, thereafter, clarified that the policy formulation issue has not been dealt with in the present matter and whenever it is raised in some other plea it be decided in accordance with law.Informing the court about its decision of September 30, the Army, had said the two senior officers can only be posted together in New Delhi but it cannot be done as the JAG department presently only has 23 Colonels as against an authorised strength of 40 and static headquarters (HQs), like New Delhi, are at lower priority than field formations when postings are being considered.It had said posting the couple at New Delhi “will be at the cost of maintaining voids at formation HQs, which is not in organisational interest”.In its reply, the Army, had also said since the couple’s marriage in 2008, they have been given three spouse coordinated postings on their requests and “all-out efforts were made to post both of them in the same station”.His petition had alleged that the decision to transfer him and his wife to far-off locations has been taken as he had filed a statutory complaint against the JAG, Indian Army as well as Deputy JAG, Headquarters Southern Command, Pune.He had contended that the two senior officers allegedly influenced the said posting orders. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-asks-army-couple-seeking-joint-posting-to-move-to-different-locations-within-15-days-158593
20-10-2020||---||Violations of law cannot be condoned under pretext of human rights: MEA||New Delhi, October 20The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Tuesday said the concerns of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHRC) Michelle Bachelet about India narrowing the space for civil society organisations by tightening the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) were misplaced.“Violations of law cannot be condoned under the pretext of human rights,” said the MEA in response to the former Chilean President expressing regret over the “application of vaguely worded laws that constrain NGOs' activities and restrict foreign funding”.Bachelet in a statement noted India’s long tradition of a strong civil society was at the forefront of human rights advocacy within the country and globally. “But I am concerned that vaguely defined laws are increasingly being used to stifle these voices,’’ she added.But the MEA said, “India is a democratic polity based on the rule of law and an independent judiciary.”The FCRA, amended last month, will “create even more administrative and practical hurdles for advocacy-based NGOs”, Bachelet said while citing the case of Amnesty International closing its India offices after its bank accounts were frozen. To this charge, the MEA said, “The framing of laws is obviously a sovereign prerogative.” It pointed out that violation of law cannot be condoned because of altruistic motives. “A more informed view of the matter was expected of a UN body,” the MEA added.Bachelet complained that the Government of India had invoked FCRA over the years to justify “an array of highly intrusive measures’’, ranging from raids on NGO offices, freezing of bank accounts and cancellation of registration, including NGOs that have engaged with UN human rights bodies."I am concerned that such actions based on the grounds of vaguely defined 'public interest' leave this law open to abuse. Constructive criticism is the lifeblood of democracy. Even if the authorities find it uncomfortable, it should never be criminalised or outlawed in this way," she said."I urge the Government to ensure that no one else is detained for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly – and to do its utmost, in law and policy, to protect India's robust civil society," Bachelet added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/violations-of-law-cannot-be-condoned-under-pretext-of-human-rights-mea-158591

The judicial wing of the MHA consults the Law Ministry after which they are sent for the President's assent, they said.Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan said, “I have not seen the three farm bills passed by the Punjab Assembly. If the State’s bills are covered under Entry 14 of the State List under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, then the State is entitled to enact such a law. However, if Punjab is claiming its legislative competence under Entry 33 of Concurrent List under the Seventh Schedule, the three laws passed by the Punjab Assembly will have to be sent to the President for assent.”While Entry 14 of the State List under the Seventh Schedule deals with Agriculture, Entry 33 of Concurrent List covers trade and commerce in, and production, supply and distribution of foodstuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils, besides a host of other subjects on which both the Centre and states can enact laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-will-examine-punjab-laws-take-steps-in-best-interest-of-farmers-tomar-158590

As a token of the support and solidarity of the government and people of Tamil Nadu with the government and people of Telangana in their hour of need, I have ordered the immediate contribution of a sum of Rs 10 crore from the Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund to the government of Telangana.” It may be recalled that the state government has already sought an assistance of Rs 1,350 crore from the Union government. The Centre is yet to respond to the state’s request, while the chief minister has released Rs 550 crore from the state’s funds to deal with the issue of compensation. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted that the state may still continue to get rainfall in some parts and has issued an orange alert. Orange alert is categorised as medium where the effects of rainfall may include flooding and water logging, etc.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-postpones-all-exams-till-dussehra-due-to-unprecedented-rains-158582

The fire was eventually doused on Tuesday after almost 15 hours.“The fire broke out on the ground floor. As the Secretariat has its own fire brigade, fire tenders were pressed into service to douse it. However, the fire was intense and we had to send one dozen more fire tenders to the spot. They continued with firefighting till around 1.30 pm on Tuesday,” said a spokesperson for the Patna fire service.“The firefighters faced huge difficulties due to intensity of the fire. In the absence of access, dousing of the flames on the second floor was extremely challenging for them. No loss of human life was reported but we believe damage to properties and important documents of the Bihar government,” he added.Meanwhile, Rashtriya Janata Dal cried foul. Party spokesman Chitranjan Gagan claimed that “it is a criminal conspiracy to destroy official documents and records”.“The fire did not break out but someone intentionally lit the fire to prevent unearthing of scams in the future. The leaders of NDA allies Janata Dal-United and BJP have realised that their government will not return to power in Bihar. They are now gripped by fear that scams done during the NDA rule will be inquired into when the RJD returns to power in Bihar. Hence, they have destroyed evidence by lighting the fire in the Secretariat building,” Gagan said.He claimed that the NDA government led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was involved in over 60 scams, including the Srijan scam in Bhagalpur. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/massive-fire-destroys-records-at-patnas-secretariat-rjd-cries-foul-158576

20-10-2020||K V Prasad ||Malabar exercise and Quad: India’s key role||Tribune News Service New Delhi, October 20 With Australia deciding to rejoin the Malabar exercises to make the affair a quadrilateral engagement of the Navies of India, the United States, Japan, this year once again rekindled the debate over militarisation of the Quad. In 2007, Navies of these four countries plus Singapore was associated in a joint exercise in the Bay of Bengal leading to China raising the red flag over the purpose of such an engagement. Subsequently, Australia withdrew only to renew its request to be back in the fold some three years ago, at least as an observer.  The decision to extend invitation by New Delhi and acceptance by Canberra comes in the backdrop of the altering geo-political landscape in the region. It acquired an urgent undertone since this summer after China and India militaries are in a state of standoff in Ladakh. In was during 2017 when leaders of all four countries decided to renew Quad, first at the level of officials and then at the Ministerial level, with the latest at Tokyo earlier this month. The October 6 meeting was the first stand-alone engagement unlike the previous one held on the sidelines of a multilateral event. The broad areas of convergence arrived at are on Covid19 response and recovery, Regional Security and Maritime issues, Counterterrorism, Supply Chains, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief, Cyber Security and ASEAN-led architecture in Indo-Pacific. Now, with the Navies of all four countries working together it will be a demonstration of what the power of quadrupling can do in the Indo-Pacific region, a characterisation of the region that Beijing loathes. Previously, Chinese strategic commentators sought to dismiss Quad as an “Asian NATO” or as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at Kuala Lumpur on October 13 as “Indo-Pacific-NATO”. Wang was quoted as having said Quad pursues to “trumpet the Cold War mentality and stir up confrontation” among different groups and blocs to stir geopolitical competition and maintains dominance of the US. “In this sense, this strategy is itself a big underlying security risk. If it is forced forward, it will wind back the clock of history.”That India plays a critical role in first the revival and then pushing forward the Quad architecture in military terms can be by the sudden turn of attention to the news since Monday.  It was once said when India and China shake hands, the world watches. Now with New Delhi deciding to lend its weight with other regional powers, it is Beijing’s turn to keep a close tab. Incidentally, the Navies of India, Japan and Australia today have many platforms of US origin allowing greater interoperability and share military practices in pursuit of larger objective of a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/malabar-exercise-and-quad-indias-key-role-158573

If somebody is not doing what they want politically, across the board, they feel like they can use the CBI and the ED to pressurise them, threaten them,” Gandhi, on a three-day tour of Kerala, said.These institutions were designed to give justice to the people and not to be used as political instruments and not the “personal instrument” of the Prime Minister, he said.“It’s not only Mr Farooq Abdullah, many  people are facing this assault. I am personally facing this assault. I have a number of cases against me and there are many leaders who are facing this assault,” Gandhi said.However, when asked about the CBI and ED probe into the gold smuggling case in Kerala, the Congress leader, responded saying “justice must prevail”.“The investigation agencies are probing the matter.

20-10-2020||---||China upset over talks of Taiwan-India trade ties||New Delhi, October 20China has warned India not to develop trade ties with Taiwan following reports to this effect from a western new agency quoting unnamed government officials here.“There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. The ‘One China’ principle is the universal consensus of the international community, including India. It is also the political basis for China to develop ties with other countries. So we firmly oppose any official exchanges between countries having diplomatic ties with China,” said the Chinese Foreign Office.It also cautioned India and Taiwan against signing any official documents while asking New Delhi to remain committed to the ‘One China’ principle and approach Taiwan related issues “prudently and properly”.Taiwan has been scoring high in the recent Indian news cycle especially after Taipei detected an opening following the killings of Indian soldiers by PLA troops and the continuing tensions on the India-China border. Five days back Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen highlighted the many Indian restaurants in Taipei and how she loves to go for ‘chana masala’ and ‘naan’.India has sought to woo Taiwanese semiconductor companies while maintaining a subterranean relationship through a trade office where both countries have of late posted well regarded diplomats.Tien Chung-kwang, who headed the de facto embassy in India, “Taipei Economic and Cultural Center (TECC)”, for seven years has been replaced by Baushuan Ger. Tien has now gone on to become Taiwan’s Deputy Foreign Minister. Around the same time in July, India also replaced an acknowledged China hand Sridharan Madhusudhanan with Gauranglal Das who has had stints in Beijing, Washington and the PMO.The Modi government has approved incentives for Taiwanese firms like Foxconn Technology Group, Wistron Corp. and Pegatron Corp. for smart-phone production.Taiwan also observed its National Day in India in the most high profile manner ever with social media activists going into an overdrive after the Chinese embassy warned Indian media not to be a part of it. However, India’s bilateral trade and investments are extremely modest as compared to Taiwan’s trade ties with Japan and China.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-upset-over-talks-of-taiwan-india-trade-ties-158565
20-10-2020||Lucknow||Lucknow’s high-security zone Hazratganj fast emerging as self-immolation bid point||Lucknow’s high-security zone Hazratganj having the state assembly and various ministries located there appear to be fast emerging as a self-immolation bid point with three to four protesters daily trying to resort to this drastic measure.On Monday, a middle-aged man immolated himself in front of the state assembly, suffering 60 per cent burn injuries, while a four-member Barabanki family tried to set themselves on fire.Besides these two incidents, which came to the notice of media, at least three other self-immolation bids were foiled by police.“On Monday, two incidents of people attempting self-immolation came to notice of the media in which they had poured some inflammable liquid on themselves,” Lucknow’s Central Deputy Commissioner of Police told PTI on Tuesday.Besides these two incidents, the police had foiled three other immolation bids by protesters outside the UP Vidhan Bhavan, he said.The DCP added that on average, three to four cases of self-immolation bids occur daily outside the UP Vidhan Bhavan.These attempts, however, are foiled by alert policemen, he added.“The area around the UP Vidhan Bhavan, which also has the UP Chief Minister’s office Lok Bhavan located there, has 15 anti-immolation squads deployed there to avert any self-immolation bid,” said Barma.“Every team comprises three to four security personnel and is equipped with a fire extinguisher, blanket and first-aid treatment items,” he added.Apart from this, a total of seven police teams have been deployed in the Hazratganj with the sole mandate to patrol the area and foil self-immolation bids by protesters, the DCP said.Asked about the reasons behind the apparent spurt in self-immolation bids, the DCP said most of the cases relate to desperation out of unemployment, bad financial condition, cases of land-grabbing and harassment by people in their villages.“The police try to resolve the victims’ problems and apprise their local district officials of problems faced by these people with a recommendation to resolve their issues,” the DCP said.He said in most of the self-immolation bids, cases are not registered.“Cases are registered against those who get burn injuries or remain adamant on their stand. Apart from this, people seeking to instigate others to immolate themselves also are booked,” Barma said.A middle-aged man, Surendra Chakraborty, had immolated himself in front of the state assembly on Monday and sustained 60 per cent burn injuries.“The policemen deputed there tried to save him and rushed him to hospital. He sustained 60 per cent burn injuries,” Lucknow Police Commissioner Sujit Pandey had told PTI on Monday.“The victim had some dispute with his landlord and the matter is in court. We are trying to find out more details,” Pandey had said, adding four teams have been formed to work on the case.In another incident, four members of a Barabanki district family attempted to set themselves ablaze outside the Vidhan Bhavan building on Monday due to financial distress, but their attempts were foiled by police personnel present there. Barabanki district resident Naseer, his wife and two minor sons tried to immolate themselves near gate number 2 of the Vidhan Bhavan in the afternoon by pouring a liquid on themselves. The policemen present at the spot, however, caught hold of them before they could find a matchstick to set themselves ablaze,” Barma had told PTI on Monday.On counselling, Naseer told police that he was facing financial hardship after his shop in Barabanki was demolished in an anti-encroachment drive and this has led the family to take the extreme step, the DCP said.“As the family belongs to another district, I spoke to the district magistrate and they will be handed over to a police team from Barabanki,” Barma added.On October 13, a 35-year-old woman from Maharajganj district of Uttar Pradesh had set herself on fire near the Uttar Pradesh assembly. She succumbed to her injuries at a Lucknow hospital the following day.A Maharajganj resident, identified as Alok Prasad, has been arrested on the charge of abetment of suicide in connection with the incident.Lucknow Police Commissioner Pandey had said the woman,  identified as Anjali Tiwari, had immolated herself near the UP BJP office.She was living with a man named Asif Raja as her relationship with her husband was not good and Raja had gone abroad, Pandey had said.

20-10-2020||Wayanad (Kerala)||Nation wants to know when will Chinese troops be ‘thrown out’ of Indian territory: Rahul to PM||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday stepped up his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the military standoff with China in eastern Ladakh, telling him the nation wants to know when will the Chinese troops be “thrown out” of Indian territory."The Prime Minister will not say one word about China,” the Wayanad MP, who is on a three-day visit to his parliamentary constituency, told a news conference here.Gandhi was responding to questions, including one about Modi's announcement that he will share a message with the nation at 6 pm on Tuesday."I don't think there's any other country in the world today where a foreign power can take land from the country and then no answer from the leadership. This is shocking to me....So what I would like is the Prime Minister to tell the nation when the Chinese are going to be thrown out of Indian territory," said Gandhi.Also read: Rahul Gandhi disapproves of Kamal Nath’s ‘item’ remark against MP ministerThe Union Government had earlier termed as "mischievous interpretation" the Congress' claims that China had occupied Indian territory in the eastern Ladakh region.India and China are locked in an over five-month-long military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh."What's the date by which the Chinese soldiers are going to be kicked out of India? That's what I want to know. But I guarantee you that the Prime Minister won't have the guts to say that," he said when asked about Modi's address to the Nation later this evening.Gandhi said it's a lie that nobody had taken any land from this country, adding, “The Army believes otherwise, the Defence Ministry believes otherwise. But the PM is not able to face the reality.”         The Congress leader also accused Modi of weakening the country's basic structure, and said it was important every citizen should understand this.On the recently enacted contentious agricultural laws, the Congress leader claimed these would break the back of the farmers and asserted that his party was committed to supporting the farming community in their fight against the legislations, which had triggered protests in Punjab, Haryana and some other states."Farmers are the backbone of the economy. This is a great blow for the farmers and the impact is double as the law came into being during the COVID-19 crisis. These laws were enacted for the benefit of a few key players," he said.

20-10-2020||Lucknow/Ballia (UP)||Ballia firing: UP BJP issues show-cause notice to MLA for backing main accused||The BJP has issued a show-cause notice to its MLA Surendra Singh for making statements in support of Dhirendra Pratap Singh, a local party leader arrested for allegedly murdering a man during an event attended by senior district and police officials in Ballia.“Yes, a notice has been issued to Surendra Singh, and he has been asked to refrain from making unnecessary statements. He has been given a week to explain his stand,” Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh told PTI on Tuesday.He also said that BJP national president JP Nadda had sought information on the matter over the phone.Surendra Singh, the MLA from Bairia, had come out in support of Dhirendra Pratap Singh, who allegedly shot dead a 46-year-old man in Ballia district’s Durjanpur village following a quarrel over the public allotment of ration shops on October 15.The ruling BJP, which is already facing severe criticism over the law and order situation in the state, was left embarrassed by the Ballia shooting incident and the remarks of its legislator.The MLA had said Dhirendra Pratap Singh “opened fire in self-defence” as “it was a do-or-die situation for him”. He had also accused the administration of bias and demanded that action be taken against the other side.The MLA, who is in Lucknow, said on Tuesday that he is willing to “sacrifice anything for the respect of party workers”.When queried on the notice by the party, he said, “BJP national president JP Nadda and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh are our leaders. They can take action whenever they want.”“Any post or being an MLA does not hold any significance,” he said, adding that he has pledged to “save the honour” of the community with whose support he won the elections.BJP leader Swatantra Dev Singh said that the law should take its course in the case.Asked as to when the show-cause notice was issued to Surendra Singh, he initially said it was issued on Monday. However, later he said the notice was given on Sunday.However, BJP MP from Salempur Ravindra Kushwaha on Tuesday told reporters that the victim should be helped.To a question on allegations that MLA Surendra Singh was playing the caste card, Kushwaha said, “The BJP is the biggest political party in the world. Someone’s personal opinion does not hold any significance here.“The party is of the clear view ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’.”             Surendra Singh had told reporters on Monday that as the person who fired bullets has been arrested, those who wielded sticks and pelted stones should also face action.“Action should be taken against both sides as per their role,” he said and had also sought a CB-CID probe in the incident.He claimed that six people from Dhirendra Pratap Singh’s group were injured in the incident while one of them was hospitalised in Varanasi, but “nobody was listening to them”.So far, 10 people have been arrested in the Ballia firing case, including Dhirendra Pratap Singh.An FIR had been lodged against around 30 people, most of whom are yet to be identified.

20-10-2020||Mumbai||COVID-19: Court acquits 20 foreign attendees of Tablighi event||A Mumbai court has acquitted 20 foreign attendees of a Tablighi Jamaat event who were booked by the city police for allegedly violating prohibitory orders during the coronavirus-enforced lockdown.Metropolitan Magistrate (Andheri) RR Khan acquitted the 20 persons on Monday as the prosecution failed to prove the charges against them.“There is no iota of evidence with prosecution to show any contravention of order by accused persons beyond all shadow of doubt,” the court observed.Keeping in view the evidence on record and facts and circumstances of the matter, it is clear that the order in question was neither publicly promulgated nor brought into notice of the accused persons, the court said.The prosecution witnesses clarified that the accused have not violated the lockdown norms and order of the police commissioner, it noted.The court also said versions of the witnesses were contrary to the documentary evidence on record.“The prosecution has not even carried out preparation of panchanama and never recorded statement of any other independent witness. Thus, there is no legal evidence furnished by prosecution in support of the charge,” it said.The court further noted that the witnesses were also not found in a position to tell where and how the accused people were residing at the time of the alleged offence.A case was registered against two groups, each comprising 10 foreign nationals, in April by DN Nagar police in Andheri under Indian Penal Code Sections 188 (disobedience of order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 and 270 (acts likely to spread infection of dangerous disease).They were also charged under provisions of the Foreigners Act, the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act.A sessions court has already discharged them for offence under IPC Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 304(2) (homicide not amounting to murder).

20-10-2020||Mumbai||Advertising regulator comes out with advisory for ads on COVID-19 messaging||The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) on Tuesday came out with an "advisory" on COVID-19-related messaging on the dos and don’ts to be followed by brands as part of steps to check misleading claims.The self-regulatory body for the advertising industry said there has been a proliferation of advertisements with misleading message claims during the pandemic. “We want products and advertisements to stick to claims and promises that are well backed by adequate substantiation. The advisory to advertisers is meant to safeguard consumers as well as to ensure the highest standards for advertising,” ASCI's secretary general Manisha Kapoor said. She said the four-point advisory has been after consultations with advertisers, as well as with technical experts in different fields such as biochemistry, ayurveda, food and nutrition, she said, adding the pandemic cannot be a platform to mislead consumers. The advisory asks advertisers of Ayurvedic, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy products and services to abide by AYUSH Ministry order of April 1 on Coronavirus advertising, according to a statement. It also asks advertisers to avoid claiming destruction or removal of any virus other than coronavirus and if they indeed wish to do so, to include a disclaimer saying the same is not applicable to COVID-19. “Advertisers are advised to be particularly careful whilst making, directly or indirectly, claims to reduce the chances of becoming infected with coronavirus (COVID-19) or gain immunity against it,” the advisory states. Products which are not internally consumed or applied to bodies, that is, not requiring license under the Drug and Cosmetic Act, should be “particularly cautious” while making claims regarding prevention of, immunity against or treatment for coronavirus (COVID-19), it added. Following the April 1 order, where the AYUSH ministry had sought help from the ASCI, the body said it has processed 250 advertisements and reported 233 from the healthcare sector to the ministry. Of these, 162 were successfully resolved as the advertisers either withdrew the advertisements or modified them. The remaining 71 were taken up by the ministry for appropriate action, it said.

20-10-2020||Wayanad||Rahul Gandhi disapproves of Kamal Nath’s ‘item’ remark against MP minister||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday disapproved of Madhya Pradesh Congress chief Kamal Nath’s ‘item’ remark against Minister Imarti Devi, saying it was ‘unfortunate’.“One cannot treat women with disrespect. Kamalnath ji is from my party. But I don’t like personally that type of language that Kamalnath ji has used. I do not appreciate it. It is unfortunate,” Gandhi, on a three-day visit to Kerala, told reporters here.Addressing a campaign meeting on Sunday for the November 3 byelection in Gwalior’s Dabra town, where the BJP has fielded Imarti Devi, Kamal Nath has said the Congress candidate was a “simple person” unlike his opponent who was an “item”.The remarks have triggered an outrage with BJP leaders, led by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, staging protests against Kamal Nath.The National Commission for Women has sought an explanation from the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister for his remark.Chouhan has also written to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, asking her to condemn Nath’s remarks and remove him from all party posts.Kamal Nath has expressed regret over his remark and asserted that he did not say anything disrespectful. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-disapproves-of-kamal-naths-item-remark-against-mp-minister-158553
20-10-2020||Mumbai||Tanishq ad created a ‘movement’; many buying products to make point: Ad maker||More number of people have seen the now-withdrawn Tanishq advertisement as the controversy also created a “movement” where many were buying Tanishq products to take a stand, the advertisement campaign’s creator said on Tuesday.“The ad showed realities and after the controversy, a silent majority of people has started speaking out against a vocal minority,” according to Amit Akali, managing partner and creative head of ‘Whats Your Problem’, the agency behind the advertisement campaign.In an interview to PTI, he also asserted that no one would have expected the backlash because “communal harmony is the centre of our fabric”.Nevertheless, on withdrawing the advertisement, he termed Tanishq as a “brave” company that considered the safety of employees in the face of the controversy.The $120-billion Tata Group chose to withdraw the 55-second Tanishq advertisement, which shows a Muslim mother-in-law caring for her pregnant Hindu daughter-in-law, in the wake of a furore online and displeasure among certain groups for alleged communal tones.“People are going out there and telling us that we will not let this film get deleted. They are sharing the film on their own even though it has been removed. Or there is a movement where people are buying Tanishq and showing us the bills,” Akali told PTI.Despite the advertisement being withdrawn, many people came in support of the campaign and made their displeasure against the online trolls known.“We are at that stage where the majority is speaking up and that is where the love for Tanishq started coming in. I think this is a normal phenomenon in any country,” he said, pointing out that this was contrary to the behavioural phenomenon called “spiral of silence”.Spiral of silence referred to a large part of the majority staying silent because this was a way of life for them but there was a vocal minority which keeps speaking, he said.Making it clear that the intent behind the campaign was just to show cultural realities which gel well with a brand’s promise and not political at all, Akali said the broader ‘Ekatvam’ or unity campaign of Tanishq would continue.Stating that the society sided with Tanishq because the message resonated with it, he said “more people have seen the message than if it wasn’t removed”. It was a simple film showing how a pregnant daughter-in-law was cared for in our society where multiple communities thrive, he added.He said the advertisement which ran into the controversy was part of a broader campaign called ‘Ekatvam’, wherein the jewellery brand has tied up with 1,000 craftsmen across 15 cultures of India to launch a collection.On the Tata Group company withdrawing the advertisement, Akali backed Tanishq terming the client as a “brave” company which took the stance of employee safety in the face of the controversy.“I would have taken exactly the same decision if I would have been in the client’s shoes. Nothing is more important than the safety of an employee. It is a brave client and the client took a stance for the safety of its employees,” he said.However, he declined to elaborate on the difficulties encountered since the controversy erupted.The past week since the controversy seems longer than seven days but the love received from across the world was “beautiful, fantastic and overwhelming”, Akali said.He said an online group had been created where over 200 people have come up with their own stories of interfaith marriage and attempts are being made to document these experiences as a book as well.“We were very clear that we wanted to take a stance versus just communicate about a product or just talk about the festive season. The stance we took was Ekatvam or unity,” he said and stressed that there was nothing audacious in taking the stance despite the events such as the anti-CAA protests and general communal attitude in the country.“We didn’t set out to do audacious things, we set out to do correct things, things happening around us and this is normal reality. A mother-in-law taking care of the daughter-in-law is the reality,” Akali said and asserted that he is himself a Hindu-Sikh married to a Parsi.When asked whether the advertisement could be termed as an inflection point where the silent majority had started speaking out, Akali said he did not want any such credit and added that the society was always outspoken.He, however, exuded confidence that history would look at the campaign as a “watershed moment” from a marketing perspective where a brand spoke what it wanted to.

20-10-2020||Patna||As Tejashwi, Chirag defend their fathers’ legacies, others from pol families take poll plunge||The Bihar assembly election 2020 is testing the mettle of the scions of two foremost political dynasties in the state — the Prasads and the Paswans — as they fight a gruelling electoral battle to protect and preserve the formidable legacies of their fathers.Tejashwi Yadav, the articulate younger son of RJD supremo Lalu Prasad who helms the five-party Grand Alliance, has been the state’s deputy chief minister for a couple of years but faces the electorate for the first time without his charismatic father by his side.Chirag Paswan, to whom his father Ram Vilas Paswan had passed on the baton of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) in his lifetime, is ploughing a lonely furrow in the absence of the wise counsel of his father, the redoubtable Dalit leader from Bihar with a national appeal, who died a few days ago.Chirag, the sitting Lok Sabha MP from Jamui, faces the daunting task of carrying forward the legacy of his father, who had friends across the political divide, virtually friendless.Paswan Junior walked out of the NDA in Bihar when his father was on the death bed and has been furiously attacking Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who is also the JD(U) boss and the ruling coalition’s chief ministerial contender.However, he, all the while, has been professing his loyalty to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and calling himself his ‘Hanuman’.Amid hushed whispers about the “tacit” backing Chirag has of a section of the BJP leadership, Kumar, a loyal adherent to realpolitik, made some senior leaders of the saffron party, including Union Minister Prakash Javadekar, openly renounce and denounce Paswan Jr, who they called a ‘vote katua’ (vote splitter who doesn’t stand to gain much) that was trying to confuse the NDA voters.With the support of his numerically small but assertive Paswan castemen, the LJP president hopes to clinch sufficient number of seats in the 243-member Bihar assembly to stay relevant in state politics.The party had won six Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 elections, largely because of the alliance it had with the BJP and the JD(U). It had won just two seats in the 2015 assembly polls.According to analysts, Tejashwi is comparatively on a more firm footing, particularly because of the pre-ponderance of the Yadavs, the single biggest caste in the state. In several constituencies, Yadav candidates have won and finished second election after election.Though Lalu Prasad may not be around to lead his army in the electoral battlefield, many in the opposition claim he had a decisive say in selecting candidates and finalising the seat-sharing formula while still serving time in a Ranchi jail after his conviction in the fodder scam.The RJD-led alliance has the Congress, the CPI, the CPI(M) and the CPI-ML as its constituents.The Muslims have, by and large, stood behind the RJD- Congress combine and according to close watchers of the poll scene, things will be no different this time.Tejashwi’s elder brother Tej Pratap, a sitting MLA from Mahua, has shifted to Hasanpur in Samastipur district.Chirag Paswan has nominated his cousin Krishna Raj from Rosera constituency.Apart from Tejashwi and Chirag, who have big shoes to fill, a bevy of young men and women belonging to lesser political clans are set to try their luck at the hustings.RJD vice president Shivanand Tiwari’s son, Rahul Tiwari, is seeking re-election from Shahpur seat in Buxar while its state unit head Jagdanand Singh’s son Sudhakar Singh has got ticket from Ramgarh.Former union minister Kanti Singh’s son, Rishi Singh, will try to find a way to political success with lantern, RJD’s election symbol, in hand in Obra. Randhir Kumar Singh, the son of former Lok Sabha MP Prabhunath Singh, is trying his luck on RJD ticket from Chapra.Jai Prakash Narain Yadav, a former union minister considered close to the RJD supremo, has managed to secure a ticket for his daughter Divya Prakash from Tarapur and brother Vijay Prakash from Jamui.In Jamui, Vijay Prakash will cross swords with Sherayasi Singh, commonwealth shooting gold medalist and daughter of former union minister late Digvijay Singh.Sherayasi is the BJP nominee for the seat.Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has kept away his family, including son Nishant, from politics, but has rewarded the children of his loyalists with JD(U) tickets.Former MP Jagdish Sharma’s son Rahul Kumar is in the fray from Jehanabad while Nikhil Mandal, the son of sitting MLA from Madhepura Mahindra Kumar Mandal, has replaced his father. Meena Kamat, daughter-in-law of late state minister Kapildeo Kamat, is the JD(U) candidate for Babubarhi seat in Madhubani.The ruling party has also fielded Kaushal Kishore, a son of Haryana Governor Satya Narayan Arya, from Rajgir (reserved) seat. Arya represented Rajgir seven times as a BJP nominee.From the BJP, Union Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey failed to secure a ticket for his son Arijit Shashwat but Nitin Nabin, the son of seasoned BJP leader the late Naveen Kishore Prasad Sinha, is in the fray from Bankipur.Nabin, however, has come into his own and represented the seat thrice.The Congress, which got 70 seats as part of the seat-sharing pact with the RJD, has also accommodated a host of children of its leaders.Actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha’s son Luv Sinha is in the fray from Bankipur while its legislature party leader Sadanand Singh’s son Subhanand Mukesh has taken over from his father in Kahalgaon.Neither Sinha nor Singh find anything unusual about children of political leaders walking into their footsteps.“My son is not a parachute candidate. He is fighting election as ‘Bihari putra’. He has worked in the constituency since 2009 when I first contested Lok Sabha election from my native Patna Sahib constituency, said Sinha.Sadanand Singh, eight-term MLA from Kahalgaon since 1980, is 77 now, and wants his son to take over the mantle from him.“How long can I continue? Nowadays politics means moving regularly from one village to another and touring the constituency throughout the five-year term. It’s difficult for me to take so much physical rigour at this age,” he said.Shivanand Tiwari, a comrade-in-arms of leaders like Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar during the days of the JP movement, said young people should be encouraged to join politics.“Youth should be welcomed to join politics. It’s not for my family but people to elect my son,” Tiwari, a former MP and Bihar minister said.Another notable leader whose ward has taken the political plunge is Subhashini Yadav, the daughter of socialist veteran Sharad Yadav, from Bihariganj in Madhepura. Yadav, who has been keeping indifferent health, represented Madhepura in the Lok Sabha several times.“I have taken the political plunge to save the legacy of my father,” she said.

They should not be discriminated against and abused in the process of incarceration during the pandemic, the Commission further said.The Commission also asked to ensure uninterrupted availability of antiretroviral treatment (ART), HIV testing, hormonal treatment (HRT) and gender-affirming treatment, including mental health treatment for the LGBTQI community through all districts and local hospitals and medical health centres even during the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nhrc-issues-covid-related-advisory-to-govt-for-lgbtqi-community-158535
20-10-2020||Mumbai||Pandemic to shave off 40 pc operating profit of private hospitals: Report||The pandemic will eat up around 40 per cent of the operational profit of private hospitals this fiscal as billing has plunged drastically due to the virus outbreak and the resultant proclivity of people to avoid hospitals for non-emergency situations, says a report.The Crisil report released on Tuesday, however, noted that a large number of pandemic cases, which though is low-margin, will get these hospitals an additional revenue to the tune of 15 to 20 per cent.Further, with the relaxation in lockdown and travel restrictions, footfalls have started improving from July, helping bed-occupancy levels.The report also expects bed-occupancy levels to stabilise 65 to 70 per cent of the pre-lockdown levels in the second half of the fiscal. This, along with additional revenue from the pandemic treatment would help limit overall decline in revenue to 16 to 18 per cent, as against 17 per cent annual growth logged in the two preceding fiscals, it said.Since the pandemic-driven lockdowns that began late March, hospitals have been on a crisis path as people began to avoid going to hospitals for regular consultations and began to postpone elective surgeries, which have been the most lucrative procedures for any hospital, especially organ transplants among others.“A triple whammy of postponement in elective surgeries, revenue loss from the highly profitable medical tourism segment and increasing costs will lead to 35 to 40 per cent reduction in operating profit of private hospitals this fiscal,” Crisil said.The report is based on the analysis of 40 hospitals, including 36 rated by the agency, which accounts for over Rs 36,000 crore of the sector’s revenue.Even though the trauma and emergency treatment account for 28 to 30 per cent of revenue continued but at a much lower level, given the fewer accidents during the lockdowns.On top of these, medical tourism, which accounts for 10 to 12 per cent of revenue but gets the highest margins, especially for large hospitals, came to a complete standstill, due to travel restrictions imposed as part of the lockdowns.However, the pandemic is set to bring them around 20 per cent of the revenue despite low margin.“Treating COVID-19 patients is expected to provide an additional revenue stream and may contribute 15 to 20 per cent to revenue this fiscal. But it is not as profitable as other revenue streams. Additionally, given the high fixed cost structure of hospitals, lower overall occupancy will result in lesser absorption of overheads. This, coupled with the increased cost of safety and sanitation will lead to 35-40 per cent decline in operating profit this fiscal,” the report said.Weakened operating performance accentuated cash-flow challenges in the first half and to manage the situation, hospitals have deferred 35 to 40 per cent of planned capex for this fiscal, and are now resorting to short-term debt funding.About a third of the agency-rated hospitals also availed moratorium for loan repayments which supported their liquidity during the first half.Nonetheless, the credit outlook for the sector remains moderately negative, with credit metrics being impacted primarily by lower profit, the report said adding that the deterioration in performance was expected to be only temporary and a strong bounce-back was likely in the next fiscal supported by pent up demand.“Elective surgeries cannot be postponed indefinitely and medical tourism is also expected to recoup as travel restrictions ease. We expect a healthy 25 per cent revenue growth in fiscal 2022, and operating profitability to recover to pre-pandemic levels, including due to lower share of less-profitable treatment for the pandemic patients,” the report said.

With Dussehra around, he also quoted a verse from Ramcharitra Manas to convey the message that people should not take any disease lightly until it is cured.The country today has 90 lakh beds for Covid patients, 12,000 quarantine centres, 2,000 testing labs and soon will cross conducting 10 crore testsPM Modi said since the start of ‘Janata Curfew’ on March 22 till date, the country has travelled a long distance in this fight against Covid-19 and today due to the measures it has one of the lowest rates both in terms of cases or fatality.As against per 10 lakh, India has 5,500 cases while US and Brazil records above 25,000 and the death rate is 83 as against 600 plus in countries like the US, Brazil, Spain and many resource rich countries.The country today has 90 lakh beds for Covid patients, 12,000 quarantine centres, 2,000 testing labs and soon will cross conducting 10 crore tests.The world today is one in the fight to save humans from the virus and vaccines are in various stages of development. Indian scientists too are working. The Government, he emphasised, is already on the move to work on a plan so that it reaches every citizen.PM Modi urged all citizens especially those in the media and active on social media to join efforts in this campaign to make people aware of the need to adhere to precautions like wearing a mask, maintain social distance and frequent hand washing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-room-for-laxity-in-fight-against-covid-19-adhere-to-precautions-pm-modi-158528
20-10-2020||New Delhi||Daily COVID-19 cases fall below 50,000 after 84 days||India’s COVID-19 graph dipped dramatically on Tuesday with daily new cases dropping below 50,000 for the first time in 84 days. The country saw 46,790 cases today. The last time this level of daily surge was recorded was on July 29 when 48,513 cases were registered in 24 hours.In another milestone achievement today, India has recorded the lowest cases per million people in the last seven days globally as per the data maintained by the WHO to monitor recent worldwide trends in the pandemic.As against the global average of 315 cases per million in the last week, India saw 310 cases as against France’s 2,457, Spain’s 936 and US’ 1,153. Most of these nations are witnessing second surges of the pandemic after the same had peaked.India’s total recoveries surged past 67 lakh, the highest recoveries in the world and the total number of tests reached 9.6 crore, the second highest level of tests globally.Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said India’s cumulative COVID positivity rate had declined to 7.90 per cent despite high levels of testing and reacting to the government modelling that has projected pandemic control by early 2021, Bhushan said, “The experts have said the downward trend will continue only if people wear masks, maintain physical distance and hand and face hygiene. They have said that the pandemic is getting less active but the numbers can rise again if people do not maintain COVID appropriate behaviour. So going forward we have to all continue to do more of the same and even more efficiently.”India’s active cases as of today are 7,48,538 which is only 9.8 per cent of the total confirmed cases.“Nearly 64 per cent of active cases are in six states. Among them 50 per cent active cases are in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala and the rest in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal,” said Health Secretary assuring the country of adequate medical oxygen stocks in India to deal with COVID cases.There are 57,357 patients on oxygen as of today as against 75,098 on September 24.“Medical oxygen was never in short supply in India over the period of the pandemic outbreak. Even now we have surplus stocks and are augmenting oxygen generation capacities constantly,” said Bhushan.In an important clarification, the Health Secretary said digital health IDs would be one of the means to administer COVID vaccines to people, and multiple IDs would be allowed for immunisation as is done for voting.Responding to PM Narendra Modi’s comments yesterday that digital health IDs would be used to immunise people against COVID-19, Bhushan said, “It would be wrong to interpret that those who do not have digital IDs will be denied the benefit of immunisation. Digital health IDs will be used. It would be like an electoral scenario where multiple IDs are prescribed so that no one is denied the benefit of voting. We are also amending the data management policy under the National Digital Health Mission which has been in public domain for several months and on which we have received 7,000 comments.”Bhushan said if current vaccine trials succeed, India would have enough vaccine doses between January and July to immunise priority population which has been identified by the national vaccine administration task force. Bhushan did not elaborate on who these beneficiaries would be.Plasma therapy to be discontinued in clinical protocols ICMR DG Balram Bhargava today said the government was working on the deletion of convalescent plasma therapy from the national COVID management protocol. Several studies have shown plasma has no benefit in COVID patients, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/daily-covid-19-cases-fall-below-50-000-after-84-days-158521

20-10-2020||---||Arnab Goswami, Republic TV to sue Mumbai Police chief for Rs 200 crore for ‘damage to reputation’ in TRP case||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh, October 20Republic TV on Monday said, that it will sue Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh for Rs 200 crore for allegedly damaging its reputation by linking it to the Television Rating Points scam.The channel added, that it will file a contempt petition against Special Executive Magistrate and the Assistance Police Commissioner Sudhir Jambwadekar “on account of the fact that he initiated chapter proceedings with respect to the FIRs [first information reports] that have been suspended by the Bombay High Court,” it said in a statement. The statement read:Meanwhile, Republic TV’s announcement came hours after the Bombay High Court said if the Mumbai police crime branch proposes to arraign Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami in the television rating points (TRP) case, it should first issue summons to him as was done for eight others in the case.A division bench of justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik said if such a summons is issued then Goswami shall appear before the police and cooperate with the investigation.The court also directed police to submit for its perusal investigation papers pertaining to the case in a sealed cover by November 5 when it would hear the matter."The FIR is not an encyclopedia. We would like to peruse the investigation papers and see what probe has been done from today till the next date of hearing," the court said.The court was hearing a petition filed by ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, which owns Republic TV, and Goswami seeking to quash the FIR lodged on October 6.The petition has also sought a direction to transfer the case to CBI to ensure a fair and transparent probe and also on the ground that the case will have pan-India repercussions.The plea said the HC should stay the investigation and restrain police from taking any coercive action against the petitioners pending hearing of their petition.Appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel Harish Salve sought the court to grant Goswami protection from arrest."The police have been targeting him (Goswami) and there is apprehension that he may be arrested," Salve said.Senior counsel Kapil Sibal, appearing for Maharashtra government and police, said since Goswami has not been named as accused in the case as of now, there cannot be any order granting him protection.Sibal told the court that till now police have issued summons to eight persons in connection with the TRP case and questioned them."None of these persons has been arrested," he said.In a media release, Republic TV claimed Maharashtra government and Mumbai police have admitted in court that the channel is not named in the FIR in the TRP case.The court noted that since Goswami has not been named as an accused in the case, it cannot pass an order granting him protection or directing the police to not take any coercive action against him."In case the Investigating Officer proposes to name petitioner No 2 (Goswami) as accused in the case, then, as done with the eight persons, summons shall be issued to him (Goswami). The petitioner No 2 shall then cooperate with the police," the court said.The court also raised questions on whether it was correct on the part of the Mumbai police and its commissioner Param Bir Singh to hold press conferences in such matters."We don't know if it is the correct method or procedure to give interviews to the media. We are not talking about just this matter but many sensitive cases...we find police giving information to the media even when investigation is in progress. Police are not supposed to reveal incriminating information pertaining to the case," Justice Shinde said.Sibal, while agreeing to this, assured the court that the police shall not speak to the media with regard to the TRP scam case."But at the same time, even the petitioner channel should assure the court it will not indulge in vilification of the police and conduct a media trial," he said.To this, Justice Shinde said, "Media is considered as the fourth pillar of democracy and, hence, they too need to behave responsibly."Salve, while seeking for the FIR to be quashed, argued that no offence is made out and the entire conduct of the police reeks of malafide and was only an attempt to silence the voice of the petitioners."The petitioner has been targeted by the police and the Maharashtra government since his strong reports during the Palghar lynching incident. A slew of FIRs has been registered against him after his reports then. This whole thing is a disguise and excuse to target Goswami and Republic TV," Salve said.Sibal, however, said the Palghar lynching incident and the petitioners' reports on the same have nothing to do with the present case."The present investigation pertains to money paid to rig TRPs in order to gain commercial profit. The investigation is at a nascent stage. Maybe many other media channels are also involved," Sibal told the court.The TV channel filed the plea in HC on October 16, a day after the Supreme Court refused to hear a plea filed by one of its senior officials challenging the summons issued to them by the Mumbai police."The officers and key managerial persons of the channel and Arnab Goswami have reasonable and tangible grounds to believe they will be apprehended by the Mumbai police in connection with the FIR which is false, frivolous, politically motivated and an attempt to muzzle the media and silence the news reporting by Republic TV," the petition said.The Mumbai Crime Branch registered the FIR under various sections of Indian Penal Code for cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy against Republic TV and its senior officials and also against two other local regional channels.The plea also said the court should initiate a CBI inquiry and disciplinary proceedings under the service rules against Param Bir Singh for "gross dereliction of duty and abuse of power"."Republic Media Network Editor-in-Chief and Managing Director Arnab Goswami has directed his legal team Phoenix Legal to initiate the proceedings to sue Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh for Rs. 200 crore damages-- Rs.100 crore for damage to the reputation of Arnab Goswami, and Rs. 100 crore for the damage caused to Republic Media Network," Republic TV said in the statement."At present, the legal teams of Republic are in the process of filing the defamation suit against Param Bir Singh," the channel said."Contradicting their own Police Commissioner, the Mumbai Police and Maharashtra Government lawyer today in the Bombay High Court admitted that Republic is not named in the FIR in the TRP case, and seemed to distance itself from the allegations made by the Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh," the statement said."Following this admission by the Maharashtra Government in open court, Arnab Goswami has directed that he will take every legal action against Param Bir Singh (and others if so required) and seek damages via a defamation suit," the channel said.Republic TV said it will file a contempt petition against Special Executive Magistrate and Assistant Police Commissioner Sudhir Jambwadekar, "on account of the fact that he initiated chapter proceedings with respect to FIRs that have been suspended by the orders of the Bombay High Court." — With PTI News Release: Arnab & Republic to sue Param Bir Singh for Rs. 200 cr, as Maharashtra Govt and Mumbai Police admit in court that Network is not named in the TRP case FIR. pic.twitter.com/iNSoasmyaa||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arnab-goswami-republic-tv-to-sue-mumbai-police-chief-for-rs-200-crore-for-damage-to-reputation-in-trp-case-158514

20-10-2020||New Delhi||Polls amid COVID-19: Govt enhances expenditure limit of candidates||The poll spending limit for candidates contesting Lok Sabha and assembly elections has been enhanced by 10 per cent based on the recommendation of the Election Commission that contestants be allowed to spend more on campaigning keeping in mind difficulties they may face due to COVID-19 curbs.The hike in expenditure limit will help candidates contesting Bihar assembly poll as well as bypolls to one Lok Sabha and 59 assembly seats.Over a month ago, the Election Commission had recommended a 10 per cent hike in expenditure for all elections to be held during the COVID-19 pandemic.The hike was recommended keeping in mind the difficulties candidates may face in campaigning amid the restrictions imposed, including those on holding rallies amid the pandemic.The notification issued by the Law Ministry on Monday night said the maximum expenditure a candidate can incur for campaigning in Lok Sabha polls is now Rs 77 lakh. It was so far Rs 70 lakh.For assemblies, it has been hiked from Rs 28 lakh to Rs 30.8 lakh.The maximum expenditure limit for candidates to spend for their campaigning varies from state to state.The notification, which amended the Conduct of Elections Rules, does not mention that the limit has been hiked keeping in mind the pandemic and whether it is limited for polls being held amid COVID-19.The amended rules, the notification said: “Shall come into force on the date of their publication in the official Gazette and shall remain in force till such date as may be notified by the Central Government.”“The maximum expenditure limit was enhanced for a reason. But the notification need not mention the reason,” explained a senior EC functionary.The last time the expenditure ceiling was enhanced was in 2014 just ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.Assembly polls in Bihar will be held on October 28, November 3 and November 7.Most of the assembly bypolls will be held on November 3.Bypolls to the Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha seat in Bihar and some assembly seats in Manipur will take place on November 7.

20-10-2020||Mumbai||Patients play ‘garba’ at COVID-19 facilities, videos go viral||Two videos of patients performing ‘garba’ at COVID-19 facilities in Mumbai have surfaced on social media, even as the Maharashtra government has appealed to people to hold health and blood donation camps instead of dandiya during the ongoing Navratri festival.In one of the videos, a number of COVID-19 patients with masks on their faces are seen performing garba along with health workers wearing PPE kits on a Bollywood song in a female ward.In the clip, some female patients are also seen watching the performance.In another video, some male patients are seen doing garba with healthcare professionals who are in PPE kits at ‘Nursing Station 15’.According to some social media posts, the videos of garba performance are from the Goregaon-based jumbo COVID-19 facility of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).When contacted, BMC Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal told PTI on Tuesday that one of the videos of the garba performance was from the BMC’s COVID-19 centre but the facility’s dean told him they had not organised it.Chahal said the facility’s dean also informed him that the patients were celebrating on their own in the ward along with health workers and they were feeling happy and good.“As it was a sign of happiness, the doctors inside (the facility) allowed them to celebrate,” he said quoting the dean. The facility’s dean also said there was no harm if the patients do something to be happy in a COVID-19 centre, the civic chief added.Mumbai is one of the worst affected by COVID-19 in the county with nearly 2.43 lakh cases and over 9,700 deaths reported from the metropolis so far.The Maharashtra government last month urged people to celebrate the Navratri and forthcoming Dussehra festival in a low-key manner due to the coronavirus outbreak.In the guidelines issued on September 29, it suggested organising health and blood donation camps instead of dandiya, garba and cultural events involving mass participation.Even the BMC earlier this month appealed to people to strictly follow guidelines issued by the state government while celebrating the Navratri and Dussehra festivals.

He has not given information about his first wife, but about his mistress,” he was heard as saying.Kunjam termed Bisahulal Singh’s statement as baseless and said he would file a defamation suit against him.“I got married 15 years back and have a 14-year-old daughter. I will file a defamation suit against him. This exposes the BJP candidate’s character. On one hand, they are staging a drama of silent fast and on the other hand, they disrespect women,” he said.The BJP minister could not be contacted for a reaction.State BJP spokesman Rajnish Agrawal said he was unable to contact Singh as he was campaigning in interior areas.BJP leaders in Madhya Pradesh, led by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, on Monday sat on a two-hour silent fast to protest against Kamal Nath’s remark wherein he referred to state minister Imarti Devi as “item” during an election rally.Bypolls for 28 Assembly seats in the state will be held on November 3.

The first lot of 15,000 arrived in Delhi two weeks ago. With additional troops along the LAC in Ladakh, the emergency purchase was needed. The night temperature dropped below freezing a couple of weeks ago at altitudes over 14,000 feet near the LAC.Soldiers will also be provided arctic tents and special high-nutrient diet. The Army already has a heated habitat facility with bunker-type beds.It is the first time that so many troops will be stationed during winter in eastern Ladakh. Under normal circumstances, there are no more than two brigades (around 10,000 troops). This year, 30,000 additional troops have been stationed since May to ward off any misadventure by China.Clothing and boots are provided in multiple pairs as they tend to get wet in the snow. Just the clothing and gear to tackle the cold — night temperatures are expected to hover around minus 30°C in peak winter — will cost over Rs 1 lakh for each soldier, sources said.Normally, patrolling is curtailed in winter. But this time, it is expected to be different as the People’s Liberation Army is stationed just across the LAC. The winter set in in the first week of September.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-made-jackets-for-soldiers-in-ladakh-158420

20-10-2020||Patna||BJP calling LJP ‘vote katua’ to appease Nitish: Chirag||Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Chirag Paswan on Monday voiced strong displeasure over the use of term “vote katua” for his party by some BJP leaders to keep Bihar CM Nitish Kumar happy, and asserted his party would win more seats in the Bihar Assembly polls than the JD(U).“Vote katua” is an expression used in the Hindi heartland for political parties and candidates in elections who are in the fray to eat into the votes of others without benefiting themselves.‘Hurt by accusation’I urge more respect from the BJP leaders towards my late father who was their colleague in the government just until 11 days ago. I am pained at the usage of term vote katua. — Chirag Paswan, LJP chief“I am pained at the term vote katua being used against the LJP. They should apply their own wisdom and not use such words just to make somebody happy. I don’t mind whatever BJP leaders say because I know they are just putting words to the Chief Minister’s thoughts,” said the 37-year-old son of the late Ram Vilas Paswan.Several top BJP leaders, including Union Minister Prakash Javadekar and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, have called the LJP a “vote katua” in the Bihar election fray.They have also accused him of creating confusion in the minds of the electorate by claiming close proximity to senior BJP leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Chirag, who has the responsibility of carrying his father’s impressive political legacy forward, has repeatedly professed his unflinching loyalty to Modi, saying he was like “Hanuman” to the Prime Minister.Urging more respect from the BJP towards his late father and former Union minister, he said he should not use such terms for a party built painstakingly by somebody who was their colleague in the government just until 11 days ago.“Ultimately, a BJP-LJP government will be formed in the state after November 10,” he said.The LJP which has dissociated itself from the NDA in Bihar, has put up candidates against JD(U) nominees in many places.1,510 in fray for 2nd phaseA total 1,510 candidates are left in the fray for the second phase of polling to 94 Assembly seats in Bihar after the scrutiny of nomination papers, state Chief Electoral Officer said on Monday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-calling-ljp-vote-katua-to-appease-nitish-chirag-158399

The Election Commission on Monday sought a “detailed report” from the chief electoral officer of Madhya Pradesh on Nath’s remarks against a woman candidate during a poll rally in the state. PTINCW seeks explanationNew Delhi: The National Commission for Women (NCW) on Monday sought an explanation from Congress leader Kamal Nath for his “item” jibe against state minister Imarti Devi. The NCW has also forwarded the matter to the Election Commission for necessary action. PTI“Your silence would compel me to think that you agreed with Nath’s statement,” he said in a letter. Referring to Digvijaya Singh’s “tanch maal” comment on a woman politician from his own party, Union minister Smriti Irani said: “I cannot find any justification that Nath can give for using such derogatory word against a woman leader. I also cannot understand why the Gandhi family chooses to be silent.”Chouhan said Nath committed a shameless act by insulting a woman member of the Scheduled Caste and then attempted to justify the statement.Addressing a poll meeting, Nath said his party candidate was a “simple person” unlike his opponent who is an “item”.Meanwhile, Nath on Monday evening alleged in a letter to Chouhan that the BJP was misleading people. Nath, in his own missive to Chouhan, said, “I didn’t make any disgraceful remarks, but you served lies....The word I said has a lot of meanings. Your party is serving lies and misleading by interpreting the word arbitrarily.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-slams-kamal-nath-over-item-remark-against-minister-imarti-devi-158382

20-10-2020||Saurabh Malik||Punjab and Haryana High Court to examine if death by heart attack after assault is ‘natural’||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 19In a significant order, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed the constitution of a board of senior doctors to examine whether myocardial infarction or heart attack would amount to natural death in cases where assault was alleged.About the caseThe victim was allegedly beaten up and death occurred at subsequent stageHC wants a board of doctors to examine if heart attack amounted to natural death in such casesThe court has called for adoption of more scientific medical investigationCalling for adoption of the more scientific medical investigations, Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan asserted the cause of death of elderly persons, inflicted injuries following fist and kick blows on their abdomen, chest or back, was reported as myocardial infarction in a number of cases.Such type of injuries, being internal, were not visible and went unreported in medico-legal report (MLR) or post-mortem report, if death occurred at a subsequent stage. As such, it was difficult for the courts to form an opinion despite eyewitnesses levelling specific allegation of injuries inflicted following fist or kick blows.Justice Sangwan said the FIR in some cases was registered at the instance of an injured, who gave the “history of assault” before he died. But injury was not noticed while preparing the MLR and conducting the post-mortem examination. It was simply observed external injury was not visible.Justice Sangwan asked Punjab Director-General, Health Services, to constitute the board of senior doctors, experts on the subject matter, to also suggest whether ultrasound scan or any other scientific investigation could be conducted to find out internal injury while conducting MLR/post-mortem examination.The directions came in a case where a cancellation report was prepared and submitted by the police in the trial court after the post-mortem report described the cause of death as myocardial infarction ante-mortem in nature and sufficient to cause death. The victim in the case was allegedly beaten, resulting in injuries on his head and back.Justice Sangwan also asked the board to give opinion on chemical examiner’s report describing the cause of death as myocardial infarction.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-to-examine-if-death-by-heart-attack-after-assault-is-natural-158359
20-10-2020||New Delhi||Stubble: Kejri for monthly meets with Punjab, Haryana||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday requested Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar to hold monthly meetings with the CMs of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and UP to curb air pollution in the National Capital.He said there was a lack of political will at the level of the states to address the problem of stubble burning.In a virtual press briefing, he said the affected states had been unable to find a solution to stop stubble burning and prevent air pollution. The crop residue could be biodegraded or converted into biogas, coal and even cardboard.Kejriwal said he agreed with Javadekar that air pollution was not limited to one state.He, however, added that Javadekar had said it would take at least four years to control pollution, but he believed if all states and political parties "work honestly by keeping aside their political differences then we can check air pollution in much less than four years".He said: “Although scientists and engineers have come out with solutions to reduce the incidents of stubble burning, there is no political will to adopt these methods.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stubble-kejri-for-monthly-meets-with-punjab-haryana-158357

20-10-2020||---||With eye on China, Australia to rejoin Malabar naval exercise||New Delhi, October 19Australia will rejoin the Malabar series of the joint naval exercises scheduled for next month, according to an official announcement here on Monday.The significance of Australia joining the Indo-US-Japan exercise, held every year, could be gauged from statements welcoming the development by the US Navy and the Australian foreign and defence ministers.With the missing element of Australia getting added, Malabar gets converted into a naval force of strength by the four-member Quad grouping of the US, Japan, Australia and India aimed at countering China in the Indo-Pacific. The exercise will take place in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea this year.However, the official news release did not say whether Australia will join as an observer or a permanent member. In case of the former, it would be a one-off affair while the latter means that Quad has formalised into a military group.“As India seeks to increase cooperation with other countries in the maritime security domain and in the light of increased defence cooperation with Australia, Malabar-2020 will see the participation of the Australian Navy,’’ said the official news release.Australian Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said the Malabar drills were a milestone opportunity for the Australian Defence Force.The Malabar series of naval exercises started in 1992 as a bilateral India-US exercise. But its China-oriented focus evolved in the mid-2000 as countries under America’s military umbrella would join as observers. Australia became a part of Malabar for a year over a decade back and then pulled out. But Japan joined in 2015 and Australia’s re-entry was on the cards after Chinese aggression increased on the LAC as well as in the maritime domain.The location of the annual Malabar exercise has also become a point of strategic interest. For instance, it was conducted off the coast of Guam in the Philippine Sea in 2018 and off the coast the Japan in 2019.Australia’s participation in the exercise comes after the foreign minister-level Quad meeting in Tokyo earlier this month.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-eye-on-china-australia-to-rejoin-malabar-naval-exercise-158326
