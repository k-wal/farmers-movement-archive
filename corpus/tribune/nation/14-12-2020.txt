Unfortunately at this point in time, the nurses have gone on a strike,” Guleria said.Besides the demands with regard to the sixth CPC, nurses have also been demanding redressal of issues such as abolishment of gender-based reservation in the recruiting process of nursing officers and contractual appointments, enhancement of hospital accommodation and cadre restructuring.In a letter to the director, the Union said no solid solution was taken by the AIIMS administration and rather their demand related to the 6th central pay commission anomaly was turned down.“Adding to this, it is shocking to know that the AIIMS administration decided to recruit nursing officers on contractual basis immediately which is against our demands,” the Union said in the letter.Guleria said in his message, “Whatever issues you have we will try and resolve amicably and try and be sympathetic to your demand. But at this time of hardship and in this time of trial and tribulation please do not go on strike.”    He said the year 2020 has been declared by the WHO as the year of nurse and midwife as the world celebrates the 200th birth anniversary of Florence Nightingale.“She also insisted that a real nurse would never abandon her patients and I am sure that even in COVID-19, a real nurse will really never abandon her patients or those healthcare workers who are now admitted in our hospital and looking for care,” he said.AIIMS issued a statement stating the nursing union of AIIMS, New Delhi has gone on a strike in contravention of direction of the High Court of Delhi in relation to the code of conduct laid down, whereby no employee or staff or faculty member, will cease work for any reason whatsoever or shout slogans or hold demonstrations within the campus or hold gate meeting within 500 meters radius of the institute boundary.“The various demands raised by the nurses union stand discussed with them for resolution. The union has however abandoned many critically ill patients on the demand of perceived anomaly of fixation of the initial pay related to 6th CPC of the year 2006,” the statement said.The nurses union was apprised that their interpretation is not covered under the existing instructions of the Ministry of Finance, as clarified by the Department of Expenditure, it added.

Rather, for invocation, the borrowers are required to merely submit a request to the lending institutions for being considered under the Resolution Framework,” it submitted.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan – which heard issues relating to various sectors of trade and industry affected by COVID-19 pandemic – would take up the matter on Tuesday.Earlier, the RBI had requested the Supreme Court to vacate its September 4 interim order restraining banks from classifying accounts into non-performing accounts.“We are facing difficulty due to order banning declaring of NPAs," senior advocate V Giri, representing RBI, had told the Bench.Announced by RBI in March for three months, the loan moratorium is a legal authorisation to debtors to postpone payment of EMIs. It was extended to six months till August 31, 2020. The government said more than 50 per cent of the borrowers didn’t avail of the moratorium.Banks, financial and non-banking financial institutions have already credited into the accounts of eligible individual borrowers the difference between compound and simple interest collected on loans of up to Rs 2 crore during the moratorium scheme period.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/borrowers-opting-for-resolution-of-covid-related-stressed-loans-not-required-to-submit-specific-plans-rbi-to-sc-184251

I thought of disclosing it to the parties, in case any of you have any objections to this court hearing the case,” the CJI said.Salve said even he had appeared in the same matter and he have no objection with the CJI led bench hearing the case.Sundaram also concurred with Salve and said they all appear for some company or the others and he also does not have any objection. The CJI said these days such issues potentially create problems at a later stage.The bench noted in its order, “Today when the matter was taken up for hearing, this Court disclosed to the Bar that Shrinivas Bobde, learned counsel, has been appearing on behalf of a subsidiary company of Shapoorji Pallonji Group at Mumbai in a matter regarding slum rehabilitation for about two years.”It said, “Senior counsel/counsel appearing for the parties’ viz.,Harish N. Salve, A.M. Singhvi, C.A. Sundaram, Mohan Parasaran, Shyam Divan, Fereshte D. Sethna, etc., have stated that they have no objection to this Court deciding the present matters.”The bench said the joint statement made by counsel appearing for the parties is being taken on record.Sundaram, who resumed his arguments, referred to various legal provisions and judgements related to winding up of the companies. The hearing remained inconclusive and would continue on Tuesday. Earlier, the Tatas had opposed as “nonsense” the Shapoorji Pallonji Group’s proposal that its 18.37 per cent stake in the Tata Sons, which it claims to be worth Rs 1.75 lakh crore, be swapped with the shares in the Tata group’s listed companies.The SP group is seeking pro-rata shares in Tata group’s listed companies in lieu of its 18.37 per cent stake in Tata Sons Private Ltd (TSPL), the holding company of group firms.Earlier, the Tatas had told the court that the valuation of 18.37 per cent shares owned by the SP Group in Tata Sons is between Rs 70,000 crore and Rs 80,000 crore.The SP Group said however that it was worth Rs 1.75 lakh crore. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tata-mistry-case-cji-discloses-his-son-appears-for-sp-group-firm-lawyers-says-no-objection-184246
14-12-2020||New Delhi||Indian talent can achieve global fame in space sector as it did in IT: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday asserted that the decision to open up India’s space sector has heralded a new age of public-private partnership and expressed confidence that Indian talent will achieve worldwide fame in this field in the same way it did in the IT sector.Interacting with key industries, start-ups and academia from the space sector via video conferencing to encourage their participation in space activities, Modi said professionalism and transparency in policies as well as the decision-making process of the government will prove beneficial for the companies joining the field.In a statement, the PMO said Modi assured the participants of complete and wholehearted support of the government in their efforts. In a tweet, Modi said, “This morning, I had a productive interaction with industry leaders, academicians and the start-up community associated with the space sector. India is making remarkable strides in this sector. This sector has also witnessed path-breaking reforms this year.”Replying to a tweet from Awais Ahmed, CEO of Pixxel who attended the meeting, Modi said, “Space is the space to be in! I assure you, and several others like you, of the constant support from the Government. The reform trajectory in this sector will also continue.”The prime minister spoke of the space sector’s significance in communication and navigation and told the participants that they will be co-passengers with ISRO in this age of space research, expressing hope that the country would soon become the manufacturing hub of space assets, the PMO said.“He said the decision to unlock India’s potential in the space sector has heralded a new age of public-private partnership in this sector,” the PMO said, quoting Modi.Taking note of the plans of companies to make rockets and satellites, he said this marks a big change that will further strengthen India’s foray into the space sector. He said private investment in the sector will lead to the creation of hi-tech jobs, which will provide a host of opportunities to the talent pool in IITs and NITs and other technical institutions.       The prime minister said it is his firm belief that just like Indian talent has been able to attain worldwide fame in the IT sector, it will be able to do so in the space arena as well. Underlining that the space sector reforms are not limited to ensuring ease of doing business, he said necessary mechanisms have also been put in place to ensure help for the participants at each stage, including making available testing facilities and launchpads. He said the endeavour is not only to ensure that India becomes a competitive space market, but also to ensure that the benefits of the space programme reach out to the poorest. He asked the participants to think boldly and work for the benefit of the society and the country, the statement added. The Union Cabinet had in June 2020 decided to open up the space sector to enable the participation of Indian private sector in the entire gamut of space activities. With the creation of Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe), the reforms will provide a level playing field for private companies and start-ups, the PMO said. Subsequently, several ventures have submitted proposals with IN-SPACe under the Department of Space, and they pertain to a vast range of activities, including satellite constellation, small satellite launch vehicles, ground station, geospatial services, propulsion systems and application products, it said. During the interaction, K Sivan, secretary, Department of Space and ISRO Chairman, briefed the prime minister on various proposals received from industry and noted that more than 25 industries have already approached the department for undertaking their space activities. Sunil Bharti Mittal from Bharti Enterprises, Jayant Patil from Larsen & Toubro, Srinath Ravichandran from Agnikul Cosmos, Pawan Kumar Chandana from Skyroot Aerospace, H S Shankar from Alpha Design Technologies, Rakesh Verma from MapmyIndia, Awais Ahmed from PIXXEL India and Srimathy Kesan from Space Kidz India also expressed their views during the session, the PMO said. Appreciating the government’s measures, they also suggested opening up ISRO facilities for children to draw them towards the sector.

It was held three days after the proposal was mooted by Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev during a virtual summit with PM Narendra Modi on December 11.Uzbekistan’s interest in using Chabahar Port marks a flexing point in India’s efforts to carve out a communication route to Afghanistan and Central Asia that outflanks Pakistan.Iran and Uzbekistan welcomed India’s proposal to hold "Chabahar Day” on the sidelines of the International Maritime Summit scheduled to be hosted by India next month, read an MEA statement.In an effort to drain out any political meaning from use of Chabahar Port for trade and transit purposes and enhanced regional connectivity, the trilateral was co-chaired by secretary-level officers from the respective Transport or Shipping Ministries.The Indian side was led by Shipping Secretary Sanjeev Ranjan while Uzbek Deputy Minister of Transport D Dehkanov and Iranian Deputy Transport Minister Shahram Adamnejad led their respective delegations.The trilateral noted the significant role played by Chabahar Port for the region to deliver humanitarian assistance during the Covid pandemic. This included 50,000 tons of foodgrain via the shortest route to western Pashtun, Hazara and Uzbek dominated areas of Afghanistan.Uzbekistan is Central Asia’s most populous nation and has ample reserves of uranium, gold, coal and oil. Some of them could be exported from Chabahar or value added at an adjacent upcoming special economic zone to ports along the Indian Ocean.The subsequent rounds of trilaterals may see Tashkent considering greater involvement in a transportation link to the warm water port of Chabahar. A domino effect is expected and more Central Asian states could join in, said sources.In Afghanistan, India has constructed a road from Zaranj, near the Iranian border, to Delaram which feeds into the Garland Highway connecting Kabul, Kandahar, Mazar-e-Sharif, Herat and Kunduz. This has enabled Indian non-perishable goods to reach Afghanistan by-passing Pakistan which has denied India direct access.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-iran-uzbekistan-hold-meeting-on-joint-use-of-chabahar-port-184242

The list included everything from haircuts to workouts and crisis cooking ideas to cultivating hobbies from scratch, like gardening.“They obsessed over squads in ‘FreeFire’ and imposters in ‘Among Us’ and got inspired by one another to cook ‘Matar Paneer’, try their hand at ‘Hyderabadi Biryani’ and even recreate the classic ‘Dal Tadka’ in their kitchens. Restaurant style cooking, more cooking (without ingredients), baking, workouts (more workouts) were all the rage!” YouTube India added.YouTube, one of most popular online video-sharing platforms, is owned by tech giant Google. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/genda-phool-most-watched-music-video-of-2020-carryminati-top-creator-youtube-india-184239

14-12-2020||New Delhi||SC raps UP Police for casual investigation in murder case||The Supreme Court on Monday pulled up the Uttar Pradesh Police for conducting “casual” investigation in a 2015 case of murder due to alleged political rivalry and appointed an IPS officer to carry out further probe in the matter by selecting officers of his own choice.The apex court noted that FIR in the case was registered in December 2015 and eight investigating officers have been changed but the probe and closure report filed in the case were “extremely casual and perfunctory in nature”.“The investigation appears to be a sham, designed to conceal more than to investigate. The police have the primary duty to investigate on receiving report of the commission of a cognizable offence. This is a statutory duty under the Code of Criminal Procedure apart from being a constitutional obligation to ensure that peace is maintained in the society and the rule of law is upheld and applied,” a Bench headed by Justice RF Nariman said.“We hereby appoint Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj, IPS as the senior officer, state of Uttar Pradesh to carry out further investigation in the matter through a team of competent officers to be selected by him of his own choice. The state shall ensure the availability of such officers,” said the Bench, also comprising Justices Navin Sinha and Krishna Murari.The Bench, while directing that Director General of Police of Uttar Pradesh shall do the needful, said that probe must be concluded within two months from the date of receipt of a copy of its order, unless extension is required, and final report be placed before the apex court.    The top court passed the order on a plea filed by one Amar Nath Chaubey, whose father Ram Bihari Chaubey was shot dead at his residence in village Shrikanthpur in Varanasi on December 4, 2015. Ram Bihari Chaubey had contested the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election in 2012.Amar Nath Chaubey has approached the apex court against the May 2018 order of the Allahabad High Court, which had disposed of his petition seeking CBI inquiry into the murder case alleging that police have conducted the probe in a “lackadaisical manner” as some “powerful political personalities” were involved in the matter.The high court had disposed of his plea while accepting the contention of police that probe in the case would be concluded expeditiously and report would be submitted before the competent court within a period of eight weeks.In its order, the top court observed that investigation is the exclusive privilege and prerogative of the police which cannot be interfered with but if the police does not perform its statutory duty in accordance with law, the court cannot abdicate its duties on the precocious plea that investigation is the exclusive prerogative of the police. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-raps-up-police-for-casual-investigation-in-murder-case-184235

We have multiple langars open here for everyone, but we are also thinking to start a separate one for the women.“We are also making arrangements for water tankers to facilitate their drinking and bathing purposes,” said Kakka, who is associated with the Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh.“Our main purpose is to give women a safe and comfortable environment to stay. After all they are daughters of farmers, they can live anywhere here,” he said.Lakhowal said that with more farmers, especially women, planning to join in the agitation, they are looking for vacant or incomplete buildings as a temporary accommodation for the protesting women.Some good samaritan have also approached them to donate temporary toilets and have offered their flats for temporary accommodation, the farmer leaders said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-2-000-women-from-protesting-farmers-families-to-join-in-arrangements-being-made-184232

India being a signatory of the Paris climate change agreement also has an obligation to reduce/control its carbon footprint,” read the petition.“Combustion of coal itself is the main source of carbon dioxide emission and if the same would be done by cutting dense forest which is the main sink of CO2 then it would have a sort of quadrupled impact on the environment,” the petitioner contended.“The allotment of other major mineral deposits as well is being done in routine manner without classifying the same in different categories on the basis of environmental value and exploiting the less damaging one at the first instance and saving the pristine area that is compromising the environmental security of the nation," Shrivastava submitted.As a result, areas where environmental damage would be least due to mining  are not being considered and 100 per cent dense forest which are catchment of important rivers are made available for mining, the petitioner alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-centre-seven-states-on-pil-against-mining-in-no-go-areas-184227

14-12-2020||---||Pollution: SC seeks to know steps taken by air quality panel||New Delhi, December 14The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to spell out the steps taken by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and adjoining areas to deal with the problem of air pollution.Headed by former Delhi Chief Secretary MM Kutty, the Commission started functioning last month. It has jurisdiction over NCR, including areas in Haryana, Punjab, UP and Rajasthan with regard to air pollution. According to an Ordinance issued by the Centre, the Commission supersedes all other bodies/authorities set up through judicial orders or otherwise on air quality management and in case of a conflict between orders of the Commission and those issues by state governments, the Commission’s orders will prevail. It also replaces the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) constituted by the Supreme Court more than two decades ago.As PILs on air pollution were taken up for hearing, Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, representing the Centre, sought two days from a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, saying the government was in the process of preparing a comprehensive affidavit for filing.“You file your affidavit,” the Bench said, adding it should have details of steps taken till now by the Commission. It posted the matter for hearing on December 17.During the hearing, senior counsel Vikash Singh alleged that the Commission had not done anything.“The committee has 14 members but they have not done anything. They should file some affidavit,” Singh submitted on behalf of petitioner Aditya Dubey who highlighted pollution caused by stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and western UP.The Bench turned down Singh’s plea for allowing mentioning of urgent matters via video conferencing. “We don’t have so many links (of video-conferencing),” the CJI told Singh.As the newly constituted Commission for Air Quality Management (AQM) in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas started functioning, the Supreme Court had on November 6 asked the Centre to ensure there was no smog in Delhi.“We are a court of law. This is a problem which has to be dealt with by the Executive. They have the money, the power and the resources for this. We are not abdicating our responsibility or functions but understand this, we have some limitations,” the Bench had noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pollution-sc-seeks-to-know-steps-taken-by-air-quality-panel-184219

14-12-2020||---||Data protection: WhatsApp denies in SC allegations of data hacking by spyware Pegasus||New Delhi, December 14WhatsApp on Monday denied in the Supreme Court the allegations that its data can be hacked by Israeli sypware Pegasus, which had led to a controversy last year over breach of privacy following claims that Indian journalists and human rights activists were among those globally spied upon by unnamed entities.The issue cropped up before a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, which was hearing a plea filed by Rajya Sabha MP Binoy Viswam seeking direction to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for framing regulation to ensure that data collected on UPI platforms is not “exploited” or used in any manner other than for processing payments.“An allegation is that WhatsApp data can be hacked by a software called Pegasus,” the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, told senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who was appearing for WhatsApp.Sibal said: “These are all allegations. None of them are correct”.          WhatsApp had said last year that it was suing an Israeli surveillance firm that is reportedly behind the technology that helped unnamed entities’ spies to hack into phones of roughly 1,400 users.During the hearing conducted through video-conferencing on Monday, senior advocate Krishnan Venugopal, appearing for Viswam, told the bench that RBI has filed an affidavit in the matter and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) should also make its stand clear in the matter.“Additional safeguards should be there. WhatsApp’s security is not up to the mark and the third point is of data localisation. Data is being shared by companies like Facebook, WhatsApp and Amazon. This is a breach of privacy. All the data are being shared in violation of the NPCI norms,” Venugopal said.He referred to the Pegasus controversy and said that WhatsApp’s data can be hacked by the spyware.The counsel appearing for NPCI said that he would file an affidavit in the matter.The bench has posted the matter for further hearing in the fourth week of January.On October 15, the apex court had sought responses from the Centre, RBI, NPCI and others including Google Inc, Facebook Inc, WhatsApp and Amazon Inc on the plea.Viswam, the Communist Party of India (CPI) leader, has sought a direction to the RBI and the NPCI to ensure that data collected on Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platforms is not shared with their parent company or any other third party under any circumstances.“In India, the UPI payments system is being regulated and supervised by Respondent no. 1 (RBI) and Respondent no. 2 (NPCI), however the RBI and the NPCI instead of fulfilling their statutory obligations and protecting and securing the sensitive data of users are compromising the interest of the Indian users by allowing the non-compliant foreign entities to operate its payment services in India,” the plea has alleged.“The RBI and NPCI have permitted the three members of ‘Big Four Tech Giants’ i.e. Amazon, Google and Facebook/WhatsApp (Beta phase) to participate in the UPI ecosystem without much scrutiny and in spite of blatant violations of UPI guidelines and RBI regulations,” it has claimed.The plea has alleged that this conduct of RBI and NPCI put the sensitive financial data of Indian users at huge risks, especially when these entities have been “continuously accused of abusing dominance and compromising data”, among other things.It has further sought a direction that RBI and NPCI should ensure that WhatsApp is not permitted to launch full scale operations of ‘WhatsApp Pay’ in India without fulfilling all legal compliances to the satisfaction of the court regarding requisite regulatory compliances.It said that in April 2018, the RBI, with a view to secure the data of Indian users, had issued a circular directing all system providers to ensure that entire data relating to payment systems operated by them are stored in systems only in India and they were asked to ensure compliance by October 15, 2018.The plea claimed that later, the RBI toned down the April 2018 circular by issuing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and permitted processing of all payment transaction abroad, including domestic transactions.In the said FAQ it was clarified that in cases of data processing done abroad, the data should be deleted from the systems abroad and brought back to India within 24 hours, the plea said.It has sought the apex court’s direction to declare the FAQ dated June 26, 2019 issued by the RBI as ultra vires to the circular dated April 6, 2018.It alleged that Google and Facebook already have access to “immense personal data of millions of Indian users” and if they are permitted to collect “unrestricted financial data” of Indian users while operating at the UPI platform, the same would give them “draconian control” over sensitive Indian data. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/data-protection-whatsapp-denies-in-sc-allegations-of-data-hacking-by-spyware-pegasus-184216

This has been done keeping in mind the security requirements of the protectee in the wake of the recent attack on his vehicle that was part of a convoy of BJP president JP Nadda,” an official source said.The CISF has been providing ‘Z’ category VIP security cover to Vijayvargiya since February last year. The protection includes a mobile team of about six-seven armed CISF commandos as well as a pilot and an escort vehicle.Vijayvargiya’s vehicle was attacked with stones during a visit to Diamond Harbour area in the state’s South 24 Parganas district on December 10 when he was accompanying the BJP president.Vijayvargiya confirmed his security upgrade to reporters after he arrived in Kolkata on Monday afternoon to take part in a programme at Mathurapur in South 24 Parganas.“As per the order of the Union Home Ministry, I have been provided with a bulletproof vehicle,” he told the media at the airport.On December 10, several vehicles in Nadda’s cavalcade were damaged in the attack.

His portrayal as a rapist, corrupt and drug dealer has diminished the place saints hold for Hindus,” Khandelwal contended in his petition.Khandelwal had earlier complained to the police, seeking registration of an FIR against the duo, but with the police refusing to lodge any case over his complaint, he had moved the court of the additional chief judicial magistrate with the same plea.With the ACJMM too dismissing his plea, Khandelwal approached the Jodhpur district and session judge challenging the ACJJM’s decision.The second season of the web series ‘Aashram Chapter 2 -- The Dark Side’ had been released on November 11, but the series has attracted condemnation for the controversial portrayal of Hindu saints in it.A social media campaign had also been launched terming it to be a malicious portrayal of Hindu religious culture and ‘ashrams’.

14-12-2020||New Delhi||Over 30% women suffered spousal violence in five states: Survey||Over 30 per cent women suffered physical and sexual violence by their spouses in five out of 22 surveyed states and Union Territories in the country, according to the National Family Health Survey-5, with activists and NGOs fearing its further rise in view of COVID-19 pandemic.The five states are Karnataka, Assam, Mizoram, Telangana and Bihar.The survey was conducted in 6.1 lakh sample households, involving household-level interviews, to collect information on population, health, family planning and nutrition related indicators.About 44.4 per cent women aged 18-49 years experienced domestic violence by their spouses in Karnataka, said the survey.Under NFHS-4 (2015-16), 20.6 per cent women in the state had said that they faced spousal violence.About 40 per cent women in Bihar, 39 per cent in Manipur, 36.9 per cent in Telangana, 32 per cent in Assam and 30 per cent in Andhra Pradesh suffered spousal physical and sexual violence, the data showed.A total of seven states and UTs out of the 22 surveyed reported an increase in domestic violence faced by women aged 18-49 years in NFHS-5 as compared to NFHS-4.These seven states/UTs include Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Sikkim, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.In nine states/UTs, there was an increase in the percentage of women aged 18-29 years who said that they faced sexual violence by the age of 18, the data revealed.These places are Assam, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa, Meghalaya, Sikkim, West Bengal, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.Activists and NGOs have attributed the high percentage of women suffering from domestic violence to low rate of literacy, high consumption of alcohol, among others.Poonam Muttreja, Public Health Expert and Executive Director of Population Foundation of India, said the increase in spousal violence which had come to light in the major states was very disturbing as it suggested a culture of violence prevalent across regions."India as a society has been rooted in patriarchy practiced over decades which encourages domestic violence.“According to NFHS-4, 31 per cent of ever-married women had experienced physical, sexual or emotional spousal violence. As is evident from the newly released NFHS-5 data, the situation has got further exacerbated since the last survey. The fact that this data is from the pre-COVID-19 era shows that a pandemic of violence was prevalent much before COVID-19 and its ramifications unfolded," she said."The spread of coronavirus this year has increased incidents of domestic violence. India's public health system must view domestic violence as a public health concern and respond to it on an urgent basis. We must act now and not merely react each time the evidence stares at us," Muttreja added.Women rights activist Shamina Shafiq said the government needed to talk strongly about domestic violence."Unfortunately, a man feels it is his right to beat a woman and he enjoys the fact that he is the one in control of the life of another person. Even today, the government is unable to talk about how bad it is to subject any person to violence. There should be writing on the wall that spousal violence is wrong," she said.Yogita Bhayana, who heads the People Against Rapes in India (PARI), said the high rate of domestic violence might also be because of high awareness among women to talk about the abuse and report the same."There has been an increase (in such incidents) because there is also an increase in awareness among women… they are getting more proactive reporting it and talking about it. Earlier they used to suppress their grievances and the government is also spreading awareness and women get motivated by other women reporting it.“Because of social media the reporting of domestic violence has increased. Women have become more vocal and they have less tolerance which is very good. Moreover, despite several dilutions the domestic violence Act is still very strong," she said.The NFHS-5 results of 17 states and five UTs have been released under Phase 1 of the survey. The survey's Phase 2 covering other states will be released next year, the Health Ministry had said.

14-12-2020||New Delhi||Govt issues guidelines for COVID-19 vaccination drive||Vaccinating 100-200 people in each session per day, monitoring them for 30 minutes after administering the shots for any adverse event and allowing only one beneficiary at a time are among the guidelines issued by the Centre for the COVID-19 inoculation drive.According to the guidelines issued to states recently, the COVID Vaccine Intelligence Network (Co-WIN) system—a digitalised platform—will be used to track enlisted beneficiaries for the vaccination and anti-coronavirus vaccines on a real-time basis.At the vaccination site, only pre-registered beneficiaries will be vaccinated in accordance with the prioritisation, and there will be no provision for on the-spot registrations.The states have been asked, as far as possible, to allocate the vaccine from one manufacturer to a district to avoid mixing of different COVID-19 vaccines in the field.As per the ‘COVID-19 Vaccine Operational Guidelines’, all measures should be taken to avoid exposing the vaccine carrier, vaccine vials or ice packs to direct sunlight, the document stated.Vaccines and diluents should be kept inside the vaccine carrier with the lid closed until a beneficiary comes to the centre for vaccination.“There may not be vaccine vial monitors (VVM) and Date of Expiry on the label of COVID-19 vaccine, this should not discourage vaccinators from using the vaccine. At the end of the session, the vaccine carrier with all ice packs and unopened vaccine vials should be sent back to the distributing cold chain point,” the guidelines said.States have been asked to implement an integrated 360-degree comprehensive advocacy communication and social mobilisation strategy to address the challenges surrounding vaccine rollout progress and benefits.The Centre has stated that the country stands on the cusp of COVID-19 vaccine administration, even as certain challenges need to be countered well in time.“These may include the challenge of ensuring over 1.3 billion people in India receive factual and timely information and updates on vaccine rollout progress and benefits, public’s anxiety and queries regarding government’s decision for prioritisation of vaccine administration, apprehension about the vaccines introduced after a short trial raising safety concerns, and fear of adverse events, misconception about vaccine efficacy, rumours and negative narrative in media/social media space and laxity observed in public adherence to COVID appropriate behaviour,” the document stated.The vaccination team will consist of five members, it said.Each session should be planned for 100 beneficiaries per day. If the session site has adequate logistics and space available for waiting room and observation room along with arrangement for crowd management, one more vaccinator officer can be added to create a session for 200 beneficiaries, the guidelines stated.The COVID-19 vaccine will be offered first to healthcare workers, frontline workers and to persons above 50 years of age, followed by persons younger than 50 years of age with associated comorbidities based on the evolving pandemic situation, and finally to the remaining population based on the disease epidemiology and vaccine availability.The priority group of above 50 years may be further subdivided into those above 60 years of age and those between 50 to 60 years of age for purposes of phasing of rollout based on the pandemic situation and vaccine availability.“The latest electoral roll for Lok Sabha and legislative assembly election will be used to identify the population aged 50 years or more,” the guidelines stated.Under phase one of the vaccination, it is planned to vaccinate nearly 30 crore population.Twelve photo-identity documents, including Voter ID, Aadhar card, driving license, passport and pension document, will be required for self-registration on the Co-WIN website, it added.

14-12-2020||Indore||Demands for renaming certain areas justified, says MP minister||Amid demands by some leaders of the ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh to change names of certain places, state Culture Minister Usha Thakur on Monday said such demands are absolutely valid if they are backed by “facts and evidences”.Some leaders of the BJP from Bhopal and Indore have demanded that the existing names of some areas be changed.“This is a period of renaissance. If the names of some places in the state are changed on the basis of facts and evidence, and in accordance with the Constitution, then these changes must surely take place. Nobody should have any objection,” the minister told reporters here.She further said, “The ‘Azad Bharat’ (Independent India) should look like Azad Bharat”.MP Assembly Speaker and senior BJP leader Rameshwar Sharma recently demanded that the name of Idgah Hills in Bhopal be changed to “Guru Nanak Tekri”.Indore Lok Sabha MP Shankar Lalwani had said that local people wanted the area adjacent to the famous Ganesh temple in Khajrana locality be renamed, either as Ganesh Nagar, Ganesh Dham or Ganesh Colony.“Now we have to decide together whether we trust the history of 1,400 years or the history of 14,000 years?” Thakur said.“There is no fabrication....if demand for changes of names of places is coming from Bhopal and other cities… These demands have been made on the basis of facts and evidence,” the minister said.Thakur further said the people who believe in democracy have been asking the state government to gather facts to ascertain validity of their demands for renaming the places.“...A certain class of society, however, doesn’t worry about this (renaming a locality). They just plant a board mentioning the change of the name of their area,” she said.Queried about the ongoing stir of farmers on the borders of Delhi for a repeal of three farm laws, Thakur said, “I think those high-ranking middlemen who were earning huge money before these laws (were enacted), are stoking farmers agitation as part of a conspiracy.

14-12-2020||New Delhi||TractortoTwitter: Sydney-based IT professional from Ludhiana taking on ‘fake news’ against protest||When he came to India from Australia’s Sydney in October for some personal work, taking a break from his job in the IT industry there, Bhavjit Singh had no plans to overstay.                  But the IT professional from Punjab’s Ludhiana finds himself here in the month of December, running a Twitter campaign to take on those spreading “fake news and running vilification campaigns” against the ongoing farmers’ protest.The Twitter handle — Tractor2twitr — has garnered 2.5 million impressions from across the globe since November 28.The farmers’ protest at multiple entry points to the national capital began on November 26, driven mainly by the food-growers from Punjab and Haryana.“I had come to India in October-end to attend to some personal work, but then this (farmers’ protest) happened and I stayed on,” Bhavjit Singh says. He said his idea was to disseminate authentic information about the protest as a “lot of people have been tweeting, running a vilification campaign against the movement”.His friend and a volunteer, Jaspreet Singh, says, “Paid and motivated users dominate and encroach up on the Twitter space. Our campaign is an effort to counter them.”“Farmers don’t know how to operate Twitter. We wanted to connect them to it. We don’t have an IT cell, all tweets are ‘organic’,” he says.Also, when the international media want to know what is happening in India, they don’t go to Facebook or WhatsApp, they logon to Twitter to see what is trending, Bhavjit Singh adds.“When the anti-farmer campaign was at its peak, we thought it was time that the farmers moved from tractor to Twitter. The name of the handle – tractor2twtr – just came out from nowhere,” he says.Bhavjit Singh says the Twitter handle is being operated by volunteers from all across the globe.“Everybody is an administrator.”              The posts from the handle receive more than one lakh retweets daily on an average, he claims.“We have consolidated our power, our presence on Twitter. Now, we are giving those running a vilification campaign a tough fight,” he says.Farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.They are on a day-long fast on Monday even as the agitation spread to different parts of the country with peasant unions staging demonstrations at district headquarters.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tractortotwitter-sydney-based-it-professional-from-ludhiana-taking-on-fake-news-against-protest-184190

14-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||Tomar meets farmers ‘supporting agri laws’; says govt’s 'intention and policy' clear||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 15Amid intensifying resistance to the three Central Farm Acts, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on met farmer  leaders from different states, including Telangana, Maharashtra, Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Bihar, who not only supported the legislations — calling them pro-farmer and urging the government to not repeal them, but also termed the “agitation by Punjab farmers politically motivated”.Tomar later said members of the All India Kisan Coordination Committee called the “laws completely in favour of farmers and urged that they should not be taken back at any cost. They also said the protests by Punjab farmers are completely politically motivated”. He said “intention and policy of the government is clear and farmers are already benefiting from pro-farmer reforms which will help in increasing the income of farmers. The Government is always ready to engage in dialogue”.While farmer unions from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and other parts are supporting, the movement is facing some issues. Apart from allegations of “Khalistan, Ultra-Left and pro-Left Wing extremist elements “hijacking the farmers’ movement” — charges that unions and ‘jathebandis’ reject vehemently), some are also pointing towards “symbols and undertones of a particular religion overtaking protest sites”. ‘Jathebandi’ leaders hit back saying “BJP’s mindset is such it cannot understand secular issues”.Now that it is almost clear that laws will not be repealed, it is also becoming increasingly evident that the government is fighting back constructing evidence in favour of the laws through the same section that is opposing the laws. This is not the first time favourable unions have extended support on the three laws. Earlier, unions from Haryana called on Tomar, threatening to protest if the pro-farmer laws are repealed.An official statement said farmers’ representatives expressed “gratitude to the government for enacting the Acts and urged it to give in to the demands of agitating farmers”, rather “educate” them on their benefits through advertisements and training programmes.“They will benefit farmers across India and save them from the clutches of middlemen who exploited them for years. They said the laws will give them freedom of choice in sale and purchase and allow barrier-free trade and commerce outside the APMC. They will enable farmers to access modern technology, better seeds and inputs, besides attracting private investment into the agriculture sector,” it said quoting farmers.The 7,000 NGOs under the umbrella of the All India Kisan Coordination Committee will all rise up to support the Acts, it added.Meanwhile, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and union ministers from Punjab, Hardeep Puri and Som Prakash, also held meetings on the issue. Reaching out to farmers, Rajnath Singh also said the government is always willing to listen to farmers and open for dialogue. However, so far there is no breakthrough regarding the next meeting between the government and warring factions.BJP leaders said “people across the country have given their verdict in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and decisions of his government”. Citing recent wins, party spokesperson Sambit Patra said BJP’s spate of victories in elections across the country would not have been possible without the “help of farmers and the poor”. Slamming Opposition — Congress and AAP, for “their duplicity and misleading farmers”, he said the BJP will dismantle their claim scientifically.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tomar-meets-farmers-supporting-agri-laws%C2%A0says-govts-intention-and-policy-clear-184184

It is the longest highway tunnel in the world."It is desired that the knowledge of this technological marvel of the country, encompassing the best practices in engineering, design, planning, construction and project management be disseminated to students of engineering colleges who should be encouraged to visit this tunnel to see, appreciate and assimilate the capabilities in tunnelling efforts which now exist within the country," he added.The tunnel is built with ultra-modern specifications in the Pir Panjal range of the Himalayas at an altitude of 3,000 metres.The south portal of Atal Tunnel is located at a distance of 25 km from Manali at an altitude of 3,060 metres, while its north portal is located near village Teling, Sissu, in Lahaul Valley at an altitude of 3,071 metres.

They have no place in India," Chadha said.Reacting to Chadha's comments, Delhi BJP spokesperson Virender Babbar said everybody supported farmers, including the BJP."Chadha should tell what would you call those who talk about killing the prime minister and demand the release of people arrested under sedition charge," Babbar said.Several Union ministers have repeatedly alleged that the farmers' protests have been hijacked by Maoists, Leftists and anti-national elements, a charge denied by the farmers' union leaders spearheading the agitation.On Sunday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also expressed his anguish over the issue, saying that some Central ministers and BJP leaders were labelling protesting farmers as "traitors and anti-nationals"."I want to ask them, if so many ex-servicemen, sportspersons of national and international level, singers and celebrities, lawyers and traders supporting and joining the farmers, are all anti-national?" he questioned.The farmers have been camping at several border points of Delhi for close to three weeks now against the three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September.The farm laws have been projected by the Central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

14-12-2020||New Delhi||45 years on, SC to examine whether to declare Emergency 'unconstitutional'||More than 45 years after thousands of people were jailed across India under an Emergency imposed by the Indira Gandhi-government on the grounds of 'internal disturbance', the Supreme Court on Monday decided to examine if the June 26, 1975 proclamation can be declared unconstitutional.However, a Bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said, "We would be disinclined to open all such aspects as there may have been wrongs done to persons but with the passage of almost 45 years, it would not be appropriate to re-open all those issues."But the Bench said it was not disinclined to see if a simpliciter declaration -- "something which is feasible or desirable after a passage of time and issue, restricted to that aspect" -- could be issued.It asked the petitioner to amend her petition and put all facts on record by December 18.The top court issued notice to the Centre asking it to respond to a petition filed by Veena Sarin - a 94-year-old woman - who urged it to declare the Emergency unconstitutional and grant her a compensation of Rs 25 crores after senior advocate Harish Salve, representing the petitioner, said he felt very strongly about the issue."If history is not corrected, it repeats itself. Please examine this issue," contended Salve who passionately argued the matter to persuade the top court to consider it."This is a matter of constitutional debate and principles must be laid down on fraud upon the Constitution, that no matter how high you are, you will be held accountable," Salve argued."I feel very strongly on this issue. If your lordships recall we were students at the time of the proclamation of emergency in 1975. This is why I am appearing in this matter...This is too important a matter. Our generation is still around," he submitted.Pointing out that people were in detention for months together under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA), Salve said the petitioner wanted a declaration that the emergency was unconstitutional."We are finding it difficult to go into this. The emergency was an abuse and something happened which ought not to have happened... We can't keep digging on these issues, persona's are gone today," Justice Kaul observed during the hearing.But Salve pointed out that "Today, even war-crime issues are considered and 90-year-olds are hauled up for crimes. In nascent stage of our democracy, rights were suspended for 19 months," he said urging the top court to consider the issue.Salve said the 94-year-old woman was not a political person. "We are angry... our friends were put in jail during the Emergency. The abuse of power was so enormous, it has scarred our country. Your lordships must declare that the Emergency proclamation was wrong," Salve submitted.Petitioner Veena Sarin has submitted that her petition was “a genuine desire to bring about an end to the undemocratic nightmare, infamously known as ‘the emergency’ and to seek “a peaceful closure, that can be brought only by an acknowledgement and declaration by the highest court of justice of the country in which citizens repose the highest level of confidence and faith, that the said incident was unconstitutional.”She relied on the 2017 judgment in KS Puttaswamy case which overruled the top court’s infamous decision in ADM Jabalpur versus Shivkant Shukla (1976).She said, "the present petition is a plea for justice and restitution of a lifetime spent in utter misery and anguish on account of the atrocities suffered by the petitioner, her deceased husband and her family".Recounting her agony, she said in their bid to plunder businesses and homes of victims, the government authorities had targeted her and her husband with unjustifiable and arbitrary detention orders which forced them to flee India."His business was shut down, assets and valuables including immovable property were seized and appropriated. The Petitioner's husband succumbed to the pressure and died. Since then the Petitioner has been single-handedly facing all proceedings initiated against her husband during the Emergency period, which were arbitrarily pursued, she submitted.Sarin said the compensation money should be recovered from the authorities who have participated in misuse of powers during the Emergency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/45-years-on-sc-to-examine-whether-to-declare-emergency-unconstitutional-184167

14-12-2020||---||SC to hear in January plea of Kerala Journalists’ body against arrest of scribe on way to Hathras||New Delhi, December 14The Supreme Court would now hear in the third week of January the plea of Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) questioning the arrest of scribe Siddique Kappan on his way to Hathras where a young Dalit woman had died after allegedly being gang-raped.A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde on Monday granted opportunity to the journalists’ body to file its response to the additional affidavit of the Uttar Pradesh government in the case and fixed the plea for hearing next year.The bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, did not agree to the submission of senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing the KUWJ, that the case be listed in the first week of January instead of third on reopening of courts after the winter break.“First two weeks (in January) are miscellaneous (weeks when fresh matters will be heard),” the bench said in a hearing conducted through video conferencing.Earlier, the Uttar Pradesh government had told the bench that “shocking findings” have emerged in the investigation so far in the case in which Kappan was arrested on his way to Hathras.Kappan claimed that he was working as a journalist in a Kerala-based daily but that newspaper was closed two years back and investigation conducted so far has found some shocking findings, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had told the bench.The KUWJ, which has been questioning Kappan’s arrest, had refused to approach the Allahabad High Court as suggested by the apex court for seeking bail and other reliefs.We would like to argue the matter in the Apex Court itself and implead Kappan’s wife and others in the plea, Sibal had said.“The high court has granted one month’s time on the habeas corpus plea of other accused in the same case and I want to argue here,” Sibal had said, adding, “Hear me finally”.The Uttar Pradesh government recently filed an affidavit in the Apex Court claiming that Kappan was going to Hathras under the “garb of journalism” with a “very determined design” to create caste divide and disturb law and order situation.The state has alleged in its affidavit that Kappan is the office secretary of the Popular Front of India (PFI) and was using a “journalist cover” by showing identity card of a Kerela-based newspaper which was closed in 2018.In its counter affidavit filed in the matter, the KUWJ has urged the Apex Court that an independent inquiry be conducted by a retired top court judge to determine the facts of the alleged “illegal arrest and detention” of Kappan.The KUWJ has claimed that Uttar Pradesh Police has made an “absolute false and incorrect statement” that Kappan is the office secretary of PFI as he is working as a journalist only.In its rejoinder affidavit, KUWJ has alleged that the state filed a “misleading affidavit, misrepresenting the facts in order to justify their illegal and unlawful detention and malicious prosecution” of Kappan and there are no materials to support the allegations against him.It has said Kappan had attempted to visit Hathras on October 5 in discharge of his journalistic duties and he had intimated his employer prior to his trip.Kappan was arrested on October 5 while he was on his way to Hathras, home to the 19-year-old Dalit woman who died after being allegedly gang-raped by four upper-caste men.The police had said it has arrested four people having alleged links with the PFI in Mathura and identified the arrested persons as Siddique from Malappuram, Atiq-ur Rehman from Muzaffarnagar, Masood Ahmed from Bahraich and Alam from Rampur.The FIR has been filed under various provisions of the IPC and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against four people having alleged links with the PFI.The PFI had been accused in the past of funding protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act across the country earlier this year.Hathras was in the news following the death of Dalit woman who was allegedly gang-raped on September 14, 2020, in a village in the district.Her cremation at night by the authorities, allegedly without the parents’ consent, had triggered widespread outrage.

14-12-2020||New Delhi||Apprise about steps taken so far by Commission for Air Quality Management: SC to Centre||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to apprise it about the steps taken so far by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas to tackle air pollution.A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde was told by Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, that the government was readying a comprehensive affidavit to be filed in the apex court in the matter.“You file your affidavit,” said the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.The top court said the affidavit should have details of what steps had been taken till now by the Commission.During the proceedings conducted through video-conferencing, the Apex Court, which was hearing the matters relating to air pollution in Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR), was told that the Commission had not done anything.“The committee has 14 members but they have not done anything. They should file some affidavit,” senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for petitioner Aditya Dubey who has raised the issue of pollution caused due to stubble burning in neighbouring states of Delhi, said.To this, Bhati said: “Our affidavit is ready. Give us two-day indulgence.”One of the lawyers appearing in the matter claimed that stubble burning has risen by five per cent.“We are readying a comprehensive affidavit,” Bhati told the bench, which posted the matter for hearing on December 17.At the outset, Singh told the bench that mentioning of urgent matter is not being allowed in the Apex Court at present.“We don’t have so many links (of video-conferencing),” the bench said.On November 6, the Apex Court had asked the Centre to ensure there was no smog in Delhi as it was informed that the Commission had started functioning from that day.The pollution problem had to be dealt with by the executive as it has the power, money and resources for this, the top court had said.The Centre had earlier appointed former Chief Secretary of Delhi MM Kutty as the chairperson of the Commission.The Centre had told the Apex Court that there were experts from the field besides members from NGOs in the newly created Commission.On October 29, the top court was informed by the Centre that it had come out with an ordinance on curbing pollution and it has been promulgated already.The top court had said it would have to look at the Ordinance before passing any direction in the matter which had raised issues regarding pollution caused due to stubble burning in neighbouring states of Delhi.The Apex Court had on October 26 kept in abeyance its earlier order appointing one-man panel of retired apex court judge Justice Madan B Lokur to monitor the steps taken by neighbouring states to prevent stubble burning which is a major cause of pollution in the Delhi-national capital region (NCR).The Apex Court had kept in abeyance its order appointing Justice (retd) Lokur panel while considering the Centre’s stand that it was coming out with a comprehensive legislation to deal with air pollution, including the aspect of stubble burning.During his tenure as an apex court judge, Justice Lokur who headed social-justice bench had dealt with pollution matters which included the aspect of stubble burning.The top court is also hearing a separate plea filed in 1985 by environmentalist M C Mehta on air pollution and had last year even taken a suo motu note of alarming rise in air pollution in Delhi-NCR where several directions have been passed with regard to stubble burning.

We are, however, always willing to listen to our farmer brothers, allay their misgivings and provide them with assurances we can provide," Singh said.Calling agriculture the mother sector, he said the government is always open to discussion and dialogue to resolve issues.Also read: Agri Minister Tomar holds consultations with farmers"Agriculture has been one sector which has been able to avoid the adverse effects of the pandemic and, in fact, come out the best. Our produce and procurement have been plentiful and our warehouses are full. There is no question of taking retrograde steps against our agricultural sector ever," he said.Rajnath said India's armed forces stood up to aggression along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh and fought the Chinese military with "utmost bravery", forcing it to go back.In an address at the annual general meeting of industry chamber FICCI, Singh said the "unprovoked aggression" on India's Himalayan frontiers is a reminder of how the world is changing and how existing agreements are being challenged."They fought the PLA (Peoples Liberation Army) with utmost bravery and forced them to go back. The coming generations of this nation will be proud of what our forces have managed to achieve this year," the defence minister said.Without elaborating, Singh said Indian armed forces had shown exemplary courage and remarkable fortitude in dealing with the challenge."The unprovoked aggression on our Himalayan frontiers is a reminder of how the world is changing, how existing agreements are being challenged, how power is being asserted not just in the Himalayas but across the Indo-Pacific," Singh said."And how uncertain the future of the region and world could be in this backdrop? As you are aware, there is a big build-up of armed forces at the LAC in Ladakh," he said.

14-12-2020||New Delhi||Fast in support of protesting farmers, appeals Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday appealed to people to fast wherever they are in support of protesting farmers, and asserted that farmers would win in the end.Kejriwal is holding a one-day fast in support of the farmers' protest on Monday.Farmer leaders are observing a day-long hunger strike as part of their protest against the three farm laws.The Chief Minister also urged his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) volunteers, supporters, as well as the people of the country to join the farmers' agitation."Fasting is sacred. Wherever you are, fast for our farmer brothers. Pray to God for the success of their struggle. In the end, farmers will definitely win," Kejriwal tweeted.Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said he is observing the fast at the party office with other party members."The Anndaata farmer of the country is on hunger strike demanding the withdrawal of the three laws of the central government for the sake of saving his daily bread. In support of the demand of farmers, today I am also on a fast with all my colleagues in the Aam Aadmi Party office," Sisodia tweeted.Apart from Sisodia, AAP ministers and MLAs, including Gopal Rai, Satyendar Jain, Atishi and Raghav Chadha, also observed fast at the party office here in support of farmers.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who had recently gone there, is expected to be there again next week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/left-watches-closely-as-bjp-trinamool-fight-it-out-for-political-space-in-west-bengal-184141
14-12-2020||Washington||US court rejects bail plea of 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana||A US court has denied the bail plea of Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, a key accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack and declared a fugitive by India, asserting that he has not negated the "risk of flight".Rana, 59, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was rearrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed.Pakistani-American LeT terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Chooljian, the US District Court of Los Angeles, in his order on December 10 said that Rana "presented a robust bail package" and offered conditions that significantly mitigate the risk of flight.But the "Court cannot find that he has negated the risk of flight" and as such granted the request of the US government to the continued detention of Rana.Meanwhile, the US government in the court has supported India's request that the documents submitted by it in support of extradition of Rana be not made public.The extradition documents presented by India apparently include information about Rana's involvement in the Mumbai terrorist attack that would be shared with him."Although the United States has no affirmative discovery obligations in extradition matters, in this case, it has agreed to provide Rana with a document in its possession from an unrelated 'state court' proceeding in India. India has requested that the United States take steps to limit public dissemination of this document," US Attorney Nicola T Hanna said in a court submission on Friday.Rana has informed the United States that he may seek to introduce materials provided as discovery and labelled "general discovery materials" and "sensitive discovery materials" in United States v Kashmiri, Case in opposition of the United States' Request for Extradition. These discovery materials are subject to a protective order issued in the Northern District of Illinois, it said.In his December 10 order, the judge said Rana was currently facing multiple criminal charges emanating from India in connection with alleged conduct by him that at least to some degree overlaps with and formed a basis for federal criminal charges on which Rana was tried in Chicago and relates to the November 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai.Rana in his bail plea said that his health is in poor condition, including two heart attack while in custody and two weeks of illness early this year. Rana argued that he was not a danger to the community – which was opposed by the US government.The judge noted that Rana did not perform any violent acts himself and instead provided material support to the Denmark plot by furnishing Headley with business cards, supporting his business cover, and providing him with logistical support for his travels and plots.The nature of the offences charged in India – which relate to the Mumbai attack – also weigh in favour of finding that Rana is a danger to the community, though the weight of the evidence on the same is far less conclusive, she wrote.The Conspiracy to Commit Murder and Murder charges are obviously extremely serious and the letters filed by the government bring home the devastating impact the Mumbai attack had and continue to have on the victims and their families, the judge wrote.The weight of the evidence presented to date against Rana on such charges is not overwhelming. The other two charges – Conspiracy to Commit Forgery for the Purpose of Cheating and the Conspiracy to Use as Genuine a Forged Document or Electronic Record – is far less serious in and of themselves – but the weight of the evidence presented to date against Rana as to those charges is far stronger, Chooljian wrote.There is no question in the Court's mind that given Rana's significant foreign ties, particularly to Canada, and the potential death penalty awaiting him in India if he is extradited on and convicted of the most serious pending charges, that Rana is a flight risk, the judge wrote.

Also, they have given a call to stage dharnas at district headquarters across the country.Photographs of some protesters at the Tikri border seen holding posters demanding the release of activists arrested under various charges had gone viral, prompting Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar to say that these "anti-social elements" are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the peasants' movement under the guise of farmers."We did nothing wrong. We had just organised an event demanding their (jailed activists) release on Human Rights Day on Thursday," Sukhdev Singh said.The government on Friday asked protesting farmers to be vigilant against their platform being misused, saying some "anti-social" as well as "Leftist and Maoist" elements are conspiring to spoil the atmosphere of the agitation even as the protesters stuck to their demands.

Apart from this, the deities have been given warm clothes and have been covered in a blanket.Earlier, we thought of making a fireplace too but as the makeshift temple is made of wood and glass, it will not be safe.The arrangements made will continue till the winter is here," said the chief priest of the temple, Acharya Satyendra Das.He said since Lord Ram resides here as a child, special care is taken to protect him from the vagaries of the weather."The Lord is bathed in 'itr' (perfume) and the offerings made to him are in keeping with the weather," he said.The priest said the temple already had an air-conditioner installed to keep the deities 'comfortable' in summer.The makeshift temple, situated around a few hundred metres from the Ram Janmabhoomi site, has the deities of Ram Lalla, and his brothers Bharat, Lakshman and Shatrughan along with deity Hanuman and Bhagwan Shaligram, who is represented by an oval black stone.While the four brothers are on one platform, Hanuman and Bhagwan Shaligram are on two separate platforms.Meanwhile, VHP spokesperson Sharad Sharma said this year no permissions were sought from local authorities, unlike last year."Last year we had met the Ayodhya Commissioner back in October and told him that 'Ram Lalla', who is the symbol of our faith, is shivering in the cold and arrangements should be made to keep his room warmer. We had asked permission for a room heater and blankets. We were granted the permission back then," he said.From 1992 to 2019 when the Ayodhya dispute was the court, the Supreme Court had ordered status quo at the site and permission had to be taken for any changes.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ram-lalla-gets-blankets-blowers-as-mercury-dips-in-ayodhya-184130

Thus the interest is likely to be credited by this month only,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/epfo-may-credit-8-5-pc-interest-by-month-end-184007

While the leaders of all 32 unions will sit on fast from 8 am to 5 pm at the Singhu border on Monday, farmers unable to make it to Singhu will protest at the district headquarters.Mere propagandaThe Opposition is running a propaganda. These legislations may cause difficulty for some in the short term but will be beneficial to the farmers in the long run. - NS Tomar, Union Agriculture MinisterListen to farm workersIndia and the US share a rich tradition of democracy and peaceful protests. Farm workers are the backbone of both our nations and must have their voices heard. - Ro Khanna, Indian-American CongmanRead also:Shah is believed to have also discussed the “ground situation in Punjab” in the wake of separatists vandalising the statue of Mahatma Gandhi during a protest by Sikh-Americans in the US and allegations of “Khalistan, ultra-left and pro-left wing extremists” having hijacked the farmers’ movement — the charges that farm unions reject vehemently.Following the meeting with the Home Minister, Som Parkash, an MP from Punjab, said the Centre was willing to hold discussions and had offered to amend the laws, even though these were “correct”, only to resolve the issue. He also claimed several ‘jathebandis’ had accepted the government’s amendment offer during the December 3 meeting. “It seems the matter is out of their (leaders’) hands and wrong elements have entered the movement. They need to shun obstinacy and hold conclusive discussions,” he added. Meanwhile, farmers’ leaders picketing at the Singhu border distanced themselves from VM Singh of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh. The latter had announced on Saturday that the farmers were ready for talks with the Centre. The leaders rejected the charge that the movement had been “hijacked”. Stressing that the demands to roll back the laws and legal guarantee for MSP were not negotiable, they said: “Any attempt to hold parallel negotiations with the government amounts to sabotaging the movement.” Gurnam Singh Charuni claimed that groups that had ended the protest were hand in glove with the government and were “never associated with us.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vigil-raised-as-farmers-step-up-protest-183993

In the end, every country will be a loser to global terrorism. - Venkaiah Naidu, Vice-presidentIndia has been piloting the proposal for adoption of a UN convention against terrorism. Vice-President and Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu, while paying homage to security men who lost their lives in the attack on December 13, 2001, today said, “Countries with narrow geo-political and economic interests should not stall India’s efforts for a UN convention on terrorism. In the end, every country will be a loser to global terrorism.”While many countries support India’s voice in this regard, there are some who are oblivious to the larger threats of terrorism out of narrow geo-political and economic considerations, he said.December 13 was a stark reminder of the menace of terrorism and its professed antagonism to democratic values and economic aspirations, said Naidu, as he led the Parliamentarians in paying the homage.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla released the English and Hindi versions of a book titled ‘The Shaurya Unbound-Tales of Valour of the Central Reserve Police Force’ which includes the story of gallantry of those killed in action fighting against the dastardly attack on the Parliament.The book is co-authored by Ms Nitu and M Dhinakaran, both DIGs in the CRPF. It brings forth details of operations along with valuable insights. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah, Union Minister of Social Justice & Empowerment Thawarchand Gehlot, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, and Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha Harivansh were among others who paid tributes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-stall-un-meet-on-terrorism-naidu-183995
14-12-2020||Rajmeet Singh||No trust in the system, farmers mull their own political outfit||Tribune News ServiceSinghu border, December 13Amid the din of sloganeering and speeches from the rostrum, with speaker after speaker targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allegedly trying to corporatise agriculture, anxiety is palpable among the protesting farmers as they look for a political alternative to safeguard their interests.Do we require “our own” political outfit to stop the exploitation of farmers? If the minimum support price on wheat and rice goes, will the prices of irrigated farmland fall further? Do our farmer leaders have political vision? Such thought-provoking queries trouble the young and the elderly alike as the protesters withdraw to their base camps after the day’s hectic schedule. The questions also reflect their disenchantment with the mainstream political parties — be it the BJP, Shiromani Akali Dal, Congress or the Aam Aadmi Party.With no politician welcome on the “protest stage”, farmer union leaders, including Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan, Jagmohan Singh Dakaunda and Balbir Singh Rajewal, have turned icons at the ‘kisan andolan’here. They have been grabbing space on the social media as well as the digital, print and visual media platforms.As the youth share their concerns with their “new leaders” over the three central farm laws, Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) chief Balbir Singh Rajewal tells them it could be a long haul.The anger and anguish against the political system is writ large on the faces of the protesters. Gurpreet, representing a group of progressive farmers from Ghanaur in Patiala, takes on the powers-that-be over their “double standards”.“We are aware the underground water table is declining sharply due to traditional crops and there is overuse of pesticides, but the successive governments lacked in efforts to wean the farmers away from wheat and paddy. The attempts to promote diversification were half-hearted!” he maintains.“All of them (politicians) stand exposed. The political outfits are concerned only about their own survival amid the changed dynamics,” says Parminder Singh of Chakdana village in Nawanshahr.Otherwise owing allegiance to different political parties, the youngsters at the protest site here no more feel proud of being identified as “Congressi” or “Akali”. “We are farmers and are united here by a common cause,” says Raju from Aulakh village in Gurdaspur.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-trust-in-the-system-farmers-mull-their-own-political-outfit-183996

The SRB is a key indicator of son’s preference vis-à-vis daughters.States with declines in sex ratio at birth among children born in the last five years (between NFHS-4 conducted in 2015-16 and NFHS-5 conducted in 2019-2020) are Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar, Goa, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.The highest decline of 166 points in SRB over five years has been reported by Dadra and Nagar Haveli, where female births per 1,000 male births fell from 983 in 2015-16 to 817 in the latest NFHS round.With a drop of 128 points in SRB over five years (966 in 2015 to 838 in 2020), Goa is the next worst performer, followed by Kerala, which has posted a loss of 96 points – down from 1,047 in 2015 to 951 in 2020.Himachal Pradesh has witnessed a 62 point decline in SRB from 937 in 2005 to 875 in 2020, followed by 26 point decline in Bihar, 20 points in Meghalaya, 11 points in Maharashtra and eight points in Nagaland.What’s worrisome is Kerala was the second best performer on SRB after Punjab in NFHS-4 and had posted a gain of 122 points improving its SRB from 925 in NFHS-3 (2005-2006) to 1,047 in NFHS-4 (2015-2016).Likewise, Meghalaya had gained 102 points in SRB in the last round of NFHS so had Maharashtra which posted a 57 point improvement in female births per 1,000 male births in 2015 as against 2005.Government sources said they were pinning hopes of positive SRB trends on Punjab and Haryana, two of the six best performing states on this indicator in NFHS-4.Punjab and Haryana had led the national SRB gains in the last survey. NFHS-5 data for these two states is yet to be released. While Punjab had improved by 122 points — Punjab’s SRB rose from 734 in NFHS-3 to 860 in NFHS-4 — Haryana improved by 74 points going from 762 in 2005 to 836 in 2015.Top six scorers on SRB in the last round of NFHS were Punjab, Kerala, Meghalaya, Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Three of these six states have squandered past gains.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/worrying-sex-ratio-trend-in-eight-states-184002
14-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||RSS affiliate picks holes in laws, warns against monopoly by MNCs||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 13The economic wing of the RSS, Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), has warned the Narendra Modi government of “monopolistic” situation in Indian markets “where a single party will not only be able to exploit suppliers and farmers, but also consumers”. It suggested changes in FDI rules to block the entry of MNCs in the retail sector.The SJM proposed amendments to the laws to overcome drawbacks and ensure MSP to farmers.A resolution passed at its all-India convention said the intention of the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, is seemingly that farmers get the right price for their produce in the absence of intermediaries.“However, there is a doubt that in absence of ‘mandi fee’, buyers will be naturally encouraged to buy out of the APMC markets. In such a situation it would be appropriate that when laws are being made and purchases are being allowed outside the APMC markets, MSP is guaranteed to the farmer and purchases below the MSP are declared illegal,” it said.The resolution said, “The Bill defines a farmer as a person who engages in the production of farmers’ produce by himself or by a hired labour. This definition of farmer in the Bill is such that companies will also be included in the definition of farmer. Calling this inappropriate, the SJM said, “The definition of farmer should include only the farmer who engages himself in farming, not companies.”On dispute resolution, it said, “The already overburdened Sub-Divisional Magistrate has been placed in key role . Due to this, it would be extremely difficult for the farmers to get justice in the event of a dispute.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-affiliate-picks-holes-in-laws-warns-against-monopoly-by-mncs-184003
