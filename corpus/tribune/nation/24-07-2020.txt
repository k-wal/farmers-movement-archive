24-07-2020||Mumbai||State has no power to cancel exams: UGC to Bombay High Court||The University Grants Commission (UGC) on Friday told the Bombay High Court that the Maharashtra government does not have the power to cancel final year degree examinations amid the COVID-19 pandemic.The affidavit was filed in response to a petition filed by Dhananjay Kulkarni, a retired teacher and former university senate member from Pune, challenging the Maharashtra government’s decision to cancel examinations.The state government canceled final year examinations last month by stating that it has the power to do so under the Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act.But the UGC argued that these acts can not be invoked to “render the statutory provisions of another special Act such as The University Grants Commissioner Act nugatory”.The state government’s decision was contrary to the UGC guidelines issued on April 29 and July 6, 2020, asking all Universities and Institutions to conduct exams by the end of September 2020, the commission added.The guidelines were issued after the Union Ministry of Home Affairs allowed holding of examinations by universities and other institutions, the UGC said.The guidelines were issued to protect the academic and career interests of students and at the same time safeguard their health, it said.The Maharashtra government’s decision “to defer the final year examinations or to graduate students without holding exams would directly affect the standards of higher education in the country,” the UGC said in its affidavit.UGC was the apex body for regulating the standards of examination, the affidavit asserted.“All universities/institutions in the country are obligated to conduct the final year examination by the end of September 2020,” it said.If a student, for unavoidable reason, can not appear for the examination then he or she may be given the opportunity to appear for special examination later, it said.The guidelines provide for several flexible modes of examination including online, offline (pen and paper) and blended (online and offline), the affidavit said.As  per the petition, theUGChad on April 27, 2020 directed all universities to conductexams.However, after a student organisation wrote to the state minister of Higher and Technical Education, theexamsin Maharashtra were postponed and subsequently canceled by the state government, it said.A division bench headed by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta posted the matter for further hearing on July 31.

Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad and Nagpur are important centres of industries in the state. Revival of industries needs to be thought about,” Pawar told reporters here after reviewing the outbreak situation in the district.He said migrant workers, who had returned to their native states during the lockdown, are desirous of coming back to Maharashtra, and how they can return must be given a thought.“There is a need to take care of reviving the state’s economy by resuming industrial activities in full capacity in the time to come. We are trying to understand these issues,” Pawar said.The NCP supremo said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had concentrated for the past few months on tackling the COVID-19 situation.Pawar said Thackeray paid attention to the situation in Mumbai in particular, which he added, was necessary as it is a big city, and noted the situation has improved in the metropolis.However, Thackeray will come to Nashik and also wants to visit other parts of the state, Pawar added.Queried on whether Maharashtra had got benefits from the Centre’s Rs 20 lakh crore economic package to fight the downturn due to the outbreak, Pawar said ventilators and PPE kits had been received by the state to some extent.“But nothing has been added to our knowledge as yet with regard to the package,” Pawar said.He attributed the rise in cases to increase in tests, and added the state health department would increase beds for COVID-19 patients in the days to come.Pawar said minorities cooperated with the authorities during Ramzan Eid amid the lockdown.“Malegaon is a good example of it. Hence, I am sure they will continue to cooperate in the time to come too,” Pawar tweeted later with a hashtag ‘letsfightcoronatogether’.

He also does not have any co-morbid conditions.“The first dose of 0.5 ml intramuscular injection was given to him around 1.30 pm. No immediate side-effects have been observed so far. He was under observation for two hours and will be monitored for the next seven days,” Rai said.Few more participants would be given the vaccine on Saturday after their screening reports come.AIIMS-Delhi is among the 12 sites selected by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) for conducting phase I and II randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of Covaxin.In phase I, the vaccine would be tested on 375 volunteers and the maximum of 100 of them would be from AIIMS.The second phase would include around 750 volunteers from all 12 sites together, Rai said.Phase I of the vaccine trial will be done on healthy people aged 18-55 years having no co-morbid conditions. Women with no pregnancy will also be selected to be a part of the trial in the first phase.In the second phase, 750 people will be recruited between 12-65 years, AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria had said.The phase-I human trials have so far begun in AIIMS Patna and few other sites too.“In the first phase we see the safety of the vaccine which is of primary importance and the dose range is also calculated,” Dr Guleria had said.There are three formulations of the vaccine, and each subject will be given any one of the formulation in two doses two weeks apart.The first 50 will get the lowest strength dose of the vaccine. If it is found to be safe in them, then it will be given to another 50 patients in high doses, according to Rai.COVID-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin, developed by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the ICMR and the National Institute of Virology (NIV), had recently got the nod for human clinical trials from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).

24-07-2020||New Delhi||No reduction but significant increase in width of Ghazipur landfill: AAP rubbishes Gambhir’s claim||A day after BJP MP Gautam Gambhir made a claim about reducing the height of Ghazipur landfill, the AAP said he was “lying” as there was a significant increase in the width of the landfill. The AAP, in a statement, said party MLA from Kolndli Vidhan Sabha Kuldeep Kumar on Friday inspected the Ghazipur landfill site to check the authenticity of the BJP’s claim about reducing the height of the landfill. Gambhir, who is the East Delhi MP, had on Thursday claimed that due the efforts of the East MCD, the height of the landfill had reduced by at least 40 feet in just one year. However, during his visit, Kumar found that Gambhir was “lying”, the statement from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said.“There is no such reduction but a significant increase in the width of the landfill,” the statement said.It further said that only 600 tonnes of garbage is recycled in a single day by the two machines installed there, while 2000 tonnes of garbage is dumped at the site itself.“In the last one year, the width of this landfill has increased and this is why the internal road of the landfill which was just 10 feet in diameter has become 30 feet due to the excessive garbage dumping,” the statement said.Reacting to the AAP’s claim, an aide of Gambhir said the MP had invited Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to visit the landfill site along with him and discuss ways to remove the garbage dump two months ago but did not get a response.“Kejriwal did not respond and now, his legislator has chosen to lie and make nonsense claims,” he said.“Everyday around 3,000 tonnes of garbage is being removed from the Ghazipur landfill. This will be raised to 5000 tonnes per day as four more machines are to be shortly installed there,” he said.

24-07-2020||New Delhi||India’s infection, death rates among lowest: Harsh Vardhan at SCO Health Ministers’ meet||At 864 cases and less than 21 deaths per million population, India has one of the world’s lowest Covid-19 infection and death rate, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday said underlining that the recovery rate among coronavirus-infected patients in the country is 63.45 per cent and the mortality is 2.3 per cent.These remarks were made by Vardhan at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Health Ministers’ Digital Meet held digitally, the Health Ministry said.According to the ministry’s statement, Vardhan emphasised on how the Indian traditional system of medicine has also contributed substantially in boosting the immunity of general population during COVID-19.“There is currently no institutional mechanism within SCO to discuss cooperation in traditional medicine that has the potential to fulfil the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023 and also reinforce the effective implementation of the joint statement on cooperation in combating epidemics signed at the Qingdao Summit in 2018,” the statement quoted him as saying.“This is in spite of such complementary medicine systems being widely practised in all member states of our SCO,” he said and proposed the setting up of a new sub-group on traditional medicine under the existing institutional meetings of the SCO health ministers.Expressing his condolences at the loss of lives across the world due to COVID 19, Vardhan described the India’s political commitment to contain the pandemic and spoke on how Prime Minister Narendra Modi has “personally monitored the situation and ensured a pre-emptive, pro-active and graded response to prevent the deadly virus from spreading”.He explained that a series of actions were initiated in a graded way that included issuing of travel advisories, point-of-entry surveillance, community-based surveillance, enhancement of laboratory and hospital surge capacities, wide dissemination of technical guidelines on managing different aspects of disease outbreak and communicating risk to the public.“The consecutive lockdowns provided India with much required time and opportunity to build up on technical knowhow, laboratory capacities, hospital infrastructure and also to build up its pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions,” Vardhan said.Speaking on the result of the lockdown he said, “India has so far reported 1.25 million cases and more than 30,000 deaths due to COVID-19. At 864 cases per million and less than 21 deaths per million of our population, India has one of the world’s lowest infection and death rates.“Our recovery rate stands at 63.45 per cent, whereas our mortality at 2.3 per cent.”The Union Health Minister also spoke on the increase in testing capacity and health infrastructure during the lockdown and after, the statement said.On logistics, Vardhan said, “India didn’t have a single manufacturer of personal protective equipment (PPE) and now the country has developed indigenous capacity in the past few months to the extent that the country can export quality PPEs.“Similar scaling up was also done for achieving other indigenous capacity and reducing the demand & supply gap for ventilators and medical oxygen.”He also elaborated on the innovative use of information technology in virtually every aspect of COVID management.“Aarogya Setu app and ITIHAS, a cellular-based tracking technology, are used for surveillance and identification of potential clusters of disease, RT-PCR app for testing, facility app for managing information on admitted patients and hospital bed capacities, all integrated with a single COVID portal.”According to the statement, Vardhan called upon all member nations to rise in this time of crisis and mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on health and economy.He also congratulated all the frontline staff dealing with the pandemics and called them “no less than God for humanity”.

24-07-2020||Jaipur||Congress to hold protests across Rajasthan against BJP on Saturday||The Congress in Rajasthan will hold demonstrations in all district headquarters on Saturday against the BJP’s “conspiracy” to bring down the Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot-led government, the party said.It also claimed “invisible powers” in Delhi are trying to ensure that the Governor does not convene a session of the state Assembly.Gehlot has accused the BJP of trying to topple his government by indulging in horse-trading. He has also accused his former deputy Sachin Pilot, who he is locked in a power tussle with, of colluding with the BJP to make his own party sink.“Congress workers will hold demonstrations in all district headquarters tomorrow at 11 am against the BJP’s conspiracy to murder democracy,” PCC president Govind Singh Dotasra said on Friday.If needed, our workers will also hold demonstrations at panchayat level, he told reporters outside the Raj Bhawan, where Congress MLAs are sitting on a dharna demanding that the governor summons a session of the state Assembly.“The BJP is conspiring to topple our government and the public is watching this. Efforts are also being made by invisible powers sitting in Delhi to influence the governor. People want the elected government to complete its tenure,” he added.Dotasra also accused the BJP of trying to ensure that the Assembly session is not convened.“The Cabinet passed a proposal and sent it to the Governor for calling the Assembly session and for proving the majority... so that those who have been ‘abducted’ (dissident MLAs) can come and the confusion ends but attempts are being made to hijack this too,” he said.In an indication that the Congress government is preparing for a floor test in the Assembly, Gehlot met the Governor on Thursday and is said to have discussed calling a session of the House.However, earlier on Friday, the Chief Minister claimed the Governor was under pressure from “above” not to call an Assembly session.Earlier this week, Gehlot wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, other BJP leaders and some “overambitious leaders” of his own party of being involved in the alleged attempt to topple the Congress Government in Rajasthan.The BJP, however, has rejected the Congress’s allegations saying whatever is going on is the result of infighting between Gehlot and Pilot.

24-07-2020||New Delhi||Rajasthan Governor bound by cabinet’s advice, say legal experts||Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra has no option but to accept the recommendation of the Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot Cabinet to convene the Assembly session, legal experts said on Friday.Referring to Constitution schemes on power and duties of Governor, they were of the common view that the Governor is duty-bound by the advice of the Cabinet.Amid high political drama unfolding in the state, Gehlot accused Mishra on Friday of being under pressure not to call the Assembly session.Also read: Congress MLAs stage dharna at Raj Bhawan, demand Assembly sessionGehlot, whose government is facing a challenge from 19 rebel Congress MLAs, including his sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, said the state government requested the Governor to call the session but he had not yet issued the order.Referring to the five-judge Constitution Bench judgement in Nabam Rebia (Arunachal Pradesh) case, senior advocates Rakesh Dwivedi and Vikas Singh said the Supreme Court has clearly stated that Governor is bound by the advice of the Cabinet and he has to convene the Assembly.Dwivedi said the Governor had no discretion and at best he could confer with the Chief Minister for change of date to hold the session.Another senior lawyer, who refused to be named, said once the Cabinet sends a recommendation, the Governor was bound to convene a meeting of the Assembly for the floor test.Talking to PTI, Singh said: “In Nabam Rebia matter, the Supreme Court has clearly said Governor is bound by the advice of the Cabinet. He can’t say no and he has to call the house whenever the Chief Minister asks him to do so.”The senior lawyer said it was for the Chief Minister to see whether there is a threat of COVID-19 or not.“It is not for the Governor. He can direct people to follow rules and do social distancing. But he cannot refuse the Chief Minister,” Singh said.Referring to Article 163(1) of the Constitution, the Apex Court in its judgement had said the Governor was bound by the advice of his Council of Ministers.“Governor is only a formal or constitutional head. His executive functions are, therefore, dependent on the aid and advice given by the Council of Ministers. Since there is no provision enabling the Governor to act in ‘his individual judgment’ the Governor is bound by the advice of the Council of Ministers with whose aid he acts,” the top court had said.The Rajasthan High Court on Friday morning ordered maintaining status quo on disqualification notices issued by Assembly Speaker C P Joshi to the 19 dissident Congress MLAs, including Sachin Pilot.The notices were served by the Assembly speaker to the MLAs on July 14 after the party complained to him that the legislators had defied a whip to attend two Congress Legislature Party meetings last week.Rajasthan Congress MLAs in the Ashok Gehlot camp have begun a ‘dharna’ at the Raj Bhawan, saying they will stay put till the Governor summons the session of the state Assembly.

Since it was impossible to make ends meet in a large family that includes several small children, I decided to display my stick-fighting skill on the roads so that patrons would give money," she said.A family member said the video had helped them garner help in form of kind and cash.

The matter will be heard in due course now," said a counsel for the Speaker.The Bench, in its order, said the writ petition was maintainable and was admitted on the ground of three pleas of the petitioners."After completion of filing of pleadings of the parties and the intervenors, counsel for the parties shall be at liberty to file an application for early hearing of the writ petition. Till then, the ‘status quo’, as exists today viz-a-viz impugned notices dated 14.07.2020, shall be maintained," stated the order.Also read: Cong MLAs stage dharna at Raj Bhawan, demand Assembly sessionPrior to this, the court allowed an application for impleadment of the Union of India in the list of respondents.The court also rejected two pleas which sought an order declaring that alleged actions of the petitioners as the members of Rajasthan Legislative Assembly do not come within the purview of disqualification envisaged under Para (2) of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, and declaring Clause 2 (1) (a) of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution ultra vires.Rejecting the petitions, the court said they are beyond its jurisdiction.The Congress had sought action against Pilot and the other dissidents under paragraph 2 (1) (a) of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution.The provision disqualifies MLAs if they "voluntarily" give up the membership of the party which they represent in the House.The Pilot camp, however, argued that a party whip applies only when the Assembly was in session.The disqualification notice was challenged by the dissident MLAs through the writ petition which was taken up by the bench on last Friday and arguments were held.The arguments continued on Monday and concluded on Tuesday. The court had on Tuesday said it would give appropriate order on the writ petition on Friday.Meanwhile, the Assembly Speaker moved the Supreme Court and filed a special leave petition (SLP) on Wednesday.Pilot was sacked as the Deputy Chief Minister and the president of the Congress state unit after he rebelled against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.

Indore veggie vendor Raisa Ansari speaking fluent English to protest over the 'left-right' shop opening scheme of IMC. She also claimed to be a Masters in Physics from DAVV in 2011. pic.twitter.com/vSYQqpo6ID“I always wanted to become a scientist. But because of some family problems, I had to step into my family’s business of selling vegetables and fruits,” Ansari told PTI.The coronavirus-induced lockdown had severely hit her family and when the curbs were relaxed, Ansari resumed the business.However, the IMC’s order, asking roadside vendors to avoid crowding at market places and keep their pushcarts moving as they sell their wares, spelled doom for many.When the civic authorities moved to remove the carts of errant vendors, Ansari’s anguish poured out.Terming the attitude of IMC officials as “insensitive”, she said, “Civic officials consider themselves kings and think we, petty businessmen, are worse than beggars.”Following the public outrage over the drive against roadside vendors, the IMC has suspended the move until further orders.With 6,457 COVID-19 cases recorded so far, Indore is among the worst affected districts in the state.

24-07-2020||New Delhi||India’s Covid-19 case fatality rate drops to 2.38 per cent; recovery rate rises to 63.34 per cent||For the third day in a row, the number of COVID-19 recoveries in a 24-hour span saw another record high, with 34,602 patients having recuperated pushing the recovery rate to 63.45 per cent, the Union Health Ministry said on Friday.The case fatality rate has further declined to 2.38 per cent, it said.According to data updated at 8 am, the total recoveries have climbed to 8,17,208, while there are 4,40,135 active cases of coronavirus in the country at present, the ministry said as the COVID-19 tally surged to 12.87 lakh.India also saw a record single-day spike of 49,310 cases while the death-toll mounted to 30,601 with 740 new fatalities, the data said.The ministry said as a result of constantly growing number of recoveries, the recovered patients outnumber the active cases by 3,77,073. “This difference is showing a progressively growing upward trend.”   Further, a cumulative total of 1,54,28,170 samples have been tested for COVID-19 up to July 23. On Thursday,  3,52,801 samples were tested.  “This translates to 11179.83 tests per million (TPM) for India, which has seen a steady increase since the adoption of the ‘test, track and treat’ strategy,” the ministry said.The rise in TPM has been achieved with a steady rise in the number of labs (1290 so far), and efforts by the Centre and state governments and union territorty administrations to facilitate wide-spread testing through an array of options, it noted.There are currently 897 labs in the government sector and 393 private labs.As for the country registering increasing number of recoveries, the ministry said that efforts of states and union territories are bolstered by the central teams of experts sent to high case-load areas and through strategic discussions held by Central government through video conferencing with state and district officials.“With the dedicated efforts of healthcare workers, the recoveries are improving and case fatality is continuously falling, which currently stands at 2.38 per cent,” the ministry said.The sustained rise in number of recoveries is the result of a well formulated and executed strategy of containment of COVID-19 by the state and union territory governments under the guidance of the Union government.It primarily focuses on early detection through aggressive testing along with house-to-house surveys, contact tracing and surveillance of SARI/ILI cases to actively search for cases in the highly vulnerable categories. This is followed by effective containment plans and efficient clinical management through the ramped up three-tier health infrastructure and well executed standard of care protocol.These have successfully aided in effective treatment in the hospitals and through home isolation which in turn has ensured that the hospitals remain unburdened for critical patients, the ministry said.

24-07-2020||Mumbai||Most people in India not comfortable travelling for at least a year: Survey||Even as several states have opened their doors for tourists, a survey has showed that most people are not comfortable travelling for at least a year due to the coronavirus pandemic.The states that have opened their borders for the visitors include Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Goa, and Madhya Pradesh, according to the survey by Neta App.The technology platform mainly aims to foster political accountability by enabling citizens to signal a change in their political preferences at any point in time.Over 54,000 people participated in the survey across 19 states and Delhi-NCR, which was conducted between July 16 and 20.However, it found that 71 per cent of the people surveyed said they are not comfortable travelling for at least a year, while 25 per cent felt they might only consider travelling after six months from now.“While the tourism industry has started to make a comeback in a big way in Europe; in India, the current signals are bleak,” Neta App founder Pratham Mittal said.He added that with daily cases of coronavirus infections still rising in many states, Indian tourists would rather spend time at home than travel and put their life in danger.“We may see this change in the next six months though as indicated by the survey.” Further, the survey showed that while the state governments have announced a slew of measures to ensure safety for travellers, 68 per cent of the respondents said they are not satisfied with the precautions being taken by the governments.The findings also pointed out that 54 per cent respondents are more comfortable staying at hotel rather than home stay (11 per cent) or with friends or family (35 per cent) fearing cross contamination due to close interactions with people.People are more comfortable travelling to locations nearer to them, the survey further indicated.For instance, majority of Delhiites are comfortable travelling to HP, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan as opposed to other states like Goa or Madhya Pradesh, it said.Similarly, people from Maharashtra and Karnataka are comfortable travelling to Goa considering the proximity, it added.

24-07-2020||Aditi Tandon||This day in 1991, I presented the bold budget: Manmohan Singh remembers Narasimha Rao on his centenary birth celebrations||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 24Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Friday inaugurated the birth centenary celebrations of late prime minister PV Narasimha Rao, remembering how this very day 29 years ago he presented the historic union budget that ushered economic liberalisation in India.Narasimha Rao was born on June 28, 1921.Manmohan Singh described Rao as an important member of the Congress, who worked closely with late prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, and later led the party to a 244-seat lead in the 1991 Lok Sabha elections that were held after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.Speaking at the first formal event the Congress ever organised in the memory of Rao, Manmohan Singh said: “I am particularly happy that this programme has been organised on the day I had the privilege, as the Finance Minister of India, for presenting the first budget of Narasimha Rao Ji’s government in 1991.”Manmohan Singh hailed Rao for his bold leadership and ability to carry everyone along as he said: “It was a budget that ushered in economic reforms and liberalisation. It was a hard choice and a bold decision and it was possible because Prime Minister Narasimha Rao Ji gave me the freedom to roll out things, after he fully understood what was ailing India’s economy at that time.”Often in his speech, Manmohan Singh spoke of late Rajiv Gandhi and Narasimha Rao in the same breath as here when he said: “Like Rajiv Ji, Narasimha Rao Ji, too, had great concern for the poor and had told the then Managing Director of the IMF, Mr Michel Camdessus, that reforms in India would have to be mindful of Indian concerns. Economic Reforms were preceded by a push in that direction when Rajiv Gandhi was the Prime Minister.”What Manmohan Singh stressed though was that the 1991 budget was politically a big question.“The question was if one could take hard decisions to meet the challenging situation. It was a precariously placed minority Government, dependent on outside support.  Yet Narasimha Rao Ji was able to carry everyone along, convincing them with his conviction. Enjoying his confidence, I went about my job to carry forward his vision,” said Singh calling Rao thefather of Economic Reforms in India.Mindful of the troubled relationship between the Congress under Sonia Gandhi and Rao (whose body was not allowed to be brought to AICC headquarters for last respects when he died) Singh today spoke of the late PM as being “an important member of the Congress party, working very closely with Indira Ji and Rajiv Ji”.Manmohan Singh said Rao was chosen to be the Congress president after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, halfway through the 1991 Lok Sabha election.“The party ended up winning 244 Lok Sabha seats. Though Narasimha Rao Ji himself did not contest the elections but had been the Congress President, he became the automatic choice to become the Prime Minister of India on June 21, 1991. It was on this day that he made me his Finance Minister,” recalled former PM Manmohan Singh.Hailing equally Rao’s contributions to “Look East Policy” and the Indian Space programme, Singh spoke also of how his late guide “always tried to take the opposition into confidence”.Here, Manmohan Singh cited Rao deputing Atal Bihar Vajpayee Ji as the leader of the Indian delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva to discuss Pakistan-sponsored resolution to censure India on its record of human rights in Jammu & Kashmir.“The resolution was successfully thwarted. Rao ji also nominated Subramaniam Swamy as Chairman of the Commission on Labour Standards and International Trade, with a Cabinet-rank,” Manmohan Singh mentioned in his speech at the virtual event.Earlier, Congress president Sonia Gandhi also sent a message in the memory of Rao calling him “scholarly, erudite and bold” and speaking of how the Congress takes “pride in his many achievements”.Rahul Gandhi’s message also hailed Rao for his contributions to economic reforms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/this-day-in-1991-i-presented-the-bold-budget-manmohan-singh-remembers-narasimha-rao-on-his-centenary-birth-celebrations-117409
24-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi resident first to get dose of indigenously-developed potential COVID-19 vaccine||The phase-I human clinical trial of India’s first indigenously-developed vaccine against novel coronavirus, Covaxin, began at the AIIMS here on Friday with the first dose of the injection given to a man in his 30s.Already, over 3,500 volunteers have registered themselves for the trial at AIIMS since last Saturday, of whom the screening of at least 22 people is underway, said Dr Sanjay Rai, Professor at the Centre for Community Medicine at AIIMS and the principal investigator of the study.“The first volunteer, a resident of Delhi, was screened two days ago and all his health parameters were found to be within the normal range. He also does not have any co-morbid conditions.”“The first dose of 0.5 ml intramuscular injection was given to him around 1.30 pm. No immediate side-effects have been observed so far. He was under observation for two hours and will be monitored for the next seven days,” Rai said.Few more participants would be given the vaccine on Saturday after their screening reports come.AIIMS-Delhi is among the 12 sites selected by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) for conducting phase I and II randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of Covaxin.In phase I, the vaccine would be tested on 375 volunteers and the maximum of 100 of them would be from AIIMS.         The second phase would include around 750 volunteers from all 12 sites together, Rai said.Phase I of the vaccine trial will be done on healthy people aged 18-55 years having no co-morbid conditions. Women with no pregnancy will also be selected to be a part of the trial in the first phase.In the second phase, 750 people will be recruited between 12-65 years, AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria had said.Already, around 1,800 volunteers have registered themselves for the trial at AIIMS, he had said.“In the first phase we see the safety of the vaccine which is of primary importance and the dose range is also calculated,” he said.There are three formulations of the vaccine, and each subject will be given any one of the formulation in two doses two weeks apart.The first 50 will get the lowest strength dose of the vaccine. If it is found to be safe in them, then it will be given to another 50 patients in high doses, acording to Rai.COVID-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin, developed by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the ICMR and the National Institute of Virology (NIV), had recently got the nod for human clinical trials from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).

It claimed that despite a letter from the Rajasthan DGP, they did not receive any assistance from the police of the two states.The notices have been served on ITC Grand Bharat, Tauru, and Best Western Country Inn, Manesar, asking the resorts to not just submit the CCTV footage but also the booking records in case any room had been booked in the name of suspended Congress MLA Bhanwar Lal Sharma.In case there were any bookings in Sharma’s name, then the resorts have been told to provide details, including of check-in, check-out, parking, identity proof, payments, etc.According to Ashok Rathore, ADG (SOG and ATS), they had ample evidence that Sharma was staying at the Manesar resort.“We have credible inputs that the MLA was residing in one of the two private resorts. Hence, we have asked the hotel administrations to provide us the necessary details at the earliest,” he said.A senior SOG member said they had sufficient proof of Sharma staying in Country Inn and switching to Bharat for a few hours, but they had been kept at bay from approaching him by the local police and resort authorities.The Rajasthan police had pressed into service three agencies for tracing the MLAs, especially Sharma, whose name had allegedly figured in FIRs lodged over horse-trading to topple the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan.The FIRs relate to two audio clips in which Sharma is purportedly heard allegedly discussing bribe to switch support.  It was last Friday that the SOG had come to Manesar to seek audio samples of Sharma but was stopped by the Haryana Police. After a showdown of almost an hour, the team was allowed inside ITC Grand Bharat but found no one there and returned empty-handed. It accused the local police of intentionally holding them up to help Sharma escape. A similar raid was conducted on July 19 at Country Inn, but the SOG team was not allowed inside.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-15-unsuccessful-raids-rajasthan-cops-seek-cctv-footage-from-2-haryana-resorts-housing-rebel-congress-mlas-117404

It had also asked the committee to put its decisions in the public domain.A Bench led by Justice NV Ramana had asked the Centre and J&K Administration to respond to the contempt plea by NGO Foundation for Media Professionals, which alleged that despite the top court’s order, the said committee to assess the need for internet restrictions in J&K had not been formed. The NGO wanted restoration of 4G internet services to enable children to attend their schools online.However, terming the NGO’s allegation as “totally misconceived and misconstrued”, the MHA affidavit said the special committee was constituted by the Supreme Court itself on May 11, 2020, when the Justice NV Ramana-led bench had ordered that a special committee headed by Home Secretary, Government of India, would be formed to review the internet restrictions in the valley.“After the May 11 order of the Supreme Court, no further notification or order from the government was needed,” the affidavit stated.During the previous hearing, Attorney General KK Venugopal had contested the allegations, saying there was no question of contempt as the said committee had already been constituted.  “How can there be contempt if the committee has already been put in place?” he had wondered.While refusing to order the restoration of 4G mobile internet services in Jammu and Kashmir, a three-judge Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana had on May 11 set up a special committee led by Union Home Secretary to take a call on the issue after factoring in the security situation on the ground. Besides the Union Home Secretary, DoT Secretary and Chief Secretary of J-K was to be on the panel.In its May 11 order, the Supreme Court said: “...since the issues involved affect the state and the nation, the Review Committee (under Telecom Rules), which consists of only state-level officers, may not be in a position to satisfactorily address all issues raised.”“We do recognise that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir has been plagued with militancy, which is required to be taken into consideration. These competing considerations need to be calibrated in terms of our judgment (on lockdown in J&K) in Anuradha Bhasin (case),” it had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-immediate-resumption-of-4g-internet-services-in-jk-mha-tells-sc-117400

But I do take the utmost precautions, which is multi-layered because I too have a family,” Azmat said.About coronavirus, he said almost 90 per cent of those who died due to the pandemic and those he had buried were those who had never ventured out of their houses.“If you have to get the disease, you will certainly get it even if you have caged yourself in the house. I have seen young people in their twenties without any comorbidities dying of coronavirus and also seen elderly people with comorbidities escaping from it. It's a very tricky disease,” Azmat added.

24-07-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Muted response to plasma donation call, doctors say unfounded fears keeping people away||The response to a call for donating convalescent plasma for COVID-19 patients in Delhi has been "lukewarm", doctors said on Friday and attributed it to unfounded apprehensions about associated health risks and the tendency to put off donation for any future need of family members.Just about 320 people have donated plasma in Delhi since the initiative began on July 2, whereas more than 1,00,000 COVID-19 patients have recovered till July 23, according to officials.  Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the government would provide plasma for free and people do not need to buy or sell it. The chief minister and other senior members of the government have repeatedly appealed to people, who have recovered from COVID-19, to donate plasma to other patients. But the response to the calls has been muted at the first-of-its-kind 'plasma bank', inaugurated by Kejriwal at ILBS here on July 2, and another one opened a week ago at LNJP Hospital, a dedicated coronavirus facility."At ILBS, while on the opening day, 10 donors had come, mostly the hospital staff who had earlier been infected with COVID-19, now the daily average is about 15, which makes it around 300 donations in total till date, a rather lukewarm response," a senior official of the facility told PTI.This is despite the fact that to-and-fro transportation facilities and food are provided to the donors at the Institute of Liver and Biliary Science (ILBS)."The main reason behind this low response...is that people are still feeling apprehensive even though there is no risk involved," the official, also a doctor, said. At LNJP Hospital's plasma bank, 30 donors have volunteered till July 23, but 11 were rejected, as they could not fulfil the eligibility guidelines."So, effectively, we are left with 19 donations which is not a very encouraging number, and some of which have been used already. But it is heartening that young people, mostly in the age group of 20-40, are donating their plasma," Medical Director, LNJP Hospital, Dr Suresh Kumar, told PTI.He said, once two young sisters in their 20s, both of whom had been admitted at LNJP Hospital and recovered from COVID-19, had come to donate plasma, but their haemoglobin level was found below average limit, so they could not.Both ILBS and LNJP Hospital are under the Delhi government.Asked why such a low response despite the chief minister and his colleagues urging people to donate plasma, Kumar said there seem to be multiple factors."Though there are no side effects as such, but still many have apprehensions that something will happen if they donate plasma. Secondly, many COVID patients who have recovered, are apparently putting off donation so that they can offer it to their family members, in case they get infected, and the fear of near and dear ones getting infected is very palpable," he said.A staffer at the LNJP plasma bank, on the condition of anonymity, said that mostly LNJP Hospital staff members who had recovered from COVID-19 were coming to donate plasma in earlier days.At present, out of the 430 admitted patients there, 90 are in ICU and four on ventilator, the medical director said.As per the last approval by authorities, the LNJP Hospital was permitted to do plasma therapy on 200 COVID-19 patients. "Only 60 patients have received plasma out of the allotted lot," he said.Kumar and the ILBS official appealed to people to come forward and donate, and allayed all apprehensions associated with convalescent plasma (COPLA) donation.For donors, there are some strict criteria and counselling and screening is done for them before actual donation process begins, so, about two to two-and-a-half hours is the total time per donor."Also, we do TTI (Transfusion Transmissible Infections) tests. So, the donor should not have HIV, hepatitis B or C, syphilis among other ailments. The donor also should not have any co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension or renal problems," a senior doctor at the ILBS said.Each donor, a person who has recently recovered from COVID-19, develops antibodies, which is transferred to the recipient through plasma."Each person can donate 250-500 ml of plasma. We give first dosage of 250 ml to the recipient, and if needed second dosage of 250 ml after 24 hours," Kumar said.People aged 18-60, who have fully recovered from COVID-19 and showed no symptoms for 14 days can go for donation, subject to strict guidelines for eligible donors.And, someone weighing less than 50 kg; women who have ever been pregnant, cancer survivors, and those with kidney, heart, lung or liver diseases are not eligible to donate plasma.Delhi recorded 1041 fresh coronavirus cases on Thursday, taking the tally in the city to over 1.27 lakh, while the death toll from the disease rose to 3,745, authorities said.The active cases tally on Thursday was 14,554, down from 14,954 the previous day. According to a bulletin, 1,09,065 patients have recovered, been discharged or migrated till July 23.Kumar said that when he takes a round in wards and ICU, "some patients, who are serious, and their relatives, ask us as to when will be they be getting plasma." "People must show large-heartedness and help others," he added.

Their son, Ananda Shankar, who is an acclaimed music composer, died in 1999. He was 57 while their daughter, Mamata Shankar, who is 65-years-old, is an actress-turned-dancer and choreographer.Mamata Shankar debuted opposite Mithun Chakraborty in Mrinal Sen’s Hindi film “Mrigaya”. She has primarily acted in Bengali movies.Uday Shankar, who was the elder brother of the late sitar maestro Pandit Ravi Shankar, married Amala Shankar in 1942.She was then a member of her dance troupe.The marriage failed to endure the test of time.Uday Shankar spent the final years of his life with Anupama Das. She was a student at the dance school that Uday and Amala Shabnkar ran in Kolkata.At 76, Uday Shankar died in 1977. Later, it was found that he gifted his theatrical costumes and other dancing paraphernalia to Das.The rights of the Uday Shankar and Amala Shabkar feature film “Kalpana”, made by Uday Shankar, was also given away to Anupama by the Padma Vibhushan awardee.The deed gifting the items to Anupama did not show Uday Shankar’s immediate family members in a favourable light.It mentioned that the donor was having strained feelings and relations with his family members including his wife, son and daughter and alleged that they abandoned him.In a condolence message Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee mourned Amala Shankar’s death.“Her death has caused an irreparable loss to the word of dancing”, stated the message from Banerjee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/noted-dancer-choreographer-amala-shankar-passes-away-117372
24-07-2020||Kolkata||"Overambitious" young leaders quitting Cong as they feel party won't come to power soon: Adhir||Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury feels a section of young "overambitious" leaders is becoming increasingly restless and deserting the party due to the growing perception that it is not going to return to power at the Centre anytime soon.Conceding that their exit might adversely impact the party "temporarily", the veteran Congress MP, however, said party "discipline and ideology can't be compromised to satisfy the individual aspirations of leaders who lack ideological commitment.The Congress leader hinted at the possibility of some more young leaders quitting the party after the high-profile desertion of Jyotiraditya Scindia and rebellion by Sachin Pilot."There is a certain section of overambitious young leaders.....they are becoming restless and feeling they are not getting their due in the party and are looking for other options to satisfy their individual ambitions."This is happening due to a growing perception that as the Congress wont return to power (at the Centre) shortly, so the party wont be able to satisfy all their demands. So they are either jumping the ship or are planning to do so, Chowdhury told PTI in an interview.Talking about Scindia and Pilot, he said they were never neglected or given short shrift by the party.He said there have been leaders with great potential in several political parties who did not get their due. "But did they leave their party to enjoy the fruits of power? The answer is no. The problem is the lack of commitment," he said.Chowdhury also rejected the claim that Jyotiraditya Scindia won Madhya Pradesh for the Congress as its campaign committee chief for the assembly polls.If that were the case, he would not have lost his Lok Sabha seat, the veteran Congress leader said.Rajasthan, where Sachin Pilot has risen in revolt against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, has a history of change of guard every five years, Chowdhury said."Had he (Pilot) been the only factor which led to our victory in the 2018 assembly polls we wouldnt have fared so badly in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Rajasthan, he said.Scindia left the Congress with his band of loyal MLAs in March and joined the BJP, resulting in the fall of the Kamal Nath government and the saffron party's return to power.Pilot was removed as deputy chief minister and Rajasthan Congress president after he revolted against Gehlot, a representative of the old guard in the Congress.He has neither left the party nor been expelled.Former union minister Milind Deora, one of the young faces in the Congress had last year proposed Pilot and Scindia for the post of the party's national president.Deora had told PTI he agreed with Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh that the new Congress president should be young, capable and possess electoral, administrative and organisational experience, and a pan-India appeal."In my view, Sachin Pilot and Jyotiraditya Scindia have all these qualities and can provide strength to the organisation and vigour to the opposition space," he had said.When asked whether the disillusionment of the young leaders stems from the power struggle between the old guard and the Young Turks in the party, with the former holding sway, Chowdhury replied in the negative.Can you show me one political party in India which has leaders of only one age group? Any political party or organisation is a blend of young and experienced leaders. Just because I am over 60 will you throw me out of the party? In BJP, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L K Advani were leaders, they had groomed others like Narendra Modi and the present-day BJP leadership, he said.Chowdhury blamed a section of media for presenting the difference of opinion as disputes within the party.He dismissed as "untrue" suggestions that Scindia and Pilot were sidelined as they could pose a threat to Rahul Gandhi's leadership."This is completely untrue. Had Rahul Ji felt threatened by them, he wont have encouraged them to take up important assignments both in the party and in governments, he said.When asked whether the problems the Congress is facing stemmed from a leadership crisis, the five-time MP from West Bengals Beharampore said the party is just going through a bad, rough patch, which is quite common in politics.There is no leadership crisis in our party. Its a media creation. We have Sonia Gandhi as our leader and no one should question her political acumen as it under her leadership that the party won two successive terms from 2004- 2014, he said.Responding to a question about who will take over the mantle from interim president Sonia Gandhi, Chowdhury, a member of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the highest decision-making body of the party, said though there were several good leaders they lack the stature and charisma of the Gandhi family which acts as glue for the party."We would like to have a member of the Gandhi family to lead us. Sonia Gandhiji has done a great job in the last year. If Rahul Gandhi Ji wants to take up the mantle he can always do so, he said.Asked why the Congress was reluctant about looking beyond the Gandhi family despite repeated electoral reverses, he said, "Thats because no one has the charisma the Gandhi family has. When we have someone else with such charisma, he can lead the party. We had P V Narasimha Rao, Sitaram Kesari as party presidents in the past.He said a "false" perception has been created by a section of media at BJP's bidding that Rahul Gandhi is a "part-time politician".Chowdhury said Rahul Gandhi is the only leader who has been consistently opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government's policies."He has been uncompromising in it. But a section of media loves to paint him as an immature politician. The day we return to power, you will find Rahul ji being hailed as a great politician," he said.

New Delhi said it reserves its position in the matter, including its rights to avail of further remedies.Responding to questions on recent developments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the entire exercise on part of Pakistan not to provide relevant documents even after repeated requests, deny unimpeded consular access and take reported unilateral action of approaching the high court exposed the “farcical nature” of its approach.Over the past one year, he said, India had sought consular access 12 times but Pakistan had not done so. On July 16, the meeting of consular officers with Jadhav was scuttled and the team was instructed not to hand over any documents to him.Citing infirmities in the legal process, he said Pakistan took two weeks to inform India about the ordinance and shared a copy only after New Delhi’s request. “It seems Pakistan was non-serious in its approach.... It has blocked all avenues for an effective remedy available for India,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mea-reserve-right-to-remedy-on-jadhav-117192
