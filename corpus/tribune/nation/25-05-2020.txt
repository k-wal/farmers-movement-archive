25-05-2020||New Delhi||Concerns over safety: WHO suspends HCQ arm of solidarity drug trial||The WHO Executive Group on Monday temporarily suspended the hydroxychloroquine arm within the ongoing Solidarity Trial while the data is reviewed by its Data Safety Monitoring Board.The trial is being undertaken by ten nations, including India, and is testing four drugs and combinations against COVID-19.Of these four drugs, HCQ drug trial has been suspended, said WHO after The Lancet last Friday published a study that revealed greater risk of death among COVID patients who were administered the anti malarial HCQ.“The other arms of the trial are continuing. The HCQ concern relates to the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloraquine in COVID-19. These drugs are accepted as generally safe for use in patients with autoimmune diseases or malaria. But in COVID patients they have showed adverse effects,” WHO said today.The world body added that the review of HCQ efficacy will consider data collected so far in the Solidarity Trial and, in particular robust randomised available data, to adequately evaluate the potential benefits and harms from this drug.WHO cited the Lancet observational study on hydroxycholoroquine and chloraquine and its effects on COVID-19 patients that have been hospitalised to say, “The authors reported that among COVID-19 patients receiving the drug, when used alone or with a macrolide, they estimated a higher mortality rate.”The suspension of HCQ trial by WHO comes close on the heels of Indian ICMR expanding its use as a preventive drug in asymptotic health workers across all hospitals and in asymptotic COVID warriors in containment zones.Over 400 hospitals in 35 countries are actively recruiting patients and nearly 3,500 patients have been enrolled from 17 countries for the WHO Solidarity Trial.The remaining three drugs under the trial will continue to be tested.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/concerns-over-safety-who-suspends-hcq-arm-of-solidarity-drug-trial-89843
25-05-2020||New Delhi||Indian, Chinese armies appear heading towards biggest face-off after Doklam||Indian and Chinese troops remained engaged in an eyeball-to-eyeball situation in several disputed areas along the Line of Actual Control in Eastern Ladakh, signalling that the confrontation could become the biggest military face-off after the Doklam episode in 2017.Top military sources said India has further increased its strength in Pangong Tso and Galwan Valley—the two contentious areas where the Chinese Army is learnt to have been deploying around 2,000 to 2,500 troops, besides gradually enhancing temporary infrastructure.“The strength of the Indian Army in the area is much better than our adversary,” said a top military official on the condition of anonymity.The biggest concern for the Indian military has been the presence of Chinese troops around several key points, including Indian Post KM120 along the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in the Galwan valley.“It is serious. It is not a normal kind of transgression,” former Northern Army Commander Lt Gen (Retd) DS Hooda told PTI.He particularly emphasised that Chinese transgression into areas like Galwan was worrying as there was no dispute between the two sides in the area.Strategic Affairs expert Ambassador Ashok K Kantha too agreed with Lt Gen Hooda.“There have been multiple incursions (by Chinese troops). This is something which causes concern. It is not a routine standoff. This is a disturbing situation,” Kantha said.Sources said diplomatic efforts must be ramped up to resolve the escalating tension between the two armies and that both sides are eyeball-to-eyeball in several areas including Pangong Tso, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie.The Chinese side has particularly strengthened its presence in the Galwan Valley, erecting around 100 tents in the last two weeks and bringing in heavy equipment for construction of bunkers.The sources said Indian troops are resorting to “aggressive patrolling” in several sensitive areas including Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldi.The situation in Eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on the evening of May 5 which spilled over to the next day before the two sides agreed to “disengage” following a meeting at the level of local commanders.Over 100 Indian and Chinese soldiers were injured in the violence.The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in North Sikkim on May 9.India last week said the Chinese military was hindering normal patrolling by its troops and asserted that India has always taken a very responsible approach towards border management.At a media briefing, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava also strongly refuted China’s contention that the tension was triggered due to trespassing by Indian forces on the Chinese side.India’s response came two days after China accused the Indian Army of trespassing into its territory, claiming that it was an “attempt to unilaterally change the status” of the LAC in Sikkim and Ladakh.On May 5, the Indian and Chinese army personnel clashed with iron rods, sticks, and even resorted to stone-pelting in the Pangong Tso lake area in which soldiers on both sides sustained injuries.In a separate incident, nearly 150 Indian and Chinese military personnel were engaged in a face-off near Naku La Pass in the Sikkim sector on May 9. At least 10 soldiers from both sides sustained injuries.The troops of India and China were engaged in a 73-day stand-off in Doklam tri-junction in 2017 which even triggered fears of a war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas.China has been critical of India’s reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir, and has particularly criticised New Delhi for making Ladakh a union territory. China lays claim over several parts of Ladakh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first informal summit in April 2018 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, months after the Doklam standoff.In the summit, the two leaders decided to issue “strategic guidance” to their militaries to strengthen communications so that they can build trust and understanding.Modi and Xi held their second informal summit in Mamallapuram near Chennai in October last year with a focus on further broadening bilateral ties.

Through their work, they have brought new perspectives and have helped build trust and confidence among the communities we serve,” he said.“Through their commitment and innovative approaches, they embrace a standard of excellence that is an inspiration to all blue helmets everywhere. As we confront today's challenges, their work has never been more important or relevant.”This is the first time the UN Military Gender Advocate award has gone to an Indian peacekeeper. This is the second year in a row that a Brazilian peacekeeper has received this honour.Created in 2016, the award recognises the dedication and effort of an individual military peacekeeper in promoting the principles of the UN Security Resolution 1325,, which is on women, peace and security in a peace operation as nominated by Heads and Force Commanders of peace operations.For the first time, two peacekeepers will receive the award jointly.Gawani expressed her gratitude for her work being recognised.“Whatever our function, position or rank, it is our duty as peacekeepers to integrate an all-genders perspective into our daily work and own it in our interactions with colleagues as well as with communities,” she said in a statement issued here.Gawani joined the Indian Army in 2011 where she graduated from the Officers Training Academy, then joined the Army Signal Corps.She holds Bachelor of Telecommunication Engineering and a Bachelor of Education degrees from Military College of Telecommunication, and the Government Post Graduate College in Dehradun, respectively.Since her deployment to the UNMISS in December 2018, Gawani mentored over 230 UN Military Observers (UNMO) on conflict-related sexual violence and ensured the presence of women military observers in each of the mission’s team sites.“By providing support, mentoring, guidance and leadership, she helped to create enabling environment for UN Peacekeepers,” the statement said, adding that Gawani also trained the South Sudanese government forces and helped them launch their action plan on conflict-related sexual violence.The Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award is underpinned by the principles outlined in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 and follow-up resolutions on women, peace and security.The resolutions call on actors to mainstream a gender perspective in all aspects of peacekeeping and peacebuilding and to ensure women's participation in peace and political processes.They also call for the protection from and prevention of conflict-related sexual violence and for an expansion of the role and contribution of women in UN operations, including of uniformed women peacekeepers.The statement said that about 6.4 per cent of the 85,000 uniformed peacekeepers serving currently in the UN missions are women.The UN is working with member states to increase the number and percentage of women military, police and justice and corrections personnel.It added that in this context promoting the participation of women, both in peacekeeping and within the societies in which we serve, is at the centre of the UN’s efforts.

On Friday, he was spotted by people of the area frothing at his mouth and retching during the daytime though relatives claim his condition showed improvement in the night,” the inspector said.Soon after he was found dead, Mandal’s relatives dug up the ground on which the hut of the deceased stood and buried the body deep inside.“A neighbour informed the police station within hours and we rushed to the spot and got the body exhumed and took it to the cremation ghat where the last rites were performed,” Sudhanshu said.Some neighbours suspected that he might have been murdered by relatives following a tiff and the body was buried to erase the evidence, the inspector said.“We have not registered a murder case so far but have preserved the viscera and further action may be taken if reports point towards foul play,” he said.Mental illness seems to run in the family of the deceased as none of his relatives appeared sound during interrogation, Sudhanshu said.“Some did claim that they were too poor to afford a cremation so did whatever they could within their means. But the claim does not sound credible.“None of the neighbours was approached by them for help nor did they try to inform the civic authorities. Help is extended in such cases without charging anything. But strangely they never sought help. Investigations are on,” said the inspector.

25-05-2020||Ravi S Singh||Labour unions internationalise labour issue for second time; seek ILO’s greater intervention||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 25The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has intervened with the Union Government to a complaint to it by the Central Trade Unions (CTUs) to ensure proper implementation of the labour laws, but they have approached it yet again jointly seeking it intercede with greater force.The move to internationalise the development within the country by the unions, which are dominated by the Left-leaning and anti-BJP outfits, is bound to raise concerns in the government quarters.The unions’ insistence with the world panel, especially the timing of it in the context of geopolitical developments of the Indo-China direct face-off at borders, will rankle within the establishment.India has just assumed the chairmanship of the executive board of the WHO, which is pressing for probe in the provenance and spread of COVID-19, with China in the eye of the storm.Many believe that China was trying to wriggle out from the corona issue by trying to deflect attention by the way of aggressive posturing through red-herrings.Even while the dust is yet to settle on the controversy over the unions, the first attempt to internationalise labour issues comes the second complaint to the ILO with the more caustic tone, which is bound to fuel sharper debate in the matter.“With all above quotes of the Constitution of India and the ILO decision, we feel that at this very turbid and uncertain situation, the ILO must powerfully and effectively intervene to prevail upon the Government of India to refrain from such exercise of abrogation of all basic labour rights unilaterally trampling underfoot the basic concept of social partnership and tripartism as espoused by the ILO,” the unions said in their complaint to the office of the director-general (DH) of the Geneva-based ILO.In response to the first letter dated May 14, office of ILO’s DG informed the unions on May 22 that the latter had “intervened” with the Union Government and appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “send a clear message to the states” to adhere to the country’s international commitment.Another highlight of the DG’s intimation to the union is that he had appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “encourage engagements in affective social dialogue” — a line which appears to be discursive and ambiguous in the context of labour issues.Apparently unsatisfied by the response, the unions urged the ILO for intervention with greater ballast.These unions include the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), the All-India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), the Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS), the All-India United Trade Union Centre (AIUTUC), the Trade Union Coordination Centre (TUCC), the Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), the All-India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), the Labour Progressive Federation (LPF) and the United Trade Union Congress (UTUC).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/labour-unions-internationalise-labour-issue-for-second-time-seek-ilos-greater-intervention-89829
25-05-2020||New Delhi||Took lessons from swine flu outbreak, devised ‘intelligent testing strategy’ against COVID-19: ICMR||The government devised an “intelligent testing strategy” and scaled up its preparedness to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, taking lessons from the 2009 swine-flu outbreak that had “exposed glaring gaps” in the country's diagnosis infrastructure, the ICMR said on Monday.The apex health research body said to cater to the increasing need for testing, India developed an “intelligent testing strategy to remain ahead of the virus” by significantly shoring up its diagnosis infrastructure.The country now has 610 laboratories — 432 public and 178 private — which are currently testing 1.1 lakh samples daily.The testing capacity had been increased to 1.4 lakh samples per day, which was being further raised to 2 lakh, it said.Keeping in view the revised understanding of the virus and the research work being done in India and elsewhere, testing criteria was widened to include returnees from abroad, migrant labourers and COVID-19 frontline workers.Most states have been working with the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) to deploy TrueNAT machines for COVID-19 testing.Through this machine, testing was done in such areas/districts where modern virological laboratory in private or public didn’t exist, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said.“Due to this, the testing infrastructure is not overwhelmed in any state to date. No state has a significant backlog of samples to be tested. More labs are being set up and additional machines are deployed in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal as well as in the rest of the country to meet the possible higher requirement,” it said.“A decade ago, when India witnessed one of the worst flu pandemics — swine flu in 2009 — the public health system was paralysed due to severe dearth of infrastructure for molecular diagnosis of viral infections... public health professionals helplessly watched the pandemic quickly escalating to all parts of the country,” the ICMR said.Though the country was equipped to carry out serology-based ELISA or rapid blood tests, the virus was challenging and could not be detected in the blood.Molecular virological test was the only option for detection of H1N1 and it was available only in two institutions — the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi, it said.“The event was an eye-opener for the public health system of the country wherein glaring gaps in testing capacity were brought out," the health research body said adding that this, in turn, paved the way for strengthening molecular diagnostic facilities for viruses in India through the Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) Network,” the ICMR said.“Contrary to 2009, in January 2020, when the threat of COVID19 epidemic knocked at our doors, the government could immediately scale up its preparedness by standardising diagnostic assays at the ICMR – NIV, Pune, and immediately commissioning diagnostic facility in 13 VRDLs based on their location in cities with international airports,” the ICMR added.It said COVID-19 being an imported infection, the labs were mapped based on their presence in cities where flights from China and other countries with reported coronavirus infections would land.The government took a number of steps including the difficult decision of lockdown to slow down the spread of the virus and prepare healthcare infrastructure “to trace, track, test, quarantine, treat and save precious lives of people”, the ICMR said.With the country lacking adequate testing facilities in every district, it adopted an “intelligent testing strategy” to trace and track the virus and anticipate areas where testing would be required and all possible institutions both in the public or private-like laboratories, universities and private medical colleges were identified.The AIIMS-like institutions were roped in, to handhold these institutions especially private medical colleges and private labs while lab technicians were trained to handle the sample and carry out tests with accuracy.The supply of testing kits was ensured and Indian companies were helped to develop and scale up indigenous production of testing kits while ensuring they adhered to the quality and standards.The government had been always sensitive not only to the present requirement but also about future needs of testing both of its scale and regions. All such areas were mapped which are under-served and suitable strategy developed, the ICMR said.This led to developing COVID-19 molecular diagnostic capacity in ‘difficult to reach’ areas such as Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Sikkim, Ladakh, Goa, Andaman and Nicobar Islands among other, it said, adding that from 13 laboratories in the first week of February and 123 laboratories on March 24, India now had 610 COVID-19 testing labs.Taking cognisance of the expected surge in cases due to influx of migrant workers in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Odisha, the ICMR has proactively followed up these states to expand testing.

25-05-2020||New Delhi||Government schemes leave India's informal sector workers cold||A survey of the most vulnerable sections of the population has found that the promised benefits in the form of gas, cash and foodgrains have proved too inadequate for most of them.“This has the potential to render countless citizens short on food, cash and security across aspects of their lives,” warns a snap survey of India’s informal sector workers, many of whom have remained invisible even now.Despite this, there has been little to no urgency by state actors to extend protection and security to these workers. Rather, many states have dismantled existing labour protection laws in a bid to inflate capital inflow and growth.“Those schemes which have been announced so far only cover a miniscule section of registered construction workers through direct cash transfers,”’ summarised the survey of construction workers, street vendors, sanitation workers and work-from-home females carried by Institute of Social Studies Trust, mainly in Delhi.A fraction of construction workers has been covered. Though Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said Rs 5,000 has been deposited twice in the account of construction workers, the survey found that it reached only 40,000 of the 5.4 lakh registered workers because many had not renewed their registrations. Delhi needs to emulate 20 states that have given money to all workers regardless of the renewal state. Delhi is estimated to have 10-12 lakh registered and unregistered construction workers out of roughly 5.5 crore nation-wide.The tale of street vendors is similar though many vegetable and street vendors were able to make a comeback. But the economic impact has been extreme with informal production lines, which supported three others, having shut down and hawkers gone off the streets. Many of the vendors, including women, have fallen into a debt trap. In Delhi, those who were from nearby areas were able to go home but the rest, all living in rented accommodation, may have been part of the second exodus.Waste workers, who thought they were in the exempt category, were the first to face police lathis when they ventured out at 4 am because few had the papers to prove their identity. Many of them did not venture out both because of fear of the police and contracting the epidemic. They never thought of returning as they had no source of income in the villages. Ultimately there was a major impact of the lockdown on their earnings.Home-based women workers have been the biggest silent sufferers, having lost their entire incomes due to closure of factories and payments withheld by sub-contractors. Many respondents to the survey, with large household sizes and those without appropriate documents, said they faced food shortages. The difficulty is aggravated in case of single women and female-headed households. The survey mostly spoke to women among these sectors who also narrated the issues facing their menfolk.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-schemes-leave-indias-informal-sector-workers-cold-89822

25-05-2020||New Delhi||Heatwave likely to abate only after May 28; dust storm, thunderstorm expected on May 29-30: IMD||Dust and thunderstorms are likely over several parts of north India on May 29-30, bringing the much-needed relief from the intense heatwave, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday.Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and parts of Uttar Pradesh have been experiencing blistering heat for days with temperatures soaring over 45 degrees Celsius in some places.The IMD had on Sunday issued a red colour-coded alert for north India for May 25-26 when the prevailing heatwave conditions are expected to peak.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the Regional Meteorological Department of the IMD, said due to a western disturbance and easterly winds, dust storm and thunderstorm activity is likely over Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on May 29-30.The wind speed is also likely to be around 50-60 kilometres per hour during this period, Srivastava said, adding that this will bring relief from the intense heat.A western disturbance is a cyclonic storm that originates in the Mediterranean Sea and travels across Central Asia.

Gag order issued in Maharashtra," Mumbai BJP spokesperson Suresh Nakhua tweeted while posting a copy of the order.The advisory from the police comes when the BMC and other agencies are grappling with the surge in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai, Pune and other places.

25-05-2020||New Delhi||SC allows IA to operate international flights with middle seats occupied||The Supreme Court on Monday allowed Air India to operate international flights with middle seats occupied for next 10 days even as it pulled up the national carrier over COVID-19 safety norms. “We are of the considered view that the petitioner, Air India, should be allowed to operate non-scheduled flights with the middle seats booking up to 6th June, 2020,” a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said.  The top court sent the matter back to the Bombay High Court, which had on May 22 questioned IA over not following physical distancing norms on board its international flights. The high court is scheduled to take up the matter on June 2.“However, after that the Air India will operate  non-scheduled flights in accordance with the  interim order to be passed by the Bombay High Court thereafter,” the Bench ordered.The order came on a petition filed by the Centre and Air India challenging a Bombay High Court order asking Air India to explain why it was not keeping middle seats vacant in its international flights in terms of physical distancing norms in force due to COVID19 pandemic.Acting on a petition by a pilot, the high court had sought responses from Air India and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on alleged violation of March 23 circular issued by the Centre in this regard.During the hearing, the Bench made it clear that it was distributed to know that Air India was giving precedence to commercial considerations over COVID19 safety norms. Government should be worried more about health of citizens than that of the airline, it said.However, it agreed to grant concession after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta pointed out that passengers stranded on foreign soil at airports would face immense difficulty as they had already been issued valid tickets for travel. “This has resulted in a lot of anxiety and difficulties arising from want of proper shelter, money, etc, at foreign airports, Mehta said, in  some cases the travel plan of families travelling together would be disrupted  because  those booked middle  seats will have to be off-loaded and left behind. While passing the order giving concession to IA, the top court said: “We would normally be not inclined to interfere with the interim orders made by the courts below.”The top court said: “The Director General of Civil Aviation is free to alter any norms he may consider necessary during the pendency of the matter in the interest of public health and safety of the passengers rather than of commercial considerations”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-allows-ia-to-operate-international-flights-with-middle-seats-occupied-89806

Today, the country is producing more than three lakh PPEs and N95 masks per day,” the Ministry said.It said states and UTs, as well as central institutions, had been provided with around 111.08 lakh N95 masks and around 74.48 lakh PPEs.

The swarms later headed towards Dausa district.The swarms are travelling farther and damaging trees as there are no standing crops for them to feed on, an official said.In the Murlipura and Vidhyadhar Nagar areas, Jaipur, people beat ‘thalis’ at the locusts that had settled on walls and trees, hoping to make them move on.“The menace of locust has spread to 18 districts of Rajasthan and they are rapidly travelling in search of food,” said Om Prakash, Commissioner, state Agriculture Department.Locust Ataack in Jaipur 🤮 pic.twitter.com/QWHfOXasvf  He said the swarms were in Nagaur and reached Jaipur and nearby areas on Sunday. They were seen in residential areas of the city on Monday and then they moved towards Dausa, Prakash said.“There is no standing crop on the ground so they are staying on large trees and moving fast. Locust control teams conducted operations by sprinkling pesticide in Jaipur last night and today remaining swarms have moved towards Dausa,” he said.Centre’s Locust Warning Organisation in Jodhpur and the state Agriculture Department are working in coordination to handle the locust attack issue.The latest such attack occurred on April 11 when the swarms entered from Pakistan and damaged cotton crops in Ganganagar to some extent.The swarms later travelled to various other districts and have now crossed Jaipur.Rajasthan Agriculture Minister Lalchand Kataria conducted field visit and met the farmers.The director of the agriculture department informed that 200 teams are working in the field to monitor the movement of locusts and nearly 800 tractor-mounted sprayers are being used.The Commissioner in the state Agriculture Department said the fire department was also involved in the operations against the locusts. The swarms had covered almost 54,000-hectare area in the state this time and containment operations were conducted in 40,000-hectare area, he added.

25-05-2020||New Delhi||Wheat procurement surpasses last year's figures; Punjab leads||Procurement of wheat by government agencies this year surpassed last year’s figures of 341.31 Lakh Metric Tonnes (LMT) to touch 341.56 LMT as on May 24, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said on Monday.Overcoming impediments created due to the spread of COVID-19 virus, country-wide lockdown and other issues, the ministry said the figure surpasses last year’s procurement by 25,000 tonnes Punjab is leading with 125.84 LMT followed by Madhya Pradesh and HaryanaWheat harvesting generally starts towards end of March and procurement commences in the first week of April every year. However, with the imposition of national lockdown on March 23, all operations came to a standstill. Since the crop was already ready for harvesting, the central government gave relaxation to start agricultural and related activities during the lockdown period and the procurement could start from April 15 in most of the procuring states, officials saidIn Haryana it started a little later on April 20.Officials say their biggest challenge was to ensure procurement is done safely during the pandemic, which was achieved through a multi-pronged strategy of awareness creation, social distancing and deployment of technology. Number of purchase centres was increased substantially reducing the farmer footfalls in individual purchase centres. New centres were set up using every facility available at gram panchayat level and the numbers were increased sharply in the major procuring states like Punjab where it went up from 1836 to 3681, 599 to 1800 in Haryana and from 3545 to 4494 in Madhya Pradesh. Farmers were provided specific dates and slots using technology to bring their produce, which helped in avoiding crowding. Strict social distancing norms were followed and sanitization activities were undertaken regularly. In Punjab, every farmer was allotted specific spaces earmarked for dumping of stocks and no one else was allowed to enter those areas. Only people who were directly associated were allowed to be present during daily auctions.Apart from virus there were other challenges this time. As all the Jute mills were closed, production of bags used for filling stopped, creating a major crisis. This was tackled by using more plastic bags, supplemented by used bags with very strict quality conditions.Then unseasonal rains in all major producing states led  to wheat getting exposed to water. This posed a major threat to the farmers as such stocks could not be procured under normal specifications. “Government of India and Food Corporation of India (FCI) intervened immediately and after conducting detailed scientific analysis, specifications were re-fixed to ensure that no farmer is put to distress while making sure that the produce so procured meets the minimum quality requirements of the consumers,” they said.Third challenge was the tight labour supply position as well as the general fear created among the masses about the virus. This was addressed by taking a series of confidence-building measures at the local level by the state administration. Total procurement 341.56 LMTPunjab - 125.84 LMTMadhya Pradesh - 113.38 LMTHaryana- 70.65 LMTUttar Pradesh- 20.39 LMTRajasthan- 10.63 LMTUttarakhand- 0.31LMTGujarat -0.21LMTChandigarh -0.12LMTHimachal Pradesh -0.03 LMT||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wheat-procurement-surpasses-last-years-figures-punjab-leads-89782

Such 'dadagiri' will not be tolerated. Don't think that we (BJP) are not in power. We had ruled here for 15 years. Don't think that these saffron-clad BJP workers are weak. Forget about discriminating against BJP workers by sitting in the district and tehsil offices," she is heard saying in the video.The minister further said: "I know very well how to hit after pulling out a belt in a dark room".She also questioned the officials about the "improper" upkeep of quarantine centres "despite the Union government sending enough money".On Sunday, Singh said the concerned youth had shot a video of the quarantine centre, which became viral."After that, a tehsildar and Janpad Panchayat CEO, instead of looking into the arrangements at the quarantine centre, thrashed him brutally (on May 16). On the same night, the youth was shifted to another quarantine centre (in Daura village)."When his father came to know about the incident, he approached me, following which I spoke to officials who denied any such incident had happened," she said.Singh demanded strict action against officials, saying the youth was being falsely implicated into a case of violation of quarantine protocols.Slamming Singh, Congress MP Chhaya Verma said: "Such language against them by Renuka Singh has exposed the real face and character of the ruling BJP at the Centre."Meanwhile, the district administration has ordered an inquiry into the alleged assault on the youth.

25-05-2020||New Delhi||Chaos prevails as domestic flight services resume after 2 months amid 630 cancellations||Domestic air travel resumed on Monday after two months even as a number of states were unenthusiastic about opening up their airports in view of rising COVID-19 cases causing around 630 flights to be cancelled.According to aviation industry sources, around 630 domestic flights of Monday were cancelled due to the Centre's Sunday night announcement that there would be no flights in West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh, and limited operations at major airports such as Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad.Consequently, many passengers reached the airports on Monday only to be told by the airline staff that their flights had been cancelled. Many people took to social media to vent their anger.Union Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Monday evening, "From no domestic passenger flights yesterday to 532 flights and 39,231 passengers today, action has returned to Indian skies. With Andhra Pradesh set to resume operations from tomorrow & West Bengal from May 28, these numbers are all set to increase further."According to a source, on May 22, bookings had opened for around 1,100 domestic flights for Monday.The airlines, which were allowed to operate one-third of their pre-lockdown domestic services, have been busy since Sunday night to further rework their flight schedules.The first flight on Monday took off from Delhi for Pune at 4.45 am under strict regulations recommended by civil aviation authorities. The first flight from Mumbai was to Patna at 6.45 am.States like Maharashtra, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, which are home to some of the busiest airports in the country, were reluctant to allow domestic flight services from their airports, citing swelling COVID-19 cases there.West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh governments did not relent to the requests by the Civil Aviation Ministry to allow flight services from Monday.It was decided on Sunday that Kolkata and Bagdogra airports in cyclone-hit West Bengal will not operate any domestic flight between May 25 and 27 but will handle 20 flights each daily from May 28.Moreover, Vijayawada and Vizag airports in Andhra Pradesh will handle just 20 per cent of their pre-lockdown flights from May 26.Mumbai airport, which is India's second busiest airport, will handle only 50 flights daily from Monday, the Centre said, adding Chennai airport will see only 25 arrivals per day.There were no limits set on departures from Chennai airport.Moreover, Hyderabad in Telangana will handle just 30 flights every day from Monday, the government said.IndiGo president and chief operating officer Wolfgang Prock-Schauer visited the Delhi airport to observe operations on Monday. He said the airline's operations were running smoothly and passengers were feeling relaxed as there was much less air traffic on Monday."We visited some of the boarding gates. Passengers are well informed (about rules and regulations). Despite the short lead time we got from the central authorities and the states, we were able to disseminate this information," he added.An IndiGo spokesperson said 20,000 passengers will travel on Monday onboard the airline's flights.SpiceJet said its first flight on Monday took off from Ahmedabad at 6.05 am and reached Delhi at 7.10 am. The budget carrier said it also operated 20 flights on Monday on routes awarded under the government's regional connectivity UDAN scheme.SpiceJet chairman and managing director Ajay Singh said, "We are delighted to have resumed our flight operations in a completely smooth manner and by following every safety guideline and protocol laid down by the government."Airlines were jittery in resuming services as multiple states have put in place separate norms and conditions for quarantining passengers arriving there by domestic flights.With the aviation sector reeling under severe stress due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown that began on March 25, the government had last week announced resumption of domestic flight services from May 25 under specific rules and guidelines.It had set a cap on ticket pricing, made wearing of face masks by passengers mandatory, no food served onboard planes and making available details of medical conditions by travellers through the Aarogya Setu app or by filling up of a self-declaration form.The app gives colour-coded designation to users according to their health status and travel history. It helps the users know if they were near anyone who tested COVID-19 positive.Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Bihar, Punjab, Assam and Andhra Pradesh, among others, have announced their own quarantine measures for passengers arriving at their airports. Some states have decided to put passengers in institutional quarantine while several others have talked about putting them in home quarantine.Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Saturday had questioned the need for quarantine if a passenger shows green status on the Aarogya Setu app. The green status signifies that a passenger is safe.The Maharashtra government had requested the Centre on Sunday to keep air services in the state at a minimum possible level."It has been a long day of hard negotiations with various state govts to recommence civil aviation operations in the country," Puri tweeted on Sunday night, adding, "Except Andhra Pradesh which will start on 26/5 and West Bengal on 28/5, domestic flights will recommence across the country from tomorrow (Monday)."

His condition suddenly worsened two days ago and he was rushed to the emergency where he was put on ventilator support. It was too late by then. It was also only when he was brought to the emergency that his COVID 19 test was done. We are distraught,”Singh told The Tribune today.He also said Heera Lal, who handled the entire sanitation effort at AIIMS, did not have protective gear.“People whose roles need them to engage with all kinds of potential infection sources should get priority in protective gear. We have hundreds of sanitation staffers who are constantly on the job and at risk,” Singh said.Heera Lal himself has been on duty ever since the COVID pandemic struck.Senior doctors at AIIMS remember him for his smiling face and enthusiastic spirit.Now that he’s gone, he leaves behind many questions about the constant dangers sanitation staffers at crowded hospitals are facing.It remains to be seen if ICMR’s new directions to administerhydroxychloroquine to COVID warriors in containment zones covers cleaners and sanitation warriors, who are the bedrock of hospital disinfection in these critical times.Only two days ago former AIIMS HOD Medicine JN Pande had also died of COVID.The story has been updated with a rejoinder from the AIIMS given below:Describing the charge, that the deceased sanitation chief did not have protective gear, as "totally baseless and incorrect", AIIMS, New Delhi said the institution has been providing appropriate Personal Protection Equipment including N95 masks, biosafety overall etc to all its healthcare workers irrespective of the cadre or mode of engagement."Heera Lal was provided timely care and admitted immediately when he reported to the Emergency Department on 19th May 2020. He was suffering from long standing COPD and type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and was under follow up at concerned departments for his disease condition. He presented with acute exacerbation of symptoms and was on ventilator support in ICU. Unfortunately, he succumbed, despite best of efforts by the treating team", Aarti Vij, Chairperson of AIIMS Media and Protocol Division said in a statement adding the hospital was in grief for having lost one of its warriors against Covid19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aiims-sanitation-chief-dies-of-covid-never-missed-a-day-of-duty-89775

It first saw action during the 1971 Indo-Pak war and operated out of Srinagar with the task of defending the Kashmir Valley. Sekhon, then just 28 and hailing from Ludhiana, was part of the deployment. On December 14, 1971, Sekhon, along with another officer, scrambled to counter an attack by Pakistan aircraft and shot three enemy Sabre jets in aerial combat. His own aircraft was hit and he went down. For his actions, he was decorated with the highest gallantry award.After the war, the Gnats were replaced with HAL Ajeet in 1975. In May 1989, when the squadron was at Hindon, it received the MiG-27 and its role changed from air defence to ground attack. It then moved to Kalaikunda in the North-East, where it was awarded the President’s Standards in 2015 before flying into the sunset.The Flying Bullets would be the second IAF squadron to fly the Tejas. In 2016, the IAF had raised its first Tejas unit, No. 45 Squadron, the ‘Flying Daggers’, which is also based at Salur. It was this squadron, then operating the MiG 21 Bison that had shot down a Pakistani Atlantique aircraft over the Rann of Kutch in 1999.While the aircraft with 45 Squadron are of the Initial Operational Clearance (IOC) configuration, those being inducted in 18 Squadron are of the more advanced Final Operational Clearance (FOC) configuration. The IAF has so far ordered 40 Tejas aircraft and, according to reports, intends to procure a further 83. Tejas is a single-engine, delta wing, lightweight multirole fighter with a payload capacity of 4,300 kg and a combat range of 500 km.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/squadron-of-iafs-sole-pvc-recipient-nirmaljit-sekhon-to-take-to-the-skies-again-89771

After the brick kiln shut down during the lockdown, they applied online to return home with the assistance of the government but did not get any response.Her husband said that he and his wife, along with 42 other people had collectively paid Rs 1.2 lakh for their journey on a private bus. When Fatima's condition deteriorated, the couple was dropped off by the bus driver on National Highway 24 in the Bithri Chainpur area of Bareilly, from where a 108 ambulance took them to the district hospital.The bus driver, however, refused to wait and left for the destination with other passengers.Doctor Varsha Agarwal, who is treating Fatima at the district hospital, said, "The woman had already delivered twins on the bus and both of them had died when she reached here. Her condition is stable but she is upset. She was only six months pregnant. Her samples would be sent for Covid-19 tests as she was travelling from another district and may have been exposed to the infection." Earlier, on Friday, another migrant woman, aged about 21 years, had delivered a pair of twin boys at Sirathu in Kaushambhi district in a Shramik Special train that was on its way to Varanasi from Vapi in Gujarat.However, the newborn twins died hours later after they were born and rushed to a primary health centre for treatment.The woman was identified as Gayatri Devi and was eight-months pregnant. She was travelling along with her husband Bhaiyya Lal.Gayatri gave birth to twin boys in the moving train sometime after the train crossed Bharwari in Kaushambhi with the help of other women passengers.As soon as the authorities were informed, the train was made to stop at Sirathu railway station and the mother and the twins were rushed to the primary health centre in an ambulance.Chief medical superintendent of Kaushambhi district hospital Deepak Seth said that the babies were born premature and could not survive.Gayatri has been admitted to the isolation ward of the district hospital.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-migrant-woman-delivers-in-bus-twins-die-within-minutes-of-being-born-89767

With this, the tally has pushed to 7,300-mark in Rajasthan on Monday, with the death toll risen to 167.A 34-year-old man of Varanasi (UP) succumbed to viral illness at Railway Hospital at Abu Road in Sirohi district, while a 58-year-old man of Gandhidham (Gujarat) died at Ajmer’s JLN hospital, a medical bulletin said.Another 76-year-old man of Ajmer’s Nala Bazar also succumbed at Ajmer hospital while a fourth patient, a 21-year-old woman who tested positive on Monday, was brought to SMS hospital, Jaipur.Among the 272 new confirmed cases, Pali reported 50, Nagaur 48, Jodhpur 47, Sikar 44, Churu 17, Jaipur 13, Udaipur 12, Sirohi 9, Kota 7, Alwar 5, Barmer 5, Jalore 5, Rajsamand 3, Jhunjhunu 3, and Bhilwara 1, Dausa 1, Dungarpur 1 and Sawaimadhopur 1.The tally in the state is increasing due to migrants’ better screening and testing.

25-05-2020||New Delhi||India now among 10 worst-hit countries as COVID-19 cases rise to 7,000 in 24 hrs||India has entered the list of 10 countries worst hit by COVID-19 after record spike in the number of cases for four consecutive days, pushing the tally of infections to over 1.38 lakh, surpassing Iran, according to the John Hopkins University data.The country registered 154 deaths and a record jump of 6,977 cases in the last 24 hours, taking the nationwide tally to 1,38,845 and death toll to 4,021 on Monday with some experts attributing the spike in cases to the lockdown relaxations, including partial resumption of rail services and road transport along with the return of the migrant workers, while others say the rise in cases is due to enhanced testing capacity in the country.Domestic passenger flights also resumed operations on Monday after a gap of two months.India is the tenth most affected nation by the pandemic after US, Russia, UK, Spain, Italy, Brazil, Germany, Turkey and France, as per the JHU data.The country has recorded 6,088, 6,654, 6,767 and 6977 on May 22, 23, 24 and 25, respectively. Also, the number of RT-PCR tests for detection of COVID-19 in the country crossed the 30-lakh mark on Monday.Commenting on the partial resumption of rail and road transport services, Dr Chandrakant S Pandav, former president of Indian Public Health Association and Indian Association of Preventive and social medicine said these relaxations will create an enabling environment for the coronavirus infection to flourish.“Now, the government will have to ensure strong surveillance and monitoring so as to curb the infection which otherwise will overwhelm the healthcare system,” said Pandav, former HoD of the Centre for Community Medicine at the AIIMS.However, Professor K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India said an increase in the number of cases reflects both an increase in testing rates and an increase in spread.“What we need to see is the number of new tests performed per day and the number of new cases that were identified from them. We also have to see if the testing criteria have remained the same between the two periods of comparison. We may open up gradually but will have to continue case detection, contact tracing and follow personal protection measures as vigorously as possible,” he added.Noted lung surgeon Dr Arvind Kumar cautioned that given the COVID-19 situation right now, “India is heading towards a very chaotic situation from here on”.“The rate at which the thousands of cases are being reported per day, we will be moving upwards in the top 10 countries bracket which we have entered now,” he said.Kumar, who works at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here, said, the first lockdown and to a certain extent the second phase of lockdown was “managed well”.“However, from third lockdown onwards, a series of disastrous steps have been taken by authorities, from the opening of liquor shops and then resuming of flights from today. If the flights were not resumed for another two weeks, what harm would have happened,” he asked.Kumar warned that by end of June, “India is going to see a massive surge in the number of cases”.Dr Vikas Maurya, Additional Director and head of pulmonology, at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh here, said, “with the reopening of economy, we will see a surge for sure in the initial period”.“Whether that surge will abate or continue to rise, will depend on how the situation is managed by the authorities at all levels, and how people behave in public at large,” he said.“This lockdown hopefully has taught people to be more disciplined, practice social distancing, and so, the future scenario will also depend on how our demographically diverse population behaves,” the doctor said.Maurya cautioned that if the cases do not abate in few weeks, the lockdown should be imposed again, “otherwise things will go out of control”The first two phases of the lockdown led to 14 to 29 lakh COVID-19 cases being averted while the number of lives saved in that period was between 37,000 and 78,000, the government said on Friday citing various studies and asserted that the unprecedented shutdown has paid “rich dividends” in the fight against the pandemic.The number of active COVID-19 cases climbed to 77,103 on Monday while 57,720 people have recovered and one patient has migrated, it said.“Thus, around 41.57 per cent patients have recovered so far,” a senior health ministry official said.Through a graded, pre-emptive and proactive approach, the government is taking several steps along with the states and UTs for prevention, containment and management of COVID-19.These were being regularly reviewed and monitored at the highest level, the ministry said on Monday.The total 4,021 fatalities include 1,635 deaths from Maharashtra followed by Gujarat with 858 deaths, Madhya Pradesh 290, West Bengal 272, Delhi 261, Rajasthan 63, Uttar Pradesh 161, Tamil Nadu 111 and Andhra Pradesh 56.Maharashtra has reported 50,231 COVID-19 cases, highest in the country, and is followed by Tamil Nadu (16,277), Gujarat (14,056), Delhi (13,418),  Rajasthan (7,028), Madhya Pradesh (6,665) and Uttar Pradesh (6,268), West Bengal (3,667), Andhra Pradesh (2,823) and Bihar (2,587).

For other airports in Tamil Nadu flights would operate as in other parts of the country, he had said.On Sunday night, while apprising the Centre that incoming domestic flights to this city can be restricted to 25 per day, the Tamil Nadu government had notified guidelines, which includes 14-day home quarantine and an e-pass for entry."Flights to Coimbatore, Madurai and Tiruchirappalli (the three other airports in the state) can be operated," Chief Secretary K Shanmugam had told the Centre in a letter.Due to high number of virus cases, flights from Gujarat and Maharashtra may be kept at the barest minimum level and "there is no issue for operating any number of outgoing flights from Tamil Nadu," Shanmugam had said.The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), which has separate norms for incoming and outgoing passengers and procedures to be followed at the airport, said asymptomatic people would undergo home quarantine for 14 days.It said if air journey was undertaken without meeting the eligibility criteria they would be liable for penal action.

25-05-2020||Lucknow||Yogi nod needed before states re-employ UP migrant workers||Migrant workers who wish to return to their places of work after the lockdown is lifted, may no longer find the going easy now.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has said that his government will lay down stringent conditions for ensuring social security of workers from the state who are hired by other states.“Other states will also need to seek permission from his government before engaging workers from UP,” he said while addressing a webinar on Sunday.The Chief Minister stated, “If any state wants manpower, the state government will have to guarantee social security and insurance of the workers. Without our permission they will not be able to take our people,” he said.He said all migrant workers who have returned to the state were being registered and their skills were being mapped by the administration. Any state or entity interested in hiring them will need to take care of their social, legal and monetary rights.Speaking about the challenges his administration had faced during this crisis, the Chief Minister said, “When I talk of Uttar Pradesh, then it is natural to say that it is the state with the highest population. We have faced several challenges during the  lockdown. At the beginning, migrant workers and labourers started coming to the state. We deployed 16,000 buses and within 24 hours, they were brought back to their home districts and arrangements were made to screen them.”Yogi Adityanath took a dig at the opposition leaders for the migrant crisis.“During the lockdown, if those who now raise slogans for the poor had honestly cared about workers, then migration could have been stopped. This did not happen. No facilities were  given. At several places, electricity connections were cut, so people had to migrate.” he said.Legal experts, meanwhile said that requiring government permission for employing people could face a legal challenge as the Constitution guarantees the freedom of movement and residence and employment of workers.“Article 19 (1)(D) guarantees freedom to move freely, and 19(1)(e) the freedom to settled in any part of the country so the need for permission can be legally challenged,” said a senior lawyer.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yogi-nod-needed-before-states-re-employ-up-migrant-workers-89761

25-05-2020||Satya Prakash||It’s time to err on the side of caution||THE role of media in making a democracy survive and thrive has been an undisputed proposition. The recent Supreme Court verdict in Arnab Goswami’s case lends further credence to the idea.“India's freedoms will rest safe as long as journalists can speak to power without being chilled by a threat of reprisal,” a Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud said even as it dismissed Goswami’s plea for transfer of his cases to the CBI.The verdict sends out clear messages to journalists, the state and society at large as the Supreme Court attempts to strike a proper balance between media freedom and accountability.First, the top court makes it clear that journalists don’t enjoy any extra privileges and their right to free speech is no higher than that of a common citizen. While exercising his/her right under Article 19(1)(a), a journalist is not immune from an investigation into an FIR arising out of his/her work. The right to free speech is not absolute and is subject to the reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2).The court refused to transfer his case to CBI, saying, “The displeasure of an accused person about the manner in which the investigation proceeds or an unsubstantiated allegation of a conflict of interest against the police conducting the investigation must not derail the legitimate course of law...”Second, the verdict protects media against abuse of process of law by the state by quashing multiples FIRs arising out the same cause of action. “This will destroy the freedom of the citizen to know of the affairs of governance in the nation and the right of the journalist to ensure an informed society,” it said, disapproving of the manner in which numerous FIRs were lodged in several states on the basis of identical allegations arising out of the same TV show.It’s time to err on the side of caution. As part of the institution, journalists play a vital role in informing, educating and entertaining their viewers and readers. They also set agenda for debate and act as watchdog for democracy. The verdict offers a sort of assurance to the society that in case either a journalist or the state transgresses the boundaries drawn by law, the judiciary is there to set them right. So far as media is concerned, the message is loud and clear: journalists are not immune from prosecution for what they publish or broadcast.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/its-time-to-err-on-the-side-of-caution-89447

India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for the procurement of 36 Rafale jets at a cost of around Rs 58,000 crore.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh received the first Rafale jet at an airbase in France on October 8. “We are helping the Indian Air Force in arranging the ferry flight of the first four Rafales from France to India as soon as possible. So there’s no reason today to speculate that the schedule will not be maintained,” the envoy said. France is reeling under swelling cases of coronavirus and has emerged as one of the worst-hit in Europe. There were apprehensions that the delivery of Rafale jets may be delayed.The IAF has already completed preparations, including readying required infrastructure and training of pilots, to welcome the fighter aircraft. The first squadron of the aircraft will be stationed at the Ambala station, considered one of the most strategically located IAF bases. The India-Pakistan border is 220 km from there.

We can't take long duration projects which are going to extend over a period of four to five years and give results. — VK Saraswat, NITI Aayog memberThe former Defence Research and Development Organisation chief said consultations are on with scientists and scientific institutions in this regard.“We are basically now looking for how to transform the R&D to meet the challenges.

Boundary between private, public, national laboratories, academic institutions should completely become impervious.

25-05-2020||---||China minister downplays LAC row||New Delhi, May 24The foreign offices of India and China have so far sought to underplay recent disagreements between their border troops at several places along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).A 90-minute press conference by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday covered a number of topics, but did not touch the LAC question which has been dominating the Indian social media and TV channels.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) here issued two statements on the incidents in one week — on May 14 and 21 — which is unusual. While expressing resolve to stand its ground and blaming Chinese troops for obstructing usual Indian patrols, the statements expressed hope in the existing mechanisms for sorting out troops disagreements.At his press conference, Wang had two options if had wanted to flag the LAC flashpoints. He could have made a suo motu statement, as he did on Hong Kong for instance or, the Chinese Foreign Office could have sounded out a resident Indian mediaperson to query a Wang about the tensions on the border. “That Wang chose neither option suggests that either the incidents are not grave enough in Beijing’s security calculus or it is occupied with other pressing matters,” said a China watcher.The MEA too has declined to be drawn in over reports that have given varying accounts of the incursions. In its first statement on May 14, a few days after Indian and Chinese troops had allegedly scuffled, the MEA explained the ground conditions under which the disagreements emerge and said both sides were attempting to maintain tranquility on the border.Issue not discussedA press conference by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi covered a number of topics, but did not touch the LAC question||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-minister-downplays-lac-row-89527
25-05-2020||Ajay Banerjee||China’s military posturing questions validity of treaties||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 24As India and China are locked in a tense military posturing at three separate points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, the efficacy of the border agreements and protocols comes under question.China is honouring none of agreements inked since 1993, probably trying to carve a “new normal” while attempting to alter the existing arrangements.The series of protocols ensured that the two sides knew which were the disputed sections of the LAC and agreed on the conduct of troops in those areas. The 3,488-km LAC running along the Himalayan ridgeline has several disputed points. The perception of where the LAC runs varies at certain places by several kilometres and troops of both countries patrol these disputed sections.The non-disputed areas were a strict no-go. What China is now doing at Galwan in eastern Ladakh is a situation that has not arisen since November 1962 — when India- China war ended. At Galwan, China is sitting some 3-4 km on the Indian side of the LAC, and this stretch, incidentally, is not disputed by either side.At the north bank of Pangong Tso — a 135-km glacial melt lake — troops have clashed, and two flag meetings have yielded nothing. China wants to keep India at least 8-10 km short of the present patrolling line.Since 1993 — the year, incidentally, coincides with the economic rise of India and China — the two countries have had a few key agreements aimed at ensuring peace along the LAC. In September 1993, the “Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the LAC in the India-China Border Areas” was inked. Since then, a series of agreements were signed dictating the conduct of soldiers and authorised a high-powered committee with members of both sides to sort out matters.In January 2012, the two countries inked a pact and established a “Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs”. It is tasked too“address issues and situations that may arise in the border areas that affect the maintenance of peace”.So far, China has been “threatening” India through news outlets owned by the Communist Party of China.Incidents at Galwan and Pangong Tso fly in the face of the 2005 protocol inked on “modalities for implementation of confidence-building measures in the military field along the LAC in the India-China border areas”. The mandate of the agreement is: “Neither side shall use force or threaten to use force against the other”. It also calls upon both sides to stop their activities (like patrols) in the disputed area and not advance any further. On coming face-to-face, troops unfurl a banner, asking the other to back off from the present position of patrolling. There are some 400-500 such banner drills done annually, but in the current stand-off the system has not worked.The Border Defence Cooperation Agreement inked in 2013 says both sides have to inform about military exercise and flying of aircraft. The two sides agreed that they shall not follow or tail patrols of the other side in areas where there is no common understanding of the LAC. China is flying helicopters very close to the LAC, India responded by flying out a team of Sukhoi 30 MKI jets, and patrol parties have jostled, fought and exchanged fisticuffs.What was inkedGround reality||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinas-military-posturing-questions-validity-of-treaties-89560

25-05-2020||New Delhi||We have lost faith in system: Migrants||Roshan Shrivastav (19) was looking forward to finally being able to vote since he turned adult a year ago, till enduring pain and suffering as a migrant during the lockdown shook his faith in the system.I have just become eligible to vote but I have vowed not to vote for any party or politician. Be it the coming Bihar polls, next General Election or any other elections in future. We feel cheated. — Roshan, Bihar residentA native of Bihar, Roshan arrived in Delhi to find a job and support his family. He is now desperate to return home.On Friday, Roshan along with his nephew Shivam Shrivastav (19) and friend Prince Gupta (21) were turned back by the police when they attempted to cross the Delhi-UP border in the hope of somehow reaching their homes in Bihar. The trio, who lived in a rented single-room flat in Delhi, said their landlord was “kind” to them and did not ask for rent. “Politicians play games with us around election times with fake and hollow promises,” Roshan said.Feeling that people like him have been “abandoned by the government” in this time of crisis and having “lost faith in the system”, Roshan said he has decided to either not cast his vote at all or choose the NOTA option in future elections.Shivam and Prince also said they would not vote at all in any election as the coronavirus crisis had exposed the fault lines. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-have-lost-faith-in-system-migrants-89589

25-05-2020||New Delhi||Flights start amid quarantine confusion||Indian skies will open up for domestic passenger flights from Monday after a gap of two months amid confusion over what quarantine rules may apply to the travellers but there will be minimum air services and delay in resumption in some states.Government officials said on Sunday night that the airports in Kolkata and Bagdogra in cyclone-hit West Bengal will not operate any domestic flight between May 25 and 27 but will handle 20 flights each per day from May 28.The airports in Mumbai and Hyderabad will daily handle 50 and 30 flights, respectively, from Monday, they said.

Vijayawada and Vizag airports in Andhra Pradesh will not operate any domestic flight on Monday but services will begin from Tuesday, they said.The revised schedule for resumption of airport operations followed reluctance by some states to deal with thousands of incoming passengers in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Bookings had opened for around 1,050 domestic flights planned for Monday, but the revised schedule has led to the cancellation of several flights leaving hundreds of passengers disappointed. The airlines were allowed to operate one-third of their capacity.As India enters the last week of the thrice extended lockdown for 68 days, the resumption of domestic flights comes at a time when new Covid cases in the country crossed 6,000 for the third consecutive day on Sunday, surging to a record single day spike of 6,767 infections. The fourth phase of national lockdown to fight the pandemic is due to end on May 31. The Union Health Ministry, meanwhile, issued its own set of guidelines for domestic air, rail and road travel and also said states can also develop their own protocol with regards to quarantine and isolation as per their assessment. Passengers were also advised to download the contact tracing application Aarogya Setu on their mobile devices. The ministry while listing out its quarantine protocol among other steps suggested thermal screening at entry and exit points. — PTIPunjab, TN, J&K insist on quarantineNo isolation, but app must: DelhiMaking Aarogya Setu app essential, the Delhi Government says the Centre’s norms will be followed for domestic travel.
