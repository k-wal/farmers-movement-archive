But, he made it clear that services on all routes will not be resumed and that only a limited number of trains would ply."We can now focus our strategy in this battle against coronavirus, as should be the case. We have a twofold challenge – to reduce the transmission rate of the disease, and to increase public activity gradually, while adhering to all the guidelines. We will have to work towards achieving both these objectives," he said."I am of the firm view that the measures needed in the first phase of lockdown were not needed during the second phase and similarly the measures needed in the third phase are not needed in the fourth," he told the chief ministers according to the statement.The PM asked the chief ministers to share by May 15 a broad strategy on how they want to deal with lockdown regime in their states.

The mega mission is aimed at evacuating stranded Indians from abroad.Shiv Sena head and chief minister of Maharashtra Uddhav Thackeray has been demanding arrangement of adequate number of special trains for safe return of migrant labourers to their home states.Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena, in an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ targeted the BJP over its candidates for the May 21 polls to the Legislative Council and said the opposition party does not have enough votes in the assembly to get its fourth candidate elected.The party chose a candidate like Gopichand Padalkar for MLC polls, who in the Lok Sabha elections had appealed to people to not vote for the BJP (Padalkar was not with BJP at that time). It has not given tickets to its key leaders like Vinod Tawde, Pankaja Munde and Eknath Khadse,” it said.The editorial expressed surprise over the candidate filed by the Congress, a constituent of the ruling coalition.It was expected that an aggressive and well educated person like Sachin Sawant will get Congress nomination,” it said.Sawant is Maharashtra Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson. The Congress has fielded Rajesh Rathod, a little known face. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-ignoring-domestic-migrant-workers-sena-mp-raut-83464

A good privacy policy has been made to ensure that personal data of people is not misused,” Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) Secretary Ajay Prakash Sawhney told reporters.Till date 9.8 crore people have downloaded the Aarogya Setu app.The app alerts its users if they come in close contact with any infected person.The Aarogya Setu app has been made mandatory in COVID-19 containment zones.The guidelines lay down procedure on handling of data by various agencies involved in controlling spread of the pandemic.The data can also be shared with universities for research purposes only after delinking details that can identify individuals using the app.“Any violation of these directions may lead to penalties as per section 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and other legal provisions as may be applicable,” the protocol said.The penalty clauses under the disaster management act have provisions for jail term for officials.Sawhney said that the most important function is the flow of data from the app to various departments where huge emphasis has been laid on privacy of individuals.“The app users are given device id which is used for processing various information and functions. The individual’s contact is used only to alert the user,” he said.The app is available on Android, Apple’s iOS and JioPhone.The government has also issued a toll free number 1921 for those who don’t have smartphones.“Less than 13,000 users of Aarogya Setu have been found to be COVID positive but due to help of this around 1.4 lakh were traced and alerted who have come in close contact with infected person. We provide this information to check an area from becoming a hotspot. Privacy is an important aspect of Aarogya Setu,” Sawhney said.Advocacy groups have alleged that the government is using Aarogya Setu for mass surveillance especially in absence of any legislation around privacy.“The protocol has been issued to bridge the legal gap and to address privacy related concerns,” a MeitY official said.Sawhney said data of a non-infected person is deleted from Aarogya Setu app in 30 days, 45 days in case of tests and 60 days if a person has undergone treatment.

11-05-2020||New Delhi||Took my positive COVID-19 report as new posting order, says recovered CRPF jawan||I took the news of contracting COVID-19 as my ‘new posting order’, like being sent to a Naxal or terrorist-affected area in the past, Satyabir Singh, 35-year-old CRPF jawan, said on Monday post-recovery.The head constable is a radio operator of the 31st battalion of the force that is based in Mayur Vihar Phase-III area of New Delhi.The unit made news recently after at least 134 troops living in its premises were found positive for COVID-19, while a 55-year-old sub-inspector succumbed to the disease, making it the first case of death from the pandemic among the various paramilitary forces.The way to defeat COVID-19 is that you should not take the report of your being positive for the disease to your heart and mind, Singh said.The jawan was discharged from Noida’s Sharda Hospital on May 9. He is back home practising self-quarantine for some more time. He was admitted to the hospital on April 23.However, his phone keeps ringing as he has now become the ‘agony aunt’ for the rest of his hospitalised troops and even those who are well.He says his friends now ask him various questions and doubts and seek his help to better prepare against the viral disease.“As soon as someone hears that he or she has COVID-19, they feel sad and deeply disappointed. But I can tell you from my experience that the disease is not to be feared about,” Singh told PTI over the phone.“Coronavirus beemari ko haraney ka tareeka hai ki isko dil aur dimaag par nahi lagana hai,” (One should not take the coronavirus positive report to one’s heart or mind), he says.I had been suffering from typhoid when I was detected with the pandemic, he said.“As soon as I got my COVID-19 report, I took it as my new posting. The hospital was my new battleground, from where I had to come back victorious and I did,” an exuberant Singh said.He has served tenures in the anti-Naxal operations grid of Chhattisgarh and in the counter-terrorism theatre of Kashmir as part of various CRPF units in his about 12 years of service.“I am the radio operator of the unit and as I am the most vital link between the unit on patrol and its base behind, I am trained to keep myself and my buddies safe. I have come back successfully and now I will ensure that all my battalion colleagues are back home sooner than later,” Singh said.He added that a healthy and nutritious diet was essential during the COVID-19 treatment as it boosted immunity and supplemented energy.“The doctors only give you regular medicines. They took very good care of us. But a good diet is very essential,” he said.The head constable, who hails from Jhajjar in Haryana, said he found that the people who have a “spirited frame of mind and are enthusiastic to get well soon” were discharged soon from the hospital.Singh says his samples were taken five times during the treatment period and the last three came negative after which he was discharged.The jawan also praises his force commanders, especially his neighbours, who took care of his son and wife when he was admitted in the hospital.

This is unlike other devices which are timer based and dispense a fixed quantity of sanitizer.​The machine was demonstrated by the TBRL on Monday before two senior doctors at the PGIMER here who are handling COVID-19 patients.According to one of the doctors, the machine generates high pressure droplets that are able to enter the skin pores and penetrate under the nail tips.The pressurised mist is able to cleanse even minute areas. The quick response of the sensor not only ensures timely delivery of sanitizing mist but also reduces any wastage, the doctor added.Two models with a capacity of two litres and five litres have been designed, which are expected to cost Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 per unit and commercial production is expected to commence soon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fight-against-covid-tbrl-develops-contactless-sanitizer-dispenser-83455

The incident happened after a person in an inebriated state entered a place of worship and attacked five people offering prayers.According to the police, following the incident in the Shivajinagar area, two groups hurled stones at each other. Few people were injured in the stone pelting while three houses and two vehicles were damaged. Bhaunsa is a major trading centre.Keeping the COVID-19 situation in mind and to avoid people coming together, the police immediately imposed a 24-hour curfew and intensified patrolling across the town to prevent further clashes. About 15 people were detained in connection with the clash.Superintendent of Police C Shashidhar Raju said the situation was now under control. "We have deployed more forces and closely monitoring the situation," he said.Telangana Home Minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali, meanwhile, termed the incident as “minor” and said his government was looking into the “stone pelting” between two sections of people.The minister said he had spoken to the SP over phone and instructed him to take all effective steps.Mahmood Ali said that immediate action had been taken by the police and normalcy was ensured in the area.“Situation is under complete control,” said Mahmood Ali.He also urged people not to believe or spread rumours.The minister said, “People of Telangana always maintained brotherhood and strongly believe in Ganga-Jamuna tehzib.”Karimnagar range in-charge DIG P Pramod Kumar also visited the town on Monday and reviewed the situation.

11-05-2020||Ajay Banerjee||India holding existing positions along LAC; it’s not a ‘forward policy’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 11Each time troops of the Indian Army and Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) China clash along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) or are locked in a stand-off, questions are raised about ‘aggressive behaviour’ by either side in the past few years.Often commentators dwell upon India following a ‘forward policy’ or is China expanding to capture Ladakh, which it counts as one of the ‘five fingers’ of Tibet.These counter strategic moves are of the 1950s and 1960s. Things have changed since 1993 --- the timeline, incidentally, coincides with the economic rise of the India and China – a series of treaties, coupled with diplomacy and political directives maintain peace. The last such directive emerged from the Modi-Xi meeting at Wuhan which listed out a clear strategy to maintain peace.On the night of May 5 and 6, Indian and Chinese troops clashed yet again in Ladakh, the second such clash in three years, besides at least six major stands-offs in the area since 2013, high-level meetings have been conducted to reduce tensions.In the past decade or so, the Indian stance along the LAC, is not akin to Jawaharlal Nehru’s 1960-1961 “forward policy”. It only looks to hold claim lines along the LAC, a 3,488-km defacto boundary; 826 km of this is in Ladakh.The “forward policy”, as explained by Neville Maxwell in his book “India’s China war”, entailed taking up permanent positions along the high ridgelines of eastern Ladakh as per India’s unilaterally decided boundary of 1954.‘Five fingers’ of Tibet is what is India’s apprehension. China’s undeclared policy was made public to the outside world in early 1950s. Mao Tseung, the first Chairman cum President of China, declared Tibet to be ‘the palm of China’ whereas Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and North East Frontier Association (NEFA, modern Indian province of Arunachal Pradesh) are its five fingers and said it is China’s responsibility to ‘liberate’ them all.India, in the past 15 years or so, has ‘militarily tailored’ its responses along 3488-km LAC, or the defacto boundary, by building infrastructure and acquiring military equipment to respond, if needed.Undemarcated LAC is outcome of the ‘great game’, live with itThat the boundary between India and China is vexed and is not expected to be solved soon, is a reality both countries have realised. The Special Representatives on the boundary question, India is represented by National security Adviser, have held more than 20 rounds of talks.The two Asian giants, both nuclear armed, and now leading economies, need to break away from a boundary dispute, dictated by British polices of 150-200 years ago and was the outcome of fluctuations of the British ‘forward policy’.Ladakh was captured in 1834 by Sikh-ruler Ranjit Singh’s Army and incorporated into Jammu and Kashmir in 1846 by the British. Between 1846 and 1947, fluctuations of the British foreign policy reacting to Russian pressure held back the demarcation. Even when China sided with the British during World War I (1914-1918) the boundary question was never sorted. For almost a hundred years commencing 1815, Britain—then ruling India—and Czarist Russia expanded their respective Empires. Historians describe this as the ‘Great Game’. Treaties were inked between the two to create buffer zones.Undecided boundaries that have been shifted several times have led to confusion. Today India and China have claims and counter claims which result in varying perception of the LAC. It all boils down to the perception of either side. Troops of both sides patrol the areas that they perceive as their own.These variations in LAC have led to the India and China war in 1962. The two have had an armed skirmish in 1967 at Nathu La, had an eight-month long stand-off at Sumdrong Chu in north-western Arunachal Pradesh in 1986 and the 73-day stand-off at Doklam in 2017.The British boundaries — five separate ones proposed in 1846, 1865, 1873, 1899 and 1914, which China never accepted — have no bearing on the present day situation. LAC partially adheres to one of the British-era boundaries, no more. Post 1947, there has been a proposal each from China and India but nothing happened. China proposal of 1960 to demarcate a boundary on present ‘day actualities’ was turned down by India. “Accepting that would have compromised territorial integrity,” says a book ‘History of the Conflict with China. 1962’, produced by the History Division of Ministry of Defence, and released for restricted circulation in March 1993.As result several core disputes remain along the LAC as perception of its exact location on ground varies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-holding-existing-positions-along-lac-its-not-a-forward-policy-83445

11-05-2020||Beijing||Sino-India border clashes: China says its troops committed to uphold peace||China, on Monday, reacted guardedly to the recent clashes between the Chinese and the Indian soldiers, saying its troops remained “committed to uphold peace and tranquillity” at the border areas.Answering questions on the clashes near the Naku La Pass in the Sikkim sector, which resulted in injuries to both sides, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the most pressing issue for the world at present was the fight against COVID-19.“Since the outbreak of COVID-19, China and India have been staying in close communication and cooperation on prevention and control to jointly meet challenges,” he said.“Now the most pressing issue for the international community is solidarity and cooperation against COVID-19. We shouldn’t allow any politicisation or stigmatisation in a bid to create more differences or confrontation,” he said.Asked whether the clashes which took place on May 5-6 anyway reflects an aggressive approach by China post the COVID-19 outbreak, Zhao said, “relevant assumption is groundless”.“As to the China-India border issue, our position is clear and consistent,” he said. “Our troops there are committed to uphold peace and stability. This serves the common interests of our two countries and two peoples. We hope India will work with China to uphold peace and tranquillity in the border regions with concrete actions,” he said.Zhao cautiously skirted any direct reference to the incident nor gave any details of the clashes.“Chinese border troops have always been upholding peace and tranquillity along our border areas. China and India stay in close communication and coordination concerning our border affairs with existing channels,” he said.“This year marks the 70th year of the establishment of diplomatic relations between India and China, and the two countries have joined hands to fight against COVID-19,” he said.“Under such circumstances, both sides should work together with each other and properly manage and handle the differences and earnestly uphold peace and stability in the border region so as to create enabling conditions for our bilateral relations as well as the joint fight against COVID-19,” he said.Troops of India and China were engaged in two fierce face-offs in Eastern Ladakh and near Naku La Pass in Northern Sikkim recently, leaving several soldiers on both sides injured.In the first incident, scores of Indian and Chinese army personnel clashed along the northern bank of the Pangong Lake in Eastern Ladakh on the late evening of May 5 and the face-off ended next morning following dialogue between the two sides.A number of soldiers on both sides sustained minor injuries as they exchanged punches and resorted to stone-pelting, the sources said, adding around 200 personnel were involved in the face-off. Both sides brought in additional troops following the fracas.It was the first case of troops from both sides exchanging blows after a similar incident had taken place around the Pangong Lake in August 2017.In a separate incident, nearly 150 Indian and Chinese military personnel were engaged in a face-off near Naku La Pass in the Sikkim sector of the Sino-India border in which at least 10 soldiers sustained injuries.The troops of India and China were engaged in a 73-day stand-off in Doklam tri-junction in 2017, which triggered fears of a war between the two neighbours.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control, the de-facto border between the two countries.Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it was necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China’s President Xi Jinping held their first informal summit in April 2018 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, months after the Doklam standoff.During the summit, the two leaders decided to issue “strategic guidance” to their militaries to strengthen communications so that they can build trust and understanding.Modi and Xi held their second informal summit in Mamallapuram near Chennai in October last year with a focus on further broadening the bilateral ties.

11-05-2020||New Delhi||Some relatively large COVID-19 outbreaks noticed in particular locations: Health Ministry||As India registered a record jump of 4,213 COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, the government, on Monday, said some relatively large outbreaks had been noticed in particular locations and it was important to focus on containment efforts to ensure that the country does not reach the community transmission stage.The government also said the COVID-19 tracking app, Aarogya Setu, was secure as it had been designed keeping in mind the privacy of people and was playing a crucial role in India’s fight against COVID-19.Asked if there has been a community transmission of the disease, the Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry Lav, Agarwal, at a press briefing said: “Some clusters have been found here (in the country), and in some cases in some particular locations relatively large outbreaks have also been noticed.”“And in this context, if you remember even AIIMS Director (Dr Randeep Guleria) had said that if these are not contained properly, the transmission rate would become higher. So, it is important for us now to focus on containment efforts and ensure that we do not reach the stage of community transmission,” he said.Agarwal said 4,213 COVID-19 cases and 97 deaths had been reported in last 24 hrs till Monday 8 am, taking the total cases to 67,152 and death toll to 2,206.As many as 20,917 COVID-19 patients have been cured to date, taking the recovery rate to 31.15 per cent. Also 1,559 patients have recovered in the past 24 hours, the highest number of recoveries recorded in one day.Ajay Sawhney, chairman of Empowered Group 9, which deals with technology and data management, said the mobile application had been developed in order to alert people before they came in contact with infected patients and to alert the health system to take adequate steps for their help.The Aarogya Setu mobile app had contributed significantly in India’s fight against COVID-19, he said, adding that the app had been designed keeping in mind the privacy of people.Around 9.8 crore people had downloaded the app and it was available in 12 languages, Sawhney said.Information about 697 potential COVID-19 hotspots was generated through the Aarogya Setu app, he said, asserting that the application was secure, is used only for health interventions, and did not reveal the identity of people.Around 1.4 lakh Aarogya Setu app users had been alerted via Bluetooth contact tracing about the possible risk of infection due to proximity to infected patients, Sawhney said.The Aarogya Setu app would soon reach a user base of 10 crore and it had created a world record in being the fastest app to reach five crore users, he said.When asked about certain media reports claiming that government was mulling religion-based mapping of hotspots, Agarwal said it was a very irresponsible, baseless and incorrect news. The spread of COVID-19 had nothing to do with race, religion, area and it spread due to lack of precautions, he asserted.Agarwal said people having COVID-19 symptoms should not hide them and come forward to report so that they didn’t spread the infection to others.

We have already ferried several thousand people since Sunday," said Shekhar Channe, Managing Director, Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation.According to Channe, the ST buses drop people at the state's borders and pick up people from Maharashtra returning home from the neighbouring states.State Transport Minister Anil Parab said here on Monday that the police have been instructed not to beat up migrants walking home by road. "Police have been told to let migrants walk home. They need not walk on train tracks and risk their lives," said Parab.The minister also said there were many people who were keen on returning to their villages within Maharashtra. "Those who want to go from one city to another or to another district should form groups of 22 people. The group leader should collect the details, including mobile phone numbers, of all the members and approach the local police station for arranging transportation," said Parab.The minister further said buses would be arranged if there were enough people travelling to a particular destination.On reaching their home towns the migrants will have to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days, the minister informed.According to the state police, large numbers of migrants are stranded in all the major cities of the state like Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad and Nagpur.Even though nearly 25,000 industrial units restarted operations in Maharashtra from Monday, a large number of migrants from north India have chosen to return home, according to the Home Department officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-rolls-out-buses-for-migrants-walking-home-83431
11-05-2020||Saurabh Malik||Centre allows opening of all private hospitals||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 11The Centre has allowed the opening of all private hospitals and asked all states and UTs to ensure smooth movement of medical professionals, nurses, paramedical staff, sanitation personnel and ambulances. They have also been asked to ensure the opening of all private clinics, nursing homes and laboratories with all medical professional and staff.As a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking improvement in healthcare facilities and assistance to people during the COVID-induced lockdown period came up for hearing, Additional Solicitor-General of India Satya Pal Jain told the Punjab and Haryana High Court that such movement would also be facilitated inter-state, wherever required.The counsel for the state of Punjab said necessary instructions had already been submitted to the government and private hospitals to provide requisite treatment even to non-COVID patients, and the instructions had already been implemented.Jain informed the Bench of Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli that restrictions imposed by some of the states and the UTs on the movement of medical professionals and paramedical personnel was discussed in a meeting chaired by the Union Cabinet Secretary on May 10.The decisions taken were, subsequently, conveyed to the Chief Secretaries of all states and the UTs through a circular issued by the Union Home Secretary.Jain added that the letter by the Home Secretary made it clear that any restrictions on the movements of medical professions and paramedical staff could lead to sever constraints in rendering medical services to COVID and non- COVID patients.Jain said it had come to the government’s notice that private clinics and nursing homes at many places were reportedly not allowed to open, though the functioning of these medical facilities was crucial as these were supplementing regular medical infrastructure and relieving the burden on the hospitals.The petition in the public interest was filed by advocate Ferry Sofat against the Union of India and other respondents. His contention was that government and private hospitals in the state of Punjab were equipped to treat the COVID-infected patients, but the patients suffering from other serious ailments were not being extended necessary healthcare facilities and medical assistance.The Bench asserted the assertions in the writ petition have been denied. “Satya Pal Jain, Additional Solicitor-General of India, informed us during the hearing that Government of India and the Ministry of Home Affairs have issued fresh instructions on the matter in issue on Monday, which the state government shall have to follow/abide by,” the Bench added, while permitting the petitioner to withdraw the petition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-allows-opening-of-all-private-hospitals-83428

11-05-2020||Pune||Pune positive: As work resumes, 380 migrants skip 2 trains||Three hundred migrant labourers with permission to board a Shramik Special train from Pune to Madhya Pradesh did not report at departure on Sunday, and 80 for a train to Uttarakhand on Monday, with local officials claiming these were “positive” signs due to the reopening of several industries in the region.An official said 1,172 people had got permission to travel on the train to MP but 300, mostly working in the MIDC area here, did not turn up when it left from Daund station.“These people have claimed they chose not to move as they were getting work in MIDC areas here. The firms there also know they will suffer if workers move so may have offered incentives,” said Daund Tehsildar Sanjay Patil.He said a train which left for Uttarakhand on Monday also had 80 absentees, with all of them claiming there was no need to go back to their native villages as work had started here.Pune District Collector Naval Kishore Ram said, “This is actually a positive sign. Opening industries in MIDC areas and giving permission for construction work in non-containment areas have created a positive atmosphere among labourers. That is why they are preferring to stay back.”  Patil said officials had to call up those on the “waitlist” to ensure the trains did not leave below sanctioned capacity.Jwala Prasad, one of the 300 who gave the MP train a miss, said he did not move as the plant in Kurmukh MIDC where he worked as an operator had resumed operations.“I have been living here with my wife and two children for 10 years. We even filed forms to board the Shramik Special but then dropped the plan as work at my company resumed,” he said.

11-05-2020||London||Nirav Modi's 5-day extradition trial in PNB fraud case begins in UK||Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, fighting extradition to India on charges over the nearly USD 2 billion PNB fraud and money laundering case, appeared via video-link before a UK court on the first day of his five-day extradition trial on Monday, taking place in a part-remote setting due to the coronavirus lockdown.The 49-year-old jeweller, who has been lodged at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest in March last year, joined the proceedings via the court's common viewing platform (CVP) at the Westminster Magistrates' Court in London dressed formally in a white shirt and black blazer.The hearing got off to a delayed start as officials sorted out technical difficulties of connecting the court room to the prison.Given the social distancing measures being followed by prisons and courts, District Judge Samuel Goozee had conceded that Modi can follow the proceedings via video-link rather than the norm of being produced in person."It is important that if you have any difficulty with the audio or visual of the proceedings at any time, to let us know immediately,” Judge Goozee told Modi, so that he can follow the court proceedings in an open way as per the law.A handful of legal representatives were present in the court room, as previously agreed, with witnesses set to give their evidence via video-link.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), appearing on behalf of the Indian authorities, began by laying out the basis of the Indian government's case. CPS barrister Helen Malcolm appeared via video-link to tell the court that Modi acquired “eye watering amounts of money” fraudulently from Punjab National Bank (PNB).“There is really nothing very complicated about this case. It covers three aspects - the fraud, then laundering of that fraud money and the rotation of goods around the Modi empire,” she said.The five-day hearing which started on Monday relates to the Indian government's extradition request certified by the UK government last year.The case has been filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and relates to a large-scale fraud upon an Indian PSU through the fraudulent obtaining of letters of understanding (LoUs) and the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.Two additional charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death” were added on by the CBI and certified earlier this year.CPS barrister Nick Hearn, the co-counsel in the case, told the court at the last hearing in April, held via tele-conference, that the government of India's representatives would be following the proceedings and giving instructions via the court's online common viewing platform, given the COVID-19 related travel restrictions.“We have received comprehensive responses in writing from the Government of India, which would reduce the likely length of cross-examinations,” said Hearn.It was also confirmed that the diamond merchant would not be giving evidence in the case, but his legal team plans to produce around six witnesses, including a jewellery expert as well as judicial and prisons experts.Most of the legal cases in the UK have incorporated video-link and telephonic options where possible amid the social distancing rules in place to combat the coronavirus pandemic.Modi, whose Wandsworth Prison is considered one of the most over-crowded in England, had made a fifth attempt at bail in the High Court last month, which was rejected as the judge ruled that he continued to pose a flight risk.The jeweller was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard on charges of fraud and money laundering brought by the Indian government.

11-05-2020||New Delhi||Commendable that India has been able to keep COVID-19 cases very low: WHO’s chief scientist||World Health Organisation’s Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan on Monday commended India for keeping the coronavirus cases and deaths very low compared to other countries and said it will play an important role in the development of a vaccine for COVID-19.She said the whole world has to be prepared for the ongoing transmission of infection for “many many months and for perhaps years to come”.Swaminathan said it is not just enough to develop and test the vaccine, but it is also crucial to manufacture it, scale-up procurement and get health systems to vaccinate populations.Speaking on the National Technology Day, Swaminathan said, “I would like to commend and congratulate the minister and colleagues for having contained so far the COVID-19 pandemic in India and having kept both the number of cases and the number of deaths very low compared to other countries.”All participants, including Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan, addressed the conference online.“However, we know it is the marathon that we are running. It is not the sprint and India and in fact the whole world has to be prepared for the ongoing transmission of infection for many, many months and for perhaps years to come,” she said.According to the World Health Organisation, as on Monday there have been 39,76,043 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 2,77,708 deaths.In India, the death toll due to COVID-19 stands at 2,206. The number of cases is 67,152 in the country.Swaminathan, who served as Director General of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said there are many challenges in India in terms of over-population, over-crowding in many of the urban areas and poor access to healthcare facilities in some of the rural areas.“This is the time, actually, for us to strengthen public health surveillance, primary health care delivery, and strengthening of the health workforce,” she said.On vaccine development, Swaminathan said many vaccine candidates are being developed in India, some in partnership with other groups and some on their own.“India will play an important role in vaccine development. The world cannot have enough vaccines for everyone if India is not part of the process,” she said.It usually takes 10 years to develop a vaccine, but in the case of Ebola, it was done in five years.“The aim is to get a (coronavirus) vaccine out in a year or so. Or even less if possible,” she said, adding that the process of developing vaccine will need global collaboration like sharing of knowledge, resources, tools and pooling of ideas to perform clinical trials more effectively.“I am very optimistic that some of these will be successful,” she said.She added that the most vulnerable people to whom the vaccines should be first administered must be identified. This includes frontline workers and people with co-morbidities.Prioritisation framework needs to be developed, she added.

11-05-2020||New Delhi||PM appreciates states' roles in helping contain spread of COVID-19||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday appreciated the state governments’ roles in helping slow the spread of coronavirus.Modi, who addressed chief ministers of various states to review measures taken and also strategise the next move, said: “The entire world feels India has been able to successfully protect itself from COVID-19. States played major role in this”.He said the country needed to devise and implement a balanced strategy for the road ahead.“We will be able to determine the direction our country is headed based on suggestions you provide today,” he said.He said the biggest challenge would be to ensure there is no spread of COVID-19 to villages in the country as lockdown is gradually eased.“It was essential to make best efforts to ensure that people stay where they were during the lockdown, the prime minister said. However, in times like these people wish to go home and therefore, a change in decision had to be made,” he said.Social distancing, he said, was the key.“Wherever we have not followed social distancing, our problems have increased,” he said.Large-scale movement of migrant workers from urban to rural India and the problems their return to home states may cause in restarting the economy was also being discussed during the fifth virtual interaction between the prime minister and chief ministers since the outbreak of the deadly virus in the country.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Home Minister Amit Shah, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, among others, attended the interaction.Chief Ministers YS Jagan Mohan Reddy (Andhra Pradesh), Amarinder Singh (Punjab), Nitish Kumar (Bihar), Adityanath (Uttar Pradesh) and Pema Khandu (Arunachal Pradesh) were also among those who attended the virtual conference.Also read Punjab CM pitches for continued lockdown with well-crafted exit strategyThe development comes after India reported 4,213 coronavirus cases within a span of 24 hours---the highest single-day rise of infection that took the country’s COVID-19 tally to 67,152.Also, 98 more deaths reported in the same span took the country’s death toll from COVID-19 to 2,201.The meeting comes less than a month after the last interaction the prime minister had with the chief ministers on April 27.  The prime minister interacted with the chief ministers last on April 27. Days after the meeting, the central government had extended the lockdown by two more weeks till May 17 to arrest the spread of the virus, but gave several relaxations in economic activities and movement of people.Some of the CMs had complained after that meeting that they were not allowed to put forth their views.At a meeting on Sunday with Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, state chief secretaries told him that "while protection is required from COVID-19, economic activities also need to be stepped up in a calibrated manner", according to an official statement.With thousands of migrant workers taking special trains to go back to their home states, the restarting of industrial activities will prove to be a challenge for states though several relaxations have been made in labour laws to increase factory output.A nationwide lockdown has been in force since March 25 to contain the spread of the virus.

11-05-2020||New Delhi||Ayurvedic drug ‘fifatrol’ can be useful in fighting coronavirus||Fifatrol as an immunity-boosting ayurvedic drug has found a mention among nearly 200 technologies and research activities evaluated by experts in a recently released compendium for combating coronavirus.Compiled by the state-run National Research Development Corporation, the 'Compendium of Indian Technologies for Combating COVID-19 (Tracing, Testing &Treating)' provides the status of 200 indigenously developed technologies and ongoing research activities and efforts taken by the government to combat the deadly viral infection.Health experts have suggested that boosting the body's immune system may help minimise the effects and hasten the recovery from the disease, the compendium stated.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, recently highlighted the benefits of ayurveda and urged people to have a look at AYUSH Ministry's protocol to stay fit, saying good health is the harbinger of happiness. "Fifatrol acts as an immunity enhancer which is a multi-drug combination of ayurvedic classical medicines and herbs. Researchers have suggested that fifatrol acts as a natural antibiotic and fights infection, flu and ache," stated the compendium.Elaborating the salient features of the drug, the compendium stated that fifatrol was a natural formulation providing fast relief from nasal congestion, sore throat, body ache and headache. "It is enriched with scientifically validated botanical extracts and micro-nutrients. It is a rational combination of vital phytoconstituents, immunomodulators and antioxidants which justifies its beneficial effect for the treatment of viral upper respiratory infections," it said.Fifatrol, developed by the AIMIL Pharma, is a formulation of well-known immunity enhancer herbs like guduchi, sanjeevini ghanvati, daruharidra, apamarga, chirayata, karanja, kutaki, tulsi, godanti (bhasam), mrtyunjaya rasa, tribhuvana kriti rasa and sanjivani vati. The drug offers improved immune system in top notch form to fight off viral, bacterial and other infections. Normalises raised body temperature, fastens recovery and eases the associated symptoms like flu, cold and congestion, the compendium stated. The Prime Minister had urged AYUSH practitioners to pitch in to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. He has also been exhorting the citizens to fall back on traditional home remedies to boost their immunity amid the outbreak.

However, the reach so far has been limited to mostly non-perishable produce. Inter-state transactions also remain an issue.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said efforts should be made to strengthen e-NAM further to benefit farmers.According to Sandip Das from the Indian Council for Research in International Economic Relations (ICRI): “When inter-state trade is facilitated across all mandis through e-NAM platform, farmers get the benefit of the price discovery mechanism. Traders and buyers will have to be provided with a single license to conduct trade across the mandis in a state. With so many mandis coming on board, the government should ensure seamless trading of agricultural commodities across states.”According to officials, the 785 mandis integrated with e-NAM across 17 states and two Union Territories has a user base of 1.66 crore farmers, 1.30 lakh traders and 71,911 commission agents.As on May 9, as many as 3.43 crore MT and 37.93 lakh (bamboo and coconut), collectively worth more than Rs 1 lakh crore has been traded on the platform, and digital payment worth Rs 708 crore made, benefiting more than 1.25 lakh farmers.As many as 236 mandis also participated in an inter-mandi trade across 12 states while 13 states/UTs participated in the inter-state trade, allowing farmers to interact directly with distantly located traders, they said.Currently, 150 agri-commodities, including food grains, oilseeds, fibres, vegetables and fruits, are being traded on e-NAM, with around 1,005 registered FPOs trading 2,900 MT of agri-produce worth Rs 7.92 crore.E-NAM, which aims to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities to promote uniformity in marketing by streamlining procedures, removing information asymmetry between buyers and sellers and promoting real-time price discovery based on actual demand and supply, remains the key focus of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to strengthen the sector amid the Covid-19 crisis, say officials.Launched on April 14, 2016, the aim in the COVID-19 scenario is to develop the portal into a bigger platform to transform the trading of all farm-related commodities including seeds, fertilisers and agro-chemical plant protection inputs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/increasing-e-nam-footprint-177-new-mandis-in-10-states-integrated-with-online-portal-83414
11-05-2020||---||Nepal summons Indian envoy on road to Kailash Mansarovar||New Delhi, May 11In a rare occurrence, Nepal on Monday summoned the Indian Ambassador in Kathmandu Vinay Mohan Kwatra and handed over a diplomatic note on the boundary issue after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a road to Kailash Mansarovar last week.Nepal claims the road traverses Lipu Lekh over which it lays claim but the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson here suggested that a path already being used by pilgrims was black-topped to benefit a wider cross-section of society, including traders and locals.Pressure had mounted on the Nepal Government after its MPs called for action after news broke about Singh inaugurating the road. Nepal Communist Party's Co-Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, locked in a power tussle with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, urged Nepal to go beyond diplomatic means in settling the border dispute.Nepal played down the summoning which was described as a “meeting” and it chose to record its divergence with the Indian stand, not by a “protest note” or “demarche” but through a diplomatic note. In its initial reaction on Saturday too, Nepal was conciliatory by suggesting talks between Foreign Secretaries Harsh Vardhan Shringla and Shankar Das Bairagi.Nepal had in 2015 protested to both India and China by diplomatic notes when both sides had signed the agreement to expand trade via the Lipu Lekh route which in effect made the strengthening of the road a fait accompli.Nepal claims that the Sugauli Treaty of 1816 grants it all territory to the east of the Kali river but there are three problematic patches of land, one of which is Lipu Lekh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-summons-indian-envoy-on-road-to-kailash-mansarovar-83413

There is no need for testing after the home isolation period is over," the revised guidelines stated.This is in line with the new discharge policy for COVID-19 cases released on May 9 by the health ministry stating coronavirus-infected patients developing severe illness or having compromised immunity will only have to test negative through RT-PCR test after resolution of symptoms before they are discharged by a hospital.Moderate cases of COVID-19 and pre-symptomatic, mild and very mild cases need not undergo tests before being discharged after the resolution of symptoms.Besides, the guidelines reiterated that the caregiver and all close contacts of such cases should take hydroxychloroquine as a preventive medication, according to the protocol and as prescribed by the treating medical officer. Also, a caregiver should be available to provide care on a 24x7 basis. A communication link between the caregiver and hospital is a prerequisite for the entire duration of home isolation.Besides, the guidelines call for downloading the Arogya Setu app on mobile and it should remain active at all times (through bluetooth and Wi-Fi).Immediate medical attention must be sought if serious signs or symptoms, including difficulty in breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, mental confusion, developing bluish discolorations of lips/face develop.The patient also has to give an undertaking stating being diagnosed as a confirmed/suspect case of COVID-19, he/she has voluntarily undertaken to maintain strict self-isolation at all times for the prescribed period.The undertaking also states that the patient is liable to be acted on under the prescribed law for any non-adherence to self-isolation protocol.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 2,206 and the number of cases climbed to 67,152 on Monday, according to the Union Health Ministry.

They have a problem with the government (Centre) and they want to teach this journalist (Arnab) a lesson,” Salve told the Bench.He sought transfer of cases against Goswami to the CBI, saying there was a political problem between Maharashtra and the Centre.“I have been caught in crossfire,” Arnab Goswami said.Salve said interrogation of his client was done during the lockdown. “Our apprehensions have turned out to be true. Two officers, who interrogated him, were asymptomatic and now one has tested COVID-19 positive.”Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta said: “This is the first case where the police come and say please insulate us as we are under pressure; and the accused says I don’t have faith in the police.”Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing Maharashtra government, accused Goswami of sensationalising and stigmatising people.During the hearing, the Supreme Court told Salve: “If you want quashing of the FIRs, then you can move the high court. We had earlier intervened due to multiplicity of the FIRs arising out of same cause of action.”Arnab Goswami had, on May 5, moved the Supreme Court seeking quashing of a fresh FIR registered against him by the secretary of the Raza Educational Welfare Society, Irfan Abubakar Shaikh, accusing him of disturbing communal harmony through his Hindi show on Republic Bharat by allegedly communalising the April 14 incident at the Bandra railway station.Arnab Goswami is also facing probe in another case registered against him at Nagpur and transferred to Mumbai in connection with his alleged remarks against Congress president Sonia Gandhi during his shows on Republic TV on mob-lynching of two Hindu saints in Palghar, Maharashtra.The Supreme Court had, on April 24, stayed all coercive action against Goswami for three weeks in connection with multiple FIRs by Congress workers, but had allowed probe into the Nagpur FIR.Last week, the Maharashtra government had alleged before the Supreme Court that Goswami was attempting to “browbeat” the Mumbai police by “creating a fear psychosis”.It had also accused Goswami of abusing the protection from coercive action given by the Court and urged it to issue directions to insulate the probe agency from any pressure, threat or coercion from Goswami and to enable it to carry out its lawful obligations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arnab-alleges-vendetta-sc-reserves-order-on-his-pleas-for-quashing-of-firs-83403

11-05-2020||New Delhi||ICMR issues guidance for appropriate recording of Covid-19 deaths to create robust data||Covid-19 would be recorded as an "underlying cause of death" when leading to pneumonia, cardiac injury and clotting in the bloodstream, among others, according to the guidance issued by the ICMR for appropriate recording of deaths due to the disease in India.Explaining the public health significance of recording the cause of death in the Covid-19 pandemic, the ICMR said Covid-19 is a new disease and is a pandemic affecting all communities and countries and a robust data is needed in India to measure the public health impact of the ailment and to plan for timely health interventions.In its guidance for appropriate recording of Covid-19 deaths in India, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said deaths with inconclusive test results, but in which coronavirus symptoms are present, would be recorded as "probable Covid-19" fatalities.Deaths in which tests are awaited with the presence of symptoms will be recorded as suspected deaths, while those testing negative but have symptoms will be mentioned as clinically-epidemiologically diagnosed Covid-19, the guidance stated.Its clinical presentation ranges from mild to severe, and fatality depends on the severity of the illness, associated co-morbid conditions and age of patients."Patterns of disease and patterns of death can come from only standardised recording of clinical disease history and cause of death, and therefore epidemiological surveillance of disease and death are important."Robust data is needed from every district and state in India to measure the public health impact of COVID-19 and to plan for timely health interventions and protect communities."At the same time, other health conditions affecting populations need to be also monitored so that the health system is prepared for responding to the needs of the population,"' the document stated.It lists forms where a health facility or a medical practitioner has to mention the sequence of events leading to death, which includes the immediate cause of death, cause of death antecedent to immediate cause, underlying cause of death and the manner of death, among others.It is likely that COVID-19 is the underlying cause of death (UCOD) that leads to pneumonia in most of the deaths due to COVID-19.Patients may present with other pre-existing co-morbid conditions such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, ischemic heart disease, cancer and diabetes mellitus. These conditions increase the risk of developing respiratory infections, and may lead to complications and severe disease in a COVID-19 positive patient."These conditions are not considered as underlying cause of death as they have not directly caused death due to COVID-19. Also, a patient may has many co-morbid conditions but only those that have contributed to death should be recorded," the guidance document stated.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 2,206 and the number of cases climbed to 67,152 in the country on Monday, registering an increase of 97 deaths and a record jump of 4,213 cases in the last 24 hours, according to the Union health ministry.The health research body also outlines the use of ICMR-NCDIR e-Mortality (e-Mor) software for recording the cause of death.The ICMR-NCDIR e-Mortality (e-Mor) software app aids in recording and reporting the cause of deaths as per the national standards of death reporting laid down by the Office of the Registrar General of India.This software can be implemented by hospitals and district local registrar offices in a district (to record deaths occurring in residence). Institutions should register with ICMR-NCDIR or state authority for provision of authorised login credentials, the document stated.

11-05-2020||---||SC refuses to order restoration of 4G services in J&K||New Delhi, May 11The Supreme Court, on Monday, refused to order the restoration of 4G mobile internet services in Jammu and Kashmir, but set up a special committee, led by the Union Home Secretary to take a call on the issue after factoring in the security situation on the ground.Besides the Union Home Secretary, the Secretary of the Department of Telecommunication Secretary and Chief Secretary of J&K will be part of the panel, a three-judge Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana ordered.“...since the issues involved affect the State, and the nation, the Review Committee (under Telecom Rules), which consists of only state-level officers, may not be in a position to satisfactorily address all issues raised,” it said justifying the setting up of the special committee.“We do recognise that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir has been plagued with militancy, which is required to be taken into consideration. These competing considerations need to calibrated in terms of our judgment (on the lockdown in J&K) in Anuradha Bhasin (case),” said the Bench which had reserved its judgement on May 4.The Bench said: “It must be noted that the authorities have been taking steps towards easing of internet restrictions taking into account the prevailing circumstances.”Internet speed has been restricted in Jammu and Kashmir for several months. The last order was issued on April 27 extending the restrictions till May 11.Three petitioners, including the Foundation for Media Professionals and Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir, had challenged the orders restricting the internet speed.They had contended that 2G internet speed was not enough for access to online education and healthcare services during the COVID-19 lockdown.The restrictions violated citizens’ Right to Education and the Right to Health, which were part of the Right to Life and Liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, and went against the SC verdict in Anuradha Basin case that provided for safeguards against misuse of powers under the Telecom Rules, they argued.“Although the present orders indicate that they have been passed for a limited period of time, the order does not provide any reasons to reflect that all the districts of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir require the imposition of such restrictions,” the top court noted.It said the special committee must also examine the appropriateness of the alternatives suggested by the petitioners regarding limiting the restrictions to those areas where it was necessary and the allowing faster internet (3G or 4G) on a trial basis over certain geographical areas and advise the government on the issue in terms of its directions in Bhasin’s case.Citing a recent encounter in which five security personnel, including a Colonel, were killed in Kashmir, the J&K administration had opposed the petitions, contending restoration of 4G internet services will lead to a further surge in terror activities.Faster 4G internet speed would give the enemy information even about troop movements, Attorney General KK Venugopal had submitted.Earlier, in an affidavit filed in response to these petitions, the J&K administration had said reasonable restrictions were unavoidable given peculiar geopolitical situation.Asserting that right to access the internet was not a fundamental right, the UT administration asserted it could be curtailed in the interest of the “sovereignty”, “security” and “integrity” of India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-order-restoration-of-4g-services-in-jk-83385
11-05-2020||New Delhi/Mumbai||100 Shramik trains to run daily; Centre asks states to assist migrants trudging back||The Centre, on Monday, decided to run 100 special trains daily for migrants during the COVID-19 lockdown and asked the states to ensure that they availed the facility, as lakhs of stranded people were trekking or cycling for hundreds of kilometres, or cramming into trucks, autos and other vehicles for an arduous journey home.The Maharashtra government, too, announced the launch of free bus services up to the borders of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat for migrant labourers, days after 16 workers, who were walking back home to MP, were mowed down by a goods train in Aurangabad after they fell asleep on railway tracks.An official said on Monday that the Railways would now run 100 Shramik Special trains daily, adding that 468 such trains had been operated since May 1, ferrying home over five lakh migrants stranded in various parts of the country.The Railways also decided to carry around 1,700 passengers on board these trains instead of the current 1,200. The railway zones have also been asked to provide three stops in the destination state other than the terminating station, at the request of the state governments.The Central Government has noted with great concern that migrant workers continue to walk on roads and railway tracks, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said in a letter to Chief Secretaries of all states and Union Territories and asked them to ensure that such people were provided shelter and food till they were facilitated to board the special trains or buses to their native places.The opposition has been critical of the Centre’s handling of the situation, accusing it of not doing enough to ease the hardships of the migrant workers, many of whom have lost their jobs during the lockdown which started on March 25.These people have been desperate to reach their native places, but with public transport suspended and movement restricted, many have resorted to walking or using whatever private vehicles are available, facing immense hardships and even risking their lives. Accidents involving migrants on the move are being reported daily from various states.Returning home to Uttar Pradesh from Telangana, two migrant labourers were killed and seven others injured after a truck they had hitched a ride on to take a break from walking overturned in Gorakhpur district in UP on Monday, police said.According to reports, all nine labourers are residents of Maharajganj district. They were returning from Hyderabad on foot and took a lift in the truck, which was transporting sand, in Kanpur.In another incident, a migrant worker cycling back to his native place in Bihar from Delhi died after being run over by a car in Lucknow on Saturday, they said.At least six migrant labourers, who were returning to Uttar Pradesh from Hyderabad, were killed and 14 others injured when a truck in which they were travelling overturned in Narsinghpur district, Madhya Pradesh, on Saturday night.Since the Shramik Special train service started, Gujarat has remained one of the top originating stations, followed by Kerala, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh topping the list of receiving states. Yet many migrant labourers have not been able to avail the facility.There have also been apprehensions about a shortage of labour, difficulties in rehabilitating returnees and fear of a rise in COVID-19 cases due to the movement of migrants.Scores of labourers working at the Nirma Limited’s detergent plant in Bhavnagar district, Gujarat, allegedly went on a rampage and vandalised a staff bus in the early hours of Monday after a Shramik Special train to Uttar Pradesh was cancelled, police said.The incident took place at the labourers’ colony near Nirma plant in Kala Talav area after the workers got angry thinking the company was not letting them go to their native place during the lockdown, “which was not true”, Superintendent of Police Jaipalsinh Rathore said.An FIR had been lodged against some workers for rioting, he added.While about 1.76 lakh or 70 per cent of the 2.56 lakh migrants, who left Gujarat had travelled to Uttar Pradesh, others set out on their journey to Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Chhatisgarh, a Gujarat government official said.Among various cities in Gujarat, the largest number of migrant workers had left for their home states on trains from the textile hub Surat, followed by Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Rajkot and other districts, the official said.Thousands of migrant workers are also moving out of the COVID-19 hotbed of Mumbai, many of them in taxis and autorickshaws.Union sources in Mumbai pegged the number of ‘kaali peeli’ taxis (traditional black & yellow taxis) and autos leaving the metropolis at around 1,000 and 5,000, respectively.The National Highway Number 3, also called Mumbai-Agra Road, that touches Indore in Madhya Pradesh through a bypass road, is seeing a steady stream of autorickshaws from the country's commercial capital as well as people on bicycles hoping to pedal their way as far as Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh or Kalahandi in Odisha.Among them is Baleshwar Yadav (54), who is going to his native village in Jharkhand's Hazaribagh, with eight people, including two women and three children, cramming into his three-wheeler.“I have been driving an autorickshaw in Mumbai for the past 12 years. But everything is closed there now. I spent two months digging into my savings but that, too, has run out. I have no choice but to return to my village,” he said.Indore Deputy Superintendent of Police (Traffic) Umakant Chaudhary said autorickshaws were being allowed to pass only after those inside are subjected to medical screening when they enter the border of Madhya Pradesh.Chaudhary said CNG-fitted autorickshaws were seen in long queues at fuel pumps on the Indore Bypass road since the number of pumps selling CNG on this route is less.A cyclist on the Mumbai-Agra highway said he saw migrants travelling in trucks, auto-rickshaws and bikes on way to their native places in central and north India.AL Quadros of the Mumbai Taximens Union said over a 1,000 black-and-yellow taxis and 5,000 auto-rickshaws from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region had left the region.There were around 45,000 black and yellow cabs and around 5 lakh autorickshaws in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, he said.Sujit Singh, an auto driver from Mumbai’s Vakola area, said he left for Uttar Pradesh in a group of about 50 autorickshaws from their area on Saturday, and on Monday morning reached Madhya Pradesh, travelling via Nashik.With only one good leg, Ramjeevan Nishad, 27, has already cycled over 80 km since he left Nallasopara, a suburb of Mumbai, to reach Vasind. He is part of a group of dozen whose destination is Gorakhpur, 1,600 km away.At least 17 people were injured in an accident involving four vehicles, including one carrying migrant labourers, on the highway in Maharashtra’s Nashik district on Monday morning, police said.A state official said the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses would conduct more than 300 trips to the borders of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh for migrants in the next two days, as they would run half of their normal capacity to maintain social distancing among passengers.“The state government has observed that migrant labourers are in no mood to stay back despite several appeals made by the state government.

They were coming from Hyderabad.In the letter, Bhalla also referred to the meeting chaired by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba on Sunday. “In the meeting, the situation of migrant workers walking on roads and railway tracks was noted with great concern,” he said in the letter.“Since their movement by buses and ‘Shramik' special trains has already been allowed to enable their travel to native places, all state/UT governments should ensure that migrant workers do not resort to walking on road and on railway tracks,” the letter read.“In case they are found in such condition, they should be appropriately counselled, taken to nearby shelters and provided with food, water etc till such time they are facilitated to board the Shramik Special trains or buses to their native places,” Bhalla said, while urging that the states should allow receiving of all Shramik special trains “without any hindrance and facilitate faster movement of stranded migrant workers” to their native places.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-asks-states-uts-to-ensure-migrant-labourers-dont-resort-to-walking-on-road-rail-tracks-83367

The country also reported 1,559 recoveries in a day. Officials said 20,917 patients had been cured so far---putting India’s recovery rate at 35.1 per cent.The rising rate of infections prompted authorities to urge people with symptoms to “come forward to report so that they don't spread infection to others”.“Aarogya Setu mobile app has contributed significantly in India's fight against COVID-19,” Ajay Sawhney, chairman of the Empowered Group 9 who also addressed the press briefing, said.The new record breaking rise in COVID cases comes just a week ahead of the expiry of Lockdown 3 deadline on May 17.Worried over the sudden spike, the central government issued two video messages on Monday. The videos feature actor Amitabh Bachchan who asks people not to ignore three key symptoms of COVID-19---fever, cough, short breath---and not to stigmatise patients.The ministry said the sudden spike in cases could be a result of gradual unravelling of a latent disease burden with people fearing to come out and report symptoms from fear of stigma.The central government on Monday also said mild and moderate patients would not need RTPCR tests before being discharged provided their symptoms have been resolved.“Only severe patients will need a negative RTPCR confirmation before discharge,” officials said.Aarogya SetuThe central government also said 9.8 crore people have downloaded the Arogya Setu application so far, and allayed fears of data breach saying it was the most data secure app in the world---only data of COVID positive users was transferred to the server for alerting health systems to prevent development of given areas as potential hotspots, officials said.The central government said the data remains safe in the users’ devices and in case the users are non COVID positive the data will automatically be deleted in a month and for positive users the data will be deleted 60 days after the person turns COVID negative.Out of 9.8 crore users data from only 13,000 positive users has been transferred to the server so far, government representative Ajay Sahni, heading the empowered group on COVID data said.Rising casesIn Maharashtra, the Covid-19 cases mounted to 22,171, followed by Gujarat that has 8,194 cases and Tamil Nadu reporting 7,204 cases so far.The state of Maharashtra has also reported the highest number of deaths, at least 832, which is followed by Gujarat (493) and Madhya Pradesh (215).At least 6,923 people in the national capital have been infected with the highly contagious Coronavirus.States which have reported more than 3,000 cases are Rajasthan (3,814), Madhya Pradesh(3,614) and Uttar Pradesh (3,467).Other major states and Union Territories that have reported more than 1,000 cases, are Andhra Pradesh (19,80), West Bengal (1,939), Punjab (1,823) and Telangana (1,196).Among other major states and UTs that have reported a significant number of cases are, Bihar (696), Haryana (703), Jammu and Kashmir (861), Karnataka (848), Kerala (512), Odisha (377), Tripura (150) and Chandigarh (169).States/UTs that have zero coronavirus cases are Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Manipur, Mizoram and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

AI Flt 1803 has just landed in Bengaluru," tweeted External Affairs Minister S.

11-05-2020||London||Nirav Modi's extradition trial in PNB fraud case to begin in UK||Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, fighting extradition to India on charges over the nearly USD 2 billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and money laundering case, is set to be produced before a UK court for his trial on Monday, to take place in a part-remote setting due to the coronavirus lockdown.The 49-year-old jeweller, who has been lodged at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest in March last year, is expected to be produced physically at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London.However, given the social distancing measures being followed by prisons and courts, District Judge Samuel Goozee had conceded that an alternative would be for him to be produced via video link."Some prisons are producing prisoners in person, so I will direct Wandsworth Prison to produce Modi in person for the trial from May 11. If that is not practicable, his participation by live link remains a backstop,” Judge Goozee said at the last remand hearing in the case on April 28.It has been agreed that a limited number of legal representatives will be present physically in court for the trial, while witnesses give their evidence via video link. Modi will be able to observe the proceedings either from the dock, if the prison authorities agree to a physical transfer, or via the judiciary's common viewing system (CVP) from Wandsworth Prison.The five-day hearing starting on Monday relates to the Indian government's extradition request certified by the UK government last year.The case has been filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and relates to a large-scale fraud upon an Indian PSU through the fraudulent obtaining of letters of understanding (LoUs) and the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.Two additional charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death” were added on by the CBI and certified earlier this year.“The May 11 extradition hearing is going ahead and the new request (two additional offences part of the CBI case) has not been joined but will be dealt with at a separate later hearing, probably in July,” said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), appearing on behalf of the Indian authorities.CPS barrister Nick Hearn told the court at the last hearing in April, held via tele-conference, that the Government of India's representatives would be following the proceedings and giving instructions via the court's online common viewing platform, given the COVID-19 related travel restrictions.“We have received comprehensive responses in writing from the Government of India, which would reduce the likely length of cross-examinations,” said Hearn.It was also confirmed that the diamond merchant would not be giving evidence in the case, but his legal team plans to produce around six witnesses, including a jewellery expert as well as judicial and prisons experts.Most of the legal cases in the UK have incorporated video link and telephonic options where possible amid the social distancing rules in place to combat the coronavirus pandemic.Modi, whose Wandsworth Prison is considered one of the most over-crowded in England, had made a fifth attempt at bail in the High Court last month, which was rejected as the judge ruled that he continued to pose a flight risk.The jeweller was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard on charges of fraud and money laundering brought by the Indian government.

After the appointment of Marshall Billingslea as the chief negotiator for a new Treaty, the US has attempted to convince Russia that long-range Chinese missiles will someday pose a danger to Moscow and other important centres.China has so far taken the stand that it is not eligible to join the high table because its missiles are far fewer and less lethal than that of the US and Russia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pressure-on-china-to-join-nuke-control-pact-83305

In Ramesh Gelli’s case in 2016, it had enlarged the ambit of the PCA by holding that two top officials of Global Trust Bank were “public servants” who could be prosecuted for corruption.The interpretation is in tune with its verdict in Subramanian Swamy versus Manmohan Singh (2012) in which it said an anti¬-corruption law had to be interpreted in a manner that strengthens the fight against corruption.Of late corruption has reached alarming proportions as reflected in various scams. According to Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index released at World Economic Forum, Davos, in January 2020, India is ranked 80th among 180 countries.“Today, corruption in our country not only poses a grave danger to the concept of constitutional governance, it also threatens the very foundation of Indian democracy and the Rule of Law. The magnitude of corruption in our public life is incompatible with the concept of a socialist, secular democratic republic... where corruption begins all rights end,” SC said in Swamy’s case.India’s anti-corruption law was framed in pre-liberalisation era when the government had a wider role to play in nation building. But post-liberalisation, many of the functions performed by the state, including power distribution, education and health, have been undertaken by private sector. Can an entity performing a “public function” escape the wrath of anti-corruption law applicable to “public servants”?After India ratified the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) in 2011, Parliament amended PCA in 2018 to address many of the shortcomings.Whether in public sector of private sector – corruption violates human rights and undermines justice, liberty, equality, fraternity – the core constitutional objectives set out in the preamble.The Supreme Court has tried to fill the legislative void by giving a purposive interpretation to the pre-liberalisation PCA. It’s time necessary tweaking is done to make it a more effective legal tool in fight against corruption.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rise-in-graft-cases-calls-for-filling-gaps-in-anti-corruption-law-83303

11-05-2020||/PTI||Post Vizag, MHA issues safety norms for restarting industries||New Delhi, May 10In the wake of the Visakhapatnam gas leak incident, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) today issued a set of detailed guidelines for the re-opening of industrial units after the lockdown is lifted on May 17.The ministry has directed the industrial units to consider the first week of the opening of plants as the trial or test-run period and ensure that all safety protocols were followed. During this period, the manufacturing units are suggested not to make efforts to meet high production targets.First week to be Trial periodThe Ministry of Home Affairs has directed industrial units to consider the first week of the opening of plants as the trial or test-run period and ensure that all safety protocols were followed.In a communique to all states and union territories, the NDMA said due to several weeks of lockdown and closure of industrial units, it is possible that some of the operators might not have followed the established standard operating procedures. As a result, some of the manufacturing facilities, pipelines and valves may have residual chemicals, which may pose risk. The same is true for the storage facilities with hazardous chemicals and flammable material, it said.“To minimise possible risk, it is important that employees who work on specific equipment are sensitised and made aware of the need to identify abnormalities like strange sounds or smell, exposed wires, vibrations, leaks, smoke, abnormal wobbling, irregular grinding or other potentially hazardous signs, which indicate the need for immediate maintenance or if required, shutdown,” the MHA said in the guidelines.Besides safety of plants, the MHA has also insisted that industrial units should ensure sanitisation of factory premises regularly and health checkup of workers as per the Health Ministry protocol.According to the new guidelines, the factories need to maintain a sanitisation routine, especially in the common areas like lunchrooms and common tables, which will have to be wiped clean with disinfectant after every use.Temperature of all employees has to be checked at the entrance of the premises twice a day and workers showing symptoms should not report to work. Hand sanitisers, mask and gloves have been made mandatory for all employees in all factories and manufacturing units. Managerial and administrative staff should work one shift at 33 per cent capacity as per the MHA guidelines.As per the guidelines, industrial units have been asked to educate workers on the safety steps they have to follow during their stay at plants. The protocol also directs the units to ensure no sharing of tools or workstations as much as possible and provide additional sets of tools if needed.Dos and don’ts||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-vizag-mha-issues-safety-norms-for-restarting-industries-83284

11-05-2020||New Delhi||India, China skirmishes in Ladakh, Sikkim; many hurt||Troops of nuclear-armed India and China have clashed in eastern Ladakh and north Sikkim along the un-demarcated and disputed frontier between the two neighbours, leaving many injured on both sides.Details are emerging of the ongoing development in eastern Ladakh, which is much bigger in scale and has wider ramifications than the clash in north Sikkim.Sources say on the intervening night of May 5 and 6, a clash erupted at a spot called ‘Finger 5’ on the northern bank of the Pangong Tso (lake) in eastern Ladakh. It was one of the spots where pitched battles were fought during the 1962 war. In 2017, troops had hurled stones at each other near the spot. In the latest incident, troops on both sides received injuries, said a senior official without confirming either the nature of injuries or the number of those injured.The Northern Army Commander visited the spot after being apprised of the skirmish. Sources said as a precautionary measure, forces had been substantially reinforced on both sides. However, they ruled out any escalation for now. It all started on April 27 when the troops came face to face. On the night of May 5 and 6, the Chinese troops clashed with Indian jawans at an attitude of 14,000 feet. More than 250 men were involved in the fracas. A meeting of senior commanders was conducted, but matters flared up again today.India and China have an un-demarcated 3,448-km boundary called the Line of Actual Control running all along the Himalayan ridgeline in an east-west alignment. The Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial-melt lake that straddles both countries, has boat patrols from either side.Eastern Ladakh has been militarily “tailored” to prevent a repeat of 1962 — when China, with exceptions like Rezang La, literally overran the Indian military defences.In north Sikkim, a clash on Saturday led to injuries to troops, including four from the Indian side. The incident occurred in the ‘Naku La sector’ ahead of Muguthang.‘Need to broaden national security doctrine’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-skirmishes-in-ladakh-sikkim-many-hurt-83125
11-05-2020||New Delhi||Job loss among labourers, small traders alarming||One of the main focus areas of PM Narendra Modi’s videoconferencing with chief ministers on Monday will be taking steps to whittle the burgeoning unemployment figures, said sources.As per the latest figures, the unemployment rate crossed 27 per cent for the week ended May 3 and the new statistics expected early next week may also offer little cheer.The potential of social unrest in both rural and urban areas, with protests being regularly staged in all parts of the country by jobless migrants a precursor, is turning around the Centre to take a different stance of “living with Corona”.Ever since the lockdown, joblessness has risen from single digits to 23.5 per cent for the entire locked-down month of April. For the week ended May 3, it had further risen by four per cent in all sectors barring agriculture. The expected easing of the lockdown, sources said, anticipates immediate reduction of joblessness among wage labourers and small traders who account for around 13 crore of total 28 crore unemployed to date due to the lockdown.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/job-loss-among-labourers-small-traders-alarming-83122
11-05-2020||New Delhi||PM’s video conference with CMs today||With Lockdown 3.0 entering home stretch this week, PM Narendra Modi will interact with chief ministers on Monday as the country eagerly awaits next course both central and state governments will adopt to improve the economy in the ongoing fight against Covid-19.Areas of concernSince the Centre and states embarked on a collective path of nationwide lockdown, the approach of states has varied in terms of interpretation of the guidelines issued by the Centre and a common approach on this count is on the cards.While many states have extended lockdown till month-end, the possibility of another uniform application will have to be weighed against larger context of the need to fire engines of economy on various fronts.Over the past few weeks, the Centre has issued orders to open up sectors in a calibrated manner. While measures to boost agriculture have borne fruit with procurement under way in states, other sectors, including manufacturing, are yet to resume operations the way government may want to see in permitted areas.The governments also remain concerned over key challenges in the form of demand and supply constraints, including reduced availability of skilled workers, many of whom have either migrated to their native places and are in the process of doing so.Monday’s meeting, the fifth such interaction on the issue the PM will have with CMs, also comes amid continuing struggle of workers stuck in various parts of the country, with some turning restive and preferring a more arduous journey on foot.For over a week now, the Railways has been running ‘Shramik Special’ trains to ferry the stranded migrants amid political tussle over passenger fare, with many states announcing to underwrite the costs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pms-video-conference-with-cms-today-83121
