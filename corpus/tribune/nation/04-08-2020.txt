04-08-2020||Vibha Sharma||A dream close to my heart is getting fulfilled, says Advani||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 4Veteran BJP leader LK Advani, who along with late Vishwa Hindu Parishad chief Ashok Singhal, is counted among key figures of the ‘Ram Janmabhoomi movement’ on Tuesday called August 5, the day of the ‘bhumi pujan’ of the Ram Temple,  “historical and emotional day” not just for him but all Indians.A day before the grand ceremony at Ayodhya the BJP veteran wrote that he was “feeling humbled that during the movement, destiny made him perform a pivotal duty in the form of the Ram Rath Yatra that helped galvanise aspirations, energies and passions of its countless participants”.“A grand mandir for Shri Ram at Ram Janmabhoomi has been a desire and mission for the Bharatiya Janata Party,” said Advani who is credited with helping the saffron party reclaim the agitation by launching the Rath Yatra in 1990, raising the ‘Hindutva’ pitch that resulted in rich dividends for the saffron party in years that followed.“Sometimes significant dreams in one’s life take a long time to fruition, but when they are finally realised, the wait becomes very worthwhile. One such dream, close to my heart is now getting fulfilled.“I feel humbled that during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, destiny made me perform a pivotal duty in the form of the Ram Rath Yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya in 1990, which helped galvanise the aspirations, energies and passions of its countless participants,” said Advani.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi is laying the foundation for the construction of Shri Ram Mandir at Ayodhya, the birthplace of Shri Ram and it is indeed a historical and emotional day not only for me, but for all Indians.  “It is also my belief that Shri Ram Mandir will represent India as a strong, prosperous, peaceful and harmonious nation with justice for all and exclusion of none so that we can truly usher in Ram Rajya, the epitome of good governance,” he said.On this auspicious occasion, I want to express my gratitude to the scores of saints, leaders and people from India and the world over who made valuable contributions and sacrifices in the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.“I am also very happy that due to the decisive verdict of the Supreme Court in November 2019, the construction of Shri Ram Mandir is getting started in an environment of tranquillity. This will go a long way in strengthening the bond between Indians.Shri Ram occupies an esteemed place in India’s cultural and civilisational heritage and is an embodiment of grace, dignity and decorum. It is my belief that this temple will inspire all Indians to imbibe his virtues,” said Advani.Incidentally, few among current senior BJP leaders, and that includes Amit Shah, Nitin Gadkari, Rajnath Singh and JP Nadda, have any direct link with the agitation or ‘Rath Yatra’. Led by the then president of the BJP, LK Advani, the purpose of the yatra was to support the agitation, led by VHP and Sangh Parivar, affiliates. Among those by his side on the ‘Rath’ were late Pramod Mahajan and Narendra Modi, the then BJP’s Gujarat organisation secretary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-dream-close-to-my-heart-is-getting-fulfilled-says-advani-122119

So I worked much harder this time,” said Singh (23), whose father was a petrol pump attendant in Dewas Naka here for 28 years before leaving to set up a small transport business last year.Singh was selected for the Indian Revenue Service based on his 2018 ranking and was undergoing training at Nagpur’s National Direct Taxes Academy, from where he took leave for another crack at the exams for the coveted IAS tag.“Life was full of struggle till college as my father worked as a petrol pump attendant and his salary was much less than our household expenses. However, from Class VII, I had decided I would become an IAS officer. With time, my resolve got stronger and I worked harder to achieve my dream,” he told PTI.A visibly elated Manoj Singh said his son had done everyone proud by clearing such a tough exam so brilliantly.“By the grace of Lord Mahakaleshwar, my son has become an IAS officer,” he said.

04-08-2020||---||An absurd exercise, says India as Pakistan unveils 'new map’||New Delhi, August 4India on Tuesday described Pakistan’s new “political map” as an exercise in political absurdity. “These ridiculous assertions” of laying claims to parts of Gujarat and the UTs of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh have neither legal validity nor international credibility, said the Ministry of External Affairs.“In fact, this new effort only confirms reality of Pakistan’s obsession with territorial aggrandisement supported by cross-border terrorism,” added the statement.Earlier in the day, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, with Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi by his side, embarked on a new attempt to rake up the Kashmir dispute.Qureshi’s last week’s attempt at the UN had failed to yield dividends. The UN Security Council discussed Kashmir but behind closed doors last week with no records kept of the meeting, said India’s UN Permanent Representative TS Tirumurti.The “new political map” was another attempt to internationally project the Kashmir issue as a dispute ahead of the first anniversary of rearrangement of J&K, said sources.Qureshi said the “official map” would now be used in schools and colleges. Giving a commentary on the map’s salient features, he said Kashmir borders had been kept open-ended as it was a disputed territory. The map also includes an eastward shift of the disputed Sir Creek in Gujarat and a claim over the Siachen Glacier.India has maintained all that remains to be discussed on Kashmir is the return of territories occupied by Pakistan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/an-absurd-exercise-says-india-as-pakistan-unveils-new-map-122109
04-08-2020||New Delhi||NRAI defers national camp for indefinite period||The national shooting federation (NRAI) on Tuesday deferred the 'compulsory' national camp for its Olympic core group for an indefinite period on health safety grounds.Reviewing the decision taken during the emerging meeting of its governing council on July 14, the NRAI said the "health and safety of its shooters and coaches was of paramount importance" in the times of the COVID-19 pandemic.The NRAI had decided to conduct a national camp in the first week of August."Under the prevailing conditions with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Governing Body decided to defer the camp, till the time conditions are safer all-around as well as suitable for outstation travel," the national federation said in a statement."Health and safety of Shooters/Coaches was paramount in the review of the decision. NRAI will announce a new schedule at a later date." The training was postponed on last Thursday after a shooting coach at the camp's venue – Dr Karni Singh Range – tested positive for COVID-19.A handful of shooters such as World Cup medallist Sanjeev Rajput, Manu Bhaker and Anish Bhanwala have been training at the facility for the last few days alongside shotgun marksmen like Sheeraz Sheikh and Mairaj Ahmad Khan since it reopened on July 8.They are likely to continue with their daily practice, adhering to the health and safety protocols.While the shooters residing in places such as Delhi and Haryana resumed training at the range, those living outside the National Capital Region (NCR) were apprehensive, considering the threat travelling could pose.Both Bhaker and Rajput are quota holders for the Tokyo Olympics.A total of 15 Indian shooters have secured quota places for the Olympic Games, postponed to next year due to the raging pandemic.The NRAI had appointed High-Performance Manager and former India shooter Ronak Pandit as the Nodal Officer in charge of overall coordination for hygiene and medical protocols at the camp.

But the most effective weapon will be gram and fruit, he said.These will be offered to the monkeys some distance away from the site to keep them busy.Sanitation workers, home guards and animal husbandry department employees will be on the job, the official said.

04-08-2020||---||Contempt proceedings against Prashant Bhushan: SC reserves order after ‘muted’ hearing||New Delhi, August 4 The Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved its orders on acceptability of a statement submitted by activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan who is facing criminal contempt proceedings for his 2009 statement allegedly scandalising the judiciary."Explanation/apology submitted by Mr. Prashant Bhushan/ Respondent No.1 and Mr. Tarun Tejpal/Respondent No.2, have not been received so far. In case we do not accept the explanation/apology, we will hear the matter,” a three-judge Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said while reserving its order.Most part of the hearing that took place in two sessions remained ‘muted’ as the Bench chose to speak to senior counsel Rajeev Dhavan, representing Bhushan, on phone.The development happened on a day when 16 eminent members of the civil society, including activist Aruna Roy, moved the Supreme Court seeking to intervene in the matter, contending contempt proceedings against Bhushan amounted to stifling free speech.At the very outset Justice Mishra asked Dhavan to demarcate the thin line between free speech and contempt of court. "How do we save the grace of the system and bring this to an end as well?" the Bench asked Dhavan."Mr Bhushan has given an explanation. That explanation can put an end to this," Dhavan replied.Thereafter Justice Mishra spoke to Dhavan and senior counsel Kapil Sibal, representing the then Tehelka Editor Tarun Tejpal, on phone and the hearing appeared to have ended for the day. However, the hearing resumed in late afternoon.The Bench, which resumed hearing in the matter last month after nine years, said it wanted the parties to issue statements tendering their apologies to end the matter.Bhushan, who refused to tender an apology, issued a statement expressing regret."In my interview to Tehelka in 2009 I have used the word corruption in a wide sense meaning lack of propriety. I did not mean only financial corruption or deriving any pecuniary advantage. If what I have said caused hurt to any of them or to their families in any way, I regret the same,” Bhushan's wrote in his statement.“I unreservedly state that I support the institution of the judiciary and especially the Supreme Court of which I am a part, and had no intention to lower the prestige of the judiciary in which I have complete faith,” read the statement.“I regret if my interview was misunderstood as doing so, that is, lower the reputation of the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court, which could never have been my intention at all," the statement added.In the post-lunch session, the Bench indicated it might pass an order that allegations of corruption in the judiciary would amount to contempt per se. But Dhavan argued that such can’t be done without hearing the parties.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/contempt-proceedings-against-prashant-bhushan-sc-reserves-order-after-muted-hearing-122105

He claimed the post-mortem report mentioned injuries to her private parts.Police maintain that she died by suicide.Rajput, 34, was found hanging at his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14. Mumbai Police registered an Accidental Death Report and an investigation is underway.“Sushant did not commit suicide but was murdered,” Rane said. He claimed that the state government is trying to save somebody in the matter.Though Bihar Police filed an FIR in the case, no FIR has been filed by Mumbai Police, he said.“It has been 50 days since Sushant’s death but Mumbai’s world-famous police don’t know who was with Sushant at the party held (at his home) on June 13, Rane said.Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh on Monday said no party took place at the actor’s home on June 13.Rane said Salian died on June 8, but her post-mortem was conducted only on June 11 “which is surprising”.Rane said Sushant’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, who stayed at the actor’s residence, has gone missing and claimed the police have no idea about her going missing.On his claim that the state government is trying to protect someone, Rane said, “Who was threatening Sushant for more than 20 days? He was changing SIM cards every day. Why is this not being investigated? I am sure they are trying to save someone.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sushant-was-murdered-claims-former-maharashtra-cm-narayan-rane-122096

He also highlighted the need to provide face masks, sanitisers and PPE to them.On behalf of the Centre, senior advocate V Mohana submitted that states were already making efforts in this regard and this was not an adversarial issue.The top court said the elderly people should be given priority in the admission in the government hospitals in view of their vulnerability for COVID-19. In event of any complaint, the hospital administration concerned shall take immediate steps to remedy their grievances, it added.The Bench said directions issued by it in December 2018 in the matter should be implemented keeping in view the pandemic situation prevailing in the country.In its December 2018 verdict, it had said that statutory rights of over 10 crore elderly persons in India must be recognised and implemented.It had directed the Centre to obtain information from all states and union territories about the number of old age homes in each district and had also suggested a relook at the pension for the elderly so as to make it more realistic.Emphasising on the social justice aspect, it had said the state was obligated to ensure that the right to live with dignity, shelter and health of citizens, including the elderly, were not only protected but also enforced.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disburse-pension-ppe-face-masks-to-the-elderly-sc-122095

Police registered a case against the accused Pentaiah under sections 302, 201 and 376 of the POCSO Act. Expressing satisfaction at the judgement, the father of the victim expressed satisfaction and said the soul of his child would now find peace. The judgement would have come earlier but due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, the man got three extra months to live, said the victim's lawyer.Andhra Pradesh has put into force the AP Disha Act, 2019 that calls for the quick trail in cases of heinous crimes against women. Under the Disha Act, proposed by the AP state government, the accused will get capital punishment 60 days of the crime if there is evidence to prove the wrongdoing.The Andhra Pradesh Government has also set up 18 Disha police stations in the state for speedy investigation of sexual offences against women.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-sentenced-to-death-for-raping-7-year-old-122083
04-08-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||Temporary relief to agitating Amaravati farmers||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, August 4 After farmers in the Amaravati Capital Region of Andhra Pradesh intensified their campaign to stop trifurcation of the state capital, the Andhra Pradesh High Court has ordered a status quo putting a freeze on Governor Gazette to notify the issue.  The stay on the Decentralisation of Development and Capital Region Developmental Authority Repeal legislations till August 14 comes with a direction to the government to file a counter reply to the petition by the affected farmers. Amaravati farmers along with Joint Action Committee (JAC) comprising of Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and others had filed a petition seeking a stay. At the same time the farmers around Amaravati, some of them whose land had been acquired by the previous TDP government have intensified their protest asking the AP government to reconsider the trifurcation. In January this year, the state assembly had introduced two bills for the trifurcation of the capital. Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions (APDIDAR), Act 2020, and the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Developmental Authority Repeal Act 2020. Ever since there have been protests in the state with the farmers seeking scrapping to trifurcation whereas the TDP has given a 48-hour ultimatum to the Andhra Pradesh government to scrap the move or face fresh elections, which are due no time soon. As the protesters from various villages formed a human chain along the road, while maintaining social distance, many were on their knees and with folded hands outside the High Court as the convoys of judges passed. The protesters pleaded that their interests are protected and the government withdraw its move to develop three state capitals.  The state Governor recently cleared the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Developmental Authority Repeal Act 2020 and APDIDAR Act paving way for shifting key capital functions from Amaravati.The government plans to develop Visakhapatnam as the executive capital. With the shifting of the offices of the Chief Minister, Governor, ministers, and secretaries to the coastal city, it will become the seat of power. Kurnool will be developed as the judicial capital by shifting the High Court there. Amaravati, which was originally planned as the only state capital and a world-class city, will house the State legislature.  About 24,000 farmers contributed 33,000 acres of land under a land pooling scheme for the mega plans to build Amaravati on the banks of Krishna river as the dream capital for Andhra Pradesh under the TDP Government. Farmers received allotment papers and were promised Rs 50,000 annuity per acre with an annual hike of 10 per cent for giving away their land. But soon after taking over the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) scrapped the capital project and subsequently all investing partners withdrew their offer to finance the project, causing distress to all stakeholders.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/temporary-relief-to-agitating-amaravati-farmers-122082

Until further orders, we direct the release of the petitioners (Badola and Nair) on bail on furnishing personal bond for a sum of Rs 10,000 each, forthwith, to the satisfaction of the concerned authorities,” the Bench said in its order.According to the petitioners, a 22-year-old woman, who was illiterate and used to work as cook at their residences, was gang raped on July 6 and after the incident she had called one of them for help.The plea said that on July 10, the woman was summoned for the purposes of recording of her statement before a magistrate and she had requested the petitioners, who were working with a Araria-based NGO, to accompany her to the court.It said when the statement was being read over to her, the woman expressed some concerns and requested that the petitioners be allowed to come in and read out the statement to her.“The magistrate unfortunately mistook this as a criticism of the court, refusing to listen to any explanation he remanded all three persons to police custody,” the plea said, adding that they had at no point “meant or displayed any disrespect to the court”.It said that on July 17, the woman was granted bail by the court but the bail plea of the petitioners was rejected.The plea said that courts in Bihar are not able to function due to the COVID-19 pandemic and their plea against the July 17 order is pending before a sessions court.The plea has alleged that the “FIR on the basis of which the three persons were arrested and sent to jail is without jurisdiction or authority of law”.“It is respectfully submitted that their continued incarceration and curtailment of personal liberty is untenable in law and facts and without judicious application of mind,” it said, adding that the petitioners are “completely innocent” and offences alleged against them are not made out.It claimed that the “allegation of uncalled behaviour, threatening the presiding officer and demanding re-recording of the statement of the survivor is completely false and baseless”.

While the WHO recommends 140 tests a day per million people India’s average is 479 while 28 states have an average of more than 140 tests a day per million. Among the states performing high number of tests, Punjab, Rajasthan, MP and UP have already reached a case positivity rate less than 5 per cent,” Bhushan said today.Punjab is among states conducting a large number of tests. While India’s tests per million average is 15,119, the data for Punjab is 20,221.The following states have case positivity rate less than 10 per cent—Haryana (5.40 pc), Assam (6.10 pc), West Bengal (9 pc) and Karnataka 9.80 pc.Tests per million in Haryana are 24,914, much higher than the national average.India today crossed the milestone of conducting more than 2 crore cumulative COVID tests with a record 6.60 lakh tests in 24 hours.Recovered cases -- 12, 30, 509 are now more than double of the active cases 586296.Case fatality rate in the country dropped to 2.10 pc at the lowest level since the first lock down.Meanwhile, the government also shared mortality analysis today saying 68 per cent of all 38,938 COVID deaths in India as of today have involved men and the rest women.Even today, 87 pc of deaths are happening in the age group 45 to 60 plus years with half of all deaths among 60 plus people and 37 pc of all deaths in 45 to 60 year olds.Age groups below 17 years and 18 to 25 years both make up one per cent each of overall deaths.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-posts-lowest-covid-positivity-rate-of-3-1-pc-in-india-national-average-8-89-pc-122066
04-08-2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh Congress will send 11 silver bricks for Ram Temple: Kamal Nath||Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath on Tuesday hosted a ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ recital at his residence here and announced sending 11 silver bricks for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, on the eve of the “bhoomi pujan” ceremony.Nath said the silver bricks were bought from contributions made by members of the Congress.“We will send 11 silver bricks for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya on the behalf of citizens of Madhya Pradesh,” the former chief minister told reporters.He said ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ was recited for happiness, progress and prosperity of Madhya Pradesh.Welcoming the upcoming construction of a Ram temple, Nath said its foundation had been led by prime minister (late) Rajiv Gandhi “who had opened the Ram Janmabhoomi temple site in 1985”.“These are our sentiments... Rajivji had said in 1989 that ‘Ram Rajya’ should come in the country. It’s due to Rajiv Gandhi that the dream of Ram temple is coming true. Had he been alive, he would have been very happy,” Nath said.The former CM also listed various works done by his government, which collapsed in March this year, for the protection of cows and development of temples.“I had installed a huge idol of Lord Hanuman in Chhindwara. We built ‘gaushalas’ or cow shelters when in power. We also removed obstacles that came in the way of construction of ‘Ram Van Gaman Path’ (a mythological route taken by Lord Ram on his way to the 14-year exile). We had also planned the development of Mahakal and Omkareshwar temples,” he said.When asked about the BJP’s allegations that the Congress lacked a firm stand on the issue of Ram temple, Nath said, “We do think about the party line. They (BJP) think about the party line. These are our sentiments”.Earlier in the day, Nath posted his picture clad in saffron on his Twitter profile.Several leaders of the Congress, including former Union minister Arun Yadav and his MLA brother Sachin Yadav, have posted videos reciting ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ on social media.However, the ruling BJP took a swipe at the Congress, saying it was trying to take undue credit for the Ram temple.“How can the party whose president Sonia Gandhi has not spoken a word about Ram temple is trying to take credit?Devotees of Lord Ram understand this politics of the Congress,” said state Home Minister and senior BJP leader Narottam Mishra.He also referred to Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh’s demand to postpone the Wednesday’s foundation laying ceremony in Ayodhya in view of “inauspicious muhurat”.“Construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya is part of the BJP’s agenda,” said Mishra.

04-08-2020||---||Pakistan fails in another attempt to rake up Kashmir at UNSC||New Delhi, August 4India has hit back at Pakistan a day before the first anniversary of the changes in the status of Jammu and Kashmir.The immediate context for the broadside launched by India’s permanent representative to the UN, TS Tirumurti, was Pakistan’s failure to persuade the UN Security Council (UNSC) to come out with a resolution on Kashmir.Pakistan had stepped up its campaign against the August 5 abrogation of Articles 370 and 35 A, with Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi persuading China to hold a closed-door meeting on Kashmir at the UNSC.Qureshi later marked the consultations as a political victory for the Imran Khan government since this was the second time in six months that the UNSC had discussed Kashmir.Tirumurti said Pakistan’s latest attempt had also fallen flat.“Attempts by Pakistan to try and internationalise what is a bilateral issue is nothing new. Contrary to what Qureshi has asserted, there has been no formal meeting of the UNSC on the India-Pakistan issue since 1965.”“What came up recently was a closed-door and completely informal meeting under the category of ‘any other business’, which is not even a recorded discussion,” Tirumurti pointed out.“Even the UN Secretary-General, in his statement of August 2019, clearly referred to the 1972 bilateral Shimla Agreement. Consequently, Pakistan’s efforts haven’t met any traction in UNSC. Even if Pakistan persists, there are no takers here in the UN,” Tirumurti added.“It is a well-known fact that Pakistan is home to the largest number of listed terrorists, internationally designated terrorist entities and individuals. Under the 1267 Committee, which submits its report periodically on terrorist activities of the ISIL, the Al-Qaeda and its affiliates. There are several direct references to Pakistan’s involvement,” pointed out the diplomat.India will join the UNSC for a two-year membership from January 1, 2021, for the eighth time.Qureshi has also opposed India’s quest for permanent membership at the UNSC by stating that expansion will “compound, not resolve, UNSC’s paralysis”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-fails-in-another-attempt-to-rake-up-kashmir-at-unsc-122055
04-08-2020||Dehradun||COVID-19: Disposed PPE could be turned into biofuel, say Indian scientists||Indian scientists have suggested a method to convert the plastic used in personal protective equipment (PPE) into renewable liquid fuels, an advance that could help mitigate the problem of dumped PPE, currently being disposed of at unprecedented levels due to the COVID-19 pandemic.According to the study, published in the journal Biofuels, billions of items of disposable PPE can be converted from its plastic state into biofuels using a high-temperature chemical process called pyrolysis.Sapna Jain, lead author of the study from The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, noted in a statement that the transformation into biocrude—a type of synthetic fuel—“will not just prevent the severe after-effects to humankind and the environment but also produce a source of energy”.“Presently, the world is focusing to combat COVID-19, however, we can foresee the issues of economic crisis and ecological imbalance also. We have to prepare ourselves to meet the challenges which are forcefully imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, so as to maintain sustainability,” Jain said.She said the disposal of PPE is a concern owing to its material—non-woven polypropylene (plastic)--adding that these are being designed for single use followed by disposal.According to the researchers, when these plastic materials are discharged into the environment they end up in landfill or oceans, as their natural degradation is difficult at ambient temperature.“They need decades to decompose. Recycling these polymers requires both physical methods and chemical methods,” Jain said.She said the proposed strategy is a suggestive measure addressing the anticipated problem of disposal of PPE.In the study, the scientists explored the current policies around the disposal of PPEs, their polypropylene content, and the feasibility of converting them into biofuel.They focused on the structure of polypropylene, its suitability for PPE, why it poses an environmental threat, and methods of recycling the plastic material.Based on their analysis, the scientists call for the PPE waste to be converted into fuel using pyrolysis—a chemical process for breaking down plastic at high temperature between 300 to 400 degree Celsius for an hour without oxygen.“Pyrolysis is the most commonly used chemical method whose benefits include the ability to produce high quantities of bio-oil which is easily biodegradable,” study co-author Bhawna Yadav Lamba said.“There is always a need for alternative fuels or energy resources to meet our energy demands. The pyrolysis of plastics is one of the methods to mitigate our energy crisis,” Lamba added.She said the challenges of PPE waste management and increasing energy demand could be addressed simultaneously by the production of liquid fuel from PPE kits.“The liquid fuel produced from plastics is clean and has fuel properties similar to fossil fuels,” Lamba said.

The family also tried to falsely implicate her in-laws in a dowry case."We are registering a case against the mother and brother of Warisha for trying to implicate her in-laws in a dowry death case by falsely identifying the body of a woman found in a suitcase in Ghaziabad on July 27. "We have scrapped the 304 B section of IPC from the FIR after it was found that Warisha was alive, other charges as per the statement would remain intact," said SSP Bulandshahr, Santosh Kumar Singh.The development comes after police in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad found a woman's body stuffed in a suitcase. They shared photographs on social media as part of an identification drive. A woman and her son from Aligarh came forward and identified the victim as 24-year-old Warisha.According to them, Warisha went missing from her in-laws' house in Bulandshahr on July 23. They then took the body to Aligarh, where the burial took place on July 29.However, the mystery deepened on Monday when Warisha, who was assumed dead, came to the police and narrated her story to a police constable in Aligarh. It was then that the police realised that the woman in the suitcase was someone else who is yet to be identified.According to the police, Warisha's statement would be recorded in the presence of a magistrate and the reason why she left her in-laws' house and went missing would be investigated.In Ghaziabad, the identification was done by Warisha's family members, including her brother Ismail and her mother Bundu and the body was handed over to them by medical officials, who conducted the autopsy.The DNA and viscera of the woman in the suitcase was preserved by Ghaziabad police."Our officials got the viscera and the DNA of the deceased preserved...this will help us in tracing the identity of the woman whose body was found in the suitcase, a case of murder and destruction of evidence has been registered in this regard at Sahibabad," a senior police officer said.The body of the woman was buried and could be exhumed and identified.

The basic coat on the canvas of polity is Hindutva now,” Govindacharya, the BJP general secretary (organisation) between 1991-2000, said.He has since cut his ties with active politics and is associated with groups advocating nationalist and swadesi causes.As socialism and secularism were the pivots of politics between 1952-80 and 1980-2010 respectively, Hindutva has now come to acquire the same dominance, he said.Asked about criticism that some groups, especially minorities, have about Hindutva, he defended the ideology, saying it is “non-adversarial, comprehensive and has to respect for all modes of worship”.Govindacharya (77), however, cautioned that the BJP’s dominance in future cannot be taken for granted as it will depend much on the party’s emotional commitment to its ideology and value-based politics. This will also depend on how Opposition parties’ adapt to the turn in politics, he noted.Power has its “intoxicating” ingredients, and the BJP’s skills and commitment will be tested, he said.“Only future will tell if the party sticks to its values and undergoes Congress-isation,” he said.The Ram Janmbhoomi movement mobilised the masses because of its emotional resonance, he said, adding that many groups outside politics played important roles in shaping the Hindutva movement.

04-08-2020||New Delhi||2 Indians kidnapped by Taliban return home||Two Indians, who were released from Taliban captivity in Afghanistan on July 31, returned to India on Tuesday.They were among the seven Indians kidnapped in Afghanistan over two years ago. Six of them are now free.The Ministry of External Affairs thanked Kabul for its "constant and unwavering support" in securing their release.The Indians were working for Maharashtra-based KEC in an area that has witnessed pioneering work after the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. They were abducted in a village near the northern city of Pul E Khomre where India is developing electricity infrastructure that powers parts of Kabul. KEC owns an electricity substation contract in the area and has over 60 Indians working at different locations across Afghanistan.Out of the seven Indians who were abducted, one returned in March last year and three came back last October in exchange for 11 Taliban prisoners.This is not the first case of abduction of Indians in Afghanistan. Pakistan has started accusing Indian engineers working on projects close to their border with Afghanistan of fomenting terrorism. As a result, India had to ensure the hasty return of some engineers against whom Pakistan had petitioned UNSC to list them as international terrorists.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-indians-kidnapped-by-taliban-return-home-122042
04-08-2020||New Delhi||Ram Mandir Bhumi Pujan: Indian-Americans oppose public celebration in US||Pro-Hindutva organisations in the US have restricted their plans to celebrate the foundation laying ceremony of Ram Temple in Ayodhya after other Indian-Americans petitioned local mayors and authorities to not allow them to take up billboards including those at the New York’s Times Square.Editorial: Politics & spirituality: India cannot afford to remain a divided housePresident of an Indian-American organisation Jagdish Sewhani had last week announced plans to lease prominent billboards in most major US cities that would beam live images of the Bhoomi Poojan at the Ram Temple. He had envisioned it as a community event with poojas and addresses at Times Square scheduled to time with images on the Nasdaq Plus screen that is said to be the largest continuous exterior displays in the world and the highest-resolution exterior LED screen in Times Square.However, plans for a public celebration at multiple events have not just run into opposition from other Indian-Americans. About half-a-dozen Indian-American bodies have been joined by over a dozen civil society organisations that have opposed public celebrations of the event.The more eye-catching plan to hire billboards remains uncertain but there will be special poojas in some American Temples, while the faithful have been asked to light diyas at home to celebrate the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led bhoomi poojan of the Ram Temple on Wednesday.Some enthusiasts plan to hire a tableau truck with a large LED display with digital images of the Ram Temple to go around the area near the political power centres of Washington -- Capitol Hill and the White House. Incidentally, Khalistani separatists had adopted a similar approach during PM Modi’s Houston rally in September last year after failing to rustle up the numbers.Outlining the opposition to celebration of the event, Dr Manish Madan of Global Indian Progressive Alliance said in a statement that it "inadvertently celebrates violence after decades of communal divide, and tries to legitimise a Hindutva-agenda, a form of religious supremacy which is neither representative of the world’s oldest religion, Hinduism, nor does it represent the sentiments of many Indian Americans who indeed practice Hinduism.’’"I am of the same faith as the people projecting these images on August 5, and I can tell you this is not my Hinduism, which teaches love and compassion, and the oneness of us all. August 5 is not a holy day for Hindus. Its choice rubs chilli powder into the wounds of Kashmir,’’ said Sunita Vishvanathan of Hindus for Human Rights in a statement at a press conference.As of now, both sides plan to mobilise their respective sides. "Let the American people take note that those who are organising such a show in multicultural New York hide cynically behind the garb of culture and faith,’’ said Raja Swamy of India Civil Watch. He claimed that at least one major billboard company, Branded Cities, may not run the advertisements.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ram-mandir-bhumi-pujan-indian-americans-oppose-public-celebration-in-us-122040
04-08-2020||---||Economy poised for a bounce-back: Finance Ministry||New Delhi, August 4With India unlocking, the worst seems to be over for the economy as some high-frequency indicators have recovered in June from the unprecedented trough in April and May.However, risks due to rising COVID-19 cases and intermittent state lockdowns remain because 85 per cent of the cases are in the 12 top states driving growth, noted the Finance Ministry’s monthly economic report for July.The recovery will be helped by the forecast of a normal monsoon as agriculture is set to cushion the shock of the pandemic on other sectors of the economy.Punjab was one of the top five states in the recovery of electricity consumption which was an indication of the overall trend in the farm sector. It helped that while economic activity was at a standstill between April and May, the exemption of farming activities led to uninterrupted harvesting of Rabi crops and sowing of Kharif crops.The upbeat assessment coincides with an uptick in the disbursal of credit under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme. Out of sanctioned loans of about Rs. 1.38 lakh crore, Rs 92,090 crore has already been disbursed, said Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in a social media post.The assessment linked India’s future economic recovery to how the COVID infection curve evolves across the country. It’s spread to most states and UTs and the emergence of new hotspots has led the authorities to enforce intermittent lockdowns which have worked as a spanner in an orderly un-lockdown.India’s top 12 growth-driving states account for 85 per cent of the COVID caseload, with 40 per cent of confirmed cases concentrated in the country’s top two growth drivers — Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.As India unlocked, active cases grew 166 per cent in July as compared to June with Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand experiencing a second major wave of infections. Simultaneously, growth in recoveries was faster and broad-based across states, growing at 215 per cent.Touching on some flash figures, the report said GST collections inched closer to previous year’s figures and a strong recovery in electricity consumption was recorded in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Chhattisgarh, the country’s industrial and agricultural powerhouses.The value of e-way bills, suggestive of intra and inter-state movement of goods, also picked up strongly in June over May. However, growth stayed weak for COVID hotspots, namely Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Haryana. Some consumption demand recovery was witnessed from a strong improvement in vehicle registrations in June over May.On the external front, Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) inflows rebounded to a 15-month high in June, reflecting the “unshaken belief of foreign investors in India’s macroeconomic fundamentals,” said the Finance Ministry assessment.The Government hopes that the farm sector is poised for a higher growth trajectory by giving farmers the option to sell anywhere and to anyone through two Ordinances.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/economy-poised-for-a-bounce-back-finance-ministry-122033

It also directed the registrar of the court to fix the proceedings at 2 pm on September 3 before a larger bench.“We appoint Abid Hassan Manto, Hamid Khan, Senior Advocates of the Supreme Court and former presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association, and Makhdoom Ali Khan, Senior Advocate Supreme Court and former Attorney General of Pakistan, as amici curiae for our legal assistance in general and, in particular, to ensure that the judgement of the International Court is effectively implemented,” the court said in its order.The Pakistan government in its petition has claimed that Jadhav refused to file a review petition or an application to reconsider the verdict against him by the military court.“We feel that in order to ensure the effectiveness of the review and reconsideration of the conviction and sentence of Commander Jadhav, a reasonable opportunity ought to be extended to the latter and the Government of India to arrange legal representation and to file a petition."We, therefore, at this stage restrain ourselves from appointing a counsel on behalf of Commander Jadhav and advise the Government of Pakistan to extend an opportunity to Jadhav and the Government of India for arranging legal representation in terms of Article 32(1)(c) of the Convention and in accordance with the applicable laws,” the court order said.The court also asked the Pakistan government to communicate the order to the Indian government.Responding to the judge's remarks, Pakistan's Attorney General Khalid Javed Khan said an ordinance was issued to give an opportunity to India and Jadhav to file a review petition against the sentence."We will contact India again through the Foreign Office," he said.He told the court that Jadhav was being taken care of and was in good health.On July 16, Pakistan provided consular access to Jadhav, but the Indian government said the access was "neither meaningful nor credible" and he appeared visibly under stress.In New Delhi, External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava last month said Pakistan had once again exposed its "farcical" approach by denying available legal remedies to Jadhav against his death sentence which is also in contravention of the ICJ verdict, and asserted that India would explore further options in the case.Srivastava said Pakistan had blocked all the avenues for an effective remedy available to India in the case, while noting that New Delhi had so far requested consular access to Jadhav for 12 times over the past one year.The MEA spokesperson said Pakistan is not only in violation of the judgment of the ICJ, but also of its own ordinance.

There cannot be transfer of a case which had no legal basis for Bihar to get involved," Maneshinde said in a statement.At the most it would be a "Zero FIR" and transferable to Mumbai Police, he said, adding that the transfer of a case to the CBI has no legal sanctity as the Bihar police had no jurisdiction over it.Maneshinde said that as Bihar Police has no jurisdiction, this "illegal method" has been adopted."Otherwise you are interfering in the Federal Structure of our Nation in a back door manner . It touches the very root of the Federal Structure on the basis of which India became a Republic..," he said.Earlier during the day, a close associate of the CM told PTI, that Rajput's father made a plea for the CBI inquiry citing hurdles created by Mumbai Police for the investigating team of Patna Police, who are in the western metropolis to pursue inquiry into an FIR lodged on his written complaint with the Rajiv Nagar police station here.In the wake of these fast-paced developments, the apex court is scheduled to hear on August 5 the plea filed by Rhea Chakraborty who has sought transfer of an FIR, lodged against her in connection with Rajput's death, from Patna to Mumbai.Rajput, aged 34, was found hanging from the ceiling of his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14 and since then Mumbai Police has been probing the case keeping in mind various angles.

04-08-2020||New Delhi||Disburse pension to elderly on time; provide PPE, face masks to people in old age homes: SC||The Supreme Court Tuesday said pension to elderly persons should be disbursed on time and those living in old age homes across the country be provided with personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitisers and face masks during the persisting COVID-19 pandemic.The elderly are suffering and steps should be taken by the administration to attend to them whenever any request is made, the top court said. The authorities should ensure timely disbursal of pension to them and the elderly in old age homes be provided PPE kits, the top court said.A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said this while hearing a plea filed by former Union minister and senior advocate Ashwani Kumar who said that at the time of the pandemic, pension to elderly must reach them on time.Kumar told the top court that crores of elderly people are living alone and appropriate direction should be issued that pension reaches to those, who are already identified and eligible for it, on time. Senior advocate V Mohana, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that states are already making efforts in this regard and this is not an adversarial issue.When Mohana sought one week to file reply on the plea, Kumar opposed it and said urgent actions are needed in this matter.The petitioner also raised the issue of the need to provide face masks, sanitisers and PPE to the elder people to protect them from the deadly virus.The bench also dealt with another application which has sought direction for treatment of elderly for coronavirus without any discrimination.The bench, which asked the states to file their responses on the plea, said that directives passed by the apex court in December 2018 in the matter be implemented keeping in view the pandemic situation prevailing in the country.It said the copies of the applications be supplied to the states.In its December 2018 verdict, the apex court had said that statutory rights of over 10 crore elderly persons in India must be recognised and implemented.It had directed the Centre to obtain information from all states and Union Territories about the number of old age homes in each district and had also suggested a relook at the pension for the elderly to make it is more realistic.  Emphasising on the social justice aspect, the apex court had said that state is obligated to ensure that right to live with dignity, shelter and health of citizens, including the elderly, are not only protected but also enforced.It had also directed the Centre to obtain information from all the states about the medical facilities and geriatric care available to senior citizens in each districts.It had said that based on the information gathered by the Centre, a plan of action should be prepared for giving publicity to provisions of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 to make elderly aware about their constitutional and statutory rights.The apex court had pronounced the verdict on the pleas by Kumar and one Sanjeeb Panigrahi who both had raised the issues concerning the elderly.The court had noted in its 2018 order that the Centre had in 2007 fixed monthly pension of Rs 200 for persons between the age of 60-79 years and Rs 500 for those aged above 80. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disburse-pension-to-elderly-on-time-provide-ppe-face-masks-to-people-in-old-age-homes-sc-122020

04-08-2020||Chandigarh||Army asks private firms to meet its ammunition requirements for next 10 years||The Army has asked private industries to meet the annual requirement for different types of ammunition, including rifle bullets and artillery rockets, for the next 10 years. The move, however, comes with a rider that interested manufacturers will not receive any financial support for their venture.In a series of requests for information (RFI) issued on Tuesday, the Master General of Ordnance’s Branch at Army Headquarters has sought to identify prospective manufacturers for participating in the indigenous manufacture of ammunition.The types of ammunition to be manufactured include rockets for the 300mm SMERCH and 122 mm BM21 systems, 90 mm shoulder-fired rocket launcher, 155 mm, 40 mm and 20 mm rounds for artillery and air defence guns as well as 7.62 mm and 9 mm rounds for different rifles and carbine.The annual requirement projected to be sourced from the private sector varies from a few dozen rounds for systems like SMERCH rockets to about 70 lakh 7.62 mm bullets.While inviting private firms for manufacturing ammunition, the Army has also made it clear that the government will neither provide any special concessions nor any funding or investment to facilitate setting up requisite infrastructure by participating firms.The manufacturers will also be responsible to obtain necessary clearances under the Arms Act from the Ministry of Home Affairs, manufacturing licenses from the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion as well as any other permissions necessary for the manufacture of ammunition in India.Each type of ammunition has various variants or type of warhead to be used for different purposes. The Russian-origin SMERCH rockets, for example, can be equipped with cluster warhead, fuel-air explosive warhead and a high explosive fragmentation warhead. Similarly, the 7.62 mm rounds are for use in assault rifles and different types of sniper rifles.The army has approached the private industry earlier for indigenous manufacture of ammunition. While some private manufacturers are supplying certain types of ammunition, the bulk of the indigenous supply comes from the state-run Ordnance Factory Board. A large quantity, especially that of critical and specialized ammunition, continue to be imported.The shift towards the private industry to meet defence requirements is part of the government’s efforts to facilitate the development of indigenous capacity, reduce import dependence and with the long-term objective of building capacity within the industry as a robust alternative source of ammunition. The government has approved manufacturing of eight selected ammunition for Indian Army by the Indian Industry.In 2017, the government had initially identified eight types of ammunition that could be produced by the private sector. The armed forces are also identifying weapons and equipment that will be placed on the ‘negative list’ to curtail their imports and switch their procurement to indigenous sources. Later, the government also allowed domestic private companies to tie up with foreign firms that had been banned for corrupt practices to manufacture ammunition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-asks-private-firms-to-meet-its-ammunition-requirements-for-next-10-years-122016

Smokers may also already have lung disease or reduced lung capacity which would greatly increase risk of serious illness. Smoking products such as water pipes often involve the sharing of mouth pieces and hoses, which could facilitate the transmission ofCOVID-19 in communal and social settings,” said the Delhi government order.Detailing the risk factors the state said “the use of Hookah (with and without tobacco i.e. herbal hookah, water pipes and other hookah like devices) in all public places, including hotels, restaurants, eatery houses, bars, pubs and discotheques of the NCT of Delhi is strictly prohibited with immediate effect for the purpose of prevention and control of the outbreak of epidemic disease namely COVID-19.”Smokers and hookah users are more vulnerable to COVID because they are among people who could face conditions that increase oxygen needs or reduce the ability of the body to use it properly will putting them at higher risk of the consequences of bilateral viral pneumonia.Delhi has been reporting a reduced number of new cases daily and is now planning to ensure prevention of transmission by all possible routes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-first-state-to-ban-hookahs-to-prevent-covid-transmission-122009

When the disputed structure was demolished in Ayodhya in 1992, she had given up eating pledging that she would consume food only when the Ram temple construction will take place.Chaturvedi recounts that she was distressed by the violence that erupted after the disputed structure was demolished in Ayodhya and vowed she would have food only after the construction of the Ram temple with the consent of all stakeholders. Since December 6, 1992, she has been surviving on fruits and spends most of her time reciting Ramayana and chanting prayers.Chaturvedi was happy on the day when the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the temple. She sent letters congratulating the Supreme Court judges who pronounced the verdict and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. When Urmila Chaturvedi started fasting, she was 53 years old. Her relatives urged her to break the fast, but she was adamant. Chaturvedi says she wishes to go to Ayodhya and take food only after seeking blessings from Lord Ram. The construction of the Ram temple is like a rebirth for her. She says that she will go to Ayodhya after the 'Bhoomi Pujan' for Ram temple is performed and after taking bath in Sarayu river, she would break her fast. Family members have also said that they will go along with Chaturvedi to Ayodhya after 'Bhumi Pujan' is performed and would like to partake of good deeds, helping her fulfill the resolve after so many years. On receiving information that Chaturvedi had not consumed food for the last 28 years, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tweeted, "Lord Ram never disappoints his devotees whether she is mother Shabari of Treta Yuga or today's mother Urmila! Mother, Blessed is your reverence! The whole Bharatvarsh (country) salutes you! Jai Siyaram!"

If you really look, if you take a look at what's going on, especially now with all these flare-ups and nations that they were talking about,” Trump told reporters at a news conference here on Monday.As such, compared to larger countries, the US is doing much better in the fight against the coronavirus, he said.“Don't forget, we're much bigger than--other than India and China. China is having a massive flare-up right now. India has a tremendous problem. Other countries have problems,” he said in response to a question.“And I noticed that in the news, in the evening news, I never read about that. In any news, I don't read about the other countries. You're starting to see that other countries are having very big flare-ups, countries that thought they were over it, like we thought we might be over in Florida, and then all of a sudden it comes back. They do come back,” he said.The US is the worst-hit country from the pandemic with over 4.7 million cases and more than 155,000 deaths.The US, Trump said, had tested over 60 million people for coronavirus.“No other country is even close to that. We've tested 60 million people - in many cases about 50 per cent, now rapid fire, meaning five to 15 to 20-minute tests where you get the results almost immediately. Nobody has anything like that. Nobody. And I think we're just doing very well,” he said.Trump said the US is beginning to see evidence of significant progress. Nationwide, the number of positive cases has declined by nearly six per cent from the week before, and the positive test rate has also dropped from 8.7 per cent to 8 per cent over that same period of time.“Hotspots across the South and West; we have seen slow improvements from their recent weekly peaks,” he said, adding that Arizona's weekly case counts have dropped 37 per cent that is a tremendous drop and the governor and the state have done a fantastic job down 37 per cent, Texas down 18.7 per cent, and Florida 21.2 per cent drop.“As we begin to contain the virus in these states, we must focus on new flare-ups in the states where the case numbers have risen, including Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Missouri, and I think you will find that they are soon going to be very much under control,” he said.Meanwhile, 18 states continue to have very low case numbers and low test positivity rates under five per cent, including New Jersey, New York, Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland and  Massachusetts.Even in these states, however, where the virus is under control and at a very low number, Americans should continue to be vigilant, be careful in order to prevent the new hotspots from opening up, he said.“To that end, I urge all Americans to continue to socially distance, wash your hands, wear a mask when you cannot avoid crowded places and to protect the elderly very, very important, protect the elderly. It is much different....,” Trump said.It is important for all Americans to recognise that a permanent lockdown is not a viable path towards producing the results that one wants or certainly not a viable path forward and would ultimately inflict more harm than it would prevent, he said.“As we are seeing in foreign countries around the world where cases are once again surging, you have many places where we thought they were under control doing a great job, and they are doing a great job, but this is a very tough invisible enemy. Lockdowns do not prevent infection in the future. They just don't. It comes back many times...,” he said.The purpose of a lockdown is to buy time to build capacity in hospitals, learn more about the disease and develop effective treatments, he asserted.“We are doing very well with the vaccines and the therapeutic. Countries, where there have been very significant flare-ups over the last short period of time, are Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Japan, and also, as you probably heard in Hong Kong, they have had some very serious flare-ups. Japan has gone a lot of - six-fold, six-fold flareup, that's a lot, but they will get it under control,” he said.“In our current phase, we must focus on protecting those at highest risk while allowing younger and healthier Americans to resume work and school with careful precautions. Ideally, we want to open those schools. We want to open them."At the same time, we are placing an emphasis on continuing to drive down the mortality rate with improved care, treatment and medical interventions building a bridge to the introduction of a vaccine. The vaccines are coming along incredibly well,” Trump said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-doing-very-well-against-covid-india-has-a-tremendous-problem-trump-122006

However, special international charter flights, permitted by the Indian aviation regulator DGCA, have been operating as usual.India resumed domestic passenger flights from May 25 after a gap of two months due to the pandemic.

04-08-2020||Mumbai||SpiceJet to commence flight services to UK from next month||Budget carrier SpiceJet on Tuesday said it has secured slots at the London Heathrow Airport, which will allow the airline to commence flight services to the UK from next month.These slots, under the air bubble pact, will later be extended to operate regular flight services once international flight services are resumed, SpiceJet said in a regulatory filing.An air bubble is a bilateral arrangement with a set of regulations and restrictions in which the carriers of the two countries can operate international flights."SpiceJet has secured slots at London Heathrow Airport to operate flights effective September 1. This is presently under the bubble arrangement between India and UK and effective up to end of summer schedule, which is October 23," the airline said in the filing.The same shall be extended on the resumption of regular operations, it added.All international commercial air passenger services in India are suspended since March 22, in the wake of travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.However, various evacuation and charter flights are being currently operated to fly back stranded Indians in various countries and also transport foreign nationals, who are stuck in India, to their countries.SpiceJet, in the filing on Tuesday, also said that it is in "advance discussion to secure slots for the winter schedule for regular operations." The winter schedule of airlines in India commences from the last Saturday of October and lasts up to the last week of March every year."London is one of the busiest long-haul destinations from India and this is a huge milestone for SpiceJet. Providing non-stop connectivity from India to different parts of the world, which in turn strengthens our own airport hubs, is a dream that we have long cherished and this is a small step in that direction," SpiceJet Chairman & Managing Director Ajay Singh said.Singh further said "the identical arrival/departure slots that we have secured at Heathrow should suit the convenience of our passengers perfectly".On July 24, the budget carrier had announced that it was designated as "Indian scheduled carrier" to operate flight services to the UK from India.Currently, government-run Air India is the only domestic airline flying between India and the UK.It has also been allowed to operate flight services to the US under the air bubble pact.SpiceJet had been planning to operate to London since the summer of 2019 when it applied for slots to connect Amritsar-London flights.However, after it failed to get them, the budget carrier took another attempt in August for slots at London Heathrow and Manchester after the grounding of Jet Airways in April. But it could not succeed. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/spicejet-to-commence-flight-services-to-uk-from-next-month-122001
04-08-2020||Mandya||Karnataka's 85-year-old pond digger recovers from COVID-19||Karnataka's octogenarian farmer Kamegowda, whom Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised in his 'Mann ki Baat' radio programme for digging 16 ponds around his village to conserve water in Karnataka's Mandya district, recovered from COVID after 14 days of treatment at a state-run hospital here."Kamegowda, 85, is relieved to be out of the hospital and happy to be back home at his village (Dasandoddi). The district administration gave him a royal farewell with a music band after he was discharged on Monday evening," his associate K. Shivappa from nearby Malavalli town told IANS on phone.Mandya is about 100 km southwest of Bengaluru in the southern state on way to Mysuru.Though Kamegowda was reluctant to get admitted to the district hospital after he tested COVID positive at home on July 21, as he is against Allopathic medicines and his right leg was injured, he relented when an ambulance was rushed to ferry him to Mandya from his village."Kamegowda had to be cajoled and convinced that his family members too will get infected if he stayed at home and hence should shift to the hospital for treatment on July 22," Shivappa recalled.With his ecological feat drawing Modi's attention and the media carrying his achievement across the country, Kamegowda received special care and a paramedic was deputed to look after him, as he was unable to walk to the toilet or eat properly as he can't digest solid food in old age."Doctors, his son Krishna and nurses made him take gruel (ganji) and fruits to restore his health. He responded well to the COVID treatment to recover from the infection in two weeks," Shivappa pointed out.When Kamegowda reached home, the village folk cheered and honoured him for staging a remarkable recovery at his age from the dreaded disease.Mandya Deputy Commissioner M.V. Venkatesh joined the hospital staff, including district health officer H.P. Manchegowda, hospital superintendent G. Sivakumar and Mandya Institute of Medical Sciences Principal K.M. Shivakumar in sending off Kamegowda to home after discharge."It is a joy to see Kamegowda being discharged from the hospital on recovering completely from coronavirus. Special thanks to the hospital staff," said Venkatesh on the occasion.In his monthly radio programme "Mann ki baat" on June 28, Modi said with the onset of the southwest monsoon in many parts of the country, the people should practice rain-water harvesting to protect the environment, as Kamegowda was doing in Karnataka even though he was over 80 years old."Kamegowda has dug 16 ponds through his hard work. He is a simple farmer, but his personality is extraordinary. The work done by him sets him apart from others. At his age, Kamegowda takes cattle for grazing and has dug ponds in his village. When asked about his feat, he said as there was water shortage in his area, he was digging more ponds to conserve water for the people," said Modi in his nationwide address.Though ponds dug by Kamegowda may not be big, his efforts were huge, Modi had said."Kamegowda is an inspiration for the people in the country, as he has been forming water bodies over 4 decades, which have turned the Kundinibetta hillock green and provided water for drinking and farming," an official said then.The state government honoured Kamegowda with the Rajyotsava award in 2019 in recognition of his yeomen community service.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnatakas-85-year-old-pond-digger-recovers-from-covid-19-122000
04-08-2020||New Delhi||DU exams: Barely a week to go, students grapple with multiple challenges||"The situation is bad here due to floods. There is no electricity. How will I be able to take my exams?" says Rasuhan Kumar, a final-year student of Delhi University's Satyawati College on the phone from his home in Bihar's Muzaffarpur."I could not even charge my phone for two-and-a-half days since there was no electricity. Even those with internet access say they will face issues in taking the exams," he said.Kumar claimed many students were also not able to take online classes.The online open-book exams (OBE) for final year undergraduate and postgraduate students of Delhi University are scheduled to begin from August 10 and like Kumar, many others are facing connectivity issues or do not have the study material with them.They also alleged that their final semester was riddled with problems like the northeast Delhi communal violence, the Delhi University Teachers' Association (DUTA) strike and the coronavirus-induced lockdown."The university is saying that it will provide another chance to students to take exams in offline mode. But it is still unclear when they will hold the exams," another student said on condition of anonymity."Final year students also have to apply to other universities for their masters. How will we do it if we do not take online exams and wait for the offline exams? We will have to waste a year," he said.Another student said he had gone home for the mid-semester break in March when the lockdown was announced, and he did not have any study material with him."I have been stuck in my home town in Uttar Pradesh. I did not bring my study material here. It is such a big university, and they did not even make efforts to make the study material available online or arrange something so that students could study," he said."Several claims are being made about the success of online classes but many students were unable to avail their benefits," he added.During mock OBEs conducted by the university, too, students had complained of problems like server crash and inability to upload question papers. Many took to Twitter to raise the issues using hashtags like #DuAgainstOnlineExam.Pankaj Garg, a former Academic Council member, said students have flagged various issues. Many students did not even take the mock exams because they know the situation isn't conducive.In one college, 23 out of 46 students of a department flagged issues they faced during mock exams. In another college, 38 out of 52 students were unable to take online classes, said a professor who did not wish to be named.Earlier, the OBEs were scheduled to start from July 1. They were later postponed to July 10 and subsequently to August.Another student said, "We are still not sure whether the exams will finally start on August 10. It (repeated postponement) has been causing stress for students." Abha Dev Habib, a Miranda House professor, said, "students are upset and their pleas are not being heard. Even the courts have not heard their pleas. They are facing a plight similar to what migrant labourers faced during lockdown."The DUTA has been demanding cancellation of OBEs and that students be evaluated on the basis of their past performance and internal assessment. However, the university has not budged from its stand. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/du-exams-barely-a-week-to-go-students-grapple-with-multiple-challenges-121996

04-08-2020||New Delhi||Bhushan defends remarks that led to contempt proceedings||Activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan has defended his controversial statements that led to the Supreme Court initiating contempt of court proceedings against him, saying “power of contempt can’t be used to stifle bona fide criticism from citizens”.A Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra had on July 22 issued notices to Bhushan and Twitter for his tweets allegedly scandalising the judiciary. Two days later, it also decided to resume hearing in another contempt of court case against him pending since 2009. The two cases are listed for hearing on August 4 and 5.In an affidavit filed in response to the contempt notice, Bhushan questioned the top court for being a “mute spectator” during the recent Delhi riots.“When the Delhi riots were unleashed, with daily videos emerging of mobs tearing down and burning mosques, the police force systematically destroying public CCTVs, taking an active part in stone-throwing, massive firing and deaths, blockades of a hospital to prevent assistance to severely wounded Muslims, etc the Supreme Court remained a mute spectator, while Delhi burnt,” Bhushan submitted.He stood by both his tweets cited by the court and refused to tender an apology for his comments even as he expressed regret for a factual mistake.“I admit that I did not notice that the bike was on a stand and therefore wearing a helmet was not required. I therefore regret that part of my tweet. However, I stand by the remaining part of what I have stated in my tweet,” Bhushan stated in his affidavit.Bhushan had on June 29 tweeted, “CJI rides a Rs 50 lakh motorcycle belonging to a BJP leader at Raj Bhavan, Nagpur, without a mask or helmet at a time when he keeps the SC in lockdown mode denying citizens their fundamental right to access justice!”In another tweet on June 27, he had said, “When historians in future look back at the last six years to see how democracy has been destroyed in India even without a formal Emergency, they will particularly mark the role of the Supreme Court in this destruction and more particularly the role of the last four CJIs.” He cited public statements of Supreme Court Judge DY Chandrachud and former SC judges Deepak Gupta and Kurian Joseph on free speech and dissent to justify his critical remarks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhushan-defends-remarks-that-led-to-contempt-proceedings-121797

He used to carry our sewing machine to the Ramjanmabhoomi and stitch the clothes with me and my elder brother in tow,” Shankarlal (54) said on Monday.Shankarlal said for the bhoomi pujan two sets of dresses have been made — one is green, while the other is orange. “The clothes are made using soft material such as ‘makhmal’ (velvet). The green dress has been made keeping in mind the day-specific colour, while orange is considered auspicious,” he said.On Sunday, the dresses were handed over by the tailors, said Acharya Satyendra Das, the chief priest of the Ram temple. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dress-with-nine-gems-stitched-for-ram-lalla-121793

Lt General Harinder Singh, who led the Indian delegation, was asked to convey to the Chinese that the status quo ante as per April 2020 had to be restored along the LAC. The Chinese side was “uncooperative”, sources said. The Chinese stance at the meeting reflected the official line taken by the Chinese ambassador during his recent talk at the Institute of Chinese Studies. The ambassador had said Chinese troops were positioned on their side of the LAC.The process to disengage troops and pull back war-waging equipment like guns, tanks, rocket launchers and missile launchers has been stalled as the People’s Liberation Army of China has not honoured the disengagement plan. Chinese troops have not moved back from Finger-4 on the north of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-obdurate-doval-led-panel-to-chart-out-course-121728

04-08-2020||New Delhi||Jadhav can engage Pakistan lawyer: Court||A Pakistan court has allowed India to hire a lawyer to file a review petition against former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav’s conviction. “However, as things stand, an Indian lawyer may not be allowed to argue the case in Pakistan courts,” Pakistan Attorney General Khalid Javed Khan told the media.On death rowThe International Court of Justice had ordered Pakistan to reopen the case as Jadhav had been denied the right to consular accessJadhav was in 2017 sentenced to death by a Pak military court on charge of being an Indian spy engaged in subversive activitiesPak claims Jadhav twice declined to file a review petition; India says he was being coerced into making such statementsThe civilian court was to hear a plea submitted by the Pakistan Government against a military court sentencing Jadhav to death. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) had ordered Pakistan to reopen the case as Jadhav’s right to consular access had been denied.Pakistan had filed the plea on the basis of a Presidential Ordinance that allows a review of a decision of the military court in a civilian court. The ordinance was approved specifically to allow Jadhav to challenge the military court awarding him the death sentence.“The court has said that if the Indian Government wants to engage a counsel, then they should be allowed to do so,’’ said the Attorney General. “Only Pakistani lawyers entitled to practice in Pakistan will be allowed. An Indian legal representative is not an option for now. Let’s see who they engage,’’ he remarked when asked whether an Indian lawyer would be allowed.The court has set the next date of hearing on September 3, giving a month to India and Pakistan to engage on the issue. The ordinance has become a bone of contention in Pakistan politics with the Opposition accusing the Pakistan Government of trying to cut a deal with India to send Jadhav back.But the ruling party blames Nawaz Sharif, the then PM, for approaching the ICJ. “Had one party not accepted the ICJ’s jurisdiction, matters would not have come to such a pass since the case would not have been heard,” Pakistan Cabinet Minister Shireen Mazari has held.Pakistan claims that Jadhav twice declined to file a review petition. India says Jadhav’s two meetings with Indian diplomats had shown that he was under duress.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jadhav-can-engage-pakistan-lawyer-court-121744
