People familiar with the development said the Nepalese embassy in New Delhi apprised its views to the Indian government over coverage of Nepal’s political developments by the Indian channels.“We have stopped the distribution of all Indian news channels except Doordarshan,” Dinesh Subedi, the chairman of Multi-System Operator (MSO), foreign channel distributor, told reporters here.“We have halted distribution of India’s private news channels as they have aired news reports hurting Nepal’s national sentiment,” he added.The development comes after some Indian channels aired reports critical of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and his government.However, the Nepal government did not officially announce halting the telecast of the Indian news channels.Minister for Finance, Information and Communication Yuvraj Khatiwada also condemned some of the reports aired by the Indian news channels.“Nepal government condemns such acts,” Khatiwada said while responding to a question on the issue during a press meet on Thursday. “The government will seek political and legal ways against such an objectionable act,” he added.Earlier in the day, former deputy prime minister and spokesperson of the ruling Nepal Communist party Narayan Kaji Shrestha said that the Indian media “must stop the baseless propaganda” against Prime Minister Oli and his government.“The baseless propaganda by the Indian media against the Nepal government and our Prime Minister has crossed all limits. This is getting too much. Stop with the nonsense,” Shrestha said in a tweet.The India-Nepal bilateral ties came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.Later, Nepal updated the country’s political map through a Constitutional amendment, incorporating three strategically important Indian areas.India termed as “untenable” the “artificial enlargement” of the territorial claims by Nepal. India has handed over a diplomatic note to Nepal over the map issue, Nepalese media reports said.

Should this be the position, it is an utter failure of the Supreme Court administration and security,” the SCAORA resolution stated.“There was no medical staff, facilities, doctor on duty, or even an ambulance in the Supreme Court premises at the time the veteran lawyer was in need of medical assistance,” SCAORA said.It also faulted the security protocol at entry and exit gates which were not relaxed during the emergency situation due to which precious time was lost that could have been useful in providing emergency medical care to Dhingra.Demanding medical facilities to be provided to lawyers and others visiting the Supreme Court, SCAORA said the Supreme Court security should be directed to be of assistance during an emergency medical situation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/advocate-dies-on-supreme-court-campus-bar-body-demands-probe-110665

In some places, the kitchen staple was being sold at Rs 70-80 per kg.                         Tomato was available at Rs 70 per kg in Gurgaon, Gangtok, Siliguri and Raipur, while at Rs 80 per kg in Gorakhpur, Kota and Dimapur.              In producing states too, prices were ruling firm at Rs 37 per kg in Hyderabad, Rs 40 per kg in Chennai and Rs 46 per kg in Bengaluru, the data showed.Asked about rising prices, Paswan said: “Normally, prices of tomato remain high during July to September due to the lean period. The price volatility is more due to perishability of the commodity.”          The prices will come to a normal level once the supply improves, he added.                         Experts also said prices of tomato normally shoot up during the lean period and the last five year’s data show the same trend.                    Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh are states with deficit tomato production in the country. They depend on surplus producing states for supplies.                       The country produces about 19.73 million tonnes of tomato annually, while the consumption is about 11.51 million tonnes, as per the official data.

09-07-2020||New Delhi||India exploring legal options in Kulbhushan Jadhav case: MEA||India on Thursday said it was exploring legal options in the case relating to Indian death-row convict Kulbhushan Jadhav, a day after Pakistan claimed that he refused to file a review petition against his sentence by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage.“At this stage, we are assessing our legal options. We will do our utmost to protect the life of the Indian national,” Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said at an online media briefing.Jadhav, a retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017.Weeks later, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence. The ICJ, then, restrained Pakistan from executing him.In July last year, the Hague-based court ruled that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.On Wednesday, Pakistan said Jadhav refused to file an appeal in the Islamabad High Court against his conviction despite being offered the option.Hours later, India called Pakistan’s claim a “farce” and said Jadhav was “coerced” to forego his rights.     Srivastava on Wednesday said Pakistan’s claim reflected its attempt to “mask” its continuing “reticence to implement” the judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the case in “letter and spirit”.He said Pakistan is only seeking to create an “illusion of remedy” in the case, and asserted that India will do its “utmost” to protect Jadhav and ensure his safe return to India.“Pakistan’s claim that Jadhav, who is incarcerated in Pakistan’s custody, has refused to initiate review petition is a continuation of the farce that has been in play for the last four years,” Srivastava said.

In Maharashtra migrants who wanted to leave earlier have now decided to stay back as the state opened up employment opportunities,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing Maharashtra Government, told a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan which had taken suo motu cognisance of migrant workers’ plight last month. “That is a healthy thing. This reverse migration is happening because industries are opening up. Since May 1, around 3.5 lakh workers came back to work again, Mehta said, even as the top court was not satisfied with Maharashtra Government’s affidavit.“You cannot say everything is fine in the state of Maharashtra and that you are providing food and transport,” the top court said.“You (Maharashtra) have a responsibility to find out which group of migrants is getting food etc. Your affidavit says food is being provided to all migrant workers but we think it’s far from truth. File a proper affidavit. You have treated this as an adversarial litigation,” said the Bench, which also included Justice SK Kaul and Justice MR Shah.But the Solicitor General’s submission on reverse migration was supported by senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, representing Bihar.“In Bihar reverse migration is happening. Migrants want to go back to cities. Trains from Bihar to cities are full,” Kumar said.The Bench, which had earlier ordered states to arrange sending migrant workers back to their native places, posted the matter for further hearing on July 17.Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi suggested that an insurance scheme for migrant labourers should be prepared. “We also need a work plan and centralised system to rehabilitate the migrants and registration of migrants needd to be insisted upon,” he said.Reiterating its June 9 order fixing a 15-day deadline for sending migrant workers back home, the Supreme Court had on June 19 asked the Centre, states and union territories to ensure compliance.The top court had said it should be ensured that no migrant had to pay anything to reach home.It asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to speak to all states, UTs to ensure compliance with its order and to give it due publicity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/migrant-workers-want-to-return-to-cities-sc-told-110660

She had also directed the police to firmly deal with those violating the norms.Police personnel were seen patrolling the streets in the containment zones and asking pedestrians to return home and shopkeepers to down shutters.Barricades have been put up outside such zones to stop vehicular movement.Ahead of the lockdown, people resorted to panic-buying in several areas disregarding social distancing norms, the officials said, adding that long queues were witnessed outside grocery stores and LPG outlets.Police resorted to using mild force in some places to ensure that safety protocols were adhered to, besides asking people through public address systems to remain indoors.The state government has said that it will make arrangements for home delivery of essential commodities during the lockdown.West Bengal had on Wednesday registered the highest single-day spike of 986 COVID-19 cases, taking the state’s coronavirus tally to 24,823.

PM Cares is one such fund with voluntary donations. The mere existence of a statutory fund would not prohibit in the creation of a different fund like PM CARES Fund which provides for voluntary donations."To the petitioner's demand for transfer of money from PM CARES Fund to NDRF account, the MHA said such a prayer was not maintainable under Article 32 of the Constitution "as all funds other than the funds stipulated under Section 46 of Disaster Management Act, 2005, are separate, different and distinct created under separate provisions."The MHA affidavit also questioned the petitioner's motive behind filing the PIL, saying it had been only dealing with filing PILs since the concept of PIL originated. An empowered group formed by the government was working closely with 92,000 genuine NGOs across India to chart out the best course of the response, it submitted.To petitioner's demand for preparing a national plan in consultation with the state governments and experts, the MHA said, currently, there was no such national plan in place to deal with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic even though the same had been notified as a ‘disaster’ and numerous notifications are being issued to contain the same under the DM Act.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-defends-pm-cares-fund-in-sc-110656

After detecting the smuggled gold, the Customs department was of the view that it suspected a smuggling syndicate behind the act, which misused the name of a person, who enjoys diplomatic immunity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/national-investigation-agency-to-probe-kerala-gold-smuggling-scam-110649

It had also said how EAM S Jaishankar was getting invited to prestigious European conferences to suggest the interest between EU and India was mutual.     The preparations for the long-due summit had begun last month with a virtual meeting between Jaishankar and the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell during which they had also discussed other topics including Afghanistan, China and Iran.The video conference was a follow-up of earlier calls by Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen to PM Modi.PM Modi was to travel to Brussels for the summit on March 13.The summit was not held for over two years due to a stalemate on talks for a free trade agreement (FTA). New Delhi was keen to tap the EU for higher technology as well as stave off criticism over Kashmir and Citizenship Amendment Act by positioning itself for greater intensity in EU-India ties. After the Covid pandemic, the EU urgently needs a step in trade which could thaw the freeze in talks on a FTA.Jaishankar had spoken about “Westlessness and Multilateralism’’ at the Munich Security Conference in which he highlighted the global political rebalancing underway and made a case for greater Western flexibility.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-to-hold-virtual-summit-with-eu-next-week-110646

The foreigners have not been arrested yet and are residing at various places approved by the Delhi High Court.At least 9,000 people, including the foreign nationals participated in the religious, Tablighi Jamaat, congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz. Later, many of the attendees travelled to various parts of the country.An FIR was registered against Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad Kandhalvi and six others on March 31 on a complaint of the Station House Officer of Nizamuddin under sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act (2005), Foreigners Act and other relevant sections of Indian Penal Code.Kandhalvi was later booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder after some of the attendees of the religious congregation died due to COVID-19, police said.

09-07-2020||---||China's claims on Galwan Valley exaggerated: India||New Delhi, July 9Terming China’s claims on the Galwan valley as exaggerated and untenable, India on Thursday said it was necessary to ensure at the earliest complete disengagement of the troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as well as de-escalation in the depth areas.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) took on its Chinese counterpart who had quoted his Foreign Minister and Special Representative (SR) for Border Affairs Wang Yi as saying the right and wrong of what happened in the Galwan valley was “very clear’’. Simultaneously, Beijing had sought to imply that it has ownership over the Galwan valley where 20 Indian soldiers died in a clash with Chinese troops on June 15.At the same time, the MEA said it was hopeful that dialogue between diplomatic and military officials of both sides will take forward the process of disengagement and de-escalation as agreed to by the SRs. A vital role will be played by the next meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China border affairs (WMCC) which will be held soon.Addressing a press conference, MEA spokesperson Anurag Shrivastava said India’s SR, NSA Ajit Doval had categorically conveyed India’s position on the recent developments along the LAC, including in the Galwan valley area. “The NSA emphasised in this context that the Indian troops had always taken a very responsible approach towards border management. And at the same time, our forces were deeply committed to ensuring India’s sovereignty and security,’’ he added, implying that Doval had indicated that Indians were in a defensive and reactive mode.  During their conversation, the two SRs agreed that peace and tranquility in border areas were essential for the overall development of bilateral relations. In this regard, Shrivastava reminded that they also shared the view that it was necessary to ensure at the earliest complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC and de-escalation in the India-China border areas for full restoration of peace and tranquility in accordance with the bilateral agreements and protocols.One of the key provisions of these bilateral agreements is the commitment by two sides to strictly respect and observe the LAC, he said while refuting “some inaccurate and uninformed comments about the disengagement process and its implications’’ which included “exaggerated and untenable’’ recent Chinese claims to the Galwan valley area.The MEA also reiterated that it was “convinced” of the need to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas and resolve differences through dialogue. At the same time, “we are also strongly committed to ensuring India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,’’ it reminded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinas-claims-on-galwan-valley-exaggerated-india-110641

09-07-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Many mentally ill homeless institutionalised, traceable, why need ID proof to test: HC||The Delhi High Court on Thursday told the ICMR and AAP government that many homeless mental ill persons are institutionalised or in shelter homes and therefore, traceable, so there was no need for their identity proof or phone numbers to test them for COVID-19.A Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said “we should not miss out these people” and the mentally ill homeless persons on the streets also “should be looked after”.It asked Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, who appeared for the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), to consult its officials on what can be done to address this aspect.“Once addressed it should also be communicated to all the hospitals,” the Bench said and gave the ICMR time till July 24 to find a solution and inform the court by way of an affidavit.The order came after the Institute for Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS), represented by advocate Tushar Sannu, told the court there were two hurdles in testing the mentally ill persons admitted with it.Sannu said that according to the ICMR advisory of June 19 every person who was to be tested for COVID-19 has to provide a government issued identity proof and should have a valid phone number for tracing and tracking the individual and his/her contacts.He said that the majority of the mentally ill persons would not be able to satisfy either of these conditions and therefore, they cannot be tested for COVID-19.IHBAS has suggested that the ICMR guidelines be suitably modified to address the hardship faced by the mentally ill homeless persons.The high court was hearing a PIL by lawyer Gaurav Kumar Bansal  seeking directions to ICMR and Delhi Government to issue guidelines for COVID-19 testing of mentally ill homeless persons in the national capital.In its response to the plea, ICMR has said that in its advisory dated June 23, point of care diagnostic assay in combination with gold standard RT/PCR test is recommended for persons with neurological disorders, whether hospitalised, seeking hospitalisation or residing in hotspot areas.Besides that, the advisory also suggests sero-survey by ELISA test of people staying or working in slums with very high population density with poorly ventilated buildings or structures and those persons staying in institutional settings like old age homes, orphanage, asylums and shelters for the homeless, ICMR has said.Delhi Government, in its affidavit, has said that it was adhering to the ICMR advisory of June 19 which mandates that all patients being tested by any method must furnish one government-issued photo identity proof and a mobile number.It also said that “in the absence of any specific guidelines or rules for the testing of homeless mentally ill or suspected mentally ill persons, the Delhi Government was trying its best to do all that is necessary for the homeless persons”.IHBAS has also filed an affidavit, through Sannu, giving details of steps taken by it to look after the mentally ill homeless persons.It has said that it has taken in all those mentally ill persons, having flu-like symptoms, who are awaiting COVID-19 test results and has “placed them in isolation rooms in its private ward complex as per National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) norms”.“However, the number of such patients kept increasing and there was a need for larger facility for accommodation of such persons,” it has said.Besides that, it has also “started a Preventive Isolation Facility (PIF) in the first floor of its psychiatry block (separate entry and exit) wherein 8 rooms with attached washrooms were available with requisite precaution and safety in compliance of all guidelines”.It has further said that capacity of the PIF has been expanded to 16 beds.IHBAS has said that all patients, including the homeless destitute persons with mental illness or suspected mental illness, are being admitted since April 24 and those testing positive for COVID-19 are being shifted to designated COVID hospitals with all precautions and safety measures.

09-07-2020||New Delhi||Code on Wages likely to be implemented by Sept; Labour Ministry circulates draft rules||The Code on Wages, 2019, the first law under labour reforms, is likely to be implemented by September as the Ministry of Labour and Employment has put draft rules of the law in public domain for feedback, a senior official said.Parliament in August last year approved the code to enable introduction of a minimum wage for every worker besides addressing issues like delay in payment to employees.The Labour Ministry has put the draft rules issued on July 7 in the official gazette.“The draft rules on the Code would be open for public feedback for 45 days from July 7, 2019, the day when the Labour Ministry notified those in the gazette. If everything goes well then the draft rules would be implemented by September after taking into consideration public comments,” a senior Labour Ministry official told PTI. Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar at the time of passage of the code had asserted in Parliament that it will benefit about 50 crore workers in the country.The Code on Wages Bill, 2019, seeks to amend and consolidate laws relating to wages, bonus and matters connected therewith. It was passed in Rajya Sabha on August 2, 2019. Lok Sabha passed theh bill on July 30, 2019. The Code will subsume four labour laws—Minimum Wages Act, Payment of Wages Act, Payment of Bonus Act and Equal Remuneration Act. After its enactment, all these four Acts would be repealed.The Code universalised the provision of minimum wages and timely payment of wages to all employees irrespective of the sector and wage ceiling, he said.  At present, the provisions of both Minimum Wages Act and Payment of Wages Act apply on workers below a particular wage ceiling working in Scheduled Employments only.There are 12 definitions of wages in different labour laws leading to litigation besides difficulty in implementation. The definition has been simplified in the Code and is expected to reduce litigation and also reduce compliance cost for employers.The Code will effectively address the problems relating to delay in payment of wages whether on monthly, weekly or daily basis. The Code will ensure that there is no discrimination between male and female as well as transgenders in getting wages.The draft rules provide for eight hours working day under the Code of Wages. Thus there is no change in the working hours provision as provided under the Factory Act. There were apprehensions that the working hours may be increased. During lockdown some states had taken the decision to increase the working hours to make up for the production loss.The Code provides that the floor wage will be computed based on minimum living conditions which would benefit about 50 crore workers across the country.As per the draft rules, a central advisory board would fix the floor level minimum wages taking into account the minimum living standard including the food, clothing, housing and any other factors considered by the government.The Code on Wages is part of labour reforms and the first law under the central government’s initiative which would be implemented.The central government has been working to concise 44 central labour laws into four broad codes on wages, industrial relations, social security and occupational health & safety (OCH).The Industrial Relations Code, 2019, The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2019, and The Code on Social Security, 2019 were introduced in Lok Sabha last year and sent for scrutiny by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour. The panel had submitted reports on codes on industrial relations and OCH. The report on social security code is awaited.

Sector-wise demonstrations will be held at state capitals, district headquarters, tehsil/block centres and also in all big industrial estates,” said a senior BMS functionary on Wednesday.The office-bearers during the meeting, made a note of the recent successful three-day strike by workers in the coal sector. The leaders expressed concerns, broadly on five issues including problems of workers in the unorganised sector particularly migrant workers, and non-payment of wages and large scale job losses.Suspension of labour laws and increasing working hours in 12 BJP and non-BJP ruled states during the COVID-19 pandemic have not gone down well with BMS. It was decided to face-off with these governments during the proposed campaign.The meeting also criticised the government’s action of “unbridled” privatisation by selling PSUs and also through corporatisation of defence and railway production units.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-affiliate-bharatiya-mazdoor-sangh-calls-for-nationwide-campaign-against-govt-110620
09-07-2020||New Delhi||Examination process nerve wracking, students’ career at stake: HC to DU on postponing exams||Examinations are nerve- wracking and career of thousands of students is at stake, the Delhi High Court said on Thursday, pulling up the Delhi University for repeatedly postponing the exams of final year undergraduate courses in the last few weeks.The court questioned the varsity on pushing the exams from July 10 to a date beyond August 15, even when it kept maintaining that it was ready to conduct the Open Book Examinations (OBE) on July 1 as well as on July 10.A Bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad directed Delhi University to file an affidavit detailing the schedule of final year undergraduate exams which have been postponed from July 10 to beyond August 15 in view of persisting COVID-19 pandemic.The high court also asked the varsity to explain in the affidavit as to how it proposes to conduct exams—online, offline or both modes, besides the complete date sheet, providing clarity to students.It allowed the prayer of senior advocate Sachin Dutta, representing DU, to grant some time as they have to work out a new plan in terms of July 8 circular issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC) for declaring the manner in which the forthcoming exams are to be conducted.The court directed the DU to file the affidavit by July 13 and listed the matter for consideration on July 14.“We all have gone through the examination process which is nerve-wracking for the students, especially during the times of COVID-19 pandemic,” said the Bench, which was conducting the hearing through video conferencing.“Why are you pushing the exams to a date beyond August 15, knowing that careers of thousands of students are at stake,” the court said, adding that the final year students have to be given passing out certificates and degrees to enable them to pursue higher education.It asked the varsity to mull over the schedule given by the UGC and come back with a firm date sheet and examination schedule.The court was also critical of the way mock exams were conducted by the DU and referred to technical glitches during the tests.The Bench did not appreciate the conduct of the varsity which has been “turning turtle” and changing stands frequently.It noted that on June 26, DU informed the court that it will go ahead with conducting exams from July 1 and after less than 24 hours, the university postponed the exams to July 10.The court had on June 29 issued notice to the varsity asking why contempt proceedings be not initiated against it and its officers for trying to mislead the court by withholding information on deferment of the online OBE from July 1 to July 10.The court was then informed that the university was firm on commencing exams from July 10.“We took you (DU) on face value and asked you to file an affidavit for clarity. Now we discover you have again changed the date to beyond August 15 and there is no exact date. What do you expect us to do. You want us to constantly monitor you on conducting exams,” the Bench said.It added, “Sorry to say the way the university is conducting itself for the last few weeks, we are not impressed with anything. We have to take it with a pinch of salt.”            In the affidavit filed by DU on Thursday morning, it was averred that meeting of a High Powered Committed of the university took place on July 7 at 9:30 pm to access the exam related matters and taking stalk of the developments pursuant to revised guidelines issued by UGC on July 6.Thereafter, the DU has decided to postpone holding of the examination to some date after August 15.Dutta said the university is still working upon the date sheet for the examination to be conducted after August 15.During the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing the UGC, informed the court that on July 6 and July 8, it has issued a circular/ guidelines to all the universities informing them that the examination process for final year students must be completed by the end of September and the mode of conducting examination could be online, offline or a blend of both the methods.On being asked by the court as to whether the UGC has insisted that exams be conducted for promoting students, Mehta said exams are compulsory for final year students and the process has to be completed by September 30.The high court was hearing various petitions by several final year DU students seeking quashing and withdrawal of the notifications of May 14, May 30 and June 27 for online exams for undergraduate and postgraduate students, including of the School of Open Learning and Non-Collegiate Women Education Board.As an alternative prayer, one of the petitions has sought direction to the DU to evaluate the final year students based on the previous years’ or semesters’ results in the same manner as the university has planned to promote the first and second year students.

09-07-2020||New Delhi/Berne||Swiss govt issues public notices on sharing of bank details of Congress leader Kuldeep Bishnoi, wife||The Switzerland Government has issued public notices on sharing of details with India about Swiss bank accounts and other financial assets of Congress leader Kuldeep Bishnoi and his wife Renuka following receipt of an ‘administrative assistance’ request from the Indian authorities.The Bishnois have been asked to reply within ten days to exercise their right to appeal against sharing of information as per the Swiss laws, according to two separate notices published in Switzerland’s latest federal gazette, dated July 7, in Berne.Similar notices have also been issued for Grande Maison Ltd and Hollyport Ltd—two British Virgin Islands-based companies suspected to have links with the Bishnoi family.Both the companies were incorporated on the same day on July 19, 1996, and also figured in ‘Panama Papers’, a leaked list of entities based in various tax havens. As per official records, both the companies were struck off from the registry of companies in April 2016 after remaining inactive since August 2014.Repeated queries sent by PTI to Bishnoi, a sitting MLA in the Haryana Assembly, and his office remained unanswered.In the notices, Bishnoi, his wife and the two firms were asked to appoint a representative within 10 days to assert their right to be heard against the ‘administrative assistance’ proposed by Switzerland’s Federal Tax Administration.Such assistance includes sharing of banking and other details of the individual or the company having accounts with banks or other financial institutions in Switzerland.While the notices did not disclose any specific details about the probe, such notices are typically issued by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration after receipt of a request by a foreign jurisdiction along with prima facie evidence of suspected tax evasion or other financial wrongdoings.If the concerned person or company fails to provide a valid reason against the administrative assistance, the details are subsequently shared by the tax department with the requesting authority.While an automatic exchange of information framework is in place between India and Switzerland since last year, sharing of details for older cases also takes place under the mutual ‘administrative assistance’ pact between the two countries on submission of a request along with satisfactory prima-facie evidence of financial wrongdoings.Bishnoi has been facing probe by multiple agencies including the Income Tax Department, which had conducted raids at various places linked to him in July last year.The tax department had also attached a five-star hotel in a prime business area of Gurugram, while designating that as a ‘benami’ or unaccounted property of the Bishnoi family. It was alleged at that time that the shareholding in the hotel was routed through a front entity registered in British Virgin Islands.The tax department had also said in August 2019 that foreign assets worth over Rs 200 crore allegedly linked to Bishnoi and his family were detected and were being probed.At that time, the Congress party had alleged that the tax department’s move was politically motivated ahead of assembly elections in the state.Bishnoi, son of former Haryana Chief Minister Bhajan Lal, eventually won the election from the state’s Adampur assembly seat in October 2019.The tax department had also said that foreign holdings of Bishnoi and his family had “remained hidden for decades” under complex multi-layered structures through companies located in countries like the British Virgin Islands, Panama, UK, UAE and Jersey.“These structures have involved various front men and corporations across continents,” it had said, while alleging that the black money generated in India was stashed abroad in the form of lavish properties in the names of foreign trusts and companies located in tax havens.

09-07-2020||New Delhi||Covid-19 situation in Delhi shows ‘remarkable’ improvement: MHA||With a recovery rate of over 72 per cent and doubling rate of nearly 30 days, the COVID-19 situation in the national capital has shown remarkable improvement in recent days because of joint efforts, the Union Home Ministry said Thursday.Addressing a press conference, Home Ministry Joint Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava said the ministry has been holding regular meetings with the state governments in the Delhi-NCR region for improving the pandemic situation.She said in these meetings, national-level experts also participate and some important decisions have been taken.These include controlling the cost of COVID treatment in private hospitals, arrangement of additional beds in the national capital, increasing the number of tests using rapid antigen technology, careful demarcation of containment zones, contact tracing of all affected persons, effective use of Information Technology systems and AIIMS Delhi consultancy telemedicine facility now available to all COVID hospitals in the country for clinical management of the disease.“Joint efforts have improved the situation in Delhi. Rapid antigen technology is being used at a large scale which has increased testing capability,” she said.“Till July 8, over 6.79 lakh tests have been done which translates into 35,780 tests per million population. Now every day over 20,000 tests are being done but in spite of increase in tests, active cases are under control,” Srivastava said.The official said as on Thursday, there were 23,552 active cases in Delhi that has a recovery rate of about 72 per cent and the doubling rate has increased to 29.7 days (or about 30 days).She said the number of hospital beds available for COVID care in Delhi have been increased.“On June 1, there were 4,456 hospital beds available. Now 15,096 beds are available. On July 8, there were 10,237 vacant beds which is about 68 percent of the availability,” she said.Srivastava said the Sardar Patel COVID care centre at Chattarpur here has emerged as a game changer as provision of a good facility for Delhi residents was ensured within 12 days, setting an example for the entire country.She said Unlock 2.0 directions have been implemented from July 1 and stage-wise permission was being given for activities being allowed outside containment zones.However, the lockdown will be strictly followed in containment zones till July 31.“Now all economic activities are permitted. Complying with national directives has become paramount like masks, social distancing, etc,” she said, adding that the ministry is keeping a close watch on the implementation of the national directives.

09-07-2020||Beijing||Chinese, Indian troops have taken ‘effective measures’ to disengage along LAC: China||China on Thursday said Chinese and Indian troops have taken “effective measures” to disengage at the Galwan Valley and other areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and the situation is “stable and improving,” days after the two sides agreed on an expeditious withdrawal of soldiers from all the standoff points.The remarks by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian came a day after people in New Delhi familiar with the developments said that the Chinese military removed all temporary structures and completed withdrawal of its troops from the face-off site in Hot Springs in eastern Ladakh.Zhao told a media briefing here that “following the consensus reached at the commander-level talks, China, India border troops have taken effective measures to disengage at the front-line at the Galwan Valley and other areas.” “The situation along the border is stable and improving,” he said.Asked about further talks between the two countries, Zhao said the two sides will continue dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels including by holding meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultations and Coordination (WMCC) on the Sino-Indian border affairs.“We hope India will work together with us to take concrete action and implement the consensus reached and jointly work for de-escalation along the border,” the spokesman added.The disengagement process of the troops on both sides began on Monday morning after a nearly two-hour telephonic conversation between National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday.At the talks, the two sides agreed on an expeditious withdrawal of troops from all the standoff points to bring back peace and tranquility in the region. Doval and Wang are Special Representatives (SR) for the boundary talks.In New Delhi, the people familiar with the developments said that the two armies are expected to carry out a joint verification in the next few days to assess the implementation of the disengagement process once the dismantling of the temporary infrastructure and withdrawal of troops by China are completed at the friction points along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.There has been thinning out of troops from Finger areas in Pangong Tso as well, they said. Pangong Tso has been a major face-off site between the two sides.The two militaries are set to hold extensive talks on finalising modalities for restoring normalcy and bringing back peace and tranquillity in the region after the verification of the disengagement exercise is completed, they added.Government sources in New Delhi said the Chinese military has already removed tents and withdrew its personnel from patrolling point 14 in Galwan Valley, the site of violent clashes between the two armies on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.

09-07-2020||New Delhi||87-yr-old woman, her nonagenarian husband defeat COVID-19||An octogenarian woman in Delhi and her 90-year-old husband suffering from Alzheimer's disease have recovered from the coronavirus infection and discharged from hospital.Doctors at a city hospital where the elderly couple were treated said that their recovery from COVID-19 in the face of high mortality rate in the older population globally due to the infection was a ray of hope to other patients.On May 25, the 87-year-old woman was rushed to the hospital after fracturing her hip, and she was advised immediate hip replacement surgery.Before the surgery, she was tested for COVID-19 and was found positive. Following this, her family too underwent tests and her husband was found to have contracted the viral disease.The couple was initially admitted to Indraprastha Apollo Hospital under the supervision of Dr Nikhil Modi, Senior Consultant of Respiratory, Critical Care and Sleep Disorder, Institute of Critical Care. Their vitals were regularly monitored, provided the required line of treatment and they made remarkable improvement within the first 10 days.As soon as the woman tested negative, Dr Yatinder Kharbanda, senior consultant and orthopaedic surgeon, performed a successful total hip replacement procedure."People who are at an advanced age and have multiple comorbidities are the ones under maximum threat of COVID-19. Their immune system gets degraded so much over the years that they become more vulnerable to infectious diseases," he said.Also, due to pre-existing conditions like heart disease, geriatric syndrome (fall frailty, dementia and impaired mobility), lung ailments, diabetes or kidney disease their body's ability to fight infectious diseases weakens with time."In this case, the elderly woman was facing a lot of difficulties due to her fractured hip. We put her in traction with heavy bouts of cough and clogged throat. A team of doctors and nurses worked hard to provide medical care," said Dr Modi.The team in the critical care unit was kept on standby in case any complication arose."Simultaneously, though her husband had mild symptoms, but given his age and multiple comorbidities, it was important for us to monitor his condition every minute," he said.Dr Kharbanda said, "Multiple health challenges pose a great risk to patient's life. In such cases, patients can undergo a lot of trauma and shock which might affect the recovery process."      But defying all odds, the couple was discharged from the hospital on June 22.

09-07-2020||New Delhi||Amid Covid, LAC tension, PM Modi rolls out ‘red carpet’ for global investors||Wooing global companies, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said his government’s self-reliant India campaign is not about being closed to the world and Asia’s third-largest economy continues to be one of the most open in the world that offers investment-friendly and competitive business environment.Speaking at the India Global Week 2020, he said Aatmanirbhar Bharat, or self-reliant India, is “not about being self-contained or being closed to the world.”                “It is about being self-sustaining and self-generating. We will pursue policies that promote efficiency, equity and resilience,” he said.In response to the biggest economic crisis since 1979 triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown – one of the harshest in the world, the government announced a Rs 20.97 lakh crore fiscal relief package that encompassed free ration and cash to poor and structural reforms with a call to boost domestic capabilities so as to cut imports.“India remains one of the most open economies in the world. We are laying a red carpet for all global companies to come and establish their presence in India. Very few countries will offer the kind of opportunities India does today,” Modi said in his address through video link.Sectors such as agriculture, defence, and space have been opened up for investments.“We are making the economy more productive, investment-friendly and competitive,” he said citing deep structural reforms undertaken during the pandemic.With reforms and calibrated opening of the economy, green shoots of revival are already visible. “In India, we are already seeing green-shoots when it comes to economic recovery,” he said.While the COVID relief package used technology to deliver benefits directly to needy, the government launched one of the world’s largest public works programmes to provide employment to millions of workers as soon as lockdown restrictions were eased.“This will not only re-energise the rural economy but also help in creation of a durable infrastructure in the rural areas,” he said.He cited reforms in micro, small and medium enterprises as well as relaxation of foreign investment norms in the defence sector and opening up of commercial space technology for private investment.“There are investment opportunities in the defence sector. With relaxed FDI norms, one of the world’s biggest militaries invites you to come and make products for it,” he said. “Now, there are more opportunities for private investment in the space sector.”    Also, reforms in agriculture provide a very attractive investment opportunity to invest in storage and logistics.“We are opening the doors to investors to come and invest directly in the hard work of our farmers,” he said. “There are many possibilities and opportunities in various sunrise sectors in India.”                 Modi said it was natural to link global economic revival with India, as “there is faith that the story of global revival will have India playing a leading role.”        The combination of talent and the country’s ability to reform and rejuvenate are factors for this thought.“Indians are natural reformers! History has shown that India has overcome every challenge, be it social or economical. India has done so with a spirit of reform and rejuvenation. The same spirit continues now,” he said adding the country talks of revival that is caring, compassionate, and sustainable.The Prime Minister cited reforms of the past six years including the rollout of GST to state that the gains from them have set the foundations for the next round of development initiatives.The pandemic, he said, has once again shown that India’s pharma industry is an asset not just for India but for the entire world.“It has played a leading role in reducing the cost of medicines, especially for developing countries. Vaccines made in India are responsible for two-thirds of the vaccination needs of the world’s children,” he said adding Indian companies are active in the international efforts for development and production of the COVID-19 vaccine.“I am certain that India will have an important role in developing and in scaling-up production of the vaccine once it is discovered,” he said.India, he said, is ready to do whatever it can to further global good and prosperity.“This is an India that is reforming, performing, and transforming.

09-07-2020||New Delhi||Let’s leave politics out of education: HRD Minister on syllabi exclusions||HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on Thursday rose in defence of CBSE’s syllabi rationalisation for classes 9 to 12 given the COVID pandemic. He urged everyone to leave politics out of education and stop spinning a “false narrative.”Pokhriyal was reacting after educationists and opposition politicians slammed the CBSE wielding a knife on key and controversial topics— secularism, federalism, nationalism and citizenship among others— while rationalising the syllabi for higher classes.Many educationists have termed the syllabi reductions by CBSE as motivated and demanded a recall.“There has been a lot of uninformed commentary on the exclusion of some topics from CBSE syllabus. The problem with these comments is that they resort to sensationalism by connecting topics selectively to portray a false narrative,” Pokhriyal said, adding that education is a sacred duty towards children and it should be spared of politics.“Let us leave politics out of education and make our politics more educated,” was the Minister’s defence after top educationists like Anita Rampal questioned the rationale behind the reductions.Pokhriyal said CBSE has clarified that schools have been advised tofollow the NCERT Alternate Academic Calendar and all the topics mentioned have been covered under the same Academic Calendar.The exclusions are merely a one-time measure for exams, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Minister reiterated.He said the sole only aim was to ease the stress on students by reducing the syllabus by 30 per cent.“This exercise has been carried out following the advice and recommendations of various experts and considering the suggestions received from educationists through our syllabus for students 2020 campaign,” Pokhriyal said.Adviser to NCERT Prof Subhash had on Wednesday said he wasn’t aware of the move to rationalise until it happened.The minister added: “While it is easy to misconstrue exclusion of topics like nationalism, local government, federalism, etc and build a concocted narrative, a wider perusal of different subjects will show that this exclusion is happening across subjects. To give a few examples, the topics excluded in Economics are Measures of Dispersion, Balance of Payments Deficit, etc, topics excluded in Physics are Heat Engine & Refrigerator, Heat Transfer, Convection & Radiation among others.Similarly, some of the excluded topics in Maths are Properties of Determinants, Consistency, Inconsistency, and Number of Solutions of System of Linear Equations by Examples and Binomial Probability Distribution.In Biology, portions of Mineral Nutrition, Digestion & Absorption have been excluded. It can be no one’s argument that these topics have also being excluded by malice or some grand design which only partisan minds can decipher,” Pokhriyal said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lets-leave-politics-out-of-education-hrd-minister-on-syllabi-exclusions-110581

09-07-2020||Lucknow||'Yes, I am Vikas Dubey from Kanpur';  here is how gangster was arrested||Uttar Pradesh's dreaded gangster Vikas Dubey, who has had a thing for Bollywood, on Thursday surrendered over a thousand kilometres away from what could be his swan song of a criminal life in the Mahakaal temple premises of Madhya Pradesh's Ujjain as he announced in Sanjay Dutt's "Khalnayak" style: "Mein huin Vikas Dubey, Kanpurwala".Dubey has been on the run for almost a week, ever since the ambush and killing of eight police personnel in Kanpur. As police searched for him in Haryana, Delhi, and kept a close watch on Indo-Nepal border, the Kanpur boy who had launched himself into crime in the 1990s in the image of Sunny Deol's "Arjun Pandit" and loved the sound of being addressed to as "Pandit" in political and police circles, managed to dodge the bullet as he was nabbed in the safe grounds of the temple complex.According to sources, Vikas reached the temple around 8.a.m and then informed the security men about his identity and asked them to inform the police.In a photograph that has gone viral, shows Dubey sitting comfortably on a sofa inside the temple complex.Uttar Pradesh Police officially confirmed the arrest of Vikas Dubey. Madhya Pradesh Home minister Narottam Mishra tried took credit for the gangster's arrest. Speaking to the media minutes after Dubey was whisked away to an unidentified location for medical examination and questioning, Mishra said: "Hamari police kisi ko nahin chhodti. Hamare jaanbaaz police jawanon ne usey dhar dabocha (Our police never lets any criminal go scott free. They have nabbed him)."Mishra said the details of his arrest and related process would be made public by the police later. Mishra said Dubey has been known to be "cruel and crafty" from childhood. The police had to be extra cautious.Mishra said the police was alerted by the intelligence agencies. Video clips released by various channels showed Vikas Dubey being held by the scruff of his collar by the police, shouting, "Haan main Vikas Dubey hoon Kanpur wala (Yes I am Vikas Dubey from Kanpur)".Everything points to Vikas having travelled all the way from Faridabad to the high security zone of Mahakaal to avoid a death in police encounter. In the secure premises of Mahakaal temple he could avoid extra judicial justice. Two of his alleged gang members were also said to have been arrested.The Madhya Pradesh police has taken the gangster away to the Mahakaal police station and the UP police will now seek transit remand and bring him to Kanpur.The police theory of the arrest, meanwhile, has several loopholes.Temple officials admit on condition of anonymity, that Vikas Dubey disclosed his name at the counter where he was giving money for donation and then asked them to inform the police.Dubey apparently di not use any disguise to evade the police and neither did he have any arms since weapons are prohibited in the temple complex."This is a pre-planned surrender because it seems too simple to be true. Vikas had successfully eluded the police in three states for one week and it is rather unusual that he would enter a temple without a mask and get arrested. He knew that he would be shot dead if he gave himself up to UP police," said a retired DGP.Another senior police official admitted that the arrest/ surrender seems extremely well planned."The gangster wanted to surrender in a 'safe state'. He did not go to court because of police presence and, therefore, chose the temple. Unless the police decide to make another mistake, Vikas Dubey will not be harmed physically now," he said.Dubey had been eluding the police since the past one week and though four dozen teams of Special Task Force and state police were chasing him, they could not nab him.Five associates of Vikas Dubey have been shot dead in UP after the killing of eight policemen last week.Two of his associates, Prem Prakash Pandey and Atul Dubey were shot dead on Friday, hours after the massacre. Amar Dubey was shot dead on Wednesday in Hamirpur and Prabhat and Bauan Dubey were shot dead in Kanpur and Etawah respectively on Thursday morning.All of them were reportedly involved in the shootout.Dubey's arrest is a major setback to the UP Special Task Force that failed to nail the gangster. The STF, which had been claiming till late on Wednesday that Dubey was hiding in Delhi-NCR, was blissfully unaware that he had moved across to Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh. There is a distance of 773 kilometres from Faridabad where Dubey was reportedly seen last on Tuesday and Ujjain where he finally 'surrendered'.The STF, which has killed five accomplices of Vikas Dubey in the past seven days, has put out a strikingly similar theory for all the encounters - "we tried to stop them, they opened fire and were killed in retaliatory firing".IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yes-i-am-vikas-dubey-from-kanpur-here-is-how-gangster-was-arrested-110576
09-07-2020||New Delhi||Finance Ministry asks states to ensure safety of bankers, take stern action against unruly||The Finance Ministry has requested states to ensure safety and security of bank officials and take stern action against perpetrators following incidences of attack on bankers in some parts of the country in the recent past.The Department of Financial Services, in a letter to chief secretary of states, said that incidences of unruly behaviour of anti-social elements against the bankers needs to be responded with stern action taken against such elements, sources said.Last month, a woman bank employee in Canara Bank (erstwhile Syndicate Bank) was attacked by a police constable at its Saroli branch in Surat, Gujarat. Following the incident, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had assured that the safety of all members of staff in banks is of importance."Amid challenges, banks are extending all services to our people. Nothing should threaten their safety and dignity," she had said.A few incidents, including attack on Bank of India staff in Maharashtra, were reported after the Surat attack.Citing recent news reports and social media coverage, the letter said it had highlighted instances of anti-social elements behaving in an unruly manner with bankers within bank premises."You would agree that such incidents need to be responded to proactively and with a firm hand, stern action taken against such elements with full force of law so that bankers are protected and the public assured of secured access to banking services," the letter dated July 7 said.Securing the availability of banking services to the public at all times is essential for households to meet their expenses and access benefits through DBT and for traders, farmers industries, etc, to carry on economic activities.Delivery of essential services, including banking, is all the more important in the present context of the Covid-19 pandemic, it emphasised."...I request to appropriately sensitise and instruct district magistrates and the state police to take all necessary measures for prevention of timely and effective response and deterrent actions. Public communication of the state's resolve and actions to deal firmly with miscreants would also help in deterring and instilling confidence in the public and the banking community," it said.

09-07-2020||Bhopal/Lucknow||Gangster Vikas Dubey arrested in Ujjain, was wanted for killing of 8 UP cops in Kanpur||Alleged gangster Vikas Dubey was arrested outside a temple in the pilgrimage city of Ujjain on Thursday after purchasing prasad and an entry ticket to the shrine, ending a six-day manhunt for the man accused of masterminding a deadly ambush on a police party outside his home in Kanpur.Also read: Vikas Dubey flees Faridabad hotel; aide shotFugitive gangster Vikas Dubey a Covid suspectUP gangster Vikas Dubey's close aide and relative killed in encounterKnow Vikas Dubey, the gangster behind killing of 8 policemen in KanpurMadhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra said two of Dubey’s associates were also arrested.“We have arrested Dubey and he is in our custody,” Mishra said. “Dubey arrived at the (Mahakal) temple in his car. A police constable identified him first, after which three others (security personnel) were alerted and he was taken aside for questioning and later arrested,” Mishra said.However, temple sources gave a slightly different account. They said Dubey reached the temple gate in the morning and purchased a Rs 250 ticket from a counter near the police post. When he went to a nearby shop to buy prasad for the deity, the shop owner identified him and alerted police, they added.It is not clear if he was arrested immediately, before he could enter the temple, or later when he came out of the temple after performing darshan, as some media reports said.When the cops asked him his name, he loudly said “Vikas Dubey”, following which they and private security personnel deployed at the temple nabbed him, the sources said.Asked who had identified the gangster first, Mishra said: “We will share details after going deep into the matter.“It is a matter of intelligence and we can’t reveal it now.”            “It is a big achievement for the Madhya Pradesh police. They were on high alert after the Kanpur incident,” Mishra told reporters.Carrying a reward of Rs 5 lakh for information leading to his arrest, Dubey had been on the run since last Friday night when a police party, which had gone to arrest him from his house in Bikru village in the Chaubeypur area of Kanpur, was ambushed. The group was caught in a hail of gunfire from rooftops, which left eight policemen, including a deputy superintendent, dead.Police say he has been a prime accused in some 60 criminal cases in his lifetime, including murders. He was accused of killing a BJP MLA in a police station 20 years ago but was acquitted for lack of evidence.Lauding Ujjain police for arresting Dubey, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tweeted, “Those who feel that after going to the Mahakal temple, their sins will be wiped out, they do not know about the Mahakal. Our government will not spare any criminals.”     Chouhan said he spoke to his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath after the arrest. The MP police will hand over Dubey to Uttar Pradesh police, he added.Two more aides gunned down in separate encounters in Uttar PradeshMeanwhile, two more aides of Dubey were gunned down in separate encounters in Uttar Pradesh, police said.Kartikeya, who was arrested from Faridabad on Wednesday, was being brought to Kanpur on transit remand when he snatched the pistol of a policeman and tried to flee, ADG, Law and Order Prashant Kumar said.“The encounter took place in the Panki area of Kanpur when the police vehicle had a flat tyre. Taking advantage of the situation, Kartikeya tried to flee after snatching the pistol of a policeman,” he said.Kartikeya fired at the policemen accompanying him, injuring two Special Task Force (STF) personnel, and was killed in the ensuing exchange of fire, the officer said.The other aide, Praveen alias Bauwa Dubey, also wanted in connection with the Kanpur ambush, was killed in an encounter in Etawah, the police said.“The police team surrounded a person at about 4.30 am and he was killed in an exchange of fire. The deceased was identified as Praveen alias Bauwa Dubey. He was carrying a reward of Rs 50,000 for information leading to his arrest,” Etawah SP Akash Tomar said.Five persons have been killed in police encounters since the Kanpur ambush.Amar Dubey was killed in Uttar Pradeshs Hamirpur on Wednesday, while Prem Prakash Pandey and Atul Dubey were gunned down in an encounter in Kanpur on July 3.While BJP MLAs and a Samajwadi Party spokesperson denied any connection with the gangster, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra demanded a CBI probe to ascertain the facts about the “grant of protection” to Vikas Dubey and targeted the state government over the episode.“The Uttar Pradesh government has completely failed in acting with alacrity in the ghastly Kanpur massacre.Despite an alert, the gangster reaching Ujjain exposes the chinks in security and points to collusion,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.A police team from Kanpur, which had reached Ujjain, left for Uttar Pradesh by road on Thursday evening after Vikas Dubey was handed over to it, an official said.Right now Vikas Dubey is in Samajwadi Party, says motherSarla Devi, Vikas Dubey’s mother, said her son is with the Samajwadi Party, a claim denied by the party.Asked what should be done by the government after her son’s arrest, she said it should do whatever it feels is appropriate (sarkar jo uchit samjhe, woh kare).In a 2017 viral video on social media, the gangster is heard claiming that two BJP MLAs helped him in the past.“At this time, he is not in the BJP, he is with the Samajwadi Party, Sarla Devi told reporters. A Samajwadi Party spokesperson said Dubey is not a member of the party.A relative of DSP Devendra Mishra, among the eight policemen killed in the Kanpur ambush, questioned the arrest of Vikas Dubey, claiming it was a “well-planned surrender” and the gangster was “saved from death”.“This is not an arrest but he has been saved from death. It was a surrender made in a well-planned manner,” he told reporters.Senior IPS officer Amitabh Thakur tweeted, “We couldn’t arrest Vikas Dubey and he surrendered in Ujjain. We couldn’t arrest him even in such a case and he managed to travel to a distant place. I think this aspect needs to be enquired into.”Congress leaders demand high-level probeAlleging that Vikas Dubey’s “safe exit” from Kanpur and the sequence of events leading to his arrest in Ujjain seemed suspicious, senior Congress leaders demanded a high-level probe into it.One of the Congress leaders said that the gangster’s links with politicians and policemen should also be probed.Taking to Twitter, former MP chief minister Kamal Nath said the gangster’s “safe departure” from Kanpur, arrival at Ujjain and the manner of arrest gave birth to a lot of suspicion.“Such a big criminal whom the police are searching for day and night, his safe exit from Kanpur and arrival in Ujjain and later entry into the temple and the way he shouted to get himself arrested gives birth to a lot of suspicion. It hints at some protection and it should be probed,” Nath tweeted.Congress leader Digvijaya Singh demanded that Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan order a judicial probe into Dubey’s arrest.Terming Vikas Dubey’s arrest as a show, Singh tweeted, “It appears to be a sponsored surrender for saving himself from an encounter with the Uttar Pradesh police. As per my information, it is done with the courtesy of a senior BJP leader of Madhya Pradesh.”The Uttar Pradesh Congress called Dubey’s arrest “scripted and dubious” and demanded a CBI probe into it.“The arrest of Dubey from the premises of Mahakal Temple in Ujjain is scripted and dubious and CBI should probe it, Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Kumar Lallu said.

09-07-2020||Washington||Clinical trials for ayurvedic formulations against Covid to be initiated in India, US||Ayurvedic practitioners and researchers in India and the US are planning to initiate joint clinical trials for ayurveda formulations against the novel coronavirus, the Indian envoy here has said.In a virtual interaction with a group of eminent Indian-American scientists, academics and doctors on Wednesday, Indian Ambassador to US Taranjit Singh Sandhu said the vast network of institutional engagements had brought scientific communities between the two countries together in the fight against Covid-19.“Our institutions have also been collaborating to promote ayurveda through joint research, teaching and training programs. Ayurvedic practitioners and researchers in both the countries are planning to initiate joint clinical trials of ayurvedic formulations against Covid-19,” Sandhu said.“Our scientists have been exchanging knowledge and research resources on this front,” he said.The Indo-US Science Technology Forum (IUSSTF) has always been instrumental in promoting excellence in science, technology and innovation through collaborative activities.To address Covid-19-related challenges, the IUSSTF had given a call to support joint research and start-up engagements. A large number of proposals are being reviewed on fast-track mode by the experts on both the sides, he said.“Indian pharmaceutical companies are global leaders in producing affordable low-cost medicines and vaccines and will play an important role in the fight against this pandemic,” Sandhu said.According to the ambassador, there are at least three ongoing collaborations between Indian vaccine companies with US-based institutions.These collaborations would be beneficial not just to India and the US, but also for the billions who would need to be vaccinated against Covid-19 across the world, he noted.Asserting that innovation would be the key driver in pandemic response and recovery, he said tech-companies and start-ups had already begun to take the lead in this direction."Telemedicine and telehealth will evolve as will other digital platforms across sectors," he said.Noting that there had been longstanding collaboration between India and the US in health sector, he said scientists had been working together in several programs to understand important diseases at basic and clinical level.Many such programs have been focused on translational research to develop new therapeutics and diagnostics.There are over 200 ongoing NIH funded projects in India involving 20 institutions from NIH network and several eminent institutions in India engaged in a wide spectrum of research areas to create health care solutions, the senior diplomat said.The collaboration under Vaccine Action Program (VAP) resulted in development of ROTAVAC vaccine against rota virus which causes severe diarrhoea in children.The vaccine was developed by an Indian company (Bharat Biotech) at an affordable cost. It has been commercialised and introduced in the Expanded Program on Immunisation.Development of many other vaccines such as TB, influenza, chikungunya is also in progress under the VAP, he said.“As I speak, the VAP meeting is in progress where experts from both countries are deeply engaged in technical discussions to expedite development of Covid-19 vaccine,” Sandhu said in his remarks.During the interaction, the eminent experts appreciated India's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and offered their valuable suggestions and best practices in this regard.They shared their ideas on deepening the knowledge partnership between India and the US.The experts who took part in interaction were drawn from wide-ranging fields, including artificial intelligence, quantum information science, biomedical engineering, robotics, mechanical engineering, earth and ocean science, virology, physics, astrophysics, and health sciences.

The deleted concepts and chapters are ones that critically advance the students’ understanding of justice, equality and the foundations of our Constitution, including the development of their scientific temper. In an emergency, any review to rationalise the academic calendar has to depend on a deeper deliberation on the relationship of the curriculum, the syllabus and the textbook, in the context of the process and consistency of students’ learning,” said Rampal.The rationalisation exercise also left other experts surprised with Prof Subhash, adviser to NCERT, saying he was not aware of the move until yesterday. “Normally a review of portions of a chapter can be done but not entire chapters,” he said with many teachers also expressing reservations.Political leaders also came down heavily on it with Congress’ Abhishek Manu Singhvi terming the deletions as “unconstitutional”. He said he would move court in personal capacity. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee too strongly objected to the move.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/syllabus-cut-one-time-move-cbse-110443
09-07-2020||New Delhi||Harvard, MIT lawsuit only hope for students in US||As many as two lakh Indians currently in the US on F-1 student visas risk being forced to return after the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced cancellation of a March 13 exemption for international students.The matter was discussed at Tuesday’s Indo-US Foreign Office talks. India has already been cornered by the US in trade which also seeks to restrict it from buying Russian weaponry. On the other hand, India has suffered the most in the curbs on H-1B visas and the second-most after China on F-1 visas. There was no immediate recorded US response to the concern raised by Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla.While US President Donald Trump said he would lean on the universities to begin normal classes, a petition filed by Harvard and MIT said the ICE order has thrown into chaos virtually all of higher education in the US. An injunctive relief by the Massachusetts District Court is the only hope for the large number of foreign students. Harvard and MIT said several universities had offered most of their fall semester curricula online because the threat of Covid was not over. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/harvard-mit-lawsuit-only-hope-for-students-in-us-110444

09-07-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Generals to meet again to chart out troop reduction||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 8Lt General-level commanders of India and China have been tasked to carry out a complex de-escalation of the military buildup along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.2ND PULLBACK PHASEAt present, there is no change in location or number of long-range guns, tanks & missiles.The commanders of the two sides will begin meeting each other, yet again, anytime next week. They will draw up a timeline for the second stage of the three-step pullback process agreed to by both sides. They will focus on de-escalating the present deployment of war-waging weapons and thousands of troops. Before entering the second stage, the two sides will physically verify the ongoing process of creating a 3-km buffer zone at the LAC between the troops of both sides. The creation of a buffer zone is the first of the three-step process of pulling back. The process started on Monday and the physical verification may start next week.Currently, there is no change in the deployment. Hundreds of artillery guns and tanks, deadly rocket launchers, missiles, fighter jets, airborne bombers and attack helicopters of both sides are lined up near the LAC. Long-range artillery guns, which can take 40-km shots, are deployed 2-3 km away from the LAC, said an official. Both sides have ensured “mirror deployment” (each side matching the other). An estimated 45,000 troops have been deployed by either side along the 826-km LAC in Ladakh. Any miscalculation can lead to a skirmish. From the Indian perspective, China has moved its troops and weapons from 2,000 km away to station them at the LAC, so the PLA cutting back 1.5 km for the buffer zone is of little meaning.Sources said the buffer zone was the smallest of the steps for the de-escalation process. Other than reducing immediate friction along the LAC, it does not cut down military threat posed by weapons.From the Indian side, Leh-based 14 Corps Commander Lt Gen Harinder Singh will be meeting his counterpart of the South Xinjiang military region. There could be multiple meetings before a consensus is reached.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/generals-to-meet-again-to-chart-out-troop-reduction-110302
09-07-2020||New Delhi||Govt aims additional 5L Remdesivir vials by August to ease shortages||India aims to augment the domestic production of antiviral drug Remdesivir’s injectable formulation to at least five lakh vials by August. The authorities have also come down heavily on black marketers of the medicine currently seen as a lifesaver.As COVID cases reached the 7,42,417-mark on Thursday after a daily spike of 22,752 cases, the government sent out clear directives to three domestic manufacturers of Remdesivir to upload their stock situation, supply and distribution chain details for the Centre to monitor the flow of the drug to each patient.Health Ministry, through the Central Drug Standards Control Organisation, on Thursday asked Hetero Drugs, Cipla and Mylan Labs (firms permitted to manufacture Remdesivir generic version in India) to make the supply chain details public. This was done after the government received complaints that one Remdesivir vial, priced at Rs 5,400 by Hetero Drugs, was being sold in the black market between Rs 15,000 to Rs 60,000.The Government had included Remdesivir in the COVID clinical management protocol on June 16 as an investigational therapy for severely ill patients whose oxygen parameters were not improving otherwise.Though the government directed that Remdesivir will not be sold off the shelf and will only be directly supplied to hospitals for patients needing oxygen management, complaints have been pouring in about medical shops telling customers that the drug is in short supply but can be provided if they pay a premium.Doctors have been asking families of severely sick COVID patients to arrange the drug themselves.While Hetero Drugs launched its generic version of the US-based firm Gilead’s Remdesivir in India recently, Cipla launched its product on Thursday with the assurance of producing 10,000 vials every four days.Mylan’s Remdesivir launch is expected between July 22 and 24 with an initial manufacturing capacity of 2.70 lakh vials a month which can be augmented to 4 lakh a month.“The supply situation on Remdesivir front will soon ease,” said a government source. The apex drug Controller has also ordered state counterparts to crack down on hoarders and black marketers of the drug.Meanwhile, the national recovery rate improved to 61.5 per cent on Thursday even as the toll climbed to 20,642 with 482 new fatalities.The number of recoveries as of today are 4,56,830 as against 2,64,944 active cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-aims-additional-5l-remdesivir-vials-by-august-to-ease-shortages-110303

In UP’s Hamirpur district, gangster’s alleged accomplice Amar Dubey, carrying a reward of Rs 50,000, was shot in a firefight. Sources said Amar looked after Dubey’s security.In Faridabad, Dubey was reportedly seen at a hotel, but escaped before the cops reached there. Dubey tried to check in using a fake ID. CCTV footage showed him inside the hotel and later on the roadside. He earlier reportedly took refuge at the house of a relative, Shravan, in the city. Shravan, son Ankur have been arrested along with Dubey’s aide Kartikey.

There have been instances where a manufacturer got the licence in a day and the product was out in the market the next day.The state Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently tested two Ayurvedic sanitisers and both failed the quality test. One of these, manufactured in Jalandhar, contained over 95 per cent methanol. Several others didn’t mention the plant’s location, mandatory under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.The FDA is learnt to have conveyed to the Directorate of Ayurveda about the excess use of methanol in sanitisers.Dr Rakesh Sharma, Director, Ayurveda, said they had received instructions from the Centre to promote ayurvedic products in the fight against Covid-19. “We are testing all Ayurvedic hand sanitisers and will take stringent action against defaulters,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/70-ayurveda-licences-in-3-months-no-checks-110345
09-07-2020||KV Prasad||India should recalibrate China policy||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 8Advocating it is time for India to recalibrate its policy towards China, strategic and policy experts today suggested New Delhi initiates more measures to decouple economically, while seeking to work out with other countries in collectively responding on the economic front.Interpreting the current development as being qualitatively different, former India’s Ambassador to China Gautam Bambawale said on the tactical front China is sending a signal it would unilaterally show what Beijing considers the Line of Actual Control and on the strategic front, India should understand where it stands in the in Asia and the world.‘Strong message must be sent’We have to take more policy measures to show our displeasure with China. Economic decoupling steps will cause pain, but a strong message needs to be sent. —Gautam Bambawale, Former Ambassador to China“We have to take many more policy measures to show our displeasure with China. The policy of engagement has run out of steam in May. India has to undertake a fundamental assessment and recalibrate its China policy,” Bambawale said taking part in a webinar “India-China relations – at an inflection point?” organised by the Institute of Chinese Studies.Stating the economic measures would have to go beyond banning 59 Chinese apps like not allowing Chinese telecom companies to take part in the 5G trials, he said the economic decoupling steps would cause pain, but a strong message it could not be business as usual needs to be sent.On his part, JNU Professor of International Politics Rajesh Rajagopalan felt since except the US, difference in power between China and other countries in the Indo-Pacific region is big, countries facing the brunt of Chinese policies might have to work out a mechanism at least on the economic front to balance it out. One or a set of countries might not be able to face the backlash from China, which could be resisted through combined efforts.In his assessment, at present India does not possess internal capacity to match the difference in power with China. Instead of accepting Beijing’s hegemony, India can balance it out through other countries. More than military response, he said countries could work to balance on the political front by coordinating action in multilateral organisations or what Beijing is doing through the Belt and Road Initiative.Senior analyst and China watcher Tom Miller said the choice before India was to either pursue “strategic autonomy” or join a league of nations emerging against China. In his opinion, given the extent of Indian dependence on China for intermediate products and the extent of investments economic decoupling would not be feasible.In his view, India would have to work putting its national interest over its economic interest considering that despite efforts for over a decade the balance of bilateral trade continues to grow in favour of China.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-should-recalibrate-china-policy-110350
09-07-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Farce, says MEA on Pakistan Jadhav claim||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 8India today accused Pakistan of coercing former Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav into not filing an appeal in the Islamabad High Court against his death sentence by a military court.Pakistan’s claim that Jadhav had refused to initiate a review petition was a “continuation of the farce” that had been in play for the past four years. Jadhav was also sentenced to execution through a farcical trial, asserted the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.“He has clearly been coerced to refuse to file a review in his case,” he added.Pak claim that Jadhav has refused to initiate review petition is a continuation of the farce that has been in play for the last four years. —Anurag Srivastava, MEA SpokespersonAt a press conference staged at the Pakistan Foreign Office earlier in the day, Pakistan’s Additional Attorney General Ahmed Irfan said the authorities had asked Jadhav to file a review petition but he instead opted to apply for a mercy petition.In an attempt to divert public attention to the case, he said Jadhav could meet his father and wife, in case India was willing. After denying 22 requests, Pakistan had allowed a 40-minute meeting with his wife and mother in 2018, two years after he was detained. Jadhav’s second meeting was with Indian chargé d’affaires in Islamabad Gaurav Ahluwalia in late 2019.However, there are still 11 days to go for Jadhav or his legal representative to file a review petition in the Islamabad HC after Pakistan issued an ordinance on May 20, giving him six months to comply with an International Court of Justice (ICJ) order in the case. The six months end on July 19. Shrivastava said the media statement made by Pakistan “masks its continuing reticence” to implement ICJ judgment in letter and spirit. India had sought unimpeded access to discuss his remedies under the ordinance.“They all along maintained that their laws allowed for effective review and reconsideration while we have protested it all along. Now, after almost a year, they have made a U-turn and issued an ordinance to ostensibly provide for some sort of review,” he pointed out. India has already expressed its serious concern at the content of the ordinance and how it violates the ICJ judgment.India has also asked to allow a lawyer from outside Pakistan to appear for Jadhav in any review proceeding. However, Pakistan says only a lawyer holding the license of a particular court can represent clients. The MEA said Pakistan has also refused to hand over any relevant document, including FIR, evidence and court order to India.Convicted of ‘spying’ in 2017||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farce-says-mea-on-pakistan-jadhav-claim-110185
