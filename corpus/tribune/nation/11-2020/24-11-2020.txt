Do they know that India’s tallest leaders, be it Indira Gandhi and Atal Behari Vajpayee or Somnath Chatterjee and LK Advani were members of the Rajya Sabha at some point,” Sharma, one of the 23 leaders who wrote a letter asking for a complete overhaul of Congress structures down to block committees, said. Sharma’s comments came a day after the Congress officially advised “nominated Rajya Sabha leaders” to follow party discipline and not talk out of line about internal affairs.Sharma’s target was party spokesperson Pawan Khera, who, responding to recent remarks on Congress debacles by Rajya Sabha members Kapil Sibal and Ghulam Nabi Azad said: “The nominated senior leaders have access to the party leadership and should refrain from speaking publicly”.A visibly perturbed Anand Sharma, also a Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament, said on Tuesday that those undermining the Rajya Sabha were far removed from its origins and the fact that the Rajya Sabha is the only permanent house of the Indian Parliament.“Rajya Sabha was the first to be constituted and then came the Lok Sabha. The Constitution clearly states that RS members, barring the 12 nominated ones, are elected by the MLAs of the state assemblies,” Sharma said. “Whether RS or Lok Sabha, all MPs are elected. Lok Sabha members get elected only because they have bagged party nominations. Likewise nominated fight Rajya Sabha elections.”The former UPA minister today said party leaders should stop undermining RS members and remember the importance of RS which is the Council of States akin to the US Senate.“People questioning the Rajya Sabha members are disrespecting the Constitution. Late Indira Gandhi was a member of which House when she became prime minister," Sharma said,"Atal Behari Vajpayee was a member of which house when he wrote a letter to Pt Nehru on the 1962 War? Former PM Manmohan Singh was a member of which House? So people must maintain decency in discourse,” he said, advising detractors in the Congress to “mind their language”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stop-undermining-rajya-sabha-leaders-anand-sharma-to-cong-detractors-175248
24-11-2020||New Delhi||Violence against girls and women in UP rose from 23.5% in 2015-16 to 51% in 2018-19: Study||Violence against girls and women in the country’s most populous state Uttar Pradesh rose from 23.5 per cent in 2015-16 to 51 per cent in 2018-19 while the sexual violence increased from 30 per cent to 48 per cent in the same period, according to a new study based on a survey of 10,100 adolescents.The results of the findings were released on the eve of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.When asked why UP was chosen for the study, the Population Council said it is because it is the most populous state in the country.The UDAYA (Understanding the lives of adolescents and young adults) study by NGO Population Council was carried out on 10,100 adolescents in Uttar Pradesh in 2015-16. The same set of adolescents was re-interviewed in 2018-19.According to the study, the number of married girls who reported ever experiencing emotional, physical or sexual violence almost doubled over the two survey waves.“In 2015-16, physical violence with married girls (15-19 years) was recorded at 23.5 per cent which more than doubled and shot up to 51 per cent in 2018-19. In 2015-16 sexual violence was recorded at 30 per cent, which increased up to 48 per cent. Emotional violence in 2015-16 was recorded at 19 per cent, which increased to 35 per cent,” the study said.The study also captures mobile-phone/internet based harassment. It clearly shows an increasing trend in the survey years from 2015-16 to 2018-19. Married girl respondents in UP aged between 15-19 in 2015-16 experienced 3 per cent internet based harassment, which increased to 4.8 per cent in 2018-19.However, the study also observed that gender discriminatory practices among adolescent girls have reduced over time. Girls aged between 15-19 years in 2015-16 was 23 per cent improved to 18 per cent in 2018-19.                   Besides Uttar Pradesh, the study has been conducted also in Bihar. UP and Bihar comprise 25 per cent of the country’s adolescents population.Both states together constitute almost one-fourth of adolescent population. Also, the vulnerabilities such as early age at marriage, sexual and reproductive health risks are high in both the states              The Population Council said it is planning to extend its study to other states too.

24-11-2020||New Delhi||Modi likely to lay foundation stone for new Parliament building in December||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to lay the foundation stone for a new Parliament building in the first half of December, sources said on Tuesday.The sources further said that around five statues, including of Mahatma Gandhi and Bhim Rao Ambedkar, in the Parliament complex are also likely to be relocated temporarily due to the construction work and they will be reinstalled at prominent places within the new complex once the project is completed.The new building will be constructed close to the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project and it is expected to be completed in 21 months from the start of construction work.The redevelopment project of Central Vista—the nation’s power corridor—envisages a new triangular parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.Although the proposed date of laying the foundation stone of the new Parliament building is around December 10, the final date would depend on the availability of the prime minister, the sources said.According to the plan, the new parliament building, which will have separate offices for all MPs, will be equipped with the latest digital interfaces as a step towards creating “paperless offices”.The new building will also have a grand Constitution Hall to showcase India’s democratic heritage, a lounge for members of Parliament, a library, multiple committee rooms, dining areas and ample parking space.The sources said that five statues, including of Mahatma Gandhi and Bhim Rao Ambedkar, at the existing Parliament complex are likely to be relocated temporarily and they would be reinstalled once the construction work of the new Parliament building is completed.The iconic 16-feet high statue of Mahatama Gandhi is located opposite Gate Number 1 of Parliament House.The statue greets visitors to Parliament House and has also been the location of gatherings, protests and press interactions by MPs.According to Rajya Sabha’s website, the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in a meditating posture sculpted by Ram Sutar, was unveiled by the then President of India Dr Shanker Dayal Sharma on October 2, 1993. It also said that the statue was donated by the Ministry of Urban Development.In September, Tata Projects Limited had won the bid to construct a new parliament building at a cost of Rs 861.90 crore.The existing building is a British-era building, designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker who were responsible for planning and construction of New Delhi.The foundation stone of the existing Parliament House was laid on February 12, 1921 and the construction took six years and cost Rs 83 lakh at that time. The opening ceremony was performed on January 18, 1927 by the then Governor-General of India, Lord Irwin.According to CPWD, the existing parliament building will continue to function during the entire period of execution of the project. Once the new building is built, the existing parliament building will be used for other purposes.The CPWD had said, “The plinth of the new building shall match that of the existing one, which is approximately 1.8 metres above the ground level.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-likely-to-lay-foundation-stone-for-new-parliament-building-in-december-175246

Our intention was never to 'trivialize' or offend," a spokeswoman for the firm said.Lord Ganesh, readily identified by his elephant head, is one of the best-known and most worshipped deities in the world's third largest religion which has about 1.2 billion followers. He is the patron of intellectuals, bankers, scribes and authors.India's ambassador in Brazil, Suresh Reddy, spoke to the company's owner Jon Cotre to explain the sensitivities related to using images of Lord Ganesh, the embassy said.Cotre immediately agreed to remove the images and material from his stores, the embassy said in a statement.A Hindu cleric based in the United States, Rajan Zed, had criticized the inappropriate commercial use of Lord Ganesh images, complaining about "religious appropriation, sacrilege and the ridiculing entire communities."

24-11-2020||New Delhi||'Khichdification' of medical education, practice: IMA on surgery nod for Ayurveda||The IMA on Tuesday demanded withdrawal of a Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) notification  authorising post-graduate Ayurveda practitioners to be trained to perform general surgical procedures, saying the move was a "khichadification", or a confused mix, of medical education and practice.     The November 20 notification by the CCIM, a statutory body under the AYUSH Ministry to regulate the Indian systems of medicine, listed 39 general surgery procedures and around 19 procedures involving the eye, ear, nose and throat by amending the Indian Medicine Central Council (Post Graduate Ayurveda Education) Regulations, 2016.The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on November 22 had condemned the move, describing it as a "retrograde step of mixing the systems".       In a statement issued on Tuesday, the IMA said the long list of modern medicine surgeries that had been enlisted under Shalya Tantra and Shalakya Tantra squarely fall under the ambit, authority and jurisdiction of the modern medicine practice.While the AYUSH Ministry issued a clarification claiming that the technical terms and modern developments are a common heritage of mankind, the IMA rejected their clarification as being "deceptive camouflage of mixing the systems of medicine"."The entire modern medical profession of the nation feels betrayed by the level of violation and encroachment by the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM)."It is nothing but a blatant attempt at mixopathy and khichadification of medical education and practice. The CCIM amendments cannot be seen in isolation. The National Education Policy 2020 speaks of medical pluralism and lateral entry laying the foundation legitimising mixopathy."India remains at the frontier of modern medicine today with medical care of international standards and well-reputed Indian doctors serving the globe. What is the point in losing such a legacy and leadership," asked IMA national president Rajan Sharma.      Seeking an emergency session, the Central Working Committee of the IMA has directed all the 28 state branches to hold their State Working Committees. The quantum and timing of the first all-India response to the situation is being determined which, the IMA said, would not be later than December 2."This is not the issue of the profession alone, but also entails serious inroads into the healthcare delivery system of the country. This involves calibration of patient care for years to come and people of India have a right to understand these manoeuvres. The patient's choice to choose the system of medicine is being taken away in the naked attempt to mix all systems of medicine," said IMA secretary general RV Asokan. "The empty words of the AYUSH Ministry of deep commitment to maintain the authenticity of Indian systems of medicine and that it is against any mixing of systems sound hollow in their pregnant silence to the medical pluralism advocated by the National Education Policy, 2020 and the infamous attempts of NITI Aayog to mix all systems of medicine into a single integrative system. They remain culpable and cannot be absolved of the crime," he said.The IMA further stated that there were a plethora of issues arising out of such indiligent decisions which would directly impact patient care and safety and it also questioned about the use of terminologies by Ayurveda practitioners.Questioning if AYUSH have their own anaesthesia drugs and procedures, the IMA asked whether the pre-anaesthetic medication would be named as AYUSH drug, and the AYUSH doctors would be termed as AYUSH anesthetists."It is very obvious that AYUSH is dependent on modern medicine doctors, anaesthesia, antibiotics and equipment to perform modern medicine surgical procedures. It fails the test of logic behind such irresponsible initiative placing thousands of gullible patients at risk," the doctors' body said in the statement.It questioned what about postoperative care and infection control and how would a system not subscribing to microbial theory find a way to control sepsis.It asked how the government would find adequate resources to create new infrastructure from nowhere to fend for this modern medicine B team.        "The object and purpose of mixing the systems is perhaps borne out of a false claim on heritage. The medical colleges in Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai were established in 19th century and remain heritage of man."Some of the sensational discoveries like the malarial parasite and its treatment were formulated in India. Modern medicine is as much Indian... Rapid strides in modern medicine like vaccination and chemotherapy of tuberculosis took their baby steps in India," Sharma added.It said the IMA was prepared for the ensuing long-drawn struggle for existence and identity.All associations of the fraternity, including the specialities and students, are determined to resist this ill-advised adventure in national life, the IMA said, adding the health of generations of Indians is at stake.      According to the November 20 gazette notification the procedures listed include removal of metallic and non-metallic foreign bodies from non-vital organs, excision of simple cyst or benign tumours (lipoma, fibroma, schwanoma, etc.) of non-vital organs, amputation of gangrene, traumatic wound management, foreign body removal from stomach, squint surgery, cataract surgery and functional endoscopic sinus surgery.

24-11-2020||New Delhi||NSCN-IM claims MHA ordered ops against it, says its ‘patience’ should not be treated as ‘weakness’||The NSCN-IM on Tuesday accused the Centre of being “insincere” in finding a permanent solution to the seven-decade-old Naga insurgency problem and said the outfit’s patience should not be considered its weakness as its “consequences could be disastrous” for both sides.The Naga insurgent group also claimed the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has issued a directive to the Assam Rifles (AR) to intensify operations against its cadres in a “rude shock” to the group.In a statement, the NSCN-IM said the Naga people’s “sincere approach” and search for permanent peace have been touted time and again to suit “India’s colonial divide and rule policy” and it reflected in the ongoing peace talks between the group and the Central government.The NSCN-IM said the signing of the Framework Agreement on August 3, 2015, to find a permanent solution, is a living document to take the Central government and the group through to the final solution.It said the Nagas have come this far in search of a peaceful solution and what really matters now is the political will to be exercised by the central government to push for the final deal, it said.“But the government of India still continues to waver. This is a sign of weakness and insincerity,” it alleged.There have been reports that the dialogue between the NSCN-IM and the Centre’s representatives is making no headway as the outfit has been stuck with its demand for a separate flag and a Constitution for Nagaland, which was rejected by the Centre.Referring to the purported MHA directive to the Assam Rifles, the NSCN-IM said the Naga political issue cannot be undermined in such a manner that contradicts the “well established historical and political rights” of the Naga people spread across Nagaland, Manipur, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Myanmar.“The political right of the Naga people is no longer an issue that necessitated any review,” it said.The Naga group said the framework agreement is a symbol of its olive branch to the government and the desire to live peacefully.“However, this has not been reciprocated with the correct political steps,” it claimed.The NSCN-IM asked the Central government to handle the situation with “great sensitivity and not prodded the Indian security forces and other security agencies to run amok against” it.“In such a situation, NSCN members cannot allow themselves to be sitting ducks. Our patience should not be translated as weak and helpless. The consequences, therefore, will be disastrous for both the parties. This is never in the interest of the ceasefire across Naga areas,” it said.The framework agreement, which was signed in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, came after over 80 rounds of negotiations spanning 18 years, with the first breakthrough made in 1997 when the ceasefire agreement was sealed after decades of insurgency in Nagaland which started soon after India’s independence in1947.

We are not taking any coercive steps,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde.Taking note of Mehta’s submission, the Bench adjourned the matter for four weeks.The court is seized of several applications, including the one by Delhi Congress leader Ajay Maken, seeking rehabilitation of the affected slum dwellers before they were dislodged.The top court had on August 31 ordered the removal of around 48,000 jhuggis along the railway tracks in Delhi in a phased manner in three months and said there shall not be any kind of political interference in implementation of its order.Restraining courts from granting any kind of stay with respect to removal of these encroachments along railway tracks, the top court had said 70 per cent of the requisite amount shall be borne by the Railways and 30 per cent by the State Government and the manpower be provided by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), Railways and agencies available with the Government, free of cost, and they will not charge it from each other.Earlier, Mehta had told the Bench on September 14 that no slum dwellers along the 140 km length of railway tracks in Delhi would be removed until a final decision was taken by the government in consultation with the Railways.On behalf of Maken, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi had urged the Bench to order status quo but the court didn’t oblige him.The petitioners had submitted that it would be highly risky to demolish the hutments of more than 2,50,000 people during COVID19 pandemic without prior rehabilitation as they will be forced to move from place to place in search of shelter and livelihood.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-coercive-action-to-remove-48-000-slum-dwellings-along-rail-tracks-in-delhi-175229

The margin of profit is so high as it is as high as 1,400 per cent in Andhra Pradesh and 1,200 per cent in Delhi,” Agrawal said in his petition. The RT-PCR kits were presently available for less than Rs 200 in the Indian market, he submitted.“There is no other cost as the machines used for the RT-PCR test are already there with the laboratories as they conduct a large number of tests. And the matter is concerned with 135 crore citizens of the country as everybody worried about the coronavirus and forced to get their test done at this exorbitant price,” the petition stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-centre-on-pil-seeking-to-fix-maximum-rate-for-covid-19-test-175226

The positivity rate is 5.8 per cent in the state, which is much better than the national average of 6.89 per cent, he said, adding that his government is working to bring it below 5 per cent.

24-11-2020||New Delhi||File assets details by Nov 30 or face disciplinary action: CVC to govt officials||The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has asked all central government officials to file details of their movable and immovable assets by this month-end, failing which will attract disciplinary action, according to an official order.The probity watchdog expressed deep concerns over prolonged delay in filing of such details by the government officials and set the November 30 deadline for 100 per cent compliance.“Non-filing of property returns constitutes good and sufficient reasons for instituting disciplinary action against the delinquent officials,” the CVC said in the order issued on Monday.It said the timely filing of property return by the officials of ministries, departments or organisations is one of the mandatory requirements under conduct rules.While examining the reports submitted by some of the chief vigilance officers (CVOs), the commission has observed that in most of the organisations, many of the officials are yet to file their annual immovable or movable property return for the previous year i.e., 2019, the order said.In most organisations, the last date for filing of return is January 31.Almost nine months have since lapsed and the organisations are yet to secure 100 per cent compliance in this regard, it said.“Those officers/officials who do not file their immovable or movable property (IPR/MPR) by 30.11.2020, appropriate disciplinary action may be initiated against them,” the CVC said.Property returns are also a good tool for CVOs to detect the source of funding of the assets of the officials and to find out whether these have been acquired through legal means, said the order issued to secretaries of all central government departments, chairman and managing directors of public sector banks and insurance companies among others.“The Commission has expressed its deep concern at such a prolonged delay in filing of IPR/MPR by the officers/officials of organisations and has directed to complete the exercise latest by 30th November, 2020 to achieve 100 per cent compliance,” it said.All CVOs or administrative authorities should ensure “strict compliance” to these instructions under intimation to the Commission, the order added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/file-assets-details-by-nov-30-or-face-disciplinary-action-cvc-to-govt-officials-175220

24-11-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||India’s strategic ties with US to progress with pressure on human rights||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 24Among the wave of staff picks by Joe Biden are nominees to two crucial posts—Secretary of State Tony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan – who are old sub-continental hands and, like the US President-elect, have pushed for closer ties with India, especially in the Indo-Pacific and against China.However, the evidence of their stints in the Obama Administration and their recent observations on India show that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is unlikely to get a free pass on CAA and NRC.He may also be nudged from his hard-line position of not talking to Pakistan and asserting that all that remains to be discussed on Kashmir is the handing over the occupied part to India. We have challenges and concerns about…. cracking down on freedom of movement and speech in Kashmir and some of the laws on citizenship.Tony Blinken, Biden’s nominee for Secretary of State.Already, Democratic Party supporters have urged Blinken to include India in the State Department’s list of “countries of particular concern”.“A strong US-India strategic partnership should be anchored in an understanding that the geopolitical interests of both countries are best served by advancing democracy, human rights and religious freedom,” reasoned the Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) in a statement.It appealed to Blinken, the “stepson of a Holocaust survivor”, to ensure that the US introduces specific reference to pluralism and freedom in all future pacts with India in trade and defence cooperation. It also wanted Blinken, whom it briefed in April this year on the CAA and NRC, to pursue modifications in both laws to end the “inherent anti-Muslim bias”.Both Sullivan and Blinken are clear that the US’ strategic future in the subcontinent lies with India. At the same time they are mindful of the need to preserve geopolitical stability in South Asia.It may be a coincidence but Blinken was in India in 2015 and, shortly thereafter, then Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj travelled to Islamabad followed by PM Modi’s surprise touchdown in Pakistan to meet its then PM Nawaz Sharif.Blinken, as a matter of policy approach, is in favour of “engaging with a partner about areas where you have difference even as you are working to build a greater cooperation and strengthen the relationship going forward”.But India can breathe easy on the Iran front as Sullivan has been clear about negotiating on the Iran nuclear deal. It can also look forward to a structured discussion on trade issues which were hostage to Trump’s bullying approach for the past four years.Both Blinken and Sullivan are clear that India will be a useful partner to deal with China’s across-the-board assertiveness with the former criticising PLA’s aggressiveness on the LAC and its deployment of economic might to “coerce others and reap unfair advantage.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-strategic-ties-with-us-to-progress-with-pressure-on-human-rights-175212

The federations of Railways and Defence employees have decided for large mobilisation on the day to express their solidarity with this strike action and the demands of the unions, the statement added.The united front of the Kisan organisations in India named as AIKSCC has extended its support to the general strike of workers and would be mobilising in rural India to express solidarity with the workers.The trade unions have also extended their support to the 'Parliament Chalo' march of 26-27 November by AIKSCC, the umbrella organisation of Indian farmers,  along with the mobilisation of workers all over India to stand with farmers against the agriculture laws.The demands of the strike include cash transfer of Rs 7,500 per month for all non-income tax paying families and 10 kg free ration per person per month to all needy.The unions also demanded for expansion of MGNREGA (rural employment guarantee scheme) to provide 200 days' work in a year in rural areas at enhanced wages and also extension of the employment guarantee to urban areas.They have asked the government to withdraw all "anti-farmer laws and anti-worker labour codes and stop privatisation of public sector including the financial sector and stop corporatisation of government-run manufacturing and service entities like railways, ordinance factories, ports etc."        They also stressed in their demand to withdraw the "draconian circular on forced premature retirement of government and PSU employees".The unions have also put forth other demands that include 'pension to all', scrapping NPS (National Pension System) and restoration of earlier pension with improvement in EPS-95 (Employees' Pension Scheme-1995 run by retirement fund body EPFO).

24-11-2020||Lucknow||UP okays ordinance against conversion for marriage||The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday approved a draft ordinance to deal with religious conversion for the sake of marriage, which could land violators in jail for up to 10 years.An official spokesperson said the state Cabinet gave its nod to the ordinance at its meeting chaired here by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.In recent weeks, BJP-run states like Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh have revealed plans to enact laws to counter alleged attempts to convert Hindu women to Islam in the guise of marriage, which Hindu activists refer to as “love jihad”.“The way in which religious conversions are done using deceit, lies, force and dishonesty is heart wrenching, and it was necessary to have a law in this regard,” Cabinet minister and UP government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said.He said punishment under the new law is a jail term from one and five years, and a fine of Rs 15,000.But if the woman involved is a minor or belongs to a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe, the jail term would range from three to 10 years, he said. The fine would increase to Rs 25,000.“In the case of mass conversions, the punishment is from three years to 10 years and a fine of Rs 50,000 on the organisations which indulge in it,” the minister told reporters.Singh said if anyone wants to change religion after marriage, then he or she can do so.But the district magistrate has to be informed two months in advance in a prescribed form, and the person can convert once permission is granted.He claimed that this will resolve law and order problems. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-okays-ordinance-against-conversion-for-marriage-175206
24-11-2020||Jammu||J&K land encroachments under Roshni Act biggest land scam of India: Anurag Thakur||Union minister Anurag Thakur on Tuesday called the Roshni land scheme the “biggest land scam of India”, and questioned NC leader Farooq Abdullah and others as to what necessitated them to ‘grab’ government lands even after ruling Jammu and Kashmir for three generations.He also termed the Gupkar alliance as a symbol of “self-interest, scam and separatism”.Former J&K chief ministers Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah have been named by the Jammu and Kashmir administration in a list which alleges that their residential house in Jammu is built over illegally-possessed land, a charge denied by the father-son duo.The administration of the Union territory as directed by the Jammu and Kashmir High Court to make public land given under the controversial Roshni land scheme, since scrapped by a court, came out with the list of beneficiaries.On Tuesday, it came out with a list of those who had allegedly encroached land other than those given under the scheme.“The Roshni scheme is the biggest land scam of India,” Thakur said.“They (Farooq Abdullah and others) should explain to the people of India as to why they grabbed state lands and made laws to legalise occupancy while they served the state for three generations,” he told reporters here.“The National Conference (NC) leaders have encroached upon government lands. The party’s Srinagar and Jammu offices came to them under the same scheme,” Thakur said.The Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs also alleged that 3.42 lakh kanal of government land, including forest and state land, has been encroached during the last three decades.“The Roshni scheme was brought in 2001 to raise Rs 25,000 crore to light up Jammu and Kashmir by investing the amount in power projects. But only Rs 76 crore was realised in the revenue records,” he said.Lambasting the Gupkar alliance, Thakur said it benefited the corrupt political class by lighting up their houses instead of those of poor and landless people of the state.Mainstream political parties in Jammu and Kashmir had formed the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration for restoration of the special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir as it existed before August 5 last year and also to initiate a dialogue between all stakeholders in the issue.

24-11-2020||K V Prasad ||India-Africa relations scope for greater engagement||Tribune News Service New Delhi, November 24 Outlining India’s outreach to Africa and the tremendous scope to increase relations with the continent was the highlight of a discussion on how to take the ties forward, with Africa suggesting India could expand cooperation and investment in agriculture, banking, and tourism and telecom sectors. Stressing that India should be able to realise as a strong and reliable partner of Africa, Dean of African Diplomatic Corps, Ambassador Alem Tsehye Woldermariam said the continent benefited with New Delhi providing succour to the people supplying pharmaceuticals in the times of the global pandemic. Identifying development of blue economy and rich maritime resources, Ambassador Woldemariam of Eritrea said India should consider investing and relocating its production lines to the continent and enjoy duty and quota free access. Taking part in the inaugural session of a two-day webinar “India-Africa Looking Ahead: Contemporary Realities and Emerging Projects” organised by the Indian Council of World Affairs, Ambassador Woldermariam said India became a pharmacy for the world during Covid19 pandemic and assisted many countries in Africa with some receiving grants. He welcomed the public-private partnership initiative through which prestigious hospitals in India are training medical professionals from Africa. On his part Rahul Chhabra, Secretary (Economic Relations) in the Ministry of External Affairs said India’s development partnership with Africa has seen completion of 194 projects in 37 countries and 77 projects in the works across 29 countries with a value of U.S. $ 11.6 billion. India currently has 38 missions with a fourth of them opening during the last two years. India hopes to open up to 47 missions in Africa by 2022. Citing the e-Vidya Bharti and e-Aarogya Bharti through which countries in the continent benefit on education and health at a low cost, he said there is scope for expansion since currently around 20 countries are utilising the programmes. As for trade and investment, he said, Indian businesses could take advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Areas Agreement and also focus on energy including renewable energy. India also lay special emphasis on improving people-to-people partnership setting up 6 IT institutes, 7 vocational training institutes, working on entrepreneurial centres and technology centres.Identifying emerging areas for development, he said, these include technology and fintech, IT, Defence and Security, Maritime Security since India and Africa share Indian ocean as commons. The overall policy towards Africa, he said, is based on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 10 guiding principles outlined in the July 2018 speech in Uganda.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-africa-relations-scope-for-greater-engagement-175200
24-11-2020||London||Para-athlete, climate activist among Indian women on BBC’s top 100 for 2020||Indian para-athlete and current para-badminton world champion Manasi Joshi and climate activist Ridhima Pandey are among four Indian women to be included in the ‘BBC 100 Women 2020’ list released on Tuesday.The list, which celebrates inspirational and influential women across the globe – from high profile names to unsung heroes, also includes 82-year-old Bilkis Bano for leading a peaceful protest against the new citizenship law and Isaivani for breaking male domination in the field of Tamil Nadu’s Gaana singing.“In a year of unprecedented turbulence, this year’s theme is ‘How Women Led Change in 2020’ and celebrates some of the scientists, public health experts, and healthcare workers who have helped us weather the storm of the global pandemic, as well as women from other industries who have all been leaders of change in their own way – from politicians, lawyers and architects to actors, writers, athletes, singers and those who have sought to improve the lives of others in their community,” the BBC said in a statement.The worldwide list includes Sanna Marin, who leads Finland’s all-female coalition government; Michelle Yeoh, star of the new Avatar and Marvel films; and Sarah Gilbert, who heads the Oxford University research into a coronavirus vaccine; as well as Jane Fonda, a climate activist and actress.“For the first time, this year’s list will see the 100th spot left blank to honour all the women who made an impact and a sacrifice in this extraordinary year and allow our audiences to fill it with someone meaningful to them,” the BBC said.In reference to the Indian women to make the cut, the list notes that in June 2020, the Badminton World Federation ranked Manasi Joshi as world number two in the SL3 singles.“She is also an engineer and a change-maker and aspires to drive a shift in how disability and para-sports are perceived in India,” it reads.At the age of nine, Ridhima Pandey filed a petition against the Government of India in response to its alleged inaction to mitigate climate change. In 2019, along with 15 other child petitioners, Ridhima filed a lawsuit against five countries at the United Nations.While Bilkis Bano became the face of a long-running protest in New Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, Isaivani has spent years singing and performing in a male-dominated space.“To perform on the same stage as other popular male singers can be considered an achievement by itself. Isaivani has successfully broken an age-old tradition, which has led other young female gaana singers to come forward and express themselves,” her citation notes.Gaana is a form of traditional Tamil music which emerged from the working class neighbourhoods of north Chennai.The release of the list this week kicks off the BBC’s spotlight on women’s experiences around the world with a week of special interviews, inspirational masterclasses, documentaries, features and digital content across the BBC’s UK and international TV, radio and online services.

24-11-2020||New Delhi||India successfully test-fires land-attack version of BrahMos supersonic cruise missile||India on Tuesday "successfully" test fired the surface-to-surface supersonic cruise missile BrahMos as part of a series of planned trials of the weapon, known for its precision strike capabilities, official sources said.The range of the new land-attack version of the missile has been extended to 400 km from the original 290 km but its speed has been maintained at 2.8 Mach or almost three times the speed of sound, they said."The land-attack version of the missile was test-fired in the Andaman and Nicobar at around 10 am and it was a successful trial," said an official source.According to sources, in the next few days, the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy are scheduled to carry out separate test-firing of the new version of the air-launched and naval versions of the supersonic cruise missile respectively.BrahMos Aerospace, an India-Russian joint venture, produces the lethal weapon that can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft, or from land platforms.India has already deployed a sizeable number of the original BrahMos missiles and other key assets in several strategic locations along the Line of Actual Control with China in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh.In the last two-and-half months, India has test fired a number of missiles including an anti-radiation missile named Rudram-1 which is planned to be inducted into service by 2022.On October 18, a naval version of the BrahMos missile was successfully test fired from an indigenously-built stealth destroyer of the Indian Navy in the Arabian sea.The Indian Air Force on October 30 test-fired the air launched version of the weapon from a Sukhoi fighter aircraft in the Bay of Bengal.The BrahMos missile provides the IAF a much-desired capability to strike from large stand-off ranges on any target at sea or on land with pinpoint accuracy by day or night and in all weather conditions.The IAF is also integrating the Brahmos supersonic cruise missile on over 40 Sukhoi fighter jets which is aimed at bolstering overall combat capability of the force.

This has caused losses to farmers as well as consumers,” the Trinamool Congress supremo said.Alleging that the central government has looted everything from farmers through the acts, the chief minister said that prices of potatoes are increasing alarmingly.She said that the state government should not be blamed for the high prices of items like potato or onion, which were earlier in the list of essential commodities.The Centre in September enacted the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, which removed cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oil, onions and potatoes from the list.“The Centre has made such an act that it (pricing) has gone into the hands of blackmarketeers,” Banerjee said.She said that the West Bengal government is still selling potatoes at Rs 25 per kg from its ‘Sufal Bangla’ outlets with the stock it had procured earlier.

Since November 8, the number of daily cases has been sustained below the 50,000-mark, the ministry said.On an average, more than 10 lakh daily tests have ensured that the cumulative positivity rate is sustained at low levels, the ministry underlined, adding that it is presently following a downward trajectory.The tests per million (TPM) figure has increased to 96,871, it highlighted.India’s testing infrastructure has seen a significant boost with 2,134 laboratories across the country currently.In line with its commitment to conduct more than 10 lakh tests per day, 10,99,545 samples were tested in a span of 24 hours, the ministry said.“The cumulative national COVID-19 positivity rate stands at 6.87 per cent as on date, less than the 7 per cent-mark, while the daily positivity rate is just 3.45 per cent. Higher volumes of testing eventually lead to a low positivity rate,” it said.There has been a sustained decrease in the number of active cases over the past few weeks, the ministry said, adding that 42,314 COVID-19 patients recovered from the disease and were discharged in a span of 24 hours.The active COVID-19 caseload of the country has fallen to 4,38,667 or merely 4.78 per cent of the total cases reported so far, while the number of recoveries has crossed 86 lakh, the ministry said, adding that 75.71 per cent of the new recoveries were concentrated in 10 states and Union territories.Delhi has reported the highest number of 7,216 single-day recoveries, followed by Kerala (5,425) and Maharashtra (3,729), it said.Further, 77.04 per cent of the fresh COVID-19 cases were reported from 10 states and Union territories.Delhi continued to report the highest number of daily cases at 4,454, followed by Maharashtra (4,153), the ministry said.A total of 480 case fatalities were reported in a span of 24 hours, it added.Ten states and Union territories accounted for 73.54 per cent of the new deaths.

24-11-2020||Chennai||Indian teenage trafficking survivor wins 'unprecedented' compensation||A teenage trafficking survivor has won Rs 900,000 in a rare payout that lawyers said was "unprecedented" in size under India's compensation schemes for victims.The survivor was 13 when she was trafficked from Odisha and sold to a brothel in Sonagachi, India's largest red-light district in the city of Kolkata, said her lawyer.She was rescued by anti-trafficking officials in 2016 and taken to a shelter home where she has since been living and studying.The girl, now 17, was last week awarded the compensation by a court in West Bengal, having previously testified against the three suspects in her case. One minor was convicted in 2017 for trafficking and two men are currently on trial, said the lawyer.Less than 1 per cent of trafficking survivors win compensation, a study found in January, and the amount can vary from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 10 lakh as each state in has its own scheme."This (compensation award) is unprecedented," said lawyer Saptarshi Biswas, one of the counsels for the victim and head of legal solutions at the charity International Justice Mission.Several other anti-trafficking advocates said they believed the compensation sum was one of the biggest of its kind to-date."The survivor's age, future prospects and what she would need to rebuild her life were taken into account when the compensation amount was being decided," Biswas added. "Her testimony in court was also crucial in this win."Low awareness of the compensation schemes and the demands on a victim – from swift reporting of the crime to cooperating with police and testifying in court – mean that most trafficking survivors in India miss out on redress, advocates have said.Kaushik Gupta, a lawyer with the anti-trafficking collective Tafteesh, welcomed the ruling and said the size of the compensation award could act as a precedent in future cases."However, only victims who have the support of NGOs are able to apply for compensation because most victims don't know how to go through the entire legal process," Gupta added.About 2,260 cases of human trafficking were reported in India last year, with nine in 10 related to sexual exploitation. These cases involved 6,616 victims, of whom 44 per cent were children.Basabi Rozari, director of the Kolkata shelter where the survivor lives, said the girl wanted to use the compensation money to build her own house and pursue higher education."She has lost contact with her family and wants to be independent in the future," Rozari told the Thomson Reuters Foundation."I am happy for her but am also aware that there are many who wait for years to get even smaller amounts awarded to them.“It is frustrating when their hopes are raised and the money doesn't come through quickly. I hope this time it is different." Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-teenage-trafficking-survivor-wins-unprecedented-compensation-175188

The dam is proposed to be built on Maidan River, a tributary of Kabul River which flows into Pakistan from Afghanistan.India will also launch the fourth phase of the High Impact Community Development Projects in Afghanistan, which envisages more than 100 projects worth $ 80 million (about Rs 600 crore) that India would undertake in Afghanistan.Jaishankar said India had just concluded with Afghanistan an agreement for the construction of the Shatoot dam. India had earlier built the 202-km Phul-e-Khumri transmission line that provides electricity to large parts of Kabul city.Jaishankar is leading the Indian delegation at the 2020 Afghanistan Conference being organised in the virtual mode by the UN and, Afghan and Finnish governments to reaffirm the International community’s commitment to Afghanistan during 2015-2024.In his statement, EAM emphasised India’s long term commitment to the development of Afghanistan and the benefit to its people as a contiguous neighbour and strategic partner.India’s development portfolio in Afghanistan has to-date amounted to over $ 3 billion with no part of the country untouched by the 400 plus projects that India has undertaken in its 34 provinces. More than 65,000 Afghan students have also studied in India.Jaishankar pointed out that Afghanistan’s growth has been constrained by its land-locked geography and highlighted India’s efforts to provide an alternate connectivity through Chabahar port and a dedicated air freight corridor between India and Afghanistan. India’s humanitarian assistance of 75,000 tonnes of wheat to strengthen food security of Afghanistan during the Covid pandemic has been transported through Chabahar port.India has invested heavily in peace and development in Afghanistan and believes that the gains of the last two decades must be preserved and the interests of minorities, women and vulnerable sections must be ensured. Jaishankar expressed concern regarding the increasing level of violence in Afghanistan and reiterated India’s call for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire.“As an important stakeholder, India looks forward to walking hand in hand with the people of Afghanistan and the world community in working towards a peaceful, prosperous, sovereign, democratic and united Afghanistan,’’ said a MEA release.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-inks-dam-project-to-bring-drinking-water-to-kabul-jaishankar-175186

Ramani stands by her statement. If the complainant wants to withdraw, then he may bring it on record”.Luthra, on the other hand said, “I've gone on with my matter. If the accused was apologetic... If there is any indication from them (accused and her counsel) I will ask my briefing counsel.” Briefing counsels are link between the client and a 'senior advocate'.After the submission on behalf of Ramani, Akbar's counsel said, “Let's continue on merits.” Akbar had filed the complaint against Ramani for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct around 20 years ago when he was a journalist.Ramani had said the allegations against Akbar, made in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2018, were her truth and were made in public good.Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) Ravindra Kumar Pandey, who started hearing afresh the final arguments in the case, had on Saturday asked both the parties whether there was a chance of settlement between them in the matter.ACMM Pandey started hearing afresh the final arguments in the case since the previous judge hearing the matter was transferred to another court last week.  During the hearing, Luthra informed the court about the case and Akbar's statement recorded earlier.She also informed the court about the statements recorded by the witnesses appearing for Akbar earlier.The court will take up the matter on December 2.Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani on October 15, 2018. He had resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by using adjectives such as 'media's biggest predator' that harmed his reputation.Akbar has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during #MeToo campaign against him.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar him while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.

This means the two-shot course will cost around Rs 1,400. This means the price at the launch will be two or more times cheaper than mRNA vaccines with similar efficacy levels, claimed Dmitriev.However, Sputnik V will be given free of charge for Russian citizens.RDIF and partners have launched production of the lyophilized (dry) form of the vaccine, which is stored at a temperature of +2 to +8 degrees Celsius. Such a regime enables the distribution of the vaccine in international markets, as well as expanding its use in hard-to-reach regions, including areas with tropical climates.The current agreements between RDIF and leading foreign pharmaceutical companies allow the Sputnik V vaccine to be produced abroad for 500 million people per year, starting from 2021. RDIF is currently considering additional applications from a number of countries and companies to further increase production capacity.The first international deliveries of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine will be made to customers in January 2021 based on the existing partnerships with foreign manufacturers. Those customers, who have recently submitted their requests, will be able to receive the first batches of the vaccine starting from March 2021.The second interim analysis of clinical trial data showed a 91.4% efficacy for the Sputnik V vaccine on day 28 after the first dose; vaccine efficacy is over 95 per cent 42 days after the first dose, said its makers Gamaleya Institute.  Currently, 40,000 volunteers are taking part in the Phase III double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical post-registration study of the Sputnik V vaccine in Russia, of whom more than 22,000 volunteers were vaccinated with the first dose and more than 19,000 volunteers with the first and second doses.There were no unexpected adverse events during the trials. Monitoring of the participants is ongoing.The Sputnik V vaccine is based on a human adenoviral vector platform that has seen more than 250 clinical trials globally conducted during the past two decades. The Russian vaccine uses two different human adenoviral vectors which allows for a stronger and longer-term immune response as compared to the vaccines using one and the same vector for two doses.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russia-aims-at-20-dollar-vaccine-in-india-by-january-175176

The Mayor said he is on the committee which decides about street and square issues. He will be very happy to help,” representatives of the Sitar Organisation for Immigrant Jews in Eilat told PTI.“In addition, he suggested to even set up an India-Israel friendship square or Mahatma Gandhi Square where the memorial stone for the victims of Mumbai attacks could also be placed,” they said.The Chabad Movement’s Synagogue in the city is going to put up a plaque in the memory of six Jewish victims at the Chabad House in the attacks.“Rav Hecht has selected a wall inside the synagogue entranceway to put up a 3A paper size plaque. The message to be engraved on a hard plastic plate is written by the Rabbi himself,” the Sitar Organisation said.In a sombre ceremony last week, the Chabad House in Beersheva paid respects to the victims of 26/11 attacks, expressing outrage at the “senseless murders and killings” and emphasising on the “shared pains” with India.The 12th anniversary of the Mumbai terror attacks, as per the Jewish calendar, fell on November 17.“Rabbi Gavriel and Rivka Holtzberg, the Chabad emissaries who were killed in the dastardly attacks in Mumbai are remembered every year by the whole movement as our representatives in almost 4,000 centres across the world meet at this time. This year we had a ‘virtual meeting’ due to Coronavirus restrictions and we took a pause to pay our respects to the victims of the attack in Mumbai,” Rabbi Zalman Gorlik, the Head of the Chabad House in Beersheva had said.The current emissary of the movement in Mumbai, Israel Kozlovski, on the 12th anniversary of the attacks as the per the Jewish calendar, held the circumcision ceremony of his newborn son, Yosef Moshe Kozlovski, in the same room and at the same place where Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife, along with other Jews, were murdered in the Mumbai attacks. Kozlovski has named one of his other sons after Rabbi Gavriel. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/israelis-planning-memorial-for-victims-of-26-11-mumbai-attacks-175172

24-11-2020||New Delhi||Will go by scientific advice on Covid vaccine, don’t have many answers yet: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said India would go by scientific advice in respect of Covid-19 vaccine and answers to questions related to the vaccine were not yet available.Speaking to chief ministers of eight worst Covid-affected states, the PM said a comprehensive plan for vaccine administration rollout would soon be ready and asked states to set up steering committees and structures down to block level to ensure inoculation as and when the vaccine came.The PM, however, made it clear that he did not yet have answers on vaccine dosage, pricing or sourcing although the government was in touch with local and global developers, nations and multilateral institutions to ensure vaccine procurement.Also read: As Modi holds virtual meeting with CMs, Kejriwal blames Covid spike on pollution, Mamata demands GST duesThe PM was speaking a day after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted saying the PM should tell the country which vaccine India would use.Addressing CMs of Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Delhi, Bengal, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, the PM expressed grave concern on what he called “widespread carelessness around Covid-19 precautions”.The laxity over Covid is widespread, said the PM, terming resurgence in some states as worrisome.The PM said while the vaccine planning progressed there could be no complacency regarding practising Covid-appropriate behaviour.“The carelessness around Covid-19 precautions is widespread. We have to absolutely reawaken the people to the dangers of the virus. Let’s not forget India has emerged from a deep ocean of crisis and we don’t want to drown in shallow waters. So I urge the states to step up awareness campaigns and reduce fatality rate below 1 per cent and positivity rate under 5 per cent. The share of RTPCR in Covid testing must increase,” the PM told the CMs.He said the development of Covid vaccine was at final stages but many questions were yet to be answered. “We will go by scientific advice on the issue,” the PM said noting that India is in touch with all stakeholders.“But it is not yet final as to what vaccine dosage would help, what the pricing would be. We don’t have answers to these questions. There are issues here. Corporate completions, the nation’s involvement at diplomatic level. There are many interests at play,” the PM said.He said India had to move on Covid vaccine front from a global perspective.“We are in touch with Indian developers, global developers, multilateral institutions and nations. We have created mechanisms for wide engagement across levels. After the vaccine comes our priority would be to reach the vaccine to all. Smooth systematic and sustainable vaccination campaign is the challenge, and we will all have to work as a team,” he said.The PM said India would have a huge role in vaccine production. “Indian experience on vaccines is vast, one which no other nation has. We can deliver vaccines with speed safety. Our vaccines will be top on all standards,” assured the PM.He said priority groups for vaccine administration would be fixed based on state inputs and added that additional cold storage must be created by states.Preparations must start on augmenting cold storage, the PM advised. He said a “comprehensive plan on vaccine delivery will soon be ready. The Centre has asked states to create steering committees and task forces till block level. Committees must meet and get trained.We have to create vaccine administration efforts while we fight Covid,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-go-by-scientific-advice-on-covid-vaccine-dont-have-many-answers-yet-modi-175160
24-11-2020||Kolkata||Bengal fully geared for Covid-19 vaccination programme: Mamata Banerjee||Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said West Bengal was fully ready to launch the Covid-19 vaccination programme in the state.The Chief Minister said West Bengal was fully prepared with trained manpower and required infrastructure (including cold chain) for the vaccination drive.“We are ready to work with central government and all other stakeholders to ensure speedy and universal vaccination for everyone as soon as the vaccine is available,” the Chief Minister said.Taking part in a meeting held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with chief ministers of various states to discuss the COVID-19 situation through video conferencing, Banerjee said the entire nation was now looking forward to an early vaccination programme.The Chief Minister said West Bengal government was ready to join the Union Government and all stakeholders for a comprehensive battle against the pandemic.Banerjee, who is said to be upset over the central government treating West Bengal as among the states reporting a surge in Covid cases, claimed success in containing Covid in the state despite major festivals and resumption of the mass public transport system.She said the onset of the Durgapuja-Kalipuja-Chath puja season saw festivities in the state. Sub-urban train operations have also resumed here to facilitate commuting by common people. Yet, West Bengal has been successful in reducing the infection and the death rate, she said.Notably, West Bengal, where the infection rate had touched over 4,000 daily and deaths had peaked to over 60 every day, has been witnessing a steady decline in these figures. The state reported 47 Covid deaths and 3,557 fresh infections on Monday (November 23). The recovery rate was 92.80 per cent while the number of the sample tested was 42,367.The corresponding figure on October 23 was 60 deaths and 4,143 fresh cases. The recovery rate was 87.45 per cent. The number of samples tested on October 23 was 44,582.Banerjee pointed out that people from neighbouring states also come to West Bengal for treatment and they were never turned away. Under the circumstances West Bengal has been performing “remarkably well” when compared with similarly placed metropolitan regions of the country, she said.Mamata, however, said that release of adequate funds by the central government would have been a welcome step but this was not being done. “The dues on account of GST compensation to the tune of Rs 8,500 crore have accumulated for West Bengal,” she said and added that expenses were increasing on all fronts.The state has already spent around Rs 4,000 crore on account of Covid management but till now GOI has released only Rs 193 crore for this purpose, Mamata complained.Taking a dig at Union Home Minister Amit Shah (Shah was present at the meeting with Modi), who recently toured Bengal, Banerjee said rallies and political one-upmanship should be avoided at the time pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengal-fully-geared-for-covid-19-vaccination-programme-mamata-banerjee-175159

This is in the teeth of Article 32. How dare this officer write something like this in his letter?” the Bench headed had asked.“We have a serious question on the author of this letter and we find it extremely difficult to overlook this,” the CJI had said.The Bench had appointed senior advocate Arvind Datar as amicus curiae and posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.An angry CJI had told senior advocate AM Singhvi, representing the Maharashtra Government, to look into the conduct of the officer concerned.The CJI’s outburst had come after senior advocate Harish Salve, representing Goswami, told the Bench that the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Secretary wrote a letter to Goswami on October 13 threatening the Republic TV editor-in-chief for “breaching” confidentiality of privilege proceedings by moving the top court.The Bench had granted protection from arrest to Goswami in this case as Salve urged the court to protect him from any coercive action by the Privileges Committee of the assembly.Pointing out that “cases after cases” were being filed against Goswami, Salve had said: “Constitutional courts have to see the reality, not the smokescreen.”The Assembly Secretary, who had already been served with a notice on Arnab’s petition, had written a letter to Goswami threatening him for approaching the court.Terming the letter written by the Secretary of the Assembly as unprecedented, the Bench said it had a tendency to bring the administration of justice to disrepute and it amounted to interference with the administration of the justice.“The intention of the author (Assembly Secretary) seems to intimidate the petitioner (Goswami) because he approached this court and threaten him with a penalty for doing so,” the top court said.In its order, the court had said the Assembly Secretary must know that the right to approach the Supreme Court under Article 32 itself was a fundamental right.“There is no doubt that if a citizen is deterred from exercising his right under Article 32, it will amount to serious interference with the administration of justice” it said.The top court had on September 30 issued a notice to Maharashtra Assembly Secretary on Goswami’s petition challenging a notice for breach of privilege issued to him for his alleged remarks against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/issued-letter-to-arnab-at-speakers-instance-maharashtra-assembly-assistant-secretary-tells-sc-175142

Sarith, a former employee of the UAE Consulate here, on July 5 for allegedly smuggling gold in diplomatic baggage destined for the Consulate. Swapna, who was also an ex-employee of the Consulate, and her associate Sandip Nair were also arrested by the National Investigation Agency from Bengaluru.Vijayan removed Sivasankar as his Principal Secretary, and then as the IT Secretary after it surfaced that Swapna and Sivasankar were allegedly close friends.Vijayan has all along said that he had no clue of what was happening, but the principal opposition parties -- the Congress and the BJP -- have alleged that he knew everything and is now scared that the probe may enter his office.The ED had asked Vijayan's Assistant Private Secretary C.M. Ravindran to appear before the agency. However, Ravindran after turning Covid positive could not do so. He is likely to be served the notice again after his recovery.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/customs-arrests-sivasankar-in-gold-smuggling-case-175141
24-11-2020||Mumbai||ED’s raid on Sena MLA ‘political vendetta’: Sanjay Raut||The Shiv Sena on Tuesday termed the ED’s raids on properties of party MLA Pratap Sarnaik as “political vendetta” and said the Maharashtra government or its leaders would not surrender to pressure from anyone.Talking to reporters here, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, without naming the BJP, said it should forget the dream of coming to power in Maharashtra for the next 25 years, “no matter how much pressure it exerts or spreads terror through agencies”.“If you have begun today, we know how to end it,” the Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson said.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided premises linked to Shiv Sena MLA Sarnaik in Maharashtra on Tuesday in connection with a money-laundering case.“This action is definitely a political vendetta. The ED or other agencies should not work as if a branch of a political party,” Raut said.He said Sarnaik’s properties were raided while the latter was not at home, and added that no matter how many notices were issued, only truth would prevail in Maharashtra.Raut also said there was no ban on probes by an agency and it could take action if there was evidence.“But you want to mentally harass the people related to the (state) government. These actions will backfire on you. And I think that time is nearing,” he said.The Shiv Sena, which was earlier a long-term ally of the BJP but snapped ties with it last year over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post, is in power in Maharashtra along with the NCP and Congress.“Be it the CBI or the ED, our government, MLAs and leaders will not surrender to anyone no matter what. We will keep fighting,” Raut said.Those who are trying to use pressure of agencies or want to demoralise MLAs, should keep in mind that “this is Maharashtra of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj”, he said.The Shiv Sena would not be scared if the ED set up office outside the residences of each of the party’s MLAs, MPs and leaders, the Rajya Sabha member said.Raut said he could send to the ED a list of 100 people of “a party whose orders the agency is taking” about their businesses and how their money-laundering was going on.The Shiv Sena won’t care if the central probe agencies, the judiciary and the law were going to behave as if “slaves or servants” of those in power.“No matter how many notices you send, raids you conduct, create fake documents and evidence, but in Maharashtra and in the case of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), only truth shall prevail. The motto of ‘Satyamev Jayate’ can win only in Maharashtra,” the Shiv Sena leader said.Asked about the ED’s notice to NCP chief Sharad Pawar last year, Raut said let them make arrests if they want.

She broke down and insisted that she possessed a medical degree but it was on her earlier name," said Thilagar Thidal police inspector G Kavitha, who rounded up a group of transgenders for reportedly begging and troubling traders here, recently.The police, after verifying the documents, got in touch with the doctors from Madurai Medical College, and corroborated the fact that the transsexual doctor, was a male in college.Only recently she landed in the midst of transgenders to beg as she had no means to sustain herself, after being sacked from a hospital here.The surprised inspector then took up the case of the transsexual doctor with her superiors, to extend all possible help.For her part Kavitha provided her a stethoscope and a doctors coat."I don't see any problem in changing her records with the MCI. Her rights can't be denied.But first she has to notify the name change in the gazette which will serve as a government order," said Kalki Subramaniam, a celebrated Indian transgender activist, artist, poet, actor and inspirational speaker.Speaking to PTI on Tuesday, Kalki, founder of Sahodari Foundation, an organisation which works for Indian transgender, said, "it is nothing but human rights violation to deny her job based on her gender."The hospital cannot sack a person based on gender and may have to reinstate if the said doctor gets a court ruling in her favour, Kalki remarked.Recalling the 2014 Supreme Court order, Kalki said the apex court verdict recognising the transgender community as a third gender along with male and female, is clearly in favour of the doctor too.The apex court had also affirmed that the fundamental rights granted under the Constitution of India will be equally applicable to them, and gave them the right to self- identification of their gender as male, female or third gender.

24-11-2020||Guwahati||Tarun Gogoi sets on his final journey, sea of people pay tributes||"Baad Diya He" (just leave it) -- a phrase that former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi often uttered when faced with a quandary. And when he departed from the world, people fondly remember him as a leader who never left them in difficult times.Gogoi's final journey began on Tuesday morning from Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), where he breathed his last due to post-COVID-19 complications, to his official residence in Dispur.The 84-year-old Congress politician died here on Monday while undergoing treatment. He is survived by wife Dolly, daughter Chandrima and son Gaurav.Officials said Gogoi would be cremated with full state honours on November 26.His body was embalmed at the hospital and brought to his residence.The veteran politician's son and Lok Sabha MP Gaurav Gogoi, accompanied by senior leaders and hundreds of supporters, received the body from GMCH, which was then taken out in a procession.His glass coffin, wrapped in flowers, was shouldered by Gaurav, Congress Assam unit chief Ripun Bora, Leader of the Opposition Debabrata Saikia and other senior leaders such as Pradyut Bordoloi and Rakibul Hussain.Many senior leaders and legislators accompanied the veteran Congress leader's cortege along the arterial Guwahati-Shillong Road.Passersby offered floral tributes to their former CM."I am 75 years old and haven't stepped out of home since the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Today, however, I came out to bid farewell to our beloved leader," said Ramani Sharma, a resident of Tarun Nagar locality, as he stood amid a sea of people on the GS Road.Hiranya Sarma, another local in his 40s, said Gogoi led Assam is one of the most difficult phases, when salaries were put on hold for nearly two years, the insurgency was at its peak, secret killings were rampant and nobody dared to leave home after sunset."He was a central minister and a six-time MP. He could have enjoyed a luxurious life in Delhi, but he came back for us. He did not leave us in difficult times. We, the youths, had no future. But he changed that scenario completely," Sarma added.Congress spokesperson Rhituporna Konwar, who, for years, had been handling the media for Gogoi, said he never hesitated to call a spade a spade."He even wore the black robe after nearly four decades to fight against the Citizenship Amendment Act in the Supreme Court. He was a man who lived his life for the people of the state and Northeast region at large," he added.Scores of people and leaders cutting across party lines were also seen gathering at Gogoi's official residence in Dispur to pay their last respects.      From there, the body was taken to Janata Bhawan, the state secretariat, from where Gogoi served people for 15 years as the chief minister.Among others, Chief Secretary Jishnu Barua and DGP Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta were present at the building.Gogoi is credited with setting up Janata Bhawan as the permanent secretariat of the state.Later in the day, the mortal remains would be transferred to Congress headquarters Rajiv Bhawan for the party workers to pay their homage.As per the family's wish, the mortal remains will then be taken to Srimanta Sankardeva Kalakshetra complex in Guwahati in the evening. People will be allowed to catch a final glimpse of the grand old man all of November 25.Gogoi would be cremated in Guwahati on Thursday instead of his hometown Titabor. However, people from his constituency are demanding that his last rites be performed in his home district."As per Gogoi's wish, the body will be taken to a temple, mosque and church before the last rites," the Congress state unit chief had earlier said.Many central leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, are likely to visit Assam over the next two days to pay their last respects to Gogoi.The Assam government has announced a three-day state mourning in honour of Gogoi. The BJP, Congress, AGP and other political parties also cancelled all party functions, including the ongoing election campaign for the Bodoland Territorial Council polls, for the period.

The margin of profit is so high as it is as high as 1400 per cent in Andhra Pradesh and 1200 per cent in Delhi,” said the petition filed by advocate Ajay Agrawal.It claimed that the RT-PCR kits were presently available for less than rupees 200 in the Indian market.“There is no other cost as the machines used for the RT-PCR test are already there with the laboratories as they conduct a large number of tests. And the matter is concerned with 135 crore citizens of the country as everybody worried about the coronavirus and forced to get their test done at this exorbitant price,” it said.It alleged that the owners of the private laboratories and hospitals are using the calamity into opportunities for minting crores and crores of rupees. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-centres-response-on-pil-seeking-to-fix-maximum-rate-for-rt-pcr-test-175134

24-11-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai Police file charge sheet in fake TRP scam||The Mumbai Police on Tuesday filed a charge sheet in a court here in the alleged TRP (Television Rating Points) rigging scam.The charge sheet was submitted before a magistrate's court by the police's Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU), which is conducting a probe into the case, an official said.The crime branch has so far arrested 12 persons, including Republic TV's western region distribution head and owners of two other channels, in connection with the case, he said.The fake TRP scam came to light last month when ratings agency Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) filed a complaint through Hansa Research Group, alleging that certain television channels were rigging TRP numbers.Hansa had been tasked with installing barometers, which record viewership data (which channel has been watched and for how long) at sample households.TRP is important as advertising revenue of channels depends on it.Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh last month claimed thatRepublic TVand two Marathi channelsBox CinemaandFakt Marathi- were involved in manipulating TRPs.Republic TV and other accused have denied wrongdoing and manipulation of the TRP system.Earlier, Republic TV's Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and two Chief Operating Officers (COO) and Chief Finance Officer (CFO) were summoned by the police for questioning in the fake TRP racket case.The statements of Republic TV's executive editor Niranjan Narayanswamy and senior executive editor Abhishek Kapoor were also recorded by the police.The Maharashtra government last month withdrew its "general consent" given to the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe cases in the state, in the wake of the CBI taking over a case registered by Uttar Pradesh Police against "unknown" channels and persons over alleged fudging of TRP.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) recently filed a money laundering complaint in the alleged TRP rigging scam being investigated by the Mumbai Police.The central probe agency has filed an enforcement case information report (ECIR) that is equivalent to a police FIR under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, official sources said last week.The ED complaint was filed after studying a Mumbai Police FIR that was registered in October and it had named the Republic TV channel, two Marathi channels and few other individuals.

The respondent occupies a unique office. He is the PM of India,” the top court had noted.“Why should we grant you liberty for adjournment. You are abusing the process of law. You argue,” the CJI had told Bahadur’s counsel declining his request refused to adjourn the hearing, noting if his nomination was rightly or wrongly rejected depended on his eligibility.The counsel submitted that Bahadur had earlier filed his nomination as an independent candidate and later as a candidate of the Samajwadi Party.The Returning Officer rejected his nomination papers on May 1, 2019, observing that “the nomination paper is not accompanied by a certificate issued in the prescribed manner by the Election Commission to the effect that he has not been dismissed for corruption or disloyalty to the state”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rejects-ex-bsf-mans-petition-challenging-modis-election-from-varanasi-175127

The rest of the details will come in another one week. We have asked the states to accelerate the process,” an official source said.The anti-coronavirus vaccine, once available, would be distributed under a special COVID-19 inoculation programme, using the processes, technology and network of the existing Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP). It would run parallel to the UIP.The Centre, with the help of state and UT governments, had started the process of identifying around 30 crore priority beneficiaries, who would be given vaccine dose in the initial phase, sources had said.The government has demarcated four categories, which includes around one crore healthcare professionals, including doctors, MBBS students, nurses and ASHA workers etc; around two crore frontline workers, including municipal corporation workers, personnel of the police and armed forces; about 26 crore people aged above 50 and a special category of those below 50 with co-morbidities and requiring specialised care.Health Ministry’s existing digital platform eVIN, which is being used for the UIP, is being enhanced for the COVID-19 vaccine distribution and delivery, through which SMSs would be sent to recipients informing the time, date and venue to get the shots and digitally connect them and also track them, sources had earlier said.“Each person in the immunisation list would be linked with their Aadhar cards to avoid duplication and to track beneficiaries. However, in case a person doesn’t have an Aadhar card, a government photo identity can be used,” the sources said.Five vaccines are under different phases of the clinical trial in India with the Serum Institute of India conducting the phase-3 trial of the Oxford-Astrazeneca COVID-19 vaccine while the indigenously developed Bharat Biotech and ICMR vaccine has already started the phase III clinical trial.Indigenously developed vaccine by Zydus Cadila has completed phase-2 clinical trial in the country.Dr Reddy’s Laboratories will soon start combined phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Russian COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V in India. Biological E Ltd has started early phase 1 and 2 human trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had said a COVID-19 vaccine was likely to be available by the first quarter of 2021.He had said the Centre estimated to receive and utilise 40 to 50 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccine covering around 25 crore people by July next year.“The prioritisation of groups for COVID-19 vaccine shall be based on two key considerations — occupational hazard and risk of exposure to infection, and the risk of developing severe disease and increased mortality,” he had said.

A lot of your important data can be derived from your conversation on WhatsApp and that is exactly why the hackers have chosen WhatsApp to collect your sensitive data.The scam which is currently doing the rounds lets scammers hack into your WhatsApp account using an OTP. You could get a message on WhatsApp from an unknown number or from a friend’s number claiming that he/she is in some sort of emergency. The hacker will then ask you for an OTP, which he will claim that he has sent to your number mistakenly.When you get messages like this, do not indulge in any further conversation or send the OTP code, which actually provides access to your WhatsApp account.If you send the OTP code to the hacker, you will be locked out of your own WhatsApp account. This would give full control of your account to the hacker. He can then misuse the access and reach out to your other friends following the same tricks. The hacker can also collect sensitive data or conversations that are meant to be private.Similarly, even when you get a message from a known contact asking for an OTP pin, do not respond immediately or follow his request. You can first call him to verify whether the message was sent by him or was his WhatsApp account.

While the ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, led by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, rediscovered faith in alliance with the saffron party after the recent Dubakka win, the party is also sensing fresh hope in uncharted regions, especially in Telangana and Andhra.While in Telangana the BJP election machine has turned a local bodies’ election — the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls — into a national event replete with saffron verbosity and star campaigners, in Tamil Nadu, reports are suggesting favourable vibes from elusive superstar Rajinikanth after Home Minister Amit Shah’s recent visit.Shah’s Tamil Nadu visit is being seen as a major success by the BJP and its reinforced ally AIADMK. Though Shah’s message to senior leaders was clear that the party should build and expand on its own merits and not be dependent on celebrities and outsiders etc, sources say the megastar has conveyed his “feelings” to Shah via RSS ideologue S Gurumuruthy, who had met him recently.Likewise, MK Alagiri, son of late chief minister M Karunanidhi, who also sent his “intent of support” via KP Ramalingam, an ousted DMK leader who joined the BJP.Notably, Dubakka has given the BJP much to hope in Telangana and also neighbouring Andhra Pradesh where the party fared rather poorly in the last elections. Considered a bastion of KCR family, Dubakka is close to Gajwel, which is represented by Chief Minister KCR, Sircilla, his son KT Rama Rao’s constituency, and Siddipet, his nephew T Harish Rao’s seat.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-southern-dream-falls-in-place-175100

Don't make religion a political tool," Jahan said in reply to a question during a media interaction here.The Bengali actor-turned-politician is married to businessman Nikhil Jain.Earlier, Jahan had participated in the festivities of Durga Puja for which she came under severe attacks by radical Islamists for committing a 'sin' and bringing disrepute to Islam.The issue was that the actress was seen playing the dhaak, folding hands before Goddess Durga and dancing to the beats of dhak (improvised drums) in celebration of Bengali's biggest festival Durga Puja this year.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/love-and-jihad-dont-go-together-says-trinamool-mp-nusrat-jahan-175097

24-11-2020||NEW DELHI||Youthful House ensured landmark laws: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the country was witnessing Parliament working with new energy and drew a parallel with the tenure of the Lok Sabha since 2014 as one of youthful exuberance in enacting several landmark legislations and taking historic decisions.Inaugurates 76 modern flatsIt is said the 16-17-18 age-group when the youth is in classes X-XII, is very important. These ages are equally important for any young democracy. “You see, now, with the 2019 elections, we have completed the term of the 16th Lok Sabha. This period has been very historic for the development and progress of the country. The term of 17th Lok Sabha has started after 2019. This Lok Sabha has also made history with the decisions and steps taken in the country during this period. There will be 18th Lok Sabha after this. I am sure the next Lok Sabha will also play a very important role to take the country forward in the new decade.”At the inauguration of 76 modern flats for Members of Parliament through video-conference, he said all MPs had taken care of both products and the process in the productivity of Parliament, and attained new heights in this direction.Observing that another major reason behind the energy in Parliament is on account of young and new MPs, he said, since 2014, the country wanted to move in a new direction and more than 300 MPs, including him, were elected for the first time. “In this 17th Lok Sabha also, there are 260 MPs, who have been elected for the first time. More than 400 MPs either have come for the first time or have reached Parliament for the second time in 2019.Praising Speaker Om Birla, PM Modi expressed happiness that Parliament proceedings continued even during the pandemic. The new flats came in space occupied by eight bungalows that were 80 years’ old. Accommodation for MPs has been a longstanding problem but is now being solved. Problems that persist for decades cannot end by avoiding them but by finding solutions, he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/youthful-house-ensured-landmark-laws-modi-175011

24-11-2020||NEW DELHI||Tibet, Nepal intrigues back in focus after long||The Great Game on the Roof of the World is beginning to get intriguing as existing players have begun jettisoning over half a century of status quo. World attention is currently focused on the China-India face off in eastern Ladakh, but intrigues relating to Tibet and the surrounding territories controlled by India, Nepal and Bhutan are making a comeback.China has ingressed into the Bhutanese territory by building a road in an area that India considers a security risk to the Chicken’s Neck corridor connecting the mainland to the North East, said sources here. So far, there was reasoned speculation about the Chinese building a village as well as a road towards Jampheri Ridge.Reports of a similar nature have come from Nepal but have been denied as well. However, China is now attempting to put in place an all-weather link to Nepal that will serve as a more reliable avenue for commerce.In India, Arunachal CM Pema Khandu has repeatedly said the state does not share a direct border with China but with Tibet. In June, days after the Galwan clash, Khandu had for the first time referred to the LAC as the India-Tibet border. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tibet-nepal-intrigues-back-in-focus-after-long-175015

On November 3, the Bench had said investigation into the “larger conspiracy” behind Rajiv Gandhi’ assassination need not deter the Governor from deciding clemency plea of Perarivalan, who has been in prison for more than two decades.The CBI told the Supreme Court last week that the Tamil Nadu Governor was the competent authority to take call on his remission plea.In an affidavit filed last week, the CBI said the issue of remission of sentence was solely between Governor Banwarilal Purohit and Perarivalan and it was for the Governor to decide whether to release him.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-extends-parole-of-rajiv-gandhis-killer-perarivalan-for-medical-check-up-175019

The developers said they aimed to supply three billion doses globally during 2021. The announcement bodes well for India where phase-3 trials of the Oxford vaccine are underway, so is the production.Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India, manufacturing partner in the global collaboration, said, “I am delighted to hear that Covishield, a low-cost, logistically manageable and soon to be widely available Covid-19 vaccine, will offer up to 90 per cent protection in one type of dosage regime and 62 per cent in the other dosage regime.”The preliminary data shows the vaccine is 70.4 per cent effective when combining data from two dosing regimens (90 per cent effective if administered at a half dose and then at a full dose and 62 per cent effective if administered in two full doses). There were no hospitalisations or severe cases in anyone who received the vaccine.The developers said the vaccine could be easily administered in existing healthcare systems, stored at ‘fridge temperature’ (2-8°C) and distributed using existing logistics.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covishield-trials-show-90-efficacy-174976
24-11-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Amid LAC standoff, key Army posts lying vacant for months||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 23Last Friday when the Ministry of Defence (MoD) okayed the posting of Lt Gen SK Sharma, Commander of the Jalandhar-based 11 Corps, as the next Director General of Military Intelligence (DGMI), the Army finally got a regular DGMI.New heads awaitedDGMI appointed after 6 wksPromotions put off tooTardy handling by new Dept of Military AffairsThe post had been vacant for more than six weeks, which was unusual in itself. The DGMI, as the name suggests, coordinates various human sourced and technical inputs on enemy movement and own action along the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan and the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China.In what is a further indication of the slow decision-making, the crucial posts of Director General of Infantry and Director General of Aviation have been vacant for several months even as Indian armed forces face a belligerent China. The DG of Infantry is tasked to advise the Army Chief on matters of equipment, battle worthiness and training of Infantry, the largest fighting arm of the Army.The DG studies, formulates and recommends concepts on deployment of Infantry. He is responsible for modernisation and introduction of new weapons, vehicles and equipment. It is the infantry that is largely deployed along the LoC and the LAC.The DG of Army Aviation is in charge of all flying operations, including new raisings. The Army has a fleet of 350 helicopters, mostly used in the high Himalayas to reach supplies to outposts and for rescue efforts.Promotions and postings of 39 officers in the ranks of Major General and Lt General were cleared last week. Most of these were pending for over 4-5 months, raising scepticism over the creation of the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) and its task of bringing in efficiency and speedily addressing matters.The process of promotions and postings of officers was taken away from the Department of Defence (DoD) and handed over to the DMA, when it was created in January this year.The Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, is the Secretary of the DMA reporting directly to Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, whose office takes a final call on matters of the DMA. The immediate staff of the DMA, including those at the Joint Secretary level, are from the three forces.The process of posting of officers and files for promotions used to take two months when the DoD handled it, but the present case of 39 Generals was clearly delayed, and only a part of the blame can be apportioned to the Covid-19 crisis.The selection board for the Lt Colonels who are to be promoted as Colonels is running behind schedule by six months, a source confirmed. The last selection board to promote Colonels as Brigadiers was declassified – military word for declaring the outcome – after six months of the meeting of the selection board. It is normally declassified within two months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-lac-standoff-key-army-posts-lying-vacant-for-months-174999

24-11-2020||Guwahati||Longest-serving Assam CM Tarun Gogoi broke the back of insurgency||Tarun Gogoi, the octogenarian three-time Chief Minister of Assam, who breathed his last on Monday evening, was one of northeast India's tallest statesmen who changed the face of Assam from a terrorism-ravaged state to a land with opportunities for trade, business and economy during his 15-year reign.Was admitted to hospital on Aug 26 after testing Covid+veA six-time MP from Assam between 1971 and 2001, Gogoi (86) was away from Assam politics for long until in 2001 Assembly polls when he was asked to lead the party against the influential Asom Gana Parishad government led by Prafulla Kumar Mahanta.When other leaders were hesitant, Gogoi led the Congress to victory and became the Chief Minister for the first time in 2001, leading the state at a very difficult time with terrorism at its peak and brutal killings dominating the headlines.The longest-serving Chief Minister of Assam, Gogoi took the helm of affairs of the state in 2001 when the state was also facing a serious financial crisis even as the state government did not have the required money to pay salaries of government employees on time. Between 2001 and 2016, the 15 years he was in power, Gogoi scripted history by taming the decades' old insurgency as terror outfits and militants came forward to talk with the government. Under his leadership, the economic growth accompanied by peace boosted Assam to accelerate its all-round development during the subsequent years.He dealt with the occasional flare-up like the 2012 Kokrajhar and other ethnic violence in the state with an iron hand.Born to Dr Kamaleshwar Gogoi and Usha Gogoi, Tarun Gogoi spent his childhood in a tea garden in Jorhat district where his father was a physician. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/longest-serving-assam-cm-tarun-gogoi-broke-the-back-of-insurgency-175009
