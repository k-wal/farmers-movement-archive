We have got an assessment report from 24 villages. The results are impressive,” Kejriwal said.“We have found a solution to the problem of stubble burning, but will state governments implement it,” he asked.This is a “very easy and cost-effective” solution. Now, no government can say there is no alternative to the problem. The report says it just costs Rs 30 per acre, which can be given out of a state’s own budget, Kejriwal said.

Upon reaching the immigration counter, I was escorted to a room on the pretext that there was some error in my passport,” Wani, who represented Pahalgam assembly seat, told PTI here.For nearly three hours, says Wani, there was no clarity as to why he was stopped.“I convinced my family to go ahead while I requested the immigration officials to give me some clarity.“After nearly three hours, my passport was handed over and I had to return to my accommodation in Delhi. Before that, I had to make some purchases because my luggage was checked in amid the confusion,” he said, adding that he has been conveyed that he cannot travel till March 2021.The Jammu and Kashmir administration had handed over a list of around 37 people post August 5 last year when the special status of the erstwhile state was abrogated and it was converted into two union territories.The list at that time contained names of political leaders from National Conference, PDP, JK People’s Conference including Ali Mohammed Sagar, Abdul Rahim Rather, Nayeem Akhtar, Sajjad Lone his brother Bilal Lone, Wani, Basharat Bukhari among others.The list was initially valid for three months after which it was validated further after a review, the sources said.It was, however, pruned and the number came down to 33 after some of leaders, who formed Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party including its chief Altaf Bukhari, were taken off from the look out notice. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-nc-mla-prevented-from-boarding-flight-to-dubai-170226

13-11-2020||London||Rishi Sunak lights up Downing Street with Diwali decorations||UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak marked the festival of Diwali by stepping out of his No. 11 Downing Street home in London to lay out a rangoli decoration and light four diyas at the doorstep.The 40-year-old Indian-origin finance minister, who is married to Akshata Murthy – the daughter of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy, has spoken about being a “proud Hindu” over the years.His celebratory gesture on Thursday night marks a first for Downing Street, which annually sees the UK Prime Minister host a Diwali gathering and an Annakut, or spread of festive food, from London's Swaminarayan Mandir next door at No. 10.Sunak's message this Diwali was for British Hindus to follow the lockdown rules and refrain from the usual tradition of getting together with friends and family.“I know how difficult it is not to be able to see each other,” Sunak said.“Just a couple more weeks and we are going to get through this and it's going to be so much better on the other side. We will have lots of happy times afterwards. But, to keep everyone safe right now, just follow the rules,” he said.Diwali -- which symbolises the spiritual victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance -- will be celebrated on Saturday.Lockdown restrictions in England and varying degrees of restrictions across most parts of the United Kingdom have meant that temples and gurdwaras are turning more towards virtual festivities this year."Faith is important to me, I'm a practising Hindu, I pray with my kids, visit the temple when I can – at the moment rather less so because I'm busy,” Sunak told the BBC."For us as Hindus, Diwali is special, and it's going to be difficult this year. But we've got Zoom, we've got the phone, and most importantly, we've got each other. Whether you can see someone or not the bond of family, that bond of love is always going to be there. And it will be there on December 3 as well," he said, in reference to England's current strict stay-at-home lockdown coming to an end on December 2.Earlier this week, Sunak, who has been at the forefront of Britain's economic response to the pandemic, had unveiled details of one of his new schemes in place to help counter youth unemployment.The 2-billion pound Kickstarter Scheme, which has been designed to give 16-24-year olds a future of hope by creating high-quality, government-subsidised jobs, has created 19,672 jobs since it began last week.“Our country's future will be built by the next generation, so it's vital that we harness the talent of young people as we rebuild from the pandemic,” he said.“But this isn't just about kickstarting our economy, we're giving opportunity and hope to thousands of young people, kickstarting their careers and offering them a brighter future,” he said.His other measures, including furlough or wage support for struggling businesses and Bounce Back Loans, have also received the backing of industry and business groups.The minister has repeatedly warned of “hard times” ahead for the British economy, even as the latest figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that the country's third-quarter growth was the highest since records began in 1955 and came as restrictions were eased after the first lockdown for Sunak's popular 'Eat Out to Help Out' discount scheme.The economic growth surged by a record 15.5 per cent between July and September as the UK rebounded out of recession in the summer.“There are still hard times ahead, but we will continue to support people and ensure nobody is left without hope or opportunity,” said Sunak, as he welcomed the temporary bounce.“The steps we've had to take since to halt the spread of the virus mean growth has likely slowed further since then. But there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic on the health side – including promising news on tests and vaccines,” he said.

The margin of profit is so high as it is as high as 1400 per cent in Andhra Pradesh and 1200 per cent in Delhi,” said the petition filed by advocate Ajay Agrawal.It claimed that the RT-PCR kits are presently available for less than rupees 200 in the Indian market. “There is no other cost as the machines used of RT-PCR test are already there with the laboratories as they conduct large number of tests.             “And the matter is concerned with 135 crore citizens of the country as everybody worried with the coronavires and forced to get their test done at this exorbitant price,” it said.It alleged that the owner of the private laboratories and hospitals are using the calamity into opportunity for minting crores and crores of rupees.

13-11-2020|| Hyderabad||Owaisi meeting with KCR leads to political speculations||After winning five seats in the Bihar State Assembly Elections the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) is all geared to take on bigger political parties in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) elections scheduled for December this year.The Hyderabad MP and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi met Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) on Friday and reportedly discussed a strategy to take on the BJP and Congress collectively. Though the meeting is being described as a routine one for the exchange of Diwali greetings, but political observers feel that the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi and the AIMIM will contest the elections in consultation to keep other parties in check. TRS and All AIMIM are political allies ever since the formation of the state of Telangana in 2014. In the 30-minute meeting between Owaisi and KCR at the latter’s residence two are believed to have discussed the ground realities faced by AIMIM in Bihar where it was pitched against the NDA and other parties. Back home in Telangana the TRS lost the Dubbak by-poll to the BJP, which is also believed to have been discussed. Sources said that in the meeting, which has assumed a political significance, the two reportedly discussed the prospects of winning seats by their respective parties and also the possibility of seat-sharing for the GHMC elections. The GHMC has 150 divisions, where the TRS won 99 seats in the previous elections and the AIMIM had won 44, leaving only six for other parties.  The GHMC elections assume importance from a state’s perspective as there are many assemblies and Parliamentary segments that are directly influenced by those who win the GHMC seats are these areas adjoin assembly and Parliamentary constituencies. The GHMC area covers 650 square kilometres and is spread over four districts—Hyderabad, Ranga Reddy, Medchal–Malkajgiri and Sangareddy.  The recent devastating floods, which have affected Hyderabad and urban infrastructure to a large extent, are going to be the main issue that is expected to play out in the GHMC elections. TRS and AIMIM could have a pre-poll alliance or a post-poll alliance, it is said. The state Election Commission officials are expected to release the notification for the polls after Diwali.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/owaisi-meeting-with-kcr-leads-to-political-speculations-170208

Realise the importance of ‘A’ in your name Amruta.“Don’t bring bad thoughts in your mind during the auspicious occasion of Diwali,” Shiv Sena spokesperson Neelam Gorhe, who is also deputy chairperson in the Legislative Council, said in a statement here.Gorhe said, “You will not benefit by calling the Shiv Sena names.”“What is going on exactly? The Shav Sena did kill its own colleague (Congress) in Bihar. No matter where they are taking Maharashtra, but thanks for putting Bihar at right place,” Amruta Fadnavis, a banker, had tweeted.Devendra Fadnavis, a former chief minister of Maharashtra, was the BJP’s election in-charge in Bihar, where his party put up a stellar show.The Sena had contested certain assembly seats in Bihar, but failed to open its account and most of its candidates lost their security deposit (getting votes less than EC-mandated threshold).The Congress, which fought in alliance with the RJD, won only 19 of the 70 seats it contested in Bihar with many observers blaming its poor show for the opposition bloc’s electoral loss.The Sena and the Congress are part of the ruling coalition in Maharashtra.

13-11-2020|| Hyderabad||Telangana bans the sale and bursting of crackers||The Telangana Government has issued orders following a high court directive banning the sale and use of firecrackers in the state during Diwali.The orders were issued on Friday a day after a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Telangana High Court resulted in the court directing the government to ban the sale and use of crackers.  The Government Order (GO) reads: “Keeping in view the directions of the High Court, hereby impose a ban on the sale and use of firecrackers by the people and organisations, with immediate effect”. The government has directed the Director-General of Police, Director General of Fire Services, District Collectors, Commissioners of Police and Superintendents of Police to take immediate action to close down cracker shops in the state. The government advised people to refrain from bursting firecrackers through the GO. Failure to do so will invite strict action. An advocate Indira Prakash Puligilla had filed a PIL in the Telangana High Court seeking a ban on bursting of crackers as this would adversely harm those suffering from CVID-19. He had argued that the condition of people already infected by the virus would deteriorate and may even result in death due to increase in the level of air pollution from the smoke.  The Bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Chauhan and Justice Vijaya Sen had passed an order saying, “Presently, the nation and the state are struggling with COVID-19 pandemic. Much as the festivals may be important and may serve a social purpose, people’s lives are most important. It is the bounden duty of the state to ensure that the lives of the people are protected…The court directs the state to immediately impose a ban on the sale and use of fireworks”.  Following the ban, the Telangana Fireworks Dealers Association has moved the Supreme Court, challenging the High Court’s decision. Also the state BJP president and MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar on Friday alleged the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government has failed to protect the sentiments of Hindus vis-a-vis ban on firecrackers. The high court has directed imposition of the ban on firecrackers as the state the government could not effectively argue the matter in the court, he claimed in a statement on Friday. “It has become fashionable to make the festivals of Hindus controversial every time,” Kumar said. He demanded that the government come to the rescue of small businessmen engaged in the sale of firecrackers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-bans-the-sale-and-bursting-of-crackers-170190

13-11-2020||Ayodhya||Ayodhya celebrates Ram’s homecoming, lights 5.84 lakh ‘diyas’ to break world record||The Uttar Pradesh government on Friday went all out in marking the homecoming of Lord Ram to this holy town – the mythical event in ‘treta yug’ on which the festival of Diwali is based. Along the way, the organisers broke a world record.As dusk fell, volunteers lit up nearly six lakh ‘diyas’ lined up on the Saryu riverbank.“Representatives of the Guinness Book of World Records witnessed this grand festival. With 5,84,372 earthen lamps, the event made the world record,” a state government statement said.The “Deepotsav” included the re-enactment of the arrival of God Ram and Goddess Sita to Ayodhya on their ‘pushpak viman’, a laser and sound show, cultural programmes and the lighting of a “record” 5.51 lakh earthen lamps on the banks of the Saryu.Actors representing the deities of Ram, Sita and Lakshman descended in a helicopter that sprinkled rose petals – a modern take on the ‘pushpak viman’ that brought Lord Ram back home after 14 years in exile.The deities were received by Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.This was the fourth annual Ayodhya Deepotsav, and the first since the ‘bhoomi pujan’ in August for a Ram temple in the city. Its construction has begun following last year’s Supreme Court verdict that settled the temple-mosque land dispute.The CM and the Governor visited the Ram Mandir site along with other UP and some bureaucrats.Adityanath gave Prime Minister Narendra Modi the credit for the just-begun construction of the Ram Mandir.“Our generation is not only fortunate to see the start of construction of a Ram temple here but we also attended the historic event,” he said, adding that generations of seers died without the dream being realised.“I thank PM Modi, who is the one who implemented the ideology of Ram Rajya,” Adityanath said in his speech to about 1,000 guests at the Ram Katha Park.With COVID-19 protocols in place, the event was not open to the public.He said when people in Ayodhya used to ask him about the construction of the temple, he would just tell them to trust Modi.He said it is Modi’s dream to develop Ayodhya as the “Vedic Ramayana city”.The celebrations began in the afternoon with a “coronation procession” for Lord Ram starting from Saket College for the riverbank five kilometres away. Eleven tableaux, built around themes from the Ramayana, participated.In the evening, 11,000 earthen lamps lit up the Ram temple site. On the banks of the Saryu bank, the chief minister performed an ‘aarti’.He then lit a ‘diya’ at Ram ki Paidi, which was immediately followed by volunteers lighting up earthen lamps laid out on the riverbank.Officials said there were about 1,000 volunteers to do the job, and aiming to create a new Guinness World Record by lighting at least 5.51 lakh ‘diyas’.The final count was about 33,000 more than this, the government said later.Last year, they lit a record 4,10,000 ‘diyas’, the then new record. Adityanath on Friday said the target next year should be 7.51 lakh.Eight teams of folk dancers were invited to perform at the Deepotsav.“We did rehearsals for over two weeks before coming to Ayodhya,” said Vishal, a member of a troupe from Jhansi.Anuradha, a folk dancer from Mathura, said, “We are very excited that we are performing on the streets of Ayodhya, the city of Lord Ram.”             Before the event, state government officials had listed out development projects for Ayodhya – some of them new, but many already in the pipeline.These include an international airport and widening of roads to other cities.The authorities plan to expand the Ram Katha Park, build a Ramlila Centre and carry out beautification of Ram ki Paidi.Also planned are a modern bus stand, a sewage treatment plant and a multi-level parking lot.

13-11-2020||Beijing||China halts imports of seafood products from Indian firm: Report||China has suspended the import of seafood products from an Indian company for a week starting from Friday, after traces of COVID-19 were reportedly found on the outer packaging of some samples of frozen cuttlefish exported by the firm.China’s General Administration of Customs suspended the import of seafood products from an Indian company for one week starting from Friday after COVID-19 was found on the outer packaging of some samples of frozen cuttlefish from the company, the state-run Global Times reported.The report, however, has not provided any details of the company which exported the fish to China.It also said Liangshan county in East China’s Shandong Province on Friday reported that packaging from one batch of imported frozen beef tested positive for COVID-19.       The beef was delivered from another Chinese city.Control and management of resources will be strengthened, Bi Kexin, head of the import and export food safety bureau of the General Administration of Customs, was quoted as saying.The Chinese customs will further enhance their inspection of cold-chain imported foods in a bid to prevent the risk of imported coronavirus infections, Bi said.China has communicated with the authorities of 109 countries that export cold-chain food products to the country, with suggestions and requirements receiving active responses from the respective departments, Bi said, adding that 140 cold-chain food producers from 50 countries have been inspected, and 22 companies have been dealt with regarding unqualified products.It has been estimated that there have been over 25 novel coronavirus cases detected in imported food cold chains since the first case was found in July, mostly from major frozen food-exporting countries including Ecuador, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil and Norway, the report said.The novel coronavirus, which originated from the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year, has claimed nearly 1.3 million lives and infected over 52 million people globally, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

13-11-2020||Beijing||China denies restricting Indian ship carrying Australian coal from leaving its port||China on Friday denied having restricted an Indian ship carrying Australian coal from leaving its port following complaints of inordinate delay in permitting the vessel from unloading cargo leaving its 23-member crew stranded.The ship, ‘Jag Anand’, carrying a huge consignment of Australian coal to China has been stuck at Jingtang port since June, with the crew members seeking immediate relief as the vessel remained in the queue since its arrival.Their plight has been highlighted by the National Union of Seafarers of India, International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) and the International Maritime Organisation, according to a statement by ITF-Asia Pacific Region.Asked about the ship and its stranded crew, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing here on Friday that “as far as I understand, this Indian shipping vessel has been berthed near Jingtang port since June”.“China has never restricted it from leaving. The freight forwarder does not want to adjust the plans for the vessel due to commercial interests which is the real cause of the situation,” he said.“The local Chinese authorities have been in close contact with the Indian side and responded to their requests timely,” he said, adding that officials offered to provide rescue assistance if there is any medical emergency.“When it is indeed in need of urgent rescue or assistance as long as we receive such requests, China will at the earliest time possible carry out rescue or assistance activities while complying with epidemic prevention and control regulations including providing necessary material supplies,” he said.Earlier, officials of the Indian Embassy here said that since September, the plight of the Indian crew has been taken up with the provincial government of Hebei province where the port is located.They said the Hebei government in its response has said the ship is in the queue for berthing and crew change cannot be allowed due to strict protocols related to the COVID-19 pandemic.It offered to provide any medical assistance to the crew in case of any emergency and stated that the vessel can leave if it wishes to, they said, adding that the response of the Hebei government has been conveyed to the shipping company. Relations between Australia and China in the past few months nose-dived after Canberra barred Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies from its national 5G network over national security concerns.China also resented Canberra’s push for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus in April.Reports from Australia say China has been restricting a number of Australian exports, including coal.Apart from this, China appears to have been irked by a law passed by Australia in 2018 that banned covert foreign interference in domestic politics and made industrial espionage for a foreign power a crime.The laws offended the nation’s most important trading partner, China. Recently, the Chinese Communist Party-controlled Global Times reported that China had asked traders to stop buying at least seven categories of Australian products: coal, barley, copper ore and concentrate, sugar, timber, wine and lobsters.

The Cabinet’s recommendations will be forwarded to the governor whose nod will be followed by other steps leading to the formation of a new government,” Kumar added.At the Cabinet meeting, which lasted barely 10 minutes, the chief minister thanked all his Cabinet colleagues for their cooperation, said Rana Randhir, a BJP leader who held the cooperatives portfolio in the dissolved Cabinet and has returned as the MLA from Madhuban.Despite the BJP emerging as the largest party in the ruling alliance with 74 seats, 31 more than the JD(U), the top leadership of the saffron party, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has emphatically endorsed Kumar as the next chief minister.He was declared the ruling coalition’s chief ministerial candidate much before the election process had started.Informed sources also said issues discussed at the informal meeting of NDA leaders included the representation of each constituent in the new Cabinet and election of the assembly Speaker.Speculation is rife that the BJP might push for an EBC or a Dalit as a Deputy CM though it was not clear whether the insistence was on replacing veteran leader Sushil Kumar Modi, who has been holding the post for the most part since 2005, or replicating the experiment in adjoining Uttar Pradesh where two leaders share the post.One of the names doing the rounds for the Deputy CM’s post is that of Kameshwar Chaupal, a Dalit with deep roots in the Sangh who was famously chosen for laying the foundation stone at the Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya in the 1990s.Supporters of Chaupal, a member of the legislative council, lent credence to speculations as they were noticed chanting slogans to the effect on the streets of the city.Meanwhile, the NDA which has three more MLAs than the magic figure of 122, received a shot in the arm when Independent legislator from Chakai Sumit Singh met the chief minister and extended support.Singh is the son of Narendra Singh, a former state minister and powerful Rajput leader from Jamui district.

A full-time Secretary was needed,” Somaprasad said and added that the State Secretariat acceded to his request to relieve him.Kerala is governed by CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF). The ruling dispensation has its back to the wall with strident Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) and aggressive BJP mounting pressure on it on several fronts, including gold smuggling case, and Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) investigation of Balakrishnan’s son.Balakrishnan, considered to be wielding clout in the party, has stepped down ahead of local elections in the state, scheduled in December, and subsequent Assembly election, which is due about May next year.This is in the backdrop of procrastinated debate within the party since his son, Bineesh Kodiyeri, came into the ED’s investigative net for alleged money laundering.Bineesh was also investigated for the alleged involvement in a narcotics trade, regarding which he has been taken into custody.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cpim-kerala-state-secretary-steps-down-170177

"In the past, a leader has been called "psychopath" and "master divider" by people and agencies. We didn't acknowledge such comments!" he added.May I humbly remind certain overzealous friends of the Media running a sponsored agenda that we don’t comment on individual’s views in a book.In the past, a Leader has been called ”psychopath” and “master divider” by people and agencies.

And second, was when Obama visited India in 2017 said sources.Former US president Barack Obama's new book 'A Promised Land' lands a sharp left hook on Rahul Gandhi's "nervous, uninformed quality" while directing warm, not-so-political praise at Rahul's mother Sonia Gandhi, according to a book review Thursday in the New York Times.The first rush of book excerpts swirling on the internet point to a brutal takedown of Rahul Gandhi. "Rahul Gandhi has a nervous, unformed quality about him, as if he were a student who'd done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject," notes the review.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-refuses-to-comment-on-obama-statement-party-leaders-target-former-us-president-170176

13-11-2020||New Delhi||'No lawyers, no apology': Comedian Kunal Kamra reacts  to 'contempt proceedings' against him||Stand-up comic artist Kunal Kamra on Friday refused to retract his controversial tweets against the Supreme Court or apologise for them, saying he believes they “speak for themselves”.Kamra's statement comes a day after Attorney General K K Venugopal consented to the initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against him for a series of tweets following the apex court giving interim bail to Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami.“The tweets I recently put out have been found in contempt of court. All that I tweeted was from my view of the Supreme Court of India giving a partial decision in favour of a Prime Time Loudspeaker,” he said in a statement addressed to Venugopal and the judges on his Twitter page.“My view hasn't changed because the silence of the Supreme Court of India on matters of other's personal liberty cannot go uncriticized. I don't intend to retract my tweets or apologise for them. I believe they speak for themselves,” he added.Kamra, who was banned by several airlines after he heckled Goswami on an IndiGo flight earlier this year, said he enjoys a platform with a captive audience but a time slot before the Supreme Court is a scarce commodity and should go to more pressing issues in front of the nation.He also referred to contempt proceedings against lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who had refused to apologise for his derogatory tweets and was held guilty of contempt earlier this year.“I wish to volunteer having the time that would be allotted to the hearing of my contempt petition (20 hours at the very least, if Prashant Bhushan's hearing is anything to go by), to other matters and parties who have not been as lucky and privileged as I am to jump the queue,” Kamra said. The stand-up comedian and satirist then went on to list the important petitions pending in front of the court, listing the pleas on demonetisation, the challenge to the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status, the matter of the legality of electoral bonds and “countless other matters that are more deserving of time and attention”.“The Supreme Court of India hasn't yet declared my tweets anything as of now but if and when they do I hope they can have a small laugh before declaring them Contempt of Court,” he said.The apex court on Wednesday granted interim bail to Goswami in an abetment to suicide case, saying it will be a "travesty of justice" if personal liberty is curtailed.No lawyers, No apology, No fine, No waste of space 🙏🙏🙏 pic.twitter.com/B1U7dkVB1W  Terming Kamra's tweets in “bad taste”, Venugopal on Thursday said it was time for people to understand that attacking the apex court brazenly will attract punishment.“I have gone through each one of the tweets which you have annexed for consent to proceed by way of criminal contempt against Kunal Kamra. The tweets which I am extracting below are not only in bad taste but clearly cross the line between humour and contempt of the court,” the top law officer said in a letter to one of the applicants who had sought his consent to initiate contempt proceedings against Kamra.“I therefore grant consent to proceed by way of initiating contempt proceedings against Kunal Kamra,” Venugopal said.The consent of either the attorney general or the solicitor general is necessary, under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, for initiating contempt proceedings against a person.In one of the letters seeking the attorney general's consent, three lawyers claimed that Kamra had allegedly attempted to “lower the authority of the Supreme Court of India” through his tweets after the apex court granted Goswami bail. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-lawyers-no-apology-comedian-kunal-kamra-reacts-to-contempt-proceedings-against-him-170157
13-11-2020||Karachi||Pak bans online payments for Indian electronic media content: Report||Pakistan government has asked Pakistani banks to immediately ban online payments from this country for the subscription of electronic media content from India, according to a media report on Friday.The decision was taken by the Cabinet on November 9, Dawn newspaper reported, adding that the banking authorities have also been asked to submit a compliance report to the State Bank of Pakistan, the central bank of the country, by November 13.“We are in receipt of a letter from the cabinet division, Government of Pakistan, whereby they have instructed us to stop different modes of payments, including credit cards, for subscribing (to) Indian Content in Pakistan, including Zee5 video-on-demand service,” according to the circular.“It is advised to ensure meticulous compliance of aforementioned instructions of the Government of Pakistan and submit compliance status to the State Bank of Pakistan by November 13, 2020,” the circular added.When contacted, former chairman of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) Absar Alam said that Indian content has already been banned in Pakistan, so the new circular could hit online payments for Direct to Home (DTH) service.He said those who have DTH facilities are mostly using Indian content and they make online payments.Now the subscriber cannot pay directly from Pakistan, but the Indian provider can get payments from other countries like the United Arab Emirates.In India, DTH broadcasting service refers to the distribution of multichannel TV programmes by using a satellite system and providing TV signals directly to subscribers’ premises.No data is available about how many Pakistanis are using this option to subscribe to Indian content.Bankers said they only have to ensure that no payment is made from Pakistan for Indian content.In response to a question, an official of one of the biggest local channels said it subscribed to only some content from India and all the payments are made through Dubai, so no online payment from Pakistan was required.Sources in the entertainment circles said they were sure that the online payment mode ban was imposed following a drama serial that is broadcast by an Indian channel, the report said.The show ran into controversy when PEMRA banned it in Pakistan after a backlash over a clip that went viral on social media, the report said.Following the Pakistani Cabinet’s decision, the country’s entertainment industry and audiences reacted with disappointment to the decision.Many people belonging to the entertainment industry expressed their frustration at the decision and many noted it will affect the livelihood of actors, writers, directors and technicians across the country.In recent times many actors, writers, directors and technicians have been turning to digital/OTT given the lack of local streaming options.On demand and paid streamlining services operating out of India including Zee5 gained a lot of popularity and subscribers base in the last few months due to the COVID-19 pandemic which left people working from home and in lockdowns.Zee5 in particular has been airing Pakistani made content on its streaming service available in Pakistan with two major serials, Churails and Ek Jhooti Love Story.

13-11-2020||New Delhi||WHO to set up centre for traditional medicine in India||The World Health Organisation announced on Friday that it will set up a Global Centre for Traditional Medicine in India, with Prime Minister Narendra expressing confidence that just like the country has emerged as the ‘pharmacy of the world’, the WHO institution will become the centre for global wellness.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the announcement in a video message at an event in which Prime Minister Modi dedicated two future-ready Ayurveda institutions in Jaipur and Jamnagar to the nation via video conferencing on the occasion of the 5th Ayurveda Day.The Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda (ITRA), Jamnagar (Gujarat) and the National Institute of Ayurveda (NIA), Jaipur (Rajasthan) are both premier institutions of Ayurveda in the country.The Jamnagar institute has been conferred the status of an Institution of National Importance (INI) by an act of Parliament and the one at Jaipur has been designated an Institution Deemed to be University (De novo Category) by the University Grants Commission (UGC), according to the AYUSH ministry.In his video message, Ghebreyesus said, “I am pleased to announce that we have agreed to open a WHO Global Centre of Traditional Medicine in India to strengthen the evidence, research, training and awareness of traditional and complementary medicine.”        “This new centre will support WHO’s efforts to implement the WHO traditional medicine strategy 2014-2023 which aims to support countries in developing policies and action plans to strengthen the role of traditional medicine as part of their journey to universal health coverage and a healthier, fairer and safer world,” he said.Traditional systems of medicine such as Ayurveda can play an important role in integrated people-centric health services and healthcare, but they have not received enough attention, the WHO DG said.Ghebreyesus also lauded Prime Minister Modi for his commitment to the universal coverage under Ayushman Bharat and evidence-based promotion of traditional medicines to achieve health related objectives.Modi said Ayurveda is India’s heritage whose expansion entails the welfare of humanity and all Indians will be happy to see that the country’s traditional knowledge is enriching other countries.“It is a matter of pride for all Indians that the WHO has chosen India for establishing its Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. Now work will be done in this direction from India,” Modi said.“I would like to thank the WHO and particularly its Director General Tedros for giving this responsibility to India. I am confident that just like India has emerged as the pharmacy of the world, in the same manner this centre for traditional medicine will become the centre for global wellness,” he said.Stressing on bringing ayurveda knowledge out of books, scriptures and home remedies and developing this ancient knowledge as per modern needs, Modi said new research is being done in the country by combining information received from modern science of the 21st century with India’s ancient medical knowledge.Noting that three years ago, the All India Ayurvedic Institute was established here, he said Ayurveda is not just an alternative today but one of the key basis of the country’s health policy.Modi informed that work is on to develop the National Sowa-Rigpa Institute for research and other studies related to Sowa-Rigpa in Leh. The two institutions in Gujarat and Rajasthan which have been upgraded are also an extension of this development, he added.Congratulating the two institutes for their upgradation, the prime minister pointed out that they have more responsibility now and hoped that they will prepare syllabus for Ayurveda which meets international standards.He also called upon the Education Ministry and UGC to find new avenues in disciplines like Ayurveda Physics and Ayurveda Chemistry.Modi also urged startups and the private sector to study global trends and demands and ensure their participation in the sector.Pointing out that during the coronavirus period the demand for Ayurvedic products increased rapidly all over the world, he said exports of Ayurvedic products increased by about 45 per cent in September this year compared to the previous year.He said the significant increase in export of spices like turmeric, ginger, considered as immunity boosters, shows the sudden boost in confidence in Ayurvedic solutions and Indian spices in the world.In many countries, drinks related to turmeric are also increasing and the world’s prestigious medical journals are also seeing new hope in Ayurveda, he noted.Modi said that during the coronavirus period, the focus was not only limited to the use of Ayurveda alone but also on research related to AYUSH in the country and the world.“On one hand, India is testing vaccines, on the other, it is also increasing international cooperation on Ayurvedic research to fight COVID,” he said.Modi pointed out that research is going on in more than a hundred places including at the All India Institute of Ayurveda in Delhi which has conducted research related to immunity on 80,000 Delhi Police personnel.It may be the world’s largest group study and there are encouraging results, he said.A few more international trials are to be started, he added.He also highlighted that prices of Ayurvedic herbs like Ashwagandha, Giloy, Tulsi have increased amid the pandemic.The price of Ashwagandha has more than doubled compared to last year and its direct benefit is reaching farmers, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-to-set-up-centre-for-traditional-medicine-in-india-170143

The BJP has been successful to a large extent in polarising the voters in the state on communal lines.In a state where the BJP was a non-entity till about four years ago, won 18 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 Parliamentary election, giving dominant TMC run for its money. It emerged as the principal challenger to TMC, relegating both the LF and Congress to the margins in the process.In the last two assembly elections, the TMC received support from the community which helped it to attain power in the state.The apparent consternation in the non-BJP spectrum is with a firm view that any possible garboil in the Muslim community in the state, or split in their votes due to AIMIM’s entry, could boost the prospects of a resurgent BJP, especially in the wake of its buoyancy after Bihar election results.According to popular estimate, the AIMIM was instrumental in the defeat of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) of Sharad Pawar at a good number of seats in Maharashtra in the last assembly election in the state.“Owaisi is a prop of the BJP and the people of Bengal have understood his politics. The AIMIM has the capacity to undercut votes of TMC, Left and the Congress,” a national Left leader said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/non-bjp-parties-in-west-bengal-on-edge-over-upcoming-high-stake-assembly-election-170138

Our assistance does not create indebtedness and is without conditionalities,” India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti said at the 44th Annual Meeting of the G-77 Foreign Ministers on Thursday.Tirumurti said the pandemic threatens to setback decades of progress made by developing countries and push millions back into poverty. “As G-77 countries, we cannot let this happen. We need to raise our collective voice for recovery, resilience and reform to ensure that we go back to the path of development,” he said at the forum titled ‘Global response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the obstacles it poses to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and achievement of the SDGs'.Tirumurti reiterated India's steadfast commitment to work with its partners from the global South in the G-77 “towards a resilient and sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and to build back better and stronger.” Giving the statement for External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Tirumurti emphasised that India's approach will be human-centric, based on principles of mutual respect and national ownership with a commitment to sustainable development for all, in the spirit of ‘World Is One Family'.Underscoring the need for affordable health systems and resilient supply chains to fight the pandemic, he said India is assisting in urgent health and medical supplies to more than 150 countries. India has pledged 15 million dollars for GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and operationalised the COVID-19 Emergency Fund for India's neighbours with an initial contribution of 10 million dollars. Prime Minister Modi has pledged that India, as the largest vaccine producing country, will make its production and delivery capacity available to the entire humanity, Tirumurti said.He further noted that as the 75th anniversary of the United Nations is commemorated this year, the pandemic has laid bare the “shortcomings” of the world organisation and other multilateral institutions. “The call for reformed multilateralism, including reform of UN Security Council, has only become stronger than ever before,” he said.Tirumurti told the annual ministerial meeting of the 'Group of 77' that in its South-South cooperation, New Delhi has never let geography limit its approach to assist the developing world. The India-CARICOM Leaders Meeting, India-Pacific Islands Summit, India-ASEAN Summits and India-Africa Forum Summits have further strengthened the special bonding between India and fellow developing countries, he said, adding that India's own embrace of the digital revolution will be a model for the developing world in the global response to COVID.India's concessional Lines of Credit of over 30 billion dollars, its grants-in-aid projects and flagship training and capacity building project under Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) have made a huge contribution to fellow developing countries. Further, the 150 million dollar India-UN Development Partnership Fund continues to support transformational sustainable development projects with a focus on LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS.Tirumurti underlined that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement and Financing for Development framework should lay the foundations for global efforts. “We need to impress on our developed country partners to do more and show the necessary urgency. COVID pandemic cannot be used as an excuse to not fulfil their commitments or to undermine environmental Conventions.  India called on developed country partners to undertake activities to strengthen ‘Convention-Plus' actions and not do ‘Convention-Minus'. He said ‘Convention-Plus' examples include the International Solar Alliance spearheaded by Modi where India has pledged 1.7 billion dollars for solar energy projects and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.

Closure directions were issued to 15 of them for operating without ETPs, the DPCC said.A show-cause notice was issued to an automobile service and repair unit in Patparganj industrial area after ETP overflow was observed.Visuals of toxic froth floating on the surface of the Yamuna river near Kalindi Kunj in Delhi made their way back to social media over the past few days, with experts citing detergents as one of the major reasons behind the pollution.“Majority of the detergents in the country don’t have a certification by International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), which has capped the concentration of phosphates in the chemical substance,” an official of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said.The primary reason behind the formation of the toxic foam was high phosphate content in the wastewater because of detergents used in dyeing industries, dhobi ghats and households, according to the official.“A large number of unbranded detergents are also used in households and dyeing industries. The wastewater containing high phosphate content reaches the river through untapped drains,” he said.

Despite its acknowledgement, Pakistan is yet to show sincerity in delivering justice. - Anurag Srivastava, MEA“While the list includes a few members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), including the crew members of boats used to execute the 26/11 attacks, it glaringly omits the mastermind and key conspirators,” noted MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava at a media briefing on Thursday.The list makes it clear that Pakistan has the necessary information and proof on the conspirators and facilitators of the Mumbai attack based in Pakistan, he said.At least 11 LeT members are on the list for their role in the 2008 attacks, but not the masterminds. The FIA list included MQM’s Altaf Hussain, Muhammad Anwar, Iftikhar Hussain and several Al Qaeda, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, Sipah-e-Muhammad Pakistan, LeT and JeM members.It has claimed that most of the terrorists are overseas, including Iran, Syria, Afghanistan and the UK. The list also includes N-League member Nasir Mahmood, who recorded a video confession of former accountability court judge Arshad Malik.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-masterminds-not-on-pakistan-list-of-most-wanted-170020

It is their decision, what they said, why they said. The ultimate decision lies with the people. - Sunil Arora, CECNDA Won by deceitHad the votes been counted fairly, we would have won 130 seats… Will Nitish heed his conscience & abdicate his chair. Tejashwi YadavOath date likely todayThe date for swearing-in will be discussed by NDA allies on Friday... The BJP has to decide on (including) LJP.  - Nitish KumarRJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, after being unanimously elected leader of the Mahagathbandhan in the state Assembly today, led the charge against the NDA saying the ruling alliance “won by fraud”. He said he would petition the Election Commission for a recount in booths where postal ballots were “invalidated”.Tejashwi cited JDU’s relegation to the third slot among Bihar parties and dared Nitish Kumar “to step aside giving up his attachment for the chair”. “Will Nitish Kumar heed his conscience and abdicate his chair,” asked Tejashwi, recalling 2017 when Nitish Kumar had resigned as grand alliance CM citing his “conscience” after accusations of money laundering surfaced against Tejashwi.The Congress also said the Bihar mandate was against Nitish Kumar. “We accept the verdict. We are disappointed and I am sure the Congress Working Committee will review the party’s performance in Bihar and come out with a statement,” Congress leader P Chidambaram said.Chidambaram mentioned the meagre 0.03 per cent vote share difference between the NDA and grand alliance in Bihar to argue, “This meagre vote share difference translated into 125 seats for the NDA and 110 for the grand alliance. A few seats would have changed the outcome.” Tejashwi wondered how a vote difference of barely 12,270 votes translated into 125 seats. Yadav flagged “discrepancies” like postal ballots being counted last in some booths and several postal ballots being declared invalid at some others.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rjd-nitish-lacks-mandate-to-be-cm-170039

13-11-2020||---||Amid controversy, PM unveils Vivekananda statue at JNU||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 12Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the ideology of a person should be in sync with the interest of the country and not against it. “Putting ideology before nationalism has done a lot of harm to the country,” he said, unveiling a life-size statue of Swami Vivekananda at the campus of the Left-dominated JNU amid protests by students’ union.Saffron takeover?The statue has been a cause of contention for a while amid allegations of a “saffron takeover” of the campus.The Prime Minister, in his first address at the university which has been home to several ideological controversies and clashes, told students that using one’s own ideology into matters related to the country was not right. “On subjects of national interest, our ideology should be with the country and not against it. People of different ideologies came together during our freedom struggle to fight as one. I was part of the movement against the Emergency. Several former leaders of the Congress, RSS volunteers, and socialist and communist leaders came together back then, but no one had to compromise on ideology. There was only one purpose — national interest. Therefore, whenever there is a question of national unity, integrity and national interest, taking decisions under the influence of any ideology will lead to loss for the nation,” he said.While students questioned the source of funding of the statue, pointing to lack of infrastructure and funds for academic works and research, BJP leaders said it was “not about funds but ideology”. “They are okay with the statue of Nehru but have a problem with the statue of Swami Vivekananda,” said BJP leaders. Meanwhile, Vice Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar said the statue had been installed with the support of the alumni.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-controversy-pm-unveils-vivekananda-statue-at-jnu-170046
