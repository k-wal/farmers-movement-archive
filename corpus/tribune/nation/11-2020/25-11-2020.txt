A provision of five-year jail term is there in the draft bill for the priests or religious gurus, who solemnise such marriages without seeking the district magistrate’s nod,” Mishra said on Wednesday.Mishra held a meeting with officials on Wednesday to discuss the draft of the bill.“Under this proposed law, the parties concerned will have to submit an application to the district magistrate before the conversion for marriage,” the minister said.“It will be mandatory for the person converting to another religion for marriage, and the religious persons involved to obtain permission of the district magistrate concerned a month in advance,” he said.“Any offence under this new proposed law would be cognizable and non-bailable. Those who help in solemnising marriages would also be treated as the main accused,” he said.Those accused of marriage by conversion will themselves have to prove that this work has been done without any pressure, threat or allurement, he said.

25-11-2020||New Delhi||CBI recovers Rs 1 crore during searches over corruption charges against govt officials||The CBI on Wednesday recovered Rs 1.07 crore in cash during searches in connection with two separate cases of corruption against government employees, officials said.The searches were related to a disproportionate assets case against Chief Electrical Distribution Engineer Ravish Kumar, posted at East Central Railways, Hajipur; and another case against India Tourism Assistant Director S Ramakrishnan in Chennai for allegedly taking bribe from hotel owners, the agency said.After filing the cases, the CBI on Wednesday carried out searches at 15 locations spread across Patna, Chennai, Kochi, Ernakulam and Kollam.During the searches conducted in Bihar in connection with the case against Kumar, the CBI recovered Rs 76 lakh in cash, besides jewellery and documents related to 15 properties.The searches in Tamil Nadu and Kerala in connection with the case against Ramakrishnan resulted in the recovery of Rs 31 lakh in cash and incriminating documents, they said.The CBI has alleged that Kumar amassed illicit wealth between January 2009 and October, 2020 while posted in the Railways.“It was further alleged in FIR that during the said period, the accused received a total income of Rs 1.04 crore (approx) from his salary and others and Rs 40 lakh (approx) income of his wife.“During the said period, his total expenses were allegedly Rs 67.41 lakh (approx). Thus, his likely saving during check period was allegedly Rs 76.59 lakh,” CBI Spokesperson RK Gaur said.He said the accused engineer allegedly acquired and possessed movable and immovable assets at various places in his name and in the name of his family members of approximate value of over Rs 3.40 crore.“It was further alleged that during check period disproportionate assets have been computed at Rs 2.64 crore, which is approx 183.40 per cent of the net income, which is disproportionate to his known sources of the income,” he said.The case against Assistant Director India Tourism Ramakrishnan pertains to allegations of receiving bribes from hotel owners during periodical inspection in various hotels for the purpose of issuing classification and license.“It was further alleged that the accused would be proceeding to Palani near Madurai with the bribe amount of Rs 7 lakh (approx.) collected from various hoteliers for giving favourable report.

25-11-2020||---||GCM accepts plea of jurisdiction of 2 officers accused of financial irregularities; no further trial||Chandigarh, November 25A summary general court martial (SGCM) trying two army officers for alleged financial misappropriation of over Rs 58 lakh on Wednesday accepted their  special plea to jurisdiction over non-compliance of certain procedures during the disciplinary proceedings and consequently they will not have to undergo the trial.During the SGCM proceedings being held at Akhnoor, the defence Brig Janesh Khera (retd) had contended that mandatory provisions under Army Rule 22 and Army Rule 180 were not adhered to during the court of inquiry and hearing of charge. He said the accused were not allowed to cross examine certain key witnesses during the stage of hearing of charge.This was established when their commanding officer, who had held the hearing of charge, was examined during the court martial.One of the accused officers, a Colonel, was the commanding officer of an Electronics and Mechanical Engineers’ (EME) battalion in the northern sector, while the other, a Lieutenant Colonel, was commanding one of the battalion’s field workshop. A joint trial, presided by Brig RD Sharma, Commander of an Armoured Brigade, has been convened to try them on three charges. During the change of command, certain irregularities in the battalion were observed and the matter was reported to higher authorities, following which a court of inquiry (COI) was ordered in 2017 to investigate the lapses. Both officers were posted out within a few days of each other, sources said. They were later attached back, along with the unit’s Subedar Major, for disciplinary action.An EME battalion receives technical grants for maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment, including IT hardware and paraphernalia. During the COI, it was brought out that bookings for equipment and work amounting to about Rs 40 lakh had been made by the Colonel against this grant while similar books amounting to Rs 17 lakh had been made by the Lieutenant Colonel. The equipment was not received in the battalion.In addition, the Lieutenant Colonel has also been charged with siphoning Rs 1.86 lakh from the condiment allowance meant for troops, while the Colonel has been charged for failure of command and control for inability on his part to detect and prevent this.Further, the officers were also allegedly involved in surreptitiously felling about 200 trees in unit area and selling them. They are being tried under Sections 52(b) and Sector 63 of the Army Act for intent to defraud and acts prejudicial to good order and military discipline.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gcm-accepts-plea-of-jurisdiction-of-2-officers-accused-of-financial-irregularities-no-further-trial-175756
25-11-2020||New Delhi||Bank operations may be hit by unions' strike on Thursday||Banking operations across the country may be impacted on Thursday as some bank unions would be joining the one-day nationwide strike called by central trade unions.Ten central trade unions, except Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, will observe the nationwide general strike to protest against various policies of the Central government.Many lenders, including IDBI Bank and Bank of Maharashtra, in regulatory filings on Wednesday said their normal working could be affected at the branches and offices.The All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA), All India Bank Officers Association (AIBOA) and Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) are participating in the strike."Lok Sabha in its recently held session has passed three new labour enactments by dismantling existing 27 enactments in the name of 'Ease of Business', which are purely in the interest of corporates. "In the process, 75 per cent of workers are being pushed out of the orbits of labour laws since they will have no legal protection under the new enactment," the AIBEA said in a release.The association represents the majority of the banks, except State Bank of India (SBI) and Indian Overseas Bank.It has four lakh bank employees from various public and old private sectors and a few foreign banks as its members."If strike materialises, the normal functioning of the bank branches and offices is likely to be affected. The bank is taking all necessary steps to minimise the impact of strike so as to provide the normal banking services to its customers," the Bank of Maharashtra said in a filing.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bank-operations-may-be-hit-by-unions-strike-on-thursday-175752

25-11-2020||Vibha Sharma||Tracking 'Nivar' and ways climate change has heightened its threat||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 25The actual impact or damage caused by Nivar will be known Thursday morning, but its transition to the ‘very severe cyclone’ cyclone is yet another indication of the various ways climate change and global warming is intensifying natural events, especially tropical storms.  There has been a global increase in the intensity of the strongest storms over recent decades. Nivar intensified from a ‘severe’ category storm to a ‘very severe’ category within 24 hours, which scientists attribute to large-scale and local environmental conditions, including manmade contributions.There is also a correlation between cooler phase of ENSO, known as La Niña, and increased tropical cyclone activity in the Bay of Bengal. This being a La Niña year (which is also responsible for harsher and longer winters) is another underlying cause behind Nivar.According to Dr Roxy Mathew Koll from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, La Niña makes local environmental conditions favorable for cyclogenesis in the Bay of Bengal. “During the past 40 years, six cyclones of the severe cyclone category hit the Tamil Nadu coast in November, out of which five coincided with La Niña like conditions in the Pacific. So that means to some extent we were expecting a cyclone season in the Bay of Bengal during this time and it is not a surprise.”“The Bay of Bengal is part of the warm pool region, where the temperatures are generally about 28-29°C in November and occasionally exceeding 30°C. These high temperatures are generally conducive for cyclogenesis. This time the temperature anomalies are about 0.5-1°C and in some regions reaching 1.2°C, based on buoy and satellite estimates. Every 0.1°C means additional energy for the cyclone to maintain and develop. Locally, the winds are also favoring cyclone formation,” adds Koll.Studies have found that the proportion of strongest storms is increasing about 8% a decade. They also suggest how “ocean surface and subsurface conditions played a vital role in the genesis and intensification of cyclone Ockhi”, a very similar cyclone that hit the same region almost exactly three years ago.Similar to other parts of the world, sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal have been steadily increasing over the last decades, a factor driving rapid intensification. Besides a warmer atmosphere can hold more water, driving extreme rainfall during cyclones, increasing threat of flooding, Increases in storm surge related to climate change can be due to rising sea levels, increasing size, and increasing storm wind speeds. Global sea levels have already increased about 23 cm as a result of human carbon emissions, dramatically increasing the distance that storm surges can reach, experts say. Dr Anjal Prakash of the Indian School of Business adds that “since the beginning of 2020, this is 8th such incidence in the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. “Changing climatic conditions are adding more cyclonic events every year and so adaptation to these events is how we can save the lives of millions of people especially the poor and the marginalised.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tracking-nivar-and-ways-climate-change-has-heightened-its-threat-175742

On that day, the Trinamool Congress workers who are now inflicting torture on people will not find any way to escape. If there is no change, then torture by the TMC will reach such heights that people will not be able to stay here," he said.Claiming that the state police will not be allowed to go near the polling booths which will be manned by personnel of central forces, the BJP’s West Bengal chief said that people would be able to cast their own votes this time.Ghosh alleged that funds sent by the Centre did not reach the hands of the people and were looted by Trinamool Congress leaders.

The two drones come from the series known as the ‘predators’ made by US company General Atomics.The lease is direct from the company, official sources said on Wednesday.  The Navy will get the ‘Sea Guardian’ version of the ‘Predator’ series of drones. The US Navy uses the same variant.The drones have arrived at the Indian Naval Station INS Rajali near Chennai and have been leased for a period of one year. The case for getting 30 such drones – in two variants, one for use over land the other for use over sea  -- is being processed separately, said the source. The two drones are under ‘emergency procurement’.The lease has been done after the Defence Acquisition Procedure-2020 incorporated a new category to enable operating of assets without owning them.These drones carry a multi-mode radar for surveillance including a special radar called the Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) mode that allows to track multiple targets. These can be armed with Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) weapons and be launched to examine an area. The drone will relay live images and videos. The drones have an endurance of over 30 hours.India could deploy the same in Ladakh and also over the Indian Ocean.An American crew from the General Atomics is accompanying the equipment and would help the Navy to operate the machines. Under the lease agreement, the American support staff will only help in the maintenance and technical issues. The planning of flights and controls on ground would be with the Indian Navy.

25-11-2020||New Delhi||SC asks Centre to apprise it about status of women Army officers regarding permanent commission||The Supreme Court on Wednesday sought to know from the Centre, the individual status of 615 serving Short Service Commission (SSC) women officers in Indian Army, out of whom 422 have been found fit on merit for the grant of permanent commission.The apex court’s query came after the Centre apprised it that the selection process for grant of permanent commission to women officers in the Army has culminated and results have been declared.A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee fixed the plea filed by several women officers, who were not selected for grant of permanent commission for further hearing in December and sought to know the details of each of the applicants who had applied for grant of permanent commission.At the outset, senior advocate P S Patwalia, appearing for some women candidates, said that one of his client has completed 20 years in service but was not granted permanent commission and if the court fixes another date, she will be relieved from the service.He said that his second client is completing her engineering course but now she has been denied permanent commission and no one has told why she was not granted the permanent commission. He sought an interim order of status quo till the next date of hearing.The bench said that it cannot pass such orders without looking at the counter affidavit or hearing the Centre.Counsel appearing for Centre told the bench that their affidavit is almost ready and within a day’s time it will be filed.Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, appearing for another set of candidates, claimed that as per media reports out of 615 candidates only 277 has been granted permanent commission.                                 She contended that many of the women who have not been selected for permanent commission are decorated officers and the government is not even filing the reply to their petitions.Arora urged the court that let this not be a partial victory for women in Armed forces and sought assurance from Centre that there will be no precipitative action qua the petitioners till the next hearing in the matter.The bench asked counsel appearing for the Centre to seek instruction for ensuring no precipitative action till the next date of hearing.Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, appearing for the Centre, said that their affidavit is ready but a fresh Interlocutory Application has been filed which needs to be taken care of.He said that the government will respond to all 17 petitioners before the court individually. The bench said that one candidate has cleared to complete M. Tech degree course and her case should be looked into independently by the government.         Jain said that out of 615 candidates, 422 have been found to be fit on merits.      The bench said that it would take up the matter for detailed hearing in December and by then the Centre should file a chart and tell the individual status of each of the applicants.On July 7, the top court had granted one more month to the Centre to implement its verdict directing that permanent commission be given to all serving SSC women officers in the Army.The Centre had told the court that decision making on the issue is at a final stage and only formal orders remain to be issued and the court’s verdict will be complied with in letter and spirit.In a landmark verdict on February 17, the top court had directed that women officers in the Army be granted permanent commission and command postings, rejecting the Centre’s stand of their physiological limitations as being based on “sex stereotypes” and “gender discrimination against women”.It had directed the Centre that within three months, all serving SSC women officers have to be considered for Permanent Commission (PC) irrespective of them having crossed 14 years or, as the case may be, 20 years of service.The top court had said that women officers have got numerous commendation certificates and laurels and their track record of service to the nation is beyond reproach.It had rejected the Centre’s submission that women officers cannot be granted permanent commission due to physiological limitations, all-male environment in a unit, combat capability and said that mindset change is required to recognize the values of the Constitution.               The top court had noted that Indian Army has sanctioned 50,266 posts for officers, while the posts currently occupied are 40,825 including 1,653 by women officers.It had noted that there is a shortage of 9,441 officers in the Indian Army.There are a total of 1,653 women officers which is a miniscule 4 per cent of the total strength of commissioned officers in the Army, it had said.The total of 1,653 officers includes -- 77 having above 20 years of service, 255 having service tenure between 14 and 20 years and the fate of 322 women officers was to be decided by the verdict of the apex court.

Tujhe hum 164 ka bayan aur case ke trial mein nahin pahunchne denge (No matter how many bodyguards you keep, you won't be able to escape because we would blow up your house and car with RDX. You won't be able to attend the trial of this case)."The alleged threat was received months after the Delhi High Court had directed the police to continue providing security to Verma, one of the key witnesses in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case involving Tytler.Justice Yogesh Khanna had on September 28 issued a notice to the Delhi Police and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in this matter.On October 5, a separate Bench of the High Court had asked two senior Delhi Police officers to file a reply on a contempt petition filed by Verma, alleging non-compliance of an order to grant security to him.This came after Verma sought contempt action against the Deputy Commissioner and Additional Deputy Commissioner of Delhi Police (south district) for alleged wilful disobedience and for not complying with the directions passed by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate on August 18 to continue providing police security to him as per his previous security arrangements.Verma was earlier provided with three security personnel for his personal security as well as for his family members who too were receiving threats.The case relates to the riots at the Pulbangash gurdwara in North Delhi where three people were killed on November 1, 1984, a day after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.Tytler, who has denied his role in the riots, was thrice given clean chit by the CBI in the case, but the agency was directed by the court to further investigate the matter.The victims had filed a protest petition challenging the CBI's closure reports in the case. The agency had re-investigated the case related to the killing of Badal Singh, Thakur Singh and Gurcharan Singh near the gurdwara after a court in December 2007 refused to accept its closure report.

25-11-2020||New Delhi||Plea in SC seeks direction to EC to stop using EVMs, use ballot paper in polls||A petition was Wednesday filed in the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Election Commission to stop using electronic voting machine (EVM) and use ballot paper in the forthcoming polls in the country.The plea has alleged that EVMs are prone to error and several other countries have banned its use as doubts have been raised on its accuracy.“The electronic voting machines must be replaced across India with traditional ballot papers. Voting through ballot papers is a more reliable and transparent method for the electoral process of any country,” the plea, filed by advocate C R Jaya Sukin, said.The plea alleged that EVMs can be “tampered during its manufacturing” and in such cases, it does not even require any hacker or malware to manipulate the actual voting.“No machine ever made anywhere in the world is infallible,” the plea said.Questions have been raised over EVMs in the past and Election Commission has maintained that EVMs are safe and tamper proof. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-sc-seeks-direction-to-ec-to-stop-using-evms-use-ballot-paper-in-polls-175714
25-11-2020||Hyderabad||Smriti Irani seeks probe into Rohingyas finding way into voter lists||Union Textile Minister Smriti Irani has demanded an inquiry into charges that the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has got Rohingyas enrolled in the voters list.During a day visit to Hyderabad today, she said the matter came to light when some of the Rohingyas thanked the AIMIM for helping them get in the mainstream.“The AIMIM trying to weaken the country from inside by helping illegal immigrants register in voters list depriving social benefits to true citizens of the country. It is the duty of the Telangana government to get the issue thoroughly inquired and action taken against all found guilty,” she said at the BJP office at Nampally today.  Quoting local news channels, she said the reports had pointed out that AIMIM leaders have enrolled the Rohingyas in voters list by providing them recommendation letters on their official letterheads.  “As this is a State subject the TRS government must investigate the reports,” she said, countering the allegation of the Hyderabad MP and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi who has said, “Home Minister Amit Shah should have taken action if illegal immigrants found a way into the voters list”.Calling upon the voters of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) where polls for 150 divisions will take place on December 1 and results announced on December 5, she said, “The convenient and corrupt collaboration of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and its ally AIMIM has deprived the old city of development but they try to benefit from the illegal voters. The alliance has bled the coffers of the city. The alliance between the two parties resulted in 75,000 encroachments that led to the recent deluge.”  The Union minister accused TRS for not implementing some centrally sponsored welfare programmes such as Ayushman Bharat in Telangana.“From the Textile Ministry alone, Telangana was given Rs 1920 crore for textile development in the state and 63,000 young men and women were imparted skill development training out of which 10,000 found employment,” she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/smriti-irani-seeks-probe-into-rohingyas-finding-way-into-voter-lists-175713
25-11-2020||Patna||BJP leader Vijay Kumar Sinha becomes Speaker of Bihar Assembly||The ruling NDA in Bihar on Wednesday emerged victorious in the first trial of strength in the newly constituted assembly where its candidate Vijay Kumar Sinha got elected as the Speaker by a majority vote.Sinha, a senior BJP leader, was declared elected by Pro- Tem Speaker Jitan Ram Manjhi who told the House that the NDA candidate got 126 votes against 114 polled by Awadh Bihari Chaudhary who was fielded by the opposition Grand Alliance.In the 243-member assembly, the lone BSP MLA did not take part in the voting, so is pro-tem Speaker Manjhi and probably one among the opposition coalition allies absented.The only Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) legislator sided with the NDA.Hyderbabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi headed AIMIM’s five MLAs voted against the BJP nominee.The election took place amid rumpus by a petulant opposition which demanded that voting be conducted by secret ballot and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his Cabinet colleagues who were not members of the assembly be asked to leave the House.The demands were turned down by the Chair, evoking vociferous protests by the opposition, which forced adjournment of the House for about five minutes, a development which was frowned upon by the treasury benches which observed that such obstructions during the election of the Speaker were unheard of.Proceedings of the day began with swearing in of four MLAs who could not take oath in the last couple of days. These included Aniruddh Prasad Yadav and Narendra Kumar Neeraj of the JD(U), RJDs Anant Kumar Singh and CPI(ML)s Amarjeet Kushwaha.Yadav, who recently recovered from COVID-19 affliction, attracted much attention as he arrived and took oath wearing his PPE kit.Anant Kumar Singh, a fearsome but colourful personality of Bihar politics, impressed all when he recited the oath statement from memory without casting a glance on the text provided.As Manjhi informed the House about commencement of election for the Speaker, AIMIM state president Akhtarul Iman rose in his seat and suggested that the House “preserve its tradition of unanimous election of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker, from among the ruling side and the opposition respectively”.Notably, in the previous 16 assemblies that have been elected in Bihar, Speaker has been chosen in a contest only twice, in 1967, when the state saw its first non-Congress government, and two years later when a new assembly was formed after mid-term polls.On Tuesday, RJD’s leader in the House Tejashwi Yadav had expressed his dissatisfaction over the Deputy Speakers post having remained vacant in the previous assembly when he was asked about the decision to go against the convention of electing the Speaker unanimously.However, with no point of agreement between the ruling dispensation and the opposition in sight, Manjhi went ahead and called for voice vote. His observation that Sinha appeared to enjoy the support of the majority was furiously challenged by the opposition.Tejashwi Yadav rose in his seat and said “my constituency Raghopur falls in the district of Vaishali which is said to have been the seat of power of the world’s oldest republic, which Bihar prides itself upon. The Chair is supposed to be impartial.“Please conduct the proceedings in accordance with democratic norms, keeping in mind the fact that the Chair belongs to the House, not to the government or the opposition”.Thereafter, the pro-tem Speaker ordered a headcount, asking the members to stand in favour of their preferred candidate.Meanwhile, members of RJD, Congress and CPI(ML)  the three largest constituents of the RJD  began raising slogans and many of them rushed to the well demanding that the chief minister and ministers like Ashok Choudhary and Mukesh Sahni be asked to leave for the period till voting was over.The opposition members contention that they were not members of the assembly did not convince Manjhi who pointed out “the chief minister is the leader of the House. He, along with the Leader of the Opposition, is supposed to escort towards the Chair the member who is elected as the Speaker”.The issue saw some acidic exchanges between the Chair and the opposition. Manjhi pointed out that on many occasions, the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was seen in the Lok Sabha when voting on any matter took place even though he was a member of Rajya Sabha.When an opposition member yelled “this has no precedent in the Bihar assembly”, Manjhi, who has been an MLA for more than three decades came out with a sardonic reply.“This House has seen many precedents. When Rabri Devi was the Chief Minister, Lalu Prasad had graced the assembly with his presence despite himself then being an MP. You better not tell me about precedents,” said Manjhi who has the distinction of having served as a minister in Congress government, followed by the Lalu-Rabri regime and then under Nitish Kumar whose support enabled his brief stint as the chief minister.After Sinha was declared elected as the Speaker, acrimony gave way to propriety and the BJP leader was escorted to the Chair jointly by Nitish Kumar and Tejashwi Yadav both of whom later expressed hope that under his stewardship the House will have a smooth run.

25-11-2020||---||Modi government is scared, says farmers’ alliance Samyukt Kisan Morcha||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 25A “Samyukt Kisan Morcha” of different alliances of farmer organisations from all over India today condemned the “crackdown of BJP governments on peaceful farmers’ movements struggling for their basic entitlements”.The actions of Haryana government in arresting more than 72 farmer leaders in the state and sealing the borders with Punjab and Delhi, and the news of Uttar Pradesh government also mounting obstacles to farmers reaching Delhi to join the “Dilli Chalo” call came under severe fire from farmer leaders of different states, a statement said. “The arrogant statement of the Haryana CM that farmers struggle will not be permitted and crushed has shown the undemocratic character of the BJP government and farmers organisations have accepted the challenge of the CM---come what may, farmers will continue with the Dilli Chalo call and resist all attempts to thwart the movement,” it said. “By arresting leadership of farmers, the BJP Government is making a futile effort to arrest and imprison a nation-wide movement of millions of farmers, which is impossible and only autocratic mindsets can attempt such anti-people plans,” it added. Meanwhile, trade unions as well as political parties are organising protests against the government’s action in Haryana, in mounting criticism against the crackdown.“The Modi Government in the Centre is taking the support of BJP state governments to prevent a peaceful assembly of farmers in Delhi, where farmers want to press for the repeal of the 3 Central Farm Acts and withdrawal of the Electricity Bill 2020. This clearly shows that the government is scared about farmers and their legitimate demands. It knows that farmers are able to see through the lies and hype of the government about these new laws that have ostensibly set farmers free,” said the statement released by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha is a coordination body set up for the “Dilli Chalo” call given jointly by different farmer alliances. This includes All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh (RKMS), Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal), Bharatiya Kisan Union (Chaduni) and other farm unions. Addressing a virtual press conference organised today, members of the Coordination Committee reiterated that farmers are not going to be intimidated by such repressive tactics of the government and will march ahead with more determination and in more numbers. “The Prime Minister should note that what farmers are asking for is legitimate – they are seeking protection from exploitation at the hands of big corporations and others and not receiving remunerative prices. The government should note that this agitation is all over India and not just Punjab, where the government is extending an invitation for talks with only the Punjab farmer unions. The farmers are reminding the PM about his, his party’s and his government’s commitment about guaranteed remunerative prices to all farmers”, said the Morcha members. The Morcha reported that farmers from Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan are determined to march into Delhi and lakhs of farmers are getting mobilised.The press conference was addressed by  Hannan Mollah, Darshan Pal and Yogendra Yadav all representing All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC),  Shiv Kumar Sharma (Kakkaji) and Daljeet Singh Dallewala of Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh, and  Balbir Singh Rajewal (BKU) in addition to members of Working Group of AIKSCC like Pratibha Shinde,Ashish Mital, Tajinder Singh Virk and others.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-government-is-scared-says%C2%A0farmers-alliance-samyukt-kisan-morcha-175710
25-11-2020||Ravi S Singh||Conservation of river dolphins: Experts pitch for trans-boundary commission||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 25Experts have pitched for a trans-boundary commission between India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar to conserve river dolphins.The pitch was made during a virtual function held here to celebrate ‘International Freshwater Dolphin Day’. The function was organised under the auspices of ‘Namami Gange’.The function was marked by a webinar on ‘enhancing conservation of  river dolphins’. It was attended by experts including from the four countries.The function was originally schedule for October 24, but was postponed as it coincided with festivities and holidays in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar.The experts discussed about presence of three types of river dolphins in India – Gangetic Dolphin in Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin; Irrawaddy Dolphin in Sunderban, Odisha, etc.; and Indus Valley Dolphin in Beas (Punjab)."Building inter-governmental networking among India-Bangladesh-Nepal and Myanmar for dolphin conservation is needed,” said Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, Director General, National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG).Explaining the  uniqueness of freshwater dolphins which are found only in Asian rivers and a few South American rivers, Mishra proposed four main focus areas on dolphin   conservation. These are techno-scientific aspects, capacity building, community involvement and policy interventions.The discussion concluded with robust 12-point suggestions, which included hydrological restoration from pollution, dolphin watch protocol to be developed for tourism and creation of sanctuaries.BK Das, Director, ICAR-Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute (CIFRI) shared an update on the initiatives like "Ganga Utsav" and river  ranching program started under the aegis of the NMCG to engage communities not just in dolphin conservation but overall river rejuvenation and environment protection.Dilip Kumar, former Vice-Chancellor, CIFE-Mumbai, said: “Communities are part of the problem so they need to be involved in the solution also.”Dr JK Jena, Deputy Director General (Fisheries Science), ICAR, said: “Not only dolphins but many other aquatic animals are endangered and the situation is similar in almost all south Asian countries.”"Therefore, it is important for countries to join hands in conservation efforts,” said Dr Jena.The focus on conserving a river dolphin, which is an engendered species, is in the context of Union Government’s push for saving them from extinction through ‘Project Dolphin’.Also, in this context, the government has declared dolphin as national aquatic animal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/conservation-of-river-dolphins-experts-pitch-for-trans-boundary-commission-175709
25-11-2020||New Delhi||Late hospital admissions, rising pollution behind surge in COVID-19 deaths in Delhi, says experts||Late hospital admissions leading to COVID-19 cases turning critical, shortage of ICU beds, unfavourable weather and rising pollution are among the factors experts attribute to the spike in COVID-19 deaths in Delhi.The national capital’s COVID-19 fatality rate has increased to 1.89 per cent as against a national average of 1.46 per cent. The city has been reporting the highest number of coronavirus cases and fatalities for the last few days.Going by the epidemiological trend, the severity of the disease is more in this phase of the pandemic compared to the last one and several factors, including environmental and pollution, are contributing to it, a Health Ministry official said.Dr Samiran Panda, the head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases (ECD) Division at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said not following home isolation guidelines, late reporting to hospital despite deterioration in symptoms are some of the factors playing a major role in patients landing up at hospitals in severe conditions.“People who test COVID-19 positive and are advised home isolation should monitor their oxygen saturation levels and seek medical help if the symptoms keep deteriorating. Seeking help early would ensure timely treatment,” he said.Medical Superintendent of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital Rana AK Singh said change in weather and rising pollution are compounding the problems.“People are more prone to flu, cold and cough in this season. Those suffering from respiratory diseases are facing exacerbation of the symptoms. On the top of that, if timely help is not sought, that leads to adverse outcomes,” Dr Rana stressed.Considering the increased burden on ICU beds in the national capital, the RML Hospital medical superintendent said the Union Health Ministry has asked the three Centre-run hospitals—Safdarjung Hospital, RML Hospital and Lady Hardinge Hospital—to enhance the ICU beds.“And we are trying to do that,” he said.Dr DS Rana, chairman of board, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said that patients are reaching hospitals when the oxygen saturation levels falls below 90 per cent and condition has become severe.“Further, ICUs in many hospitals are full as a result of which a patient whose condition has already deteriorated has to wait in a ward for a longer duration which increases the complicities. This is where seeking medical help on time helps,” he underlined.Delhi recorded over 100 daily deaths in seven of the last 13 days. A total of 109 fatalities were recorded on Tuesday, as against 121 each on Monday and Sunday, 111 on Saturday, 118 on Friday, 131 on November 18 -- the highest till date—and 104 fatalities on November 12.A senior doctor at a Delhi government hospital attributed the high number of daily COVID-19 deaths to a large number of “critical” non-resident patients coming to the city for treatment.Also, easing of restrictions has exposed the vulnerable population—the elderly and those with comorbidities—to the deadly virus, the doctor said.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reserve 1,000 ICU beds for Delhiites in Centre-run hospitals like AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital as he underlined that the high severity of the third wave of COVID-19 cases in the national capital was due to many factors with pollution being a significant one.During a COVID-19 review meeting convened by the prime minister, Kejriwal said if the Centre reserves these ICU beds in its hospitals in the city for the people of Delhi amid a surge in coronavirus case, “it will be a great support to us”. Delhi recorded 6,224 fresh COVID-19 cases on Tuesday and a positivity rate of 10.14 per cent while 109 more fatalities pushed the death toll to 8,621.The national capital had recorded its highest single-day spike of 8,593 cases on November 11 when 85 fatalities linked to the disease were also registered. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/late-hospital-admissions-rising-pollution-behind-surge-in-covid-19-deaths-in-delhi-says-experts-175706

25-11-2020||New Delhi||Centre asks states to take steps to reopen medical colleges from or before December 1||The Union Health Ministry asked state governments on Wednesday  to initiate steps for reopening of medical colleges from December 1 or before it, but with strict adherence to all COVID-19 related guidelines.Educational institutions in the country have been closed since March in view of the coronavirus pandemic.In a letter to the chief secretaries and the administrators of all states and Union Territories, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan also suggested making non-COVID beds available in sufficient numbers in affiliated medical college-hospitals to facilitate undergraduate training.The Health Ministry has obtained concurrence from the Ministry of Home Affairs for re-opening of medical colleges, the letter mentioned.“Accordingly, the states and UTs may take necessary steps to open the medical colleges on or before December 1, 2020,” the health secretary said in his letter dated November 25.“Needless to say, all SOPs/guidelines with respect to social distancing and prevention of spread of epidemic issued by Central/states and UT governments will be followed scrupulously by all the colleges,” he said.The Centre's directive comes in the wake of the National Medical Commission recommending reopening of medical colleges from December 1 or before it for the MBBS students already pursuing their courses.The NMC, which has received representations from students and medical colleges, noted that the current batch of interns (2020) have not completed their required clinical training and unless they do it, they would not be eligible for appearing for the PG-NEET exam.It also noted that the PG-NEET exam for the academic year 2021-22 has been delayed as the eligible candidates will be completing their training late.Their training is required to be completed at the earliest so that the PG -NEET exam for the academic year 2021-22 can be held accordingly, it said."Delay in resuming the training would have a cascading effect on training of next PG and super-speciality courses in the coming years," the NMC noted."The delayed new academic session for 2020-21 should commence from February 1, 2021. The new PG session for the academic year 2020-21 should begin from at least July 1, 2021 and therefore the PG-NEET exam for AY 2020-21 would need to be scheduled around March-April 2021," the NMC said in a communique to the Health Ministry on November 12.With opening of medical colleges and to facilitate UG training, all medical colleges affiliated hospitals would need to have sufficient number of beds for non-COVID patients and hence facilities for both outpatient and inpatient management for non-COVID patients must be re-started, if not already done, the NMC stated.Further, it noted that the students today (and would-be doctors tomorrow) should also be familiar with the inherent threats and opportunities in healthcare systems which they would eventually handle themselves.It should not become a missed opportunity for medical students to learn the skills of epidemic management as public health professional, the NMC said.

25-11-2020||---||Cabinet approves union of Lakshmi Vilas Bank with DBS Bank||New Delhi, November 25The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the amalgamation of Lakshmi Vilas Bank Limited (LVB) with DBS Bank India Limited (DBIL).The merger has been done to protect depositors’ interest and in the interest of financial and banking stability, said an official news release.LVB was under moratorium for 30 days. In parallel, RBI, in consultation with the Government, superseded the Board of Directors of LVB and appointed an Administrator to protect the depositors' interest.After inviting suggestions and objections from the public and stakeholders, RBI prepared and provided a scheme for the bank's amalgamation and pushed it for government's sanction well in advance of the end of the period of moratorium so that restrictions on withdrawal faced by the depositors were minimised.With the approval of the scheme, LVB will be amalgamated with DBIL from the appointed date, and with this there will be no further restrictions on the depositors regarding withdrawal of their deposits, read the release.DBIL is a banking company licenced by RBI with a strong balance sheet, and has the advantage of a strong parentage of DBS, a leading financial services group in Asia, with presence in 18 markets and headquartered and listed in Singapore. The combined balance sheet of DBIL would remain healthy even after amalgamation and its branches would increase to 600.The speedy amalgamation and resolution of the stress in LVB is in line with the government's commitment to a clean banking system while protecting the interests of depositors and the public as well as the financial system, the release added.The Cabinet also approved the equity infusion of Rs 6,000 crore in the NIIF Debt Platform sponsored by National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), comprising Aseem Infrastructure Finance Limited (AIFL) and NIIF Infrastructure Finance Limited (NIIF-IFL).During the current year, only Rs 2,000 crore would be allocated. Even this amount may be disbursed only if there is readiness and demand for debt raising.This was one of the 12 key measures announced by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as part of the government’s AatmaNirbhar Bharat 3.0 announcement on November 12.The NIIF Infrastructure Debt Financing Platform is expected to contribute nearly Rs 1 lakh crore in debt to the infrastructure sector over the next five years. It will act as a catalyst in attracting more investments into the infrastructure sector as envisaged in the National Infrastructure Pipeline.The process will also help relieve exposure of banks to infrastructure projects and free up space for new green-field projects.It is expected that a well-capitalised and well-funded NIIF Debt Platform can play a major role in infrastructure financing and development of the bond market in India by acting as an intermediary between the bond markets and infrastructure projects and companies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cabinet-approves-union-of-lakshmi-vilas-bank-with-dbs-bank-175681
25-11-2020||Kolkata||BJP, TMC clash in Birbhum, bombs hurled||Crude bombs were hurled and stones thrown at passing vehicles when ruling TMC and BJP activists clashed on way to a rally by the saffron party’s state unit president Dilip Ghosh in West Bengal’s Birbhum district on Wednesday.Police said the clash broke out when BJP activists travelling in a mini truck to the rally at Suri had an altercation with the local TMC workers while passing through Simurali in the district.As the vehicle’s windscreen was broken in the brick batting, the BJP men alighted from the vehicle and a clash ensued in which crude bombs were freely hurled.Many other vehicles, including two wheelers, which were passing through the area were damaged by the warring groups.A police team from Bolpur rushed to the spot and burst tear gas shells to quell the mob and cleared the highway.The clash, however, spilled to nearby village roads and the police intervend to bring the situation under control.BJP supporters have alleged that two of their supporters were injured in the firing by TMC activists during the clash but this was not confirmed by police.Ghosh later told reporters after a road show and the public meeting at Suri that the TMC tried to stop BJP members from attending his meeting and resorted to violent means to terrorise them. “But they will not succeed”.“Two of our supporters have been wounded in firing by TMC goons. But they cannot stop BJP this way. We will come to power (in the state polls) and ensure that the perpetrators and conspirators behind such attacks are punished,” he said.“We are taking note of every such attack, every single false case slapped against BJP workers.

It was 388 on Tuesday.It was 302 on Monday, 274 on Sunday, 251 on Saturday, 296 on Friday and 283 on Thursday.The capital’s AQI was in the “severe” category on November 15, a day after Diwali, but later improved and remained in either “poor” or “moderate” category until November 22.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.According to Ministry of Earth Sciences’ monitoring system SAFAR, stubble fire counts were quite low at 63 on Tuesday with its share in PM2.5 in Delhi’s air at two per cent on Wednesday.       “Effective stubble fire counts with sufficient potential as estimated from SAFAR-multi-satellite products are low (around 63). Hence, the stubble burning share in PM2.5 in Delhi’s air is estimated as two per cent for today,” it said.It forecasted winds to pick up and improve the ventilation condition by Thursday.“The AQI is forecasted to improve towards ‘very poor’ category by tomorrow and likely stay in the lower end of Very Poor on November 27 and 28,” SAFAR said.Stubble burning accounted for five per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution on Tuesday, six per cent on Monday and 12 per cent on Sunday. It was 13 per cent on Saturday, 15 per cent on Friday and 20 per cent on Thursday. The maximum and minimum temperatures in the city on Wednesday settled at 24.4 degrees Celsius and 10.4 degrees Celsius with cloudy sky. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-air-quality-slips-to-severe-due-to-slow-winds-175672
25-11-2020||New Delhi||Ahmed Patel: Cong loses its key strategist, troubleshooter and consensus-building man||Ahmed Patel was the Congress' man for all seasons and every reason, the quintessential backroom strategist who maintained a studied low profile but held a steel-grip over the party's affairs as he helped steer it through the potholed roads of changing political landscapes. Babubhai and AP to friends and Ahmed Bhai to colleagues, Patel died early Wednesday in a Gurugram hospital where he was admitted with COVID-19, till the very end the staunch Congress loyalist famed for his crisis management skills and also the consensus-building abilities that helped him make friends across the spectrum. The 71-year-old remained Sonia Gandhi's most trusted lieutenant for most of her tenure as the longest-serving Congress president, standing by her side through sun and shade.She described him as a leader dedicated to the party and one whose assets of faithfulness, dedication, commitment to duty, willingness to help and generosity distinguished him from others. "I have lost an irreplaceable comrade, a faithful colleague and a friend," she said in her condolence message, voicing her anguish at Patel's departure at a time of acute internal friction in the Congress.Just three months ago, in August, Patel stepped in to quell a rebellion. His firm rejection of the public stand taken by 23 party leaders against Sonia Gandhi helped the Congress Working Committee snub the demand for replacement of a Gandhi as party chief and repose faith in her presidency after she offered to quit.He was a Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat and All India Congress Committee treasurer. But was actually so much more. Mild-mannered and affable, the rise of Patel from a party worker in Gujarat to its key strategist and troubleshooter was a testament to his grit, talent and ideological commitment.The Congress' most astute politician, who controlled the Congress organisation with a silent yet firmly persuasive style, would often say "no one is indispensable" but everyone in the party knows that "this is just not true". Even outside the Congress, Patel's legendary political instinct and acuity held him in good stead across parties with politicians across hues falling back on him for political advice. He was key in forging the UPA alliance in 2004.Patel was forever a votary of internal discussions on matters of concern in the Congress, leading by example and never speaking if he didn't have to. Patel's importance in the Congress dates back to the days of the late Rajiv Gandhi. When Rajiv Gandhi became prime minister, he did away with the post of principal secretary to the PM which his mother Indira Gandhi had created for PN Haksar and appointed three parliamentary secretaries -- Ahmed Patel, Arun Singh and Oscar Fernandes.When Sonia Gandhi became party president in April 1998, she appointed Ambika Soni as her first political secretary only to replace her with Patel in 2001. He served in the post till he took his last breath today. He later took charge of the Congress's organisational structure both in Gujarat and at the AICC. Though Patel never became minister, he remained kingmaker, playing a pivotal role in decision making throughout the Congress-led UPA I and UPA II years. And right through the decades, the eight-time parliamentarian with five terms in the Rajya Sabha and three in the Lok Sabha maintained a low profile, a stark contrast from the archetypal politician scrambling to be in the media spotlight. Born in August 1949 at Piraman village in Gujarat's Bharuch district, Patel began his political career by contesting the local body polls in Bharuch in 1976. He was first elected to the Lok Sabha from Bharuch at a young age of 28 in 1977. He also served as AICC general secretary from September 1985 to January 1986 and May 1992 to October 1996. He was also a member of the CWC from April 1992 onwards and the party treasurer from October 1996 to July 2000.He won his election to the Rajya Sabha from Gujarat against all odds recently. It was a nail-biting finish after some party MLAs allegedly switched sides. The cancellation of the secret vote of a Congress MLA, who had made it public, clinched the seat for him.Patel was also AICC treasurer, a leader with a complete hold of the Congress'  institutional history and a hold on all its power keys.The kind-hearted 'Babubhai' to his friends, relatives and well-wishers in his home state, Patel was a pivotal figure in Delhi but his influence in his home state did not diminish. Many Congress leaders in Gujarat would project that they had Patel's 'blessings' and claimed he guided them like a father figure.A Hindutva surge led to him losing to the BJP when he contested Lok Sabha elections for the fourth time in 1989. He was then elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1993.Those who knew him in political and media circles in Gujarat said Patel had the ability to charm people with his mild manner and would always make it a point to reach out to people during their good and bad times.He was also involved in social works in Bharuch district, where he worked to provide medical facilities to people by setting up a big hospital.Patel had announced on Twitter on October 1 that he had tested positive for COVID-19.Five days later, on October 6, he posted a condolence message to Chirag Paswan expressing shock at the death of his father Ram Vilas Paswan.That was possibly his last tweet. A veteran journalist recalled that before Patel tested COVID-19 positive, he had been regularly calling many people, including media persons, in Gujarat to ask about their well-being.

25-11-2020||New Delhi||Amravati Land Scam Case: SC lifts gag order||The Supreme Court on Wednesday lifted the gag order passed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court restraining the media from reporting about an FIR registered by the state police on Amaravati land scam, allegedly involving a former advocate general and two daughters of a top court judge.The order came from a three-judge Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan on an appeal filed by the YS Jaganmohan Reddy Government challenging an Andhra Pradesh High Court's order that restrained the media from reporting on the issue. The high court had also stayed the probe into the case.Issuing notices to the respondents, the Bench posted the matter for final hearing in the last week of January 2021.The top court asked the Andhra Pradesh High Court not to dispose of the former advocate general's petition against FIR during the pendency of the matter before it.Senior counsel Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, representing the former advocate general and others, submitted that it was a case of political vendetta and ‘regime revenge’.They contended there was no illegality in purchasing land in 2015 as thousands of people did so since June 2014 after it became public that Andhra Pradesh's capital was being shifted to Amaravati.On behalf of the state government, senior advocate Rajiv Dhavan submitted, "This is an entire political writ petition against the Chief Minister. The plea is based not on facts, but reliable sources which too are not revealed."The Anti-Corruption Bureau of Andhra Pradesh Police had registered an FIR against the former advocate general, two daughters of a sitting Supreme Court judge and 11 others, accusing them of purchasing land in Amaravati -- proposed capital of the state -- as they had prior information about the decision.But the high court had restrained the media from reporting and stayed the probe into the case.The Andhra Pradesh government had moved the top court on September 21 against the high court's order.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amravati-land-scam-case-sc-lifts-gag-order-175652

25-11-2020||Mumbai||COVID-19 virus survives on surfaces within thin films: IIT B study||The COVID-19 virus survives on surfaces by clinging to thin liquid films, according to a study by researchers at IIT-Bombay which provides insights into how the novel coronavirus sustains for hours or days on solid surfaces under ambient conditions.The study, published in the journal Physics of Fluids, attributes the long survival time of the novel coronavirus on a surface to the slow evaporation of a thin nanometre liquid film remaining after the evaporation of the bulk droplet.The ability to predict the survival of the novel coronavirus on different surfaces can help prevent and contain the spread of COVID-19, the researchers said.While the typical respiratory droplets dry within seconds, the survival time of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on different surfaces within recent experiments has been found to be on the order of hours, they said.This discrepancy suggests an orders of magnitude difference in the time between droplet drying and the survival time of the COVID-19 virus on surfaces, according to the researchers.The researchers described how a nanometres-thick liquid film clings to the surface, due to London-van der Waals forces, which allows the COVID-19 virus to survive for hours.Van der Waals forces include attraction and repulsions between atoms, molecules, and surfaces, as well as other intermolecular forces."Our model for the thin film transport shows that survival or drying time of a thin liquid film on a surface is on the order of hours and days, similar to what has been observed in measurements of the virus titer," said Amit Agrawal, professor at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay."It captures the relatively longer survival time on plastic and glass compared to metals," Agrawal said.A titer is the lowest concentration of virus that still infects cells.The nanometric film is assumed to be like a pancake deposited onto a surface. The researchers briefly examined changes in drying time as a function of contact angle and surface type."Our biggest surprise was that the drying time of this nanometric film is on the order of hours," said Rajneesh Bhardwaj, a professor at IIT Bombay."It suggests the surface isn't completely dry, and the slowly evaporating nanometric film is providing the medium required for the survival of the coronavirus," Bhardwaj said.Since a longer survival time of the virus corresponds to increased chances of being infected, the researchers said it is desirable to disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as door handles or hand-held devices, and within hospitals and other areas prone to outbreaks."We also recommend heating surfaces, because even short duration high temperatures, at which the surface is at a higher temperature than the ambient, can help evaporate the nanometric film and destroy the virus," Bhardwaj added.

25-11-2020||Bengaluru||Sweden getting on board India's Venus mission with payload to explore planet||Sweden is getting on board India's Venus orbiter mission 'Shukrayaan' with a scientific instrument to explore the planet.Ambassador of Sweden to India, Klas Molin said Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF) is engaged in the venture, its second collaborative project with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)."IRF's satellite instrument Venusian Neutrals Analyzer (VNA) will study how the charged particles from the Sun interact with the atmosphere and exosphere of the planet", he told PTI."The new Venus mission means that the collaboration between IRF and ISRO continues".The VNA would be the ninth generation of IRFs series of miniatured ion and ENA (Energetic Neutral Atoms) instruments, according to Swedish officials.The first generation was named SARA (Sub-keV Atom Reflecting Analyzer) and was launched on board the Indian spacecraft Chandrayaan-1 that explored the Moon in 2008-2009.SARA consisted of two sensors.One was a detector for energetic neutral atoms and the other was an instrument to measure the flow of ions in the solar wind.The instrument studied how the plasma around the Moon interacts with the moon where the surface is not protected by an atmosphere or a magnetic field, they said."For the first time ever, SARA could investigate energetic atoms that are knocked from the lunar surface when they are hit by the solar wind", Swedish officials said.The SARA experiment was the first collaborative project between IRF and the ISRO.On collaboration in general with India in the field of space, Molin said Sweden has quite a lot to provide, both from its institutions and from space tech companies.He said India has a clear ambition to explore the universe, other planets and to send humans to space."This segment includes to a large extent R&D effort, both regarding space technologies and services." "The unique Space Tech Testbed capability at Esrange can also carry out even more advanced tests of equipment and technologies that should be used in exploration campaigns", Molin said.On future prospects in the space field between the two countries, the Ambassador noted that India has recently created National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) to provide a level playing field for private companies to use Indian space infrastructure.This is part of reforms aimed at giving a boost to private sector participation in the entire range of space activities, he said."The future is exciting as India is opening the space market for commercial player participation and easing import- export restrictions, including 100 per cent FDI allowed in satellite development and deployment.It is important to underline that ISRO will remain as the main Indian customer in the coming years, but the market growth could be exponential", Molin said.According to ISRO officials, the Indian space agency has short-listed 20 space-based experiment proposals, including from France, for its proposed Venus mission to study the planet for more than four years.They include "collaborative contributions" from Russia, France, Sweden and Germany.ISRO was eyeing June, 2023 for the country's first mission to Venus."But we are currently reviewing this mission timeline due to delays arising from the pandemic situation", an ISRO official said."Future launch opportunity is either in 2024 or 2026".It was noted that optimal launch window (when Venus is closest to the Earth) comes about every 19 months.Of the Indian and international payload proposals it received in response to an announcement of opportunity for novel space-based experiments to study Venus, ISRO has short- listed 20 and they are currently under review.The one already selected, according to French space agency CNES, is France's VIRAL instrument (Venus Infrared Atmospheric Gas Linker) co-developed with the Russian space agency Roscosmos, and the LATMOS atmospheres, environments and space observations laboratory attached to the French national scientific research centre CNRS.Scientific objectives of ISRO's Venus mission are investigation of the surface processes and shallow subsurface stratigraphy; and solar wind interaction with Venusian Ionosphere, and studying the structure, composition and dynamics of the atmosphere, according ISRO.The payload capability of the proposed 2500-kg satellite, planned to be launched on GSLV Mk II rocket, is likely to be 175 kg with 500W of power.The proposed orbit is expected to be around 500 x 60,000 km around Venus.This orbit is likely to be reduced gradually, over several months to a lower apoapsis (farthest point).

25-11-2020||Jodhpur||Hindu woman from Pak reunited with Indian family after being stranded in neighbouring country for 10 months||A Hindu refugee from Pakistan was reunited with her family in India on Tuesday after being stranded in the neighbouring country for 10 months.Janta Mali, who has applied for Indian citizenship, had gone to visit her ailing mother in Pakistan's Mirpur Khas in February on an NORI visa with her husband and children, who are Indian citizens, but was not allowed to travel back after the imposition of a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus as her visa expired. She got stranded in the neighbouring country while her husband and children travelled back to India in July.The woman was denied permission to board the train to India with her husband and children.An NORI visa allows Pakistani nationals holding a Long Term Visa (LTV) and staying in India to travel to the neighbouring country and return within 60 days.In September, the Union home ministry had told the Rajasthan High Court that 410 Pakistani Hindu refugees, who were stranded in Pakistan due to the expiry of their NORI visa periods, were identified."These refugees were staying in India on Long Term Visa (LTV) and had gone to Pakistan for a short trip before the lockdown on NORI (No Objection for Return to India) visa," Sajjan Singh, an amicus curiae appointed by the court on issues pertaining to Pakistan's minority migrants, said.The home ministry had then stated that these people would be brought back to the country soon by extending their visa terms.Two shuttle services were rolled out after the lifting of the lockdown to help them return in July, but these 410 people were left out due to the expiry of their visas.Seemant Lok Sangthan president Hindu Singh Sodha said the organisation had taken up the issue with the Rajasthan government as well as the Centre."We have urged the government to pave the way for the return of all such persons, who are stuck in Pakistan due to the expiry of their NORI visas," he said."After six months' struggle, we succeeded in bringing back Mali, who was stuck in Pakistan due to the lockdown," Sodha added.

Apart from coastal and north-interior Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karakkal, a red alert has also been sounded for heavy to extremely heavy rains in Rayalseema.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spoken to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister EK Palaniswami and Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasami, assuring all help. Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba told a National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) meeting with Chief Secretaries of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Andhra Pradesh and Secretaries of different ministries on Tuesday that the aim should be to ensure that there is no loss of life, damage is minimum and normalcy is restored in power, telecom and other important sectors in shortest possible time.The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has deployed rescue personnel in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry. DG, NDRF, talked about the preparedness to meet the situation in next three days and said that 30 teams of NDRF had so far been deployed and 20 additional teams had been kept on standby for Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Andhra Pradesh.Fishermen have been advised not to venture into the sea and the people in coastal areas are also being evacuated to shelter houses. The Cabinet Secretary assured all necessary Central assistance to the state governments to overcome the situation.Tidal wave of about 1 to 1.5 metre height above the astronomical tide is very likely to inundate the low-lying areas of north coastal districts of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry near the place of landfall. Damage is expected over Nagapattinam, Myladuthurai, Cuddalore  Villupuram and Chengalpattu districts of Tamil Nadu and Karaikal and Puducherry, the IMD said. It includes total destruction of thatched houses/extensive damage to kutcha houses and some damage to old pucca houses. There is potential threat from flying objects and bending/uprooting of power and communication poles. Widespread damage is also expected to standing crops, plantations, orchards in Tamil Nadu and parts of adjoining Andhra Pradesh, the IMD said.

25-11-2020||New Delhi||Will go by scientific advice on vaccine: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said India was keeping a close watch on Covid-19 vaccine developments, which were in final stages, and would follow scientific advice on the matter.Virtually addressing the Chief Ministers of the eight worst-hit states — Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Delhi, West Bengal, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Maharashtra — the PM warned against lowering the guard against the virus while planning for the vaccine rollout. He asked them to establish cold storage facilities and set up structures down to the block level to prepare for inoculation drives.Describing as “worrisome” the recent surge in some states, Modi urged the CMs to keep positivity rate below 5 per cent and case fatality rate below 1 per cent.“We are in the fourth stage of pandemic control. With the rising recovery rate, people have developed a false notion of security from the virus, leading to negligence. It’s a must to re-awaken people to the dangers of this virus,” said the PM, asking the CMs to step up awareness. He said India’s Covid vaccine plan would be ready soon and asked the states to send inputs on priority groups for inoculation.The Centre has, meanwhile, counted one crore health workers for the first stage of vaccination. On the vaccine, the PM said he couldn’t stop people from politicising the issue and that he would follow scientific advice on the matter. His reference was to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi yesterday asking which vaccine would India use.Modi said answers on vaccine dosage or pricing were not available yet, though the government was in touch with local and global developers to ensure the vaccine was procured in time.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-go-by-scientific-advice-on-vaccine-pm-175360

25-11-2020||New Delhi||$20 Sputnik shots likely in India by January||A single dose of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine will cost less than $10 in international market while the two-dose regimen would cost $20 (around Rs 1,400), announced Krill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, at a webinar on Tuesday.Two-dose regimenAt the launch, the vaccine would cost half or even less than other mRNA vaccines with similar efficacy, claimed Dmitriev. The RDIF and its partners have launched production of the lyophilised (dry) form of the vaccine, which is stored at a temperature of 2 to 8°C. Such a regime enables the distribution of the vaccine in international markets as well as expanding its use in hard-to-reach regions.The current agreements between the RDIF and leading foreign pharmaceutical companies allow the Sputnik V vaccine to be produced abroad for 500 million people per year, starting from 2021. The first international deliveries of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine will be made to customers in January 2021.The second interim analysis of clinical trial data showed a 91.4 per cent efficacy 28 days after the first dose; efficacy is over 95 per cent 42 days after the first dose, said its makers Gamaleya Institute.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/20-sputnik-shots-likely-in-india-by-january-175366
25-11-2020||---||Indo-US ties to strengthen with focus on human rights||Among Joe Biden’s picks are nominees to two crucial posts — Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan – who are old subcontinental hands and, like the US President-elect, have pushed for closer ties with India, especially in the Indo-Pacific, and against China.India useful partner to deal with ChinaHowever, the evidence of their stints in the Obama administration and their recent observations on India show that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is unlikely to get a free pass on the CAA and the NRC. He may also be nudged from his hard-line position of not talking to Pakistan and asserting that all that remains to be discussed on Kashmir is handing over the occupied part to India.Already, Democratic Party supporters have urged Blinken to include India in the State Department’s list of “countries of particular concern”.“A strong US-India strategic partnership should be anchored in an understanding that the geopolitical interests of both countries are best served by advancing democracy, human rights and religious freedom,” reasoned the Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) in a statement.It appealed to Blinken, the “stepson of a Holocaust survivor’’, to ensure that the US introduces specific reference to pluralism and freedom in all future pacts with India in trade and defence cooperation. It also wanted Blinken, whom it briefed in April this year on the CAA and the NRC, to pursue modifications in both laws to end the “inherent anti-Muslim bias”. Both Sullivan and Blinken are clear that the US’ strategic future in the subcontinent lies with India. At the same time, they are mindful of the need to preserve geopolitical stability in South Asia.It may be a coincidence but Blinken was in India in 2015 and shortly thereafter, then Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj travelled to Islamabad followed by PM Modi’s surprise touchdown in Pakistan to meet its then PM Nawaz Sharif.Blinken, as a matter of policy approach, is in favour of “engaging with a partner about areas where you have difference even as you are working to build a greater cooperation and strengthen the relationship going forward”.But India can breathe easy on the Iran front as Sullivan has been clear about negotiating on the Iran nuclear deal. It can also look forward to a structured discussion on trade issues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indo-us-ties-to-strengthen-with-focus-on-human-rights-175375
