Jaswantnagar is his (Shivpal Yadav’s) seat and the Samajwadi Party vacated the seat for him. In the coming times, we will make their leader a cabinet minister, and what other adjustment is needed?”                                  Legislative Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh are scheduled in February-March 2022.Shivpal Yadav, the estranged uncle of Akhilesh Yadav, was elected from the Jaswantnagar assembly constituency in the 2017 state elections.He later floated a new political party, Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia), and contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections on its symbol from Firozabad.Accusing the BJP of using “deceit” for defeating the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ (led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal) in the recently concluded Bihar assembly elections, Akhilesh Yadav said, “The maximum public support was seen at the Mahagathbandhan rallies and all the surveys hinted towards a historic victory for it. But, when the EVMs were opened for the counting of votes, the results were stopped midway and the victory certificates were handed to someone else.”      When asked about the performance of the SP in the recently held bypolls to seven assembly seats in UP, Akhilesh Yadav said, “When the elections are contested by the election officers, superintendents of police, additional district magistrates, SHOs and police jawans, who will win then.”        “The BJP was not contesting the bypolls but the officials of its government,” he added.The SP chief hit out at the BJP government, saying corruption and injustice have become rampant in the state.“If someone is insulting people and giving them problems, they will overthrow that government as and when they will get an opportunity,” he said.A number of leaders and workers from the Congress and the BSP joined the SP in the presence of Akhilesh Yadav on the occasion.The joining of the leaders from other parties will strengthen the SP, Akhilesh Yadav said.

14-11-2020||Longewala (Rajasthan)||India will give ‘prachand jawab’ if it is tested, says Modi at Rajasthan's Longewala||Delivering an unambiguous message to India’s enemies, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday asserted that it would give a “prachand jawab” (fierce reply) if provoked, as he flew to Longewala Post to celebrate Diwali with soldiers, a custom he has been observing since assuming office in 2014.Addressing soldiers at the forward post, which has become a part of military legend after troops here successfully thwarted numerically higher Pakistani forces in the 1971 war, Modi took a swipe at China without naming it, saying the world is troubled by “expansionist forces” and expansionism shows a “distorted mindset” that belongs to the 18th century.India had become a forceful voice against forces of expansionism, he said and also took aim at Pakistan, adding that Indian soldiers have hit “sponsors of terrorism” in their home, a reference to air and surgical strikes against terror camps in the neighbouring country.“No force in the world can prevent our brave soldiers from defending our borders… The world today knows that we will not compromise with our interests even one bit at any cost,” he said amid a standoff with China at Ladakh border.He said India today believed in the policy of understanding others and making them understand but if it was tested, then it would give a fierce reply. The country had the capability and political will to give a befitting response to those who challenge it, he added.The Prime Minister also underlined the importance of having strong capability, saying despite advanced international cooperation and equations, vigilance is the path to security, alertness leads to happiness and peace is the prize of having strength.“History of the world tells us that only those nations have remained safe and advanced who had the ability to take on invaders,” he said, adding that 130 crore Indians stood with the country’s soldiers and bow to their bravely.“They are proud of your valour,” he told soldiers, saying their bravery has got better of all adversities, be it in deserts, forests or deep oceans.Modi said his Diwali was complete only after he came among soldiers, adding he could not stay away from his own on this festival. He said the more time he spent with the soldiers, the stronger his resolve to serve and protect the country got.“Your sacrifices teach the country discipline and sense of service,” the Prime Minister told soldiers, referring to his government’s efforts to combat the coronavirus and also to restart the economic activity fully.Urging soldiers to make innovation and yoga a part of their daily lives, he also asked them to learn one language other than Hindi, English and their mother tongue, saying it will enrich their lives.The Prime Minister referred to his government’s stress on self-reliance and ‘vocal for local’ campaign and complimented the Armed Forces for the decision to bar import over 100 weapons and defence equipment.Recalling the glorious battle of Longewala, he said it would always be remembered in the annals of strategic planning and military valour.He said this was the time when the ugly face of Pakistan was exposed as its army was terrorizing innocent citizens of Bangladesh and committing atrocities against women.“Pakistan opened the front on the western border to divert the global attention but our forces gave them a befitting reply,” he said.On the occasion, he recalled the fierce fight the post had witnessed in the 1971 war against Pakistan and paid tributes to Brig Kuldeep Singh Chandpuri, a hero of the battle who was then a Major, saying he became “rashtra deep” with his feat of bravery.It was also an example of exemplary coordination among the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, he said.India had defeated Pakistan in the 1971 war, leading to the independence of Bangladesh.Modi has been visiting forward posts every Diwali since his government came to power in 2014.He was in Rajouri last year, in Uttarakhand in 2018 and in Gurez in 2017.

14-11-2020||Washington||US pitches for free and open Indo-Pacific at Asean Summit||US National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien has pitched for a free and open Indo-Pacific, a strategic region that has witnessed renewed global focus in view of China's expansionist behaviour.Addressing the US-ASEAN virtual summit on Friday, O'Brien highlighted the tremendous benefit the partnership has brought to the prosperity, security and well-being of over one billion people in the United States and ASEAN nations, the White House said in a statement.He reaffirmed the US' longstanding commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific, it said.The ASEAN is considered one of the most influential groupings in the region, and India and several other countries including the US, China, Japan and Australia are its dialogue partners.The virtual ASEAN summit, which kicked off on Thursday, is taking place amid China's aggressive behaviour in the disputed South China Sea. A number of ASEAN countries have territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea.Beijing claims almost all of the 1.3 million square-mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region which, in parts, is claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.Beijing has impeded commercial activity like fishing and mineral exploration by neighbouring nations in recent years, saying the ownership of the resource-rich maritime territory belongs to China for hundreds of years.The 10 member countries of ASEAN are Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.O'Brien, who participated in the Summit as Donald Trump's Special Envoy, shared a message on behalf of the President welcoming the 5th anniversary of the US-ASEAN Strategic Partnership.Trump attended the ASEAN summit in 2017, but sent only representatives during the last two meetings. A special summit with the ASEAN that he was supposed to host in Las Vegas in March was called off due to the COVID-19 pandemic.O'Brien will also represent the US at an East Asia virtual summit on Saturday.The East Asia Summit (EAS) is the premier forum in the Asia-Pacific region to deal with issues relating security and defence. Since its inception in 2005, it has played a significant role in the strategic, geopolitical and economic evolution of East Asia.The virtual summit on Saturday will be chaired by Prime Minister of Vietnam Nguyen Xuan Phuc, and will see participation from all the 18 EAS countries.Apart from the 10 ASEAN member states, the East Asia Summit includes India, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia, New Zealand, the US and Russia.

14-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality very poor, likely to become ‘severe’ by night||Delhi’s air quality remained “very poor” on Saturday morning and emission from firecrackers and calm winds may push it to the “severe” zone, according to government agencies and weather experts.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the PM2.5 concentration in Delhi on Diwali is likely to be the “lowest” in the last four years if no firecrackers are burnt.Pollution levels in Delhi during the Diwali period were likely to remain in the higher end of the “very poor” category in the absence of emissions due to fireworks, it said.But two factors – smoke from farm fires and stagnant surface winds – will keep the air quality in the higher end of the “very poor” category to the lower end of the “severe” on Diwali night, it said.The Central Government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said: “The air quality in Delhi-NCR is likely to deteriorate further and enter the ‘severe’ category by evening.”SAFAR said transport-level winds had become northwesterly and the stubble burning-induced impact on air quality index (AQI) is expected to increase.A spike in PM2.5 levels in the early hours of Sunday was likely if firecrackers were burnt, it said.The city recorded an AQI of 373 at 10 am on Saturday, which falls in the “very poor” category. However, several monitoring stations, including at ITO (406), Alipur (422), Jahangirpuri (431), Rohini (403), Vivek Vihar (415), Narela (418), Bawana (430), Mundka (405) and Anand Vihar (429), recorded their AQI in the “severe” category.The 24-hour average AQI was 339 on Friday and 314 on Thursday.The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (323), Ghaziabad (412), Noida (362), Greater Noida (350), and Gurgaon (338), which fall in the National Capital Region (NCR), also recorded their AQI is the “very poor” and “severe” categories.Delhi recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 337 on Diwali last year (October 27), and 368 and 400 in the next two days. Thereafter, pollution levels remained in the “severe” category for three days on the trot.In 2018, the 24-hour average AQI (281) on Diwali was recorded in the “poor” category. It deteriorated to 390 the next day and remained in the “severe” category on three consecutive days thereafter.In 2017, Delhi’s 24-hour average AQI on Diwali (October 19) stood at 319. It, however, slipped into the “severe” zone the next day.This time, the India Meteorological Department has said a fresh western disturbance was likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in Delhi-NCR post Diwali.“Light rain is likely on Sunday under the influence of a western disturbance. It is still to be seen if it is enough to wash away pollutants,” Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre said.“However, Delhi-NCR’s air quality is likely to improve post Diwali due to an expected increase in the wind speed on Sunday,” he said.VK Soni, the head of the IMD’s environment research centre, said calm winds and firecrackers emissions may push the air quality to the “severe” zone on Diwali night.The wind speed was expected to pick up thereafter and the wind direction will be east-southeasterly, he said.There would be a significant improvement in air quality by November 16, Soni said.The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi also said the situation is likely to “improve significantly” on Sunday.“Under the influence of a Western Disturbance, isolated rainfall over plains of northwest India and adjoining central India is likely on Sunday. The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from East-Southeast direction of Delhi with wind speed up to 20 kmph,” it said.“Generally cloudy sky, light rain, thundershowers accompanied with gusty winds (speed 30-40 kmph) is likely towards afternoon-evening on Sunday,” the central agency said.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Friday directed the CPCB and states concerned to ensure there is no lapse in the implementation of the National Green Tribunal’s directions in view of the air quality scenario during the Diwali period.“In pursuance of NGT order dated November 9 and considering the concerns of air quality scenario in the NCR and its adverse health impact, the Commission directed CPCB, state governments and authorities concerned for strict compliance of the directions of NGT, with zero tolerance on violation,” it said.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on Monday imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying “celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases”.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel clarified that the direction would apply to all cities and towns in the country where the average of ambient air quality during November 2019 was in “poor” and above categories.“At other places, restrictions are optional for the authorities but if there are more stringent measures under orders of the authorities, the same will prevail,” the NGT had said.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had on Wednesday ordered the closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi-NCR till November 17 in view of a likely increase in pollution levels during the festive season.It also asked the governments of Punjab and Haryana to take immediate stringent actions to curb stubble burning and authorities in Delhi-NCR to strictly check biomass burning.

14-11-2020||Mumbai||'I've nothing to do with drugs'; NCB questions actor Arjun Rampal for 7 hours||Bollywood actor Arjun Rampal's troubles mounted as the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) grilled him for nearly 7 hours even as his Australian friend Paul Bartel was arrested in a drug related case investigation, official sources said here on Friday.Bartel was reportedly in regular contact with Agisialos Demetriades, an alleged drug peddler, arrested by NCB in Oct., and the brother of Gabriella Demetriades, the live-in partner of Rampal.An architect living in Bandra, Bartel was questioned by NCB on Thursday and early Friday placed under arrest in the same case in which Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty and at least 20 others have been arrested in the past three months of NCB probe.Since around noon, Rampal was grilled by the NCB, after his girlfriend Gabriella was questioned for more than 12 hours spread over Wednesday and Thursday, while Bartel was quizzed on Thursday and arrested this morning.Among other things, Rampal, 47, was interrogated on the nature of his links with Agisialos and Bartel, the seizures made during the raid conducted at his Bandra residence last Monday, and the role of Gabriella and others with drug peddlers.Interacting briefly with mediapersons after he exited the NCB office, Rampal said: "I am fully co-operating with the NCB investigations. I have nothing to do with drugs. The medicine found at my residence (in the Monday's raids) was prescribed by a doctor. The prescription has been handed over to the NCB.... The NCB officials are doing a good job and I fully support them in their investigations."Incidentally, Agisialos has been booked in another drug case after the probe revealed his connections with a Nigerian cocaine supplier, Omega Goodwin.Both Bartel and Agisialos are known to Rampal as well as other filmdom personalities as the NCB tightens it grip on the Bollywood-drugs mafia cartels.The NCB's Bollywood drugs angle probe was launched after the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput at his Bandra home five months ago—on June 14—in which several prominent personalities like Deepika Padukone, Shraddha Kapoor, Sara Ali Khan, Rakul Preet Singh, Firoz Nadiadwala and others have been either questioned, arrested or raided, and many others said to be on the agency's radar.

Hours later, team leader Nishchal Barot gave the final count as 6,06,569 ‘diyas’, saying it was “largest display of oil lamps” in the world.An organiser said about 8,000 volunteers, drawn from a local college and NGOs, were involved in the feat.The “Deepotsav” included the reenactment of the arrival of God Ram and Goddess Sita to Ayodhya on their ‘pushpak viman’, a laser and sound show and cultural programmes.Actors representing the deities of Ram, Sita and Lakshman descended in a helicopter.

14-11-2020||Patna||NDA legislature party meeting tomorrow to elect Bihar leader||A joint meeting of the NDA legislature party will be held here on Sunday where Nitish Kumar will be elected as its leader, it was decided on Friday.The decision was taken at an “informal” meeting of leaders of the four NDA constituents in Bihar — the JD(U), BJP, HAM and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) — at the residence of Kumar.BJP MP urges nitish to amend liquor ban policy “The meeting will start at 12.30 pm on Sunday, where all further decisions will be taken,” CM-elect Kumar, who also heads the JD(U), told mediapersons later.He also said the current state cabinet would hold its last meeting in the evening where a decision on the dissolution of the Assembly, the tenure of which expires on November 29, will be taken.“These formalities have to be completed before the formation of a new government. The cabinet’s recommendations will be forwarded to the Governor whose approval will be followed by other steps leading to the formation of a new government,” Kumar added.Despite the BJP emerging as the largest party in the ruling alliance with 74 seats, 31 more than the JD(U), the top leadership of the saffron party, including PM Narendra Modi, has emphatically endorsed Kumar as the next CM.He was declared the ruling coalition’s chief ministerial candidate much before the election process had started.Though Kumar did not divulge more on what transpired during the meeting at his residence, sources said the issues discussed included the representation of each constituent in the cabinet and election of the new Assembly Speaker.Nitish meets Guv, tenders resignationPatna: Decks were cleared on Friday for the formation of a new government in Bihar with Nitish Kumar, who is set to return as the Chief Minister, handing over to Governor Phagu Chauhan the resignation of his ministry and the recommendation to dissolve the state Assembly, officials said. The governor accepted the resignation and asked Kumar to continue as the caretaker CM till the new NDA government is sworn in.Speculation is rife that the BJP might push for an EBC or a Dalit as a Deputy CM though it is not clear whether the insistence will be on replacing veteran leader Sushil Kumar Modi, who has been holding the post for the most part since 2005, or replicating the experiment in adjoining Uttar Pradesh where two leaders occupy the post. One of the names doing the rounds for the Deputy CM’s post is that of Kameshwar Chaupal, a Dalit with deep roots in the Sangh who was famously chosen for laying the foundation stone at the Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya in the 1990s. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nda-legislature-party-meeting-tomorrow-to-elect-bihar-leader-170395

The world will be a safer place if we purge it of terrorism, which is the most virulent curse on humanity. The recent killings in European countries are reprehensible beyond words. It brings us to the point where we need to understand that terrorism in any form and manifestation needs to be stamped out through collective efforts of the international community,” said Kovind told senior functionaries, who attended the yearlong course.He said decision-makers must be guided by national interests as well as international objectives, both of which should be adaptive and multi-pronged.The NDC deals with several such challenges and offers course participants tools to understand the multi-dimensional geostrategic and geopolitical environment for future, said the President. The NDC is under the Ministry of Defence and the President is the Supreme Commander of the armed forces.“The NDC has imparted skills and knowledge to senior officers not only from our armed forces and civil services, but also those from friendly foreign countries,” said the President.Referring to the institution of ‘The President’s Chair of Excellence on National Security’ at the NDC few days ago, the President said it was a befitting gesture to mark the diamond jubilee of the college.
