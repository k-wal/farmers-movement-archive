12-11-2020||---||Only BJP can decide on LJP’s continuance in NDA: Nitish Kumar||Patna, November 12Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, whose JD(U) suffered a major slump in seats in the assembly polls on account of the rebellion by Chirag Paswan, on Thursday said it is for the alliance spearhead BJP to take a call on whether to retain the LJP in the NDA.Talking to reporters for the first time after the NDA’s victory, Kumar, who is set for yet another term in office, said the date for his swearing-in ceremony will be discussed at an “informal” meeting of all the four NDA constituents on Friday.“You make suggestions to this effect”, Kumar replied laughingly when asked whether he would ask the BJP to drop the LJP from the NDA at the Centre in the wake of its brinkmanship that scuppered the chances of JD(U) candidates in several seats.“In any case, it is for the BJP to decide. I have nothing to say in the matter,” said Kumar, who is the national president of the JD(U).The JD(U) has returned with a tally of 43 seats, down from 71 in 2015 when he contested assembly polls in alliance with the RJD and the Congress. In contrast, the BJP, which was hitherto a junior alliance partner, won 74 seats.The development will not put any hurdle in the way of Kumar’s return as the chief minister but will likely alter the power equations between the two parties.However, when asked whether he was apprehensive about being able to function as freely as earlier, Kumar replied in the negative.“I have always been uncompromising on the three Cs  crime, corruption and communalism. There is going to be no change. Not a single riot has taken place since I took over,” he said.“Janata maalik hai (the people are our lord). I have no personal feelings in these matters,” he said about the election reverses.About the possible date of swearing in, he said leaders of all the four NDA constituents will likely meet informally on Friday to discuss the issue.Kumar said since the tenure of the current assembly ends on November 29 there was time.He said if the swearing were to take place before November 29, the current assembly will have to be dissolved.“I will also need to tender my resignation before that for fresh oath-taking,” he said.He declined to comment on allegations by opposition leaders, including RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, that the process of counting of votes was rigged to help the NDA which got a slender majority and won by wafer-thin margins in several seats.“What do I have to say in such matters,” he replied dismissively.

At least 11 Lashkar-e-Taiba members are on the list for their involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks in India but not their masterminds.The FIA released a list of wanted men including MQM’s Altaf Hussain, Muhammad Anwar and Iftikhar Hussain besides several individuals from Al Qaeda, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, Sipah-e-Muhammad Pakistan, LeT, JeM and many others.However, it has claimed that most of the terrorists are overseas, including Iran, Syria, Afghanistan and the United Kingdom. Over half of the wanted men are from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, followed by 161 from Punjab, 122 from Balochistan and 100 from Sindh and the list also includes N-League member Nasir Mahmood, who recorded a video confession of former accountability court judge Arshad Malik included.“It is a fact that the 26/11 terror attack was planned, executed and launched from Pakistan’s territory.  Several other countries have also called upon Pakistan to expeditiously bring the perpetrators of the dastardly terror attacks to justice,” said Srivastava.He regretted that despite its own public acknowledgement as well as the availability of all necessary evidence, including that shared by India, Pakistan is yet to show sincerity in delivering justice to the families of 166 victims from 15 countries across the globe, a month before the twelfth anniversary of the Mumbai attacks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/names-of-mumbai-attack-masterminds-missing-from-pakistan-list-of-wanted-men-169783

12-11-2020||New Delhi||Our ideologies should not go against national interest, PM Modi tells JNU students||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday unveiled a statue of Swami Vivekananda on the JNU campus — for long an ideological battlefield for the Left and Hindutva groups — and asserted that people’s ideologies should be seen standing with and not against the country in matters of national interest.Giving priority to one’s ideology over national interest has harmed the democratic system of the country a lot, Modi said in his address to students after unveiling the statue through video-conferencing.“Everybody is proud of his ideology and this is natural. But our ideology should be seen standing with the nation and not against it in matters of national interest,” he said.He spoke of the independence struggle and the movement against the Emergency to note that people of different ideological persuasions had joined hands for national interest without compromising their ideologies to make his point.So when the question is about the national integrity and interests, then taking a decision under the burden of one’s ideology harms the nation, Modi said.“It is wrong to believe that one will think and act in a certain framework in matters of national interest solely because this is what one’s ideology says,” he said.Jawaharlal Nehru University has long been considered a citadel of the Left, with student unions affiliated to it calling the shots on the campus.The BJP and Hindutva groups, including the RSS’ student wing ABVP, have often claimed that groups with “anti-national” sentiments have found support from the Left-affiliated groups in the campus.There have been violent clashes between them at times in past.The decision to instal a life-size statue of Vivekananda, a widely-respected Hindu monk who the prime minister considers an idol, in the campus is imbued with rich symbolism.The statue, Modi expressed confidence, will teach people immense dedication to the nation and intense love for our country which, he added, is the prime message of Vivekananda’s life.The statue will inspire us to realise his dream of a strong and prosperous India, Modi said, noting that he had said at the start of 20th century that the next century will belong to India.Referring to the renowned university’s culture of debate and discussion of different ideas, he said they can now also do it in the statue’s shadow.In his address, Modi said good reforms were earlier considered bad politics but now it is good politics because his government’s intentions and commitment are pure, and it has prepared a “protection shield” for the poor and other vulnerable sections before carrying them out.People have endorsed our reform measures with their votes, he said, suggesting JNU students to undertake research on how reforms undertaken by his government have drawn popular support unlike earlier.In a swipe at earlier governments, he said the poor were given only slogans but efforts to include them in financial and other system were never made, and they remained “neglected, unconnected and financially excluded”.His government has provided them with houses, electricity, drinking water, digital banking, fast internet connection, Modi said, describing these measures protection shield for the poor which has given wings to their aspirations.The Prime Minister said the statue on the campus will inspire everyone and instil courage and compassion that Vivekananda wanted to see in everyone.“Swami Vivekanda wanted that education in the country should be such that it provides self-confidence to individuals and makes them ‘atmanirbhar’ in every way.“The new National Education Policy is on the same line and has inclusion at its core,” he added.India’s young population is its brand ambassador across the world, he said, adding that they are expected to be not merely be proud of its ancient identity but also to carve a new identity for the country in the 21st century.The statue’s unveiling by Modi drew protests from the JNU Students’ Union.‘Modi go back’, students flash postersStudents flashed posters of “Modi go back” and “we want answers” ahead of the unveiling of the statue by him.He has chosen this university for installing the statue but whenever students raise their voice on any issue, everybody comes “hounding” and demands that the university should be shut, said JNU Students' Union president Aishe Ghosh, who was leading the protest at the varsity’s north gate.N Sai Balaji, former JNUSU president and national president of Left-backed All India Students Association (AISA), asked, “Why is the PM not coming to inaugurate a hostel on the campus? Why is he not making a speech about students who have not got their scholarships? Our library has had an 80 per cent budget cut. Why is he not coming to announce that the funds will be sanctioned?”          Earlier in the day, the union had written an open letter to the Prime Minister saying they have profound disagreements with his idea India.

The EC had to hold four press conferences on counting day on November 10 to respond to various aspects of the process, Arora pointed out."We do not respond to comments made by political entities. It is their decision, what they said, why they said. The ultimate decision lies with people," he told reporters here.Responding to a query on the "slow pace of counting", Arora said keeping in mind the distancing norms in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of voters per polling station was restricted to 1,000 instead of the usual 1,500. This had resulted in an increase of 33,000 polling stations. This time, Bihar had over one lakh polling stations. More poling stations meant the use of 63 per cent additional electronic voting machines (EVMs).The number of counting tables per hall was also halved to seven instead of 14 and the number of counting locations also increased from 38 to 55.The counting of votes, which began at 8 am on November 10, continued till the wee hours of November 11.Arora, along with fellow election commissioners Sushil Chandra and Rajiv Kumar, paid tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat.He said the poll panel had paid tributes to Gandhi after the successful completion of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls."Today, the commission came to thank the Father of the Nation for the successful completion of the Bihar polls as they were held in the shadow of COVID-19," the CEC said.

However, Twitter has not yet corrected the map to show Leh as part of the Union Territory of Ladakh. It is still showing Leh as part of Jammu and Kashmir, which is against the official position of the Government of India.Last month, Twitter came under heavy criticism and faced backlash from social media users after its geotagging feature displayed “Jammu & Kashmir, People’s Republic of China” in a live broadcast from Leh’s Hall of Fame, a war memorial for fallen soldiers in Ladakh.This had triggered angry responses from netizens who demanded that stringent action be initiated against the micro-blogging platform.Meanwhile, an industry watcher said that in case Twitter does not fall in line even after the latest notice, possible options could include action initiated under Section 69A of the IT Act for banning access to Twitter in India.Also, under the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, the government can lodge an FIR, which has punishment of up to 6 months of imprisonment.

12-11-2020||New Delhi||Atmanirbhar Bharat 3 announcement headline management: Congress||Senior Congress leaders P Chidambaram and Jairam Ramesh on Thursday said the Centre’s Atmanirbhar 3 announcement today was an attempt to deflect attention from the fact that the Indian economy had entered technical recession.Former ministers P Chidambaram and Ramesh both accused the government of ignoring the starkness of the fact that the economy was in recession and working instead on headline management.“Atmanirbhar 3 which the finance minister announced today is an attempt at headline management and an attempt to bury the stark fact that the economy is in recession. For the first time we are witnessing the loss in GDP itself and not a loss in GDP growth rate. The government has come up with this Diwali Dhamaka to try and hide a hard fact. This is not going to help,” said Ramesh.Chidambaram noted that while the Indian economy was in dire situation, the government was “trying to deflect by talking of other things”.“The government is busy managing headlines when the economy is in recession. It has no considered plan to revive the economy. Year 2020 was a wasted year and we will end up with the size of the economy which is smaller than before,” Chidambaram said adding that liquidity is not the problem of the economy.“The problem is not liquidity. The issue is money must flow into the hands of the people and it’s not flowing. There is no revival of demand. The government must address people’s capacity to spend. That’s not happening,” said former finance minister Chidambaram suggesting four solutions for economic revival — ensuring remunerative prices for farmers; putting money in the hands of the poor; helping states with finances and creating jobs in the formal economy.Ramesh said the financial condition of states was deteriorating by the day and economy could not look up unless the condition of states improved.Ramesh said the economy had begun shrinking before the pandemic and the outbreak only exacerbated the situation.He said only time will tell whether the finance minister’s announcements today would yield any concrete results.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/atmanirbhar-bharat-3-announcement-headline-management-congress-169762
12-11-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC orders jailed poet-activist Varavara Rao’s examination by doctors of private hospital||The Bombay High Court on Thursday directed that doctors from a private hospital here should conduct medical examination of the jailed poet-activist Varavara Rao through video link, and even a physical check-up if necessary.The court, which was hearing his bail petition, adjourned the hearing to November 17.Rao, 81, an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, is lodged as an undertrial in the Taloja prison in neighbouring Navi Mumbai.A vacation bench of Justices A K Menon and S P Tavade was hearing a petition filed by Rao’s wife Hemlata, seeking that he be shifted to the private Nanavati Hospital for better treatment, an independent medical board be set up to assess his health, and he be released on bail.Rao’s lawyer Indira Jaising claimed that his health was “fast deteriorating”, and there was a legitimate apprehension that he might die in prison.Rao suffers from dementia, is confined to bed in the prison hospital since August and has no bladder control, she said.If Rao died in prison, it would be a case of “custodial death”, advocate Jaising said, adding that his detention violated his right to life under Article 21.Since his arrest in June 2018, Rao has been in and out of the government-run JJ hospital in the city. On July 16, he tested positive for coronavirus, after  which he was shifted to the Nanavati hospital. He was discharged on July 30 and sent back to the Taloja prison, she said.“He suffers from dementia, he is in diapers. Is this man going to flee away from justice?” advocate Jaising asked.In prison hospital, two co-accused, who are not medical professionals, were deputed to take care of him, the lawyer alleged.To this, the bench suggested that a team of doctors from Nanavati Hospital, who had examined him in July, may conduct a video medical examination.If the doctors felt that a video examination was inadequate, they could use their discretion to conduct a physical examination, the judges further said.“Taloja is not far. It will be open to the Nanvati hospital to send a team of doctors to the Taloja prison for a physical examination,” the bench said.The report of video examination be submitted at the earliest and if the doctors conducted a physical examination, its report should be submitted by November 16, the HC said.The National Investigation Agency, which is probing the case, opposed the proposal to shift Rao to Nanavati Hospital or to have his physical examination by its doctors.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, representing the NIA, said that Rao had previously been treated at the government-run JJ hospital and St George hospital in the city.If the plea was allowed then every prisoner would demand to be sent to the Nanavati hospital (or other private facility), setting a wrong precedent, he said.“Also, we should not underestimate our government hospitals. Recently, a former CM of the state sought treatment at St George Hospital,” Singh said.The court, however, said it did not see any harm in a video medical examination by the doctors of Nanavati hospital.The Maharashtra government’s lawyer Deepak Thakre submitted a report of Rao’s medical examination, conducted by the Taloja prison authorities on November 2.The urine culture report showed his readings were “normal”, Thakre said, adding that the prison authorities had consulted Nanavati hospital over phone, and were advised to conduct a complete blood count test for Rao.Jaising said the urine report did not reflect Rao’s declining neurological condition. The HC too noted that a mere telephonic consultation may not be adequate.Video examination by the Nanavati doctors was the “best solution in the interest of the accused”, the court said.Rao has been booked by the NIA under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

The creation of national awards by the Ministry is a step in this direction.He underlined the importance of making India a water-sufficient country. The importance of water was hallowed in Indian scriptures too while making a reference to Rig Veda and Atharva Veda, he added.Dwelling on the issue, he said water management was all the more important in the face of a growing population in the country.Developmental demands, human needs and the importance to the maintenance of the sanctity of the finite resources is a challenge which must be addressed headlong.He added that as per the vision of the Prime Minister, the Jal Shakti Ministry was created by incorporating water-related activities and verticals of other Union Ministries and departments for management of the resource in a holistic way.“The government is committed to provide potable water to every rural household through tap connection by 2024 under the Jal Jeevan Mission,” Kataria said. “The Mission is being implemented at a fast pace in the states,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/water-resources-lifeline-of-countrys%C2%A0progress-union-minister-kataria-169751
12-11-2020||New Delhi||Bihar poll win not endorsement of Modi govt’s handling of COVID-19: Yechury||Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for linking the Bihar poll victory to his government’s handling of the pandemic and the economy, the CPI(M) Thursday said the NDA had managed to get only 0.03 per cent more votes than the Mahagathbandhan, of which the Left parties were a part.In the recently concluded Bihar polls, the Left parties—CPI, CPIM and CPI(ML) -- bagged 16 of the 29 seats they fought.“PM Modi has bombastically claimed an endorsement of his govt’s handling of the pandemic & the economy. In terms of the vote share between BJP & allies and Mahagathbandan is a mere 0.03%; 12,768 more votes out of 3.14 crore voters.This is the truth,” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said in a tweet.Modi in his address at the BJP headquarters on Wednesday said that his government has undertaken several reforms and launched development as well as welfare initiatives for the people during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many big countries had also got bogged down by the virus spread.He also said that the BJP’s model of “good governance” was visible during the pandemic and asserted that people’s vote for the party has shown their support to the measures taken by his government.“Every single speech of Modi in Bihar was aimed at sharpening communal polarisation. No reference to the people’s miseries due to his pandemic mishandling & lockdown. Now claiming people’s endorsement! Deceitful propaganda & spin shall not work,” Yechury tweeted late Wednesday night.Accusing the government of looting the country’s assets, Yechury blamed the policies of the BJP-led Centre for the present state of the economy.The RBI has estimated that the economy will contract by 9.5 per cent for the full fiscal year.“Now it is official. The continuous contraction of the GDP is destroying lives, livelihoods, pushing crores of our people into  poverty, hunger and deprivation.Destruction of our economy by Modi’s policies is collosal.“Stop looting national assets, amassing fortunes in PM’s private funds.Substantially hike public investments, build infrastructure, generate jobs to boost domestic demand to kick-start economic revival,” he said.

Surprisingly, the Striped Bubble-nest frog is found to be common in wayside areas of North and Middle Andaman Islands,” according to the study published in the current issue of Zootaxa, an international journal of animal systematics.The scientific article titled “New insights on the systematics and reproductive behaviour in tree frogs of the genus Feihyla”, with the description of a new related genus from Asia (Anura, Rhacophoridae) said new findings such as this frog indicate that the amphibian inventory of the region is still far from being complete.Welcome Rohanixalus – a unique new genus of tree frogs, just described by a team of Indian-Indonesian-Chinese-Thai researchers. #Andaman #Frog #treefrog #UniversityofDelhi #northeastIndia #Zootaxa pic.twitter.com/1lfNSjM788  In a statement, Biju said the discovery of a treefrog member from the Andaman Islands was unexpected and once again highlights the importance of dedicated faunal surveys and explorations for proper documentation of biodiversity in a megadiverse country like India.“This finding also uncovers an interesting new distribution pattern of tree frogs that provides evidence for faunal exchange between the Andamans and the Indo-Burma region,” Biju said.Researchers have said they studied multiple aspects, such as the external morphology of adults and tadpoles, phylogeny, calls, and breeding biology of several treefrog species widely distributed across South, Southeast, and East Asia and confirmed that they represent a new genus.Frogs of this genus are known to inhabit forested as well as human-dominated landscapes right from Northeast India, Andaman Islands, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, up to southern China.Rohanixalus is the 20th recognised genus of the family Rhacophoridae and currently comprises eight out of the 422 known Old World tree frog species found in Asia and Africa, they said.Frogs of the new genus are characterised by a rather small and slender body (size about 2 to 3 cm long), a pair of contrastingly coloured lateral lines on either side of the body, minute brown speckles scattered throughout the upper body surfaces, light green coloured eggs laid in arboreal bubble-nests, and several unique behavioural traits including maternal egg attendance.“Based on DNA studies, the new genus is also revealed to be a distinct evolutionary lineage from all previously known tree frog genera. During the breeding season, these tiny reddish-brown frogs can be found in large aggregations on bushes and shrubs (about 1 to 4 metres high) surrounding water bodies,” the statement said.Scientists believe that many more unnamed Rohanixalus species are likely to be present and future dedicated efforts are required to fully understand the existing species diversity in this new genus.According to the study, the female (mother) attends the egg clutches until hatching and assists in the release of the tadpoles into the water.“During the first three days after egg laying the female sits over the eggs and produces a gelatinous secretion with which she glazes the egg mass through the clock-wise movement of her legs.This behaviour provides necessary moisture to the eggs laid on exposed leaf surfaces and protects them from insect predation,” it said.During field studies in Andamans, the researchers found a large number of egg clutches (over 50) of different developmental stages on a single leaf or plant. Multiple females usually attend such clutches in a behaviour termed as community egg attendance, they said.Frogs of the new genus have a unique nesting behaviour and are reported to display territorial behaviour and frequent male-male combats involving pushing, kicking, and dislodging, in order to successfully mate with a female.

In the last few years, we have come close to all these areas,’’ observed the PM while referring to the many similarities between India’s ‘Indo Pacific Oceans Initiative’ and ASEAN’s ‘Outlook on Indo Pacific’.The interaction, however, took place against the development of the ASEAN group planning to ink a regional free trade agreement with five countries on Sunday without waiting for India. While setting up the India-ASEAN summit, New Delhi had suggested that the two sides could commence negotiations. However the reaction from ASEAN was lukewarm.PM Modi tackled this irritant in the relationship by calling for an early review of the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA).Though the summit took place amidst China’s aggressive behaviour in the South China Sea and along the LAC, ASEAN members are split over categorising Beijing as an adversary.Ties between India and ASEAN have been on an upswing in the last few years, with focus being on ramping up cooperation in the areas of trade and investment as well as security and defence.The ASEAN leaders spoke of India as a long-term friend and welcomed its support to ASEAN centrality. India’s capacity building initiatives, including the PhD Fellowship Programme at IITs and setting up of Centres for Excellence in Software Development and Training in CLMV (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam) countries were appreciated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/enhancing-connectivity-with-asean-a-major-priority-for-india-pm-modi-at-virtual-summit-169744
12-11-2020||New Delhi||Free from confinement, a happy Diwali for elephant Sunder||This Diwali is the happiest one for Sunder, a rescued male elephant, after a span of seven-years of his solitary confinement and routinely abused life at a temple in Kolhapur, a city on the banks of the Panchaganga river in Maharashtra.Sunder’s life wasn’t so joyful before 2014. He lost his joyful free life in 2007 when he was given as a gift to the temple in Kolhapur as a very young elephant.When PETA India learned about Sunder’s plight, he had an injured eye, a hole in his ear, and scars all over his body from the cruelty he had endured.Following appeals from hundreds of thousands of PETA India supporters—including iconic singer Paul McCartney, actress Pamela Anderson, and acting legend Amitabh Bachchan—the Supreme Court ruled in favour of PETA India, and in 2014, Sunder was moved to his new home at the Bannerghatta Biological Park, where he can walk free, swim, and socialise with other elephants.“Sunder’s rescue from chains and beatings is one which we hope will lead to freedom for more captive elephants used in circuses, for rides, and in other ways, who are still suffering,” says PETA India CEO Dr Manilal Valliyate.“Now 21 years old, Sunder is thriving in his new home, where the rest of his life will be as sweet as this treat.”“It’s our privilege to have Sunder as part of our Bannerghatta Biological Park family. He is truly a gentle giant who loves the company of other elephants as well as his keepers,” says Vanashree Vipin Singh, IFS, chief conservator of forests and executive director of Bannerghatta Biological Park.“He has gradually habituated to his life here in Bannerghatta and we will continue to give him all the care and love. Special thanks to all his well-wishers from all over the world and PETA for bringing light into Sunder’s life as well as for their continuous support and love.”PETA India’s motto reads, in part, that “animals are not ours to use for entertainment”, and the group opposes a human-supremacist world view.

12-11-2020||Lucknow||Akhilesh alleges irregularities in Bihar polls||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday alleged irregularities in the Bihar Assembly polls and claimed that the opposition Grand Alliance was poised to win the election but "could not do so at the last moment". "We wanted to talk about the irregularities done with us (in Uttar Pradesh), but a more serious one has happened in Bihar. Tejashwi Yadav was poised to make his government but could not do so at the last moment. All those who have faith in democratic values are unhappy today and asking if this is how elections will be fought," he told reporters here.Yadav claimed that with only 14,000 more votes, the opposition alliance would  have emerged as victorious in Bihar. "The Bihar election was more nail-biting than the US (presidential) polls. I do not know which trick the BJP used. This is the speciality of the BJP," the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said.He said elections today have become mathematics."The BJP uses everything to win elections. I can give an example and also play a video to prove as to how all the officials, from the DM to police, were involved (in Uttar Pradesh). At some places, even during the checking of the body temperature while the voters were going in to cast their votes, they were threatened that such a temperature would be shown which would directly shift them to a hospital and ambulances were also deployed," Yadav said.He asserted that the SP would not leave the path of development come what may and claimed that the party's schemes were being repackaged by the current BJP-led government."I can say it on record that we had given farmers and women pension. Maximum bank accounts and bank branches were opened during the SP regime and online transfer of money had also started, but this government only indulges in publicity and we will also do the same now," Yadav said.He also hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh for its claims of giving 50 lakh jobs, asking it to name the departments where these jobs were provided. He also asked what happened to the claims of investments worth over Rs four lakh crore in the state, as claimed by the government."When the time comes, we will bring a scheme and spell out the details of where we will be giving jobs to youngsters," the SP president said.At least three farmers of Ayodhya also spoke at the press conference and recounted their problems at the hands of officials over land acquisition in their villages for the Sri Ram Airport and development of Ayodhya.They alleged that the officials were harassing them for signing the agreement under which their land is being acquired at very low rates. They also said they met Chief Minister Adityanath over the issue, after which the atrocities of the officials went up.Assuring all possible help from his party to the farmers of Dharampur, Ganja and Kutia gram sabhas who recounted their problems, Yadav said the government is taking land for a pious work and needs to show a big heart and revise the circle rate as there is never any dearth of money for it to serve people.He said the compensation amount for the farmers of these villages should be six times more than what they are being offered.Citing the example of the Agra-Lucknow expressway, the SP leader said the land for it was acquired after giving compensation to the satisfaction of the farmers.

He tweeted that honour had left the building (Supreme Court) long back and it was “the most supreme joke of the country”. He also made nasty comments about a sitting Supreme Court judge.“All this in my opinion constitutes contempt of court,” the Attorney General said.“This is a gross insinuation against the entirety of the Supreme Court that it is not an independent and impartial institution and so too its judges, but on the other hand is a court of the ruling party, the BJP, existing only for BJP’s benefit”, Venugopal noted.“I find that today people believe that they can boldly and brazenly condemn the Supreme Court of India and its judges by exercising what they believe is their freedom of speech. But under the Constitution, freedom of speech is subject to the law of contempt and i believe that it is time that people understand that attacking the Supreme Court of India unjustifiedly and brazenly will attract punishment under Contempt of Courts Act,” the Attorney General said.Several persons, including lawyers and law students, had written letters to Venugopal seeking his consent for initiating contempt of court proceedings against Kamra.One of them—Shrirang Katneshwarkar of Aurangabad—had written to Venugopal seeking his consent under Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, to initiate contempt proceedings against Kamra for his tweets allegedly scandalising the Supreme Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/attorney-general-venugopal-gives-consent-to-initiate-contempt-proceedings-against-kunal-kamra-169728

12-11-2020||Indore||HC declines to quash FIR against Ekta Kapoor for ‘obscene scene’ in her web series 'XXX-2'||The Madhya Pradesh High Court bench here has dismissed a petition of TV producer Ekta Kapoor seeking that a case filed against her for alleged objectionable content in web series "XXX season 2" be quashed.However, the Indore bench, in its 65-page verdict delivered on Wednesday, observed that the provision of the IPC section dealing with hurting religious feelings was not found to have been breached by the defendant.Five months ago, an FIR was registered against Kapoor following a complaint alleging that the web series, aired on her OTT platform ALTBalaji, not only spreads obscenity but also hurts religious feelings.The TV producer-cum-filmmaker was booked under relevant sections of the Information Technology Act and the IPC.A single bench of Justice Shailendra Shukla observed, "After due consideration in view of the aforesaid discussions, it appears that facts of the case are not such that this court may exercise its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of CrPC for quashing the FIR at least in respect of Section 67, 67-A of IT Act and Section 294 of IPC.""Although it would be fair enough to state that provision of Section 298 of the IPC and the provision of the State Emblem Act are not found to have been breached, Judge Shukla said in a reprieve to the producer on two charges.Kapoor was charged under IPC sections 294 (obscenity), 298 (hurting religious feelings), and also relevant provisions of the IT Act and the State Emblem of India (Prohibition of Improper Use) Act.The FIR was registered against her at the Annapurna police station here on the complaint lodged by Valmik Sakaragaye and Neeraj Yagnik, residents of Indore.

12-11-2020||Patna||Manjhi elected HAM legislature party leader, says won't accept ministerial berth||Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi was on Thursday elected the leader of its four-member legislature party.All the four newly elected MLAs met at Manjhi's residence where they elected the former chief minister the leader of the legislature group.They were all felicitated by pary leaders and workers present there following the party's best-ever peerformance in an assembly election. Manjhi was the lone HAM MLA in the outgoing assembly.Later, talking to reporters Manjhi advised the newly elected lawmakers of the Congress to join the NDA for the progress of the state."Nitish Kumar's development plans are not much different from those of the Congress. Moreover, he has kept away from many issues that are not in the interest of the state. So, you can join us in the NDA and contribute to the development of the state," Manjhi said.He was apparently hinting at Kumar distancing himself from contentious issues like Ram temple in Ayodhya and instant triple talaq.Manjhi had started his political career with the Congress in 1980. He later shifted to the RJD and then to JD (U). He quit the JD(U) after he was forced to step down to pave the way for the return of Nitish Kumar as the chief minister and later formed the Hindustani Awam Morcha.Kumar had stepped down as the chief minister in 2014 after taking moral responsibility for JD(U)'s abysmal performance in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, when only two of its candidates won, and installed Manjhi as the CM. When Kumar wanted the chair back, a defiant Manjhi initially refused but gave in to pressure.Kumar facilitated his return to the NDA just before the assembly elections to counterbalance another Dalit leader Chirag Paswan, who walked out of the ruling alliance in Bihar and went to the hustings alone.Manjhi's party was given seven seats to contest from the JD(U)'s quota of 122, and the party did well winning four.He HAM leader said he will not become a minister in the new government headed by Nitish Kumar after having been the chief minister.

12-11-2020||New Delhi||Western disturbance likely to improve Delhi’s air quality post Diwali||A fresh western disturbance is likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in Delhi-NCR post Diwali, according to the India Meteorological Department.Light rain is likely on Sunday under the influence of a western disturbance. It is still to be seen if it is enough to wash away pollutants, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre said.“However, Delhi-NCR’s air quality is likely to improve post Diwali due to an increase in wind speed. On Sunday, the maximum wind speed is expected to be around 12 to 15 kilometers per hour,” he said.VK Soni, the head of the IMD’s environment research centre, said calm winds and firecrackers emissions may push the air quality to the “severe” zone on Diwali night.The wind speed was expected to pick up thereafter and the wind direction will be east-southeasterly, he said.There would be a significant improvement in air quality by November 16, Soni said.The IMD said the western disturbance will trigger “scattered to fairly widespread” precipitation over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh; and isolated rainfall over Uttarakhand and the plains of northwest India on November 15 and 16.The minimum temperature is expected to increase in northwest India by two to three degrees Celsius in the next few days.The mercury will dip after the western disturbance withdraws from the region.

12-11-2020||New Delhi||BrahMos to be exported to third countries starting with Philippines: Russian DCM||India and Russia are planning to export the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile to the Philippines and several other countries, Russian Deputy Chief of Mission Roman Babushkin said on Thursday.The BrahMos missile is produced by an Indo-Russian joint venture and it can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft or from land platforms.People familiar with the talks on the export of the missile said India was likely to ink an agreement with the Philippines early next year to supply a batch of BrahMos to the Southeast Asian country.In the last few weeks, several tests of the new version of the missile were carried out in multiple locations. The range of the new version of the missile has been extended to 400 km from the original 290 km.However, its speed has been maintained at Mach 2.8, which is nearly three times that of sound.“All tests of contemporary versions are successful. They were carried out mainly to increase the range of this exclusive missile. We are exporting it to third countries, beginning with the Philippines,” Babushkin said at an online media briefing.It is learnt that India has held preliminary rounds of talks with the Philippines for the supply of the missile.On October 18, a naval version of the BrahMos missile was successfully test-fired from an indigenously-built stealth destroyer of the Indian Navy in the Arabian sea.Days later, the Indian Air Force test-fired an air-launched version of the BrahMos missile from a Sukhoi fighter aircraft in the Bay of Bengal.A number of countries including in the Gulf region showed interests in procuring the missile.India has already deployed a sizeable number of the original BrahMos missiles and other key assets in several strategic locations along the de-facto border with China in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh.The IAF is also integrating the Brahmos supersonic cruise missile on over 40 Sukhoi fighter jets, which are aimed at bolstering overall combat capability of the force.

12-11-2020||New Delhi||Herd immunity may come before Covid vaccine goes off the shelf: AIIMS Director||AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria in an interview to IANS said we may reach a stage down the line where we may have a good amount of immunity, and the people may feel that there is now good immunity and the utility of the vaccine is not there. He added, if the virus doesn't mutate or does not cause changes then people may not think to again vaccinate themselves and then, there will be less utilisation of vaccine down the line.Excerpts from the interview:Q: If a vaccine is available off the shelf by beginning of 2022 or end of 2021 for common people, wouldn't they have attained immunity against this viral infection, or maybe Covid-19 scenario improved by then. People may treat this viral infection like common cold and cough, which does not have an adverse health impact?A: There are two issues: One is immediate availability of vaccine to decrease and prevent the pandemic. So if a vaccine is available, if you are able to give it to the high risk group and those who have a higher chance of the infection as a priority, we would be immediately able to decrease the number of cases and also decrease the number of deaths.But, we may reach a stage down the line where we may have a good amount of immunity and the people feel there is now good immunity, the utility of the vaccine is not there. And, if the virus doesn't mutate or does not cause changes that may need you to again vaccinate yourself, because you may get re-infection, then there will be less utilization of the vaccine down the line. One issue is how the virus changes and what is the chance of reinfection and if that is a big issue, then should we get ourselves vaccinated to prevent the reinfection. We are learning how the virus behaves over the next few months and based on that there will be a decision on how frequently the vaccine is required. If we have good herd immunity whether it is required or not, this is a big challenge because a lot of money gets invested in vaccine doses and manufacturing and sometimes the vaccine industry is very concerned that they may have a drop in the demand.     Q:  You have mentioned about people having long-term side effects post their recovery from Covid-19 disease? If Covid-19 is from the coronavirus family, then why do patients develop medical complications that may have lasting health effects or prolonged illness?A: Most of the previous viral infection we had, has been due to other viruses like influenza. Coronavirus, we have almost seven other viruses in subsets in this coronavirus family. Four of them just cause flu-like symptoms, which are very mild. The other three we have, one was SARS, which was controlled and did not lead into a pandemic. We also have MERS coronavirus, which is not that infectious, so we have small outbreaks.This is the first pandemic of this magnitude with coronavirus, the previous pandemic was with influenza virus. What we are realising with this coronavirus, which is a new virus, and is of the bat origin. This virus, although causes respiratory tract infection, but it does also cause a systemic effect. The virus attaches to receptors which are present in many organs in the body, the ACE2 receptor. It causes swelling of the blood vessels and if these blood vessels are in the heart, then it may cause myocardial damage to the muscles of the heart. It leads to higher chances of clotting and this leads to strokes. This virus can cause what we call long-Covid. Post Covid squeal, which is not anticipated to be a serious problem, as most viral infections tend to recover and people have post-viral effects lasting for a few days then they become alright. The government is working aggressively on developing post-Covid-19 clinics at all levels, this could be at district level and in medical colleges, and to provide holistic support to these individuals. Many of them need supportive treatment, which could also be meditation, yoga, so it is looking at a comprehensive plan: allopathic, yoga and ayurvedic medicines.Q: There is data to show that BCG protects against viral infections. Can a booster dose boost the immune system and protect people against Covid-19? A: There is controversial data as far as BCG is concerned. There is in-vitro data from labs, which suggests BCG vaccination does give some degree of immune response, which has an anti-viral effect also. One retrospective study from Israel did not show any benefit to people who had the BCG vaccine. But there is another study from Netherland, which looked at people who are given the BCG vaccine five years ago for some other trial, and they found they had some degree of protection, as far as Covid-19 was concerned. The recent trial being done under the ICMR does tend to show there may be some benefit, but currently some vaccinated in the older age group are small. There are two trials going on in India, which are multi-centric: one is the BCG vaccine in elderly and the other is the BCG vaccine in younger age groups with co-morbidities. Theoretically, it may be more beneficial, but we need more data, to say it is worthwhile to vaccinate all the elderly with BCG booster dose. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/herd-immunity-may-come-before-covid-vaccine-goes-off-the-shelf-aiims-director-169704
12-11-2020||Patna||Tejashwi elected Grand Alliance legislature party leader, claims NDA won by deceit||RJD's Tejashwi Yadav was on Thursday elected the leader of the Grand Alliance legislature party and promptly hit out at the NDA, claiming it won the assembly elections through "deceit".Addressing a press conference, Yadav mocked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, whose JD(U) has been relegated to the third position in terms of seat tally, and wondered whether the latter would "heed his conscience and give up his attachment to the chair".He was obviously referring to Kumar resigning and snapping ties with the Grand Alliance before returning to the NDA fold in 2017 after Tejashwi's name had cropped up in a money laundering case. Kumar had then said he was stepping down after heeding his conscience (atma ki awaaz).Bihar and bypolls signal to Rahul as Congress loses bargaining powerYadav claimed the people's mandate was for a change but it was manipulated."It was undoubtedly a mandate for change. The NDA won by dhan, bal and chhal (money, muscle power and deceit," he alleged.Asked whether the Mahagathbandhan would try to muster numbers to form its own government, he said, "We will go to the people who gave the mandate. If they express such a wish we will act accordingly."Quoting election data, he claimed the NDA got only 12,270 votes more than the Mahagathbandhan."How can it convert into their victory in 15 more seats than us? We believe that had the counting of votes been fair, we would have returned with a tally of more than 130 seats," said Yadav, whose coalition has won 110 seats, 12 less than the magic figure of 122. The NDA clinched 125 seats.He said his alliance will write to the Election Commission and point out the "discrepancies"."In so many constituencies, postal ballots were counted in the end and not at the beginning of counting which is the norm. Moreover, there were seats where as many as 900 postal ballots were invalidated," the RJD leader alleged."We suspect this was done to offset the support we had received from a large number of servicemen who were moved by our commitment to one rank, one pension scheme. We demand recounting of postal ballots in all such constituencies and the process be videographed," Yadav asserted.The 31-year-old former deputy chief minister alleged that errant polling officials had acted like a "prakoshth" (cell) of the BJP, and replied in the affirmative when asked if legal remedy could be explored if the EC did not satisfactorily address the concerns.

12-11-2020||Patna||Nitish likely to take oath as new Bihar CM on November 16||Janata Dal-United leader and NDA ally Nitish Kumar is likely to take oath as the Bihar Chief Minister for another term on November 16 after the NDA victory in Assembly elections.In the results that came on November 10, the NDA that fought the elections under its chief ministerial candidate Nitish Kumar managed to bag 125 seats in the 243-member Assembly.Even as the NDA top leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has announced that Nitish Kumar will be the new CM, there is also a buzz that the new Cabinet will have two Deputy Chief Ministers from the BJP, similar to the arrangement in Uttar Pradesh.The role of Nitish Kumar is thus expected to undergo a change in the new government since his party has won only 43 seats, much lower than the BJP's 74 seats. As a result, the JD-U will play the role of 'younger brother' in the new Cabinet.The BJP cannot, however, afford to take a risk by putting pressure on Nitish Kumar for the Chief Minister's post since its top leadership knows that he has the option to switch sides.Nitish will also face the challenges to keep the NDA forces united as the alliance has just three seats more than a simple majority of 122 seats. In this case, the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) led by Jitan Ram Manjhi and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) has assumed the role of king-makers, despite their pre-poll alliance with the NDA.These two parties are likely to claim important portfolios in the bargain. The past history of these two parties will be beneficial for the JD-U and BJP in the new Bihar government.Nitish Kumar had given the CM post to Manjhi in 2014 in Bihar but when the JD-U leader asked Manjhi to step down, he refused and went over to the Mahagathbandhan.VIP leader Mukesh Sahani was also in the Mahagathbandhan or Grand Alliance of the opposition but demanded 25 Assembly seats to contest apart from the post of Deputy CM from the Rashtriya Janata Dal. When Tejashwi Yadav did not announce it in a press conference, he left the press conference midway and joined the NDA the very next day.As per the 2015 equation, every alliance partner of the NDA has bagged one portfolio in the ratio of 4 MLAs. Thus, the number of BJP Ministers will be higher compared with the JD-U in the new Cabinet. Moreover, HAM and VIP have won 4 seats each but are likely to claim at least 2 portfolios each due to their importance for the survival of the new government.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nitish-likely-to-take-oath-as-new-bihar-cm-on-november-16-169686

However, incumbent Trump is yet to concede defeat, vowing to mount legal fights in several key battleground states. There is much speculation on how the India-US relationship will shape during Biden's time in the White house.“Based on the priorities articulated already by President-elect Biden, I would anticipate that the Biden-Harris administration will continue to place a high priority on the defence and security relationship with India, the major area that has advanced during the Trump administration,” Alyssa Ayres Senior fellow for India, Pakistan, and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) told PTI.Author of 'Our Time Has Come: How India is Making Its Place in the World,' Ayres had served as deputy assistant secretary of state for South Asia from 2010 to 2013.Former vice president Biden was an early supporter of the US-India relationship, she said, adding that the president-elect, 15 years ago, viewed the US and India as "the two closest nations in the world".Biden had even championed the civil nuclear agreement with India in Congress, Ayres recalled.Biden's election campaign website speaks on partnering with India to support rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific region.Biden's global priorities on fighting the coronavirus pandemic and tackling climate change will necessitate close cooperation with India, Ayres said."I've seen a lot of attention in the Indian media to the question of whether President-elect Biden will criticise India on questions of democracy and human rights -- he has stated that he has concerns, and given his decades of diplomatic experience would be likely to convey his views privately -- but I've seen little on the question of climate change and clean energy," Ayres said in response to a question.Ayres expects clean energy and climate cooperation to return to the forefront of the agenda during the Biden administration as was the case during Barrack Obama's term.“We can see the catastrophic effects of climate change before us. Our country is on fire, and our coasts regularly hit by hurricanes, while India battles floods, drought, and extreme weather events; and we cannot solve this without dramatically scaling up clean energy,” she said.“India has emerged as a global leader in solar (power) and it will be in all of our collective interest to renew cooperation on this area (which) the Trump administration set aside,” Ayres said.Originally trained as a cultural historian, Ayres has carried out research in India-Pakistan geopolitics.Before serving in the Obama administration, Ayres was founding director of the India and South Asia practice at McLarty Associates, a Washington-based international strategic advisory firm, from 2008 to 2010.From 2007 to 2008, she served as special assistant to the undersecretary of state for political affairs as a CFR international affairs fellow.Prior to that she worked in the non-profit sector at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for the Advanced Study of India and at the Asia Society in New York.

12-11-2020||New Delhi||Bihar and bypolls signal to Rahul as Congress loses bargaining power||It was another day of anxiety for the Congress which emerged the top loser in Bihar elections and acutely underperformed in the 59-bypoll segment.Of the 129 seats, the grand old party contested in Bihar and across bypolls constituencies, it won only 28—losing 41 of the 59 byelections to the saffron party. The BJP by contrast contested 180 seats in Bihar and bypolls combined and wrested 115.With the Congress pulling down another ally in Bihar, the party’s bargaining power could well erode as it fails to carry its own weight.Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut on Thursday said the Congress dragged the RJD down in Bihar and Tejashwi Yadav could well have been chief minister had it not been for the Congress.While the Congress blamed election fraud, EVMs and the AIMIM-BSP combine for its drubbing in Bihar, the fact remains it failed to change the recent history of dragging down electoral partners across states.In Bihar, the Congress got 70 seats as part of the RJD-Congress-Left alliance and won 19.This was a significant drop from 2015 when the Congress had won 27 of the 41 seats it fought. The RJD emerged the single largest party in Bihar holding its ground while the Left posted stunning results winning 16 of the 29 seats it fought.With the Bihar no-show, the Congress would find it tough to strike hard political bargains with the Left in Bengal and the DMK in Tamil Nadu in the next election cycle.In Assam, too, the party would need to work overtime to find allies and redefine strategy especially after Asadudin Owaisi of the AIMIM demonstrated in Bihar that Muslim consolidation behind “secular forces” could be taken for granted.In Assam, the Congress has often banked on AIUDF’s Badrudin Ajmal for consolidation of minority support.Bihar results meanwhile hammer home Congress' past performance as an alliance partner in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.In the 2017 UP polls, the Congress fought on 105 seats in alliance with the Samajwadi Party and won only seven.Recently, in Maharashtra, the Congress contested 147 seats and won 44 in partnership with the NCP which fought on 121 segments and won 54.Although the Congress did well in Jharkhand where JMM was its ally, the party remained a junior partner there.Yesterday's results could also signal potential challenges for Rahul Gandhi who was the principal star campaigner for the Congress in Bihar and singularly crafted the party's anti-BJP offensive around COVID, the migrant crisis, joblessness and economic decline.Gandhi’s anti-Prime Minister Narendra Modi narrative did not resonate with the voters and this could mean the resurgence of latent rumblings within the Congress against the party’s first family.Already 23 leaders, who stirred the Gandhi pot recently by seeking reforms and elections to party posts, are waiting to make their next moves.Bihar and MP results could well provide them with fresh fodder.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-and-bypolls-signal-to-rahul-as-congress-loses-bargaining-power-169673

The collaboration will further aid us in putting India at the forefront of developing an immunogenic and efficacious vaccine," SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said.The partnership further testifies the importance of private-public institutes coming together in scaling up the management and containing the spread of the virus, he added. ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said the partnership is their contribution to lending expertise and support to bolster fight against the global pandemic.Based on the phase II/III trial results, SII with the help of ICMR will pursue the early availability of this product in the country.SII has already manufactured 40 million doses of the vaccine, under the at-risk manufacturing and stockpiling licence from Drugs Controller General of India.Covishield has been developed at the SII Pune laboratory with a master seed from Oxford University/Astra Zeneca. The vaccine made in the UK is currently being tested in large efficacy trials in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and the US. The promising results of the trials so far give confidence that Covishield could be a realistic solution to the pandemic. ICMR and SII have further collaborated for clinical development of another COVID-19 vaccine Covovax, which has been developed by Novavax, USA, and upscaled by SII.

12-11-2020||Mumbai||Navy's fifth Scorpene-class submarine Vagir launched||Navy’s fifth Scorpene-class submarine Vagir, having superior stealth features like the advanced acoustic absorption technique, was launched on Thursday at the Mazagon Dock in south Mumbai.Vijaya, wife of Minister of State for Defence Shripad Naik, launched the submarine through video-conferencing. The minister was the chief guest at the event and attended it via video link from Goa.Vagir is part of the six Kalvari-class submarines being built in India. The submarines, designed by French naval defence and energy company DCNS, are being built as part of the Navy’s Project-75.These submarines can undertake missions like anti-surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, mine laying, and area surveillance, an official said.Vagir is named after the Sand Fish, a deadly deep sea predator of the Indian Ocean. The first Vagir, a submarine from Russia, was commissioned into the Indian Navy on December 3, 1973, and was decommissioned on June 7, 2001 after almost three decades of service to the nation."Building the Scorpene was indeed a challenge for MDL, as the complexity of the simplest of tasks increased exponentially due to all work having to be done in the most congested of spaces," MDL said in a release."The state-of-art technology used in the submarine has ensured superior stealth features such as advanced acoustic absorption techniques, low radiated noise levels, and hydro-dynamically optimised shape and also the ability to attack the enemy using precision- guided weapons," the release said.The attack can be launched with both torpedoes and tube-launched anti-ship missiles, whilst underwater or on surface, MDL said. "The stealth of this potent platform is enhanced by the special attention to her characteristic underwater signatures. These stealth features give it an invulnerability, unmatched by most submarines," it said.The submarine is designed to operate in all theatres of operation, showcasing interoperability with other components of a Naval Task Force, MDL said."With the launching of Vagir, India further cements its position as a submarine building nation. This is in sync with the current impetus of the government towards Make in India and Atma Nirbhar Bharat," MDL said.Two submarines of the ongoing Project-75 Scorpene programme at MDL, Kalvari and Khanderi, have been commissioned into the Indian Navy. The third submarine, Karanj, is in the last phase of rigorous sea trials. The fourth Scorpene, Vela, has commenced her sea trials, whilst the sixth and last submarine, Vagsheer, is being readied for boot together."Two SSK submarines built by MDL during 1992-94 are in active service, which is a testimony to the professionalism and capability of Mazagon Dock personnel," it said.

Addressing party workers during the victory celebrations at the BJP office here, he said the NDA would work for the people of Bihar under his leadership.“Under the leadership of Nitish Kumar ji, we will leave no stone unturned to meet our commitment to the state’s development,” he said. Sources indicated that no major changes were expected n the power-sharing arrangement between the two allies, despite the saffron party emerging the bigger player in Bihar.

I want to tell them, don’t give me any ‘chetavni’ (warning).... In a democracy, bloodbath cannot win elections.”Thanking women voters in Bihar, he said the “silent nari shakti” had contributed to the NDA’s poll success.

That is the expectation we as common citizens and artistes have.Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and 13 other online platforms had signed up for a self-regulation code in September 2020, agreeing to develop a framework for content description, age classification and access control along with having a committee to address consumer complaints. Outspoken actor Swara Bhasker posted, “Chalo, goodbye good content!”Filmmaker Hansal Mehta observed: “ This desperation for control of free speech and expression does not augur well. I am very disappointed.” Filmmaker Rahul Mittra was of the opinion that just as news channels are regulated, not censored, the same could apply to OTT platforms and online news portals, “ but at the same time a filmmaker’s right to expression should not be comprised.”Filmmaker Madhureeta Anand said she was yet to decipher the regulations. “In any case any kind of censorship is detrimental,” she added.Actor Rishina Kandhari believes the OTTs and the ministry need to work together as “meaningful content will continue to create an impact, irrespective of the regulations.” Paritosh Tripathi, who will be seen in “Ludo” observed: “ Along with being an artist, I am also a citizen.

12-11-2020||Ajay Banerjee||India, China consider 3-step proposal to ease LAC standoff||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 11To ease tension in eastern Ladakh, a three-step disengagement plan has been suggested. India is considering a proposal by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) asking the Indian Army and its troops to pull back from critical spots along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).If an agreement is reached, India will vacate the 13 spots it occupies along the southern bank of Pangong Tso. In response, the PLA will pull back from the spots on the northern bank of the same lake. However, the contentious 900 sq km Depsang plains in northern Ladakh, where both sides have claims and counter-claims, is not part of the proposal or the suggested pullback.“It is a proposal, and not an agreement to disengage, let it be fine-tuned and matters to mature,” said a senior Indian Army officer.The China Study Group (CSG), led by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, will consider the proposal but is likely to seek iron cast guarantees that the perception of the LAC — an un-demarcated boundary — will be respected.Also, that the PLA troops will not reoccupy the heights India vacates south of Pangong Tso or those on the north bank or the points of disagreement at Galwan, or patrolling points 15 and 17.The CSG will be discussing that the issue of entire 826-km LAC in Ladakh should be part of the same disengagement and de-escalation process and must include the Depsang plains.It is here that the Chinese troops can threaten India’s access to the 255-km Darbuk-Shyok-DBO (DSDBO) road, which leads to Karakoram Pass and has an airfield next to it at an altitude of 16,800 feet.India will convey its decision at the ninth meeting of the senior military commanders anytime next week.More than 50,000 troops of each side face each other, accompanied by tanks, artillery guns, fighter jets and missiles, in the worst-ever border crisis since 1967 when both sides had exchanged fire.Apart from the fatal Galwan clash in June this year, there have been hand-to-hand combat and firing in the first week of September. The night temperature in the area is minus 30 degrees Celsius.How Delhi, Beijing plan to DisengagePhase 1: Simultaneous withdrawal of tanks from forward locations along the LACPhase 2: Simultaneous withdrawal of troops — Indian troops will return to the Dhan Singh Thapa post located on Finger 3 (see map), north of the Pangong TsoPhase 3 The Indian Army will withdraw from all 13 critical heights and territories, including Rezang La and Renchin La, along the southern bank of Pangong Lake which give India an edge over the Chinese troops||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-consider-3-step-proposal-to-ease-lac-standoff-169550

A probe by the vigilance cell of the MoD — dealing with the MES and the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) — was launched in 2016 after questions were raised in the matter. In October 2018, the progress in a series of cases was reviewed and the probe was intensified. It has now been found that the contractor was overpaid for the work he carried out.
