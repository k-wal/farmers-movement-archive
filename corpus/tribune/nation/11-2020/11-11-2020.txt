Sadanand Singh represented the seat eight times before deciding to hand over the baton to his son.In Chapra, senior RJD leader Prabhunath Singh’s son Randhir Kumar Singh was humbled by sitting MLA C N Gupta (BJP).JD(U)’s Nikhil Mandel, grandson of Mandal Commission report’s author B P Mandal, lost to experienced Chandrasekhar of the RJD on the Madhepura seat.Nikhil’s father Manindra Kumar Mandal had represented the seat twice on a JD(U) ticket, but he retreated in the background and gave chance to his son who could not make it to the assembly.Among other notable losers are—Chandrika Roy, son of former chief minister Daroga Prasad Rai, from Parsa. Roy, also the father Tej Pratap Yadav’s estranged wife Aishwarya, had switched over to the JD(U) from the RJD, but received drubbing at the hands of another turncoat Chhotelal Rai who moved to Lalu Prasad’s party leaving Nitish Kumar’s.A fight among two brothers took place in Jokihat seat in Araria district, where sons of former union minister Mohammad Taslimuddin were pitted against each other.Younger brother Mohammad Shahnawaz, who contested on Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM party, defeated his brother Sarfaraz Alam of the RJD by over 17,000 votes.Sadhu Yadav, the controversial brother-in-law of Lalu Prasad, who entered the fray on Mayawati’s BSP party lost to Subhas Singh of the BJP by over 36,000 votes in Gopalganj seat.Jayvardhan Yadav, grandson of former union minister Ramlakhan Singh Yadav, who had crossed over to the JD(U) from the RJD, got defeated by Sandeep Saurabh of CPI-ML in Paliganj seat.Hindustani Awam Morcha president Jitan Ram Manjhi won the Imamganj seat, but his son-in-law Devendra Kumar lost to RJD’s Satish Kumar on Makhdumpur seat. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dynasts-report-card-victory-for-lalus-sons-defeat-for-sharad-shatrughan-wards-169362
11-11-2020||Kolkata||Owaisi’s AIMIM to contest Bengal polls, TMC calls it BJP’s B team||With Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) announcing its decision to contest the 2021 assembly polls in West Bengal, the ruling TMC in the state Wednesday called it a “communal force which acts as the B team of BJP”.Buoyed by the results in the Bihar assembly polls, Owaisi had on Tuesday night announced that AIMIM would contest the polls in West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and other states but did not divulge details on an alliance with other parties.Asked about AIMIM’s detailed plans for West Bengal, which has nearly 30 per cent Muslim population, the party’s national spokesperson Asim Waqar told PTI on Wednesday that the party has already set up units in 22 out of the 23 districts of the state.“We will fight the assembly polls in Bengal. We are preparing our strategy for that. We have a good presence in 22 out of the 23 districts of the state. We think as a political party we can make deep inroads in the state,” Waqar said.Reacting to allegations of acting as “B team” of the BJP and being a “vote cutter”, Waqar termed it as “baseless” and “politically motivated”.“These allegations are baseless and a sign of desperation of the TMC. Mamata Didi and TMC have to decide whether they want to fight with us or against us,” he said.“We are ready to fight alone. We are a political party and we have every right to fight polls. No one can stop us from doing so,” Waqar, who also has been appointed as AIMIM in-charge of Bengal by Owaisi, added.Reacting to the development, the TMC termed the Owaisi-led party as a “communal force deputed by BJP” to act as “vote cutter” in the polls.“Just like BJP, the AIMIM is also a communal force.Both the political parties survive on divisive politics. The AIMIM is planning to fight elections in Bengal to help BJP in the state,” senior TMC leader and state minister Firhad Hakim said.“Let me make it very clear that they (AIMIM) will not be able to make an impact as the Muslims of the state stand by Mamata Banerjee in Bengal,” he said.BJP has often accused TMC of indulging in appeasing the minorities for the sake of vote bank politics.The minorities, who comprise nearly 30 per cent of the state’s electorate, are a deciding factor in almost 110 assembly seats spread across its various districts. They are a vote bank that every political party try to woo in Bengal.Since 2011 the minorities in Bengal have voted en bloc in favour of the Trinamool Congress giving an edge to Mamata Banerjee’s party.AIMIM, which bagged five seats in the Bihar polls, seems to have cut big time into the Mahagathbandhan vote share. It had fought in 20 seats in Bihar polls as part of the Grand Democratic Secular Front that has four other parties, including Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Samta Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/owaisis-aimim-to-contest-bengal-polls-tmc-calls-it-bjps-b-team-169361

11-11-2020||New Delhi||Directors and writers react to OTT platforms coming under I&B ministry||The government has decided to put OTT platforms as well as online news and current affairs content under the Information and Broadcasting ministry.Here are some reactions from writers and directors who have produced content for streaming platforms:Filmmaker Hansal Mehta, director of ‘Scam 1992': "While this decision wasn't unexpected it is still a reason for despair. This desperation for control of free speech and expression does not augur well. I am very disappointed.”Writer-director Reema Kagti, director of ‘Made in Heaven': "It puts Indian content creators at a disadvantage when they are competing on the world stage. I don't know what one can do...I don't know the legal ramifications of this. It is too premature to talk what can be done. We should wait and hope things will get clear when the guidelines or whatever is the intent comes into play.”  Alankrita Shrivastava, also a director on ‘Made in Heaven': “I believe there should be no censorship regardless of the medium. Films and series can be age certified and classified but a free and democratic country should let its adult citizens decide what they would like to watch or not watch in a theatre, or on their phones and computers. The choice must belong to the citizen."Karan Anshuman, showrunner-director on ‘Mirzapur': “The state has no business interfering in personal choices of viewers and creative expression of makers. It's really simple: educate people to turn off their device if they don't like what they see - they have a million other choices today.” Gurmeet Singh, also a director on ‘Mirzapur': "We hope no decision is taken that will hamper us in wanting to make any kind of creative content. It's too early to react to it. We can hope decisions are taken sensibly.”Nupur Asthana, one of the directors of ‘Four More Shots Please!': “I hope the ministry decides to not go forward with this and leave it to the audience what to watch and how to watch, they are mature enough. We should respect the audience for their judgement and maturity. There is a child lock system on OTT.” Danish Aslam, creator of the show ‘Flesh': If you don't want to see something because it offends you, please do not make the effort of downloading an app, going to the movie theatre and, on top of that, paying for all these activities.MX Player CEO Karan Bedi: "As responsible content creators, we want to ensure this act not only takes cognisance of the nature of content being released, but also ensures that we safeguard creativity in this rapidly growing sector.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/directors-and-writers-react-to-ott-platforms-coming-under-ib-ministry-169350
11-11-2020||Mathura||Priests’ body, social organisation move court against plea for removal of Mathura mosque||A body of priests and a social organisation on Wednesday approached a district court against the plea seeking the removal of a mosque near a temple which the devouts believe marks the birthplace of Lord Krishna. The Akhil Bharatiya Tirath Purohit Mahasabha and the Mathur Chaturved Parishad pleaded to be made respondents in the case.They said the suit for the removal of the mosque should not be allowed as it is detrimental to communal harmony in the country, according to their counsels.In September, a group of people had filed a suit over the 17th century Shahi Idgah mosque, which they claimed was built at the birthplace of Lord Krishna, within the 13.37-acre premises of the Katra Keshav Dev temple.The suit was filed on behalf of child deity Bhagwan Shri Krishna Virajman, through the “next friend” Ranjana Agnihotri and others.Next friend is a legal term for a person who represents someone directly unable to maintain a suit.The appellants had demanded the annulment of an earlier Mathura court ruling, ratifying a land deal reached between the Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan and the Shahi Idgah Management Committee.The petition had named the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf  Board, Shahi Masjid Idgah Trust, Shri Krishna Janambhoomi Trust, and Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan as defendants.Ramesh Kumar Sharma, the counsel for the priests’ body, said the organisation, represented by its national president Mahesh Pathak and vice-president Naveen Nagar, requested the court to make them respondents or at least hear them out in the case.Sharma said the organisation has stated in their plea that communal harmony of the country, especially Mathura, may be adversely affected if the appeal against the mosque is allowed.The Mathur Chaturved Parishad said in their application that the plaintiffs in the case are not residents of Mathura and are guided by some political people.For the sake of publicity, they want to spoil the peace of Mathura by presenting a concocted story, the application said.An environment of fear would develop and livelihood of priests and others would be in peril if the appeal is allowed, K K Arora, the counsel for the parishad said.Arora said the parishad requested the court to make them respondents to avoid an environment of enmity. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priests-body-social-organisation-move-court-against-plea-for-removal-of-mathura-mosque-169349
11-11-2020||Patna||NDA to form new govt in Bihar next week with Nitish back as CM||With the NDA getting a comfortable majority in the Bihar assembly, all eyes are now on the formation of the next government which will likely be sworn in soon after the Diwali festivities get over later this week, informed sources said here on Wednesday.They said JD(U) president Nitish Kumar will be back as the chief minister for yet another term in office.Kumar, who looks on course to becoming the longest serving chief minister of the state during his new term, was expected to take oath on or after Monday next week before which he will send his resignation to the governor since his current tenure expires at the end of November.The record is currently held by the state’s first chief minister Srikrishna Sinha who was in office for 17 years and 52 days. Kumar has so far helmed the state for 14 years and 82 days.Upon being administered the oath of office, Kumar will also hold the distinction of having been sworn in seven times as chief minister in two decades. He first took oath as chief minister in 2000 when the state threw up a hung assembly but resigned a few days later for want of adequate number of MLAs backing him.In 2005, he became the chief minister after the NDA secured a full majority, and returned to power five years later. In 2014, he stepped down owning moral responsibility for the JD(U)’s debacle in the Lok Sabha elections but returned as the CM less than a year later.In November 2015, the Grand Alliance comprising the JD(U), RJD and the Congress, which declared him as its chief ministerial candidate, won the assembly elections and Kumar was again sworn in. In July, 2017 he stepped down heeding his “inner voice” which had been tormenting him over his then deputy Tejashwi Yadav’s name cropping up in a money laundering case.Kumar was, however, sworn in again the very next day when he formed a new government with the BJP.The JD(U) chief is expected to get full backing of all constituents of the NDA, including the BJP, which has outperformed his party in the assembly elections.The BJP has returned with a tally of 74 while the JD (U) has only 143. In addition, the NDA in Bihar includes former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi’s HAM(S) and Bollywood technician-turned-politician Mukesh Sahni’s VIP which have won four seats each.Speculations about the BJP reneging on its promise of backing Kumar as the chief minister following its own impressive performance were put paid to at a late night press conference on Tuesday.At the press conference, convened around midnight when trends made it clear that the NDA will get a comfortable majority, the party’s national general secretary in-charge of the state Bhupendra Yadav, Bihar unit chief Sanjay Jaiswal, Union minister Nityanand Rai and Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi had reiterated that Kumar will be the chief minister again.They evidently had the backing of the party’s top leadership, of which Kumar himself dropped ample hints.“The people are our lord. I salute them for the support which enabled the NDA to get a majority. I am also thankful to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the cooperation I have been receiving,” Kumar tweeted in Hindi, on Wednesday evening. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nda-to-form-new-govt-in-bihar-next-week-with-nitish-back-as-cm-169344
11-11-2020||New Delhi||Bihar done, Narendra Modi sets his sights on Bengal||Ending all speculations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi again endorsed Janata Dal (United) supremo Nitish Kumar as NDA’s leader in Bihar on Wednesday.Taking a bow at a ‘dhanyawaad karyakram’ (thanksgiving celebrations) at the BJP headquarters, the PM said the NDA will work for people of Bihar under the leadership of Nitish Kumar. “Under the leadership of Nitish Kumarji we will leave no stone unturned to fulfil our commitment for development of the State,” he said, ending speculations whether Nitish Kumar, whose party under-performed in comparison to the BJP in the Bihar elections that are largely credited to PM Modi, had the ‘moral right’ to occupy the top spot.Meanwhile sources also indicated that “no major changes are expected in power sharing arrangement” between the two main NDA allies in Bihar despite the saffron party emerging the bigger player. The government forming process is expected to be initiated after Diwali. Addressing jubilant cadres the PM also set the tone for upcoming elections in West Bengal and Kerala, proving that the BJP is not called an ‘election machine’ for nothing.“Those who cannot challenge us are targeting our cadres… I want to tell all of them don’t give me ‘chetavni’(  warning) because that the people of India will do that. In a democracy bloodbath cannot win elections,” he said. He also thanked women voters, the ‘silent naari shakti’, who contributed to NDA’s success in Bihar.  “We have the backing of strong ‘silent’ voters…they are the country’s mothers, sisters and daughters…they have become the ‘naari shakti’ for the party which cares for their safety and respect,” he said.  While speaking about “trust that people have in the BJP” and attacking “dynasty politics” (but without naming any political party) the PM said “internal democracy has to be maintained which is one reason why I can say Nadda ji age bado hum tumhare saath hain (Naddaji(BJP president) move forward we are with you… The BJP is winning elections because the country’s blessings are with it… we have to fulfil the responsibilities”Crediting Bihar and by-polls to the BJP’s mantra of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas sabka vishwas, he said: “BJP is the only party on which people have faith… The results are symbol of party’s spread since the last Lok Sabha elections (2019)… From two MPs and two rooms, today BJP is the only party which is in every corner, every heart in the country. The results prove that if you work with honesty you will get blessings of people. The electorate is saying it again and again. Those who do not understand you know what happened to them… they have lost deposits.”As he congratulated cadres of BJP and NDA, the PM also thanked JP Nadda who received a standing ovation from top leaders on the stage, union ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari for his first major victories as the BJP president at the colourful ‘Diwali before Diwali’ blitzkrieg in the characteristic saffron style of pre-corona times.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-done-narendra-modi-sets-his-sights-on-bengal-169342

He was released from Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai late in the evening.Last week, an FIR was registered against Goswami, his wife and his son at NM Joshi Marg police station for allegedly assaulting a woman police officer when a police team went to his house to arrest him in the suicide case on November 4.Goswami and Samyabrata on Wednesday filed anticipatory bail pleas which are likely to be heard by additional sessions judge P B Jadhav on Thursday, court sources said.Advocate Shyam Kalyankar, their lawyer, said Goswami and his wife had only verbally protested his “illegal arrest” from his Lower Parel house here last Wednesday.“Neither Goswami nor his wife assaulted any police official. We are relying on several videos recorded in the morning of November 4 when the police barged into their house,” he said.Around 40 armed police personnel were present at the time of the alleged incident, the lawyer claimed, asking “who will deter a public servant (from doing his duty) in the presence of such a huge number”.“We were only protesting the illegal arrest,” Kalyankar said.Goswami and his wife were booked under IPC sections 353 (assault to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 504 (intentional insult to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and under the Damage to Public Property Act.The complainant in the case is 49-year-old police officer Sujata Tanvade, who alleged that Goswami, his wife and son assaulted her on that day. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arnab-seeks-pre-arrest-bail-in-case-of-assault-on-woman-cop-169341

People will donate as per their will and capacity,” CMDM top leader Swami Avdeshanand Giri said after the session.It lauded Union government’s plan to renovate dilapidated and shattered shrines and temples in Jammu and Kashmir after abolishing Articles 370 and 35A.It also hailed government for ringing in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.The CMDM urged the state governments to enact anti-conversion law with stringent provisions.“The law must have a provision of one-month gestation period to verify of the applicant wishing conversion was not during under duress.”The session condemned the recent shooting dead of a woman of Hindu faith by a person of different religion in broad daylight in Ballabgarh in Haryana on her allegedly spurning his marriage offer.It noted that incidents of “love jihad” inspired by religious terrorism, religious conversion activities, by Christian missionary and anti-national campaign by naxalites have intensified.The CMDM also decided to facilitate “ghar wapsi”- return of persons, who proselytised from Hinduism to other faiths, back to Hindu fold.Expressing concern at the killing of two seers in Palghar (Maharashtra) by crowd of anti-national elements in presence of policen in April, the CMDM attributed it to nexus between proactive Church (NGO) and political force.Flaying the Maharashtra government for allegedly trying to hush up the case, it demanded handing over the probe to the CBI.“The state government was trying to muzzle the voices raising the Palghar incident,” Giri said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vhp-calls-for-nationwide-campaign-to-raise-funds-for-ram-temple-169335
11-11-2020||New Delhi||India's decentralised but unified mechanism was behind COVID-19 unique response strategy: Health Minister||India's decentralised but unified mechanism to provide universal, accessible, equitable and affordable healthcare to one and all was the driving force behind the unique response strategy for COVID-19, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Wednesday.Addressing BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) Health Ministers Conference, he said India's COVID-19 response approach was preemptive, proactive and graded.Starting with early screening and isolation of passengers, imposing lockdowns and creating containment zones to prevent over-burdening of health facilities and personnel, propagating behaviour change as an integral move to contain the spread, and ultimately recognizing the imperative need for reopening of the economy in a phased, cautious and responsible manner, he said.Vardhan said while the Centre steered this movement with constant monitoring and evaluation, providing handholding support to the states to tackle this crisis holistically, respective state governments also undertook various unique strategies to keep their response mechanism agile and vigilant."Our decentralized but unified mechanism to provide universal, accessible, equitable and affordable healthcare to one and all was the driving force behind our unique response strategy for COVID-19," Vardhan said.He said India has curated its response, keeping in mind the large population size."Several technological innovations were also leveraged in our pandemic management efforts. While applications such as Arogya Setu and ITIHAS facilitate rapid contact tracing and surveillance, the interactive and dynamic COVID India Portal enabled real time tracking and monitoring," Vardhan added.The iGOT portal (Integrated Government Online Training) was also launched as a training module for our frontline health workers, he said."We worked round-the-clock to boost domestic production and expand our healthcare workforce, thus bridging major gaps in demand and supply of essentials such as testing kits, PPEs, ventilators etc. Furthermore, an Aatma Nirbhar Bharat movement has now been launched to become self-sufficient in all our capacities," Vardhan said.He underlined the need for an aggressive roadmap and a strong show of solidarity to curtail any present and future risks threatening safety and wellbeing of millions of global citizens."There is also an impending need to share reliable and accurate data and any lessons drawn in the course of managing this pandemic, to eliminate any threat of emerging disease outbreaks and ensuring equitable and inclusive access to healthcare for one and all," he said.

11-11-2020||New Delhi||Inequality continues to rise in India: Report||Inequality started to rise in India and China substantially in the early 1990s and 2000s, while it was stabilised in China, it continued to rise in India, according to a report.“In China, the top-1 per cent captured eight per cent of national income in 1990 and rose to 14 per cent in 2019, while in India, the corresponding figures are 11 per cent in 1990 and 21 per cent in 2019,” the World Inequality Lab said in the report.It said while inequality started to rise substantially in India and China in the early 1990s and 2000s, it was stabilised in China but continued to rise in India.The report added that this suggests that development and higher growth rates do not necessarily mean more inequality in the distribution of growth. “As a matter of fact, national economic policies matter.”       In both the countries, inequality increased substantially after the economic liberalisation of the 1980s and 1990s, it said.The report said communist countries like China and Vietnam display lower inequality levels than non-communist countries like India and Thailand. They still display much higher levels of inequality as compared to the Western Europe, the least unequal region worldwide, it added.China and Vietnam also appear to be more unequal than post-communist Eastern Europe but somewhat less unequal than post-communist Russia, it said.According to the report, in the bottom 50 per cent, the population share of India as well as other South Asian economies have been expanding and contrasting to the sharp decline of the Chinese population share in this group.The World Inequality Lab is the open source for global inequality data, both within countries and between countries.

The Hathras incident (in Uttar Pradesh) was unfortunate, but will Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi come and meet the victims’ family here like they went to Hathras?” Patil asked.“We will not do anything against the Constitution. Toppling this government is not our culture,” the BJP leader said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/thackeray-govt-would-not-last-full-term-maharashtra-bjp-president-169323

Earlier, he had travelled to Bangladesh, Myanmar, France, Germany and the UK. The Nepali media has reported that Shringla will be in Kathmandu on November 26-27 but the MEA, which confirms high-level visits closer to the actual dates, has officially not spoken on the dates.The visit to Nepal will build on the signals of renewed friendship from Baluwatar since August 15 when Nepal PM K P Oli made a courtesy phone call to PM Narendra Modi. This was followed up with the sacking of the Defence Minister and holding back the publication of textbooks, both related to a territorial dispute with India.Since then, Indian Army chief Gen MM Naravane and RAW chief Samant Goel have called on Oli in Kathmandu, ostensibly for visits postponed earlier due to Covid, but also to clear misunderstandings featuring them.Shringla has just returned from Maldives where India’s post-Galwan Valley clash strategy of working in tandem with the US is being put to practice. The US has signed a defence framework agreement with the Maldives which was followed by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo landing in Male soon after the India-US 2 + 2 talks.India is undertaking the Greater Male Connectivity Project (GMCP), an economic lifeline connecting Male with Vilingili, the new commercial port at Gulhifalhu and industrial zone at Thilafushi.Shringla was also in Bangladesh which was soon visited by top US diplomat Stephen Biegun to turn around a relationship with PM Sheikh Hasina.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-to-be-shringlas-next-port-of-call-169321

11-11-2020||New Delhi||Left parties claim irregularities in final stages of vote counting in Bihar||The Left parties alleged on Wednesday that there were “irregularities” during the final stages of counting of votes in the Bihar Assembly polls on Tuesday and said the issue will be raised with the Election Commission (EC) soon.The three Left parties—Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) -- won an impressive 16 of the 29 seats they contested in the Bihar polls.“The Left parties are of the opinion that there were certain clear irregularities during the last stages of the counting that need to be seriously addressed by the Election Commission. Along with other partners of the Mahagathbandhan, the Left parties will take up these matters with the Election Commission of India,” the three parties said in a joint statement.Of the 16 seats, the CPI-ML (Liberation) won 12, while the CPI and the CPI(M) won two each.The parties thanked the voters of Bihar for their support to the Mahagathbandhan.“This included the candidates of the Left parties, which contributed to the Mahagathbandhan putting up a spirited contest in the election against the ruling BJP-JD(U) and its government.“The response of the youth and the people to the issues concerning people’s livelihood and employment was heartening,” the statement said.It also said the difference in the vote share of both the alliances was “very very small”.While the BJP-led alliance lost 12 per cent votes compared to what it had polled in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, incumbent Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) won only 43 seats, as compared to the 71 it had won in the last Assembly election, the statement said.“The CM’s defection from the Mahagathbandhan to the BJP is, amongst other factors, rejected by a large section of the electorate.“The BJP and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi raised the communal agenda to a very high pitch and sought to communally polarise the electorate. This was effectively met largely by the Mahagathbandhan’s focus on the economic distress caused by the lockdown and the utter failure of the BJP and its allies in containing the pandemic and galloping unemployment,” it said.The Left parties said their presence in the Bihar Assembly will be utilised to “advance the cause of the toiling people, raising crucial issues like jobs and on social/economic injustices”.“The struggles to achieve these objectives shall vigorously continue,” the three parties said.A stellar performance by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) enabled the ruling NDA to attain a simple majority in the 243-member Bihar Assembly notwithstanding a sharp fall in the tally of the JD(U). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/left-parties-claim-irregularities-in-final-stages-of-vote-counting-in-bihar-169317

The other two youth fled, while Sidam was dragged away by the tiger.The two boys alerted the villagers who gathered in large numbers. After searching, the villagers found the body of Vignesh. The big cat seemed to have eaten some flesh and abandoned the body.Tigers from the Tadoba-Andheri Tiger Reserve were known to shift to the adjoining forest areas of Asifabad and Kagaznagar in recent times. The movement of the tiger has led to panic, especially among those living in the villagers on fringes of the forest.Rebbena Forest Range Officer Purnima confirmed that a tiger killed the man.She, however, said that it was yet to be ascertained whether the trio had provoked the tiger.Locals tend to take photos and videos of the tigers to share it on social media platforms and this irritates the big cats and they, in turn, attack the humans, officials said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tiger-kills-21-year-old-tribal-man-in-telangana-169312

The nation has left that behind and moved towards tax transparency,” he said.“The change from tax terrorism to tax transparency has happened because we have propagated the concept of reform, perform and transform,” he emphasised.The Prime Minister further said not much happened post Independence to change the exploited and exploiter relation between the taxpayer and tax collector.But now change is happening, he said and went on to cite measures like faceless appeals, quick refunds and dispute resolution mechanism.“We are reforming rules and procedures and using technology,” he said, adding the tax administration is being transformed.India, he said, is among the select few nations which have codified rights and responsibilities of taxpayers. “This is an important step in restoring trust and transparency between taxpayer and tax collector.”Stating that wealth creators should be honoured, he said easing their problems will help in growth of the economy.Acceptance of as many as 99.75 per cent of the tax returns without a doubt is a step towards trusting the taxpayer, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-has-shifted-from-tax-terrorism-to-tax-transparency-pm-modi-169308

It contested 144 seats, 43 more than last time, but won 75, five less than 2015, bringing their strike rate down to 52.A better strike rate for the BJP also meant that a negative swing in its vote share since 2015 -- from 24.42 per cent to 19.5 per cent -- did not have any impact on their seat tally.As for the RJD, their higher vote share of 23.1 per cent this time around -- 3.6 percentage point higher than the BJPs could fetch it just one seat more than the saffron party.Also, the RJD vote share jumped from 18.35 per cent, explained by the larger number of constituencies they contested this poll, but their seat tally came down due to a reduced strike rate.BJP partner JD(U), which fought the 2015 election in alliance with the RJD and Congress, has not only suffered in terms of vote share but also in strike rate which relegated it to the third position in the current state assembly elections after the RJD and the saffron party.The Nitish Kumar-led party had contested 101 seats in 2015, winning 71 of them at a strike rate of 69.3 per cent.In the 2020 poll, the party contested 115 seats and won just 43, their strike rate down to 37.4 per cent, a negative swing of almost 32 per cent, which was in a way compensated by the BJPs upswing of over 33 per cent.The JD(U)s vote share came down marginally from 16.83 per cent to 15.39 per cent, a decrease of 1.44 percentage point, most of which can be attributed to the LJPs upswing of 0.83 percentage point.RJD ally Congress contested 70 seats this time and won 19, eight fewer than 2015 when it had fielded candidates in 41 constituencies.The party, however, has improved its vote share from 6.6 per cent to 9.4 per cent.The biggest gainers in terms of strike rate this time were the three Left parties -- the CPI-ML (SR 63.15% from less than four), CPI-M (SR 50% from zero) and CPI (SR 33.33% from zero) -- and the Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIS which won five of the 20 constituencies (SR 35%) it fought.In 2015, the CPI-ML (Liberation) has contested 98 seats and won just three at a strike rate of less than four per cent, but it improved to 63.15 per cent this time winning 12 of the 19 contested.The CPI (M) and the CPI, both of whom had drawn blank in the 2015 polls, scored a strike of 50 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively, this year in the four and six seats they contested.The AIMIM, which had zero seats in 2015 with a .21 per cent votes share, improved on both counts as it scored a strike rate of 35 per cent and clocked 1.24 per cent votes.Though their five seats do not look significant in an assembly of 243 members, they dented the Mahagathbandhans chances from the Kosi-Seemanchal region which went to polls in the third and final phase.During the electioneering, the Congress had termed the AIMIM a "B" team of the NDA.For Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party, the story is much in the votes he got, which did not translate into seats but spoiled the JD(U) game, rather than the strike rate.The LJP won just one seat -- it had contested 42 in 2015 and won two -- but its vote share went up from 4.83 per cent to 5.66 per cent, an increase of .83 percentage point, which mainly contributed to the JD(U)s decline of 1.44 percentage point.The LJP had contested 137 seats this year, fielding most of its candidates against the JD(U), which Chirag Paswan had vowed to oust from the power.The LJP might not have succeeded in doing exactly that, but it leaves the JD(U) a dented political force and a distant third in terms of not only seats but also clout.NDA allies Vikassheel Insaan Party also scored a strike rate of 36.4 per cent, winning four of the 11 seats it contested, while the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) won four of the seven seats it contested, at a strike rate of 57.4 per cent.

11-11-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Govt approves Rs 1.46 lakh crore more to boost manufacturing in 10 sectors||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 11The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the expansion of Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme to 10 more key sectors at an additional cost of Rs 1.46 lakh crore spread over a period of five years with the twin aims of strengthening domestic manufacturing capability and reducing import dependence.The PLI scheme already exists in three sectors at a total outlay of Rs 51,311 crore. The maximum allocation under the existing scheme is of Rs 40,951 crore for mobile manufacturing and specified electronic components to reduce the import dependency on China. Another PLI scheme for critical key starting materials in the pharma sector is being given Rs 6,940 crore and Rs 3,420 crore is for the manufacturing of medical devices.This expansion of the scheme – over three times each in terms of product categories and financial outlay—will make Indian manufacturers globally competitive, attract investment in the areas of core competency and cutting-edge technology and make India an integral part of the global supply chain, said an official news release after the Cabinet meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi.The new 10 sectors with their outlays are as follows: Advance Chemistry Cell (ACC) battery Rs 18,100 crore, Electronic/Technology Products Rs 5,000 crore, Automobiles & Auto Components Rs 57,042 crore, pharmaceuticals and drugs Rs 15,000 crore, Telecom & Networking Products Rs 12,195 crore, Textile Products Rs 10,683 crore, Food Products Rs 10,900 crore, High Efficiency Solar PV Modules Rs 4,500 crore, White Goods (ACs & LED) Rs 6238 crore and Speciality Steel 6322 crore.The PLI scheme will be implemented by the ministries concerned and will be within the prescribed financial limits. Savings, if any, from one PLI scheme of an approved sector can be utilised to fund that of another approved sector. Any new sector for PLI will require fresh approval of the Cabinet.ACC battery manufacturing is one of the largest economic opportunities of the twenty-first century for consumer electronics, electric vehicles and renewable energy. The PLI scheme will encourage large domestic and international players to set up a competitive ACC battery set-up in the country. For the automotive industry, the scheme will focus on making it more competitive. The Indian pharmaceutical industry, third largest by volume, will encourage the global and domestic players to engage in high value production.The PLI scheme in telecom equipment is expected to attract large investments from global players and help domestic companies seize the emerging opportunities and become big players in the export market.For textiles, it aims to attract large investments, especially in the MMF segment and technical textiles. In food processing, it will focus on specific product lines with high growth potential to generate medium- to large-scale employment.As large imports of solar PV panels pose risks in supply-chain resilience and have strategic security challenges, a PLI scheme will enable the buildup of large-scale solar PV capacity in India. In white goods, it will lead to more domestic manufacturing and increased exports. For steel, the PLI scheme will be for export-oriented value added steel leading.The Prime Minister’s clarion call for an ‘AatmaNirbhar Bharat’ envisages policies for the promotion of an efficient, equitable and resilient manufacturing sector in the country.Growth in production and exports of industrial goods will greatly expose the Indian industry to foreign competition and ideas, which will help in improving its capabilities to innovate further. Promotion of the manufacturing sector and creation of a conducive manufacturing ecosystem will not only enable integration with global supply chains but also establish backward linkages with the MSME sector in the country. It will lead to overall growth in the economy and create huge employment opportunities, said an official news release.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-approves-rs-1-46-lakh-crore-more-to-boost-manufacturing-in-10-sectors-169303

11-11-2020||New Delhi||Pollution control board orders closure of hot mix plants, stone crushers in Delhi-NCR till Nov 17||The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Wednesday directed a closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi-NCR till November 17, considering a likely increase in pollution levels during the festive season.It also asked the governments of Punjab and Haryana to take immediate stringent actions to curb stubble burning and authorities in Delhi-NCR to strictly check biomass burning.“Frequency of mechanised cleaning of roads and water sprinkling to be increased, particularly on road stretches with high dust generation potential,” the apex pollution watchdog said in an order.“It should be ensured that guidelines and standard operating procedures for dust mitigation at construction sites are strictly adhered to,” it added.In case of any violation, strict action such as imposition of penalty and a temporary stoppage of construction activities should be taken against the violators, the CPCB order read.The Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas had on Tuesday tasked the CPCB with operationalising and monitoring GRAP measures till a mechanism is set up by the newly-constituted panel.The commission had also decided that in view of the deteriorating air quality in the NCR, there is a need to invoke the GRAP, which has already been notified by the central government.The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) -- a set of anti-pollution measures followed in Delhi and towns in its vicinity according to the severity of the situation—came into force on October 15.It was notified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2017 for implementation through the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority.The measures under the GRAP include increasing the numbers of bus and metro services, hiking parking fees and stopping the use of diesel generator sets when the air quality turns poor.When the situation turns “severe”, the GRAP recommends a closure of brick kilns, stone crushers and hot mix plants, sprinkling of water, frequent mechanised cleaning of roads and maximising power generation from natural gas.The measures to be followed in the “emergency” situation include stopping the entry of trucks in Delhi, a ban on construction activities and introduction of the odd-even car rationing scheme. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pollution-control-board-orders-closure-of-hot-mix-plants-stone-crushers-in-delhi-ncr-till-nov-17-169295

We believed the JD(U) headed by Kumar needed to be emaciated and we succeeded.We wanted to make the BJP stronger and its heft has increased unquestionably," Paswan said.Addressing a press conference here, Paswan said he was happy that the BJP had emerged "much bigger and stronger" in Bihar, and ruled out any possibility of a truck with the opposition Grand Alliance, comprising RJD, Congress and three Left parties, citing "ideological differences".He also asserted that the LJP displayed "courage" in going solo and ended up with a better vote share though it could not convert into seats.Paswan, whose party fared abysmally securing just one seat in the assembly elections, said the LJP did not wish to carry the tag of "pichhlaggu", the one who rides piggyback.The 37-year-old, whose brinkmanship has been blamed by leaders like Sushil Kumar Modi, a BJP veteran and Deputy Chief Minister, for the NDA's sub-optimal performance, hopeful that his relations with the BJP at the Centre will not be affected since many allies of the saffron party, including the JD(U), have in the past challenged it electorally in states."If anybody deserves to be congratulated on the NDA's victory in Bihar, it is Prime Minister Narendra Modi. People have reposed their trust in his leadership and his vision for 'Atmanirbhar Bihar'. We always wanted to see a government in the state headed by the BJP and supported by the LJP. But we respect the mandate given by the people," Paswan said.The son of late Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan maintained that "Nitish Kumar as the chief minister is not good for Bihar" and that there was "no question of us supporting a government headed by him"."It is another thing that the NDA in Bihar comprising BJP, JD(U) and two smaller parties - have the numbers and does not need our support," he added.Paswan also took exception to the epithet "votekatwa" (spoiler) used for the LJP in the just-concluded elections by many, including Sushil Kumar Modi."LJP did make us lose at least 25 seats by playing the votekatwa. Had things been otherwise, the NDA would have crossed the tally of 150 in the 243-strong House," Modi told a news channel.About Kumar's possibility of retaining the chair despite having won fewer seats than the BJP, Modi said, "Our top leadership had made it clear that he will remain the CM if the NDA achieved power, irrespective of how many seats are won by which party. It is not for me to comment more on issues which are decided in the BJP by its parliamentary board." Paswan wanted to know why the LJP be talked about in derogatory terms when it had only worked on expanding its base and succeeded in raising the vote share to nearly six per cent, a two-fold rise since 2015. He said the party will emerge stronger in 2025.About the prospects at the Centre where the LJP is left with no representation in the Narendra Modi cabinet, Paswan said, "We are in the NDA at the Centre and happenings in Bihar will have no bearing on it. Ramdas Athawale's party has contested in polls against the BJP and the JD(U) has done the same in many states. What we did is not without precedent"."If the question is whether we would again join the government, have someone from our party as a minister in the Union council of ministers, I would say we would cross the bridge when it comes," he said.Paswan was also asked about his repeated allegations about corruption in government schemes and threats of sending Nitish Kumar to jail if the LJP became a part of the next government."Corruption is there, nobody can deny. It is for the government to investigate things. We will keep supplying evidences whenever we find," the LJP chief said.He also said he does not think he will ever join hands with RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav or become a part of the Grand Alliance."We have ideological differences with them. Though I salute the momentum he generated for the RJD and its allies," he said in reply to a query.

11-11-2020||New Delhi||India, China on verge of reaching agreement to resolve border standoff in eastern Ladakh||India and China may be on the verge of a breakthrough in resolving the over six-month-long tense border standoff in eastern Ladakh with both sides broadly agreeing on a three-step process on disengagement of troops and withdrawal of weaponry from all major friction points in a time-bound manner, authoritative sources said on Wednesday.The broad contours of the proposal include removal of armoured personnel carriers within one day of inking an agreement, withdrawal of troops from specific areas on the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh and carrying out verification of the disengagement process by both the sides, they said.The specific proposals for the disengagement and restoration of the status quo ante as existed in April were finalised during the eighth round of high-level military talks between the Indian and Chinese armies in Chushul on November 6 on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control(LAC).The sources said both the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are looking at sealing the pact in the next round of Corps Commander-level talks as the proposals were agreed to by the two sides.The ninth round of military talks is likely to take place in the next few days.Nearly 50,000 Indian Army troops are currently deployed in a high state of combat readiness in various mountainous locations in eastern Ladakh in sub-zero conditions as multiple rounds of talks between the two sides have not yielded concrete outcome to resolve the standoff.China has also deployed an equal number of troops, according to officials. The standoff between the two sides erupted in early May.As a first step, both sides will remove their tanks, artillery guns, armoured vehicles and large equipment from the friction points along the LAC to their rear bases within three days from inking the agreement, the sources said.Under the second step, the PLA will go back to Finger 8 areas from their current position of Finger 4 on the north bank of Pangong lake while the Indian troops would position themselves close to the Dhan Singh Thapa post, the sources said. The mountain spurs in the area are referred to as Fingers.It was broadly agreed to withdraw around 30 per cent of the troops every day for three days, they said.In the third step, it was agreed to complete the disengagement process in areas along the southern bank of Pangong lake like Rezang La, Mukhpari and Magar hill.Indian troops occupied a number of strategic heights in the Mukhpari, Rezang La and Magar hill areas around the southern bank of the Pangong lake, after the PLA soldiers attempted to intimidate them in the area on the intervening night of August 29 and 30.“These are all proposals. There is no agreement signed yet,” said a high-level source.In the final phase of the disengagement process, both sides will carry out a detailed verification process following which normal patrolling is expected to resume, the sources said.It is learnt that the top military brass deliberated on the proposals for disengagement and de-escalation of tension in eastern Ladakh before the eighth round of Corps Commander talks with the PLA.The disengagement proposal in Finger areas will mean there will be no patrolling between Finger 4 and 8 areas till there is a resolution of the standoff. India used to patrol till Finger 8.Army chief general M M Naravane on Tuesday said he was hopeful that the Indian and Chinese militaries will be able to reach an agreement on disengagement and de-escalation of tension in eastern Ladakh.After the last round of military talks, both sides described the negotiations as candid, in-depth and constructive.They said it was agreed to earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries and ensure that the frontline troops exercise restraint and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation.At the seventh round of talks too, both sides had agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement “as early as possible”.India has all along been maintaining that the onus is on China to carry forward the process of disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points in the mountainous region.Following the sixth round of military talks, the two sides announced a slew of decisions including not to send more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoid taking any actions that may further complicate matters.The sixth round of talks took place days after External Affairs Minister S  Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi reached a five-point agreement to resolve the row at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO) conclave.The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-on-verge-of-reaching-agreement-to-resolve-border-standoff-in-eastern-ladakh-169286
11-11-2020||Chandigarh||Doctor alleges victimisation in case of misappropriation of medical supplies at army hospital||A woman army doctor has approached the Armed Forces Tribunal alleging that she was being victimised and made a scapegoat in a case relating to gross misappropriation of medical supplies at an army hospital.She has averred that she was on leave during the period and the said vouchers for the issue of supplies had been signed by a different officer.The Tribunal’s Principal Bench has restrained the Army from moving the doctor, a lieutenant colonel in the Army Medical Corps, from her present place of posting at Amritsar to Lucknow for further disciplinary proceedings given her inability to undertake long-distance travel in the ongoing pandemic situation due to medical reasons, sources said.The doctor, now serving at Amritsar, was posted at Base Hospital, Lucknow in August 2014 and was given the responsibility of the officer-in-charge, medical stores.In June 2016, a pseudonymous complaint was received by the hospital commandant from a supply agency alleging that unauthorised medical stores were issued vide two vouchers by the Armed Forces Medical Stores Depot, Lucknow to the Base Hospital, which were sold off in Delhi by two junior commissioned officers and another person, resulting in the sale of their company being adversely affected.A one-man inquiry (OMI) was ordered by the Commandant to look into the facts, during which stores worth Rs 1.36 crore were recovered. The matter was brought to the notice of higher headquarters and subsequently, a Staff Court of Inquiry (COI) was ordered. In 2017, another COI was convened in the case.The COI was re-assembled in January 2019 and the doctor brought out some anomalies in the proceedings. She also averred that mandatory provisions like Army Rule 180 were not complied with during the COI and that the Army did not provide her with a copy of the proceedings.Consequently, disciplinary action was directed against her on seven charges and the Discipline and Vigilance Branch at Army Headquarters issued orders for her attachment to Army Medical Corps Centre and College, Lucknow for subsequent proceedings like hearing of charge and recording summary of evidence.Her counsel, Brig DK Ahluwalia (retd), claimed that orders issued last month for recording an additional summary of evidence at Lucknow are "unspecific, arbitrary and unreasonable and also against her medical condition".“The Tribunal has directed that the proceedings are now to be held at Chandimandir which should be completed within 7-10 days and she is provided with all medical facilities as required. Other issues concerning the case would be taken up subsequently,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doctor-alleges-victimisation-in-case-of-misappropriation-of-medical-supplies-at-army-hospital-169285

11-11-2020||New Delhi||Bihar victory belies anti-incumbency claims; Nitish to remain CM: State BJP chief Jaiswal||Bihar BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal on Wednesday credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi's welfare policies for the ruling NDA's win in the assembly polls and said all anti-incumbency claims have been negated by the mandate for a fourth term to the Nitish Kumar government.He also made it clear that Kumar will continue to head the NDA government in Bihar and asserted that the gap between the number of seats of BJP and JD(U) will have no impact on the ruling alliance dynamics in the state."Certainly, 100 per cent," Jaiswal told PTI when asked whether Kumar will remain the chief minister."We are allies and equals. We have to run Bihar collectively," he said."Wining the fourth term is always a great task for anybody. We have won that. This proves everything was fine. It is very rare that you win a fourth term in continuity. We have done this and it settles everything," Jaiswal said.Asked what he believes swung the hard-fought elections in the NDA's favour, he said it was largely due to Modi's welfare programmes for the poor."What the prime minister has done for the poor (that worked)... He provided them with electricity, cooking gas cylinders and toilets. They have also been given free ration for eight months following the corona outbreak. These were the biggest reasons," he said.To a question on the massive damage Chirag Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party inflicted on the NDA, especially the JD(U)'s prospects, he said that the LJP also hurt BJP in a number of seats.If the LJP was not there, the BJP would have defeated RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav in Raghopur constituency, Jaiswal claimed.He, however, insisted that the LJP was not a big factor but it was the rebels of both the BJP and the JD(U) who harmed the prospects of the NDA in many seats across the state.To a question on whether LJP will now have any place in the ruling alliance, he said it is for the BJP Parliamentary Board, the apex decision-making body of the saffron party, to decide on that.He, though, added that the NDA means the BJP, JD(U), Vikassheel Insaan Party and Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM(S) in Bihar.Asked about the reverses the NDA had in the first phase of polls in 71 seats on October 28, he acknowledged that in the south-west region of Bihar, the NDA faced difficulties and said it will be reviewed.The ruling coalition won 125 seats in the 243-member state assembly against 110 clinched by the opposition grand alliance to pave the way for a fourth successive term for Kumar in office but with diminished clout following a  debilitating slide in the number of JD(U) lawmakers that came down to 43 from 71 in 2015.The BJP had the best strike rate among all parties in the fray as it won 73 of the 110 seats it contests.Allies VIP and HAM(S) won four seats each.‘Committed to make Nitish the Bihar CM’Refusing  to draw comparisons between Bihar and Maharashtra, the BJP's Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday asserted that his party was committed to make Nitish Kumar the Chief Minister again, a day after poll results in the northern state were out."Maharashtra and Bihar are different states. It has already been decided that Nitish Kumar would be the CM there. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made an announcement to this effect and the BJP is committed to it. Nitishji will be the CM of Bihar (again)," Fadnavis said.The statement by Fadnavis -- BJP's election incharge for Bihar -- assumes significance as a similar situation had developed in Maharashtra a year ago after which its three-decade-old ally Shiv Sena broke off ties and ousted him as the CM in the western state.It came hours after the Shiv Sena expressed doubts whether the BJP would stick to its promise of making Nitish Kumar the CM as his party Janata Dal-United failed to even cross the 50-seat tally and now stands third (43 seats) in the state after Tejashwi Yadav's RJD (75 seats) and BJP (74 seats).After the 2019 Maharashtra assembly polls, the Shiv Sena got lesser seats than BJP but demanded the CM's post as per a BJP promise during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.However, after the BJP spurned the demand, the Shiv Sena broke away from the NDA to join hands with the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress and formed the Maha Vikas Aghadi with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM, stunning the BJP.While the Shiv Sena stuck to its ground that the post of CM -- irrespective of the number of number of seats it bagged -- had been assured to the party, Fadnavis and the then BJP President and Union Home Minister Amit Shah countered by saying there was no such commitment.--- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-victory-belies-anti-incumbency-claims-nitish-to-remain-cm-state-bjp-chief-jaiswal-169280
11-11-2020||Patna||Tejashwi Yadav: political novice who gave veterans a run for their money||An avid cricketer whose career never really took off, a political greenhorn who got power on a silver platter but failed to keep it, a scion of Bihar's most powerful family who could not get past the 9th grade.That was Tejashwi Yadav until the 2020 assembly polls marked the coming of age of a politician who valiantly went down fighting an army of battle-hardened veterans.He may have failed to learn the textbook lessons at DPS, R K Puram, in the national capital but showed an uncanny knack of reading the mind of voters, like his more famous father, as he led the opposition Grand Alliance to an impressive performance in the polls winning 110 seats in the 243-member assembly.He also powered the RJD to the status of the single largest party in the House with 75 seats.Analysts feel Tejashwi's poll promise of sanctioning "10 lakh government jobs at my first cabinet meeting" was a masterstroke which had the young voter swooning in a state reeling from widespread joblessness sparked by COVID-induced lockdown when the return of countless migrants home brought the state's largely agrarian economy under further stress.The promise was good but not good enough to bring down the NDA government.As part of a cleverly crafted strategy that endeared him to liberals, he chose to steer clear of contentious issues like the Ram temple, a bait thrown at him by top BJP leaders, and stuck to his core agenda of unemployment and alleged corruption in the Nitish Kumar administration.For a young man whose ability to lead the party was called into question after the RJD's unprecedented debacle in the Lok Sabha elections when it failed to win even one of the state's 40 seats, it was no mean feat that he succeeded in galvanising an organisational machinery in a stupor after the battering.Doubting his leadership qualities, allies HAM of former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, RLSP of former union minister Upendra Kushwaha and VIP of Mukesh Sahni jumped the ship in search of greener pastures elsewhere.Humility is a trait which, according to those who saw him at school or later as an aspiring cricketer, defines the younger son of two former chief ministers which was reflected in the manner in which he accommodated the Congress and the Left, seen as a spent force in the state ever since it was swept over by the Mandal wave.Another hallmark of his personality is the ability to think on his feet. After deciding early on in life that studies were not for him, Yadav chose not to cling to his cricketing aspirations either after the much-needed big break eluded him. Contracted by IPL franchise Delhi Daredevils for some time he remained in the reserve list.He announced his "retirement" from cricket just a couple of years before entering politics in 2015 at the tender age of 25. The new vocation came as a perfect pitch to bat on as he won from Raghopur in the assembly election comfortably.Soon Lalu made it clear that Tejashwi was his chosen successor, and he was appointed the Deputy Chief Minister in the Nitish Kumar government.As fate would have it, Tejashwi's name cropped up in a money laundering case related to alleged illegal land transactions when his father was the railway minister in the UPA-1 government. Tejashwi was in his teens when the alleged scam happened.The development drew heavy opposition fire and Nitish Kumar snapped his ties with the RJD, before returning to the NDA, giving up his ambition of heading a nationwide coalition for a "Sangh Mukt Bharat" which could pose a challenge to the Narendra Modi juggernaut.Tejashwi took the sudden loss of power on the chin, transitioning seamlessly into a doughty leader of the opposition.As Lalu landed in jail following conviction in a number of fodder scam cases, Tejashwi, by now the RJD's chief ministerial candidate, kept the party afloat and also rallied leaders as diverse as Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal and the Left bigwigs at a rally in New Delhi against the Muzaffarpur shelter home sex scandal, making his presence felt at the national level.Towards the end of 2018, he seemed bogged down by problems in the family. Much of his time and energy was spent trying unsuccessfully to prevent mercurial elder brother Tej Pratap's nasty marital dispute from playing out in the open.After the Lok Sabha poll fiasco, Tejashwi showed signs of torpor, choosing to spend most of his time away from Bihar and even giving a month-long assembly session a miss during an outbreak of brain fever and flash floods in north Bihar, providing the opposition with ample ammunition to attack him.Leaders of the JD(U)-BJP combine ridiculed him as an "ill-prepared student afraid of facing exams" when he demanded that the assembly elections be deferred in view of the raging COVID-19 pandemic.However, once the elections were announced, he steeled himself for the fight.The young leader displayed quiet ruthlessness while marginalising dissenters and guile in keeping his ambitious eldest sister Misa Bharti, a Rajya Sabha MP, away from the campaign and Tej Pratap confined to his Hasanpur seat.As the NDA seemed losing its earlier surefootedness, doddering under the weight of LJP leader Chirag Paswan's rebellion, he seized the moment and launched an indefatigable campaign, addressing more than a dozen rallies a day.His frequent references to himself as "sher ka beta" (son of a lion) notwithstanding, leaders of the JD(U) and the BJP claimed he was shying away from using the pictures of his parents in his campaign as they were emblematic of the "jungle raj".Prime Minister Narendra Modi lent weight to the narrative by frequently referring to him as the "Jungle Raj Ke Yuvraj".He might have failed to lead his alliance to victory, but the assembly polls have heralded the advent of a young leader on Bihar's political firmament who can feel the pulse of youth and has abundant promise.

The need of the hour is to change our lifestyles and make water conservation a way of life,” Naidu said.India’s current water requirement is estimated to be around 1100 billion cubic meters per year and that it is projected to touch 1447 BCM by 2050.The water resource management has to be planned in the context of rising population, urbanization, industrialization and expanding agricultural activities.The benefits of reduced use of water was also less use of energy required for pumping and supplying water to homes, offices and farming activities, he said.“In effect, it also will also help in reducing pollution”, Naidu said.Speaking on the occasion, Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Chauhan said sufficiency of water resources substrates country’s overall progress.Speaking on the sidelines of the function, Union Minister of State for Jal Shakti Ministry Rattan Lal Kataria said the call for conservation of water is getting good response in the states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vice-president-naidu-calls-for-peoples-movement-for-water-conservation-169278
11-11-2020||New Delhi||LJP cheated NDA; Modi biggest reason for our Bihar victory: Bhupender Yadav||A day after the BJP-JD(U) alliance won assembly polls in Bihar, the BJP's general secretary and the state in-charge Bhupender Yadav on Wednesday said the NDA was cheated by its former member LJP of Chirag Paswan in the elections and the confusion created by them caused some losses.Yadav also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's credibility was biggest factors behind the NDA's victory in the polls, while guidance of senior union Minister Amit Shah and on-ground presence of the party president JP Nadda also made a significant contribution.Taking on Lok Janshakti Party, Yadav said the party has lost its credibility and there are question marks about its politics. "LJP has chosen its own path and in a way, it cheated the NDA. People of Bihar have conveyed to them their importance in the state politics," he said.Despite all this confusion, people of Bihar reposed their faith in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership and his credibility and it is the big achievement that the NDA won for the fourth time in the state. "Modiji's leadership and his credibility was the single biggest reason for NDA's victory in the state," he said.When asked why NDA could not repeat its Lok Sabha performance in Bihar assembly polls, Yadav said every election is different and the central and state elections are fought on different issues. Besides, there were some local reasons, he added.In assembly elections, voters have different preferences and there are local issues, while dynamics of the state politics are also different from that of the national politics, he said.  "In terms of social equations, our alliance was in a strong position and the NDA government had also done developmental work across the state. But by continuously speaking lies, LJP created confusion and that caused losses for the BJP-JD(U) in the first phase," he said.There were some local issues of the state also, due to which the NDA got a few fewer seats, but the alliance has managed to get a clear majority in the state, Yadav said. On what could be the reasons for the under-performance of JD(U), Yadav said the NDA government had been in place for three terms in Bihar and it was a big issue to seek a mandate for the fourth term based on development."JD(U) contested well, but they also paid price for the confusion created by LJP. LJP vitiated the atmosphere which they should not have done... They were also part of the NDA. The party also enjoyed ministerial berth and reaped benefits from the alliance in Lok Sabha elections," Yadav said.Downplaying possibilities of any change of guard in the state, Yadav said, "The NDA got full majority and we respect collation dharma. And in the alliance, we believe all are equal." Talking about Tejashwi Yadav and RJD's performance, the BJP leader said they have been given the mandate to sit in the opposition and they should respect this and play their role.On the performance of left parties in the state, he said, "The rise of left parties in Bihar is worrisome as they believe in class conflict, which can disturb harmony in the state."   The results for three-phase Bihar assembly polls were declared late night on Tuesday. The NDA, which comprises of BJP-JD(U) along with HAM and VIP, sailed through the tough contest and got a simple majority with 125 seats.Their main challenger RJD-led grand alliance got 110 seats in the keenly fought contest.

11-11-2020||New Delhi||Over 7 lakh Bihar voters opted for NOTA option||A little over seven lakh voters in Bihar used the ‘none of the above’ or NOTA option in the assembly elections, according to the Election Commission.Nitish Kumar-led NDA was back in power in Bihar on Wednesday with a slender majority.The ruling coalition won 125 seats in the 243-member state assembly against 110 clinched by the opposition Grand Alliance to pave the way for a fourth successive term for Kumar in office.According to figures released by the EC, 7,06,252 people or 1.7 per cent of the voters opted for the option whereby they preferred not to vote for any candidate while exercising their democratic right.Over 4 crore votes were polled in the three-phase elections. Out of nearly 7.3 crore voters, 57.09 per cent had cast votes in the polls.The ‘NOTA’ option on electronic voting machines, introduced in 2013, has its own symbol—a ballot paper with a black cross across it.After the Supreme Court order in September 2013, the EC added the NOTA button on the EVMs as the last option on the voting panel.Prior to the apex court order, those not inclined to vote for any candidate had the option of filling, what is popularly called, ‘form 49-O’.But filling the form at the polling station under Rule 49-O of the Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, compromised the secrecy of the voter.The Supreme Court had, however, refused to direct the EC to hold fresh polls if the majority of the electorate exercises the NOTA option while voting.There were several seats in Bihar where NOTA option got more votes than the winning margin of candidates.

11-11-2020||Mumbai||Documentary about Indian soldiers of World War I premieres on Discovery Plus||“India: The Forgotten Army”, a documentary detailing the role played by Indian soldiers during the World War I, has started streaming on Discovery Plus, the streamer announced on Wednesday.An adaptation of the book “World War Sikh: Memoirs Of An Indian Cavalryman 1913-45” by Rana TS Chhina, the film traces and documents the courage of Indian soldiers, shipped to distant shores to live and fight in deplorable conditions during the First World War.It will feature expert insights from politician-writer Shashi Tharoor and a host of notable personalities including Tony McClenaghan- Military Historian, England and Dr Santanu Das- Professor of English Literature, King’s College London, the streamer said in a statement.The documentary also uses first-person accounts to tell the story of the war and the circumstances that Indian cavalrymen faced, as revealed in the letters they wrote to their families, more than a hundred years ago.Tharoor said that stories about the World War I have no mention of the Indian soldiers as they were relegated to the footnotes.“These men were undoubtedly heroes: pitchforked into battle in unfamiliar lands, in climatic conditions they were neither used to nor prepared for, fighting an enemy of whom they had no knowledge, risking their lives every day for little more than pride.“Yet they were destined to remain largely unknown once the war was over: neglected by the British, for whom they fought, and ignored by their own country, since they were fighting a colonial war. History had orphaned them. This film is a valuable contribution to their overdue rehabilitation,” Tharoor said.Issac John, Business Head – Digital (South Asia) at Discovery, said that “India: The Forgotten Army” will shine a light on the tales of courage and sacrifice of Indian soldiers.“Our users have repeatedly expressed their interest in knowing more about the storied past of our brave soldiers and this release reaffirms our brand’s commitment to listen to our users,” he said.“At Discovery Plus, we aim to bring meaningful and relevant content for our passionate users. It is our constant effort to offer world class documentaries to discerning Indian fans who are looking for such content which not only entertains but also encourages and inspires them,” he added.

11-11-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena praises Tejashwi Yadav for putting up ‘glorious fight single-handedly’||The ruling Shiv Sena thumped the back of RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav for putting up “a glorious fight single-handedly”, leading to the emergence of ‘youth power’, and fighting against all odds in the just-concluded Bihar Assembly elections.Terming the results as largely on the expected lines, the Sena on Wednesday said that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) has nevertheless received a major setback at the hustings.“The Bharatiya Janata Party-JDU partnership gained and the NDA alliance returns to power, the moot question is whether Nitish Kumar will become the Bihar CM again,” the Sena said in twin edits in the party newspapers ‘Saamana’ and ‘Dopahar Ka Saamana’.The issue may remain hanging as JD(U) failed to bag even 50 seats compared with the BJP’s 74, and Union Home Minister Amit Shah was compelled to declare that even if Nitish Kumar’s party secured less seats, he would become the CM.“He (Shah) had made a similar promise to Shiv Sena in 2019, but broke it and a new political ‘Mahabharata’ raged in Maharashtra. If he keeps the assurance made to Nitish Kumar now, then its credit goes to Shiv Sena,” the edits said, dropping dark hints if the BJP reneges on its promise again.Whatever may happen on the governance front, the Sena says that “a new era of the youth led by the young and firebrand Tejashwi Yadav has dawned in the Bihar politics”, and he single-handedly challenged the might of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Shah, JP Nadda, Nitish Kumar and others on the ruling side.“What was scorned as a ‘one-sided’ election became a real ‘contest’ only because of Tejashwi Yadav’s campaign. At his stormy rallies, this 31-year-old boy raised the questions of development, employment, education, health, which were earlier sidelined for 15 years,” the Sena pointed out.“While Modi labelled this boy as the ‘Crown Prince of Jungle Raj’, etc., Tejashwi remained composed and restrained in his campaign, though Nitish Kumar was so rattled by the prospects of a defeat that he made an ‘emotional appeal’ saying this was his last election.”Tejashwi Yadav’s Mahagathbandhan (MGB) performed well, with the RJD emerging as the single-largest party (75 seats), besides the Left parties putting up a good show.“We don’t think that Tejashwi Yadav has lost...Losing an election is not a defeat, just as juggling figures to increase the tally is not a win. The rulers lost no opportunity to defame and corner him, but he gave a tough challenge, just like his family, not stopping or stumbling before the powerful leaders in New Delhi and Patna,” the Sena noted.“This moment will be recorded in the country’s political history. Bihar election has given a new name of Tejashwi Yadav to the nation’s politics. The more he is praised for it, the less” the edits concluded.

It had asked Rampal and Gabriella to join the investigation on Wednesday.However, sources said that Rampal is likely to be questioned by the NCB on Thursday.The search at the residence of the model-turned-actor came a day after the NCB arrested Bollywood producer Firoz Nadiadwala's wife Shabana Saeed after ganja was allegedly found at their residence in suburban Juhu.The NCB had seizedelectronic gadgets like laptops, mobile phones and tablets during the search at Rampal's residence and questioned the actor's driver.Last month, Gabriella's brother Agisilaos Demetriades was arrested by the NCB from a resort in Lonavala in drugs case, the official had said.It was alleged that he was in touch with drug peddlers.Last Thursday, the court had awarded to the anti-drugs agency his custody along with that of executive producer Kshitij Prasad in another drugs case in which four grams of cocaine was recovered from a Nigerian national Uka Emeka in Andheri last month.The NCB had launched a probe into the alleged drug use in Bollywood after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June on the basis of WhatsApp chats involving drugs.The Central agency had earlier arrested Rajput's girlfriend, actress Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, some employees of the late filmstar and a few others under various sections of the NDPS Act.Rhea Chakraborty and some other accused are currently out on bail.

It is followed by Kerala with 6,010 cases, the ministry said.There are 4,94,657 active cases of coronavirus infections as on date. It was 4,96,988 on July 28.“This also indicates a sustained trend of declining active cases in the country. It assumes higher significance in the context of several countries across the globe reporting a surge in the number of new cases,” the ministry said.This landmark achievement has been made possible by the Centre’s sustained, graded and targeted strategies, their effective implementation by states and UTs, dedicated and selfless service of doctors and all other COVID-19 warriors, it said.Twenty-seven states and UTs have less than 20,000 active cases, the ministry highlighted.“Just 8 states and UTs have more than 20,000 cases; two states (Maharashtra and Kerala) have active cases more than 50,000,” the ministry said.A total of 44,281 new cases have been reported in a span of 24 hours while 50,326 cases have recovered during this period.

11-11-2020|| New Delhi||Arnab Goswami walks out of Taloja Jail after SC grants in interim bail||Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami was released from Navi Mumbai's Taloja jail hours after the Supreme Court on Wednesday granted him interim bail.Mumbai Police are investigating Goswami's role in connection with a suicide case.“We are of the considered view that the High Court was in error in rejecting the applications for the grant of interim bail, a Vacation Bench of Justice DY Chndrachud and Justice Indira Banerjee said. In its interim order, the court ordered the Maharashtra authorities to release the journalist forthwith. A reasoned verdict will be delivered later.The Bench also granted interim bail to co-accused Feroz Mohammad Shaikh and Neetish Sarda, “subject to each of them executing a personal bond in the amount of Rs 50,000 to be executed before the Jail Superintendent”.The top court, however, directed the three accused to cooperate in the investigation and not make any attempt to interfere with the ongoing investigation or with the witnesses.“The concerned jail authorities and the Superintendent of Police, Raigad are directed to ensure that this order is complied with forthwith,” it said.“Whatever be his ideology, at least I don’t even watch his channel, but if in this case constitutional courts do not interfere today, we are travelling the path of destruction undeniably,” Justice Chandrachud said.“The point is can you deny personal liberty of a person on these allegations… If the government targets individuals on this basis...You may not like television channels, but this should not happen,” the court said during the hearing that went on for the entire day.Expressing serious concern over state governments targeting some individuals on the basis of ideology and difference of opinion, the top court said they must realise that there was the Supreme Court to protect the liberty of citizens.Goswami and the two other accused had challenged the Bombay High Court’s November 9 order denying them interim bail in connection with the 2018 alleged abetment to suicide of an interior designer and had asked them to approach the sessions court.“We are seeing case after case where high courts are not granting bail and failing to protect personal liberty of people,” the Bench said during the hearing.Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing Goswami, argued that the re-investigation ordered by the Maharashtra Home Minister was illegal and mala fide and a constitutional court must look into these aspects and technical argument on regular bail, etc, can’t come in the way.“A man in Maharashtra committed suicide, saying the Chief Minister failed to pay him salary? What do you do? Arrest the Chief Minister?” Salve wondered. There has to be direct and proximate cause to invoke the change of abetment to suicide, he submitted.On behalf of Maharastra Government senior counsel Kapil Sibal and senior counsel Amit Desai opposed Goswami’s plea. The other two accused were represented by senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi and Gopal Sankaranarayanan.

11-11-2020||Kolkata||Local train services resume in West Bengal after over 7 months||Suburban train services resumed in West Bengal on Wednesday after more than seven months, with authorities maintaining a strict vigil and passengers largely adhering to the COVID-19 protocol.The local train services under the jurisdiction of the Eastern and the South Eastern Railways resumed early in the morning. They were suspended in March following the COVID-19 outbreak.The EMU trains were not choc-a-bloc as was the usual scene during pre-COVID times but the passenger footfall is expected to increase gradually, as the inexpensive public transport is preferred by many people living in the suburbs.The railway authorities have requested the passengers to conform to the COVID-19 protocol and made the wearing of masks mandatory for entering stations or trains.Apart from alternate seating arrangements in coaches with every other seat being cross-marked for maintaining a physical distance between two passengers, the railways have made spot markings for queueing of the commuters at all important places including platforms and booking counters.Passengers expressed happiness over the resumption of the local train services, saying it will not only reduce their journey time but also save money.“I had to change two buses to reach my office at Sector V in the Salt Lake area. It used to take me double time than train journey duration. Also, I had to shell out more money on travel as it is a health risk to board overcrowded buses,” Sanjay Dutta from Kalyani in Nadia district said.Commuters also sought an increase in the number of trains to ensure that the coaches are not crowded.“Increasing the number of trains will mean lesser passengers in each coach, which will help in maintaining physical distancing,” Papia Banerjee, a daily commuter from Baruipur in South 24 Parganas district to Esplanade in central Kolkata said.The Eastern Railway is operating 413 suburban trains in Sealdah division and 202 in Howrah division from Wednesday, an official said.To avoid overcrowding of trains, 148 of 177 time- tabled services are being run during peak hours, he said.The South Eastern Railway is running 81 daily services from Wednesday, with 40 EMU locals in the up direction and 41 in the down direction, a spokesperson of the railway zone said.

Is there any special Order or Direction from Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India and the Master of the Roaster in this regard?" Dave asked."It is quite well known that such extraordinarily urgent listings of matters cannot and does not take place without specific orders from Hon'ble the Chief Justice. Or is it that as the Administrative Head you or the Registrar listing is giving special preference to Shri Goswami?" Dave wrote.Arnab's petition is listed for hearing before a Vacation Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud on Wednesday.Questioning Dave's "selective outrage", Goswami's wife Samyabrata Ray Goswamiwrote to the Supreme Court Secretary General, pointing out that cases filed by senior journalist Vinod Dua and activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan were also listed urgently. In another instance, a case filed on behalf of historian Romila Thapar was listed for hearing the same day in August last year, she wrote."When I read Dave's letter, I am shocked and horrified at the extent to which certain vested interests are at work. Neither do I know Shri Dave nor have I ever met him. However, the selective targeting of my husband's petition by Shri Dave will have to be opposed by me given his silence on other matters which were taken up by this Hon'ble Supreme Court in its wisdom with urgency in the past," she wrote.She alleged that Dave's letter was contemptuous as “it tends to interfere with administration of justice.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bar-association-chief-questions-urgent-listing-of-arnabs-petition-in-sc-169225
11-11-2020||Patna||Friendship with BJP helps Nitish Kumar to get Bihar CM's post for fourth consecutive term||For close to 15 years, he ruled politically volatile Bihar with a paradoxical cocktail of stubborn ideology and pragmatic resilience, making friends with foes and foes with friends at will.Nitish Kumar's unusual knack for spotting friends has ensured a fourth straight term for him in office despite the drastic slump in his electoral fortune that relegated his JD (U) to the third position in the state assembly with just 43 seats, down from 71 it had won in 2015.The most atypical of politicians owing their rise to post-Mandal politics, Nitish Kumar stood out for his ability to address the governance deficit, unlike a majority of the breed reared in the socialist stable, but was often accused of pursuing politics of opportunism.Call it political opportunism or sagacity, his moves, in effect, prevented the Hindutva forces from holding sway over Bihar, where a section of the BJP feels mortified over not having its own chief minister till date despite enjoying a near hegemonic status nationally.Known for weighing his options carefully before making any move, Kumar, upon a closer look, comes across as a risk taker who has not shied away from going against the tide.An engineer by training who had taken an active part in the JP movement, Kumar spurned a job offer from the state electricity department and decided to take the political gamble, an oddity among educated youth in Bihar for whom the lure of "sarkaari naukri" remains undiminished.Unlike Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan, his co- travellers during the movement led by Jayaprakash Narayan, electoral success eluded Kumar for long.He got the first taste of victory after three defeats in the 1985 assembly polls when he won from Harnaut as a candidate of the Lok Dal though the Congress swept the elections riding the tailwind generated by the assassination of Indira Gandhi the previous year.Four years later he entered the Lok Sabha from Barh even as fellow MP from Saran Lalu Prasad shifted to Bihar, taking over as the chief minister and scripting a spectacular success story which altered the state's political landscape.Kumar, one of the most articulate leaders of the Janata Dal, had fully backed Lalu in the keenly fought internal contest for chief ministership.The next decade-and-a-half saw Prasad's rise as one of the most powerful but controversial figures of his time who ruled the state by proxy, getting his demure homemaker wife Rabri Devi elected as his successor, when a charge sheet in fodder scam forced him to step down as the chief minister.During the same period, Kumar burnt his bridges with Prasad, floated the Samata Party with George Fernandes, and built his own political edifice brick by brick.The Samata Party joined forces with the BJP and Kumar made a mark for himself as an outstanding parliamentarian and was reckoned among the most competent ministers in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet.After a rift between Sharad Yadav, the then Janata Dal president, and Lalu Prasad, the latter broke away and formed the RJD. The Samata Party merged with Sharad Yadav's Janata Dal, which was rechristened as JD(U), while continuing its alliance with the BJP.After the NDA lost power in 2004, a victory in Bihar held out the promise of a degree of redemption for the BJP-led alliance.Attempts to wrest power from the RJD-Congress combine, then in power at the Centre as well, after the NDA fell short of majority in the assembly polls of February, 2005, were stymied by Governor Buta Singh's controversial move to dissolve the assembly, without it having even been constituted, in the face of alleged horse trading.This, however, proved a blessing in disguise for Kumar who was projected as the chief ministerial candidate in the elections that took place nine months later and the JD(U)-BJP combine got a comfortable majority, bringing the so-called "Lalu era" to an end.Kumar's first five years as chief minister are recalled with admiration even by critics, marked as these were by vast improvement in law and order, though the new dispensation had no dearth of people with criminal background among its rank and file.Realising fully well that unlike Lalu, he did not have the advantage of belonging to a populous caste group, Kumar created sub-quotas among OBCs and Dalits who were called "Ati Pichhda" (EBC) and "Mahadalits", which was resented by the dominant Yadavs and Dusadhs, Paswan's fellow castemen.He also brought in measures like free bicycles and school uniforms for school-going girls, which won him much adulation and the exuberant public mood saw him return to power in 2010, leading the JD(U)-BJP coalition to a landslide victory in the assembly polls.The period, however, also saw the end of "Atal-Advani era" in the BJP and Kumar, who could not fathom the potential of his then Gujarat counterpart Narendra Modi, locked horns with him over the post-Godhra riots in the western state.\Flaunting his secular ideology, Kumar had succeeded in preventing Modi, seen as a polarising figure on account of the Gujarat riots, from campaigning for the BJP Bihar in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls and the assembly elections a year later, something that still riles Hindutva hardliners.He ultimately snapped his party's 17-year-old ties with the BJP in 2013 when Modi was anointed the BJP's campaign committee chief for the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.After parting ways with the BJP, he won a trust vote with the support of the Congress, but stepped down in 2014, owning moral responsibility for the JD(U)'s drubbing in the Lok Sabha elections, when the party returned with a dismal tally of just two.In less than a year, he was back as the chief minister, elbowing out his rebellious protg Jitan Ram Manjhi with support from the RJD and the Congress, and came to be seen nationally as a potential challenger to Modi.The Grand Alliance that came into being with the JD (U), Congress and the RJD coming together, won the 2017 assembly polls handsomely but came apart in just two years, after Kumar insisted that Lalu's son and deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav, whose name had cropped up in a money laundering case related to the time when RJD supremo was the railway minister, "come clear" on the issue.He abruptly resigned as the chief minister after RJD refused to budge, only to be back in office in less than 24 hours with BJP's support.Those who saw a "secular alternative" in Kumar felt let down and cried betrayal of "public mandate".But Nitish Kumar, often referred to as the modern day 'Chanakya' of Bihar after the artful advisor to Mauryan emperor Chandragupta, had kept a logic ready: "I will not compromise on corruption".

On the Bisfi seat, she had managed to bag less votes than None of the Above (NOTA) option.In Bankipur other contestants against her were three-time BJP MLA Nitin Naveen and Congress candidate Luv Sinha, son of actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha.From the Bisfi seat, BJP candidate Haribhushan Thakur and RJD MLA Dr Fayaz Ahmad were the other contestants. Pushpam Priya has bagged less than NOTA votes from this seat.Pushpam Priya is the daughter of former JDU MLC Vinod Chaudhary. She had created a stir by declaring herself as a CM candidate in newspapers before the Bihar elections. She had formed a party called Plurals and fielded engineers, doctors, social activists, teachers, professors as her candidates on several seats and herself contested from two seats. But she has failed to create an impact in the minds of the electorate it appears, since she has been trailing on both the assembly seats.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-cm-aspirant-pushpam-priya-loses-both-seats-gets-fewer-votes-than-nota-169219
11-11-2020||Bhopal||MP bypolls: BJP wins 19 out of 28 seats, Congress bags 9||The ruling BJP in Madhya Pradesh won 19 out of the 28 assembly constituencies, where bypolls were held on November 3, giving it a comfortable majority in the House and providing stability to its eight-month-old government in the state.The opposition Congress clinched nine seats.With this, the BJP now has 126 MLAs in the 230-member House, while the Congress has 96 legislators.Due to the resignation of one more Congress MLA recently, the effective strength of the House is 229 at present.The comfortable victory of the BJP, which needed only eight seats to have a full majority on its own in the 229-member House, will not only provide stability to the party-led government in the state, but also further cement the position of senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, who quit the Congress earlier this year and joined the saffron party.As per the results announced till Tuesday midnight, the BJP had won 16 seats and was leading in three others (Sanver, Jaura and Mehgaon). The results of these three seats, which the ruling party won, were declared post-midnight.Out of the 12 ministers who contested the bypolls, three were defeated by the Congress candidates. Prominent among them is woman minister Imarti Devi, who lost from Dabra by a margin of 7,633 votes.BJP minister Girraj Dandotia lost from Dimani by a margin of 26,467 votes.Another minister Adal Singh Kansana bit the dust from Sumaoli constituency by a margin of 10,947 votes.Scindia loyalist Tulsi Silawat won from Sanver by a margin of 53,264 votes.BJP minister OPS Bhadoria won from Mehgaon by a margin of 12,036 votes.The saffron party’s Munna Lal Goyal lost by a margin of 8,555 votes against Congress Dr Satish Sikarwar from Gwalior-East.Out of the 22 MLAs who had quit the then ruling Congress in March this year in support of Scindia’s move of leaving the party, 15 emerged victorious, while seven others, including three ministers, lost the poll battle.Though Congress left no stone unturned to portray Scindia as “traitor” because of his rebellion against the then chief minister Kamal Nath government that paved the way for the return of the BJP government in the state, the campaign plank failed to find much traction among voters.Scindia has repeatedly said his decision to quit the Congress was driven by “failure” of the erstwhile Nath government to fulfil promises made to people, especially farmers.“The victory of the BJP in these bypolls will certainly strengthen Scindia’s position in the BJP at the Centre,” a political expert said.Though the BJP fared well in 19 of these 28 seats, it suffered losses in the Gwalior-Chambal region as three of its ministers Adal Singh Kansana from Sumaoli, Imarti Devi from Dabra, whom Nath had termed “item” in the run-up to the bypolls, and Girraj Dandotia from Dimani, faced defeat.The BJP had a narrow win in Bhander, where its nominee Raksha Santram Saronia defeated popular Dalit leader Phool Singh Baraiya by a margin of 161 votes.Besides, a Scindia supporter also lost in Karera in Shivpuri district.“There are a total of 34 seats in Gwalior-Chambal region and among them Congress had won in 26 seats in 2018. Bypolls were held in 16 seats in this region and among them Scindia’s supporters won nine seats, which were basically the Congress seats,” BJP spokesperson Pankaj Chaturvedi said.“Earlier, the Congress had more than 80 per cent of these seats, which it had won because of Scindia factor,” he said.Scindia’s supporters won decisively in the assembly constituencies of Bamori, Mungaoli and Ashok Nagar, which are part of Guna Lok Sabha seat.Besides, among the six ministers that resigned from the Congress along with Scindia, only Imarti Devi lost in bypoll while his loyalists like Tulsiram Silawat, Mahendra Singh Sisodia, Govind Singh Rajput, Dr Prabhuram Choudhary and Pradyumna Singh Tomar won decisively from their respective constituencies.Choudhary created a record by winning with a highest margin 63,809 votes from Sanchi (SC) seat.BJP got 49.46 per cent vote share against the Congress’s 40.40 in these bypolls.Expressing happiness over the BJP’s victory, Scindia said, “I express my gratitude towards the voters for giving a clear mandate to the BJP. The results of the bypolls proved that both former chief ministers Kamal Nath and Digvijay Singh were betrayers. It has become a habit of the Congress to question the credibility of the EVMs by not accepting the mandate.”Elated over the BJP’s performance, CM Chouhan said that the BJP has secured 11 per cent more votes than their rival Congress and termed it as “incredible”.“We won the seats by huge margins and lost few by a thin margin. We humbly accept the victory,” he said while announcing to implement the roadmap for ‘Aatmnirbhar Madhya Pradesh’ campaign immediately.Chouhan also accused the opposition Congress of making false allegations and using indecent words against the BJP leaders.Congress leader Kamal Nath accepted the defeat and said that his party made efforts to reach out to the public.“We accept the mandate. We made every effort to reach out to the public. I also thank all the voters who took part in the by-elections. I hope that the BJP government will take care of the interests of the farmers, provide employment to the youth, maintain the respect and safety of women,” Nath said in a tweet.In March this year, 22 Congress MLAs, mostly loyalists of Scindia, had resigned from the party and their Madhya Pradesh Assembly membership.This led to the collapse of the Kamal Nath-led state government and cleared the way for the BJP to again come to power.Scindia and his loyalists had joined the BJP, with many of them becoming ministers in the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government.

The BSF detained them at around 2 pm on Tuesday.According to the villagers, five RAB members entered Samajia Mandalpara area of B-Amtali Saraswatipur border of Dinajpur on motorcycle.Divided into two groups, the RABs embarked on the expedition, entered the Indian border village and three of them arrested Indian citizen, Milon—son of Israfil.Milon started shouting and another, Musharraf, attacked the RAB officials.

11-11-2020||Patna||NDA overcomes stiff challenge to retain power in Bihar; Nitish to get fourth successive term||Surmounting anti-incumbency of 15 years, a mutinous former ally, and a spirited challenge from a resurgent opposition that rose from its ashes like proverbial phoenix after the 2019 Lok Sabha poll debacle, Nitish Kumar-led NDA was back in power in Bihar on Wednesday with a slender majority.The ruling coalition won 125 seats in the 243-member state Assembly against 110 clinched by the opposition Grand Alliance to pave the way for a fourth successive term for Kumar in office but with diminished clout following a debilitating slide in the number of JD(U) lawmakers that came down to 43 from 71 in 2015.Kumar was then a partner in the Grand Alliance which included Lalu Prasad's RJD and the Congress.Its defeat notwithstanding, the RJD, whose campaign Tejashwi Yadav, the younger son and heir to party supremo Lalu Prasad helmed, emerged as the single largest party with 75 seats. The BJP, which led the table for several hours during the counting that dragged on for over 16 hours, finished second with a tally of 74 seats.Despite the slump in numbers, Kumar, who was declared the NDA's chief ministerial candidate by the BJP brass, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief JP Nadda, is set to take over the reins of the government.Much of Kumar's plight can be blamed on the damage Chirag Paswan's LJP inflicted on his JD(U). Down in the dumps with just one MLA, the party spoiled the JD(U)'s chances on at least 30 seats.JD(U) spokesperson KC Tyagi told PTI in New Delhi that a "sinister" campaign was run against Nitish Kumar as part of a "conspiracy"."Apne bhi shamil the aur begane bhi (Our own also harmed us along with the outsiders)," he said, without taking any names.He, however, expressed confidence that Kumar would become the chief minister again, noting that top BJP leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah had made it clear that he would head the government if the ruling NDA retained power.Bihar BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal voiced similar views in Patna when he said "the issue has been cleared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief JP Nadda much before the elections".Apart from BJP's 74 seats and JD(U)'s 43, the ruling alliance partners HAM and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) won four seats each.The drastic fall in the number of JD(U) MLAs, however, will likely make the BJP, which hitherto played a second fiddle to Kumar, more assertive, and it may insist on a larger share in the ministerial pie and greater say in governance.Apart from Kumar's creditable performance as an administrator, the multiple claimants to Muslim votes, including the Grand Democratic Secular Front (GDSF) comprising Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM, BSP and Upendra Kushwaha's RLSP worked in NDA's favour and scuppered the Mahagathbandhan's chances. Muslim and Yadav voters have for long formed the bedrock of the RJD's support base.Owaisi's AIMIM emerged as a surprise package of the election, winning five seats. The party had gained a foothold winning a seat in a by-election in Bihar earlier, but made significant inroads into the Seemanchanchal region which has a large presence of Muslim voters. Its ally BSP also clinched one seat.Kumar, who has a clean image, has been credited with ridding the state of the "jungle raj", as the Lalu-Rabri government of 15 years preceding 2005 is often described by its critics.The JD(U) leader also earned praise for his impetus on infrastructure development and improving health care system and education.Besides, Modi's enduring charisma not only powered the alliance's victory but also helped the BJP to pre-eminent position in the NDA in Bihar for the first time and cut his former bete noire Nitish Kumar, once considered a secular alternative to him, to size.The election also saw the coming of age of Tejashwi Yadav, who came across as an indefatigable leader after RJD's unprecedented drubbing in the Lok Sabha polls last year when it failed to open its account.The NDA had clinched all but one of the 40 seats in the state, leaving the young leader in torpor and his party demoralised. Tejashwi's ability to lead the party in the absence of his charismatic father and party supremo Lalu Prasad, who had landed in jail after conviction in fodder scam cases, was called into question.However, after the assembly elections were announced, he steeled himself for the struggle ahead and almost singlehandedly brought the five party Grand Alliance surprisingly close to power in a fight where an army of battle-hardened veterans were arrayed against him.A major upshot of the gruelling electoral tussle between the two alliances was the resurgence of Left, which aligned with the RJD-Congress combine after being pushed to the margins in the post-Mandal era politics of Bihar.The biggest gainer was the CPI-ML, which clinched 12 seats, followed by the CPI and CPI-M (two each). Barring the CPI-ML, which had three seats in the outgoing assembly, none of the Left parties had a presence in the House.Brothers Tejashwi Yadav and Tej Pratap won the Raghopur and Hasanpur seats with impressive margins of 38,174 and 21,139 votes respectively.Prominent losers from the RJD included Abdul Bari Siddiqui, a former state party chief, and Lalu Prasad's Man Friday Bhola Yadav who lost from Keoti and Hayaghat seats in Darbhanga respectively.Senior Bihar minister Vijendra Prasad Yadav of JD(U) won from Supual, and Niraj Singh Babloo of the BJP, a cousin of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, whose mysterious death became an election issue, retained the Chhatapur seat.State assembly speaker Vijay Kumar Chaudhary of the JD(U) was among the victors.Ace former shooter and Commonwealth gold medallist Shreyasi Singh of BJP won the Jamui seat by over 41,000 votes, but veteran socialist leader Sharad Yadav's daughter Subhashini lost in Bihariganj.HAM president Jitan Ram Manjhi defeated former state assembly speaker Uday Narayan Chaudhary in Imamganj of Gaya district.

11-11-2020||Washington||US Attorney General okays probe into vote ‘irregularities’||Attorney General William Barr has authorised federal prosecutors across the US to pursue “substantial allegations” of voting irregularities before the 2020 presidential election is certified, despite little evidence of fraud.Barr’s action comes days after Democrat Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump and raises the prospect that Trump will use the Justice Department to try to challenge the outcome.It gives prosecutors the ability to go around longstanding Justice Department policy that normally would prohibit such overt actions before the election is formally certified.Trump has not conceded the election and is instead claiming without evidence that there has been a widespread, multi-state conspiracy by Democrats to skew the vote tally in Biden’s favour.Biden holds a sizable lead in multiple battleground states and there has been no indication of enough improperly counted or illegally cast votes that would shift the outcome.In fact, election officials from both political parties have publicly stated the election went well, though there have been minor issues that are typical in elections, including voting machines breaking and ballots that were miscast and lost.In a memo to US attorneys, obtained by The Associated Press, Barr wrote that investigations “may be conducted if there are clear and apparently-credible allegations of irregularities that, if true, could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual State.”States have until December 8 to resolve election disputes, including recounts and court contests over the results. Members of the Electoral College meet December 14 to finalise the outcome. Although a few Republicans have urged Trump to concede, the President still held the support of prominent party leaders who had yet to congratulate Biden.Trump’s campaign on Monday filed a lawsuit to block Pennsylvania officials from certifying Biden’s victory in the battleground state, where Biden led by more than 45,000 votes. It alleged the state’s mail-in voting system violated the US Constitution by creating “an illegal two-tiered voting system” where voting in person was subject to more oversight than voting by mail.It was filed against Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar and the boards of elections in Democratic-leaning counties that include Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Boockvar’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“The Trump campaign’s latest filing is another attempt to throw out legal votes,” Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, said on Twitter. Pennsylvania state Representative Dawn Keefer on Tuesday planned to call for a legislative audit of the state’s election results. —AP‘Pursue substantial allegations’Wasn’t Trump’s yes-man: Esper||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-attorney-general-okays-probe-into-vote-irregularities-168908

Rather, they fear the situation may worsen with winds changing direction in next couple of days.Skymet’s Mahesh Palawat says, “The first strong Western Disturbance is expected around November 12. This will lead to formation of a cyclonic circulation over northern plains (Punjab and Haryana) and change in direction of winds from northwest to southeast, adding more humidity in the air and existing smog-conducive factors like light winds and pollutants.”There is a possibility of rain in Delhi-NCR around November 15 and 16. If it is moderate to intense, pollutants will be washed away. Light rain will add to factors building pollution, he says. The CAQM in the NCR and the adjoining areas listed out 10 immediate measures while stressing the need to strictly enforce standard operating procedures to minimise pollution on.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-air-quality-remains-severe-168912
11-11-2020||Vibha Sharma||BJP outpaces JD(U), in driver’s seat||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 10Even while swinging wildly between the two main contestants — JD(U)’s Nitish Kumar-led NDA and RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav-led Mahagathbandhan — the results of the 2020 Bihar elections today firmly put into place the BJP in the driving seat, reducing CM Nitish Kumar to the secondary position, for the first time in the NDA relationship in the state.Now, whosoever becomes the CM, the BJP has become the dominant political force in the Bihar, say political observers. Though the top BJP leadership has said Nitish will be the CM even if the JD(U) gets lesser numbers, voices are expected to start emerging from within the state unit for a BJP CM, they believe. And as the party’s national general secretary, Tarun Chugh, interestingly mentioned “it will be CM of the choice of PM, whether from the JD(U) or the BJP”.The downsizing of JD(U)’s numbers has also put on the roll the saffron party’s long-term plans to strike alone in the state sometime in future. And if Nitish becomes the CM, it will be on BJP’s terms. Therefore in those terms, the saffron party has emerged as the big gainer in these elections. The BJP called it an “endorsement” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his policies amid the Covid pandemic.The results from the by-polls and Bihar have also given BJP president JP Nadda much to cheer about.A section believes that Chirag actually “diverted attention from anger against Nitish”. “He played the role of a vote katuwa, but in favour of the NDA,” they say.“It was a combination of forward, non-Yadav OBCs and majority of MBCs, EBCs and Dalits that worked with VIP and HAM(S) adding key caste vote banks for the NDA. Mahagathbandhan’s decision to give more seats to Congress and part ways with Mukesh Sahani-led VIP worked for the NDA,” they add.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-outpaces-jdu-in-drivers-seat-168913
11-11-2020||New Delhi||Congress questions reliability of EVMs||After the ruling NDA took an initial lead from the grand alliance in poll trends for Bihar, Congress leader Udit Raj on Tuesday raised questions on the reliability of EVMs asking why they cannot be hacked if satellites can be controlled from the earth, the Election Commission (EC) asserted on Tuesday that the machines are “absolutely robust and tamper-free”.“If the direction of satellites to Mars and Moon can be controlled from the earth, then why can’t EVM be hacked,” Udit Raj said in a tweet in Hindi. “If elections were held in America with EVMs, could Trump have lost,” he asked.But another Congress leader, Karti Chidambaram, said the electronic voting machine (EVM) system is robust, accurate and dependable. “This has always been my view. I stand by it. There have been doubters of the EVM from across political parties, particularly when the results don’t go in their favour. Till now, no one has demonstrated scientifically their claims. Whatever be the outcome of any election, it’s time to stop blaming the EVM. In my experience, the EVM system is robust, accurate and dependable,” he tweeted. Responding to a question on doubts being raised by some politicians, Deputy Election Commissioner in-charge of EVMs Sudip Jain said the machines are absolutely robust and tamper-proof.“It has been clarified time and again that EVMs are absolutely robust and tamper-proof. Even the Supreme Court has upheld their integrity more than once,” he said.Jain recalled that in 2017, the commission had offered an “EVM challenge” to political parties. “The integrity of EVMs is absolutely without any doubts and merits no other clarification,” he said. — PTIEVMs absolutely robust and tamper-proof: ECResponding to doubts being raised by some politicians, Deputy Election Commissioner in-charge of EVMs Sudip Jain said the machines are absolutely robust and tamper-proof.“It has been clarified time and again that EVMs are tamper-proof.

With 20 per cent of the 4 crore ballots yet to be counted at 11.30 pm, the Election Commission website showed 123 leads for the BJP-JD(U) alliance and 112 for the RJD, Congress and Left Front coalition.The ruling NDA was thus just one seat ahead of the simple majority mark of 122 in the 243-member state Assembly with the fight in at least 35 seats too close to call. As the NDA widened its gap, the RJD and Congress alleged foul play. Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala petitioned EC officers in Patna, claiming that one of their candidates had been declared defeated by 1,700 votes when he had “actually won by 600 votes.”EDIT: Bihar election verdictThe RJD alleged that CM Nitish Kumar was pressuring returning officers to stop the count and declare close seats in favour of the NDA. The BJP leaders trashed the charges. Party spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said, “We live in transparent times where CCTVs and cellphone details are available everywhere. This is not Lalu Prasad’s jungle raj.” Tejashwi Yadav-led RJD emerged as the single largest party with 76 leads to BJP’s 72 (EC trends at 11.30 pm). Overall, the BJP and the Left parties emerged the biggest gainers while CM Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) and the Congress suffered severe blows. The BJP was up several notches from 53 seats it had won in 2015 when it fought on 157 seats against 110 this time.Social-distancing norms go for a tossSoon after the celebrations began with “Modi Hai Toh Mumkin Hai” and “Vande Matram” resonating in the air along with the beat of the dhols, social distancing norms went for a toss at the BJP headquarters. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cliffhanger-rjd-alliance-moves-poll-panel-168916

But it is unfortunate that there have been repeated efforts to bring bilateral issues on SCO agenda.— Narendra Modi, Prime Minister The PM made the comment in the presence of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Pakistan PM Imran Khan, Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top leaders of the influential grouping.Multilateral organisations such as SCO prohibit members from airing bilateral disputes, which led the PM to indirectly hint at India’s opposition to the CPEC route.The PM also said India’s priority during its two-year stint at the UNSC from January 1, 2021, and at other multilateral organisations was to strive for “reformed multilateralism” to meet the expectations of a world suffering from the social and financial after effects of the pandemic.The SCO summit host, Putin, seen taking notes during PM Modi’s address in Hindi, as well as Xi Jinping spoke against the “numerous attempts to directly interfere in the internal affairs” of SCO member countries, in a reference to the regime change agenda often pursued in countries around their periphery.This was the first SCO summit held in virtual format and the third that India participated after becoming a full member in 2017.The PM also underlined India’s strong cultural and historical connect with the SCO region and reiterated India’s firm commitment towards strengthening connectivity in the region.He also reiterated India’s readiness to host the next regular meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of Government on November 30 in virtual format.The PM also congratulated Tajik President Emomali Rahmon for assuming the chairmanship of the SCO next year and assured full cooperation from India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/respect-indias-sovereignty-pak-china-told-at-sco-meet-168923
