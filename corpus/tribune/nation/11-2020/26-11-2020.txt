26-11-2020||New Delhi||India had estimated 74 million COVID-19 infections by August: ICMR’s 2nd serosurvey||Nearly 7 per cent of India’s population aged 10 and above was exposed to SARS-CoV-2, amounting to an estimated 74.3 million infections by August, with the seroprevalence being highest in urban slum areas followed by urban non-slum and rural areas, the findings of ICMR’s second national serosurvey stated.According to the findings which have appeared in the Lancet Global Health pre-print, the overall seroprevalence of below 10 per cent in India indicates that a large proportion of the population remains susceptible to novel coronavirus infection.“The transmission of infection is expected to continue in most Indian states till the herd immunity threshold is achieved, either by natural infection or vaccination. While this threshold is unknown, most estimates place it above 50 per cent,” the report said.It stated that one in nine individuals who did not report any COVID-19-related symptoms in the past had the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, indicating asymptomatic seroconversion among the general population in India.Seroconversion was also documented among individuals without a history of known contact with a COVID-19 case, and among those without any prior SARS-CoV-2 testing.“Our data supports the expansion of testing strategies to include individuals without having known exposure or symptoms. We found only 3 per cent of seropositive individuals reported COVID-19 symptoms highlighting the limitations of symptom directed testing and the importance of universal prevention methods,” the report stated.“Nearly one in 15 individuals aged 10 years and above had SARS-CoV-2 infection by August 2020. The adult seroprevalence increased ten times between May and August 2020. Lower infection to case ratio in August compared to May reflects a substantial increase in testing across the country,” the findings stated.Also, 26–32 infections were reported per case diagnosed in August 2020 as against 82-131 in May 2020, when the first round of serosurvey was conducted, underlining the consequence of the growth of testing outpacing the growth of infections. The seroprevalence was higher in slum areas of Mumbai (57·8 per cent) compared to non-slum areas (17·4 per cent).While population density coupled with high mobility, and challenges in safe distancing and hand hygiene are the main drivers of spread of infection in urban areas, especially urban slums, the findings of the serosurvey also indicate substantial transmission among the rural population now, in contrast to the first round, the report stated.“Transmission will increase further in these rural areas in the coming months, underscoring the need for implementing nonpharmaceutical interventions as well as strengthening healthcare facilities for the effective management of cases,” it said.Of the 29,082 individuals tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, 3,135 tested positive, with an unweighted seroprevalence of 10·8 per cent.Of the 29,082 people (aged 10 and above) surveyed from August 17 to September 22, 6.6 per cent showed evidence of past exposure to COVID-19 while the seroprevalence among adults was 7·1 per cent.The seroprevalence was similar across age groups, sex, and occupation, the report said    The IgG positivity across districts ranged between 0·5 per cent (Palakkad in Kerala, Kullu in Himachal Pradesh), and 42·5 per cent (Ganjam in Odisha).The study indicate that the seroprevalence among adults has increased by about ten-fold, from 0·73 per cent in May 2020 to 7·1 per cent during August 2020. All 70 districts showed a rise in IgG seropsitivity between the two surveys, although the change is highly variable. While the study is not powered to provide reliable district-level estimates, some of the variations observed matches known context. For example, the largest increase was recorded from Ganjam district which is also reporting the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Odisha state subsequent to migration of inter- and intra-state informal workers, and challenges in facility-based quarantine.Inter-state migration of informal workers is also thought to explain the substantial rise in seroprevalence in all six districts in Bihar, and Kamrup Metropolitan district in Assam.The first nationwide serosurvey in India was conducted in May, when the entire country was under stringent lockdown, with the exception of conditional relaxation in areas deemed to be minimally affected, and indicated a low prevalence of 0·73 per cent among the general adult population.The second household serosurvey was conducted among individuals aged 10 years and above in the same 700 villages and wards from 70 districts selected during the first serosurvey. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-had-estimated-74-million-covid-19-infections-by-august-icmrs-2nd-serosurvey-176254
26-11-2020||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Professor held for bribery, sexual harassment||A medical college professor has been arrested by the Gujarat Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on the charges of sexual harassment and demanding bribe from junior teachers for favourable appraisal.The accused, Dr SK Nagar, is a Class-1 state government employee and currently serves as a professor with the state-run MP Shah Medical College in Jamnagar, the ACB said in a release on Thursday.He had earlier served as the head of the anatomy department with Vadodara Medical College, it added.The ACB has arrested Nagar under section 354 (a) of the IPC, which deals with sexual harassment, and under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.When he was with Vadodara Medical College some time back, the state Health and Family Welfare Department had received an application from a woman faculty member against Nagar, it said.In her application, the junior medical teacher claimed Nagar has demanded Rs 1.5 lakh for writing a favourable confidential report about her. She also alleged that Nagar had a habit of passing lewd remarks.She also attached an audio-video evidence to prove her claim, the ACB said.For further investigation, the health department forwarded the matter to the ACB, which found substance in the allegation of bribery and sexual harassment levelled against him by the complainant and some other woman applicants, it added.A forensic analysis of audio and video footage confirmed its authenticity, the ACB said.Nagar had earlier served in medical colleges of Surat, Ahmedabad and Patan.A detailed investigation by the ACB also revealed that he was involved in sexual harassment of female teachers as well as medical students in the past too.

Later, the top court had stayed the NGT order.An FIR was lodged in UP and the company moved the high court seeking its quashing. While refusing to quash the FIR, the Allahabad High Court had protected the company officials from arrest during the probe, if they co-operated with the investigation and appeared as and when called upon for questioning.The company had contended that the fine imposed on it by the NGT had been stayed by the Supreme Court and the new FIR was also based on similar allegations the top court was seized of.“As a matter of fact, the High Court has been fair to the petitioner, by granting protection against arrest till the filing of the report under section 173(2) of the Code. We do not think that the petitioner can ask for anything more,” the Bench noted while dismissing the company’s plea.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/emission-cheat-devices-sc-refuses-to-quash-fir-against-skoda-volkswagen-176247
26-11-2020||New Delhi||Waste fishing gear threatens Ganges wildlife: Study||Researchers have found that waste fishing gear in Ganges poses a serious threat to wildlife, including otters, turtles and dolphins.The study, published in the journal 'Science of the Total Environment', said that entanglement in fishing gear could harm species, including the critically endangered three-striped roofed turtle and the Ganges river dolphin.Surveys along the length of the river, from the mouth in Bangladesh to the Himalayas in India, show that levels of waste fishing gear are highest near to the sea.Fishing nets – all made of plastic – were the most common type of gear found.Interviews with local fishers revealed high rates of fishing equipment being discarded in the river – driven by short gear lifespans and lack of appropriate disposal systems.The study, led by researchers from the University of Exeter in the UK, with an international team including researchers from India and Bangladesh, was conducted as part of the National Geographic Society's "Sea to Source: Ganges" expedition."The Ganges River supports some of the world's largest inland fisheries, but no research has been done to assess plastic pollution from this industry, and its impacts on wildlife," said study author Sarah Nelms from Exeter."Ingesting plastic can harm wildlife, but our threat assessment focussed on entanglement, which is known to injure and kill a wide range of marine species," Nelms added.The researchers used a list of 21 river species of "conservation concern" identified by the Wildlife Institute for India.They combined existing information on entanglements of similar species worldwide with the new data on levels of waste fishing gear in the Ganges to estimate which species are most at risk.Speaking about the why so much fishing gear was found in the river, Nelms said: "There is no system for fishers to recycle their nets. Most fishers told us they mend and repurpose nets if they can, but if they can't do that the nets are often discarded  in the river.""Many held the view that the river 'cleans it away', so one useful step would be to raise awareness of the real environmental impacts," Nelms added.The researchers noted that this is a complex problem that will require multiple solutions – all of which must work for both local communities and wildlife.

The Constitution should be amended for this purpose, he added.The four Courts of Appeal with 15 Judges each sitting in four parts of India would reduce the burden of the Supreme Court, the Attorney General said in virtual presence of President Ram Nath Kovind, CJI SA Bobde, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, senior judges and bar members.He pointed out that at present the Supreme Court was hearing 400 different categories of cases, including matrimonial matters, landlord-tenant disputes, bails, matters and land acquisition cases, which the apex court of other countries don’t even touch. Because of this, there were arrears even in criminal matters, he added.“Now, we can start with a clean slate and the Supreme Court as the apex constitutional court of the country should be burdened with only constitutional cases. Then, as against the 75,000 cases at present, it would have to cater to only 2,000 to 3,000 cases per year,” Venugopal said.He said similar system of Court of Appeal was already functional in 20 to 25 common law countries. “Such a Court of Appeal shall hear the matter finally and there should be no further appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court. The judges of the court of appeal shall be of the same calibre as Supreme Court judges and shall be selected in the same manner as the Supreme Court judges by the collegium,” the Attorney General said.Citing a research done by a scholar from Yale University, he said the majority of cases filed in the Supreme Court came from the northern states, and Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and the other southern states accounted for only 1% to 2% of the litigation.“This is on account of distance and the difficulty in engaging a counsel...so to ensure access of justice to all equally, it would be desirable to have four Benches of the Court of Appeal, with 15 judges each, sitting across the country,” Venugopal suggested.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/set-up-four-courts-of-appeal-make-sc-constitutional-court-ag-176244
26-11-2020||New Delhi||AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine safe, Indian trials progressing smoothly: Serum Institute||Vaccine major Serum Institute of India on Thursday said the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University is safe and effective, and the Indian trials are progressing smoothly with strict adherence to all protocols.The comments came after AstraZeneca and Oxford University acknowledged a manufacturing error that is raising questions about preliminary results of their experimental COVID-19 vaccine.A statement describing the error came days after the company and the university described the shots as "highly effective" and made no mention of why some study participants did not receive as much vaccine in the first of two shots as expected.Asking people to be patient and not panic, the Serum Institute of India (SII) said in a statement, "The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is safe and effective. Even the lowest efficacy results are at 60-70%, making it a viable vaccine against the virus."That said, varied age groups with different dosage forms will result in slight variations and efficacy. "We must be patient and not panic," it added.SII is conducting clinical trials of AstraZeneca-Oxford's COVID-19 vaccine candidate in India."The Indian trials are running smoothly with strict adherence to all the necessary processes and protocols. So far, there are no concerns. However, we are going through the data that is available and will make further statement, if needed," SII said.Earlier this week, AstraZeneca said an interim analysis of clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine in the UK and Brazil showed that it was 70 per cent effective on average, becoming the third drugmaker to announce promising results to contain the deadly virus.The company had also said that the vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford, showed 90 per cent efficacy in one dosing regimen when the vaccine was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least a month later, while another dosing regimen showed 62 per cent efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart."The combined analysis from both dosing regimens resulted in an average efficacy of 70 per cent," it had said.

What were zero duty exports now attract one to seven per cent cess on the top 15 GSP items.India’s walk out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Cooperation (RCEP) partnership signed between 15 countries will come in useful in parrying US demands for accommodation in agricultural trade, removal of price controls on high-end medical devices and lower tariffs in industrial sectors, said sources.India had abstained from signing the pact on fears that agricultural and dairy products will flood the domestic market. It also had reservations on lowering tariffs due to the Atmanirbhar Bharat policy and lax rules of origin that could benefit China.For a return to the GSP arrangement, India could instead reduce the retaliatory tariff it had imposed on US exports of nuts, apples and chemicals, said sources here.These measures could also see both sides rolling back retaliatory tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminum. The US had first imposed these tariffs on several countries, including India.New Delhi will point out that while many countries, including China, had retaliated immediately, India had waited for a year before imposing matching tariffs.Though the presumptive Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Secretary of Defence Michele Flournoy have close ties to the American military-industrial complex, the Indian expectation is they could be sympathetic to India sourcing its defence requirements from Russia.A law, Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), was passed with bipartisan support to penalise countries purchasing military hardware from India. Trump had acted under the law only against China but not against India and Turkey, which have contracted for the Russian air defence system S-400.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-seek-end-of-trade-wars-with-us-176237

This road construction will use 35 metric tons of plastic waste,” Noida Authority CEO Ritu Maheshwari tweeted. The Authority’s General Manager Rajeev Tyagi said the road stretch is coming up on a service lane in Sector 129 along the Noida-Greater Noida expressway.The stretch to be developed is 500 metres long and 12 metres wide, he said.For construction, a module (a square block) made from plastic waste has been used, he said. Sheets of plastic modules are being laid on the stretch which will then be covered by two layers of bitumen measuring 40 mm and 50 mm, respectively, he added. “About 35 tonnes of plastic waste has been utilised in this R&D (research and development) trial. The performance of this road will be monitored and if found satisfactory the stretch will be scaled up to next level,” Tyagi said. He said the success of this concept may help in addressing the issues of plastic waste. “In entire India, it is the first time that modules made of plastic waste are being used for construction of road and this is happening in Noida,” he claimed.

26-11-2020||New Delhi||Over 1.4 crore cashless treatments provided to poor under Ayushman Bharat: Harsh Vardhan||More than 1.4 crore cashless treatments worth over Rs 17,500 crore have been provided to poor citizens under central government's Ayushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (AB-PMJAY) till date, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Thursday.Vardhan visited the National Health Authority (NHA) to conduct a high-level review of the implementation of the flagship health protection mission and the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM), a Health Ministry statement said.The health minister also interacted with several officials as part of the review.According to the statement, 14 hospital admissions are being registered per minute under the scheme and 24,653 hospitals (public: private = 54:46) have been empanelled."The National Digital Health Mission was launched under the visionary leadership of our prime minister to expand access to timely, affordable, safe healthcare for all 1.3 billion citizens, wherever they are and whenever they need.  "The NDHM will digitalize healthcare by creating a countrywide digital health ecosystem that will enable patients to store, access and consent to share their health records with doctors and health facilities of their choice," Vardhan was quoted as saying in the statement.The minister was given a full demo of the key systems of NDHM -- HealthID, DigiDoctor, Health Facility Registry, eHospital, Patient Health Records and Consent Manager -- by National Health Authority (NHA) CEO Indu Bhushan in the presence of senior officers of the NHA."Today, I reviewed NDHM and I am happy to note that in just a little over three months, the mission has made notable progress in its pilot in the six Union Territories of Andaman and Nicobar, Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Ladakh, Lakshadweep and Puducherry. It will soon be ready for a national rollout," Vardhan said.Held a meeting with officials of @AyushmanNHA to review the progress of #Ayushmanbharat PM-JAY & National Digital Health Mission.Pleased to share that over 1.4 cr cashless treatments worth Rs 17,500 cr have been provided to the poorest citizens under the scheme.@MoHFW_INDIA pic.twitter.com/2PGTOhDkTr  "From the point of view of both the citizen and the medical practitioner, the mission is privacy and security-led and it will enable consent-based sharing of health information in the form of test reports, scans, prescriptions and diagnosis reports between patients and medicos, thereby making follow-up care seamless, secure and timely," he said.Vardhan said that one of the most remarkable aspects of NDHM is that it takes into account the lived realities of Indians across the digital divide.  The NDHM will empower millions of citizens without smartphones or those in remote tribal areas facing connectivity issues to still avail healthcare through its offline modules, he said, according to the statement.The NDHM is a mission to harness technology to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of healthcare delivery in India, through better access to healthcare data.  A national digital health ecosystem will be created through the provision of a wide range of data, information and infrastructure services, duly leveraging open, interoperable, standards-based digital systems, while ensuring the security, confidentiality and privacy of health-related personal information.  The NDHM seeks to create a national digital health infrastructure starting with the building of health IDs, unique identifiers for doctors and health facilities, personal health records, and telemedicine and e-pharmacy, among other components.Reviewing the implementation of AB-PMJAY, which completed two years on September 23 this year, Vardhan said, "In these unprecedented times, I am pleased to know that more than 1.4 crore cashless treatments worth over Rs 17,500 crore have been provided to the poorest citizens under the scheme." During the height of the pandemic, Government of India has been careful to not lose focus from critical illnesses and it has ensured that all those needing essential healthcare have been provided the same, he said, adding this resulted in savings of nearly Rs 35,000 crore to the people."We understand that this health assurance and its delivery is a huge source of support and security for millions of families reeling under the extreme stress of serious illnesses amidst this pandemic," he was quoted as saying in the statement.The AB-PMJAY is the government's flagship scheme that provides a cover of up to Rs 5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care hospitalization to over 10.74 crore vulnerable entitled families (approximately 50 crore beneficiaries). It provides cashless and paperless access to services for the beneficiary at the point of service.The scheme covers 1,592 procedures under various health benefit packages with defined rates. Over 24,000 hospitals and health facilities providers have been empanelled across the country to provide healthcare services to the beneficiaries.

Preceding Jaishankar’s visit, India had sent aid to Seychelles to combat the Covid pandemic.It had earlier smoothened the way for taking on lease an island by undertaking four infrastructure projects – the Attorney General’s office, the secretariat building, police headquarters and a convention centre.In Nepal, Shringla opened his engagement with Covid aid in a meeting with Foreign Secretary Bharat Raj Paudyal. He then called on PM KP Oli in a continuing reset of the relationship that was facilitated by earlier visits by RAW chief Samant Goel and Indian Army Chief General MM Naravane.Nepal had wanted Foreign Secretary level talks much earlier but India preferred other ice-breaking gestures and visits to precede the interaction.Oli has sacked his Defence Minister who had raised temperatures on a land dispute with India. He also put on hold printing of text books with a new map incorporating areas on which Nepal recently laid claim.Shringla said his undertaking would be to perceive how the relationship could be taken forward. “We went through a very large number of issues of bilateral cooperation,” he said after calling on Oli in Kathmandu.“We both agreed on various steps to advance some of the areas of the cooperation,” Shringla noted after meeting his counterpart Paudyal.In Colombo, Doval will revive a trilateral interaction on defence cooperation at a two-day meeting from Thursday with Sri Lankan Defence Secretary Maj Gen (Retd) Kamal Gunaratne and Maldives Defence Minister Mariya Didi.Such interaction is being held by the Modi government after six years. The UPA government had initiated this format, which led to cooperation on maritime surveillance and domain awareness about the south-western Indian Ocean by sharing radar coverage.Significantly, Colombo was lukewarm to a visit by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with PM Mahinda Rajapaksa correcting him by stating that Sri Lanka was not in a debt trap due to Chinese projects. On the other hand, Maldives has been receptive to the US offer for defence cooperation.In the last such trilateral interaction, India had invited Mauritius and Seychelles as guest countries. The NSA is also expected to have other high level bilateral engagements, including with the Rajapaksas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-firms-up-ties-in-neighbourhood-with-high-level-visits-176224
26-11-2020||---||Agriculture Minister Tomar invites farmers for talks||New Delhi, November 26Amid palpable tension in the National Capital Region over farmers ‘Dilli Chalo’ resolve, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday again blamed the agitation on “politics” and invited farmers for talks, assuring a “positive outcome”.  Meanwhile, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha and All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) said “more than 50,000 farmers will be standing at the Delhi border by today evening”. “The numbers are expected to swell through the night as thousands of tractors and trolleys are carrying farmers, women and children from interior areas of Punjab,” a statement by farmers’ coordination body said.As farmers from Punjab marched to Delhi to protest the Centre’s three agriculture acts, Tomar appealed to them to not agitate and come for talks on December 3 to resolves differences. “I want to appeal to our farmer brothers to not agitate. We are ready to talk about issues and resolve differences. I am sure that our dialogue will have a positive result. “The new farm laws are the need of the hour. In the coming time, they are going to bring revolutionary changes. We have spoken at the secretary level in Punjab to dispel wrong notions of our farmer brothers there.

26-11-2020||New Delhi||Cost top most hurdle in improving access to justice for all: Ram Nath Kovind||Cost is the “top most” hurdle in improving “access to justice for all”, President Ram Nath Kovind said on Thursday, even as he commended the judiciary and the bar for not letting the coronavirus pandemic come in the way of fulfilling the duty of securing justice for the citizens.Speaking at the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, Kovind said he was happy to see that the apex court had continued to function and dispense justice amid the pandemic, using technological solutions like video-conferencing and e-filing."I am pleased that the higher judiciary has started making available its judgments in more and more regional languages. This is surely the best way to keep more and more citizens in the loop, and thus bringing the institution of judiciary closer to the citizenry at large," said Kovind.Union Law, IT and Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad congratulated the judiciary for rising to the occasion and continuing its work despite great inhibiting circumstances during the pandemic.He expressed unhappiness over unleashing of criticism of the apex court for its judicial functions and asked the people not to use expressions like "judicial barbarism" in criticising judgments or orders.Chief Justice SA Bobde said the judiciary had worked hard through the pandemic and it was committed to ensuring access of justice was maintained for all the citizens.The Indian Supreme Court has fared far better than the courts of other countries, he said.Attorney General KK Venugopal suggested that there should be four intermediate courts of appeal with 15 judges each in the four corners of the country for ensuring access to justice by all.

It is growing at the fastest speed among all major countries,” he said.Renewable energy capacity will rise to 220 GW by 2022 from the current 136 Giga Watts (GW), he added.Renewable energy capacity at present is about 36 per cent of India’s total electricity generating capacity.Modi said that after the success of Production Linked Incentives (PLI) in electronics manufacturing, “we have decided to give similar incentives to high-efficiency solar modules”.He, however, did not elaborate.Stating that ensuring ‘ease of doing business’ was the utmost priority, he said a dedicated project development cell has been established to facilitate investors.“In the last six years, we increased our installed renewable energy capacity by two and half times,” he said. “Our annual renewable energy capacity addition has been exceeding that of coal-based thermal power since 2017.”                 Even when it was not affordable, investments were made in renewable energy. Now, investments and scale are bringing costs down, he said.Noting that in the last six years, India has been travelling on an unparalleled journey, Modi said, “we are expanding our generation capacity and network to ensure every citizen of India has access to electricity to unlock his full potential”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-offer-incentives-for-solar-modules-pm-modi-176211

Owaisi was responding to these allegations.Bandi Sanjay had also said that it the BJP wins the Mayor’s post in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal (GHMC) elections, the party would do a “surgical strike” in the Old City (a Muslim-dominated area) and kick out the Rohingyas and Pakistanis.  Owaisi said, “I have only one question for the BJP, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. For the past six and half years, you are governing the country, and from Secunderabad, your party member is an MP and he is the Minister of State for Home Affairs. If there are Pakistanis and Rohingyas in Hyderabad, what has your minister been doing for the past one and half year?“Was the MoS Home Affairs sleeping? Didn’t he know that there are Rohingyas here?” Owaisi questioned, challenging the claims of the BJP. He said that the BJP was trying to flare up communal tension and trying to win elections by spreading hatred and dividing Hindus and Muslims, who enjoy equal status in the Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/owaisi-reacts-to-bjps-allegations-on-pakistani-rohingya-muslims-living-in-hyderabad-seeks-union-ministers-resignation-176210

26-11-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Entire Delhi can be vaccinated in a month, says State Immunization Officer||Delhi is geared up for the COVID-19 vaccination programme and the city's entire population can be covered in a month if hospital staff and nurses are involved, State Immunization Officer Suresh Seth said Thursday."We have 600 cold storage points and around 1,800 outreach sites for the universal immunization programme for children. We have sufficient equipment for vaccines that can be stored at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius and those that need minus 15 to minus 25 degrees Celsius. The central government is further strengthening the infrastructure and providing more equipment," Seth told PTI.He said the equipment and infrastructure for vaccines that need ultra-cold conditions (minus 70 degrees Celsius) are not there, but "we don't think there will be any problem logistically because the immunization programme will be carried out in a phased manner"."If we involve hospital staff and nurses etc., we can easily vaccinate the entire population in a month," he said, adding that at present, the Delhi government is collecting data of health care workers who are at top of the priority list of the Delhi government."If a vaccine is available, we can administer it to all healthcare workers in just three days... We have sufficient equipment and cold storage space, we are geared up. We won't let Delhi falter," Seth stressed.On their part, experts said that Delhi has sufficient infrastructure and equipment to effectively cover its entire population.Dr Ajit Jain, the nodal officer for COVID-19 at Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital, said, "Being the national capital, it has got the equipment and capacity. All we need is trained manpower to carry out the immunization programme effectively." The extreme low temperature of minus 70 degrees Celsius required for storing a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer poses a big challenge for its delivery in a developing nation like India, especially in its smaller towns and rural areas where maintaining such cold chain facilities would be very difficult, experts have said.However, drugmaker Moderna says its vaccine candidate is stable at regular freezer temperature - minus 20 degrees Celsius - for up to six months, and after thawing it can last in the refrigerator for 30 days. It can also be kept at room temperature for up to 12 hours.Also, the vaccine developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca "can be easily administered in existing healthcare systems, stored at 'fridge temperature' and distributed using existing logistics", according to Oxford University.Most vaccines in India need to be stored at a temperature of two to eight degrees Celsius. The lowest minimum temperature at which vaccines can be kept to maintain the cold chain in most areas in the country is minus 25 degrees Celsius, AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria had said recently.N K Ganguly, former Director General of Indian Council of Medical Research, said there is "enough infrastructure" available across the country to store a Covid-19 vaccine at a temperature of two to eight degrees Celsius."We have a enough number of refrigerated vans to transport the vaccine from one place to another,” he said."There is only one vaccine in India - the Rotavirus vaccine from Bharat Biotech - that needs to be stored at minus 20 degrees Celsius. The company has made arrangements for its storage and transport. We don't have the equipment and infrastructure for anything that needs to be stored below this temperature," he pointed out.The vaccine by Pfizer is not made for developing countries like India. "It is priced at USD 1,500. In India, the price should be below Rs 500," he said."In Delhi, there will be no problem in terms of storage and distribution if a Covid-19 vaccine needs to be stored at a temperature of two to eight degrees Celsius," Ganguly said.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had last week said there should not be "VIP or non-VIP categories" for vaccinating people against COVID-19 as everyone's life is important and priority should instead be given to "corona warriors", vulnerable groups such as senior citizens, and those having comorbidities.He had also said that it was likely that the distribution plan of the vaccination will be prepared by the central government, but he would prefer "priority-based" vaccination which is "technical rather than political in nature"."First priority should be given to corona warriors as they are working hard during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Second priority should be given to those who are vulnerable groups like senior citizens and then those who have comorbidities," he had said.

26-11-2020||New Delhi||India poised to play leading role in global arena in post-COVID-19 era: Jitendra Singh||India is in a position to play a leading role in the global arena not only in the healthcare sector, but also in building the post-COVID economy, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said on Thursday.The nation has shown remarkable resilience, and its ability to rise to the occasion at a short notice, reorienting itself to the crisis has demonstrated the underlying scientific temperament, innovative thinking and strength of its medical fraternity, he said while speaking at a Ficci event.“...it’s not a simple coincidence that when we started off into this pandemic...we were short of ventilators, PPE kits and now we are in a position to export these items.“So, that itself is a reflection of our scientific fraternity — in this case, of course, the medical fraternity — rising to the occasion at a short notice, and re-orienting ourselves to a crisis, which was actually alien to the entire world, including in the medical fraternity,” Singh said addressing the ‘Global R&D Summit 2020’ organised by industry body Ficci.India is in a position to take a “leading role” in the global arena in the post COVID times, not only in the healthcare but also in the building of the post-pandemic economy, said Singh, who is the Minister of State (Independent Charge), Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space.Speaking at the virtual event, Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal noted that telecom has become the “backbone” for India and businesses, playing a critical role in all aspects — right from ensuring the seamless functioning of payment systems to work-from-home, and from ensuring remote access to quality healthcare to enabling online education for children.The industry is “uniquely positioned” to deliver major productivity benefits for the economy and businesses through digital technology, science and partnerships.“One of the most critical enablers for Digital India is improved access to infrastructure, affordable and easy access to Right of Way, so we can lay out fibre when needed, affordable spectrum...so we can invest in building networks rather than spend money on just airwaves, and finally stable and long term policies to encourage more investments with lesser risks,” Vittal said.Tech Mahindra Managing Director and CEO C P Gurnani said the Indian private sector has tried to explore how — with limited R&D spends — it can still continue to innovate without always turning to ‘Jugaad’ that sometimes has a negative connotation.He also lauded the government for the continued focus on innovation in areas like healthcare and agriculture even amid the pandemic.“...whether we follow the money, technology or innovation, if the government and private sector can work together, I think there is a huge headroom and we are looking for support,” he said, citing the example of space-tech that the government has been promoting through various efforts.Gurnani said citizens have benefitted immensely from the one-way communication (via satellites), and added that with the advent of low-orbit satellites and some of the newer technologies, “two-way communication is a possibility”.“...we would like to collaborate and make us the leaders in space technologies, make us leaders in space communication...(so that) we are able to marry some of the technologies that already exist in this country,” Gurnani said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-poised-to-play-leading-role-in-global-arena-in-post-covid-19-era-jitendra-singh-176185
26-11-2020||New Delhi||Deadly third wave of COVID-19 in Delhi is far from over: Doctors||As the national capital is battling a resurgence in Covid-19 cases, health experts on Thursday said that Delhi is currently facing the third wave of the disease which is likely to last at least a few more weeks.Although the last week offered some signs of slowdown in fresh Covid cases in Delhi compared to the previous five weeks, the resurgence cannot be said to be over yet, according to doctors.There is, however, no unanimity among them about when the curve will flatten.According to Dr Ajay Aggarwal, Director, Internal medicine, Fortis Hospital in Noida, the second wave of Covid-19 ended in October and the third wave started around mid-November and is likely to end in mid-January and post that."Third Covid-19 wave has more respiratory symptoms and patients are coming with severe breathlessness and decreased saturation," Aggarwal told IANS."We are expecting a surge in post-Covid complications like lung fibrosis in patients who had severe disease, post-Covid depression and chronic fatigue syndromes," he stressed.Until Wednesday evening, Delhi had reported 545,787 cases and 8,720 deaths. Currently, there are 38,287 active cases.The national capital has recorded 5,246 fresh Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours with 99 more fatalities.Dr Arun Kumar P, Consultant - General Medicine, Apollo TeleHealth told IANS: "The first wave hit the country in the months of May-June. The second wave started in the month of September and ended around October 10"."The third wave which started in the first week of November has already passed its peak, and we are expecting that within the next couple of weeks the third wave will pass."If the smog condition in Delhi doesn't worsen further over the coming few weeks, hopefully, we will witness the end of the 3rd wave by next a couple of weeks," he said."October-November are also the months when common flu is at its peak. So, apart from Covid cases, people are also experiencing common cold and cough that comes with the changing seasons."According to Dr Navneet Sood, Pulmonary Consultant, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital in New Delhi, considering the winters which unfortunately add to the viral diseases and respiratory issues, now it is even harder to say till when this situation will continue."We have witnessed patients losing lives but still some people can be seen accepting it as the normal flu, and this flawed understanding is far more dangerous than Covid itself," Sood said.

26-11-2020||Lahore||Pakistan fails to nab 19 most wanted Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists even 12 years after 26/11 attack||Twelve years after the 26/11 attack, Pakistan has placed 19 members of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in a list of the "Most Wanted Terrorists" for their role in the heinous assault, but it has not initiated any serious efforts to nab them and also punish seven others who are facing trial here.The security agencies here are clueless about the whereabouts of these 19 most wanted terrorists. Some of them have been hiding in Pakistan and others are believed to have fled the country. These terrorists were either crew members of the boats used by the attackers or financiers of the 26/11 attack.The move to place 19 LeT terrorists on the list apparently came following the Paris-based global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog's recent decision to retain Pakistan on its grey list till February 2021.The Financial Action Task Force made the decision after Islamabad failed to fulfill its six key obligations, including failure to take action against two of India's most wanted terrorists – Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed and Jaish-e-Mohammed head Masood Azhar.The security agencies have prepared a list of over 1,200 most wanted/high profile terrorists in Pakistan to enable more coordination among authorities to go after them, officials from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) told PTI.The FIA, Pakistan's top investigating agency, has been probing the Mumbai terror attack case since 2009 and is looking for the 19 "most wanted terrorists" involved in the deadly terror assault that sent shockwaves across the country and even brought India and Pakistan to the brink of a war.In November 2008, 10 LeT terrorists sailed into Mumbai from Karachi and carried out coordinated attacks, killing 166 people and injuring over 300. Nine of the attackers were killed by police while lone survivor Ajmal Kasab was caught and hanged after trial in India.On the 12th anniversary of the Mumbai terror attack, its mastermind Saeed is in jail in Lahore, serving a collective over 21-year sentence under terror financing charges.Saeed, a UN designated terrorist whom the US has placed a USD 10 million bounty on, was arrested on July 17 last year. Saeed-led JuD is the front organisation for the LeT.And the LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi has been operating with impunity in the country after securing bail in the Mumbai terror attack case over five years ago.The 26/11 case has been pending in the anti-terrorism courts of Rawalpindi/Islamabad since 2009.The other six accused—Abdul Wajid, Mazhar Iqbal, Hamad Amin Sadiq, Shahid Jamil Riaz, Jamil Ahmed and Younis Anjum—who are facing charges of abetment to murder, attempted murder, planning and executing the Mumbai attack, are lodged at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.The Pakistan government says it has recently introduced a number of fresh legislations to enable security forces to confront terrorist groups more effectively.Making the information about the 19 most wanted LeT terrorists public for the first time, the FIA says Amjad Khan of Multan was a crew member of LeT (boat Al-Hussaini and boat Al-Fauz).“He also purchased the boat Al Fauz which was used during the Mumbai terror attacks. He also purchased a Yamaha motor-boat engine, life jackets, inflatable boats etc. From ARZ Water Sport Karachi these things were used in Mumbai terror attacks and recovered by Indian authorities,” it says.Iftikhar Ali, a resident of Faisalabad, obtained Voice-over Internet Protocol (VOIP) connection for terrorist communication, it says.The FIA further says Shahid Ghafoor of Bahawalpur was a captain/Tandol of boats Al Hussaini & Al Fauz."Muhammad Usman of Sahiwal, Ateequer Rehman of Lahore, Riaz Ahmed of Hafizabad, Muhammad Mushtaq of Gujranwala, Muhammad Naeem of DG Khan, Abdul Shakoor of Karachi, Muhammad Sabir of Multan, Usman Bashir of Lodhran, Shakil Ahmed of Rahim Yar Khan and Abdul Rehman of Bawalnagar were crew members of boats Al Hussaini & Al Fouz used by the terrorists,” the FIA says.Giving details of the other most wanted LeT terrorists, the FIA says Usman Zia of Rawalpindi transferred Rs 80,000 in the account of accused Hammad Amin Sadiq and Shahid Jamil Riaz in ABL Karachi.Similarly, Abbas Nasir of Khanewal transferred Rs 2,53,690 in their account. Javed Iqbal of Kasur and Mukhtar Ahmed of Mandi Bahauddin transferred Rs 1,86,430 and Rs 2,98,047 respectively in Sadiq's account.The FIA says Ahmed Saeed of Bbatagram transferred Rs 21,00,000. Muhammad Khan of Turbat provided Al-Hussaini boat to the terrorists involved in the 26/11 attack.Talking to the PTI on the current status of the Mumbai attack case, FIA's chief prosecutor Chaudhry Azhar said: "The case proceedings have come to halt after India refused to send its 24 witnesses to Pakistan for recording of their statements and other evidence. The case cannot move further till India's cooperation on the issue."Practically, there have not been any proceedings in this case for the last two years or so. Neither the Imran Khan government intends to challenge the bail of Lakhvi in the Supreme Court.According to the FIA, the prosecution does not have strong enough evidence to challenge Lakhvi's bail.Neither Saeed nor any of his associates convicted in terror financing cases have applied for bail in superior court."Perhaps the convicted JuD men are told to wait for Pakistan coming out of the FATF's grey list before they move to court for bail,” a political analyst commented.

26-11-2020||New Delhi||India sees highest drop in work, social, household travels due to pandemic: Survey||Amid the global wave of COVID-19 in the past nine months, India saw the highest drop in work, social and household travels among nine countries, including China and the US, reflecting the disruptive changes brought about by the pandemic in the patterns of mobility across the world, according to survey consultancy firm EY.The changing mobility pattern has further raised pertinent questions about the nature and shape of cities and transport networks."Amid this health crisis, the consumer is heavily conflicted over mobility; not having to commute to work has given many a new sense of autonomy as well as a few hours of their time back every day," EY said in a statement.As far as India is concerned, the survey found that the country "witnessed the highest drop in work travel of nearly 69 per cent, followed almost parallelly by social travel that declined by 59 per cent and household travel that fell by 58 per cent"."The drops are substantial, as India which is the world's biggest democracy with a population of 138 crores, parallels the levels of the work-related decline of 70 per cent in a small country of Sweden with a population of only a crore," it added.EY said the decline can be attributed to the strict lockdown measures in India to control the pandemic, resulting in steep declines across travel segments."The survey results also indicate an overall reduction in average weekly travel time by 40 per cent from 6 hours to 3.7 hours per person," it added.EY India Partner and Automotive Sector Leader Vinay Raghunath said, "The change in mobility industry dynamics and consumer behaviour will push sector stakeholders to think through new operating models that leverage digital platforms and help ride the next wave of mobility growth." EY had conducted a survey, as part of the Mobility Consumer Index, this month with 3,300 consumers across nine countries, including India, China, the US and the UK, to explore the impact of COVID-19 on consumer attitudes and behaviour towards mobility. Five hundred respondents from India participated in the survey.Of the nine countries surveyed, EY said India and Singapore have witnessed the maximum decline in average weekly commute time."India felt the steepest decline of more than 5 hours, from 81 per cent to just 27 per cent, while in Singapore, it fell from 61 per cent to 19 per cent," it said.EY added that a long-term decline in commuting time could mean a lower peak demand and less strain on public transport systems and road networks.It also said, "This profuse reduction in the use of public transport and road networks brings forth a challenging situation for the trains, buses and subway operators that find it difficult to generate enough revenue to meet their operational costs." EY said one of the few positive impacts of the early days of the pandemic due to the lockdown was the sudden drop in air pollution in large cities."Emissions fell drastically, skies cleared and the residents of New York, London, Shanghai, Mumbai and other major metro cities that are usually traffic-clogged global cities enjoyed clean air for the first time in decades," it said.EY's analysis indicates that monthly per-capita emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) fell globally across all three travel segments, broadly tracking the decline in journey numbers already noted. Emissions fell substantially, by 56 per cent for work travel, 58 per cent for social and household travel and 62 per cent for leisure and entertainment, the statement said.EY India Partner (Automotive Sector) Som Kapoor said the changed scenario with regard to reduced emissions points towards the need for newer non-polluting mobility avenues like electric vehicles."Rightly directed efforts will certainly catapult the growth of this much-awaited mobility model," Kapoor added.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-sees-highest-drop-in-work-social-household-travels-due-to-pandemic-survey-176175

26-11-2020||Mumbai||High Court dismisses plea seeking CBI probe into Disha Salian's death||The Bombay High Court on Thursday dismissed a petition seeking a court-monitored CBI probe into the death of Disha Salian, former manager of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput, and said if any person has information in the case, he/she is free to approach police.A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni observed that the petitioner, Delhi-based advocate Puneet Dhanda, had no locus standi (capacity) to file such a plea."Who are you? If there is any foul play in the death of this person Disha Salian, then her family can take appropriate steps as per law," the court said.Salian, 28, died on June 8 this year after falling off the 14th floor of a residential building in suburban Malad, following which the the city police had registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR).In his petition, Dhanda had sought that the case of Disha Salian's death be transferred to the CBI and it is monitored by the high court.The HC, in its order dismissing the petition, said the Mumbai police on August 5 issued a press note, saying if any person has any information pertaining to the death of Disha Salian, then he or she shall approach the police."There is nothing on record to show that the petitioner has approached the police. The petitioner has, in fact, directly approached the Supreme Court," the court said.The apex court last month refused to hear the plea and directed Dhanda to approach the high court first, following which Dhanda filed a petition in the Bombay HC.The petitioner's advocate, Vineet Dhanda, argued that there were several media reports insinuating that she (Salian) was murdered and the police has closed the case without carrying out a proper inquiry."On June 8, Salian was found dead in mysterious circumstances and just a few days later, actor Sushant Singh Rajput, with whom Salian worked in the past, was also found dead at his residence under mysterious circumstances," Vineet Dhanda argued.The bench, however, said the petitioner can approach the police if he has any information.Rajput, 34, was found hanging at his home in suburban Bandra on June 14.

26-11-2020||Mumbai||Need strong police force to prevent terror attacks: Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday paid tributes to the martyrs of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack on its 12th anniversary and said the police force needed to be so strong that terrorists did not dare to attack the state or its capital city.Speaking at the Maharashtra Police headquarters here after paying floral tributes to the martyrs, Thackeray said though the state was facing a financial crisis, his government would take every step to strengthen the police force.Earlier, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh and Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray also paid respects to the martyrs, who died fighting terrorists during the attack on November 26, 2008, at the newly-built memorial at the police headquarters in south Mumbai.Wives of some of the personnel killed in the 26/11 attack inaugurated the martyrs’ gallery at the state police headquarters here.On the occasion, Thackeray released of coffee table book, titled ‘True Grit’ on the Maharashtra Police’s work during COVID-19 pandemic.“We should make our force so strong that the idea of attack on Maharashtra and Mumbai does not come into the mind of terrorists, they should not dare to attack the state and Mumbai. If any terrorist comes forward, he should be killed on the spot,” he said.“We woke up about strengthening the police force after the 26/11 terror attack. As we made necessary arrangements for health facilities after COVID-19 outbreak, we can also work to strengthen our police force,” he said.Thackeray remembered the day of the attack in 2008 when he was on a tour of Dhule and Nashik for poll rallies.“After getting information about the attack, I had called police inspector Vijay Salaskar and he said he had just reached home and was again rushing to the spot,” he recalled.“I then made two to three calls to him. When he picked up the call, Salaskar said he was in front of the Taj Mahal Hotel and that the police force will enter it after a survey,” the Chief Minister said.Salaskar was later killed while fighting with the terrorists.“Later, I made various calls to Salakar, and till this day, he hasn’t picked up the call,” the CM said on an emotional note.“When I reached Nashik, I got the shocking news, which I could not have imagined,” he said, adding that the scars of the deadly attack were “irreparable”.People should be aware of what conditions police personnel were working in, what was the meaning of police, what is their life, he said, adding the concept of martyrs gallery should also be extended to other major cities of the state.On the occasion, state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the 26/11 terror attack was a “national crisis”.“The black face of the neighbouring country (Pakistan) came to light after the police caught one of the terrorists (Ajmal Kasab) alive,” he added.At least 797 Maharashtra Police personnel have died in various operations, including Naxal attacks, terror attacks, communal riots, and other official duties from 1965 to 2020, according to the state police.The 12th anniversary of the deadly terror attack was attended by a limited number of people in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.Family members of some of the martyred police personnel also paid tributes at the memorial.During the ceremony, the Governor, the Chief Minister and the Home Minister met family members of some martyrs.“Their sacrifice will never be erased from the memory of time and history. Today, we pay tribute to our saviours #2611Attack #2611Martyrs,” Mumbai Police tweeted.Remembering their personnel killed in the attack, the Maharashtra Police in a tweet said: “A tribute to the ones who sacrificed their lives to safeguard the rest!”“Saluting the bravehearts whose sacrifice still ignites the spirits of millions #2611Attack #2611Martyrs #SalutingMartyrs,” Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh tweeted.NCP chief Sharad Pawar also paid tributes to the policemen and other security personnel who laid their lives during the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, and called for a resolve to intensify the fight against terrorism.“Tributes to martyrs from the police and other security forces who laid their lives in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. As we condole with the families who lost their near ones in the attack, we should (also) resolve to intensify our fight against terrorism,” the former Union minister tweeted.On November 26, 2008, 10 Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists from Pakistan arrived by sea route and opened fire, killing 166 people, including 18 security personnel, and injuring several others during the 60-hour siege in Mumbai.The then Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) chief Hemant Karkare, Army Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, Mumbai’s Additional Police Commissioner Ashok Kamte, Senior Police Inspector Vijay Salaskar and Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Tukaram Omble were among those killed in the attack.The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, the Oberoi Trident, the Taj Mahal Hotel, Leopold Cafe, Cama Hospital and the Nariman House Jewish community centre, now renamed Nariman Light House, were some of the places targeted by terrorists.Nine terrorists were later killed by the security forces, including the NSG, the country’s elite commando force.Ajmal Kasab was the only terrorist who was captured alive.

And on the epicentre of global terrorism,” he said in a tweet.Also read: Need strong police force to prevent terror attacks: Uddhav ThackerayPakistan must bring perpetrators of 26/11 terror attacks to justice: Consul Gen JaiswalIndia can never forget 26/11 Mumbai terror attack: ModiTributes paid to martyrs on 12th anniversary of 26/11 attackIsraelis pay respects to victims of 26/11 Mumbai attacks, demand justice for them26/11: US says it stands with India and remains resolute in fight against terrorismJaishankar is currently visiting the United Arab Emirates (UAE). He arrived here on Wednesday night on the second leg of his six-day three-nation tour to Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Seychelles, which began on Tuesday.The visit is seen as important as it comes in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic that has wreaked havoc across the world.“Twelve years since the horrific 26/11 #MumbaiTerrorAttacks. Pay my homage to its victims. Applaud the courage of our security forces, who continue to defend our nation so resolutely,” he said.On November 26, 2008, a group of 10 Pakistani terrorists went into a rampage, carrying out coordinated attacks on a railway station, two luxury hotels and a Jewish centre, after they sneaked into India's financial capital using the sea route in the Arabian sea.Over 166 people, including 28 foreigners from 10 nations, were killed in the nearly 60-hour assault that sent shock waves across the country and even brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war.In November 2012, Ajmal Amir Kasab, the lone surviving gunman among the Pakistani group, was hanged to death in Yerawada Jail in Pune.India has been pressing Pakistan to punish those involved in the dastardly attacks. But the trial of the accused, including Jamat-ud-Dawah (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, in the attacks has made little headway so far.Following the attacks, India has been consistently highlighting the threat of cross border terrorism and how Pakistan has been sheltering and providing support to various terror groups.

26-11-2020||New Delhi||India has highest bribery rate in Asia: Transparency International||India has the highest bribery rate in Asia and the most number of people who use personal connections to access public services, according to a new report by corruption watchdog Transparency International.The Global Corruption Barometer (GCB), Asia, found that nearly 50 per cent of those who paid bribes were asked to, while 32 per cent of those who used personal connections said they would not receive the service otherwise.The report is based upon the survey which was conducted between June 17 and July 17 this year in India with a sample size of 2,000.“With the highest bribery rate (39 per cent) in the region, India also has the highest rate of people using personal connections to access public services (46 per cent),” the report said.Bribery in public services continues to plague India. Slow and complicated bureaucratic process, unnecessary red tape and unclear regulatory frameworks force citizens to seek out alternate solutions to access basic services through networks of familiarity and petty corruption, the report said.“Both national and state governments need to streamline administrative processes for public services, implement preventative measures to combat bribery and nepotism, and invest in user-friendly online platforms to deliver essential public services quickly and effectively,” the report said.Although reporting cases of corruption was critical to curbing the spread, a majority of citizens in India (63 per cent) think that if they reported corruption, they would suffer retaliation, it said.In several countries, including India, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, sexual extortion rates are also high and more must be done to prevent sextortion and address specific-gendered forms of corruption, the report said.Sextortion is extorting money or sexual favours from someone by threatening to reveal evidence of their sexual activity through means like morphed images.In India, 89 per cent think government corruption is a big problem, 18 per cent offered bribes in exchange for votes and 11 per cent experienced sextortion or know someone who has.“About 63 per cent of surveyed people think the government is doing well in tackling corruption while 73 per cent said their anti-corruption agency is doing well in the fight against corruption,” it said.Based on fieldwork conducted in 17 countries, the GCB surveyed nearly 20,000 citizens in total.The report said the results showed that nearly three out of four people think corruption is a big problem in their country and the survey also found that nearly one in five people who accessed public services, such as health care and education, paid a bribe in the preceding year.This equates to approximately 836 million citizens in the 17 countries surveyed, it said.After India, Cambodia has the second-highest bribery rate at 37 per cent, followed by Indonesia (30 per cent) while the Maldives and Japan maintain the lowest overall bribery rate (2 per cent), followed by South Korea (10 per cent) and Nepal (12 per cent).“However, even in these countries, governments could do more to stop bribes for public services,” the report said.The report concluded by noting that daily experience with corruption and bribery remains alarmingly high, with nearly one in five citizens paying a bribe to access key government services, such as health care or education, and one in seven being offered a bribe to vote one way or another at elections.“In several countries, including India, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, sexual extortion rates are also high and more must be done to prevent sextortion and address specific-gendered forms of corruption,” it said.The report further said that to provide victims of corruption with channels for redress, governments must ensure that bribery was criminalised and actively investigated and prosecuted.“Citizens must have access to safe and confidential reporting mechanisms and governments must do more to ease citizens’ fear of retaliation in reporting corruption. Despite these challenges, citizens are largely optimistic about the future and believe that ordinary people can make a difference in the fight against corruption,” the report said.

26-11-2020||New York||Pakistan must bring perpetrators of 26/11 terror attacks to justice: Consul Gen Jaiswal||Perpetrators of the “ghastly” 26/11 Mumbai attacks must be brought to justice by Pakistan, India’s Consul General in New York Randhir Jaiswal said, emphasising that combating terrorism requires strong global cooperation as he, along with top Israeli diplomats, paid homage to the victims of the 2008 terror strike.November 26 marks the 12th anniversary of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai.“It is important for the world and the global community, for us and for justice that those responsible are brought to book. Pakistan must do what is required to bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice,” Jaiswal said, addressing a virtual commemoration event on Wednesday.Also read: Tributes paid to martyrs on 12th anniversary of 26/11 attack26/11: US says it stands with India and remains resolute in fight against terrorismIsraelis pay respects to victims of 26/11 Mumbai attacks, demand justice for themTen terrorists of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) carried out 12 coordinated shooting and bombing attacks lasting four days across Mumbai. At least 166 people, including six Jews and nine terrorists, were killed and over 300 others were injured in the attacks which began on November 26, 2008.At the event organised by The American India Public Affairs Committee and American Jewish Committee, Jaiswal described the 26/11 attacks as a “ghastly attack unknown in the annals of history”. He said terrorism is one of the greatest threats confronting the world.“As in the (time of) COVID19, the world has come together to fight this pandemic, we must all come together to fight terrorism, a global problem, tooth and nail. Let us remember on this occasion those who fell to the barbaric and bloody bullets of insanity and inhumanity. And those who sacrificed life to save our tomorrow, to save our today,” he said.Israel Nitzan, Acting Consul General of Israel in New York, said his country was “shocked” by the “barbaric terrorist attacks” carried out against innocent Indian civilians and foreign tourists across Mumbai in November 2008.He stressed that India, the US and Israel share democratic values and deep bonds based on shared experiences. “This horrific attack in Mumbai, with its tragic outcome, only strengthens us and strengthens our deep bond and friendship,” Nitzan said.Nitzan said India, the US and Israel knew what terrorism was all about and added that the objective of the attack in Mumbai, as well as attacks in New York and Israel, was to cripple the economy, society and its vivid and wonderful culture.“And they (terrorists) failed. The attack is also a lesson about our resiliency, that we will not allow terrorism to break us. Despite the devastating results of this attack, the Indian economy has continued to grow stronger, its society is resilient, its culture remains invincible,” and the relations with Israel grows stronger, he said.“We will not allow hate to prevail,” Nitzan said, adding that the presence of the Chabad House in Mumbai, which also came under attack on 26/11, is a testimony to the tolerance and the acceptance of other traditions, beliefs and the pluralism of Indian society.“The attack on the Chabad House, like other anti-Semitic attacks against Jews and Jewish institutions around the world, will not prevail. They will fail and terrorism will only push us to unite and to fight together against terrorism and hatred,” he said.Nitzan said Israel, India and the US have an “extraordinary cooperation” in counterterrorism and fighting hate and radicalism.“Hate only brings us together. Hate is actually leading us to strengthen our cooperation together in order not only to fight hatred but also to work to make this world a better place. We’re much stronger than hate,” he said.India’s Deputy Consul General Shatrughna Sinha said 12 years after the heinous attacks, “the perpetrators of this ghastly attack are still roaming free”.“Acts of terror not only violate the right of life of the individual who suffers these attacks. There are families whose rights are also violated. Unfortunately, victims of the attacks are also suffering today because their right to get justice has also been violated,” he said.Jaiswal said terrorism needs a very strong global cooperation and called on the international community to ensure that the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, which India sponsored at the United Nations, is adopted at the earliest.He stressed that in India’s international engagement with the United States and Israel, as well as with many countries, counterterrorism cooperation is an important element and New Delhi will continue to strengthen it.Sinha also shared profiles of a few individuals and foreign nationals who lost their lives in the Mumbai attacks. Among them were Rabbi Gavriel and his wife Rivka, who was five months pregnant at the time, who were killed when the Pakistani terrorists stormed Nariman House. The couple’s son Moshe Holtzberg was saved by his Indian caregiver Sandra Samuel.Prominent community leader and President of the American India Public Affairs Committee Jagdish Sewhani said Pakistan today was more isolated than ever. He asserted that the war against terrorism had to be won.Sewhani said the perpetrators of Mumbai terrorist attack continue to roam freely in Pakistan and called on the Jewish community to press upon the incoming Biden administration to not restore financial aid to Pakistan — the “epicentre of terrorism”.He expressed confidence that the Biden administration would continue to stand with India in the fight against terrorism and ensure there was zero tolerance towards terrorism.

26-11-2020||Shubhadeep Choudhury||CPM plays up its Maradona connection||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, November 26Successful Indian politicians normally do not like to be seen in the company of a cocaine user. However, Jyoti Basu had made an exception for Diego Maradona.A visit to the venerable CPI(M) patriarch’s residence by Maradona was arranged when the football legend visited Kolkata in 2008.“Jyotibabu” presented a photo album to Maradona containing pictures of the Argentine star’s good friend Fidel Castro in Kolkata taken during a visit by the Cuban revolutionary leader to the city in 1973. Later, while making an appearance at the Salt Lake Football Stadium here, Maradona happily displayed to the crowd a painting of Che Guevara presented to him by an artist in Kolkata.The West Bengal unit of CPI(M) on Tuesday posted on social media Maradona’s photo with late Jyoti Basu with the caption “the prince of football with the legendary mass leader”.“He had empathy for people’s struggles”, was inscribed on another social media post by the Bengal unit of CPI(M).Maradona visited Kolkata twice. During his first visit in 2008, the CPI(M)-led Left Front government was power in the state. This was when he met Jyoti Basu.The hero of the Argentinian victory in the 1986 football world cup came to Kolkata a second time in 2017. This time his host was Trinamool Congress minister Sujit Bose. During his second visit to the city Maradona unveiled a 12-feet bronze statue of himself in Lake Town.Maradona and Saumitra Chatterjee were like chalk and cheese. The former was a sportsman and the latter an actor. The former was a character off the field also. The latter seldom got himself entangled in any controversy. Both are immensely popular in Bengal with the Argentine football maestro in all likelihood having a wider fan base among the Bengalis than the thespian.After Saumitra’s recent death also, the Leftists resorted to sneakily playing up the actor’s alleged Left-wing sympathies. This was intended to be a counterweight to Mamata Banerjee who landed up in the hospital after Saumitra’s death and remained an overarching presence in organising the actor’s last journey.It is not immediately known why Mamata failed to get herself photographed with Maradona when he visited Kolkata three years back. More than 12 hours have passed since the news about Maradona’s death broke but Mamata has not posted anything on social media also on the legend’s passing away.The silence, despite the footballer’s huge popularity in her state, is found surprising by all those who closely follow Banerjee and the politics of West Bengal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cpm-plays-up-its-maradona-connection-176134
26-11-2020||Kathmandu||India, Nepal agree to advance ties as Foreign Secretary meets Nepalese top leadership||India and Nepal on Thursday agreed to step up efforts to advance mutual cooperation as Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla met the country’s top leadership and held “productive” talks with his Nepalese counterpart on a range of bilateral issues.Shringla was accorded a warm welcome on his maiden visit to Nepal at the invitation of Foreign Secretary Bharat Raj Paudyal, amid a strain in bilateral ties following a bitter border row between the two countries.He paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli at the latter’s official residence at Baluwatar, according to prime minister’s Press advisor Surya Thapa.Shringla also called on Nepal’s Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali and handed over 2,000 vials of anti-virus drug Remdesivir to him as part of India’s continuing assistance to the Himalayan nation to help it contain the COVID-19 pandemic.Earlier, the foreign secretary met his Nepalese counterpart and had a “very productive and useful exchange” with him. “FS @harshvshringla had a productive meeting with @PaudyalBR during which they took stock of bilateral cooperation and discussed issues of mutual interest,” the Indian embassy in Kathmandu said in a tweet.“Both sides appreciated the progress made on the numerous bilateral initiatives and projects. It was agreed to take further steps to advance mutual cooperation,” it said in another tweet.Speaking to the media, he said: “We had a very productive and useful exchange.” “The very large number of issues of bilateral cooperation that we went through, it shows the multi-faceted and comprehensive nature of our cooperation. We both agreed on various steps to advance some areas of cooperation, on very good progress on commitments made by the leadership and looking at some other initiatives that could happen,” he said.Nepal’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the two foreign secretaries discussed various aspects of bilateral relations.“Foreign Secretary @PaudyalBR held bilateral talks with Foreign Secretary of India @harshvshringla this afternoon covering various aspects of Nepal-India bilateral relations in a cordial manner,” the Foreign Ministry said in a tweet.While interacting with local journalists, Shringla said, “I have wanted to come here earlier also, but because of COVID-19 I couldn’t do so. I am very happy to be here. I was here in Kathmandu earlier too, though this is my first visit to Nepal as a Foreign Secretary. We have a very strong relationship. Our endeavour will be to see how we can take that relationship forward”.“I would like to thank the government of Nepal, the foreign secretary for the warm hospitality extended to us. We have some very good meetings ahead of us and we will look forward to how that goes,” he said.Shringla’s two-day visit will be a continuation of the regular exchange of high-level visits between the two friendly neighbours, the Nepalese Foreign Ministry said in a statement this week.On Friday, he will deliver a lecture on India-Nepal relations hosted by a think tank in Kathmandu and will inspect three schools built under Indian assistance at Gorkha, the epicenter of the 2015 earthquake, it said.Shringla will also hand over COVID-19-related support to the Government of Nepal.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pledged to construct 50,000 houses in Gorkha, the epicentre of the 2015 earthquake. The construction of forty thousand houses has already been completed there.“We have also focused on the education sector. India has also rebuilt school buildings in the Gorkha district. He will inaugurate three school buildings built in Gorkha under India’s assistance,” he said.Shringla will also inaugurate a Buddhist monastery in Manang district situated in a remote mountainous region of Nepal near the Tibetan border, which was renovated under India’s assistance.Earlier this month, Indian Army chief Gen. M M Naravane travelled to Nepal on a three-day visit during which he held talks with Nepal’s top leadership and discussed bilateral relations.During the visit, he called on Prime Minister Oli, who is also the Defence Minister of Nepal. Oli told him that problems between Nepal and India would be resolved through dialogue.Gen Naravane’s three-day visit to Nepal was largely aimed at resetting bilateral ties that came under severe strain following a bitter border row between the two countries.The ties between the two countries came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory.Days later, Nepal came out with a new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura as its territories.After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a “unilateral act” and cautioning Kathmandu that such “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it.In its reaction, after Nepal’s lower house of parliament approved the bill, India had also termed as untenable the “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims by the neighbouring country.India had said Nepal’s action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-nepal-agree-to-advance-ties-as-foreign-secretary-meets-nepalese-top-leadership-176130

26-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's air quality 'very poor', improvement predicted||Delhi's air quality was recorded in the “very poor” category on Thursday and government agencies said it is likely to improve as the wind speed picks up.The city's air quality index was 374 at 9 am on Thursday. The 24-hour average AQI was 413 on Wednesday, 379 on Tuesday and 295 on Monday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board data.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to improve to the lower end of the “very poor” category on Thursday.The predominant surface wind direction was northerly and the maximum wind speed is likely to be 10 kmph on Thursday, it said.The central agency said the AQI is likely to reach the “poor” category on Friday.The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring states to Delhi's PM2.5 levels was just 2 per cent on Wednesday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR.The minimum temperature was 10.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday. The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 23 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  Delhi's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 8,000 m2/s on Thursday and is likely to be 7,000 m2/s on Friday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-air-quality-very-poor-improvement-predicted-176125

Bhartiya Kisan Union (Haryana) leader Gurnam Singh said the protesters planned to spend the night there and will resume the march the next morning.There were traffic snarls during the day at Delhi’s border with police checking vehicles coming in from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Metro services between Delhi and NCR areas were restricted.At the Punjab-Haryana Shambhu border, police and Punjab farmers in their tractor-trolleys were locked in a confrontation for a couple of hours in the morning.Police made announcements on loudspeakers asking the farmers assembled on the Punjab side to disperse.But as protesters tried to push through barricades, the Haryana Police used a water cannon and lobbed teargas shells. Farmers chucked some steel barricades into the Ghaggar river from the bridge where they had been stopped.Apart from this confrontation in Ambala district, there were face-offs between the protesters and police in Haryana’s Sirsa, Kurukshetra, Fatehabad and Jind districts bordering Congress-run Punjab.Tension spiralled at the Shambhu interstate border as police used water cannons and teargas to disperse hundreds of farmers from Punjab who broke barricades, throwing some into the river, determined to enter the state.Haryana Police handled situation with ‘great restraint', says DGP The Haryana Police acted with “great restraint” against Punjab-based farmers who broke barricades during their “Delhi Chalo” march to ensure law and order, DGP Manoj Yadava said on Thursday.He said the farmers took an aggressive stand and tried to disturb law and order by “pelting stones” at police at many places.Some police personnel sustained injuries and police and private vehicles were damaged, Yadava added.The Haryana Director General of Police said farmers were marching towards Delhi but police would try to stop them without resorting to force.The BKU Ekta Ughran in its state committee meeting has announced that they would move for Delhi tomorrow at 11.30 am from Dabwali and Khanauri.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha and All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) said “more than 50,000 farmers will be standing at the Delhi border by today evening”.“The numbers are expected to swell through the night as thousands of tractors and trolleys are carrying farmers, women and children from interior areas of Punjab,” a statement by farmers’ coordination body said.A large number of farmers marching from grain market in Boha to Delhi for “Delhi Chalo” agitation against three farm laws, entered Haryana by breaking the police barricades at Bahmanwala border.On reaching the border, the farmers staged a protest and shouted slogans against the Union government for implementing three farm laws and trying to suppress the farmers by further imposing up to Rs 1 crore fine and sentence for stubble burning.They told the Haryana Police to allow them to go to Delhi, but police did not allow them as they had sealed and barricaded the road, but as farmers outnumbered the Haryana Police personnel deployed there, the farmers broke the barricading and went further towards Delhi.Karnal: One farmer of Punjab received injury after the police used tear gas and water cannons near Karna Lake.Farmers broke Behmanwala barrier in Boha area in Mansa district to enter Haryana.Similarly, farmers entered Hansipur in Haryana by breaking police barricade at Sardulgarh in Mansa district.Farmers crossed Bastaraa toll plaza and moved towards Panipat.Punjab farmers are getting ready to cross over to Haryana's Sirsa district near Dabwali town.After crossing Ambala, the Punjab farmers reached Kurukshetra where the administration had put up barricades and used water cannons to stop the farmers near Tyora village but the angry farmers broke open the barricades and continued their march towards Delhi on Thursday.Similarly, at the Tukar border of Pehowa in Kurukshetra the Punjab farmers broke open the barricades, throwing some into the Markanda river, to enter Haryana. The police also used water cannons to disperse the farmers but to no avail.किसानों से समर्थन मूल्य छीनने वाले कानून के विरोध में किसान की आवाज सुनने की बजाय भाजपा सरकार उन पर भारी ठंड में पानी की बौछार मारती है।किसानों से सबकुछ छीना जा रहा है और पूंजीपतियों को थाल में सजा कर बैंक, कर्जमाफी, एयरपोर्ट रेलवे स्टेशन बांटे जा रहे हैं। #FarmersProtest pic.twitter.com/al8dG8ZZhi  A few protesters and cops were injured in the scuffle as thousands of peasants removed police barricades and heavy concrete boulders blocking their way to Delhi.The injured were being shifted to hospital in an ambulance. The police have parked trucks in the middle of the highway in another bid to stop farmers' 'Delhi Chalo' march.As farmers and police faced off at a bridge with the Ghaggar river flowing below, tractors and trucks were lined up and people could be seen waving black flags and shouting slogans.Police made announcements on loudspeakers to ask the farmers assembled on the Punjab side of the border to disperse. As smoke from the teargas clouded the air and uniformed security personnel milled around, people could be seen standing on top of trucks. Television visuals also showed some bricks lying on the road.Some farmers tried to cross the barricades and remove them and some chucked them into the Ghaggar river. The Shambhu border point is about 200 km from Delhi.Leaders of All India Kisan Sabha, who have been entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring a smooth movement of farmers from the border, say that there are almost 50,000 farmers at the spot.Bracing overnight rains and chilly winds, thousands of protesting farmers on Thursday assembled at various places along the Haryana borders in Punjab amid mounting tension.Haryana had completely sealed its borders with Punjab. There was heavy deployment of Haryana police on the borders with Punjab, officials said.हुकूमत से जीतने की जद्दोजहद तभी करता है कोई किसान, जब उसने अपनी जिंदगी दांव पर लगा रखी हो|  केंद्र सरकार के तीनों खेती बिल किसान विरोधी हैं। ये बिल वापिस लेने की बजाय किसानों को शांतिपूर्ण प्रदर्शन करने से रोका जा रहा है, उन पर वॉटर कैनन चलाई जा रही हैं। किसानों पर ये जुर्म बिलकुल ग़लत है। शांतिपूर्ण प्रदर्शन उनका संवैधानिक अधिकार है।  The Haryana Police in adequate strength has also been deployed along the state's borders with Delhi, they said.Farmer bodies said they will hold a dharna wherever stopped from moving towards the National Capital.The BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) has claimed that over two lakh farmers associated with it will enter Haryana through Khanauri and Dabwali.Farmers have brought ration, vegetables, wood and other essentials for their march. In view of cold weather conditions, they have stocked quilts, blankets and covered their trolleys with tarpaulin. Haryana Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Gurnam Singh Charuni had said on Wednesday that “even if police use lathis and force, nothing can stop farmers".In the fight against three farm laws, the farmers “Delhi Chalo” agitation has got overwhelming response from the women, children and youth as large number of them have come out from their houses and are participating in these protests taking place across the state at Haryana borders.A six-year-old, Shahbaz Singh, of Chak Fatte Singhwala village has also reached at the protest holding farm union flag in his hand. While talking to The Tribune, Shahbaz said Modi government is taking their lands, due to which he has come along with his family to protest against these black Bills and “save our land”. Even school going girls wearing jeans and tops with union badge were also spotted at the Dabwali border protest. Even many youngsters were seen carrying flags in their hand and chanting slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union government over these three farm laws.BKU Ekta Ugrahan women wing president Harjinder Kaur Bindu said around 25,000 women are participating in the protest today. “We have run campaign by holding jaggo and mashal marches in 800 villages in the region to encourage women and youth to participate in the protest,” she said.Videography, including using drone cameras, is being done at the state borders with Punjab and other sensitive points.Amid the anti-farm law demonstration by several farmers’ outfits, the commuters on Delhi-Gurugram Expressway faced huge traffic snarls throughout the day.The commuters on National Highway-48 were stuck near the Delhi-Gurugram border on the Expressway as Delhi Police had put up barricades and were checking every vehicle in view of the “Delhi Chalo” call given by the farmers’ bodies protesting the Central farm laws passed by the Parliament in September.Scores of vehicles were seen lined up from the Delhi-Gurugram border to the Shankar Chowk on the National Highway.As a precautionary measure, the Haryana Police were also checking every vehicle to prevent the protesters from entering the national capital.On the other hand, the impact of the agitation by the farmers’ organisations was negligible in Gurugram district as the situation remained peaceful throughout the day, with no untoward incident getting reported from anywhere in the district.In view of the protests by various farmers’ bodies, the district administration and the Gurugram police had made elaborate arrangements to maintain law and order in the district.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-chalo-march-punjab-farmers-face-water-cannons-push-through-haryana-barricades-176110

26-11-2020||Vibha Sharma||Experts: Climate change has upped Nivar threat||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 25The actual impact of and damage caused by Nivar will be known Thursday morning, but its transition to the “very severe cyclone” is yet another indication of the various ways climate change and global warming is intensifying natural events, especially tropical storms.There has been a global increase in the intensity of the strongest storms over recent decades. Nivar intensified from a “severe” category storm to a “very severe” category within 24 hours, which scientists attribute to large-scale and local environmental conditions, including manmade contributions. There is also a correlation between cooler phase of ENSO, known as La Niña, and increased tropical cyclone activity in the Bay of Bengal. This being a La Niña year, which is also responsible for harsher and longer winter, is another underlying cause behind Nivar.According to Dr Roxy Mathew Koll from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, La Niña makes local environmental conditions favorable for cyclogenesis in the Bay of Bengal. “In the past 40 years, six cyclones of the severe cyclone category hit the Tamil Nadu coast in November, out of which five of them coincided with La Niña-like conditions in the Pacific. It means to some extent we were expecting a cyclone season in the Bay of Bengal during this time and it is not a surprise,” she said.“The Bay of Bengal is part of the warm pool region, where the temperatures are generally about 28-29°C in November and occasionally exceeding 30°C. These high temperatures are generally conducive for cyclogenesis. This time, the temperature anomalies are about 0.5-1°C and in some regions reaching 1.2°C, based on buoy and satellite estimates. Every 0.1°C means additional energy for the cyclone to maintain and develop. Locally, the winds are also favoring cyclone formation,” says Koll.Studies have found that the proportion of strongest storms is increasing about 8 per cent a decade. They also suggest how “ocean surface and subsurface conditions played a vital role in the genesis and intensification of cyclone Ockhi”, a very similar cyclone that hit the same region almost exactly three years ago.Similar to other parts of the world, sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal have been steadily increasing over the last decades, a factor driving rapid intensification. Global sea levels have already increased about 23 cm as a result of human carbon emissions, dramatically increasing the distance that storm surges can reach, experts say.Dr Anjal Prakash of the Indian School of Business adds, “Since the beginning of 2020, this is 8th such incidence in the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. Changing climatic conditions are adding more cyclonic events every year and so adaptation to these events is how we can save the lives of millions of people especially the poor and the marginalised”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/experts-climate-change-has-upped-nivar-threat-175869

Covid antibody test in all these patients was found positive. These patients came with involvement of lungs, nervous system, heart and blood vessels. Many patients who had lung involvement required oxygen term supplementation and few required special medications medication. A major complication in such patients was chronic fatigue symptom. Most of these people did not get tested thinking symptoms will resolve on their own,” Kakar said.Experts say people with mild symptoms should not take it lightly and should get tested immediately.Although in majority cases, Covid is a self-limiting disease, testing and supervision is essential in all patients, said Kakar as cases rose to 92, 22, 216  with 1,34,699 deaths (481 deaths in 24 hours).Delhi continues to lead the daily Covid surge, followed by Maharashtra, Kerala, Bengal, Rajasthan and Haryana.MOST COMMON SIGNS OF COVIDMost common symptoms of Covid are fever, try cough, tiredness. Other symptoms include aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, headache, loss of taste or smell, a rash on the skin or discolouration of fingers or toes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unattended-covid-symptoms-causing-complications-docs-175871

26-11-2020||Aditi Tandon||End of an era in Congress, Sonia’s Man Friday goes||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 26Congress stalwart Ahmed Patel’s untimely demise marks the end of an era in the grand old party currently consumed by deep internal distrusts and anxieties.Patel died at a Gurugram hospital in wee hours on Thursday after multi-organ failure due to COVID-19 complications. Patel was 71.Widely acknowledged as Congress’ chief crisis manager, Ahmed Patel shadowed Sonia Gandhi as political secretary for 19 out of 22 years she served in the post.“I have lost an irreplaceable comrade, a faithful colleague and a friend,” Sonia lamented as the tragedy struck a beleaguered party and tributes flowed from across the spectrum with Prime Minister Narendra Modi leading the condolences and hailing Patel’s role in strengthening the Congress besides his “sharp mind”.Patel’s indispensability to Sonia was evident from her reliance on him through the tenure as the longest-serving Congress president.She depended on Patel not only to negotiate the complex terrains of a 135-year old institution but also to engage the broad spectrum of the non-BJP forces bringing the alliance experiment to fruition in UPA-1.In the 10 years of the Congress-led coalition, Patel operated in his quintessential backroom style exercising iron grip over party organisation and guiding alliance equations as Sonia’s adviser.While playing a role in cabinet formations, he never desired to be a minister himself. It was perhaps Patel’s ability to rise above trappings of government power that held him in good stead with Sonia, who trusted him completely.Like former UPA minister Ashwani Kumar says: “Ahmed Patel was a master communicator. Congress President relied heavily on him for delicate political messaging within and outside the party. His ability to keep confidences was his principal strength. Also, he was a man known to know the Congress President’s mind first on all important matters. His untimely demise will further disadvantage the Congress.”Patel’s non-threatening manner and deep understanding of the Congress affairs meant he was close to all party presidents.He was one of the three parliamentary secretaries to late PM Rajiv Gandhi, who was also the Congress president. Later on, Patel came close to PV Narasimha Rao thwarting a move by the Arjun Singh led group to oust Rao after the Babri Masjid demolition.Patel enjoyed equal proximity to former Congress chief Sitaram Kesri and eventually to Sonia, who named Ambika Soni as her first political adviser only to replace her with Patel in 2001.Insiders speak of Ahmed Patel as a man who realised early on that real power in the Congress flowed from the party. That explains why he remained wedded to the organisation refusing to take up minister-ship.Patel was an eight-term parliamentarian — thrice from Lok Sabha and five times in the Rajya Sabha. He was elected to RS in 1993 after losing the 1989 general election from Bharuch in the midst of Hindutva surge in Gujarat.It was this long stint in Parliament that afforded Patel an insight into key players of contemporary political history and helped him guide Sonia better.Outside Parliament (where he made friends across hues), Patel remained an organisation man.Former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda described him today as the party’s “sankat mochan” and someone who remained a CWC member until his demise.Janardan Dwivedi said; “This is a very untimely demise. The Congress will not get another Ahmed Patel.”Among several others, the most abiding message of Patel’s life was loyalty to leadership.Barring once when he resigned as the AICC treasurer, Patel always backed the high command up until recently when he stoutly challenged the 23 leaders who voiced a rebellion against Sonia Gandhi.He will today be buried aside his parents in the native village of Bharuch where senior Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, will be present to bid him the final farewell.Patel gone, the road to intra-Congress friction stands cleared.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/end-of-an-era-in-congress-sonias-man-friday-goes-175888

26-11-2020||Satya Prakash||SC lifts gag order on media  in Amaravati land scam case||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 25The Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday lifted the gag order passed by the Andhra Pradesh High Court (HC) restraining the media from reporting about an FIR registered by the state police on the Amaravati land scam, allegedly involving a former Advocate General and two daughters of a top court judge.The order came from a three-judge Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan on an appeal filed by the YS Jaganmohan Reddy Government challenging an Andhra Pradesh High Court order that restrained the media from reporting on the issue. The HC had also stayed the probe into the case.Issuing notices to the respondents, the Bench posted the matter for final hearing in the last week of January 2021. The top court asked the Andhra Pradesh High Court not to dispose of the former Advocate General’s petition against the FIR during pendency of the matter before it.Senior counsel Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, representing the former advocate general and others, submitted that it was a case of political vendetta and ‘regime revenge’.They contended there was no illegality in purchasing land in 2015 as thousands of people did so since June 2014 after it became public that Andhra Pradesh’s capital was being shifted to Amaravati.On behalf of the state government, senior advocate Rajiv Dhavan submitted, “This is an entire political writ petition against the Chief Minister. The plea is based not on facts, but reliable sources which too are not revealed.”The Anti-Corruption Bureau of the Andhra Pradesh Police had registered an FIR against the former Advocate General, two daughters of a sitting Supreme Court judge and 11 others, accusing them of purchasing land in Amaravati — proposed capital of the state — as they had prior information about the decision.But the HC had restrained the media from reporting and stayed the probe into the case. “It is further directed that the news in regard to registration of FIR or in the context of the said FIR shall not be made public in any electronic, print or social media, to foist the office of a former Advocate General and also with respect to the other alleged accused persons,” the HC had said in its September 15 order.

26-11-2020||Buenos Aires||Soccer legend Maradona dead||Argentine soccer legend Diego Maradona, widely regarded as one of the game’s greatest ever players, died of a heart attack on Wednesday, his lawyer said.Maradona, 60, had recently battled health issues and underwent surgery for a subdural haematoma several weeks ago. He suffered a heart attack at his home on the outskirts of Buenos Aires on Wednesday, Argentinian media and acquaintances of the former player said.Argentine President Alberto Fernandez declared three days of national mourning.Retired Brazilian soccer star Pele was among those who mourned the Argentine player. “Certainly, one day we’ll kick a ball together in the sky above,” he said in a brief statement provided by a representative. Maradona’s pinnacle of glory came when he captained Argentina to win the World Cup in 1986, before plunging to misery when he was kicked out the 1994 World Cup for doping.Years of drug use, overeating and alcoholism truncated a stellar career and altered his appearance from a lithe athlete who could slalom effortlessly through teams to a bloated addict who nearly died of cocaine-induced heart failure in 2000.Famed for the “Hand of God” goal in which he punched the ball into England’s net during the 1986 World Cup quarterfinals, Maradona captivated fans over a two-decade career with a bewitching style of play that was all his own.The No. 10 he wore on his jersey became synonymous with him, as it also had with Pele, the Brazilian great with whom Maradona was regularly paired as the best of all time. — AgenciesEnd of an EraArgentine soccer great died of a heart attack.
