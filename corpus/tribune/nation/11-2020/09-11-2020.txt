It is a pity that they have been forced to sit on the road to demand their salaries,” Sultana said.The salaries of permanent employees of the Board are pending since May, while the contractual ones have not been paid since February, a striking employee said.“Not just the salaries, there is no money even for office expenses. We have been forced to hit the street as our financial hardship is increasing with every passing day,” he said.The financial transactions of the Board are conducted through an account jointly operated by its chairman, one member and a government official, sources said.A meeting of seven members of the Waqf Board is due on November 19 to elect a new chairman.AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan served as chairman of the Board. He had to step down after his term as a member ended with the Delhi assembly elections in February.

09-11-2020||Hyderabad/New Delhi||Telangana student of Delhi LSR college ends life over ‘financial burden’ of education||A 19-year-old Telangana student of Lady Shri Ram (LSR) College for Women in Delhi has allegedly died by suicide worried about pursuing education in view of her family’s poor financial condition, prompting Rahul Gandhi to mount an attack on the ruling BJP at the Centre.The Congress leader accused the Modi government of destroying countless homes due to the ‘deliberate’ lockdown and demonetisation, while student groups in the national capital staged protests over the woman’s death.Members of the Congress-affiliated National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) protested outside the residence of Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal “Nishank”, and the Left-affiliated All India Students Association (AISA) staged an agitation outside the Delhi University’s Arts Faculty.The LSR college management denied that the student had reached out to the college authorities on scholarship.Aishwarya, an IAS aspirant, was found hanging at her house in Shadnagar in Telangana’s Ranga Reddy district on November 2, police said on Monday.The second-year BSc (Honours) in Mathematics student had returned from Delhi in March this year after those staying in the hostel were asked to go home by the college authorities in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.In a suicide note purportedly written by her, the teenager said she did not want to burden her parents with her educational expenses, police said.The family had even stopped the education of Aishwarya’s younger sister to try to ensure she pursued her education.Her father G Srinivas Reddy said his daughter was worried over continuing her education due to financial problems and was thinking over it for the past several days.She had secured a good rank in intermediate second year and got a seat in the LSR. He took loan and admitted her in the college, Reddy said.“I am a mechanic, but my work is also not doing well. She was worried about next year’s college fee,” he told mediapersons in Hyderabad.The family’s SOS to actor Sonu Sood, who had reached out to many hapless families during the lockdown, following the deceased’s requirement of a laptop or phone for attending online studies, also went unanswered.“There was no reply from him...The college administration also said hostel facility will be given only for one year,” he said.In his complaint, Reddy stated his daughter had recently asked him for money for her studies and he had told her it was not immediately possible and that he would obtain a loan to meet the needs, police said.In the purported suicide note, the student blamed no one for taking the extreme step and said she was ending her life due to financial problems. Aishwarya sought forgiveness adding that she was not a “good daughter”.“Nobody is responsible for my death. My family is incurring a lot of expenses. I am a burden... My education is a burden..I cannot live without education,” she purportedly wrote in the note.Aishwarya, who was awarded INSPIRE merit scholarship by the Department of Science & Technology, also mentioned that it needed “to be released for at least one year.”Condoling her death, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accused the Modi government of destroying countless homes due to the ‘deliberate’ lockdown and demonetisation.“My condolences to the family members $of the girl in this very sad moment.The BJP government destroyed countless homes due to the deliberate demonetisation and countrywide lockdown.This is the truth,” Gandhi said on Twitter, a day after the fourth anniversary of the NDA government’s move to demonetise high value currency notes—Rs 2000 and Rs 500.Meanwhile, students and women groups staged protests in Delhi on Monday, demanding justice for the deceased woman.NSUI national secretary Lokesh Chugh said, “Scholarships are to reward a student’s academic achievement and educational prowess.”He alleged Aishwarya committed suicide after being denied scholarship for over a year by the government and that she had written to the administration about the problems she was facing.“But unfortunately, she received no response from the authorities. This is just a recent example of how imperative scholarships are for students.When the government delays the provision of funds to students, it puts them and their families under immense pressure,” he added.LSR principal Suman Sharma, however, denied that the student had reached out to the college authorities.“We have a counsellor at the college to help students if they are facing any challenges, emotionally or mentally.However, nobody knew about her state of mind.It is unfortunate. We wish she had reached out either to her teachers or the counsellor or anybody in the college,” she said.In a statement, AISA expressed solidarity “with all the forces dedicated to deliver justice to the family and the student community.”The All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) said “in a country where the gross enrolment ratio of girl students into higher educational institutions shows a pathetically skewed figure, a girl such as the LSR student, who struggled to reach Delhi with the dream for education, has been killed.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-student-of-delhi-lsr-college-ends-life-over-financial-burden-of-education-168405
09-11-2020||New Delhi||Abrogation of Article 370: JKPC moves SC for early hearing||The Sajad Gani Lone-led Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference (JKPC) has moved the Supreme Court of India demanding early hearing of petitions challenging the nullification of Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution.Referring to the “sweeping changes” introduced in Jammu & Kashmir by the Centre, the plea filed through JKPC spokesperson Adnan Ashraf, stated that such changes will have an irreparable impact on the rights of people of the erstwhile state.This is the second such plea recently filed in the top court, which is seized of a batch of petitions challenging the Presidential Orders nullifying Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories.Earlier, petitioner Shakir Shabir had demanded early hearing, expressing the apprehension that mere passage of time can render the abrogation of Article 370 permanent, making the petitions infructuous.He had pointed out that since the promulgation of the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019, amending Article 367 of the Constitution of India and abrogating Article 370 on August 5, 2019, several laws had been passed, effecting key changes in Jammu and Kashmir.The Supreme Court had on August 28, 2019, referred petitions challenging Presidential Orders nullifying Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories to a five-judge Constitution Bench. In March this year, the top court had refused to refer it to a larger Bench.The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which divided the state into two union territories---Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh---has already been notified in the official gazette and would come into effect on October 31.There are several petitions challenging the Presidential Order nullifying Article 370, including those by Delhi-based advocate ML Sharma, Jammu and Kashmir-based lawyer Shakir Shabir, National Conference Lok Sabha MPs Mohammad AKbar Lone and Justice (Retd) Hasnain Masoodi, bureaucrat-turned-politician Shah Faesal and his party colleague Shehla Rashid.There is another PIL filed by former interlocutor for Jammu and Kashmir Radha Kumar, Air Vice Marshal (Retd) Kapil Kak, Major General (Retd) Ashok Mehta, and former IAS officers Hindal Haidar Tyabji, Amitabha Pande and Gopal Pillai who have urged the top court to declare the August 5 Presidential Orders be declared “unconstitutional, void and inoperative”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abrogation-of-article-370-jkpc-moves-sc-for-early-hearing-168404

I suggest you check with the relevant competent authority or local government,” Wenbin said during a media briefing here.According to media reports, an Indian ship named ‘Jag Anand’ has been stuck at China’s Jingtang port since June with the crew members seeking immediate help.Relations between Australia and China in the past few months nose-dived after Australia barred Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies from its national 5G network over national security concerns.China also resented Canberra’s push for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus in April.Reports from Australia say China has been restricting a number of Australian exports, including coal.Apart from this, China appears to be irked by a law Australia passed in 2018 that banned covert foreign interference in domestic politics and made industrial espionage for a foreign power a crime.The laws offended the nation’s most important trading partner, China.Recently, the Chinese Communist Party-controlled Global Times reported that China had asked traders to stop buying at least seven categories of Australian products: coal, barley, copper ore and concentrate, sugar, timber, wine and lobsters.

09-11-2020||New Delhi||Deceased woman’s photo circulated as Hathras victim; Delhi HC asks Centre why no action||The Delhi High Court asked the Centre on Monday why no action was taken on a man’s plea claiming that his deceased wife’s photograph was being wrongly depicted on social media platforms as the victim of Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras rape case.Justice Navin Chawla noted that the petitioner had sent a representation on October 17 to the Centre but no action has been taken till date.In response to the court’s query, central government standing counsel Monika Arora said the petitioner had to first provide certain details, like specific URLs and web pages where the offending content was being displayed, the death certificate of his wife, his Aadhaar card and any FIR lodged by him regarding the issue raised in his plea.The petitioner’s counsel told the court that over 200 uniform resource locators (URLs), also termed as web addresses, were provided to the government along with his representation on October 17, but no action has been taken till date.He further contended that the court in its October 13 order had directed the government to take action within three days of receiving the representation.The court asked the petitioner to hand over a copy of his representation to Arora and asked her to do something about it quickly as it was a “grave case”.It also directed the government to file its status report within a week and listed the matter for further hearing on November 23.The court on October 13 had said if the man’s complaint is found to be correct, the government should act on it expeditiously by issuing necessary directions to Facebook, Google and Twitter in this regard.The man, in his plea, has contended that the photograph of his deceased wife is being circulated on various social media platforms wrongly depicting her as the victim of the unfortunate incident of rape and murder of a young girl at Hathras, Uttar Pradesh.He also argued that even otherwise, revelation of the identity of the rape victim is an offence under the Indian Penal Code, though in the present matter image of a wrong person is in circulation.A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital during treatment.

Police obstructed him and other representatives from performing their duty as Members of Parliament, he alleged.“There is complete breakdown of law and order in West Bengal,” he said. “We were carrying out our solemn duty as MPs of raising our voice to express the anguish and concerns of the common people of India, to defend their democratic rights and represent their concerns and interests. We were not only impeded at our work but we were, including a female Member of Parliament present with us, manhandled, assaulted with tear gas shells and water cannons and crude bombs.

09-11-2020||Mumbai||Virgin Hyperloop completes first-ever human trial in hyperloop pod||Virgin Hyperloop on Monday said it has “successfully” completed the first-ever human trial in the hyperloop pod at the DevLoop test facility in the US.Two passengers, both company staff, travelled 500 metres in 15 seconds, reaching 107 mph (172 km per hour), marking the completion of the first-ever trial, the company said.The testing campaign will continue with Pune native and Virgin Hyperloop Power Electronics Specialist, Tanay Manjrekar, riding next, the company said in the release.Hyperloop is a next-generation travel system that uses pods or capsules travelling at high speeds through low-pressure tubes erected on columns or tunnelled underground using magnetic levitation. The system is fully autonomous and sealed, so no driver-related error is anticipated.“For the past few years, the Virgin Hyperloop team has been working on turning its ground-breaking technology into reality,” said Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group.He added that with Monday’s successful test, the company has shown that this spirit of innovation will in fact change the way people everywhere live, work, and travel in the years to come.The Maharashtra government has deemed hyperloop a public infrastructure project and approved the Virgin Hyperloop-DP World Consortium as the original project proponent (OPP) for the Mumbai-Pune hyperloop project.The occupants made their maiden voyage on the newly-unveiled XP-2 vehicle, designed by BIG-Bjarke Ingels Group and Kilo Design, which was custom-built with occupant safety and comfort in mind, the company said in the release.This successful test is a landmark announcement for building the Pune-Mumbai hyperloop transportation system, recognising hyperloop technology alongside other more traditional forms of mass transit, said the release.“Today’s test is a significant step forward towards a commercial hyperloop in India — perhaps the world’s first — connecting Pune with Mumbai along the existing Expressway,” said Harj Dhaliwal, managing director (Middle East and India) of Virgin Hyperloop.He added that the opportunity for India to lead the world in this new form of transportation is unprecedented. “The project would be the largest private infrastructure investment in Maharashtra, creating 1.8 million direct and indirect jobs and USD 36 billion in socio-economic benefits.”While the production vehicle will be larger and seat up to 28 passengers, this 2-seater XP-2 vehicle was built to demonstrate that passengers can in fact safely travel in a hyperloop vehicle, it added.The human testing, from the beginning stages to Monday’s successful demonstration, was overseen by the industry-recognised independent safety assessor (ISA) certifer, Virgin Hyperloop said.Having undergone a rigorous and exhaustive safety process, the newly unveiled XP-2 vehicle demonstrates many of the safety-critical systems that will be found on a commercial hyperloop system, it added. It is equipped with a state-of-the-art control system that can detect abnormal conditions and rapidly trigger appropriate emergency responses.“Working on hyperloop – let alone being one of the first to ride it – is truly a dream come true,” said Manjrekar, power electronics specialist at Virgin Hyperloop.Last month, Virgin Hyperloop announced a partnership with Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) to conduct a feasibility study for a proposed hyperloop corridor from Bangalore airport.Last year, it also signed an MoU with the Punjab’s transport department, Virgin Hyperloop said.The company hopes to expand on its relationship with Punjab as the company continues exploring opportunities in northern India, independent of their work in the western and southern regions of the country, it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/virgin-hyperloop-completes-first-ever-human-trial-in-hyperloop-pod-168398

Legal action initiated”.Former Tripura and Meghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy, an ideological co-traveller of Kishwar, was first to point out her indiscretion.“This is an Islamist procession in Dhaka, not Kolkata. They are shouting slogans against atheists and in slightly nuanced language against Hindus. They are yelling, those who are against Islam have no place in ‘this Bangla’, go to Hindustan,” Roy tweeted, tagging Kishwar.Kishwar, ICSSR National Professor, who describes herself in her twitter bio as one who is “averse to all isms”, has since removed the video from the microblogging site.

As per the informant, this amounts to abuse of its dominant position by Google in violation of various provisions of Section 4 of the Act, it said.The CCI said that the commission is of the prima facie view that the ‘Opposite Parties’—Google, Alphabet Inc.—have contravened various provisions of Section 4 of the Act, and it warrants a detailed investigation.“In view of the foregoing, the Commission directs the Director General (‘DG’) to cause an investigation to be made into the matter under the provisions of Section 26(1) of the Act. The Commission also directs the DG to complete the investigation and submit the investigation report within a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of this order,” it said.In response to the allegations, Google and its parent company Alphabet Inc. said that Google does not favour the GPay app (Tez) in Play’s search rankings and these allegations are “wholly misconceived”.“Google ranks search results in Play based on multiple criteria which do not favour the GPay app (Tez). Further, Google has every commercial incentive to ensure that its search rankings in Play provide users with high quality, relevant apps that are responsive to the user’s query,” they said in their reply.The CCI order also said that that nothing stated in the order shall tantamount to a final expression of opinion on the merits of the case and the DG shall conduct the investigation “without being swayed in any manner whatsoever by the observations made herein”.--- IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cci-probe-against-google-for-unfair-means-to-promote-gpay-168392
09-11-2020||New Delhi||SC to hear plea against HC order staying 80% reservation of ICU beds for COVID-19 patients||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Tuesday an appeal filed by the Delhi government against the Delhi High Court’s order staying its decision to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds in 33 private hospitals for COVID-19 patients.A Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and BR Gavai would take up the Delhi government’s plea for hearing on a vacation. The apex court is on Diwali break this week.A single judge Bench of the high court on September 22 had stayed the Delhi government’s September 12 decision saying that asking 33 big private hospitals to reserve 80 per cent of ICU beds for COVID-19 patients would violate the fundamental rights of those having other health conditions.The government has already challenged the single judge’s stay order before a Division Bench of the high court which has listed it for hearing on November 27.While staying the Delhi government’s order, the high court had come down heavily on it asking whether the non-COVID-19 patients have a right to life or not.It had observed that prima facie, the government’s order was “arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of fundamental rights of citizens” guaranteed under the Constitution.               “The state cannot discriminate between a COVID-19 and a non-COVID-19 patient requiring emergent treatment. In time of emergency, such patients cannot be told to run around finding a hospital where beds have not been reserved for COVID-19 patients. The disease itself cannot be a ground for such discrimination,” the single judge Bench had said in its September 22 order.The single judge Bench had passed the order on a plea by ‘Association of Healthcare Providers’ challenging the Delhi government’s September order.Over the last few days, Delhi has reported record spikes in coronavirus cases. The national capital reported its biggest single-day jump of 7,745 cases on Sunday, taking its tally to 4,38,529.On the national level, India’s COVID-19 caseload rose to 85,53,657 with 45,903 new infections being reported, while the number of people who have recuperated from the disease crossed 79 lakh, pushing the national recovery rate to 92.56 per cent, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Monday.The death toll from the disease climbed to 1,26,611 with 490 new fatalities being registered, the data updated at 8 am showed.

09-11-2020||New Delhi||India bid to expand alternative supply chain in Asia Pacific||India is keen on expanding its current conversations with Japan and Australia on a proposed supply-chain partnership to include other countries in the region.This initiative is aimed at minimising the adverse effects of walking-out of a regional free trade agreement that includes these two countries besides China and over a dozen other countries.India is proposing that some ASEAN countries can be added to the India-Australia-Japan discussions on China-free supply chains, said sources here.The proposal comes against the backdrop of these very two countries planning to launch a Regional Economic Cooperation Partnership framework pact this Sunday in partnership with China, South Korea, New Zealand and 10 countries of the ASEAN bloc.The 15 Asia-Pacific countries, barring India, aim to ink the RCEP on November 15 to set up an economic bloc equal to third of the global GDP and population.India will be on the sidelines when this agreement will be struck but its close ally Japan will sign its first FTA that includes China and South Korea.As this development will be a setback to India’s zero sum game with China, sources said recent diplomatic talks plan to expand the ambit of India-Japan-Australia negotiations from the present government-to-government level to the industry and academia of these countries.It is not clear how an alternate supply chain will play out vis-à-vis the RCEP that aims to bind 14 neighbouring countries (barring India) and China into much closer economic linkages.The RCEP includes most of the countries with which India would like to strike deeper economic and security partnerships in order to improve its standing and marginalise China.Sources said this approach is in full play in the immediate neighbourhood including Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Bangladesh and the Maldives.There was no response on whether it would take off in ASEAN which is on the verge of striking a deal for a free trade arrangement with China and the region’s major players. India had last November expressed its unwillingness to participate in the final stretch of RCEP talks because it feared a further widening of trade deficit with China.The India, Japan and Australia initiative was launched in September to achieve supply-chain resilience in the Indo-Pacific region.It has now moved to identifying a dozen sectors where supply-chains can shift away from China. These include energy, automobiles, steel, pharma, textiles and garments, marine products, financial services, IT services, tourism and skill development.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-bid-to-expand-alternative-supply-chain-in-asia-pacific-168386
09-11-2020||New Delhi||If exit polls projections come true, Chirag may fulfil his father’s wish to unseat Kumar||If the actual results of Bihar assembly elections mirror the exit polls projections, Chirag Paswan of LJP may be able to fulfil his father late Ramvilas Paswan’s long-standing dream of unseating incumbent Nitish Kumar from power in the state.Senior Paswan, who had died just a few days before the three-phased Bihar assembly elections, was known to have kept grudge against Kumar since the second assembly elections in the state that took place in November 2005.Kumar, the NDA face at that time, with the help pharmaceutical baron King Mahendra from the state, managed to split LJP and took away 17 MLAs, taking the ruling alliance’s number to 144 in the 243 member assembly.Since then, Ramvilas always sided with the parties that opposed Kumar. In 2010, his party LJP contested the election in alliance with Lalu Prasad’s RJD. In 2015, when Kumar switched sides to join hands with Lalu Prasad against BJP, LJP went with the saffron party. But on both the occasions he failed to damage the wily Nitish Kumar.This time around senior Paswan is not on the scene, but his son Chirag decided to go alone and field candidates on all 143 seats from where JD (U) nominees are contesting and kept his campaign focused on opposing only Nitish Kumar.Keen Bihar watchers felt that if exit polls projections mirror the actual results tomorrow, Chirag would be successful where his father wasn’t. They say all the exit polls have projected that LJP is going to get seven to ten percent of votes, which may not be sufficient for translating them into seats, but this would damage the fortunes of the JD (U). Several observers have noted how Chirag praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi throughout his campaign and that in those seats the forward caste voters, who are inimical to the RJD, had an option to vote for.There is also a feeling among the political analysts in the state that if the Chirag factor works as projected, there is a possibility of JD(U) becoming the fourth party in terms of number of seats in the assembly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-exit-polls-projections-come-true-chirag-may-fulfil-his-fathers-wish-to-unseat-kumar-168384

Almost all the exit polls have predicted a win for the RJD-led Grand Alliance, which has projected Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial candidate.Sources close to the family said Tejashwi called Prasad’s helper’s number a couple of times around 12 am to speak to his father but he had gone to sleep by that time.The young RJD leader again called the number at 6 am Monday but could not speak, the sources added.                             As soon as Prasad woke up, he called back and wished Tejashwi on his birthday, the sources said.“Tohfa to Bihar ki janta kal degi, (The people of Bihar will give you a birthday gift tomorrow),” Prasad told Tejashwi, according to a source close to the family.Lalu Prasad is currently undergoing treatment at Ranchi’s Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) for various ailments.Addressing an election rally in Hisua in Nawada district on October 23, Tejashwi had said his father will come out of jail on his birthday on November 9 after securing bail in a fodder scam case, and incumbent Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will have his farewell the next day.However, Prasad could not secure bail as the Jharkhand High Court Friday deferred the hearing on his application till November 27 after the CBI sought time to file a written reply in the case.Prasad and his wife Rabri Devi have nine children. Besides Tejashwi, his elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav and sister Misa Bharti are also active in politics.The RJD supremo, who has been debarred from contesting elections after his conviction in fodder scam cases, had chosen Tejashwi as his heir by anointing him as deputy chief minister in the 2015 Grand Alliance government headed by then ally Nitish Kumar. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lalu-wishes-tejashwi-on-bday-says-bihar-will-give-him-gift-on-counting-day-168380
09-11-2020||New Delhi||FIR against AAP leaders for ‘circulating fake video’ on social media||A case has been registered by police on a complaint of Delhi BJP general secretary Kuljeet Chahal, accusing AAP leaders of circulating a “fake” news clipping on social media that claims corruption in municipal corporations ruled by his party.The AAP, in a statement, termed the allegations levelled against the party “baseless”.Chahal told a press conference that the police are investigating the role of AAP leaders behind the circulation of the “fake” video, in which it was alleged that Bharatiya Janata Party councillors were involved in corruption and misappropriation of Rs 1,400 crore.The case was lodged at the North Avenue police station under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Information Technology (IT) Act on Saturday.“BJP leader Kuljeet Singh Chahal has given a complaint regarding a fake video which is being circulated on social media. A case has been registered and further investigation is underway,” a senior police officer said.Chahal, in his complaint, has named AAP leader Durgesh Pathak and the party’s leader of opposition in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), Vikas Goel, saying on November 1, they levelled “unfounded” allegations of “corruption and misappropriation of funds” against BJP councillors.“The video is a reiteration of what the AAP spokesperson had alleged in their press conference on November 1, that the NDMC councillors are indulging in corrupt practices and misappropriation of property tax worth Rs 1400 crore,” Chahal complained.He also said the video of the purported news clipping also used the logo of a television news channel to make it look like genuine.“The channel has verified that it’s a fake video,” he said.Refuting the claims, the AAP said, “The BJP has levelled baseless and false allegations. We will respond in the court”.The BJP and AAP have been taking potshots at one another levelling allegations of corruption and misgovernance, with an eye to the municipal corporation elections due in early 2022.

09-11-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||Andhra Pradesh seeks Rs 5,279-crore central assistance for flood relief||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, November 9 A day after Telangana accused the Central government of showing step-motherly treatment towards non-BJP ruled states, the Andhra Pradesh Government on Monday sent yet another request to the Centre to release Rs 5,279 crore as compensation for the restoration of infrastructure damaged due to heavy rains and floods in the state from August-October. A central team that visited Andhra Pradesh to assess the damage met Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney, who then told the visiting Inter-ministerial Central Team that the state has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 6,320.83 crore due flooding by Krishna and Godavari. She said a sum of Rs 5,279.11 crore was required immediately to get the state machinery back to work. The central team is being led by Joint Secretary Saurav Ray, who assured the state of all possible help.  Andhra Pradesh has told the visiting delegation that Rs 840.07 crore was due to the state as per National Disaster Relief Fund norms and an amount of Rs 4,439.14 crore further required for permanent restoration of damaged infrastructure. “Generous support by the Government of India, which is already in critical financial position due to Covid-19, would help the state,” the chief secretary said. The floods in Godavari and Krishna rivers were caused due to incessant rains in upper catchment areas of the two river basins in Telangana, Maharashtra and Karnataka, besides heavy rains in the state.  The visiting delegation was told that 8,784 houses were fully damaged in the affected districts while a large number of cattle were also killed, besides agriculture crops like paddy, maize, cotton, black gram, pulses and sugarcane, suffered damage in over 2,12,588 hectares. The maximum damage has been suffered by paddy in about 1, 40,485 hectares. Telangana had alleged on Sunday that despite a central team visiting the state and President, Prime Minister and Governors asking about the damage caused had not sent any amount to the state for relief and rehabilitation. The state has on its own released a relief package of over Rs 500 crore.  Officials in Andhra Pradesh said they were hoping that the state does not meet the same fate as Telangana in terms of being ignored for a relief package.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-pradesh-seeks-rs-5-279-crore-central-assistance-for-flood-relief-168374
09-11-2020||New Delhi||Bihar elections verdict test of ‘mood of the nation’ for NDA, PM Modi||Amid some very encouraging ‘exit poll’ predictions favouring RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav-led ‘mahagathbandhan’, key state Bihar is set to deliver tomorrow a verdict on what is being called the test of “mood of the nation”.The first state elections coming amid the COVID-19 pandemic will test the NDA-led Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and political worth of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar fighting his most difficult elections in the backdrop of 15-year anti-incumbency and gauntlet thrown down by LJP president Chirag Paswan.  They have transcended local and state issues to become a measure of national sentiments, political observers say.Apart from the Covid-induced stresses like migrant, economic and jobs crisis, Bihar also polled amid the debate surrounding the contentious CAA, which many believe is one of the reasons for the BJP’s loss in Delhi. Launching its characteristic poll blitzkrieg, the BJP gave these elections all it had with PM Modi and party president JP Nadda leading from the front, making it more about Modi and BJP than Nitish Kumar who remained bogged down by his own difficulties, including Chirag Paswan’s constant nagging.Though political observers say Chirag could not have pulled such a big stunt without blessings of the BJP.“Whatever happens in Bihar tomorrow there is no denying the nationwide support for PM Modi and political acumen of the BJP. To think Chirag would have antagonised the BJP to spite Nitish Kumar is unthinkable.” However, despite Chirag’s constant needling the BJP threw its weight behind Nitish Kumar. Prime Minister Modi, who addressed around 12 rallies and fired all ammo in BJP’s arsenal like ‘Ram temple’, ‘development and double engine ki sarkar’ versus ‘double yuvraj and jungle raj’, promise of development,  jobs etc, always praised  ‘mitr’ Nitish Kumar and his ‘sushasan’ model. To divert attention from the 15-year incumbency faced by Nitish Kumar, the BJP made these elections into ‘Modi versus the rest’ with some heavy dosage of ‘nationalism’ and its ‘anti-national rivals’. Meanwhile, apart from decades-long political worth of Nitish Kumar, the day will also test JP Nadda as the BJP president who is yet to register an electoral victory for his party since he became the president. For him, these elections are as crucial.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-elections-verdict-test-of-mood-of-the-nation-for-nda-pm-modi-168373

His latest address was only of 10 minutes but had the important message of continued adherence to COVID-appropriate behaviour and its transformation to a Jan Andolan (people’s movement).” Sharing the nation’s journey in the fight against the pandemic, he said the number of laboratories increased from one in January to 2,074 now and the testing capacity has increased to 1.5 million daily.The Union health minister also spoke about the increased number of general, oxygenated and ICU beds at each level of COVID care hierarchy.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan requested all States to focus on 10 key areas to contain the infection and gain an upper hand over its trajectory.These are increasing testing, targeted testing at market-places, workplaces, religious congregations which could have the potential to become super-spreaders, increasing the share of RT-PCR in testing, compulsory testing of symptomatic RAT negatives, completion of contact tracing within the first 72 hours, tracing of an average of 10-15 contacts per new case detected.National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Director Sujeet K Singh apprised everybody on the trajectory of the coronavirus disease and the public health response efforts in the states.The State Health Ministers shared a brief snapshot of the actions taken for containment, surveillance and treatment of COVID-19 cases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/winters-festivities-may-upend-gains-made-against-covid-19-vardhan-168372

However, at this stage, the commission stresses on the need to strictly enforce existing laws, rules, guidelines, directions and standard operating procedures to minimise air pollution on an emergency basis," it said in a statement.The panel also called for encouraging "coal-using industries in NCR to minimize the use of coal in the coming months" It asked the implementing agencies to strictly enforce laws and rules regarding dust control measures, including at construction sites and burning of municipal solid waste and biomass.Intensifying water sprinkling, particularly in dust prone areas and use of anti-smog guns at pollution hotspots, especially at construction sites, were among the immediate measures suggested by the commission.The blanket of smog over Delhi thickened on Monday, reducing visibility in parts of the city to just 400 metres as the air quality remained "severe" for the fifth consecutive day.Government agencies and experts said calm wind was exacerbating the effect of stubble burning and a "quick recovery" is not possible unless the number of farm fires reduces drastically. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/need-to-strictly-enforce-laws-sops-to-minimise-air-pollution-air-quality-management-panel-168371

Plants from seeds transported from Kashmir have now been successfully cultivated in the north-eastern state of Sikkim.The cultivation of saffron, said to be the world’s costliest spice, was heretofore restricted to a limited geographical area in the Kashmir Valley such as Pampiore, Budgam, Srinagar and Kishtwar regions.Saffron plants have been acclimatised for conditions and are now flowering in Yangyang, in the southern part of Sikkim, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology today.As saffron cultivation was confined to a very small area, its production remained limited. Trials are also underway to grow Saffron in the upper areas of Himachal Pradesh and some parts of Ladakh. This would increase the crop output and consequently have socio-economic spin-offs. The annual demand of saffron in India is about 100 tonnes, but its average production is only 6-7 tonnes per year.Named after its colour, saffron is the stamen of a lavender coloured flower that grows in cold and dry climate and is considered to have medicinal   properties. It is also extensively used in Kashmiri cuisine and for flavouring milk and deserts.The North East Centre For Technology Application and Reach (NECTAR), an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology, supported a pilot project to explore the feasibility of growing saffron in the north east.The botany and horticulture department of Sikkim Central University carried out tests to understand the soil and actual pH conditions of Yangyang and found it comparable to saffron growing places of Kashmir. Saffron seeds and corms were procured and air transported from Kashmir to Yangyang site by the department. One saffron grower was engaged and stationed to look after the complete growing process, along with the faculty of the university.The corms were irrigated during the month of September and October, which ensured timely corm sprouting and good flower yields. The matching of climatic and geographical conditions between Pampore and Yangyang resulted in successful sample farming of Saffron in Yangyang.The project also focused on post-harvest management and value addition of saffron so that quality saffron drying and efficient post-harvest processing can improve saffron recovery, thereby improving its production, the ministry said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trials-to-farm-saffron-in-sikkim-successful-kashmir-may-lose-monopoly-168361
09-11-2020||New Delhi||News anchor writes to CJI, seeks safety of Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami||A news anchor of Republic TV has written a letter to Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, urging him to take cognizance of shifting of Arnab Goswami to Taloja Jail to keep him allegedly with “hardened” and “underworld” criminals and provide “some sort of safety” to him.Goswami, Editor-in-Chief of Republic TV, and two others have been denied interim bail on Monday by Bombay High Court in a 2018 case of abetment of suicide of an interior designer.The journalist, who was initially kept at a local school designated as COVID-19 centre for the Alibaug prison, was shifted to the Taloja jail in Raigad district on Sunday after allegedly being found using a mobile phone while in judicial custody.Pradeep Bhandari, a consulting editor with the news channel, in his letter written on Sunday to the CJI alleged that Goswami had been shifted to jail on a “false pretext” and he would be kept in Taloja Jail with “hardened” and “underworld” criminals.He said Goswami had said “his life is in danger and he has been beaten up in the morning” and urged the CJI to take cognizance of this matter and provide some sort of safety to him.The letter read that Goswami had been “brutalised and tortured” for his views against the Maharashtra government.“In the morning (Sunday), I came to know in a surprise move that Maharashtra government is shifting Arnab Goswami from Mumbai to Taloja Jail on false pretext without any reason which is a Jail full of hardened criminals and underworld criminals of Mumbai and Maharashtra,” it said.It is further alleged that Goswami has not been allowed to talk with his advocates or anybody en route and that he has somehow managed to say a few words to the few reporters regarding his life being in danger.Bhandari said he had also written to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to immediately take note of the incident and send a team “today itself” in Taloja Jail and initiate an independent enquiry so that there will be no further harm to Goswami and so that his safety and wellbeing can be assured in Jail.“I am praying for immediate action in this matter as it involves human rights violation of the country’s one of the top journalist who is being harassed and tortured by the Maharashtra state for political reasons..,”  the letter said.Goswami and the two others were arrested by Alibaug police on November 4 in connection with the suicide of architect-interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother in 2018 over alleged non-payment of dues by companies of the accused.The three were later taken to Alibaug and produced before a magistrate who refused their custody to police and remanded them in judicial custody till November 18.In his petition, Goswami alleged that he is being targeted and harassed by the Maharashtra government for his reportage on his news channel.Now, Goswami’s regular bail plea would be heard by a lower court.

09-11-2020||New Delhi||To create alibi, Karnataka ex-minister travelled to Delhi before and after BJP worker’s killing: CBI||Former Karnataka minister Vinay Kulkarni had travelled to Delhi before and after the killing of BJP worker Yogesh Gowda in Dharwad on June 15, 2016, to use it as an alibi, the CBI has alleged.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had arrested Kulkarni, a Congress leader, on Thursday.The CBI probe into the killing, so far, shows that Kulkarni, who was sent to judicial custody on Monday by a special court, had left for Delhi on June 12, 2016, at 11.30 am by a flight and returned the next day at 10.40 am.Similarly, he allegedly left for Delhi on June 16, 2016, evening, a day after the murder, and returned on June 18, 2016, according to the probe by the CBI, which took over the investigation into the case on the recommendation of the Karnataka government.“The tickets were booked on the same day of the journey and the purpose of the journey was to create an alibi,” the CBI has alleged.Gowda, a BJP Zilla Panchayat member, was killed in his gym in Dharwad by unidentified men on June 15, 2016, officials said.Gowda’s murder was a result of political rivalry as Kulkarni, the then MLA and minister, had allegedly asked him not contest the Zilla Panchayat elections, which the former had refused, according to the agency’s probe.Kulkarni and Gowda had entered into verbal altercations on several occasions, and a “serious altercation” took place during a Zilla Panchayat meeting chaired by Kulkarni on April 22, 2016, the CBI has alleged.The agency has also alleged that the altercation triggered the conspiracy to murder Gowda.The Congress has denied the allegations against Kulkarni and has called the case a political witch hunt.“Congress leader Vinay Kulkarni’s arrest by the ‘puppet CBI’ reflects the blatant conspiracy & malicious intent of CM, Yediyurappa & BJP leadership,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted.B S Yediyurappa should know that Congress leaders will not be cowed down by such cowardly attacks of the BJP and its pawn, the CBI, he said.Surjewala accused the Centre of “misusing” central agencies to “hound” Congress leaders.He had also tweeted that a “fledgling” Yediyurappa government and the BJP “misuse its frontal organisations, the CBI-ED-Income Tax to hound Congress leaders- Sh. D.K.Shivakumar, Sh. G.Parameshwara, Sh. Vinay Kulkarni & many others”.The CBI has alleged that as part of the conspiracy, Kulkarni had intervened and assisted to broker a real-estate agreement between Basavaraj Muttagi, an accused in the case and Nagendra Todkar on May 24, 2016, less than a month before the killing.The local police had shown the deal to be a purported property dispute between Muttagi and Gowda, and termed it as motive for murder in its charge sheet.During the CBI probe, the owner of the property allegedly denied having any dispute with Gowda and also deposed before the trial court.The agency has alleged that the killers, who had come from Bengaluru, were made to stay at a resort owned by a close confidante of Kulkarni on June 7, 2016, during first attempt to murder, the officials said.The CBI has also alleged that Kulkarni had booked a room at a Bengaluru hotel between June 8 to June 20 and also met Muttagi a day after the murder at 01.30 am on June 16, 2016. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-create-alibi-karnataka-ex-minister-travelled-to-delhi-before-and-after-bjp-workers-killing-cbi-168350
09-11-2020||New Delhi||India-Africa relations bound to improve, Tunisian Ambassador Lakhal||Appreciating India’s accent on strengthening ties with the continent and characterising the India-Africa Forum Summit as an ambitious initiative, outgoing Ambassador of Tunisia said the next edition of the summit should further boost the partnership. “India-Africa Forum Summit is an ambitious initiative that is gradually but confidently strengthening the relations of cooperation between Africa and India…I strongly believe that the outcomes of the next summit will further boost the partnership between Africa and India, and broaden and strengthen people to people interaction and connectivity,” Ambassador Nejmeddine Lakhal told The Tribune. Plans to hold the fourth edition of the summit this autumn and several activities planned in the run-up were postponed after the global health pandemic COVID-19.Since the 2015 summit, India increased its diplomatic presence in Africa. Now India has residential diplomatic missions in 38 countries executing 194 developmental projects in 37 African countries. India-Africa trade is robust, which has grown from US$ 51.7 billion in 2010-11 to $66.7 billion in 2019-20. With India’s exports to Africa and Africa’s exports to India increasing by around $5 billion during this period. Indian and African economies represent two of the world’s most dynamic economic growth stories. Ambassador Lakhal said among the many sectors in which MoUs were signed including agriculture, business, cyber-security, education, health, green energy; cooperation in space is a “new promising area”. This should open the door that can support sustainable development. On a personal note, having spent some four years here, the Ambassador carries back fondly the lingering taste of Biryani and Chappatis as the top 10 takeaways from India.“I regret not having been able to discover most of Indian treasures…I was lucky to attend the Hemp international festival, and have memories of my trips to Jaipur, Udaipur, Mumbai, Kerala, Dharamsala and Haryana.” Ambassador Lakhal hopes to make up some time to return to visit other famous places including Kashmir that he wants to. “India is a planet and not just a country, and to discover a planet you first need to be lucky, have time and money,” he noted in a matter of fact manner.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-africa-relations-bound-to-improve-tunisian-ambassador-lakhal-168348
09-11-2020||Kolkata||India should build COVID-19 vaccine confidence, identify ‘hesitancy hotspots’, says int’l immunisation expert||India should identify COVID-19 vaccine “hesitancy hotspots” pockets, where people may be unwilling to receive immunisation for varied reasons, and then build vaccine confidence, says anthropologist and international immunisation expert Heidi J Larson.Several global surveys were being conducted about public willingness to take a vaccine, said the professor of Anthropology, Risk and Decision Science at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.“... India must identify hesitancy hotspots and then conduct a vaccine confidence survey,” Larson, who is also founder-director of the Vaccine Confidence Project research group in London, told PTI in an email interview.With many vaccine candidates globally in the final phase of human trials, a safe and effective COVID-19 preventive is expected to be approved for production, distribution and acceptance sometime next year.According to a recent global survey, people in 10 out of 15 countries showed growing reluctance about getting vaccinated. However, Indians are the keenest on getting vaccinated whenever a COVID-19 vaccine is available.In the World Economic Forum/Ipsos survey of 18,526 adults from 15 countries, 73 per cent said they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if available, down from 77 per cent in August.In India, the survey found that vaccination intent has remained unchanged at 87 per cent since August, although 34 per cent respondents were worried about side effects while 16 per cent were concerned about fast-moving trials.According to Larson, there is generalised vaccine hesitancy primarily because of the lack of proper information on the safety and efficacy of any of the possible COVID-19 vaccines. This is due to distrust of governments as well as motives of pharmaceutical companies as they are trying to come out with a vaccine faster than normally done so, she reasoned.“Some of these concerns are understandable as we currently do not have any final information on the safety and efficacy profiles of whichever vaccine may be approved. Other fears are due to distrust of government more broadly or the motives of vaccine companies to produce vaccines more quickly than normal,” she said.“But these vaccines have been able to be developed and tested more quickly because of new technologies. These are not old processes that have been short-cut, they are new processes,” she further noted.According to the anthropologist, certain communities, such as the Muslims, also have issues due to the presence of gelatine, which is derived from pork.“There are religious issues. Such as some Muslims concerned that some vaccines are not halal because they have gelatine which is derived from pork… Although most Muslims agree that vaccines are important to save lives and if there is no alternative, they will accept the very a small amount of gelatine in some vaccines,” she said.On what could be the solution to clear such hesitation, she said: “The most important thing is to understand why people refuse vaccines, only then can you know what the issue is and how to address it.”Larson, who earlier headed the Global Immunisation Communication at UNICEF, noted that “political polarisation, religious extremism and misinformation on the internet and through other media such as radio, newspapers and person-to-person discussions” were a problem for vaccine confidence.“It is important to get accurate information out to the public but some of these issues are not about information, they are about emotions and beliefs which are much more difficult to change,” she said.Larson described the COVID-19 pandemic as a “global health crisis” which can “cause long term problems for individuals”.Asked whether the invention of a COVID vaccine will be able to eradicate the disease, Larson said, “We are unlikely to eradicate COVID-19 for a very long time, if at all.”However, she is hopeful that everyone will be vaccinated by the end of 2021 and suggests that healthcare professionals and frontline workers should be immunised first as they are most at risk.They were also at risk of spreading it to others, she added.“As there are likely not to be enough vaccines for everyone in the world at the same time, there will need to be a decision on who gets the vaccines first,” Larson said.After healthcare workers, older people should be administered the new vaccine for COVID-19.India’s Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan had in early October stated the Centre was planning to vaccinate about 25 crore people against novel coronavirus by July next year.Vardhan had also said priority would be given to health workers engaged in COVID-19 management in getting inoculated and asserted that the Centre would ensure fair and equitable distribution of vaccines, once they were ready.

09-11-2020||Indore||Land occupied by Computer Baba freed by Indore officials||Authorities in Indore in Madhya Pradesh on Monday said they had freed 40,000-square feet of land, worth Rs 13 crore, from the alleged encroachment by spiritual leader Namdevdas Tyagi, better known as Computer Baba.Tyagi, who held ministerial status under the previous Congress government in MP as chairman of Nadi Sanrkashan Nyas (River Conservation Trust), is accused of illegal construction on encroached land.He was arrested on Sunday when the administration was removing encroachment from government land in Jamburdi Hapsi village near Indore, during which a rifle and air pistol were found in his ashram.Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Rajesh Rathore on Monday said illegal construction on 20,000 square feet of land adjacent to a temple in the city's super corridor area was demolished, including those carried out on land included in a scheme of Indore Development Authority (IDA).“The market value of this freed land is around Rs 5 crore. In another move, the administration’s squad freed 20,000 square feet from the baba’s illegal possession in the premises of Shri Dakshin Kali Peeth Trimahavidya temple in Ambikapuri Extension. This land has a market value of Rs 8 crore,” he said.The SDM said Baba had illegally occupied the temple premises and constructed five rooms, all of which had been reclaimed now.These rooms were emptied of Baba’s possessions but have not been demolished and have been handed over to the residents’ association of Ambikapuri Extension Colony for maintenance.“In the approved map of Ambikapur Extension, the place where the temple was built was earmarked for a public garden. However, a temple got built and Computer Baba occupied it,” Rathore said.Additional District Magistrate (ADM) Ajaydev Sharma said the registry of 3.125 hectares of agricultural land in Ajnod village here had been seized and it showed ‘Namdevdas Tyagi aka Computer Baba’ as the buyer.“It is clear from this registry that Computer Baba was involved in the purchase of land in his own name as well.

09-11-2020||New Delhi||Bollywood plea: HC asks Republic TV, Times Now to ensure no defamatory content uploaded||The Delhi High Court Monday asked media houses AGR Outlier Media and Bennett Coleman and Company to ensure that no defamatory content is uploaded on social media or displayed on their channels, while hearing a plea by Bollywood producers seeking to restrain them from making irresponsible remarks.In strong observations while hearing the plea, the high court cited the death of Princess Diana while trying to escape the media chase, and said there needs to be "some toning down" as people are "afraid of the fourth pillar of democracy" because of its powers.The court sought replies from Republic TV, its editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and reporter Pradeep Bhandari, Times Now editor-in-chief Rahul Shivshankar and group editor Navika Kumar, and intermediaries Google, Facebook and Twitter on the plea.Leading Bollywood producers have sought to restrain them from making or publishing allegedly “irresponsible, derogatory and defamatory remarks" against the film industry and conducting media trials against its members on various issues following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.The lawsuit by four Bollywood industry associations and 34 leading producers, has also sought to restrain them from interfering with the right to privacy of persons associated with the industry.Justice Rajiv Shakdher was assured by the counsel for the media houses that they will follow the programme code and the Cable TV Networks (Regulation) Act.The court questioned the plaintiffs for not making individual celebrities parties in the suit and being represented through associations.“If the individuals are affected, why are they not joining the proceedings individually? If individuals are aggrieved, they should come on their own and take steps,” the judge said.To this, senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, representing the producers, the celebrities are members of the associations and said he would take instructions on making them individual parties.The high court issued summons to the media houses and intermediaries and listed the suit for further hearing on December 14.It also asked senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, representing the Bennett Coleman Group, as to what is the next step if the channel does not follow self regulation.“There needs to be some toning down. As an officer of the court, tell me what is the next step if you do not follow self regulation. What do we do about this. Your undertakings to the court does not seem to be working. All of you have to do something. It is disheartening and demoralises everyone," the high court said.“It has to be fair reportage. Tomorrow it could be your (legal) fraternity also. You need to rise above your brief and tell me what should be done,” it said.The high court added that people are afraid of the fourth pillar of democracy because of the power which it has and courts are the last one to interfere in this."In the case of Princess Diana, she died because she was racing away from the media. You can't just go on like this. The Courts are the last ones to want to regulate," the judge said.“See the kind language of language you are using on TV. Participants in the debate are using curse words,” the judge said, adding that neutrality is expected from the media and the black and white Doordarshan era was much better.Nayar said it all started with the suicide of Rajput, which later became a murder, then Bollywood became criminal, then drug peddlers and now ISI marks.“This is how the course of this defamatory -- scurrilous -- I must say, campaign changed,” he argued.The suit said, “This comes in the wake of these channels using highly derogatory words and expressions for Bollywood such as ‘dirt', ‘filth', ‘scum', ‘druggies' and expressions such as ‘it is Bollywood where the dirt needs to be cleaned', ‘all the perfumes of Arabia cannot take away the stench and the stink of this filth and scum of the underbelly of Bollywood', ‘This is the dirtiest industry in the country', and ‘cocaine and LSD drenched Bollywood'.”     Those who have filed the suit are The Film and Television Producers Guild Of India (PGI), The Cine and TV Artistes' Association (CINTAA), Indian Film and TV Producers Council (IFTPC), Screenwriters Association (SWA), Aamir Khan Productions, Ad-Labs Films, Ajay Devgn Fflims,Andolan Films, Anil Kapoor Film and Communication Network, Arbaaz Khan Productions, Ashutosh Gowariker Productions, BSK Network and Entertainment, Cape of Good Films, Clean Slate Filmz and Dharma Productions.The list also includes Emmay Entertainment and Motion Pictures, Excel Entertainment, Filmkraft Productions, Hope Production, Kabir Khan Films, Luv Films, Macguffin Pictures, Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment, One India Stories, R.S. Entertainment, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra Pictures, Red Chillies Entertainment, Reel Life Productions, Reliance Big Entertainment, Rohit Shetty Picturez.The other plaintiffs are Roy Kapur Films, Salman Khan Films, Sikhya Entertainment, Sohail Khan Productions, Tiger Baby Digital, Vinod Chopra Films, Vishal Bhardwaj Pictures and Yashraj Films.“The livelihood of persons associated with Bollywood is being severely impacted by the smear campaign being run by the Defendants,” the plea said.It claimed that the privacy of the members of Bollywood is being invaded and their reputations are being irreparably damaged by painting the entire industry as “criminals, seeped in drug culture, and making being part of Bollywood as synonymous with criminal acts in the public imagination”.

09-11-2020||New Delhi||Justify denial of information; don’t merely cite exemption clause: CIC to CBI||The Central Information Commission (CIC) has directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to provide a justification for denial of information on the ground that the disclosure might impede an ongoing investigation or the prosecution of an accused and not merely cite the relevant clause in its RTI response.Information Commissioner Vanaja N Sarna directed the CBI to provide a cogent explanation while citing the exemption clause — Section 8(1)(h) of the Right to Information (RTI) Act — on how disclosure of the information would adversely affect an investigation or prosecution.Section 8(1)(h) allows a public authority to withhold information, the disclosure of which would impede the process of an investigation or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders.The Delhi High Court, in the Bhagat Singh case, had clearly held that merely citing the exemption clause is not enough and a public authority must justify how disclosure of the information would attract the section as the disclosure was the rule while withholding information was an exception.Sarna was hearing the case of an RTI applicant, who had sought to know the status of a preliminary enquiry by the CBI in the MSME Development Institute in Chennai.The CBI, in a number of cases, has denied the information by merely citing the section, without giving any justification how disclosure of the information would impede its investigation or prosecution.“The Commission observes upon a perusal of the facts on record that the CPIO had merely invoked Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act without providing any justification as to what inquiry was pending as on the date of their reply or as to how the disclosure of the information would have impeded the process of the inquiry or apprehension or prosecution of offenders,” Sarna noted.She agreed with the petitioner, S Harish Kumar, that the disclosure of the status and outcome of the case as available at the relevant time would not have impeded the process of the averred inquiry by any measure.“Pertinently so, the representative of the CPIO also failed to provide any substantial submissions regarding the applicability of Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act during the hearing,” Sarna said.She directed the CBI CPIO to provide a revised reply to Kumar, incorporating a “cogent explanation” justifying the applicability of section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act with respect to the information sought in the application.“In addition to this, the CPIO is directed to provide the available information regarding the status and outcome of the case as referred to in the RTI application...,” Sarna said.

They claimed the ban would promote illegal sale of conventional polluting crackers rather than the safe green ones. "What is the point of introducing green crackers when you have to ban them. The construction activity and stubble burning are the main culprits. Rather than dealing with these issues, we are being made scrapegoats. This will increase the sale of illegal crackers," said Sudheer Manchanda, a cracker distributer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ngt-imposes-nationwide-ban-on-firecrackers-where-air-quality-falls-in-poor-very-poor-severe-categories-168284

On Saturday, the city reported 79 deaths, the highest in over four months.Satyendar Jain, who is on an official visit to Rajasthan’s Dungarpur, said the first wave hit its peak around June 23 and the second on September 17.“The third wave is at its peak in Delhi.

An official statement on Sunday morning said: "Both sides agreed to maintain dialogue through military and diplomatic channels, and, taking forward the discussions at this meeting, push for the settlement of other outstanding issues, so as to jointly maintain peace in border areas." They also agreed to have another round of meeting soon.Sources said the continuing disagreement was over the timeline to be followed for disengagement. The two countries don't have demarcated boundary and the present positions, especially those south of Pangong Tso, are vital for India to dominate the Chinese positions.This was the eighth round of talks since June 6 and the last substantive positive step that emerged was during the 6th round of meeting in September when the two sides agreed not to add more troops at the standoff site."The two sides had a candid, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement," a statement of the Indian Ministry of Defence said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-standoff-talks-fail-yet-again-deadlock-persists-168104
