03-11-2020||New Delhi||LAC row: Eighth round of Sino-India Corps Commander-level talks likely this week||The eighth round of Corps Commander-level talks between India and China is likely to take place this week with an aim to carry forward negotiations on the disengagement process in eastern Ladakh as their troops brace for a harsh winter.There was no breakthrough on the disengagement of troops from the friction points in eastern Ladakh during the seventh round of military talks on October 12.“The eighth round of military talks is likely to take place this week,” said a source on Tuesday.The standoff between the two sides erupted in early May.Temperatures drop to minus 25 degrees Celsius during winter months in the high altitude areas.Last week, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said the ties between India and China have come under “severe stress” and that the agreements inked by both sides on management of the border must be respected “scrupulously” in their “entirety” to restore normalcy in relations.The Indian delegation at the eighth round of military talks will be led by Lt Gen PGK Menon, the newly-appointed Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps.A joint press statement by the two armies after the last round of talks said both sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement “as early as possible”.India has all along been maintaining that the onus is on China to carry forward the process of disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points in the mountainous region.Following the sixth round of military talks, the two sides announced a slew of decisions including not to send more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoid taking any actions that may further complicate matters.The sixth round was held with a specific agenda of exploring ways to implement a five-point agreement reached between Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) conclave.The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated following at least three attempts by Chinese soldiers to “intimidate” Indian troops along the northern and southern bank of Pangong lake area between August 29 and September 8 where even shots were fired in the air for the first time at the LAC in 45 years.As tensions escalated further, the foreign ministers of India and China held talks in Moscow on September 10 where they reached a five-point agreement to defuse the situation in eastern Ladakh. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-row-eighth-round-of-sino-india-corps-commander-level-talks-likely-this-week-165471
03-11-2020||Bhubaneswar||Odisha bans sale, use of firecrackers amid COVID pandemic||The Odisha government on Tuesday banned the sale and use of firecrackers across the state during the festive season to check air pollution, which can aggravate health conditions of COVID-19 patients.The period of the ban is from November 10 to 30, according to a government order.The people of the state burst firecrackers on the occasion of Deepavali and Kartik Purnima, which fell on November 14 and 30 respectively this year.Chief Secretary AK Tripathy issued a direction to prohibit sale and use of firecrackers in all parts of the state from November 10 to 30.“Any person found violating this order shall be punished under the provision of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and other relevant laws,” the order said.“Considering the potentially harmful consequences of burning of crackers amidst COVID-l9 pandemic situation and approaching winter, Government of Odisha, therefore, prohibits the sale and use of fire crackers from 10th to 30th of November, 2020, in public interest,” the chief secretary said.Deepavali is the festival of lights and it may be celebrated in the traditional way by lighting of earthen lamps, candles and other traditional lighting materials.Stating that the spread of COVID-19 pandemic has been controlled in Odisha to a significant extent, the order said that the people at large supported the government in controlling the situation.Though the number of active cases has shown a dip in the state, the danger is still very much present, Tripathy said adding that COVID-19 resurfaced in some parts of the country and in the world forcing them to re-impose lockdowns and other extreme measures to contain the situation and further spread of the disease.Tripathy also pointed out that the international experience shows that the coming winter season may see further spread of the pandemic. It is generally observed that elderly people, children, persons with comorbidities and others develop respiratory problems during winter, he said.This apart, the air pollution, higher concentration of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in the air aggravates the respiratory problems.“It is a well-known fact that burning of the fire crackers releases copious amounts of harmful chemicals like nitrous oxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, which have severe impact on the respiratory health of vulnerable groups,” he said.Such pollutants can further aggravate health conditions of COVID-19 positive persons besides persons staying in home isolation, he said.The chief secretary also issued an instruction to the local administrations and police to take measures for the implementation of the order.

03-11-2020||New Delhi||Elevated food inflation temporary affair; to be back to normal soon: Econmic Affairs Secy Tarun Bajaj||Terming elevated food prices a temporary phenomenon, Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj on Tuesday said it should be back to normal soon on the back of arrival of new crops and government measures for improving supply of essential commodities.Prices of some commodities like onion, potatoes and tomatoes have gone up to Rs 100 per kg, much higher than the average price. Pushed by rising prices of essential kitchen items, retail inflation rose to an eight-month high of 7.34 per cent in September. The Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation was 6.69 per cent in August and 3.99 per cent in September 2019. The inflation has been hovering above 4 per cent since October 2019. The previous high in the CPI was witnessed at 7.59 per cent in January 2020. The Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation rose to 1.32 per cent in September 2020, mainly on the back of costlier food articles.“I think this should be temporary in our view... There is actually a difference between the WPI and the CPI. So, that itself shows that this should be something to do with logistics and with good agricultural season that is coming and the new crop with us we are hoping that this should cool down,” Bajaj said.Nevertheless, he said agriculture and consumer affairs ministries have also announced some steps to cool down the prices.“We think that it is a temporary affair and it should be back to normal soon and also limited to few commodities,” he said.Onion, a politically-sensitive commodity, remained the costliest in the retail markets of Bengaluru at Rs 100 per kg on Monday despite Karnataka being the third-largest producer of the kitchen staple in the country, according to government data.The average all-India daily price of onion was ruling as high as Rs 70 per kg on Monday.Consumers even in the large growing regions are paying elevated rates for the key kitchen item.Despite Maharashtra being the top onion producing state in the country, retail price of the commodity in Mumbai was a hefty Rs 77 per kg. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/elevated-food-inflation-temporary-affair-to-be-back-to-normal-soon-econmic-affairs-secy-tarun-bajaj-165460
03-11-2020||---||Govt defends Central Vista project in SC||New Delhi, November 3The Centre on Tuesday defended before the Supreme Court the Central Vista project, covering a three-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in Lutyens” Delhi, saying it would “save money” paid as rent for housing Central government ministries in the national capital.“Even after 73 year of independence, the nation does not have a central secretariat. Various ministries have hired premises on rent. Thousands of crore of rent is paid for housing central government ministries. This project saves money,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a three-judge Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar.The Bench – which is seized of hearing several PILs, including the one by activist Rajeev Suri, against various permissions given to the project by the authorities including the nod to change of land use—would resume hearing on Wednesday.The Central Vista redevelopment plan – which aims to free up 75 acre land in the heart of the capital – involves demolition of around 10 buildings, including Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan, Vigyan Bhawan, Vice-President’s House and Lok Nayak Bhawan. It is planned that a common central secretariat complex and a new Parliament building would be constructed.Announced in September last year, it envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, expected to be constructed by August 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day. The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024.The Supreme Court had on April 30 refused to stay the project, saying there was no urgency.Asserting that the decision had not been taken in haste and no law or norms had been violated in any manner for the project, Mehta said new parliament building was needed as numerous occupants had indicated the inadequacies in the present structure.Rejecting the criticism from the petitioners who questioned the project over environmental clearance (EC) granted to the project and the historical value of the existing building, he said the existing parliament building was not earthquake proof and the new parliament building would supplement the existing one.Having all the ministries at one place would increase the efficiency and ensure better coordination between them, he said, adding, “If the petitioners concern is regarding any environmental issue, then it has been fully taken care of.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-defends-central-vista-project-in-sc-165459

03-11-2020||New Delhi||SC commutes man’s death sentence for rape, murder of minor girl to life term||The Supreme Court has commuted to life term the death sentence awarded to a man convicted for raping and murdering a two-and-a-half-year old girl in 2013 in Maharashtra.The apex court, which said sexual assault on the minor girl was “very severe” and the conduct of the convict could be termed as “perverse and barbaric”, observed that he did not consciously cause any injury with the intent to extinguish the victim’s life.“We therefore, find that though the appellant (convict) is guilty of the offence punishable under Section 302 (murder) IPC, since there was no requisite intent as would bring the case under any of the first three clauses of Section 300 IPC, the offence in the present case does not deserve death penalty,” a bench headed by Justice U U Lalit said in its 139-page verdict.The bench, while affirming the view taken by the trial court and the high court in convicting the accused who was a maternal uncle of the victim, commuted the sentence to life imprisonment for the offence of murder and 25 years rigorous imprisonment for the offence of rape.The bench, also comprising Justices Indu Malhotra and Krishna Murari, delivered the judgement on an appeal filed by the convict against the October 2015 verdict of Bombay High Court which had confirmed the death sentence awarded to him by a trial court.The bench noted in its judgement that about 67 cases were dealt with by the top court in last 40 years where the offences were of rape and murder and age of the victims were 16 years or below.It said out of these 67 cases, the apex court had affirmed award of death sentence to accused in 15 cases.It said in three out of these 15 cases, death penalty was commuted to life term by the apex court in review petitions.It noted that out of remaining 12 cases, death sentence was confirmed in two cases and review pleas were rejected.The bench said as on date, death sentence was confirmed in 12 out of 67 cases where the principal offences allegedly committed were of rape and murder and victims were aged about 16 years or below.It further said out of these 67 cases, in at least 51 cases the victims were aged below 12 years.The top court said in 12 out of those 51 cases, death sentence was initially awarded.An FIR was lodged in the case by the victim’s father in February 2013 and it was found that there were bite marks on the victim’s body.The accused, who was 21-year-old at the time of incident, had claimed that he was being falsely implicated in the case.“The circumstances proved on record are not only conclusive in nature but completely support the case of the prosecution and are consistent with only one hypothesis and that is the guilt of the appellant (convict). They form a chain, so complete, consistent and clear, that no room for doubt or ground arises pointing towards innocence of the appellant,” the bench said.“The circumstances are clear, consistent and conclusive in nature and are of unimpeachable character in establishing the guilt of the appellant. The evidence on record also depicts an exceptional case where two and half years old girl was subjected to sexual assault. The assault was accompanied by bites on the body of the victim,” the bench said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-commutes-mans-death-sentence-for-rape-murder-of-minor-girl-to-life-term-165454

Wasan posted the video on his YouTube social media account leading to people across the country starting a campaign for providing financial help and support to Prasad to restart his business.Prasad told IANS, "Gaurav has cheated me. He supported me a lot but transferred the donations received from people nationwide to his own bank account instead of transferring the money into my account."Asked what will he do if the allegations against Gaurav prove to be false, Prasad said "I will see what course of action to follow when the time comes. Right now the investigation is on. I will not hesitate to apologise if my claims are proven wrong as Gaurav did a lot of good work for us.""If we are proved wrong during the investigation, we will apologise. We will accept our mistake since he supported us," said Prasad.Food Blogger Gaurav Wasan has denied the allegations saying, "There is absolutely no truth to the frivolous allegations levelled against me. An attempt is being made to malign my reputation. If these charges were true, I wouldn't have come forward to provide proof of my bank statements correctly." Wasan said, "All the money that came into my account has been transferred to Prasad. The police had asked me to reveal my bank statement which I have already given. When Baba comes to know the truth, then finally the outcome will be right.""I cannot be proved wrong since I have the bank statement to back my evidence. If Rs 25 lakh is found in my bank account then only will I be proved false," Vasan added. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/baba-ka-dhaba-owner-says-ready-to-apologise-to-youtuber-if-proven-wrong-165450
03-11-2020||Allahabad||HC asks Shamli SP to give protection to a same-sex couple||The Allahabad High Court on Monday ordered the Shamli superintendent of police to provide security to a same-sex couple allegedly facing resistance and harassment from the family and society.A Division Bench of justices S K Gupta and Pankaj Bhatia gave the direction on a plea by Sultana Mirza and Kiran Rani of Shamli.The petitioners said they have been in a live-in relationship for several years but facing resistance from their family and society because of their sexual orientation.In their pleas, they also apprehended harassment and threat to their lives because of their relationship.Petitioners relied on Navtej Singh Johar case in which the Supreme Court considered the plight of LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender).The Bench gave its order relying on the principles laid down by the apex court in the case that any kind of discrimination based on the sexual orientation of a person is unconstitutional.In the Johar case, the apex court had also ruled that “the sexual orientation is an intrinsic element of liberty, dignity, privacy, individual autonomy and equality, and the intimacy between consenting adults of the same sex is beyond the legitimate interests of the state”.While allowing the petition, the Bench said that “a constitutional court is duty-bound to monitor and observe the constitutional morality as well as rights of the citizen which are under threat only on account of the sexual orientation”.“We direct the Shamli superintendent of police to extend suitable protection to the petitioners in the event they approach for necessary protection and ensure that no harassment is caused to them,” the court ruled. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-asks-shamli-sp-to-give-protection-to-a-same-sex-couple-165448

03-11-2020||New Delhi||Overqualified for job: SC upholds disqualification of graduate peon at bank||The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to accept the contention that overqualification cannot be a ground for disqualification as it upheld an order of the Punjab National Bank terminating the service of a peon who had suppressed the fact that he was a graduate.The top court set aside two orders of the Orissa High Court by which it had asked the bank to allow the peon to discharge his service, saying “a candidate having suppressed the material information and/or giving false information cannot claim the right to continuance in service”.A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah allowed the appeal filed by the bank, noting that it had stated in its job advertisement that the applicant should not be a graduate.The court also observed that instead of challenging the qualification criteria, Amit Kumar Das had applied for the job and hidden his qualification.On the ground that Das “deliberately, wilfully and intentionally suppressed the fact that he was a graduate, the High Court has erred in directing the appellant Bank to allow the respondent - original writ petitioner - to discharge his duties as a peon”, the court said.Referring to an earlier verdict of the top court, the bench said the suppression of material information and making a false statement have a clear bearing on the character and antecedents of the employee in relation to his continuance in service.It said, “An employee is expected to give correct information as to his qualification. The original writ petitioner failed to do so. He was, in fact, overqualified and therefore ineligible to apply for the job.”The top court said another righteous candidate has suffered due to this mischievous act by Das.Das relied on the top court’s verdict of 2000 and said a higher qualification cannot be a ground for his disqualification from the job as rightly held by the Orissa High Court.The bench noted that the Bank has invited the applications for the post of peon by giving a newspaper advertisement in which it was specifically mentioned that a candidate should have passed 12th class or its equivalent with basic reading/writing knowledge of English and should not be a graduate as on January 1, 2016.It said that as per the eligibility criteria mentioned in the advertisement, a candidate with a graduate degree was not eligible even to apply. The bench said Das applied for the post of peon but in his application/bio-data did not disclose that he was a graduate degree holder since 2014 and only mentioned his qualification as 12th pass.It said looking at the nature of the post of peon, a conscious decision was taken by the bank providing eligibility criteria/educational qualification that a graduate candidate shall not be eligible for the post of peon/subordinate staff.The top court said that Das never challenged the eligibility criteria/educational qualification mentioned in the advertisement and instead participated in the recruitment process.  “Therefore, once having participated in the recruitment process as per the advertisement, thereafter it is not open for him to contend that acquisition of higher qualification cannot be a disqualification and that too when he never challenged the eligibility criteria/educational qualification mentioned in the advertisement,” it said.The top court stated that it is for the employer to determine and decide the relevancy and suitability of the qualifications for any post and it is not for the courts to consider and assess.“Greater latitude is permitted by the courts for the employer to prescribe qualifications for any post. There is a rationale behind it.“Qualifications are prescribed keeping in view the need and interest of an institution or an industry or an establishment as the case may be. The courts are not fit instruments to assess expediency or advisability or utility of such prescription of qualifications,” it said.The bench, however, said at the same time, the employer cannot act arbitrarily or fancifully in prescribing qualifications for the posts.“Therefore, the High Court has clearly erred in directing the appellant Bank to allow the respondent original writ petitioner to discharge his duties as a peon, though he as such was not eligible as per the eligibility criteria/educational qualification mentioned in the advertisement,” it said.It noted that Das in his bio-data did not mention that he was a graduate and “very cleverly” he suppressed the material fact and declared his qualification as Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC), whereas as he was holding a degree in the Bachelor in Arts.“Had it been known to the bank that he was a graduate, he would not have at all been considered for selection as a Peon in the bank. That thereafter when scrutiny of the documents was going on and when the respondent - original writ petitioner produced a graduation certificate, at that time, the bank came to know that he was a graduate and therefore not eligible,” it said.The top court said that therefore the bank rightly cancelled his candidature and he was not allowed to join the bank in the subordinate cadre.The court said it was not imposing costs on Das though his mischievous act had deprived another candidate of the job.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/overqualified-for-job-sc-upholds-disqualification-of-graduate-peon-at-bank-165437

The ruling TRS has fielded his widow Solipeta Sujatha from the constituency.The Congress has fielded Cheruku Srinivas Reddy, who defected to the party from TRS, just ahead of the by-poll. The BJP, meanwhile, has given ticket to M Raghunandan Rao, who lost in Dubbak in the previous Assembly elections. Speaking to the media, District Collector Bharathi Holliker said the polling was been peaceful and voters’ turnout was impressive.She pointed out that delay in few places was inevitable as the election officers were bound to impose COVID regulations. “Thermal screening, social distancing and distribution of gloves took time,” she explained.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-by-poll-over-80-per-cent-polling-till-5-pm-165436
03-11-2020||New Delhi||India, US, Japan and Australia kick-start Malabar naval exercise in Bay of Bengal||The navies of India, the US, Japan and Australia on Tuesday held a series of complex manoeuvres in the Bay of Bengal, kick-starting the four-day-long first phase of the Malabar naval exercise, seen as a prelude to future military cooperation among the member nations of the Quad or Quadrilateral Coalition.The mega exercise is taking place at a time India and China are locked in a nearly six-month-long bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh.Japan, Australia and the US—the three other participants of the exercise—too are having fractious ties with China in the last few months over a range of contentious issues.“Several complex military drills were conducted on the first day of the exercise in the Bay of Bengal,” a military official said.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among the leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China’s growing assertiveness.In a tweet, the US Embassy said the exercise reaffirmed the commitment of the participating countries to stronger defence cooperation in the Indo Pacific region.Last month, India announced that Australia will be part of the Malabar exercise.The first segment of the exercise is from November 3 to 6 while the second phase of the drill is scheduled to be held from November 17 to 20 in the Arabian sea.“The exercise, being conducted as a non-contact, at sea only’ exercise in view of COVID-19 pandemic, will showcase the high-levels of synergy and coordination between the friendly navies, which is based on their shared values and commitment to an open, inclusive Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order,” the Indian Navy had said in a statement on Monday.Meanwhile, China on Tuesday hoped that the quadrilateral Malabar exercises would be conducive to the regional peace and stability instead of the contrary.“We hope that relevant countries’ military operations will be conducive to peace and stability in the region instead of the contrary,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing in Beijing.The invitation by India to the Australian Navy for the exercise came two weeks after foreign ministers of the ‘Quad’ member nations held extensive talks in Tokyo with a focus on enhancing their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, a region where China has been expanding its military influence.The first phase of the exercise would witness complex and advanced naval drills like anti-submarine and anti-air warfare operations, cross deck flying, seamanship evolutions and weapon firings.The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent member of the exercise in 2015.The annual exercise was conducted off the coast of Guam in the Philippine Sea in 2018 and off the coast of Japan in 2019.The Indian Navy deployed a number of its key platforms including destroyer Ranvijay, frigate Shivalik, off-shore patrol vessel Sukanya, fleet support ship Shakti and submarine Sindhuraj.Also, advanced jet trainer Hawk, long-range maritime patrol aircraft P-8I, Dornier maritime patrol aircraft, and several helicopters are participating in the exercise, officials said.US Navy ship USS John S McCain, a guided-missile destroyer, Australian Navy’s long-range frigate HMAS Ballarat with integral MH-60 helicopter and Japan Maritime Self Defence Force’s JS Onami, a destroyer, are among the platforms participating in the first phase of the exercise, they said.During the recent Indo-US 2+2 talks, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper welcomed India’s invitation to Australia to join the Malabar exercise.For the last few years, Australia has been showing keen interest in participating in the exercise.In June, India and Australia elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and signed a landmark deal for reciprocal access to military bases for logistics support during an online summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison.The Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) allows militaries of the two countries to use each other’s bases for repair and replenishment of supplies, besides facilitating scaling up of overall defence cooperation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-japan-and-australia-kick-start-malabar-naval-exercise-in-bay-of-bengal-165433

Gen Naravane will attend a dinner reception hosted by Nepal Army chief at Nepal Army headquarters.Gen Naravane will address the student officers at the Army Command and Staff College at Shivapuri, in the outskirts of Kathmandu on Friday morning.In the afternoon, Gen. Naravane will meet Prime Minister and Defence Minister K.P. Sharma Oli at the Prime Minister’s Official Residence at Baluwatar before wrapping up his visit.India’s decision to send the Army Chief to Nepal to reset the ties is seen as part of a larger exercise by New Delhi to rejuvenate relations with Myanmar, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan in the wake of greater efforts by China to expand its influence in the region.The ties between the two countries came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory. Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories.After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a “unilateral act” and cautioning Kathmandu that such “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it.In June, Nepal’s Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring areas which India maintains belong to it.In its reaction after Nepal’s lower house of parliament approved the bill, India termed as untenable the “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims by the neighbouring country.India said Nepal’s action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks.Nepal Prime Minister Oli has been asserting that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to Nepal and vowed to “reclaim” them from India.The Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India.Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory - India as part of Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Dharchula district. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-chief-gen-mm-naravane-to-begin-3-day-nepal-visit-on-wednesday-165430
03-11-2020||New Delhi||CPI MP writes to EC, alleges poll code violation by PM in run up to Bihar elections||Communist Party of India MP Binoy Viswam has written to the Election Commission alleging violation of the Model Code of Conduct by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the run up to the Bihar Assembly polls.Referring to news reports, Viswam claimed that the Prime Minister's Office, in a newsletter sent via its official PR email, solicited funds for the work of the Bharatiya Janata Party.In its newsletter on October 21, the PMO has made an advertisement stating "support those who put India first. Support BJP through micro-donations". On clicking on the link one is redirected to another page that solicits funds ranging from Rs 5 to Rs 1000 for the BJP, Viswam alleged."While such misuse of power and position is condemnable at all times, it becomes particularly egregious given that the poll code came into effect for the Bihar elections on September 25. Chapter 7 of the Model Code of Conduct on 'Party in Power' clearly states that the Government machinery and offices shall not be used for furtherance of the interest of the party in power."The soliciting of funds for the BJP via the office of the prime minister is a prima facie violation of the MCC. To ensure the conduct of free and fair elections is the primary objective of the Election Commission," the Left party MP said.He further said it is incumbent upon the Election Commission to investigate the matter and take necessary action if any violation of the poll code has taken place."It is my hope that the investigation into the same will be conducted expeditiously and in a non-partisan manner," Viswam said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cpi-mp-writes-to-ec-alleges-poll-code-violation-by-pm-in-run-up-to-bihar-elections-165427

Many of them haven't returned to their previous job places.Training his guns at the RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav who has made promise of providing 10 lakh government jobs, Kumar asked "when they got the opportunity to serve the state for 15 years, they could just provide 95,000 jobs when Jharkhand was also part of the state for 10 years (till 2000) and we have given six lakh jobs to the people during our time.This is not the first instance when Kumar had to face a hostile crowd at his rallies in course of campaigning.At many places a section of the crowd disrupted his speech, on which Kumar lost his cool and chided them for "acting on behalf of his political rivals" and telling them that nobody is bothered even if they dont vote for him.A slipper was thrown at Kumar by protestors while he was going towards his helicopter after completing speech at an election meeting at Sakra in Muzaffarpur district On October 26, but it missed the target.Police had taken four persons in custody on the charge of creating disturbances at the chief ministers rally.Similarly, Kumar lost his cool at an election rally at Parsa in Saran district on October 21 where he had gone to stump for his party candidate Chandrika Roy, father of Lalu Prasad's elder son Tej Pratap Yadav's estranged wife Aishwarya Rai.Kumar lost temper when a section of the crowd chanted "Lalu Zindabad" in that rally and asked the protestors to stop it or leave the venue."Do not make such noise here. If you do not want to vote for us, dont do it," Kumar had told the slogan shouters.

This what we have been telling the states. We have also been telling them to guard against a potential future surge in cases during festivals, and to protect past gains," said the Health Secretary.India’s recoveries have crossed 76 lakh—which is the highest global recovery.The national recovery rate has reached 92 per cent, and deaths per million, and cases per million in India, remain among the lowest globally.Bhushan said, that there had been a continuous decline, nationally, in the average daily deaths over the last seven weeks, and the average daily cases noticed the same.While the average daily new deaths have fallen from 1,165 from September 16 to 22 week to 513, the average daily cases from October 28 to November 3 have dropped from 90,346 to 45,884."Overall the situation is under control, but the rise is seen in Gurugram, Faridabad and NCR regions. Haryana, recently, reported serosurvey results, which showed 15 per cent of people had been affected by COVID. This means 85 pc are still susceptible to the virus, and we must therefore follow COVID appropriate behaviour to break the chain of transmission,” said a member of Health NITI Aayog VK Paul.He asked people to get tested as soon as a single symptom of COVID appeared."Don't lose time," said Pual, adding, that masks were a good, and even bigger than vaccines for protection.“What would be the efficacy of a COVID vaccine? It would be between 50 to 70 pc. Science tells us, that masks are as good and even better protection than a vaccine,” said Paul.The government further ruled out any punitive laws to enforce COVID behaviour with Health Secretary, saying “we believe in people’s wisdom to take precautions".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/overall-covid-under-control-says-government-delhi-gurugram-faridabad-witness-spike-165415

03-11-2020||New Delhi||46 pc Indians borrowed to run households in COVID-19: Report||Nearly half of Indians have primarily depended upon borrowed money to run their households during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report.With job losses and pay cuts across industries, the lower middle-income group has been affected severely and the pandemic has led to a shift in perspective towards loans and borrowing preferences, said a report by Home Credit India, a local arm of the international consumer finance provider with operations spanning over Europe and Asia.The report, based on a survey, showed that 46 per cent respondents borrowed money primarily to run their households.The survey was conducted among about 1,000 respondents across seven cities to understand the borrowing patterns of people during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, it said."The impact of the pay cuts or delays was the next big reason why most borrowers resorted to borrowing, 27 per cent of respondents cited repayment of their monthly instalments from the earlier loan as the second-biggest reason behind borrowing."About 14 per cent of the respondents borrowed as they suffered job losses," it said.The report also showed that unlike normal times, people during the COVID-19 pandemic had preferred to borrow money from their friends and families as it gave them the flexibility to return the money when the situation normalises and jobs or salaries were restored.The report also showed that 50 per cent of the respondents admitted to returning the borrowed sum once the situation normalises or they returned to their jobs. About 13 per cent of the people said they would look at returning the sum after paying their loan amounts, it said.Borrowing from friends and family was seen highest in Mumbai and Bhopal at 27 per cent each, followed by Delhi at 26 per cent and Patna at 25 per cent, it said.The report also showed that the decision to borrow money from family and friends was led by the male members of the households at 23 per cent.

Bihar ki har maa aur beti NDA ko ashirvaad de rahi hai (All mothers and daughters of Bihar are giving blessings to the NDA),” he said, referring to himself as a “gareeb maa ka beta” (son of a poor mother).On Sunday, he attributed the good turnout in Phase-1 to ‘maa’, ‘behan’ and ‘betis’ of Bihar.“Women are ensuring NDA’s win,” he said, going on to ask ‘maa’ to prepare for upcoming “Chhath puja” as her son in Centre was looking after her interests.Though the BJP/NDA appears to be quite upbeat about forming the next government in Bihar, political observers engaged with grass-roots are talking of what they refer as “silence of women voters in these elections”.The “silence” may be a cause of worry for Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for whom increase in voting by women is among the reasons attributed for his repeated successes, they say.For the BJP, the Bihar elections are a verdict on not just the performance of the Nitish Kumar government but also one on the Centre and its performance during the Covid times, jobs, economy, welfare schemes etc.This is believed to be the reason for the special attention on women, a section which many say often works independent of usual caste-based voting patternsNitish Kumar’s decision to impose prohibition was said to be guided by the opinion of this very support base which constitutes around 47 per cent of voters.However, prohibition is a move he doesn’t talk about much primarily “because there is not much there to talk about” say observers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-women-are-silent-this-time-observers-claim-165406

Type 2 diabetes results when cells lose their ability to use insulin due to a variety of reasons. Insulin resistance is intricately linked to a condition called hyperinsulinemia, in which there is excess insulin traversing the bloodstream. The relationship between insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia is cyclic - each increases the occurrence of the other," said Prosenjit Mondal, Associate Professor, School of Basic Sciences, IIT Mandi."While it is obvious how insulin resistance leads to hyperinsulinemia - when cells cannot use the insulin, it just remains in the blood - the converse of how hyperinsulinemia increases insulin resistance has hitherto remained unclear. We have known that one of the causes of insulin resistance is inflammation," he added.The researchers identified a critical protein molecule - SIRT1 which is repressed in hyperinsulinemia. "The team has found that low dose naltrexone (LDN), a drug commonly administered for opiate addiction, can activate SIRT1, thereby reducing inflammation and increasing insulin sensitivity of cells.The significance of this discovery is enormous," Mondal said.Naltrexone is already an Food and Drug Administration-approved drug that is used for the treatment of opioid addiction and can easily be repurposed for inflammation reduction and diabetes control."The research team intends to study this thread further to understand the mechanistic aspects of LDN's effects on hyperinsulinemia-induced inflammation and resulting insulin resistance," he said.

It also moved an application seeking her presence during the hearing.Prakash's lawyer Abad Ponda said she was ready to cooperate with the investigation and to remain present at the NCB office.The prosecution assured the court that the NCB will not take any "coercive action" (such as arrest) against her till the next date of hearing.Judge G B Gurao adjourned the matter for hearing on November 7.The NCB, which had questioned Prakash earlier in September, has summoned her again "to join the investigation" but she did not turn up.City police had said on Monday that Prakash was "untraceable".According to NCB sources, Prakash was summoned again after the central agency allegedly seized 1.7 gm of hashish during a search at her residence here last month.The NCB, which is probing the alleged nexus between drug peddlers and Bollywood celebrities which came to light after actor Sushant Singh Rajput's suicide in June, had summoned Prakash on October 28.The NCB has already recorded statements of Deepika and fellow actors Sara Ali Khan and Shraddha Kapoor in the case.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wont-act-against-deepika-padukones-manager-till-bail-hearing-ncb-to-court-165400

Because they don’t trust EVMs.“Why? Because the chip in it can be hacked, Singh tweeted and posted a news item mentioning the list of countries using these devices.Reacting to Singh’s tweet, Chouhan, while talking to reporters at the BJPs state headquarters here, said, “The Congress has started making ground for its imminent defeat in the bypolls by blaming the EVMs. Digvijaya Singh is raising questions on the EVMs now.”Chouhan said, “These are the same EVMs that led to the Congress victory on 114 seats in MP in 2018. These EVMs were fine at that time. “The BJP leader said the same EVMs were used in the 2018 assembly polls in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, where the results went in favour of the Congress.The ruling BJP and the opposition Congress are locked in a bitter fight for supremacy in the bypolls in Madhya Pradesh.The BJP has to win at least nine of the 28 seats to reach the halfway mark (116) in the 230-member state assembly. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-day-of-bypolls-in-mp-digvijaya-questions-use-of-evms-165399

Manikandan, a shopkeeper near the temple.He said more than 15 cars and motorcycles, belonging to reporters working for local and international media outlets, had assembled in Thulasendrapuram to cover the ritual.R.R. Kalidas Vandayar, a businessman and the head of a cricket association in the nearest town, plans to offer food to more than 150 people to seek their blessings for Harris, who is running alongside Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden."She is from here, and we are proud of her," said Vandayar's brother R.R. Jayakumar Vandayar.Hundreds of miles north in Delhi, nearly two dozen members of a group known as Hindu Sena (Hindu Army) joined a priest wearing saffron robes to conduct fire rituals and chant verses for Trump's victory.They held up pictures of the leader with one of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi resting to the side."India can fight terrorism only if Trump is around, and both China and Pakistan will stay restrained as long as he is the president," the group's founder, Vishnu Gupta, said by 'phone."We wish Harris well because of her Indian ancestry, but vice presidents are not as powerful." — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prayers-for-kamala-harris-in-ancestral-indian-village-for-donald-trump-in-delhi-165383

03-11-2020||Washington||Irrespective of winner of presidential polls, India-US relationship to remain strong||Irrespective of the outcome of Tuesday’s keenly-contested US presidential election, America’s strategic relationship with India is expected to maintain the current momentum and strengthen further, policy documents and remarks from the two campaigns indicate.President Donald Trump, in the first term of his presidency, has emerged as the best friend of India at the White House, taking the relationship to a new level and his friendship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi is well known, which was reflected in the two leaders addressing two joint rallies in the US and India in less than a year.Highlighting the great relationship that he has developed with Modi, Trump in September said he had “great support from India”.“Prime Minister Modi is a friend of mine and he’s doing a very good job. Nothing easy, but he’s done a very good job,” Trump said as he recollected his historic address at the ‘Howdy Mody’ event in Houston last September.Former vice president Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, has a strong track record of being an ardent advocate of a strong India-US relationship both as a Senator from Delaware for over three decades and then as deputy of president Barack Obama for eight years.From playing a key role in the passage of India-US civil nuclear deal during a Republican administration to setting up the goal of a $500 billion in bilateral trade, Biden has strong ties with Indian leadership across the aisle and has a large number of Indian Americans within his close circuit.At a fundraiser in July, Biden had said India and the United States were natural partners.“That partnership, a strategic partnership, is necessary and important in our security,” he said when asked whether India is critical to the US’ national security.Referring to his eight years as the vice president, Biden said he was proud to have played a role in securing Congressional approval for the US-India Civil Nuclear Agreement, which he said was a “big deal”.“Helping open the door to great progress in our relationship and strengthening our strategic partnership with India was a high priority in the Obama-Biden administration and will be a high priority if I’m elected president,” Biden had said.The ground for India-US relationship post November 3 was laid down during the recently concluded 2+2 ministerial held in New Delhi.Officials from the two countries, both during and after the ministerial, underscored that the ties have bipartisan support and it is not based on which party occupies the White House or has a majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate.It is very well expected that there could be a change in the nuances or emphasis on certain elements of the relationship, on who occupies the White House or have majority in the Congress, the common national interest of the two countries in terms of democracy and threat being posed by China, would drive the momentum between India and the US.Under the Trump administration, defence and energy are being identified as two key pillars of the strategic relationship, along with the cooperation and collaboration in the health sector in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. However, differences on issues related to bilateral trade, foreign workers visas would continue to remain.Notably, India is the only major country with which the Trump administration failed to arrive at a trade deal, even a mini-trade deal, despite the fact the top leadership of both India and the US expressed their desire to do so. Given the track record of differences between the two countries for the last three decades, the sharp differences are likely to remain the same even during a Biden administration.However, the bilateral trade is likely to grow at a fast pace between India and the US, irrespective of who comes to power. Officials from the two countries are likely to pick up the thread from the trade negotiations that they have almost concluded this year.India will continue to place massive orders towards the purchase of defence equipment and take the bilateral energy trade to a new level.Under a Biden administration, climate change would emerge as another pillar of co-operation. Because of domestic political compulsions, human rights issues are expected to gain more prominence under a Biden-Harris administration, which could emerge as a bump on the road for India-US ties.It is similar to that of the H-1B issue and issues such as taxation in India, under the second term of the Trump administration. But none of the issues during either a Biden or a Trump administration are likely to be a deal-breaker.Biden, this week, announced to convene a global summit of democracies in the first year of his presidency to counter the “rising authoritarianism” in the world and address issues of election security and human rights.India, obviously, will play a key role in this summit. Similarly, under the Trump administration, India is likely to be a key partner of the US as it ramps up its global mobilisation against aggressive Chinese behaviour, especially in the strategic Indo-Pacific region.It is expected that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be among the first few world leaders to talk over phone and congratulate the winner as soon as it is known who would occupy the White House for the next four years.

But if the Governor does not pass the order, what the court can do, you tell us”.It asked Shankarnarayanan to apprise the court as to how it can request the Governor to take a decision and what are the laws on the issue.The top court then asked advocate Balaji Srinivasan, appearing for Tamil Nadu, as to why the state government could not request the Governor to pass the order without any specific order from this court?Srinavasan said the Governor had sought report of the MDMA.The bench then told ASG KM Nataraj, appearing for Centre, as to whether any request had been made by the state to send the report of the MDMA.He replied that the larger conspiracy probe was going on and the investigation was spread over various countries like in the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka.The bench told the ASG that the larger conspiracy theory was to find out if any other person, besides those convicted in the matter, were involved in this.“It is not with respect to those who are convicted and are in jail. You look at it,” the bench told Nataraj, adding that the larger conspiracy probe was pending for almost 20 years.It said even after almost two decades of probe in the larger conspiracy aspect, the Centre was saying that it was in the process of getting a response for Letter Rogatories (letters of request from a court to a foreign court for some type of judicial assistance) sent to various countries.“You (Nataraj) look at it and tell us,” the bench said, while posting the matter for further hearing on November 23.The bench allowed the petitioner and the Union of India to file additional documents, if any in the matter.The state government had earlier told the top court that the Cabinet had already passed a resolution on September 9, 2018, and recommended to the Governor for the premature release of all seven convicts in the case.On January 21, the Apex Court had asked the state government to inform whether a decision had been taken by it on a pardon petition of a convict in the case.The MDMA was set up in 1998 on the recommendations of the Justice MC Jain Commission of Inquiry which had probed the conspiracy aspect of Gandhi’s assassination.Perarivalan’s counsel had earlier said his role was only limited to procuring nine-volt batteries, which were allegedly used in the improvised explosive device (IED) that had killed Gandhi.On March 14 last year, the Apex Court had asked the MDMA to file a status report with regard to an LRs sent to Sri Lanka for examining one of the accused, Nixon alias Suren, who is lodged in a Colombo jail.The top court had earlier dismissed a plea of Perarivalan seeking recall of the May 11, 1999, verdict upholding his conviction.It had said the material brought on record before it did not inspire confidence to interfere with the verdict, in which Perarivalan and three others were initially awarded death sentence, which was later commuted to life term.The CBI had earlier submitted that Perarivalan had even visited Jaffna in Sri Lanka in the first week of June 1990, besides attending a public meeting along with other conspirators which was addressed by former prime minister VP Singh on May 7, 1991, in Tamil Nadu.Perarivalan’s counsel had submitted that he was just a 19-year-old when the incident took place and had no knowledge of what he was doing and for what purpose the batteries were purchased.Gandhi was assassinated on the night of May 21, 1991, at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu by a woman suicide bomber, identified as Dhanu, at a poll rally.Fourteen others, including Dhanu herself, were also killed. Gandhi’s assassination was perhaps the first case of suicide bombing which had claimed the life of a high-profile leader.In its May 1999 order, the top court had upheld the death sentence of four convicts —Perarivalan, Murugan, Santham and Nalini — in the assassination case.In April 2000, the Tamil Nadu governor had commuted the death sentence of Nalini on the basis of the state government’s recommendation and an appeal by former Congress president and Rajiv Gandhi’s widow Sonia Gandhi.On February 18, 2014, the top court had commuted the death sentence of Perarivalan to life imprisonment, along with that of two other prisoners — Santhan and Murugan — on the grounds of 11-year delay in deciding their mercy pleas by the Centre.

The residences of Hindus were attacked after a Bangladeshi man, who lives in France, allegedly praised President Emmanuel Macron for taking steps against “inhuman ideologies” after a teacher in Paris was beheaded and the recent knife attack incident inside a church in France.A PTI report from Dhaka said that five people have been arrested in connection with the violence and a mobile court has sentenced each of them to one and half years of imprisonment after identifying the culprits from video footage..||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/adhir-ranjan-chowdhury-praises-hasina-for-stern-action-against-rioters-who-attacked-hindu-homes-165347

There are several states such as Gujarat and Uttarakhand which have not sent even a single Congress representative to Delhi. People have not allowed them to step inside the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. That’s how much angry they are with them. This is because they say something and do something else,” the Prime Minister said reiterating the commitment of the NDA towards “development, good governance” and making Bihar “atmanirbhar”.Thanking the Election Commission, the police personnel and the administration for conducting the elections in these difficult times, he said: “The people of Bihar are giving a message on democracy to the entire world, to think tanks and to opinion makers. The entire world is surprised with the conduct of these elections.”Highlighting the achievements of the NDA government, he said: “The people of Bihar have declared that the state is getting NDA government again. The people have rejected jungle raj, double-double yuvraj,” he said, castigating the “corrupt and greedy” Opposition and reminding the people of the “loot and lawlessness” during the regime of the RJD, which is contesting with the Congress and the Left.The two rallies on Tuesday are expected to be his last in the state. The PM has addressed 10 rallies in Bihar earlier.The first elections in the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the verdict is expected to have a nationwide message on the Centre’s policies.The constituencies polling today are tough seats for the NDA as the majority of areas polling today are the ones beset by migrant labour and flood issues.Amid a definite anti-incumbency against the Nitish Kumar government, the BJP is hoping to do well on seats having straight fights with the Congress aided by the very active push of the Prime Minister.While the Prime Minister appears to be drawing traction, another problem for the BJP appears to be “silence of women” in these elections, a reason why he has been taking special efforts to woo them.Speaking in his election rallies, senior leaders, including BJP president JP Nadda, have been reiterating the commitment of the Modi government towards the welfare of women. The government transferred Rs 500 to 20 crore women for three months during lockdown through jandhan accounts, they say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-campaigns-for-third-phase-in-bihar-concentrates-on-women-voters-says-maa-behan-beti-supporting-nda-165342
03-11-2020||Mumbai||BJP MLA seeks police action against Amitabh over KBC question about Manusmriti||A BJP MLA in Maharashtra on Tuesday approached police seeking action against megastar Amitabh Bachchan and makers of TV show 'Kaun Banega Crorepati 12' for allegedly hurting Hindu sentiments.Abhimanyu Pawar, BJP legislator from Ausa in Latur district, in a complaint to Latur SP Nikhil Pingle said action should be taken against Bachchan and Sony Entertainment Television over a question asked during Friday's Karamveer special episode."There was an attempt to insult Hindus and create discord between Hindus and Buddhists who have been living in harmony," Pawar tweeted, posting a copy of his two-page letter to the police official.The episode had social activist Bezwada Wilson and actor Anup Soni in the hot seat opposite Bachchan, who asked the following question, worth Rs 6.40 lakh: On 25th December 1927, Dr B R Ambedkar and his followers burned copies of which scripture?The options were: (A) Vishnu Purana (B) Bhagavad Gita, (C) Rigved and (D) Manusmriti.Bachchan then said, "In 1927, Ambedkar condemned the ancient Hindu text Manusmriti to ideologically justify caste discrimination and untouchability and burned its copies.""All the four options pertained to Hindu religion. It is clear that the motive behind this question was to hurt the sentiments of Hindus," Pawar said in his police complaint."This question spreads the message that Hindu religious scriptures are meant for burning and triggers enmity between Hindus and followers of Buddhism," said Pawar, who was a close aide of Devendra Fadnavis while he was Maharashtra chief minister.The KBC episode question annoyed some netizens who accused the show of running a "leftist propaganda", while others said it hurt Hindu sentiments.Filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri shared a clip from the show on micro-blogging site Twitter, claiming KBC was "hijacked by Commies". "Innocent kids, learn this is how culture wars are won. Its called coding," he tweeted.

03-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's minimum temp drops to 10 degrees Celsius, cold wave already?||As the minimum temperature in Delhi dropped to 10 degrees Celsius, the season's lowest so far, on Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said it will declare a cold wave in the city if the situation persists for another day.The weather department also said the month of November this year is expected to be the coldest in the last four to five years.“The trend of below normal minimum temperature continues. A similar situation is expected to prevail for another four to five days,” Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of IMD, said.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days.“The criteria for Tuesday has been met. We will declare a cold wave in Delhi if the situation persists on Wednesday,” Srivastava said.He said the month of November this year is expected to be the coldest in the last four to five years.Normally, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, records a minimum of 14.8 degrees Celsius in the first week of November.The mercury dips to 11-12 degrees Celsius by the last week of November, according to IMD officials.The senior IMD scientist said the minimum temperature is expected to be recorded in single digits in the next three to four days.Delhi has been witnessing a trend of low minimum temperatures due to the absence of cloud cover, he said.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.Also, there has been snowfall in the higher reaches of Himachal Pradesh in the last three to four days, so cold winds from that region have started affecting Delhi's weather, he said.On Monday, the city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.8 degrees Celsius.The month of October was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital, according to IMD.  The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962 when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius, it said.  Normally, Delhi records a mean minimum temperature of 19.1 degrees Celsius in October.

03-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi couple killed minor niece to hide ‘rape attempt’; hid body in bed box: Cops||A man and his wife have been arrested for allegedly killing their 17-year-old niece by hitting on her head with an iron rod and later stuffing her body inside a bed box at their house in northeast Delhi's Nandnagri area, police said on Monday.The minor girl was living with Vakeel Podar (51) and his 45-year-old wife for some time now and was pursuing her studies from Delhi, they said.A decomposed body of the girl found stuffed inside a bed at a house in Leprosy colony complex in Tahirpur area of Nandnagri in northeast Delhi was recovered on October 25, police said.According to the police, the girl had been missing since October 23.Statement of the girl's aunt was recorded and it came to notice that the woman's husband, Podar, was also missing from the house and this rose suspicion, they said.During initial investigation, the victim's aunt told police that on October 23, she left for begging at 5.30 am and when she returned at around 12.30 pm, she didn't find her niece at home. She enquired the same from her husband Podar, who informed her that he had left her niece in the orphanage at Ghaziabad, police said.During further investigation, it came to notice that Podar was not seen in the locality since October 23, Ved Prakash Surya, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northeast), said.On making an enquiry at the said orphanage in Ghaziabad, it came to light that no girl of the said name was brought there on October 23, he said."During investigation, it was revealed that Podar was attracted towards the victim and the girl had confided the same to one of the neighbours. It also came to light that Podar's wife was also aware that her husband had tried to molest the victim on September 28," the DCP said.On the basis of analysis of call detail record of Podar, one team was sent to Hyderabad and another to his native place in Bihar. He was arrested from a bus stand in Madhepura, Bihar. He was brought to Delhi on transit remand and produced before the court, the officer said."During interrogation, Podar confessed that the victim was the daughter of his sister-in-law. He had tried to make physical relationship with her one month ago but she objected. When his wife came to know about the incident, she confronted him and they had a quarrel. Although Podar wanted the girl to stay with them, it was decided that she should be sent to the village, to which the victim refused since she wanted to pursue her studies and complete her education. On this, Podar and his wife had clashed several times," Surya said.On October 23, Podar's wife, out of anger, asked her husband to kill the girl. While she stayed outside the house to keep a watch on passersby, Podar went inside the room and while the girl was asleep, he hit her head with an iron rod kept in the room. When she started bleeding, he wrapped her in a blanket till she died. Then he stuffed her body in the box of the bed and called his wife inside. Both of them then washed the room and the iron rod, the officer said.They planned to dispose off the body and waited for a whole day looking for an opportunity but failed to do so. Then to mislead everyone, his wife told Podar to leave Delhi and go to the village so that they can come out clean when the body is detected in the house after a few days as the neighbours would think that Podar was outstation and his wife being handicapped will be treated sympathetically and she would cook up a story to cover up, the officer added.The iron rod used in the commission of crime has been recovered, police said. Both the accused are lepers. While Podar is a rickshaw puller, his wife is a beggar. Both of them also get Rs 5,500 as pension from the government, they said.

03-11-2020||United Nations||Pak taking advantage of coronavirus pandemic to enhance cross-border terrorism: India||Strongly hitting out at Pakistan, India has said it is taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic to enhance support to cross-border terrorism and has resorted to “unbridled hate speech" to try and create divisions among India's religious communities.Addressing an interactive dialogue with Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, First Secretary in India's Permanent Mission to the UN Ashish Sharma on Monday said the hate speech by Pakistan is not merely directed towards one community in India but also against organisations, individuals and even against high ranking political leaders.“While the world has come to a standstill due to the pandemic, Pakistan has only enhanced support to cross-border terrorism taking advantage of the pandemic,” he said.Pakistan has resorted to “unbridled hate speech trying to foment violence and intolerance in our country," he told the UN forum. India strongly hit out at Pakistan for abusing the UN platform to forward its “nefarious political agenda.”         Sharma said that Pakistan is trying to “create divisions among our religious communities as well. Fortunately, their provocation is falling on deaf ears since India has had a tradition of pluralism and co-existence where all communities live in harmony under a democratic framework.India called on Pakistan to practice co-existence in their own country and eschew all sectarian violence, discrimination and intolerance against their own people.Sharma said the world today is confronted not only by the challenge of tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, but also the challenge of “infodemic”, which in many cases has been responsible for rise in hate speech and seeding hatred within communities.In June, India along with 12 countries co-sponsored the Cross-Regional Statement on “Infodemic” in the Context of COVID-19 - a first of its kind statement by UN Member States to counter the increase in hate speech and misinformation during the pandemic.“India is fighting COVID 19 pandemic in the most transparent manner with equal access to medical facilities to all citizens,” Sharma said at the Third Committee meeting of the General Assembly, adding that special efforts have been taken to ensure that vulnerable communities are provided adequate medical support.

03-11-2020||Mumbai||Complaint against Sushant's sisters revealed offence, police tell Bombay High Court||Mumbai police has told the Bombay High Court that they were duty-bound to register an FIR against late actor Sushant Singh Rajput's sisters as the complaint lodged against them by actress Rhea Chakraborty "disclosed commission of offence".The city police on Monday filed an affidavit in the HC seeking dismissal of the petition filed by Rajput's sisters - Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh - to quash the FIR lodged against them for alleged forgery and fabrication of a medical prescription for their brother.The case was lodged against them by Bandra police here in September after receiving a complaint from Rajput's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty.The affidavit filed by Bandra police's senior inspector Nikhil Kapse refuted the allegations that the police were damaging the reputation of the petitioners or any deceased person.By registering the FIR against Rajput's sisters, the police were not trying to "influence or derail" the probe being carried out by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the affidavit said."The FIR (against Priyanka and Meetu) was registered based on the information provided by the first informant (Chakraborty) disclosing commission of offence," it said.The affidavit also claimed that as per the complainant (Chakraborty), a fake and fabricated medical prescription was sent by the petitioners with the help of a Delhi-based doctor wherein medicines for anxiety were prescribed to Rajput.This may have led to the administration of psychotropic substances without actual examination of Rajput by the doctor and may have caused and contributed in his suicidal death, the police said in the affidavit."This version of the informant disclosed cognisable offences warranting investigation and requiring no preliminary enquiry. Therefore, the Mumbai police were duty-bound to register the FIR," the affidavit said.After registration of the FIR, the police in keeping with the order passed by the Supreme Court referred all relevant documents pertaining to the FIR to the CBI which is probing Rajput's death case, it said.The police opposed the stand taken by the CBI that they should not have registered the FIR in the same case that the central agency was already probing."The case being probed by the CBI is one registered by the deceased's father in Bihar."On the other hand, the FIR lodged by the Mumbai police is by Rhea Chakraborty seeking investigation for forgery, cheating and criminal conspiracy against Sushant Singh Rajput's sisters Priyanka and Meetu and doctor Tarun Kumar," the affidavit said.It is now for the CBI to investigate both the FIRs and to file appropriate reports, it said.A bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik will take up the plea for hearing on Wednesday.Rajput, 34, was found hanging at his residence in suburban Bandra on June 14 this year.

03-11-2020||NEW DELHI||Immense scope for India-Germany synergy: Shringla||India has sought to position itself as a reliable partner for Germany at a time when the Indo-Pacific region has begun to occupy an important place in Berlin’s strategic outlook.In his interaction with think-tanks in Germany in the last leg of his three-nation European tour, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla pointed out that German companies could find in India everything that they were looking for.India is one of the fastest growing economies, the fourth largest start-up ecosystem with 21 unicorns, and a large and growing market. Its rapidly growing digital sector has one of the largest data ecosystems in the world and has a major focus on adopting the principles of Industry 4.0, AI, etc. These are all high on the priority list for the German industry and provide immense scope for collaboration, suggested the Foreign Secretary.Germany has invested heavily in China which was reflected in frequent visits to Beijing by its Chancellor Angela Merkel. Shringla argued that the pandemic had given the space for realignment to countries and regions, which would emerge as the prime-movers of the global growth engine and would shape the global governance architecture of the future. In this regard, India could not be left on the periphery of any such analysis.Among measures that the government has taken recently are greater liberalisation for MSMEs and enhancing their ability to access finance and to grow. Germany’s “Mittelstand” is both a role model and a natural partner for India’s SME sector, he said.In India, he said, key indicators have turned positive. Peak power demand is higher over last year, rail freight is returning to normal levels and e-way bills are 15 per cent higher than last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/immense-scope-for-india-germany-synergy-shringla-165219
03-11-2020||New Delhi||Judges must be educated on gender sensitisation, says AG||Attorney General KK Venugopal on Monday told the Supreme Court that judges needed to be educated on gender sensitisation to ensure that they didn’t trivialise sexual violence against women.“On the face of it, the (MP) High Court judge seems to have got carried away as this order was nothing less than a drama that must be condemned,” Venugopal told a Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar.Accused was told to get ‘Rakhi’ tied by victimThe MP HC had on July 30 granted bail to a molestation accused, saying he should visit the house of the complainant and request her to tie a ‘Rakhi’ to him.Alleging that such an order amounted to trivialisation of sexual offences by courts, the petitioners said the bail condition further victimised the complainant.“Courts must restrict themselves to conditions under Sections 437 and 438 of the CrPC,” the Attorney General told the Bench during a hearing on a PIL filed by nine women lawyers against a Madhya Pradesh High Court order granting bail to a molestation accused on the condition that he would request the victim to tie him a ‘Rakhi’.AG says no to criminal contempt against AP CMAG KK Venugopal on Monday declined consent to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy and his aide Ajeya Kallam, who levelled certain allegations against Justice NV Ramana even as he disapproved of their contumacious conduct.The petitioners wanted the top court to restrain courts across India from imposing such bail conditions against the principle of law.“So far as gender sensitisation is concerned, gender sensitisation and grievance redressal committee is there in the Supreme Court and lectures need to be given to subordinate and High Court judges about gender sensitisation.”‘Expedite hearing in foreign Tablighis case’The SC on Monday asked trial courts to expedite hearing in cases against foreign Tablighi Jamaat members for alleged violation of visa norms. A Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar listed the petitions challenging the blacklisting of foreign members of Tablighi Jamaat for further hearing on November 20.“The suggestion is that the examinations for judges and National Judicial Academy and State Judicial Academies must have programmes on gender sensitisation...This is an opportunity for this court to impart gender sensitisation,” Venugopal submitted.The MP High Court had on July 30 granted bail to a molestation accused and imposed a condition that he along with his wife shall visit the house of the complainant and request her to tie a ‘Rakhi’ to him with the promise to protect her to the best of his ability for all times to come.Alleging that such an order amounted to trivialisation of sexual offences by courts, the petitioners said the bail condition further victimised the complainant and trivialised the trauma that she suffered.The top court posted the matter for further hearing on November 27 when it will consider laying down guidelines for judges in this regard.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/judges-must-be-educated-on-gender-sensitisation-says-ag-165216

The NDA alliance has fielded a fair share of upper caste nominees for the second phase.Sources said the grand alliance was hoping for issues of life and livelihood to trump the caste factor. Records show the NDA has performed better than the others in the 94 seats in the past.

03-11-2020||New Delhi||Brace for harsher, extended winter season, says IMD||With temperatures dropping below normal over many parts of Northwest, bringing a sudden nip in the air, meteorologists are suspecting a “harsher/colder and an extended winter” this season due to various reasons-local/regional apart from prevailing La Nina conditions.Delhi Records lowest Minimum temperatureThe national capital today recorded a minimum temperature of 10.8 degrees Celsius, the lowest this season so far. Normally in the first week of November the Safdarjung Observatory records a minimum of 14 to 16 degrees Celsius. The mercury dips to 11-12 degrees Celsius by the last week of November, according to IMD officials.The IMD says temperatures remained “appreciably below normal (-3.1°C to - 5.0°C) at places over Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan and Muzaffarabad and below normal (-1.6°C to -3.0°C) over West Uttar Pradesh, East Rajasthan, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi in the past 24 hours with Hissar recording the minimum temperature of 8.9 degrees Celsius.As per Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, November 1 was the coldest in the past 10 years in the capital and that similar conditions are also prevailing in adjoining regions. Predicting a “harsher and extended winter this season”, he says there are three main reasons for early drop in temperatures this year — dry weather, lesser/weaker Western Disturbances and clear skies. “There has not been much snowfall in the hills as most of the WDs have been feeble. Around Diwali, a strong WD is expected to bring snow to hills, which will result in a drop in temperatures. Also, this is a La Nina year and La Nina conditions coincide with extended winter,” Palawat said.IMD Director-General Mrityunjaya Mohapatra said: “Generally, during a La Nina year temperatures remain low but a lot depends upon regional factors, winds, etc. The IMD will be issuing a detailed weather forecast for the season later this month.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/brace-for-harsher-extended-winter-season-says-imd-165244
