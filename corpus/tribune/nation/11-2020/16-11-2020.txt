16-11-2020||Hyderabad||Puri confident of air travel reaching pre-COVID levels by year-end or early next year||Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Monday expressed confidence that air travel would reach pre-COVID levels by the end of the year or early next year.“We opened civil aviation on May 25, a good two months and two days after we have completely locked down.....with 30,000 passengers on a day. Two days or three days ago, I think just before Diwali, we carried 225,000 and with a scale at which we are opening up in a calibrated manner, we have already opened up 70 per cent capacity,” he said.He said he has told his colleagues to look at 80 per cent.“I am confident that by the end of the year, by December 31 or soon thereafter... means a week or two weeks thereafter, we will be back to pre-COVID levels,” he said.But, reaching the pre-COVID levels requires that the existing safety protocols are strengthened further, he said.“But, that requires, in turn, that we continue to maintain the existing safety protocols, we strengthen them and we are able to adapt...,” he added.Speaking through video conference at ‘Deccan Dialogue’ organised by the Indian School of Business (ISB) here, Puri said he was committed to bringing aviation GDP back to India.Observing that the value of traffic between India and the United States is roughly USD seven billion annually, he said the Indian carriers get a mere 17 per cent out of that traffic.“How much do Indian carriers get out of that traffic. A mere 17 per cent. It is not as if the American carriers are getting the remaining 83 per cent. I am not going to say who is getting it. But, I see no reason why the Indian flagship carrier or the private sector carrier should not be earning more money flying passengers,” he said.These are distorted business models because something went wrong, he lamented.Civil aviation would get a boost in the next few years with the country getting 100 new airports and the fleet size reaching up to 2,000 from around 750 now, he said.“Our fleet size today should be around 750.I know airlines when they come across a pandemic like this, they try to curtail the size of their fleet orders. But, I can say with seven per cent penetration which means out of every 100, only seven Indians fly and a 17 per cent rate of growth which we experienced pre-COVID at one time. We will move from 750, not to the 1,200 which everybody says, but to 2,000 aircraft. We will do it pretty quickly,” he said.There was a massive opportunity for investors across the aviation ecosystem and aviation is a critical driver of economic growth across airports, airlines, ground- handling and others, he said.Puri, who is also Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs, hoped that the country would be able to reposition itself as an economic player in the global supply chain before long.The minister, who was optimistic about the economic aspects in the country, said there have been massive investments by global technology majors in India even during the unprecedented times of the pandemic.

16-11-2020||New Delhi||Petition seeks review of Shaheen Bagh verdict||More than two months after the Supreme Court ruled that roads and public spaces can’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations had to be in designated places alone, a petition has been filed seeking review of the verdict."Such observations may prove to be a license in the hands of the Police to commit atrocities on legitimate voice of protest, especially the protesters coming from the vulnerable sections of the social strata. Again this aspect is an error of law apparent," the review petition filed by a group of 12 Shaheen Bagh protesters stated.They said the October 7 judgment "appear to be giving way to an unrestricted sanction to the police to take action by misusing these observations."Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the Supreme Court had ruled that roads and public spaces cannot be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.Deciding petitions seeking removal of protesters against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) from Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, a three-judge Bench headed by Justice SK Kaul had said, “We have…no hesitation in concluding that such kind of occupation of public ways, whether at the site in question or anywhere else for protests is not acceptable and the administration ought to take action to keep the areas clear of encroachments or obstructions”.Notified on January 10, the CAA relaxed norms for grant of Indian citizenship by naturalization to Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist and Jain and Parsi victims of religious persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who came to India before December 31, 2014. The top court had on January 22 refused to stay the operation of CAA and NPR. Though the protesters blocking the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, including the Okhla underpass since December 15, 2019, were removed on March 24 this year after COVID-19 lockdown was enforced, the top court had chosen to keep the matter pending to clarify the legal position on the issue.The court had also faulted the authorities for not taking any decision, saying: “Unfortunately, despite a lapse of a considerable period of time, there was neither any negotiations nor any action by the administration, thus warranting our intervention”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/petition-seeks-review-of-shaheen-bagh-verdict-171194
16-11-2020||New Delhi||Kapil Sibal’s comments have hurt sentiments of Congress workers across country: Ashok Gehlot||Congress leader Kapil Sibal’s comments to the media criticising the leadership after the Bihar elections defeat has “hurt the sentiments” of party workers across the country, senior leader and Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said on Monday.With a few leaders echoing the views expressed by Sibal, Gehlot said in a series of tweets, “There was no need for Mr Kapil Sibal to mentioned (sic) our internal issue in Media, this has hurt the sentiments of party workers across the country.”“Congress has seen various crises including (in) 1969, 1977, 1989 and later in the 1996, but every-time we came out stronger due to our ideology, programs, policies and firm belief in party leadership. We have improved with each and every crisis and also formed UPA government in 2004 under the able leadership of Soniaji, we shall overcome this time too,” the chief minister said.There was no need for Mr Kapil Sibal to mentioned our internal issue in Media, this has hurt the sentiments of party workers across the country. 1/  Sibal, a former Union minister, tagged his media interview and tweeted, “We are yet to hear on recent polls... Maybe Congress leadership thinks it should be business as usual.”           The Congress won 19 out of the 70 seats it contested in Bihar as part of the RJD-led grand alliance. The opposition alliance ended up with 110 seats, while the NDA retained power bagging 125 seats in the 243-member assembly.Sibal was part of a group of 23 senior Congress leaders who had in August written to party chief Sonia Gandhi making suggestions on ways to revive the organisation.Countering Sibal, Gehlot said, “There are various reasons for electoral loses. But each time rank and file of the Congress Party has shown undivided and firm belief in the party leadership and that is why we came out of it stronger and united after every crises. Even today, Congress is the only party which can keep this Nation united and take it forward on the path of comprehensive development.”Backing Sibal, Congress Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha said it is time to act now, else it will be too late. He also said that for democracy to survive, the Congress has to survive. Tankha was also a part of the 23 leaders who had sought overhaul in the party.“Kapil ji is an iconic lawyer and hard core congress personality. Together and individually we have fought countless battles and continue to fight ag BJP shenanigans. For our democracy to survive Congress has to survive. Time to act is now or tomorrow may be too late,” Tankha tweeted while tagging Sibal’s interview.After the party’s poor show in Bihar polls, Karti Chidambaram also pitched for introspection and asked for an internal discussion on the losses.Karti, son of former Union minister P Chidambaram, in a tweet said: “It’s time we introspect, ideate, consult & act @INCIndia.”        The Lok Sabha MP from Sivaganga in Tamil Nadu made the cryptic comment while tagging a tweet by Sibal on his interview.Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam demanded that party leaders who were responsible for taking decisions in Bihar polls should be held accountable for the dismal show, but defended Rahul Gandhi.Rahul Gandhi only went to campaign for the party but was not responsible for the decisions taken in Bihar, Nirupam added.

Hemla was involved in incidents of loot of explosives and ration from Bailadila iron ore mines in the past,” he added.Hemla was given assistance of Rs 10,000 while other facilities under the government’s surrender and rehabilitation policy will be provided soon, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/naxal-with-rs-3-lakh-reward-on-his-head-surrenders-in-chhattisgarh-171191
16-11-2020||New Delhi||US Navy’s Nimitz strike group to be part of 2nd phase of Malabar exercise beginning Tuesday||The Indian Navy’s Vikramaditya carrier battle group, the Nimitz strike group of the US Navy and several frontline warships from the Australian and Japanese navies will carry out a four-day high-intensity war game in the Northern Arabian Sea from Tuesday as part of the second phase of the Malabar exercise.This exercise will involve coordinated operations of increasing complexity among the navies of the four countries which are part of the Quad or Quadrilateral Coalition, officials said.The first phase of the Malabar exercise took place in the Bay of Bengal from November 3 to 6 and featured a number of complex drills including anti-submarine and anti-air warfare operations.The mega exercise is taking place at a time India and China are locked in an over six-month-long bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh that has majorly strained the ties between the two countries.“The second phase of exercise Malabar will be conducted in the Northern Arabian Sea from November 17 to 20,” the Navy said in a statement, adding it will witness operations centered around the Vikramaditya carrier battle group and Nimitz carrier strike group.It said the exercise “highlights enhanced convergence of views amongst the four vibrant democracies on maritime issues, and showcases their commitment to an open, inclusive Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order”.The participation of the US strike group led by the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the exercise will significantly enhance its overall impact, said an official on the condition of anonymity.The USS Nimitz is the world’s largest warship. A carrier battle group or carrier strike group is a mega naval fleet comprising an aircraft carrier, accompanied by a large number of destroyers, frigates and other ships.In the exercise, the Nimitz will be accompanied by cruiser Princeton and destroyer Sterett in addition to P8A maritime reconnaissance aircraft. The Royal Australian Navy will be represented by frigate Ballarat along with its integral helicopter.“The two carriers, along with other ships, submarines and aircraft of the participating navies, would be engaged in high-intensity naval operations over four days,” the Indian Navy said.It said the exercise will include cross-deck flying operations and advanced air defence exercises by MIG 29K fighters of Vikramaditya and F-18 fighters and E2C Hawkeye from Nimitz.“In addition, advanced surface and anti-submarine warfare exercises, seamanship evolutions and weapon firings will also be undertaken to further enhance interoperability and synergy between the four friendly navies,” it said.Apart from Vikramaditya and its fighter and helicopter air-wings, the Indian Navy will also deploy destroyers Kolkata and Chennai, stealth frigate Talwar and fleet support ship Deepak in the exercise.The Indian contingent will be led by Rear Admiral Krishna Swaminathan, Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet.Indigenously built submarine Khanderi and P8I maritime reconnaissance aircraft of the Indian Navy will also showcase their capabilities during the exercise.Last month, India announced that Australia will be part of the Malabar exercise which effectively made it a drill by all four member nations of the Quad which is primarily focusing on containing China’s military expansionism in the Indo-Pacific region.China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise as it feels that the annual war game is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region.The invitation by India to the Australian Navy for the exercise came two weeks after foreign ministers of the ‘Quad’ member nations held extensive talks in Tokyo with a focus on enhancing their cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent member of the exercise in 2015. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-navys-nimitz-strike-group-to-be-part-of-2nd-phase-of-malabar-exercise-beginning-tuesday-171182

16-11-2020||New Delhi||Harassment, humiliation: Artistes cry foul as govt asks to vacate accommodation||Leading artistes who have been asked to vacate their government allotted residences, including Padma Shri awardee Bharati Shivaji, on Monday said they were feeling “harassed”, “humiliated” and “pained” by the government’s treatment.In October this year, 27 eminent personalities, including artists, dancers and musicians were sent notices from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, to vacate their government allotted accommodations across Delhi by December 31, “failing which eviction proceeding will be initiated as per Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act”.Other major artistes who have been sent these notices are Jatin Das, Pt Bhajan Sopori, Pt Birju Maharaj, Rita Ganguly, and Ustad F Wasifuddin Dagar.Mohiniyattam dancer Bharati Shivaji said she was in “a state of shock” and yet to determine her “plan of action”.“This is harassment. I don’t have a separate land or institute, and I have been doing all creative activity from my home. But it seems the powers that may be have no value for the traditional art forms,” Shivaji, who has an accommodation in Asian Village, said.She said the least any government can do is to provide accommodation to artistes who have worked and toiled hard for preserving the traditional art. Many of them objected to the use of the term “unauthorised” to define their current state of residence.Kuchipudi dancer Vanashree Rao, wife of Kuchipudi dancer Guru Jayarama Rao, in whose name their accommodation was allotted, said the term seemed to imply they were occupying the space “illegally”.She explained that following the first three years of allotment, they were given extensions till 2014 after which they were paying rent for the premises as directed by the government.“In 2018, the government sent us a retrospective rent amount of some Rs 8-9 lakh for the last four years. We have also been paying that, sometimes Rs 60,000, and sometimes Rs 1 lakh, because having so much money at one time is also not possible for us.“Despite doing everything we’re being treated like squatters. We are not squatters,” she said.Noted Indian dance historian Sunil Kothari shared Rao’s sentiments.“I am a Padma Shri and Sangeet Natak Akademi awardee. I have written several books on Indian classical dance forms and allied art forms and have been part of many committees, and this is what my government gives me in return.“I feel humiliated that at the age of 88 I have been sent, what I call, a ‘get out’ notice, and asked to leave the place which has been home to me for the past 20 years,” he said.Das said he felt “ashamed” to have been treated like “a criminal”.“I feel so ashamed to think that after 16 years of putting everything into my work and my country, I might be on the streets if I am unable to vacate my house.“I have been on so many advisory boards of so many cultural committees for the government, and all of them have been honorary positions. I never got paid. If I had a house in Delhi, do they think I would still be living here,” the painter, whose Pankha collection is world renowned, asked.Explaining why they don’t have their own house in the city, Das, Shivaji and Rao said the money they earn goes back towards creating more art.“I am not a commercial artist. I am not in the business of art. Whatever I earn from my painting, I use it to buy supplies for my next painting,” Das, who will turn 80 next month, said.Shivaji said whatever they earn from performances has to be shared with musicians who accompany them and they have little left over.Another major grievance shared by all artistes was the poor timing of the notice.They said the fact that they are all above 65 years of age and have been asked to uproot their lives without a ready alternative to relocate to, while there is a pandemic, is unfair.“Throughout the pandemic, the prime minister has insisted that landlords across the country should not evict their tenants, and even reduce the rent, and they are doing this to us,”” Rao said.To draw attention to the “insensitivity” of the order, the artistes have also written to the prime minister and the president of the country.The letters dated October 14 requested them to “look into the matter” and “support the arts community”.“We are concerned about our future security and professional work if we are not given permission to continue.“Many times the government and our country refer to us as legends, and cultural ambassadors, so we feel that our government, especially the Culture Ministry should recommend our extension immediately,” the letters read.Similar letters were also sent to the culture minister, the culture secretary and other officials but “no one got back”.“The Culture Minister does not even want to meet us... I have been paying my rent, which from 2014 has been Rs 15,000 per month. I am not married, I live alone but I have thousands of books, where should I go? If they want this space, they should at least provide us with a separate accommodation,” Kothari said.When asked about the government’s next course of action, Culture Minister Prahlad Singh Patel said they had done “whatever was possible for these artistes from our end”.“We requested the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs to waive the dues accumulated by the artistes. But they have to vacate the premises by December 31, if they fail to do so they will have to pay rent according to market rates. We have done whatever was possible from our end,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/harassment-humiliation-artistes-cry-foul-as-govt-asks-to-vacate-accommodation-171179

We now not only provide for ourselves but deliver to the world,” he said in his inaugural address."As the demand for medicines, especially hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol, spiked we stepped up production and supplied to 150 countries — more than half of it was on our own cost,” he said.“Today the focus has shifted to rapid testing and reliable vaccines — both essential for the return to normalcy — and we are at the heart of international and multilateral collaborations.“Prime Minister Modi has committed to the United Nations that we will help make vaccines accessible and affordable to all. And believe me, from the regular conversations that I've had with so many counterparts, the world is counting on us," he said.Delivering the inaugural keynote address, Jaishankar said: “Choices today have deeper strategic implications and, in this context, Atmanirbhar Bharat is critical perspective for India.”“We must build capabilities to effectively realise the fruits of globalisation and the current openness is not giving the full picture.“The Indian diaspora play an important role in connecting the world and today’s India will not lead any Indian abroad into distress. The pandemic has shown extraordinary social discipline and explore its inherent capabilities,” said the minister. Taking the discourse a step further, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said Atmanirbhar Bharat was not an inward-looking trade policy but a thought after strategy that would enable and lead us towards a stronger self-reliant India. Technology, he said, would play an important role in Atmanirbhar Bharat, and COVID-19 came when technology was receiving quantum boost.We are now amplifying the use of technology due to COVID-19, said Puri.Talking about the Aviation sector, he emphasised that there were massive opportunities for investment in the aviation sector and we would soon be able to reposition our self as global economic player with natural advantages in multiple sectors.Ambassador Rahul Chhabra, Secretary, Economic Relations, Ministry of External Affairs, said: “No body is safe until all of us are safe. Health security was not a main table agenda in international discussions but post the pandemic it has become the top agenda.”“India supplied critical medicines to the world at the need of the hour, half of it in a non-commercial basis,” said Chhabra.Member, Executive Board, ISB, and Chairman, Hero Enterprise, Sunil Kant Munjal, said: “ISB, over the years, could institutionalise and create research driven institutions within the school focusing on infrastructure, manufacturing, healthcare and public policy. ISB will be delighted to create a separate centre of excellence on ‘business and diplomacy’ in partnership with the MEA.” Professor Rajendra Srivastava, Dean, Indian School of Business, said: “India has the capacity to become the caregiver of the world. Human capital with technology and collaboration with diaspora are important elements to successful globalisation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-take-lead-in-providing-vaccine-to-the-world-s-jaishankar-171176

The entities are required to obtain security clearance for all foreign personnel likely to be deployed for over 60 days in a year by way of appointment, contract or consultancy or any other capacity for functioning of the entity, prior to their deployment.“For this purpose, the entities will apply to the ministry at least 60 days in advance and the proposed foreign personnel shall be deployed by the entity only after prior approval of this ministry,” the public notice said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-seeks-compliance-of-26-per-cent-fdi-in-digital-news-within-1-month-171174
16-11-2020||Satya Prakash||SC refuses to debar tainted politicians from contesting polls||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 16The Supreme Court on Monday refused to debar tainted politicians from contesting polls, saying it was for Parliament to take a call on such issues.A Bench headed by Justice LN Rao also refused to declare as null and void the elections of MLAs and MPs charge-sheeted for over a year for offences punishable with a minimum five-year imprisonment.“We agree that what you are saying is correct. But we cannot pass such orders. This is under the domain of the Parliament,” the Bench told SN Shukla, a retired civil servant, who represented petitioner Lok Prahari.The petitioner NGO wanted the top court to debar politicians against whom charges have been framed to be disqualified from contesting polls. It would amount to virtually amending the Representation of People Act, 1951, the top court noted.On behalf of the NGO, its office-bearer Shukla submitted that such a law will never be passed by Parliament. Criminals were getting into the legislatures and they had already crossed the 33% mark.“We are afraid the relief claimed in this plea cannot be granted by this court. However, we leave it open to the petitioner to pursue any remedy available to have the directions issued by this court implemented,” the top court said disposing of the petition.The top court’s Monday’s order is in tune with its 2018 Constitution Bench verdict on the issue.Displaying judicial restraint, the top court had refrained from debarring politicians facing serious criminal charges from contesting polls and instead left it to Parliament to enact a law to rid Indian politics of criminals.“In a multi-party democracy, where members are elected on party lines and are subject to party discipline, we recommend to Parliament to bring out a strong law whereby it is mandatory for the political parties to revoke membership of persons against whom charges are framed in heinous and grievous offences and not to set up such persons in elections, both for the Parliament and the State Assemblies,” it had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-debar-tainted-politicians-from-contesting-polls-171172
16-11-2020||Jaipur||Two killed, 9 injured in clashes in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur district||Two people died and nine others were injured during a clash between two groups in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur district on Monday, police said.The deceased have been identified as 34-year-old Rohitash Jatav and 60-year-old Asharfi Devi, they said.Jatav was shot dead during the violence, police said, adding that the cause of death of Devi is yet to be ascertained.The clash broke out between groups led by Asu Mev and Kundan Jatav, they said. Police said that the reason seems to be old enmity over a matter related to a panchayat election held in the past. “Members of both groups clashed with each other and opened fire, which left Rohitash Jatav of one group dead. Asharfi Devi from the other group also died in the clash,” Circle Officer Kaman Pradeep Singh said.He added that nine others were injured in the incident. Multiple FIRs related to different matters have been registered by members of both the groups against each in the last 2-3 years on different matters, police said. The officer said that additional police force has been deployed in the village to maintain peace and law and order. He informed that no one has been arrested so far.

I hope he makes his priority positive issues such as aspirations of the people of Bihar, the NDAs promise of 19 lakh jobs-employment, education, health, livelihood, irrigation and justice rather than his ambition for the chair,” Tejashwi wrote in a social media post.Kumar’s JD(U) had clinched just 43 seats, 31 less that its ally the BJP. RJD had won 75 seats to emerge as the party to have won the largest number of seats of the 243 member assembly.RJD and four other Mahagathbandhan constituents, boycotted Nitish Kumar’s swearing-in ceremony alleging that the mandate in the Bihar polls was against the NDA and was changed through fraud.LJP president Chirag Paswan too took a dig at Kumar as he congratulated him on being administered the oath of office.Paswan’s Lok Janshakti Party had walked out of the NDA in Bihar vowing to oust Nitish Kumar from power in the state, also congratulated  BJP on “making” him the chief minister.“Congratulations to Nitish Kumar Ji on becoming chief minister again. I hope the government completes its term and you continue to remain the chief minister of NDA only,” Paswan tweeted after Kumar was administered the oath of office. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tejashwi-wishes-nitish-kumar-on-being-nominated-bihar-cm-171170
16-11-2020||New Delhi||Over 2,700 childcare homes lack measures to prevent child abuse: Govt report||As many as 2,764 childcare institutions across the country, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of such homes, do not have adequate measures to prevent any form of physical, emotional abuse of children that results in trauma, according to government’s social audit report.The social audit of all childcare homes across the country was ordered in 2018 when cases of sexual exploitation of girls were reported from childcare institutions in Deoria in Uttar Pradesh and Muzaffarpur in Bihar.The social audit was carried out in 7,163 childcare institutions, which house 2.56 lakh children across the country. It found that 2,764 institutions, accounting for 39 per cent of these homes, do not have adequate measures to prevent any form of physical, emotional abuse of children that results in mental or physical trauma.Among states, 93.8 per cent in Andaman and Nicobar, 86.8 per cent in Tripura and 74.2 per cent of the childcare institutions in Karnataka do not have adequate measures to prevent any form of abuse of children, the report said.An official with the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) said a lack of these measures can act as a trigger for physical and emotional abuse of children at childcare homes.The report also found that 1,504 of the homes lack exclusive toilet facilities, while 434 do not have privacy in toilets and bathing areas.The report also found that 373 such homes lack provision for individual, clean, seasonal and age appropriate clothes, articles and toiletries, and 1,069 homes do not have individual beds for these children.According to the report, 2,039 CCIs constituting 28.5 per cent of such homes are still not registered.Among the states, about 88 per cent of the child care institutions in Maharashtra have not been registered, followed by 51 per cent in Himachal Pradesh and 46 per cent in Delhi, the report showed.The report also found that managing committees that take decisions on functioning of the childcare homes were constituted in 90 per cent of the homes but regular meetings were not held in 85 per cent of them.“If these meetings are not conducted then it means that no one has accountability of the home. About 23 per cent of the homes did not have a cook so who prepares the food? About 48 per cent of the homes did not have counsellors,” an NCPCR official told PTI.He said 29 per cent of the childcare homes have staff who do not have training on the rehabilitation process of children. About 70 per cent of the homes have not given training to its staff in child rights protection, while 61 per cent did not impart training on caregiving of these children.The official said once the social audit reports were ready, they were examined by the commission and various shortcomings/discrepancies were found in all the 7,164 CCIs that were audited.“Considering the seriousness of the issue and in the best interest of the children to ensure their safety and security, the commission took cognizance and the shortcomings and discrepancies highlighted in the CCI report were communicated to district magistrates/district collectors for immediate actions. These shortcomings were also brought to the notice of the Principal Secretary, Department of Women and Child Development of States,” he said.He said a serious case was observed at a childcare home in Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh which was established to mitigate the hardships caused to the children post-partition activities.“We found certain violations in the upkeep of the said CCI. As the commission was itself surprised over such a large number of infirmities, it decided to have first-hand information about the home before submitting its report to the court and therefore, visited the home and found the facts mentioned in the report to be true,” he said.“The physical condition of the home was so pathetic that it was difficult to believe. Bathrooms of the CCI (meant for girls) did not have doors and general upkeep of the CCI was far from satisfactory. Children were living there without CWC order. The district magistrate concerned was asked to explain the pathetic state of affairs of the children home,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-2-700-childcare-homes-lack-measures-to-prevent-child-abuse-govt-report-171169

If some ordinary person makes any comment against the government, cases are promptly registered against such persons.“When persons in positions made comments against the judges and the courts, why have cases not been filed? Looking at things, we are left to infer that a war has been declared on the judiciary,” the bench commented orally during a hearing. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-books-16-for-defamatory-content-against-sc-andhra-hc-judges-on-social-media-171165

With a tired and politically belittled leader as CM, #Bihar should brace for few more years of lacklustre governance,” Kishor said in a tweet.The tweet was his first in nearly four months as he used to be very active on the microblogging website. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kumar-bjp-nominated-cm-tired-and-politically-belittled-prashant-kishor-171161
16-11-2020||---||SC refuses to interfere with Army couple’s separate postings||New Delhi, November 16The Supreme Court on Monday refused to interfere with separate postings of an Army couple, saying somebody has to go and serve in places like Ladakh, North-East and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.The petitioner – a Colonel in the Judge Advocate General (JAG) Department, was aggrieved by his posting to Andaman and Nicobar Islands from Jodhpur in Rajasthan as his wife was being sent to Bathinda in Punjab.He had challenged the decision to transfer him and his wife to separate far off locations but the Delhi High Court rejected his plea and asked him and his wife – also a Colonel in the Army – to proceed to their newly assigned posts within 15 days.Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the petitioner, said that both the officers had a four-and-half-year-old child and they had taken charge at their respective places. The distance between Bhatinda and Andaman and Nicobar Islands is over 3,500 km, he said, adding, the petitioner had to apply for voluntary retirement because of the transfer.“If the Armed forces say they are opposed to joint posting in Delhi, it may be harsh but somebody has to go to Andaman and Nicobar also,” the top court noted.“In matters of posting of Army officers, we should not interfere. In places like Ladakh, North-East and Andaman, somebody has to go,” the Bench observed.“In postings, particularly in the Armed forces, we should not interfere. These are very hard cases. It is very difficult for us to say that reconsider this,” the Bench said, forcing Kumar to withdraw the plea.The Army contended that since the couple's marriage in 2008, they had been given three spouse coordinated postings on their requests and "all-out efforts were made to post both of them in the same station".Posting the couple at New Delhi "will be at the cost of maintaining voids at formation HQs, which is not in organisational interest”, it submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-interfere-with-army-couples-separate-postings-171160

16-11-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 impact: Winter, Budget sessions of Parliament may be clubbed||In the wake of rising COVID-19 cases in the national capital, it is being contemplated that a single extended session of parliament be held instead of separate winter and budget sessions, sources said on Monday.However, nothing has been finalised and discussions are still in a preliminary stage. A final call is yet to be taken, but there are suggestions that a single unified session can be held in the place of two sessions in such a short span of period, the sources said.The winter session of parliament usually starts from the last week of November or the first week of December, while the budget session starts from the last week of January and the Union Budget is tabled on February 1.The monsoon session, which was held from September 14 in midst of the pandemic, was cut short by eight days and concluded on September 24 as, despite the elaborate arrangements made by authorities, many MPs and Parliament staff members tested positive for COVID-19.Several first-time measures such as staggered sitting of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and the use of both chambers and galleries to accommodate members while following physical distancing norms were implemented during the monsoon session.The Budget session was also curtailed earlier this year amid the looming threat of the COVID-19 pandemic.Former Lok Sabha Secretary General PDT Acharya said it is a convention to hold three sessions of parliament in a year. It is not a rule.As per the Constitution, there should not be a gap of six months or more between two sessions.If government clubs two sessions of parliament and holds only two sessions this year, then it will not be a violation of any rule, Acharya said.The national capital had recorded its highest single-day spike of 8,593 COVID-19 cases on Wednesday.On Thursday, 104 fatalities, the highest in a day in over five months, were recorded.The rise in cases prompted the Centre to announce fresh steps on Sunday including a house-to-house survey. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-impact-winter-budget-sessions-of-parliament-may-be-clubbed-171149

16-11-2020||New Delhi||Voices of discontent re-emerge within Cong after dismal Bihar show||Days after the Congress suffered another electoral setback in Bihar, voices of discontent within the party resurfaced with a section of leaders calling for action and introspection.Calls for reform and accountability for the Bihar polls debacle, however, invited quick rebuttals from the party which fielded veteran leader Ashok Gehlot to say that the Congress has always sprung back from crisis.Gehlot’s assertions followed former minister Kapil Sibal’s public criticism of the Congress leadership and his remarks that the time of introspection was over and people no longer saw the party as an effective alternative.Sibal’s open call for reform in the Congress comes close on the heels of 23 party leaders writing to party president Sonia Gandhi for leadership change and organisational overhaul. Sibal himself was part of the group of 23 leaders.Gehlot came out in strong defence of the Congress and Sonia Gandhi, saying the Congress is still the only party that can keep the nation united.Ticking off Sibal for going public over the party’s internal issues, Gehlot said, “There was no need for Mr Kapil Sibal to mention our internal issue in Media, this has hurt the sentiments of party workers across the country.”“Congress has seen various crises, including (in) 1969, 1977, 1989 and later in the 1996, but every-time we came out stronger due to our ideology, programs, policies and firm belief in party leadership. We have improved with each and every crisis and also formed UPA government in 2004 under the able leadership of Soniaji, we shall overcome this time too,” the chief minister said.Sibal, a former union minister, tagged his media interview and tweeted, “We are yet to hear on recent polls... Maybe Congress leadership thinks it should be business as usual.”The Congress won 19 out of the 70 seats it contested in Bihar as part of the RJD-led grand alliance. The opposition alliance ended up with 110 seats, while the NDA retained power bagging 125 seats in the 243-member assembly.Countering Sibal, Gehlot said, “There are various reasons for electoral loses. But each time rank and file of the Congress Party has shown undivided and firm belief in the party leadership and that is why we came out of it stronger and united after every crises. Even today, Congress is the only party which can keep this Nation united and take it forward on the path of comprehensive development.”       Backing Sibal, Congress Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha said it is time to act now, else it will be too late. He also said that for democracy to survive, the Congress has to survive. Tankha was also a part of the 23 leaders who had sought overhaul in the party.“Kapil ji is an iconic lawyer and hard core congress personality. Together and individually we have fought countless battles and continue to fight ag BJP shenanigans. For our democracy to survive Congress has to survive. Time to act is now or tomorrow may be too late,” Tankha tweeted while tagging Sibal’s interview.After the party’s poor show in Bihar polls, Karti Chidambaram also pitched for introspection and asked for an internal discussion on the losses.Tagging a tweet by Sibal on his interview, Karti, son of former union minister P Chidambaram, said: “It’s time we introspect, ideate, consult and act.”Earlier, RJD leader Sivanand Tiwari also raised questions on the Congress, saying the party had “shackled” the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ and its performance is helping the BJP.“Congress shackled the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ with chains in the assembly elections. It contested 70 seats but did not hold even 70 rallies. Rahul Gandhi visited Bihar on three days and addressed two rallies a day. Priyanka Gandhi was not seen at all. When electioneering was at its peak, he was picnicking with Priyanka Gandhi in Shimla,” Tiwari said.The Congress reacted sharply to Tiwari’s criticism with its in-charge in Bihar Shaktisinh Gohil saying, “Mr Tiwari wants to weaken the grand alliance and save the fragile NDA government in Bihar. RJD leadership should take note of this betrayer, otherwise damage would be done to those parties which are united ideologically and the people of Bihar. Shivanand Tiwari has switched sides again and again and was a JDU MP. It is unsurprising that his loyalty still seems to be with JDU.”Congress national general secretary Tariq Anwar, who had called for “deep introspection” following the party’s abysmal performance in the Bihar polls, defended Rahul Gandhi, saying the leader of a national party cannot be expected to devote time and energy to a state poll like the leader of a regional outfit.“First of all, Shivanand Tiwari is not an authorised spokesperson for the RJD. Also, he should realise that Congress is a national party while the RJD is a regional entity. The leader of a national party cannot be expected to devote time to a state election like a regional leader would,” he said.Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam has also demanded that party leaders who were responsible for taking decisions in Bihar polls should be held accountable for the dismal show, but defended Rahul Gandhi.Rahul Gandhi only went to campaign for the party but was not responsible for the decisions taken in Bihar, Nirupam added.Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi in a tweet took a veiled dig at Narendra Modi over reports that there has been a 230 per cent increase in the wealth of industrialist Gautam Adani after he became prime minister. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/voices-of-discontent-re-emerge-within-cong-after-dismal-bihar-show-171146
16-11-2020||Patna||Nitish Kumar: Masterful craftsman of realpolitik who believes politics is the art of possible||"Politics is the art of the possible", German statesman Otto Von Bismarck once famously said.And who understands it better than Nitish Kumar, the modern-day craftsman of realpolitik, who has survived many a headwind to secure a fourth straight term as the Bihar Chief Minister despite his party finishing a poor third in the 243-member state Assembly.Nitish Kumar's unusual knack for spotting friends has got him where it has despite the drastic slump in the electoral fortune of his party that won just 43 seats, down from 71 it had in 2015, and 31 less than ally BJP which clinched 74.The most atypical of politicians owing their rise to post-Mandal politics, Nitish Kumar stood out for his ability to address the governance deficit, unlike a majority of the breed reared in the socialist stable, but was often accused of pursuing politics of opportunism.Call it political opportunism or sagacity, his moves, in effect, prevented the Hindutva forces from holding sway over Bihar, where a section of the BJP feels mortified over not having its own Chief Minister till date despite enjoying a near hegemonic status nationally.Known for weighing his options carefully before making any move, Kumar, upon a closer look, comes across as a risk taker who has not shied away from going against the tide.An engineer by training who had taken an active part in the JP movement, Kumar spurned a job offer from the state Electricity Department and decided to take the political gamble, an oddity among educated youth in Bihar for whom the lure of "sarkaari naukri" remains undiminished.Unlike Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan, his co- travellers during the movement led by Jayaprakash Narayan, electoral success eluded Kumar for long.He got the first taste of victory, after three successive defeats, in the 1985 Assembly polls when he won from Harnaut as a candidate of the Lok Dal though the Congress swept the elections riding the tailwind generated by the assassination of Indira Gandhi the previous year.Four years later, Nitish entered the Lok Sabha from Barh even as fellow MP from Saran Lalu Prasad shifted to Bihar, taking over as the Chief Minister and scripting a spectacular success story which altered the state's political landscape.Kumar, one of the most articulate leaders of the Janata Dal, had fully backed Lalu in the keenly fought internal contest for Chief Ministership.The next decade-and-a-half saw Prasad's rise as one of the most powerful but controversial figures of his time who ruled the state by proxy, getting his demure homemaker wife Rabri Devi elected as his successor, when a chargesheet in fodder scam caused him to step down as the CM.During the same period, Kumar burnt his bridges with Lalu Prasad, floated the Samata Party, and built his own political edifice brick by brick.The Samata Party joined forces with the BJP and Kumar made a mark for himself as an outstanding parliamentarian and was reckoned among the competent ministers in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet.After a rift between Sharad Yadav, the then Janata Dal president, and Lalu Prasad, the latter broke away and formed the RJD. The Samata Party merged with Sharad Yadav's Janata Dal while continuing its alliance with the BJP.After the NDA lost power in 2004, a victory in Bihar held out the promise of a degree of redemption for the BJP-led alliance.Attempts to wrest power from the RJD-Congress combine, then in power at the Centre as well, after the NDA fell short of majority in the Assembly polls of February, 2005, were stymied by Governor Buta Singh's controversial move to dissolve the Assembly, without it having even been constituted, in the face of alleged horse trading.This, however, proved a blessing in disguise for Kumar who was projected as the Chief Ministerial candidate in the elections that took place nine months later and the JD(U)-BJP combine got a comfortable majority, bringing the so-called "Lalu era" to an end.Kumar's first five years as Chief Minister are recalled with admiration even by critics, marked as these were by vast improvement in law and order, though the new dispensation had no dearth of people with criminal background among its rank and file.Realising fully well that unlike Lalu, he did not have the advantage of belonging to a populous caste group, Kumar created sub-quotas among OBCs and Dalits who were called "Ati Pichhda" (EBC) and "Mahadalits", which was resented by the dominant Yadavs and Dusadhs – Paswan's fellow castemen.He also brought in measures like free bicycles and school uniforms for school-going girls, which won him much adulation and the exuberant public mood saw him return to power in 2010, leading the JD(U)-BJP coalition to a landslide victory in the Assembly polls.The period, however, also saw the end of "Atal-Advani era" in the BJP and Kumar, who could not fathom the potential of his then Gujarat counterpart Narendra Modi, locked horns with him over the post-Godhra riots in the western state.Flaunting his secular ideology, Kumar had succeeded in preventing Modi, seen as a polarising figure on account of the Gujarat riots, from campaigning for the BJP Bihar in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls and the Assembly elections a year later, something that still riles Hindutva hardliners.He ultimately snapped his party's 17-year-old ties with the BJP in 2013 when Modi was anointed the BJP's campaign committee chief for the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.After parting ways with the BJP, he won a trust vote with the support of the Congress, but stepped down in 2014, owning moral responsibility for the JD(U)'s drubbing in the Lok Sabha elections, when the party returned with a dismal tally of just two.In less than a year, he was back as the Chief Minister, elbowing out Jitan Ram Manjhi with ample support from the RJD and the Congress, and came to be seen nationally as a potential challenger to Modi.The Grand Alliance that came into being with the JD(U), Congress and RJD coming together, won the 2015 Assembly poll handsomely but came apart in just two years, after Kumar insisted that Lalu's son and Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav, whose name had cropped up in a money laundering case related to the time when RJD supremo was the Railway Minister, "come clear" on the issue.He abruptly resigned as the Chief Minister as the RJD refused to budge, only to be back in office in less than 24 hours with BJP's support.Those who saw a "secular alternative" in Kumar felt let down and cried betrayal of "public mandate".Nitish Kumar, though enfeebled by electoral reverses, is back in the hot seat, belying the prophets of doom.But the mechanical engineer will need to summon all his skills to keep the government machinery humming while navigating the NDA's ship through tricky waters of coalition politics where the tail wagging the dog may not be easy.

16-11-2020||New Delhi||North East Delhi violence: HC grants bail to man accused of rioting and theft||The Delhi High Court has granted bail to a man arrested for alleged rioting and theft during the communal violence in northeast Delhi in February.The court noted that there were no call detail records (CDR) to establish that the accused was available at the site on the particular day.Justice Suresh Kumar Kait granted bail to Saiyad Iftikhar, who was arrested by the Delhi Police on April 11, on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 15,000 and a surety of the like amount.“Keeping in view … the fact that petitioner is in judicial custody since April 11, therefore, I am of the view that the petitioner deserves bail,” the judge said. The high court directed him not to directly or indirectly influence any witness or tamper with the evidence.Iftikhar, represented through advocate Mehmood Pracha, sought bail in the case.Police arrested Iftikhar for the alleged offences of rioting, theft and causing mischief by fire or explosive substance with an intent to destroy a house under the IPC. The case was lodged against him at Police Station Bhajanpura in North East Delhi.The high court noted in its order that it was not in dispute that Iftikhar’s eyesight is weak, having a power of minus 3.75 and when he was arrested he was wearing spectacles.The petitioner was arrested on the basis of CCTV footage along with co accused Ali Hasan but the admitted fact is that in CCTV footage, Iftikhar is not wearing spectacles.“The alleged incident is dated February 24 at 21:31.50 hour. Thus, it cannot be believed that a person having such weak eye sight would have clear vision at night without spectacles. Moreover, CDR is not on record, whereby it could have been established that the petitioner was available at the site,” the court said.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.  --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/north-east-delhi-violence-hc-grants-bail-to-man-accused-of-rioting-and-theft-171142

Actually, at the perch which I sit, there are 3 Cs. The third 'C' of course is on our northern border, which is another challenge that we are facing."In such an environment, cyber-attacks have gone up multi-fold. There is 4 lakh malware, we find every day. 375 cyber-attacks take place," Pant said at an event organised by largest private sector lender HDFC Bank.He said apart from falling prey to voice call-based frauds, people should also be very careful about the click-baits, which are deployed to extract information from an internet user."This disease of just clicking on the link, this is another reason where the malware drops," he said, asking everybody to study the recent cases of frauds at City Union Bank where a person entered the core banking system through a click, and also the ones at Bangladesh Bank and Cosmos Bank.Vulnerabilities will continue to exist and the only solution against those is personal cyber hygiene and technological steps, Pant added.HDFC Bank launched the 'Mooh Bandh Rakho' campaign to create awareness through various mediums, including over 1,000 secure banking workshops and also a rap-song. Bank officials said the target is to focus on the youth."The issue is some of us get unawares and that's how problems start occurring.

The Jainacharya established many institutions for girl children, and brought women to the mainstream." The Prime Minister said the life of Acharya Vijay Vallabh ji was full of kindness, compassion and love for every living being and that with his blessings, bird Hospital and many gaushalas are running in the country today."These are not ordinary institutions.

The mandate is for a change, and against the (ruling) NDA. The peoples verdict has been changed by the rulers order," the RJD alleged in a tweet."Ask the unemployed, the farmer, the contract worker and teacher as to what they are going through. People are angry with NDAs fraud. We are public representatives and we stand with people," it said.The RJD, which emerged as the single largest party in Bihar with 75 seats, also claimed the state is getting a "helpless government by the two helpless parties".Attacking Kumar, it said Bihar will have a "Chief Minister who has been proven weak, idle and corrupt.

Peoples support for the RJD 2.Tejashwi Yadav being elected as Bihar's most popular leader," it said in the tweet.The party also took a dig at Kumar's reported remark at Sunday's NDA meeting that he did not want to become CM but was insisted by the BJP to continue in the post."I did not want to become chief minister because my party came third and also I was tired. But, several BJP leaders grabbed my feet, started crying and pleading before me. I, being a soft-hearted, power-hungry mendicant, was moved. How could I annoy them," the RJD said in a tweet laced with sarcasm.In the election results for 243 assembly seats announced on November 10, the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan lost to the four parties NDA.The BJP is the largest party within the ruling coalition with 74 seats, followed by JD-U (43) and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) and Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) four each.The BJP had announced before the polls that Kumar will remain chief minister irrespective of which NDA constituent wins the maximum number of seats.

16-11-2020||New Delhi||Zoom meetings linked to negative self-image, increase in plastic surgery demand, experts say||Spending more time on virtual platforms could be affecting self-image of people and leading them to rush for facial treatments they may not have considered months before confronting a video screen, a new phenomenon called ‘Zoom Dysmorphia’, experts say.Writing in the journal Facial Plastic Surgery & Aesthetic Medicine, the authors noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had seen a massive shift towards remote work and living, with people spending record amounts of time on virtual platforms with evidence indicating that these remote trends will persist even when conditions improve.Zoom had allowed life to go on in an ever-changing world but may be affecting the way individuals view themselves, they said.The authors noted a surge in patients citing their appearance on Zoom as a reason to seek care, particularly concerned with acne and wrinkles.“A recent analysis of Google search trends during the pandemic showed the terms ‘acne’ and ‘hair loss’ are increasing in this newly virtual reality,” the researchers said.They attributed this trend to the association of acne and hair loss with anxiety and depression, common psychological conditions during quarantine.“We suspect the trend may also arise from people constantly seeing themselves on video and becoming more aware of their appearance,” said Arianne Shadi Kourosh, from Massachusetts General Hospital, US, and one of the authors of the article.Before Zoom took over as the metric used to value one’s appearance, people used selfies and an arsenal of photo editing apps to create filtered versions of themselves.Dubbed “Snapchat dysmorphia,” the influx of people hoping to look more like their edited selves has caused widespread concern for its potential to trigger body dysmorphic disorder.The authors noted that in 2019, 72 per cent of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery members reported seeing patients seeking cosmetic procedures to improve their selfies.In addition, higher levels of engagement on social media have shown to correlate with increased body dissatisfaction, they said.“Unlike the still and filtered selfies of social media, Zoom displays an unedited version of oneself in motion, a self-depiction very few people are used to seeing on a daily basis,” explained Emmy Graber from the Dermatology Institute of Boston, US.“This may have drastic effects on body dissatisfaction and desire to seek cosmetic procedures,” Graber said.The reasons behind this critical self-image, noted the researchers, is that during real-life conversations, people do not see their faces speaking and displaying emotions, and do not compare their faces side-by-side to others like they do on video calls.In addition, cameras can distort video quality and create an inaccurate representation of true appearance, they said.“One study found that a portrait taken from 12 inches away increases perceived nose size by 30 per cent when compared with that taken at 5 feet,” said Shauna M Rice from Massachusetts General Hospital.“Webcams, inevitably recording at shorter focal lengths, tend to produce an overall more rounded face, wider set eyes, and broader nose,” Rice added.The researchers noted that it is important for patients to recognise the limitations of webcams and understand that they are, at best, a flawed representation of reality.  To further deconstruct the motivations behind this influx of patients in the era of Zoom, the authors turned to the facial feedback hypothesis.The theory explains that treatment of sad-appearing wrinkles may reduce depression by making the patient appear less sad to others, which, in turn, makes them feel better about themselves.“Perhaps there is a recent surge in patients seeking cosmetic procedures simply because they now see their imperfections on camera daily, or because the wrinkles they see on screen make them look more depressed to others and feel more depressed themselves,” the authors added.“The theory in the context of Zoom is particularly interesting, as the patient is also the viewer,” they said.They may perceive themselves as sad because of the wrinkles they see, which further negatively affects their emotions, leading to a dangerous cycle of self-deprecation, the authors said.This becomes a major concern when an individual becomes excessively preoccupied with real or imagined defects, they added.

16-11-2020||New Delhi||Media persons played important role in educating people, mitigating impact of COVID-19: Kovind||Media persons have been among frontline corona warriors who played an important role in educating people and mitigating the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, President Ram Nath Kovind said on Monday.In his written message on the occasion of the National Press Day, the president also appreciated the Press Council of India (PCI), which regulates the print media, for safeguarding the independence of the press."I am happy to learn that the Press Council of India is celebrating National Press Day on November 16 on the theme 'Role of Media during COVID-19 and its Impact on the Media'."Rendering its service for nearly 55 years, PCI has been the watchdog safeguarding the independence of the press while trying to ensure quality journalism. Its role is important in the working of our democracy," Kovind said.The president said the theme of this year's National Press Day celebration deals with the most serious crisis facing the world and India."In dealing with the issues concerning COVID 19, media has played a very important role in educating people and thereby it has helped in mitigating the impact of the pandemic."Media persons have been among the frontline corona warriors. Through PCI, I convey my appreciation to such media persons," Kovind said.Media doing exceptional work in spreading awareness against COVID-19, is valuable stakeholder: PM The media has been doing exceptional service by spreading awareness against COVID-19 and has acted as a valuable stakeholder in helping the government in its initiatives, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on the occasion of National Press Day on Monday.Be it positive criticism or highlighting success stories, the media has been continuously adding strength to India's democratic ethos, the prime minister added in his written message on the day, being celebrated virtually with a webinar organised by the Press Council of India.  “From creating mass awareness about important issues to contributing to a behavioural change in society for the larger good, we have seen how the media as a valued stakeholder has furthered the efforts of the government and helped many initiatives like Swachh Bharat and water conservation grow into mass movements in the last few years," he said.Amit Shah greets media on National Press Day     Union Home Minister Amit Shah greeted journalists on the occasion of the National Press Day on Monday and said the Narendra Modi government is committed towards the freedom of press and strongly opposes those who throttle it.Any attack on freedom of the press is detrimental to national interests: Vice Prez      Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Monday said that any attack on the freedom of the press is detrimental to national interests and should be opposed by one and all.He also said that democracy cannot survive without a free and fearless press.Naidu made the remarks in a video message at a webinar on 'Role of media during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on media" organised by the Press Council of India to mark the National Press Day. He said press in India has always been at the vanguard of protecting and strengthening the foundations of democracy. "A robust, free and vibrant media is as important as an independent judiciary in consolidating democracy and strengthening constitutional rule of law," the vice president opined.At the same time, Naidu advised the media to be fair, objective and accurate in its reporting. "Sensationalism should be avoided and the tendency to mix news with views needs to be curbed. Also, there should be greater space for development news in our reporting," he said."Democracy cannot survive without a free and fearless press. Therefore, any attack on the freedom of the press is detrimental to national interests and should be opposed by one and all," he said.The vice president also praised print and electronic media journalists for turning into frontline warriors in the wake of COVID-19 and ensuring non-stop coverage of all the happenings, unmindful of the grave risks associated with the pandemic."My deepest appreciation to each and every journalist, cameraman and others, who have been striving constantly to disseminate news and information," he said.Naidu also stressed the importance of conveying the right information at the right time in a pandemic, "especially when there is a plethora of fake news".Pointing to the need to guard against unverified and unsubstantiated claims, the vice president said media has a huge role in educating the masses in this regard.He also conveyed his condolences to the families of the journalists who succumbed to coronavirus.Referring to the adverse impact of COVID-19 crisis on the media industry, he said it has led some newspapers to curtail their editions and go digital. "There have been unfortunate instances of employees being laid off in both print and electronic media," Naidu said.Stating that journalists should not be left "high and dry" in these difficult times, the vice president appealed to all stakeholders to come together and find innovative solutions to the extraordinary situation created by the pandemic.Observing that the pandemic has underscored the need for media organisations to adopt flexible and resilient business models, Naidu pointed out that more and more people were staying at home and increasingly relying on the media and the entertainment industry for the latest information and to fight the isolation caused by a lack of social interactions.Citing the huge popularity of the re-telecast of teleserial Ramayana and Mahabharata as an example, the vice president suggested to the media industry to tap into increased audience base and explore alternative ways to improve its financial health.

16-11-2020||Patna||RJD veteran Shivanand Tiwari stirs hornet’s nest with Rahul’s criticism; Congress hits back||The Congress’ dismal performance in the Bihar assembly elections has drawn biting criticism from ally RJD, with party veteran leader Shivanand Tiwari saying the grand old party had “shackled” the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ in the state.Tiwari’s remarks made during interviews with TV channels prompted calls for his outster from the RJD.“Congress shackled the ‘Mahagathbandhan’ with chains in the assembly elections. It contested 70 seats but did not hold even 70 rallies. Rahul Gandhi visited Bihar on three days and addressed two rallies a day. Priyanka Gandhi was not seen at all. When electioneering was at its peak, he was picnicking with Priyanka Gandhi in Shimla,” Tiwari, who is considered close to RJD supremo Lalu Prasad and is part of its old guard, said.The Congress reacted sharply to Tiwari’s criticism.“Shivanand Tiwari is not an official spokesman for the RJD. He is hand in gloves with the BJP and JD(U) and is speaking their language. He is talking like Giriraj Singh (union minister). It’s time such a loud-mouthed and mentally bankrupt man is thrown out of his party,” AICC media panel member and MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said.He later tweeted in Hindi that an RJD leader speaking the “language of Giriraj Singh and Shahnawaz Hussain” was unacceptable to the Congress.“There is something called the coalition Dharma and all parties should follow it,” he wrote on the microblogging website.RJD spokespersons Mrityunjay Tiwari and Chittaranjan Gagan said Tiwari’s were his personal views and his statements did not reflect the party’s stand.“Shivanand Tiwari is a senior leader and a guardian to us. But the views expressed by him are personal. Tejashwi Yadav and other senior leaders of the RJD will analyse the election outcome,” Gagan said.Congress national general secretary Tariq Anwar, who had called for “deep introspection” following the party’s abysmal performance in the Bihar polls, defended Rahul Gandhi, saying the leader of a national party cannot be expected to devote time and energy to a state poll like the leader of a regional outfit.“First of all, Shivanand Tiwari is not an authorised spokesperson for the RJD. Also, he should realise that Congress is a national party while the RJD is a regional entity. The leader of a national party cannot be expected to devote time to a state election like a regional leader would,” he said.The Congress had contested 70 seats of the 243-member assembly but could manage to win just 19.Prominent Congress candidates for whom Rahul Gandhi had campaigned but who lost included Shubhanand Mukesh, the son of former state assembly speaker Sadanand Singh, a multiple-term MLA from Kahalgaon, and Subhashini Raj Rao, the daughter of socialist veteran leader Sharad Yadav in Bihariganj.

16-11-2020||New Delhi||SC issues notice on plea against arrest of Kerala scribe on way to Hathras||The Supreme Court Monday issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government on a petition filed by Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) challenging the arrest of its member Siddique Kappan while on his way to Hathras to cover the death of a Dalit woman who died after allegedly being gang-raped. The rape-cum-murder case is being probed by the CBI probe. After the September 14 incident, the 19-year-old woman had died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital during treatment and her body was cremated at night near her home on September 30.  Siddique Kappan was arrested on October 5 on his way to Hathras. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde posted the matter for hearing on Friday even as it wondered why the KUWJ did not approach the Allahabad High Court and directly came to it. Earlier, senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing KUWJ, sought bail for the Kappan, saying “The FIR does not name him. No offences alleged. He has been in jail since October 5.”Earlier, the top court had said it would hear the plea after four weeks and in the meantime, the petitioner could approach the Allahabad high court for the relief.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-on-plea-against-arrest-of-kerala-scribe-on-way-to-hathras-171102
16-11-2020||Toledo (US)||Pandemic pushes steep drop in foreign college students||Just two semesters short of earning a cybersecurity master's degree in the US, Sai Naini is stuck in India, unsure what his future holds.He rushed home this summer after learning that his father was in failing health after being diagnosed with COVID-19, making it to his hospital bedside only four hours before he died.“He was emotional; he was in tears,” Naini said. “I was fortunate to see him. I think he was waiting to see someone who would take care of my mother, and then he left.”  Two months later, when the 28-year-old was ready to return to the University of Toledo, his visa application was denied even though he had letters from his college advisers explaining why he had gone home and that he already was enrolled in classes. The only explanation he got, he said, was that he was turned down “based on guidelines they received from the White House.”  “Everything changed,” he said.“The goals I had changed. The milestones I had changed.”  Complications and new policies brought on by the coronavirus pandemic have stopped thousands of international students from attending universities in the U.S. this fall, raising concerns that the steep decline could foretell a long-lasting shift for universities that have come to rely on attracting international students. At risk are millions of dollars in tuition for the universities and some of the world's brightest minds for U.S. employers.While the number of new international enrollees has been on the decline during the past few years because of new rules limiting student visas and competition from other countries, the pandemic has been a crushing blow.This fall, new international students enrolled at U.S. universities online or in-person fell by 43%, according to a survey of more than 700 schools released Monday. That's the largest decrease recorded by the Institute of International Education, which has been publishing data on international enrollment since 1954.Including both new and returning students, total international enrollment fell by 16%. The survey found that among those who did enrol at U.S. colleges, about one in five were studying online from abroad.Some of the nation's largest universities saw big losses. The number of undergraduate and graduate international students at Michigan State University was down 20% and the University of Texas fell by 17%, while Arizona State University and Ohio State University each reported declines of 15%.Administrators agree the pandemic caused a wide variety of hurdles for students, ranging from financial strains brought on by job losses to worries over a Trump administration proposal that sought to force international students to leave if their schools held online-only classes.With American consulates closed in many countries, quite a few first-time students were unable to get visas, while others were stranded because of travel restrictions and flight cancellations.Universities were flooded with questions from worried parents who wanted to know where their children would live if schools closed their dorms and what would happen if they got sick. Some decided to stay home because of those unknowns.“At a human level, we can all relate to that,” said Barbara Kappler, assistant dean of International Student & Scholar Services at the University of Minnesota, which saw a 15% decline.It all has forced students to make tough choices. One University of Toledo student decided not to go home even though two relatives had died of COVID-19, said Tracey Hidalgo, the school's assistant director for international student services.“They just bawl their eyes out and tell me 'no' because they're worried they're not going to be able to come back,” she said.Compounding the problems of the pandemic is a growing belief that the U.S. is no longer as welcoming for international scholars because of President Donald Trump's repeated moves to curb immigration.“The confluence of the pandemic and these policies has created an incredibly tough situation,” said Leonardo Villalon, Dean of the University of Florida's International Center. “International higher education is under the greatest stress it has been in decades.” The sudden drop in enrollment will be felt in budgets at colleges because foreign students typically pay higher tuition rates. The University of Illinois alone estimates it will lose about $26 million this semester. But the impact goes beyond that.High-tech companies depend on foreign-born people who come to the U.S. for training, Villalon said.“Where do we want the best and brightest young people in the world to go?” he said. “If you're running a research lab studying the coronavirus, you want the very best in there.”There's hope among some college administrators that President-elect Joe Biden will carry through with promises to reverse some of Trump's immigration orders. Biden also has proposed giving foreign graduates of U.S. doctoral programs a pathway to citizenship.But U.S. universities are facing increased competition from countries, including Canada and Australia, that are trying to woo more foreign students. And China is heavily investing in its colleges.Ousmane Barry, a refugee from Guinea who moved to Italy when he was 16, though he'd be starting classes this fall on an academic scholarship at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington.But his visa application was turned down because he could not show enough ties to his home country. He's still holding out hope that he'll get another chance. (AP)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pandemic-pushes-steep-drop-in-foreign-college-students-171101
16-11-2020||Mumbai||Ex-Navy officer who served during World War II dies at 97||Vice Admiral John Thomas Goslin Pereira (retd), Indian Navy's former Chief of Materials, died here on Monday after a brief illness, family sources said.The 97-year-old was among the last surviving naval officers who served during the Second World War, Vice Adm I C Rao (retd), who served with him on board warship INS Delhi in 1958, told PTI.Vice Admiral Pereira, who had settled at the Uran coastal town in adjoining Raigad district after his retirement in 1979, died in the wee hours at naval hospital INSH Asvini in south Mumbai, he said.'JTG" as he was known in Navy circles, was the Chief Staff Officer (Tech) of the Western Naval Command during the 1971 war. He was awarded the Param Vishisht Seva Medal (PVSM) for distinguished service during the war."It was the painstaking preparation of the fleet and missile boats under the leadership of JTG which won us laurels during the 1971 war," Vice Adm Rao said.Born in February 1923 at Kannur in Kerala, he was commissioned in the Royal Navy on May 1, 1944.Vice Adm Pereira joined the Royal Naval College Dartmouth, UK as a cadet in 1939 and graduated from the Royal Naval Engineering College Plymouth in Mechanical and Marine Engineering.A year later he completed his post-graduation from Royal Naval College Greenwich, UK, in Advanced Engineering and Design Propulsion Systems. He was among the 15 selected from India for an Industrial Management Course conducted by France in Paris.During his four-decade-long career in the Navy, he held with distinction many important appointments both ashore and at sea. He had also directed the R&D work for the Navy.He served in the Mumbai's Naval Dockyard, first as the Industrial Manager and later as the Admiral Superintendent, and was instrumental in creating the shipyards Production Planning and Control Department.JTG is survived by son Michael Pereira (71) and daughter Jennifer (67), Vice Adm Rao said.

16-11-2020||New Delhi||Justice Lalit recuses from hearing PILs against AP CM||Supreme Court judge UU Lalit on Monday recused himself from hearing pleas seeking action against Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy for levelling allegations against the judiciary.“I have difficulties. As a lawyer I had represented one of the parties. I will pass an order for it to be listed before a Bench without me,” Justice Lalit said.A bench comprising justices Lalit, Vineet Saran and S Ravindra Bhat was to hear three petitions seeking various reliefs against Reddy.The pleas alleged that Reddy not only wrote a letter to Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde levelling allegations against the judiciary but also held a press conference in which false statements were made.In an unprecedented move, the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister had on October 6 written to the CJI alleging that the Andhra Pradesh High Court was being used to “destabilise and topple my democratically elected government”.The three separate petitions were filed by advocates G S Mani, Sunil Kumar Singh and Anti-Corruption Council of India Trust.

16-11-2020||New Delhi||Nitish Kumar takes oath as Bihar Chief Minister for seventh time in 2 decades||Nitish Kumar was on Monday sworn in as the Chief Minister of Bihar for the seventh time in two decades, in presence of top leaders of the NDA, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP national president Jagat Prakash Nadda, but as political observers said, with “diminished clout and strength”.The BJP, which won as many as 74 seats to emerge as top scorer in the NDA team, has given him two deputies Tarkishore Prasad (Katihar MLA) and Renu Devi (Bettiah MLA) in place of Sushil Modi whose resettlement plans are still under wraps.Also read: Nitish Kumar: Masterful craftsman of realpolitik who believes politics is the art of possibleKumar BJP-nominated CM, tired and politically ‘belittled’: Prashant KishorRJD to boycott Nitish Kumar's oath-taking ceremonyTejashwi wishes Nitish Kumar on being nominated Bihar CM Kumar was sworn at a ceremony attended by top BJP leaders including Home Minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda.The selection of senior leaders Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi is aimed to infuse freshness in Bihar leadership and send a clear message to the cadres.They suit the critical caste combinations as also the party’s aim to revamp, expand and form the next government on its own in the state.“The BJP was portrayed as a party of upper castes and Prasad and Renu Devi represent underprivileged sections. The move is also an indication that things are not going to be the same, there was too much proximity between Nitish Kumar and Sushil Modi and obviously the central leadership also wanted to change the status quo. It is a new beginning for Bihar BJP,” observers said.While the BJP dabbles in caste chemistry to expand beyond the traditional upper caste support base, the selection of Renu Devi is also being seen as an effort to engage women voters who are believed to have supported Prime Minister Narendra Modi majorly in these elections. So far as four-time deputy CM Sushil Modi is concerned, speculations are he may be accommodated in the Narendra Modi Cabinet in the Centre via the Rajya Sabha or sent to a Raj Bhavan.आदरणीय @NitishKumar जी को फिर से मुख्यमंत्री बनने की बधाई। आशा करता हूँ सरकार अपना कार्यकाल पुरा करेगी और आप एन॰डी॰ए॰ के ही मुख्यमंत्री बने रहेंगे।  Meanwhile, induction of JD(U)’s Vijay Kumar Chaudhary, who was the Speaker in the Assembly for past five years, proves the BJP’s hard bargain for the post.The NDA bagged 125 seats in the 243-member assembly. Individually the saffron party won 31 more seats than 43 of Kumar’s JD(U), which had 71 MLAs in 2015. Though detractors believe BJP managed to wrest power with help of smart permutations and combinations and ‘vote katua’ strategy “otherwise how could Tejashwi Yadav, despite a larger share, end up with no power”.With 75 MLAs, RJD is the single largest party. In terms of vote share also the RJD topped with 23.1 per cent followed by the BJP at 19.5 per cent, 15.4 per cent of the JD (U) and others at 18.8 per cent.The difference of votes between NDA and ‘mahagathbandhan’ is of a few thousand.Smart strategising by central leadership, Shah, Nadda, Bhupendra Yadav, not just managed to get BJP the lead but become the dominant force in the NDA.“Nitish Kumar may no longer have the same say as earlier with Sushil Modi who was almost seen as his aide,” say observers.Though senior BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have endorsed Nitish Kumar, speculations continue to do rounds about the viability of the new government.Meanwhile, apart from Kumar, Prasad and Renu Devi, five MLAs from BJP and JD(U) and one each from HAM and VIP were sworn in the Cabinet which may be expanded at a later stage. The new ministers include Mukesh Sahni, the president of VIP which won four seats though he lost, and Santosh Kumar Suman, whose father Jitan Ram Manjhi is former CM and president of HAM.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nitish-kumar-takes-oath-as-bihar-chief-minister-for-seventh-time-in-2-decades-171092

16-11-2020||New Delhi||Rain, gusty winds bring pollution levels down in Delhi-NCR||Light rain and favourable wind speed brought pollution levels down significantly in Delhi and its suburbs on Monday, while weather experts said the air quality is likely to improve further.The city’s air quality index (AQI) improved to 300 at 9 am, which falls in the poor category, from 467 around the same time on Sunday.The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (256), Ghaziabad (292), Greater Noida (302), Gurgaon (314) and Noida (312) recorded their AQI in “poor” and very poor” categories after braving “severe” air quality on Saturday and Sunday.Delhi had recorded the worst pollution levels on Diwali in the last four years due to the combined effect of stubble burning, firecrackers and unfavourable meteorological conditions.The air quality on the day after Diwali was also the poorest since 2016.The city recorded an overall AQI of 414 on Saturday (Diwali). On Sunday, the 24-hour average AQI stood at 435.In a special report, the Central Pollution Control Board said that almost all pollutants reported higher values on Diwali day this year as compared to 2019.It could be attributed to bursting of firecrackers, higher share of stubble burning and unfavourable meteorology during the festival season, the CPCB said.However, rain and high-velocity winds came to Delhi’s rescue this year.Winds gusting up to 40 kilometre per hour swept away the pollutants, while light rainfall in the afternoon and evening on Sunday washed everything down.Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the India Meteorological Department, said wind speed would be favourable for dispersion of pollutants on Monday as well.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, had also predicted that pollution levels may recede to the “poor” category “in case of enough rains and washout”.The air quality was likely to stay in the “very poor” category on Tuesday and Wednesday, it said.

16-11-2020||Mumbai||Places of worship reopen in Maharashtra; devotees visit temples||Places of religious worship in Maharashtra, which were shut since the imposition of COVID-19 lockdown in March, reopened on Monday with devotees visiting some of the prominent temples and shrines in the state.The reopening of the places of worship coincided with the Diwali ‘Padwa’, which is an important festival in the state.Early in the morning, devotees were seen visiting Lord Vitthal’s temple at Pandharpur in Satara, Saibaba’s shrine in Shirdi, Goddess Tulja Bhavani’s temple in Osmanabad and the famous Siddhivinayak temple in Mumbai.The Siddhivinayak temple’s chairman Aadesh Bandekar on Sunday said only 1,000 devotees will be allowed inside the temple every day in staggered time slots to be booked through a mobile phone application.As per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) released by the state government, religious places located out of COVID-19 containment zones have been allowed to reopen as per the timings decided by authorities, and devotees will be allowed inside in a staggered manner.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday announced reopening of the places of worship but also cautioned people, saying it cannot be forgotten that the “demon of coronavirus” still persists and called for following discipline.The opposition BJP in the state had been seeking reopening of the places of worship and earlier questioned the Thackeray government’s decision to not reopen temples at a time when bars were allowed to reopen.The Chief Minister, however, had defended his decision saying it was difficult to follow physical distancing at the places of worship.The issue had also led to a stand-off between Thackeray and state Governor BS Koshyari, who reminded the Shiv Sena president of his Hindutva credentials and asked if he had turned secular.Koshyari’s letter to the Chief Minister was criticised by constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.Thackeray had said after places of worship were reopened, rules and safety protocols had to be followed strictly and laid stress on wearing masks.“If we follow discipline, we will get God’s blessings,” Thackeray had said.According to the SOPs laid down by the government, only asymptomatic people will be allowed inside places of worship and wearing of face mask is mandatory for devotees.The number of people to be allowed inside such places in a particular time slot will be decided on the size of the structure and ventilation.Devotees will have to maintain social distancing, while management of such places will have to conduct thermal scanning and make available hand wash or sanitisers, according to the SOPs.Local authorities can further add any directions to these guidelines taking into consideration local conditions.Footwear should be preferably taken off inside vehicles, the guidelines said.Touching of statues, holy books, idols is not allowed and large gatherings continue to remain prohibited.In view of the potential threat of spread of the coronavirus infection, only recorded devotional music should be played and choir or singing groups are not allowed, as per the SOPs.Among other guidelines, common prayer mats should be avoided and devotees should bring their own prayer mats or pieces of cloth, which they can take back with them.Physical offering of ‘prasad’, distribution or sprinkling of holy water is not allowed.Floors at places of worship should be cleaned multiple times in a day, and community kitchens and ‘langars’ should follow physical distancing, the guidelines said.Effective sanitisation of the premises should be done with a particular focus on lavatories, and hand and foot washing stations.Workers at places of worship will have to undergo pre-joining and weekly COVID-19 tests for highly exposed groups, as per the SOPs.

16-11-2020||---||As I might have wished otherwise, there was no Mahatma Gandhi around to hold such impulses back, says Obama in his book||New Delhi, November 16Former US president Barack Obama describes former PM Manmohan Singh as a “man of uncommon wisdom and decency” in his first volume of memoirs.Much attention was riveted in India so far on a stray sentence from his memoirs about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in his 900-page memoir, ‘A Promised Land’. He says that a decade back, Rahul had a “nervous, unformed quality about him, as if he were a student who’d done the coursework and was eager to impress the teacher but deep down lacked either the aptitude or the passion to master the subject”.Rahul, “as good-looking as Sonia’’, seemed smart and earnest who probed Obama on his 2008 campaign and reiterated progressive views. Sonia was a “striking woman in her 60s” who “listened more than she spoke, careful to defer to Singh” when policy matters came up, and often steered the conversation towards her son.“It became clear to me, though, that her power was attributable to a shrewd and forceful intelligence,” he adds.A private conversation with Singh and his musings proved prophetic. “What I couldn’t tell was whether Singh’s rise to power represented the future of India’s democracy or merely an aberration.…….. the PM spoke more openly about the clouds he saw on the horizon…Singh had resisted calls to retaliate against Pakistan after the Mumbai attacks, but his restraint had cost him politically. He feared that rising anti-Muslim sentiment had strengthened the influence of India’s main opposition party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“In uncertain times, Mr President,” the PM said, “the call of religious and ethnic solidarity can be intoxicating. And it’s not so hard for politicians to exploit that, in India or anywhere else.’’This sentence led Obama to recall his conversation with (former Iron Wall dissident, Nobel Laureate and former Czech President) Václav Havel about the rising tide of ill-liberalism in Europe that globalisation and an economic crisis were fuelling in relatively wealthy nations.Obama was seeing it in the US with the Tea Party and felt the truth about India was that it still bore little resemblance to the egalitarian, peaceful, and sustainable society Gandhi had envisioned. Expressing hostility towards Pakistan was still the quickest route to national unity, with many Indians taking great pride that their country had developed a nuclear weapons programme to match Pakistan’s.Before landing in Mumbai on his first visit to India, the country had held a special place in his imagination. It was partly because of India’s sheer size, and also because he had spent part of his childhood in Indonesia listening to the Ramayana and the Mahābhārata. It could have been due to his interest in the Eastern religions, or because of a group of Pakistani and Indian college friends who’d taught him to cook dal and keema and introduced him to Bollywood movies.More than anything, though, his fascination with India had to do with Mahatma Gandhi whom he puts on par with Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela. “Gandhi’s actions had stirred me even more than his words; he’d put his beliefs to the test by risking his life, going to prison, and throwing himself fully into the struggles of his people.’’On a visit to Mani Bhavan, Gandhi’s home base for many years in Mumbai, Obama felt the “strongest wish to ask Gandhi where he had found the strength and imagination to “do so much with so very little. To ask how he’d recovered from disappointment?’’Gandhi, like Obama in office, had to settle for less. “For all his extraordinary gifts, Gandhi hadn’t been able to heal the subcontinent’s deep religious schisms or prevent its partitioning….a seismic event in which untold numbers died. Despite his labours, he hadn’t undone India’s stifling caste system. Somehow, though, he’d marched, fasted, and preached well into his seventies—until that final day in 1948, when on his way to prayer, he was shot at point-blank range by a young Hindu extremist who viewed his ecumenism as a betrayal of the faith.’’In a clear-eyed view of modern Indian politics and the power structure at the top in 2010, Obama said Singh’s elevation as PM is sometimes heralded as a hallmark of the country’s progress in overcoming sectarian divides. But, it was “somewhat deceiving”.“He hadn’t originally become PM as a result of his own popularity…he owed his position to Sonia…more than one political observer believed that she’d chosen Singh precisely because as an elderly Sikh with no national political base, he posed no threat to her 40-year-old son, Rahul, whom she was grooming to take over the Congress Party.’’After leaving the dinner where he briefly assessed Rahul and Sonia, Obama wondered what would happen when Singh left office. “Would the baton be successfully passed to Rahul, fulfilling the destiny laid out by his mother and preserving the Congress Party’s dominance over the divisive nationalism touted by the BJP?’’Obama was again prescient. “Somehow, I was doubtful. It wasn’t Singh’s fault. He had done his part….Except now I found myself asking whether the all-too-human desire to beat back our own uncertainty and mortality and sense of insignificance by subordinating others—were too strong for any democracy to permanently contain.’’“And as much as I might have wished otherwise, there was no Mahatma Gandhi around to hold such impulses back.’’Obama’s second volume of memoirs will deal with the American perception about the corruption scandals of UPA 2, his subsequent meetings with Singh and, about his interactions with PM Narendra Modi. India in the first volume featured about 3,200 words. Half of it related to his first India visit in 2010 and the rest about Obama and Hillary crashing a secretive India-South-Africa-Brazil-China confabulation. Lula and Jacob Zuma “looked sheepishly down’’ at the papers in front of them but true to form, Singh along with Wen Jiabao “remained impassive”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-i-might-have-wished-otherwise-there-was-no-mahatma-gandhi-around-to-hold-such-impulses-back-says-obama-in-his-book-171061

The air quality index (AQI) for PM 2.5 pollutants on Sunday ranged between 460 and 500 across New Delhi as it posted the highest daily new Covid infections of 7,340.The AQI from 101 to 200 is considered moderate, 201 to 300 poor, 301 to 400 very poor and 401 to 500 severe.As Delhi defied the firecracker ban, average 24-hour AQI recorded on Diwali day was 414 — the worst in four years. In 2019, the 24-hour average AQI was 337 on Diwali as against 281 in 2018 and 319 in 2017. The neighbouring cities were no different as revellers violated the NGT order prohibiting the sale and bursting of firecrackers in the NCR. The order was meant as a drastic measure to check pollution, which is further fuelling Covid complications.Gurugram recorded an AQI of 424, followed by Noida (466), Ghaziabad (483), Faridabad (438) and Greater Noida (439) — all in severe pollution category as the NCR woke up to a thick blanket of smog.Weather experts said the Sunday showers would lower the air pollution levels with winds likely to change course to south-east, thus reducing the impact of pollutants on account of farm fires in the neighbouring states.On Saturday, the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ pollution forecasting platform, SAFAR, said Delhi’s AQI around Diwali would be much better than previous four years, if the NGT ban worked.But the ban was flouted, as were the 2019 Supreme Court directions curbing the use of firecrackers.Following an order of the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Science had launched an initiative to produce green firecrackers with the involvement of industry, but such eco-friendly firecrackers were hardly used.FIRs lodged against violators in HaryanaChandigarh: The police lodged several FIRs against those violating Diwali firecracker ban in Haryana on Saturday even as the air quality index (AQI) deteriorated from “very poor” to “severe” in a majority of the districts in the state. In Faridabad, which recorded an AQI of 438, the police booked three men on the charge of violating the ban on the sale of crackers. The Panipat police registered eight cases in connection with the sale of firecrackers. In Yamunanagar and Ambala, 16 cases were lodged for allegedly sale and use of crackers.Punjab AQI dips from ‘poor’ to ‘very poor’Patiala: Despite a ban on traditional crackers, a majority of cities in Punjab witnessed a drastic increase in air pollution levels on Diwali, with the air quality deteriorating to “very poor” category compared to “poor” last year. A layer of haze and smog was visible in many cities and villages as the two-hour window for bursting of crackers went up for a toss. Crackers were burst till wee hours in most cities. According to the Punjab Pollution Control Board, the state’s average air quality index for Punjab in 2019 was recorded at 293 (“poor”), which dipped to 328 (“very poor”) on Saturday night.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ban-not-enforced-delhi-air-worst-in-4-years-170954

16-11-2020||He earned sobriquet of Ray’s alter ego ||Bengal’s iconic actor leaves behind a rich legacy||Nonika SinghThe doyen of Bengali cinema, Soumitra Chatterjee, breathed his last in Kolkata on Sunday after battling post-Covid complications, leaving the world of cinema poorer.He is best known for his association with Satyajit Ray with whom he worked in over 14 films. It is believed that Ray especially made the third part of his famous “Apu” trilogy after having met Soumitra.Soumitra began his filmy career with “Apur Sansar” in 1959. He played “Feluda”, Ray’s character from his detective book series, in “Sonar Kella” and “Joi Baba Felunath”. Soumitra was also directed by thespians Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha and Tarun Majumdar.His pan India presence may have been felt as recent as 2015 with short film “Ahalya”, which created a stir and went viral. Director Sujoy Ghosh admitted that the real reason for making the film was to seize the opportunity to work with a great actor like Soumitra.A master-class in acting, his fan list includes brilliant actors like Naseeruddin Shah. If as an actor he could say the same line in 20 different ways, off screen he could not only recite Tagore and other poets, but also write many a sterling poem. He had dozens of books to his credit.His biopic is likely to throw greater light on his journey and achievements dotted with honours such as Padma Bhushan, Dadasaheb Phalke and the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, France’s highest award for artistes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengals-iconic-actor-leaves-behind-a-rich-legacy-170958

But an ASEAN statement a couple of months back had turned down India’s suggestion to start talks right away.Speaking at the summit being held in virtual mode, Jaishankar expressed concern about actions and incidents in the South China Sea that erode trust in the region. He also said the Code of Conduct negotiations on the South China Sea should not be prejudicial to legitimate interests of third parties and should be fully consistent with UNCLOS.Jaishankar also underlined the need for greater international cooperation in the post-Covid world to tackle the challenges cutting across national boundaries such as terrorism, climate change and pandemic, stated a Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) news release.The East Asia summit consists of 10 ASEAN plus eight countries in three rungs — China, Japan and South Korea; India, New Zealand and Australia; and the US and Russia. The Regional Economic Cooperation Partnership (RCEP) was signed on Sunday by all regional players minus India. The US and Russia were not invited.The pact will create Asia’s largest free trade zone and will be Japan’s first FTA framework with China. Other countries will be barred from joining the RCEP for some time, but India will be allowed to participate whenever it chooses to do so.Like Jaishankar, US officials reaffirmed their support for a free and open Indo-Pacific, while they underlined their latest Indo-Japan economic initiative with five ASEAN members in India’s periphery — Cambodia, Lao, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga stressed on the partnership with these five countries on the lower banks of the Mekong river.The summit was chaired by Vietnamese PM Nguyen Xuan Phuc in his capacity as ASEAN Chair.The summit discussed ways to strengthen the EAS platform and to make it more responsive to emerging challenges. Issues such as the South China Sea, situation in Korean peninsula and Rakhine state were discussed. Besides the Ha Noi Declaration, the summit also adopted four other leaders’ statements on marine sustainability; epidemics prevention and response; women, peace and security and steady growth of regional economy, stated the MEA release.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/15-asia-pacific-nations-sign-trade-agreement-sans-india-170959

These youths, who are her neighbours, had tried to outrage her modesty, but when she resisted, they tied her hands and killed her,” said Kanpur’s Deputy IG Preetinder Singh.Singh had said earlier that forensic experts and sniffer dogs were also pressed in to gather scientific evidence to confirm if the girl was killed in any “tantra-mantra” (black magic) act.“The body has been sent for a postmortem. Doctors have also been asked to explore if the girl was murdered in any black magic act,” the DIG had said.The girl had gone missing on Saturday evening while her family was preparing for Diwali prayers.The family tried to search her in neighbouring areas, including the nearby jungle using flashlights, but had failed to locate her during the night, said Singh.The girl’s body was found on Sunday morning in the jungle itself by some villagers passing through it, the DIG said.The injury marks on the upper parts of the body suggested she was killed with some sharp-edged weapon, said another senior official.The girl’s belongings, including slippers and clothes, were also found lying near a tree.Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, meanwhile, taking note of the heinous crime, directed officials to take strict action against the accused.Expressing his condolences for the aggrieved family, the CM also directed officials to give a financial help of Rs 5 lakh to the victim’s family.
