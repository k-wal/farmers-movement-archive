02-11-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan Assembly passes Bills to counter Centre’s farm laws||The Rajasthan Assembly on Monday passed three Bills to counter the farm laws enacted by the Centre with the state following the example of Congress-run Punjab and Chhattisgarh.BJP MLAs staged a walkout just ahead of the voice vote that took place after about eight hours of debate in the House.The Rajasthan Bills mandate that crops will be bought or sold for no less than the minimum support price (MSP) and provide for imprisonment of three to seven years for harassing farmers.However, the Bills become law only after the Governor’s assent, who may withhold and decide to refer them to the President.The Parliament recently enacted farm laws deregulating the sale of agriculture produce. Several farmer unions and the opposition Congress claimed that the move by the BJP government at the Centre will lead to the dismantling of the MSP system.Replying to the debate in the assembly, Rajasthan Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal said the entire country is against the Centre’s new farm.“I can say it with a guarantee that all three farm laws will have to be withdrawn, just like the Land Acquisition Act,” Dhariwal said.Dhariwal said farmers were free to sell their produce anywhere in the country in the existing system, contrary to what has been claimed by the Centre.“Farmers were free to sell their produce anywhere in the country and you are saying that you have freed them. You have worked to handover agriculture mandis directly into the hands of corporate houses,” Dhariwal said.The state parliamentary affairs minister said when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat, he had advocated to make procurement of crops on the MSP mandatory but now everything has changed.The Centre did not work out a formula to calculate the MSP as suggested by the Swaminathan Commission, he said.“None of the Centre’s three laws has a mention about the MSP. So, why should we not have suspicion and level allegations,” he asked.State Power Minister B D Kalla said the Centre’s law proposed that prices of commodities will be controlled only when there is an unprecedented rise in their prices. In such a situation, big players will be able stock the commodities and common people will suffer, he alleged.Defending the central laws, Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria said they were enacted after taking into account recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, which talked about one nation, one market; contract farming; and abolition of indirect mandi taxes.Rajasthan’s Congress government brought the bills just to make the party leaders in Delhi happy, he said.“If someone has worked to bring a change in the farmers’ lives, it is Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Kataria said.The three state Bills passed on Monday are the Essential Commodities (Special Provisions and Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020; and Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation and Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020.In addition, the state assembly also passed the Code of Civil Procedure (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020. The Bill seeks to protect farmers with small holdings from attachment of land.The Congress leadership had earlier suggested that states where it is in power should pass laws of their own to counter the central legislations that had triggered farmers’ protests in several parts of the country.The Rajasthan Bills tweak the Central laws through amendments.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill adds: “Provided further that no farming agreement for the sale or purchase of a crop shall be valid unless the price paid for such agricultural produce is equal to, or greater than, the prevailing minimum support price, announced by the Central Government for that crop.”Three new sections have also been added as special provisions for Rajasthan, specifying punishment for harassment of farmers and powers to the state government to give directions.The Bill proposes imprisonment from three to seven years with or without a fine of Rs 5 lakh if any person, company or association harasses farmers.“There has been extraordinary outrage amongst the farmers, farm labourers and all others engaged in incidental and ancillary agricultural activities,” a statement tabled along with the bill had said.It claimed that the “direct consequences” of the Central Act would be to nullify the MSP mechanism “that has stood the test of time” and introduce “several other infirmities and distortions” that go against farmers.In the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation and Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, one of the amendments relates to regulation of notified agriculture produce.It says the state government may notify a fee or cess on such produce bought or sold by a corporate or trader in a trade area.The three central farm bills—the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 -- were notified as laws in September. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-assembly-passes-bills-to-counter-centres-farm-laws-164974
02-11-2020||---||Man, wife held for killing niece in Delhi||New Delhi, November 2A man and his wife have been arrested for allegedly killing their 17-year-old niece by hitting on her head with an iron rod and later stuffing her body inside a bed box at their house in northeast Delhi’s Nandnagri area, police said on Monday.The minor girl was living with Vakeel Podar (51) and his 45-year-old wife for some time now and was pursuing her studies from Delhi, they said.A decomposed body of the girl found stuffed inside a bed at a house in Leprosy colony complex in Tahirpur area of Nandnagri in northeast Delhi was recovered on October 25, police said.According to the police, the girl had been missing since October 23.Statement of the girl’s aunt was recorded and it came to notice that the woman’s husband, Podar, was also missing from the house and this rose suspicion, they said.During initial investigation, the victim’s aunt told police that on October 23, she left for begging at 5.30 am and when she returned at around 12.30 pm, she didn’t find her niece at home. She enquired the same from her husband Podar, who informed her that he had left her niece in the orphanage at Ghaziabad, police said.During further investigation, it came to notice that Podar was not seen in the locality since October 23, Ved Prakash Surya, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northeast), said.On making an enquiry at the said orphanage in Ghaziabad, it came to light that no girl of the said name was brought there on October 23, he said.“During investigation, it was revealed that Podar was attracted towards the victim and the girl had confided the same to one of the neighbours. It also came to light that Podar’s wife was also aware that her husband had tried to molest the victim on September 28,” the DCP said.On the basis of analysis of call detail record of Podar, one team was sent to Hyderabad and another to his native place in Bihar. He was arrested from a bus stand in Madhepura, Bihar. He was brought to Delhi on transit remand and produced before the court, the officer said.“During interrogation, Podar confessed that the victim was the daughter of his sister-in-law. He had tried to make physical relationship with her one month ago but she objected. When his wife came to know about the incident, she confronted him and they had a quarrel. Although Podar wanted the girl to stay with them, it was decided that she should be sent to the village, to which the victim refused since she wanted to pursue her studies and complete her education. On this, Podar and his wife had clashed several times,” Surya said.On October 23, Podar’s wife, out of anger, asked her husband to kill the girl. While she stayed outside the house to keep a watch on passersby, Podar went inside the room and while the girl was asleep, he hit her head with an iron rod kept in the room. When she started bleeding, he wrapped her in a blanket till she died. Then he stuffed her body in the box of the bed and called his wife inside. Both of them then washed the room and the iron rod, the officer said.They planned to dispose of the body and waited for a whole day looking for an opportunity but failed to do so. Then to mislead everyone, his wife told Podar to leave Delhi and go to the village so that they can come out clean when the body is detected in the house after a few days as the neighbours would think that Podar was outstation and his wife being handicapped will be treated sympathetically and she would cook up a story to cover up, the officer added.The iron rod used in the commission of crime has been recovered, police said. Both the accused are lepers. While Podar is a rickshaw puller, his wife is a beggar. Both of them also get Rs 5,500 as pension from the government, they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-wife-held-for-killing-niece-in-delhi-164971

NDA constituent JD(U) has five seats.The ruling alliance also has some smaller parties like RPI-Athawale, Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), Mizo National Front (MNF), National People’s Party (NPP), Naga People’s Front (NPF), Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), which have one seat each, totalling seven seats.The NDA tally will now be 104 and it can get the support of four nominated members.  The half-way mark is 121 in Rajya Sabha whose current strength is 242.The ruling alliance can also seek support on crucial bills from some friendly parties like the AIADMK with nine MPs, BJD with nine MPs, TRS with seven MPs and YSRCP which has six MPs in Rajya Sabha. These parties have been extending issue-based support to the NDA.The Samajwadi Party has lost three seats in these RS polls in Uttarakhand and UP and the BSP lost one seat.With the ruling combine further strengthened, it will be easier for the government to push its legislative agenda in the Upper House, where the NDA did not enjoy a majority.Those elected unopposed today included BJP’s Neeraj Shekhar, Arun Singh, Geeta Shakya, Haridwar Dubey, Brijlal, B L Varma and Seema Dwivedi; Samajwadi Party’s Ram Gopal Yadav; and BSP’s Ramji Gautam.The term of the newly elected members will be from November 25, 2020 to November 24, 2026.High drama was witnessed on the last day of filing of nomination papers on Tuesday with Samajwadi Party- supported independent candidate Prakash Bajaj entering the fray minutes before the deadline.His papers were, however, rejected during scrutiny, but not before four signatories of the BSP candidate Ramji Gautam’s nomination papers claimed that their signatures were forged and gave an affidavit to the Returning Officer in this regard.Acting tough, BSP president Mayawati suspended these four and three others who had allegedly met Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav after coming out in the open against the party leadership.There are 31 Rajya Sabha seats from Uttar Pradesh of which 22 will now be with the BJP, five with the Samajwadi Party and three with the BSP. The Congress will have only one seat.In Uttarakhand, senior BJP leader Naresh Bansal was declared elected unopposed to Rajya Sabha.Bansal’s election was a mere formality as there was no challenger with the BJP having 57 out of the total 70 seats.Bansal replaces Congress’ Raj Babbar whose tenure in Rajya Sabha ends on November 25. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nda-consolidates-position-in-rajya-sabha-cong-drops-to-lowest-ever-tally-164963

The journey would be subject to an undertaking to be provided by individual passengers to abide by all protocols framed by the Government of India,” a statement by the Embassy said.Besides the 19 Indians who tested positive, antibodies were found in the tests of 39 others, officials said.All the Indian passengers needed to undergo two coronavirus tests before being permitted to board the flights.The passengers who tested positive were shifted to hospitals, Indian officials said. They, however, were not able to provide information about 39 others whose tests reported antibodies and whether they were also referred to hospitals.As per the protocols circulated by Chinese officials, all those who tested positive will be referred to hospitals and will be released only after they test negative.Protocols also stipulate 14-day mandatory quarantine in the designated hotels for all those arriving in China.The flight to Wuhan also carried the largest number of Indian passengers from Delhi compared to the previous VBM flights.There is a big rush for VBM flights from India to China as Beijing has recently lifted the temporary ban on holders of resident permit visas. About 1,500 to 2,000 Indians who are either working in China or connected to businesses want to return.Earlier, India operated three flights to Wuhan to airlift Indians stranded in the city when the virus was at its peak in the Chinese city in February this year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/19-indians-test-covid-19-positive-in-vande-bharat-flight-to-wuhan-164961

02-11-2020||London||Nirav Modi extradition case to enter final stages in UK court||The extradition case of fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering, is expected to enter its final stages at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London on Tuesday.The 49-year-old jeweller, fighting extradition in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, will appear via videolink from Wandsworth Prison in south-west London for the latest hearing in the case, during which District Judge Samuel Goozee will hear his defence team's arguments against the admissibility of certain evidence provided by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) in order to establish a prima facie case against the accused.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, will stress that the evidence meets the required criteria for the UK court to determine whether Modi has a case to answer before the Indian judicial system.The jeweller is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of "Letters of Understanding" (LOUs or loan agreements), and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.He also faces two additional charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death” added to the CBI case.Tuesday's hearing follows two separate sets of hearings in the extradition case being presided over by Justice Goozee, the first in May and then in September, during which the CPS sought to establish Modi's fraudulent actions and played videos in court in support of the additional charges.Assurances of adequate prison conditions were also provided by the Indian government, including further commitments of appropriate mental health care for Modi on being extradited.The defence team, on the other hand, sought to not only establish that Modi's actions related to PNB-issued LoUs did not amount to fraud but also deposed witnesses to highlight his severe depression and deteriorating mental health behind bars. These were further ramped up at a bail hearing last week, when the court was urged to allow Modi to be shifted to a specialist facility under strict bail conditions.However, Judge Goozee turned down the plea, reiterating the concerns from six previous bail attempts that Modi remains a flight risk who would abscond or interfere with the case if granted bail.After this week's hearing to determine the admissibility of the evidence provided by the Indian authorities, it has been indicated that the case would move to a final hearing for the judge to hear the closing submissions in the case from both sides, either next month or early next year depending on the outcome of Tuesday's hearing.A ruling by the District Judge, which would determine whether the case can be sent to UK Home Secretary Priti Patel to order Modi's extradition to India, is expected by next year, a few weeks after the final hearing.Modi, meanwhile, remains in prison since he was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard. The charges against the diamond merchant centre around his firms Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds making fraudulent use of a credit facility offered by PNB or LoUs.The CPS, on behalf of India, have told the court that a number of PNB staff conspired with Modi to ensure the LoUs were issued to his companies without ensuring they were subject to the required credit check, without recording the issuance of the LoUs and without charging the required commission upon the transactions.Modi's team has sought to counter allegations of fraud by deposing witnesses to establish the volatility of the gems and jewellery trade and that the LoUs were standard practice. His family history of suicide and severe depression have also been raised as part of the arguments against extradition, which would make prison conditions at Barrack 12 in Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail inadequate for Modi's pre-trial incarceration in India.

The opening started in a phased manner with the schools welcoming the students of Class 10 and 12 on Monday.A TSRTC official said that Telangana and Andhra Pradesh had mutually agreed upon routes for buses and other modalities and later signed an MoU so that people did not continue to face hardship.Buses and trains are the main source of commute between places across the two states. Bus services between the states were suspended in March due to the nationwide lockdown in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic."Bus services began as both the corporations (TSRTC and APSRTC) signed the MoU," the official said.As per the MoU, TSRTC will ply 1.61 lakh km in AP with 826 buses, while Andhra Pradesh will run almost the same length with 638 vehicles in its neighbouring state, read a press release from the TSRTC.Meanwhile, the AP Government has scheduled the schools to be held from 9.15 am to 1.45 pm, followed by midday meals. A maximum of 16 students are allowed in a classroom. Students were made to sit with wide spacing between them, leaving many benches vacant. As per an official statement from the Education Department, all COVID-19 protocols would be followed that include thermal scanning at the school entrance.The 2020-21 academic year has been extended to April 30 to ensure 180 working days.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-ap-resume-bus-service-after-lockdown-eases-164948

However, what has to be noted is that the entire case of contempt arises out of the letter dated 06.10.2020 written by the Chief Minister directly to the Chief Justice of India and the subsequent press conference held by Sh. Kellam. The Chief Justice of India is seized of the matter. Hence, it would not be appropriate for me to deal with the matter.”Justice Ramana – the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court—is likely to succeed Justice Bobde as the next CJI in April 2021.Last month, a PIL was also filed in the Supreme Court demanding action against him for his anti-judiciary utterances.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ag-declines-consent-for-criminal-contempt-against-andhra-cm-aide-164946
02-11-2020||New Delhi||Temperatures drop below normal in many parts of northwest India||With temperatures dropping below normal over many parts of Northwest, bringing a sudden nip in the air, meteorologists are suspecting a “harsher/colder and an extended winter” this season due to various reasons-local/regional apart from prevailing La Nina conditions. The national capital recorded a minimum temperature of 10.8 degree Celsius on Monday, the lowest this season so far. Normally in the first week of November the Safdarjung Observatory records a minimum of 14 to 16 degrees CelsiusThe mercury dips to 11-12 degrees Celsius by the last week of November, according to IMD officials. In fact IMD says that  temperatures remained “appreciably below normal (-3.1°C to - 5.0°C) at places over Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan and Muzaffarabad and below normal (-1.6°C to -3.0°C) over West Uttar Pradesh, East Rajasthan, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi in the past 24 hours with Hisar recording the lowest minimum temperature of 8.9 degree Celsius. As per Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, November 1 was the coldest in past 10 years in the Capital and that similar conditions are also prevailing in adjoining regions. Predicting a “harsher and extended winter this season” he says there are three main reasons for early drop in the temperatures this year. They include dry weather, lesser/weaker Western Disturbances and clear skies.  Generally clouds trap outgoing infrared radiation, radiating it back downward and warming the ground. “There has not been much snowfall in the hills as most of the WDs have been feeble. Around Diwali a strong WD is expected to bring snow to hills, which will result in a drop in temperatures. Also this is a La Nina year and La Nina conditions coincide with extended winter,” says Palawat   IMD Director General Mrityunjaya Mohapatra adds that “generally during a La Nina year temperatures remain low but a lot also depends upon regional factors, winds, etc. The IMD will be issuing a detailed weather forecast for the season later this month,” he says.El Nino and La Nina conditions play important role in not just the June-September Southwest Monsoon season but weather conditions in other months of the year. La Nina conditions are considered favourable for cold wave condition while El Nino conditions are unfavourable for it, meteorologists say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/temperatures-drop-below-normal-in-many-parts-of-northwest-india-164941

Once we determine the nature of the waitlist—for how many days is the waitlist and how long—we will run clone trains on those routes.“We have been saying that we will introduce trains wherever necessary, but they will be only reserved trains and will follow all coronavirus protocols,” said Railway Board Chairman and CEO V K Yadav at a press briefing on Monday.The Railways, which had suspended all passenger train services since the lockdown in March, has so far earned Rs 3,322 crore as revenue from the segment, which is 90 per cent less than what it earned during the same period last year, Yadav said.Other than the 736 special trains being operated, the Railways is also running 200 services of the Kolkata Metro, 2,276 Mumbai suburban services, 20 special clone trains and 436 festival special trains from October 20 to November 30.Yadav said while the overall occupancy of the 736 trains is around 92 per cent, 19 trains have occupancy below 30 per cent, 44 have occupancy between 30 per cent and 50 per cent, 83 trains have occupancy between 50 per cent and 75 per cent and 327 trains have waitisting.Yadav also said besides Mumbai, the Railways is geared to begin suburban services in other cities. Discussions are underway with the West Bengal and the Tamil Nadu governments in finalising modalities for the resumption of suburban services there, he said.While passenger trains have all but stalled, the Railways’ freight business seems to be speeding forward with incremental loading of over 14.32 metric tonne over October 2019. In October this year, the freight revenue was Rs 869 crore more than last year and it also saw the highest ever automobile loading.While 320 rakes of automotives were loaded in October 2020, as many as 162 were loaded in 2019, which is around a 97.5 per cent increase. Overall this year, the cumulative automobile loading surpassed last year with 1,156 rakes as compared to 886 rakes till October 2020 which is a 30.5 per cent increase. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/surge-in-demand-for-rail-travel-out-of-736-special-trains-327-have-waitlisted-passengers-164937
02-11-2020||New Delhi||Cong targets govt over farm laws, airport lease||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday targeted the government over the new farm laws, alleging the farmers who are demanding more markets have been given recession instead.Gandhi cited a media report to say that the farmers in Bihar want more ‘mandis’ (markets) in the state to sell their produce, like in Punjab and Haryana.His remarks came on the eve of the second phase of polling in Bihar assembly elections.“Farmers of the country asked for a market, the PM gave them recession instead,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.Citing the report, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh alleged that the new farm laws brought in “farm deform” and not reform.“This is exactly what was pointed out in Parliament.“The abolition of the APMC Act in Bihar in 2006 has not benefited farmers. And now the Modi Sarkar has replicated it all over the country. This is not farm reform, but really farm deform,” Ramesh said.Rahul Gandhi also took a swipe at the government, citing reports of Adani group taking over the maintenance of Lucknow and Mangaluru airports, and accused it of “favouring a few friends”.“Development is taking place, but only of a few capitalist ‘friends’,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also targeted the government over the issue, accusing it of supporting crony capitalists.“BJP’s Diwali gift to people: unprecedented inflation. BJP’s Diwali gift to their capitalist friends: 6 airports. With the capitalists and ensuring progress of capitalists,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.She quoted a news report about the handing over of Lucknow airport into private hands. The Adani group has won the bid for the development and maintenance of Lucknow and Mangaluru airports.In another tweet, she criticised the government over the rise in prices of onion and potato, even as she alleged that farmers are not getting remunerative prices for growing them.“Potato prices have risen by almost 100 per cent and that of onions by 50 per cent in the past year.“While the public is suffering due to rising prices of vegetables, the farmers who grow them are not getting their remunerative prices and debt burden on them is rising,” she said in another tweet in Hindi. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-targets-govt-over-farm-laws-airport-lease-164931
02-11-2020||New Delhi||Onion costliest at Rs 100 a kg in Bengaluru; lowest at Rs 35/kg in just 2 cities||Onion, a politically-sensitive commodity, remained costliest in the retail markets of Bengaluru at Rs 100 per kg on Monday despite Karnataka being the third-largest producer of the kitchen staple in the country, according to government data.The lowest price quoted was Rs 35/kg in only two cities—Udaipur in Rajasthan and Rampurhat in Birbhum district of West Bengal—out of the 114 cities where price trends are monitored on a daily basis by the government.The average all-India daily price of onion was ruling as high as Rs 70/kg on Monday.Consumers even in the growing regions are paying elevated rates for the key kitchen item.Despite Maharashtra being the top onion producing state in the country, retail price of the commodity in Mumbai was a hefty Rs 77/kg.A similar situation prevailed in Delhi, one of the major consuming markets, where retail prices were firm at Rs 65 per kg, in Kolkata at Rs 70 per kg and Chennai at Rs 72 per kg on Monday, as per the government data.Retail prices maintained by the government are normally lower by Rs 10-20 per kg than the trade data as prices differ depending on the quality and locality.Onion prices have soared for the last few weeks due to tight supplies following damage to this year’s kharif crop in the wake of heavy rainfall in the key growing states of Maharashtra and Karnataka.However, the government has taken several measures, including banning exports and imposition of stock limits on traders, to boost the domestic supply and keep the prices under check till the arrival of fresh crop by end of this month.The government is also increasing domestic availability by releasing buffer stock of onion as well as relaxing norms for imports via private trade till December.Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka are the top three onion growing states in India. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/onion-costliest-at-rs-100-a-kg-in-bengaluru-lowest-at-rs-35-kg-in-just-2-cities-164929
02-11-2020||Lucknow||Former Congress MP Annu Tandon joins SP||Former Unnao MP Annu Tandon on Monday joined Samajwadi Party within days of quitting the Congress, expressing dissatisfaction with the functioning of its Uttar Pradesh unit.Tandon joined the Samajwadi Party along with Ankit Parihar, a secretary of the state’s Congress unit along with 150 party workers in a small function at the SP headquarters in presence of Akhilesh Yadav.Speaking on the occasion, Yadav defended his party alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party before the 2019 general elections on the ground of a need to stop “communal forces” from coming to power.He also rejected BSP chief Mayawati’s assertion earlier during the day that her party was not going to have any alliance with the BJP.“People know better,” said Akhilesh Yadav, seeking to reject Mayawati’s denial of any move by her party to have an alliance with the BJP, speculation triggered by her earlier statement that she would defeat SP candidates in the Rajya Sabha polls even if that meant having to go along with the BJP.Defending his party’s alliance with the BSP in 2019, Yadav said, “The alliance with the BSP was necessary to stop the BJP. We are not against anyone, but unless we add people, how can we defeat the BJP?”The SP chief also hinted at the BSP veering off its core ideology as the reason for Mayawati’s alleged move to have an association with the BJP.“I am of the opinion that Dr Ram Manohar Lohia and Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar’s ideologies are like two wheels of a cycle and that is why alliance (with BSP) was formed,” he said.Terming the assembly bypolls on seven seats in the state as a “litmus test”, Yadav said the “people of the state have made up their mind against the BJP which has harmed people of both the Dalit and backward communities as well as those of upper and other classes.He also accused the state government of “misusing the official machinery in the state assembly bypolls, asserting that despite that the “BJP is going to taste defeat”.He said his party was trying to “save” the state and its people are “waiting for the time to teach the BJP a lesson”.The SP chief also alleged that actions against his party leaders Azam Khan and Munnawar Rana were taken on directions of the government.Speaking on the occasion, Annu Tandon praised Akhilesh Yadav and termed him as a “young, progressive and visionary leader having all the qualities, which are expected in a leader”.“I had been working with Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and got their support. But the situation changed after 2019,” she said.Asked if she was not satisfied with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Tandon said, “I did not get a chance to work with her. But the UP Congress is has turned worthless.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-congress-mp-annu-tandon-joins-sp-164926

02-11-2020||Patna||Manjhi seeks judicial probe into Paswan’s death, Chirag smells ‘plot’ by Nitish||NDA ally HAM created a flutter on Monday with its leader Jitan Ram Manjhi demanding a judicial inquiry into the death of union minister Ram Vilas Paswan while pointing an accusing finger at Chirag Paswan, prompting the LJP chief to claim it was a “plot” by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to discredit him when election was under way.Chirag Paswan, in an angry retort to Manjhi, said the former chief minister should ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the issue. Paswan jr. said Modi used to call him up every day to inquire after his late father when he was sick and hospitalised, sometimes to even inform him about the LJP founder’s condition after talking to doctors attending to him.“I request the prime minister to order a judicial probe into the death of Ram Vilas Paswan to unravel the dubious role of Chirag Paswan in the matter,” Manjhi said.HAM spokesman Danish Rizwan also wrote a letter to Modi backing the demand while citing a video of Chirag rehearsing before issuing a video message a day after the death of his father where he was purportedly seen joking with the people present and even talking about the texture of his hair.Chirag Paswan accused Nitish Kumar of “scripting a plot to settle political scores with him” and instigating the HAM to rake up an emotional issue to blunt the LJP’s campaign to prevent him from becoming the chief minister once again.Manjhi wanted to know who ordered the hospital to not issue regular health bulletins of Paswan, who was “such a big leader”. Manjhi also claimed people were prevented from meeting the Dalit leader when he was hospitalised.Chirag Paswan had informed people about the death of his father through a tweet on October 8.Manjhi claimed it was being speculated that the LJP leader had died 2-3 days ago.“When he had telephoned me when my father was in hospital, I told him everything. He neither called me again nor visited Papa in the hospital,” Chirag Paswan told a press conference.Ever since his return to the NDA, facilitated by Kumar, Manjhi and his party have been routinely targeting the LJP, which has walked out of the ruling alliance in Bihar and is going solo at the hustings. Chirag has also frequently launched vicious attacks on the chief minister.Both the HAM and the LJP draw strength from Dalit voters, and Manjhi was not on good terms with Ram Vilas Paswan when the two were partners in the NDA in the 2015 assembly election.“Kumar, who is now showing concern about my father’s death, never telephoned me to know about his health leave alone visiting him in the hospital,” the LJP president said.“On the other hand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was kind enough and used to telephone me almost twice a day to inquire about Papa’s health and sometimes even tell me what the doctors are saying about his medical condition.”He recalled Modi had told his first rally of the election in Sasaram that Paswan stood with him till his last breath.“Indeed he (Modi) was the only person who was sincerely bothered about him till he breathed his last,” the 38-year-old LJP chief, who recently declared himself Modi’s Hanuman, said.Flanked by BJP and JD(U) rebels like Rajendra Singh and Bhagwan Singh Kushwaha, he claimed while there were smiles on the faces of LJP candidates after the first phase of polls, Kumar was glum.“Nitish Kumar will be sent packing after November 10,” he asserted.Electorate in 94 assembly seats will vote on Tuesday.Reaffirming that a BJP-LJP government will be formed after the election, Paswan said LJP workers were silently helping BJP candidates in many constituencies and activists of the saffron party were reciprocating the gesture.The LJP has fielded a total of 52 candidates for the second phase of poll on November 3, including 43 seats where JD(U) nominees are in the fray.Paswan appeared to suggest a rift between the JD(U) and the BJP when he said while Nitish Kumar’s party had decided to take forward its ‘Saat Nischay” (seven resolves programme) for public welfare, if voted to power again, the saffron party has promised it will create 19 lakh jobs.“So, whose agenda will be adopted by the future government of the JD(U)-BJP combine?” he wondered.The LJP leader dubbed the 10 lakh government jobs promise by Grand Alliance’s chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav as “lollipop”, and wanted to know why didn’t he accomplish the task when he was the deputy chief minister in 2015-17. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/manjhi-seeks-judicial-probe-into-paswans-death-chirag-smells-plot-by-nitish-164906

We have a family to run too. Does the NDMC think we will continue to work without salaries. We already did for three months without pay in interest of patients,” said Indumati Jamwal, head of the NWA.She said nurses of Kasturba Hospital, Rajen Babu Tuberculosis Hospital and Mrs Girdhari Lal Maternity Hospital have also joined the stir.“About 650 nurses are on strike,” she claimed.“We hope this strike won’t have to continue for long and our issues will be resolved,” Jamwal said, adding that there is a meeting scheduled with North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash on Monday.The members of the Resident Doctors’ Association (RDA) of the 900-bed hospital had been recently protesting for several days and had gone on an indefinite strike, seeking release of salaries due for three months.Seniors doctors under the banner of Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association (MCDA) later had also gone on an indefinite strike, and both associations had called off the stir on October 28.

Besides NCB, the CBI and ED are probing separate cases in connection with the death of the late actor.

02-11-2020||New Delhi||SC asks Centre to file status report on proceedings in UK for extradition of Vijay Mallya||The Supreme Court Monday asked the Centre to file a status report in six weeks on the confidential legal proceedings pending in the United Kingdom on extradition of fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya to India.The Centre had on October 5 told the Apex Court that Mallya could not be extradited to India until a separate “secret” legal process in the UK, which is “judicial and confidential in nature is resolved”.A bench of Justices UU Lalit and Ashok Bhushan asked Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta to file a status report in the matter in six weeks and posted it for hearing in the first week of January next year.The bench also refused to accept the plea of advocate EC Agarwala, appearing for Mallya in the apex court, seeking discharge from the case.The Centre had last month said it was not aware of the secret ongoing proceedings against Mallya in the UK as the government of India was not party to the process.Mallya, an accused in bank loan default case of over Rs 9,000 crore involving his defunct Kingfisher Airlines, is in the UK since March 2016. He is on bail on an extradition warrant executed three years ago by Scotland Yard on April 18, 2017.On August 31, the top court had directed Mallya to appear before it on October 5 while dismissing his plea seeking review of the 2017 verdict, which held him guilty of contempt for transferring $40 million to his children in violations of court orders.During the hearing conducted through video-conferencing on Monday, the Solicitor-General told the bench that Agarwala has filed an application from discharge from the case.“This is aggravating the matter. We have filed an affidavit saying that there are some proceedings going on which is confidential in nature. Without that legal issue being resolved extradition cannot be done,” Mehta said.“The application seeking discharge is rejected and advocate E C Agarwala will continue to appear for the contemnor on the matter,” the bench said in its order.When the bench asked Mehta about time-frame of proceeding pending in the UK, the Solicitor General said they had no information about it from the London High Commission.He sought six-week time to file a status report on the issue.The Ministry of Home Affairs, in its affidavit filed earlier in the contempt case in which Mallya has been held guilty, said the pending legal issue in the UK was “outside and apart from the extradition process” and was “confidential and cannot be disclosed”.The bench had last month asked Mallya’s lawyer to apprise the apex court by November 2, what kind of “secret” proceedings are going on to extradite him.The Centre had given details of the extradition proceedings against Mallya starting from February 9, 2017, till the dismissal of his appeal on May 14 and said that the fugitive businessman had thus exhausted all avenues of appeal in the United Kingdom.The Centre had said following the refusal of leave to appeal, Mallya’s surrender to India should, in principle, had been completed within 28 days but “the UK home office intimated that there is a further legal issue which needs to be resolved before Vijay Mallya’s extradition may take place”.

Due to the protest, trains on the Delhi-Mumbai route have been stopped.The issue was also raised in the Rajasthan Assembly session.As soon as the session began, Deputy Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore sought a reply from the state government on the issue, saying the cabinet sub-committee held talks with Gurjars but members of the community were still blocking railway tracks.Rathore said Internet services were suspended in various districts and rail-road traffic had also been stopped.“The state government should inform the House on the issue,” he said.Speaker CP Joshi then asked the state government to give a reply on it after passing three bills to negate the effect of farms bills passed by the Centre recently.Health Minister Raghu Sharma said the door was always open for holding talks and any problem can be solved through a dialogue.“We have made an agreement and if there are any deficiencies... they can be solved through a meeting. The door is always open for holding talks. The state government provided five per cent reservation which was pending from years,” Sharma told reporters outside the assembly.He said taking the law into one’s hands and damaging property is not a solution to any problem, and added that the people should understand it causes losses to the country.The major Gurjar organisation started the agitation over reservation on Sunday, a day after community leaders held talks with the Rajasthan government and reached a consensus on 14 points.The convenor of the organisation, Colonel Kirori Singh Bainsla, on Sunday asked state Sports and Youth Minister Ashok Chandna to come to Bayana from Jaipur.Later, Chandna reached Hindaun to meet Bainsla and the members of the Samiti but meeting did not take place due to Bainsla’s health and blockade on Hindaun-Peelupura route.“The agitation will affect traffic on the Delhi-Mumbai rail route. The movement of traffic was disrupted on the Bayana-Hindaun road,” police had said.Earlier on Saturday, Gurjar leader Himmat Singh said the talks with the government were positive.Mobile Internet services continue to remain suspended in many districts. The Home Department had evoked the National Security Act (NSA) in Bharatpur, Dholpur, Sawai Madhopur, Dausa, Tonk, Bundi, Jhalawar and Karauli districts.The organisation is demanding that the Rajasthan government should get the Gurjars included in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, fill the backlog of vacancies and give the benefit of five per cent reservation to the Most Backward Classes (MBCs) in the pending recruitment process.The 14 points on which a consensus emerged during the talks on Saturday include providing regular pay scale to 1,252 MBC employees who have completed their probation period.The state government will once again write to the Centre to include the provision related to reservation for the MBCs in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution.

02-11-2020||New Delhi||SC stays EC order directing Kamal Nath's removal as 'star campaigner' for violating model code of conduct||The Supreme Court on Monday stayed the Election Commission’s decision to revoke the “star campaigner” status of senior Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath for allegedly violating the model code of conduct during an assembly by-election campaign in the state."Who gives you the power to determine who is the leader of the party. We stay this order. You have no such power...," a Bench headed by CJI SA Bobde told the Commission while staying its October 30 order.While a political party pays for the expenditure of its star campaigners, individual candidates pay for the expenditure of other campaigners.On behalf of the EC, senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi submitted that the matter had become infructuous because the election campaign was already over.However, the Bench chose to issue a notice to the EC."How can the EC determine who will be a leader (campaigner) of the party?" it wondered.Kamal Nath on Saturday moved the Supreme Court against the Election Commission’s decision to revoke his “star campaigner” status for allegedly violating the model code of conduct during by-election campaign for 28 assembly seats in the state.The Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee President had sought quashing of the EC’s October 30 order on the ground that the order was passed without any notice to him just based on a complaint by a BJP leader.Alleging that the order was “completely unreasoned and passed without application of mind”, he had also raised several questions of law regarding fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression.He had urged the court to direct the EC to frame appropriate guidelines for speeches by star campaigners/campaigners, “keeping in mind the right to freedom of speech and expression and concept of democratic elections”.“It is submitted that the impugned order is illegal, arbitrary, unreasoned, passed in complete violation of basic canons of natural justice and in the negation of fair play and therefore, deserves to be quashed. Further, no notice has been issued to the petitioner (Kamal Nath) with regard to the impugned order in complete violation of principles of natural injustice,” his petition read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-stays-ec-order-directing-kamal-naths-removal-as-star-campaigner-for-violating-model-code-of-conduct-164882

These kind of conditions are imposed which are against the principle of law. Repeatedly such observations are being made,” Parikh had submitted on behalf of the petitioner woman lawyers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-hc-bail-order-that-trivialised-sexual-offence-against-women-must-be-condemned-ag-to-sc-164877

The BSP cannot contest with the communal party,” she said in a media briefing.“Our ideology is of ‘sarvajan sarva dharma hitay’ (benefit of everyone and all religions)’ and is opposite to the BJP’s ideology,” she said.“The BSP cannot enter into an alliance with those having communal, casteist and capitalist ideology,” she added.Mayawati said she would rather take ‘sanyas’ (retirement) from politics than ally with such parties.“I will fight on all fronts with the communal, casteist and capitalist forces, and not going to bow before anyone,” she added.The BSP leader reiterated that her party would ensure the defeat of the SP’s second candidate in future Uttar Pradesh legislative council polls.“Our party will support the candidate of any party, including the BJP, which is strong to defeat the second candidate of the SP,” she said, adding: “I stand by my earlier statement, which is misused by the SP and the Congress for political gains so that the Muslim community distances itself from the party.”She accused the SP and the Congress of trying to ensure that Muslims did not vote for the BSP in the bypolls to seven assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday, adding that they would not be successful in this endeavour.“Everyone knows that the BSP is a party of an ideology and movement, and I never compromised it even when I formed the government with the BJP,” Mayawati said, adding that she had “sacrificed” her government but never harmed the Muslim community.“There was no Hindu-Muslim riots in my regime. History is witness to it. Under the SP and the Congress governments, there were many Hindu-Muslim riots,” she said.Mayawati underscored that she gave adequate representation to the Muslims when her party was in power, as she also pointed out that the party had given tickets to two candidates from the community in the by-elections.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bsp-bjp-alliance-not-possible-ideologies-opposite-mayawati-164871
02-11-2020||New Delhi||SC asks trial courts to expedite hearing in cases against foreign Tablighi Jamaat members||The Supreme Court Monday asked the trial courts to expedite hearing in the pending cases against foreign Tablighi Jamaat members for alleged visa violations. A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna listed the pleas filed against the blacklisting of foreign members of Tablighi Jamaat for attending the Nizamuddin Markaz congregation in the national capital for further hearing on November 20 and asked the lower courts to expeditiously deal with their cases. Senior lawyer Maneka Guruswamy, appearing for some Jamaat members, said the pleas seeking discharge of eight people are listed before trial courts on November 10.Another senior advocate C U Singh said that revisions have been sought by the authorities in cases where some foreign members of the jamaat have been discharged. The courts should dispose of such petitions expeditiously, the bench observed. "It has become a punishment for them, even after discharge the revision applications are filed, and matters will now be heard... They are not being allowed to go back to their countries," Singh said. The top court had earlier directed the Bihar government to move the Patna High Court to seek transfer of pending criminal cases against 13 foreign Tablighi Jamaat members for alleged visa violations before a trial court for quick disposal, preferably within eight weeks of their transfer.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, had said that he did not have any objection and the trial can be consolidated as done in Delhi where a court at Saket is hearing all such cases.Before this, the Centre had told the Supreme Court that lookout notices issued against some foreigners, who have challenged in the apex court the government's orders blacklisting several citizens of 35 countries for alleged involvement in Tablighi Jamaat activities, have been withdrawn.Mehta said the petitioners who are before the apex court would be "free to leave" India subject to no other pending proceedings, including order passed by the court, requiring their presence.As per the information available, 205 FIRs have been lodged against foreign Tablighi Jamaat members by 11 states and 2,765 such foreigners have been blacklisted so far, the Centre had said in its affidavit.Of these, visas of 2,679 foreigners (including 9 Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders) have been cancelled, it said, adding that the remaining 86 include Nepalese nationals who do not require a visa.

The minimum temperature is expected to drop below 10 degrees Celsius by the weekend as no strong WD is likely in the next 10 days, he said.On Sunday, the city recorded a minimum temperature of 11.4 degrees Celsius.The month of October was the coolest in 58 years in the national capital, according to IMD.   The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius, it said.Normally, Delhi records a mean minimum temperature of 19.1 degrees Celsius in October.   The city recorded a mean minimum temperature of 17.5 degrees Celsius in October 2007, according to IMD.On Thursday, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 12.5 degrees Celsius, the lowest in October in 26 years.The last time Delhi recorded such a low temperature in October was in 1994.The national capital had recorded a minimum of 12.3 degrees Celsius on October 31, 1994, according to IMD data.The city recorded the all-time lowest temperature (9.4 degrees Celsius) on October 31, 1937, Srivastava said.

The BJP leader had defeated Yadav's mother Rabri Devi, a former chief minister, in 2010.The BJP has retained its trust in Satish Kumar, hoping that the giant killer will be able to do a repeat of 2010 when, like this time, JD(U) president and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar was with the NDA.Tejashwi's elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav is trying his luck from Hasanpur in Samastipur district, shifting his base from Mahua in Vaishali.  There were said to be fears in the RJD camp that Tej Pratap's bid to retain Mahua could be challenged by the NDA through his estranged wife Aishwarya as its trump card.She is already taking an active part in the campaign for her father Chandrika Roy in Parsa, which he has represented a number of times and is seeking to retain on a JD(U) ticket this time.All the four assembly segments in the capital city – Patna Sahib, Kumhrar, Bankipur and Digha – are also going to polls in the second phase. All these are held by the BJP.State minister Nand Kishore Yadav is in the fray trying to retain Patna Sahib for a seventh consecutive term. Multiple-term MLA Nitin Nabin faces a challenge in Bankipur from Congress candidate Luv Sinha, who is the son of actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha, a two-time local MP who lost the seat when he entered the fray after quitting the BJP.The BJP has retained as its candidates Arun Sinha and Sanjiv Chaurasia for Kumhrar and Digha respectively.Seven constituencies of Nalanda district, to which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar belongs, also go to polls in the second phase.Barring Hilsa, represented by the RJD's Shakti Singh Yadav, and Bihar Sharif, which two-term MLA  Sunil Kumar retained on a BJP ticket in 2015, all the remaining five were won by the JD(U).The assembly segment named after the district is represented by state minister Shrawan Kumar who is seeking re-election from the seat.The JD(U) has suffered a setback in the reserved Rajgir seat where its sitting MLA Ravi Jyoti, a former police inspector, is now the fray on a Congress ticket.Two other ministers Ram Sevak Singh (JDU) and Rana Randhir Singh (BJP) are trying their luck from Hathua and Madhuban in Gopalganj and East Champaran districts respectively. The ministers are sitting MLAs from the respective seats.Many “bahubalis” or their wives, sons, brothers or other close relatives are also contesting a number of seats.Of the 1,463 candidates in the fray on the 94 seats, nearly 10 per cent (146) are women. Among the 2.85 crore voters, females account for 1.35 crore.Maharajganj has the maximum number of 27 candidates for any constituency while Darauli (04) has the lowest.Among the major parties, the RJD is contesting 56 of the 94 seats while its ally Congress is contesting 24. The CPI and CPI(M), which joined the Grand Alliance recently, are fighting four seats each. Quite a few seats are being contested by the CPI(ML), the Left outfit with the strongest presence in Bihar.BJP candidates are in the fray in 46 of the seats, while another 43 are being contested by those with JD(U) tickets. Mukesh Sahni's VIP, the latest entrant in the NDA, is contesting the remaining five.The LJP is contesting 52 seats, including the two it had won in 2015 contesting as an NDA constituent. The party has fielded one transgender candidate too in this phase.The bid of Raju Tiwari and Raj Kumar Sah to retain Govindganj and Lalganj respectively is being challenged by the BJP.According to the Election Commission, votes will be cast at a total of 41,362 polling stations.

02-11-2020||KV Prasad||Cong-CPM tango  in WB out in open||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 1The decision of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to have an electoral understanding with the Indian National Congress for the 2021 West Bengal Assembly elections brings out in the open the not-so-secret understanding that existed in the state four years ago.Yet, that understanding pursued by the Bengal unit of the party with a tacit approval of party general secretary Sitaram Yechury was frowned upon by the collective CPM leadership on an understanding with the Indian National Congress and splitting the party down the middle with predominant Kerala comrades vociferously opposing any such plan.Now with the polls less than a year away, the CPM central committee on Saturday endorsed the understanding, reconciled as it is the face of double-headed challenge in the form of ruling Trinamool Congress and growing political spread of the BJP.Kerala, which will elect a new assembly around the same time, will be an exception, with the CPM-led Left Democratic Front currently in the government gearing up take on the Congress-led United Democratic Front.Three years ago, CPM comrades from Kerala vetoed any understanding with the Congress, but altering political landscape both in the state and West Bengal dictated a change of strategy. The assessment in West Bengal unit is that in order to check the sharp rise of the BJP, parties opposed to the BJP and Trinamool should join hands. The 2016 Assembly experiment of tacit understanding between the CPM and the Congress did not throw up results on anticipated lines. The combined vote share of the Left parties was around 26 per cent, winning 32 seats, much less than 44 seats the Congress bagged with a vote share of 40 per cent.In fact, ahead of the 2019 general elections, the CPM general secretary came under attack, with comrades from Kerala voting against an alternate draft resolution articulating Yechury’s interpretation that as a classical Marxist, the party will have to arrive at “concrete analysis based on concrete conditions”. As for Kerala, he maintained that voters in the state were discerning to decipher the political compulsions in taking on the Congress in the southern state and adopting a friendly posture in West Bengal.The ongoing Bihar Assembly elections are in a manner a testbed for a broader alliance of parties opposed to the BJP and its allies. Besides West Bengal, a similar exercise will come into play in the Assembly elections in Assam and Tamil Nadu, where the CPM will join parties opposed to the BJP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-cpm-tango-in-wb-out-in-open-164799

The fresh plea, filed by BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay through advocate Ashwani Dubey, assumes significance as there has been a demand by some Hindu groups to reclaim religious places at Mathura and Kashi, which are prohibited under the 1991 law.The provisions not only offend the right to equality and life but also violate the principles of secularism, which is an integral part of the Preamble and the basic structure of the Constitution, it said.

It was 32 per cent on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday, the second highest this season so far.Last year, stubble contribution to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.SAFAR said air quality has not improved much despite improved ventilation due to high stubble-related intrusion and trapping of pollutants during night time due to low wintertime boundary layer height. “However, it has not deteriorated further despite favourable North-North-Westerly boundary level wind direction. The highly favourable conditions for fire-related intrusion in Delhi is expected to continue,” it said. SAFAR predicted better ventilation for the next two days but said the AQI is likely to improve only marginally, depending on farm fires. It is set to deteriorate slightly on November 3, it said. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 370 at 3 pm. The 24-hour average AQI was 367 on Saturday. It was 374 on Friday, 395 on Thursday, 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday and 353 on Monday.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stubble-burning-share-in-delhi-pollution-soars-to-40-164758

A constitutional amendment in 2018 has removed the two-five-year term limit for the President, which would enable Xi to continue in power for life.

The PM addressed rallies in Chhapra, Samastipur, Motihari and Bagaha on the last day of campaigning for Phase II of polling.He lauded women’s contribution in Bihar’s progress. “Political pundits had predicted a low turnout in Phase I ..... The turnout in Phase I shows the NDA is ahead. Women are ensuring NDA’s win,” he claimed.He said voters should remember how people of Uttar Pradesh were treated by “double yuvraj” (Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav).“In Bihar, two yuvrajs are fighting for their political survival... they are not concerned about state’s welfare,” he said. He asked youngsters to remember “jungle raj ki sachai”.Attacking “parivarwaad”, he questioned if “any relative of Nitish Kumar or Narendra Modi has reached the Rajya Sabha”. Mentioning Pakistan’s claim on Pulwama, he said Islamabad’s admission of complicity had “taken masks off” the faces of those in India who never cared for the “sons of Bihar” who lost their lives in the assault, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-mocks-double-yuvraj-164734
