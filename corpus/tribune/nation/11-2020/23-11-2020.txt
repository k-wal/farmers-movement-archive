23-11-2020||New Delhi||Cong raises issue of reported Chinese construction near Doklam||The Congress on Monday asked the government as to what steps it has taken to counter the “Chinese aggression” at the border.Referring to reports claiming that China has built a village and a road within Bhutanese territory near Doklam, Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said the move threatens the Siliguri corridor, which can lead to the isolation of Northeast from the mainland.“The government’s silence is enabling the Chinese aggression,” he alleged.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also tagged a media report in this regard and said, “China’s geopolitical strategy cannot be countered by a PR driven media strategy. This simple fact seems to elude the minds of those running GOI.”Khera said the “silence” of the GOI on developments related to China has been “deafening”.“Why is there no acknowledgment of the fact that we are now caught up in multi-border tension,” he said.The Congress leader said over the past few days, certain satellite images accessed of the Doklam region have raised concerns in the minds of every patriotic Indian.“Did the government have any intelligence report regarding this construction? If yes, what steps have they taken to counter this aggression,” Khera asked.He said satellite images have revealed that the Chinese have built a small village or settlement inside Bhutanese territory and merely 10 km away from the 2017 Doklam clash site. In addition to this road, a 9 km long road has also been built, he said.Noting that the implications of the development are multifaceted, he alleged, “This is the clear failure of the central government to stop the Chinese from undertaking such complex construction work near the disputed site.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-raises-issue-of-reported-chinese-construction-near-doklam-174747

The commission can file FIR and imprison anyone for up to 5 years for causing pollution in Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region) so we have asked it to hold the CMs of Haryana and Punjab liable and accountable and take strict action against them,” she added.According to scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, “Pusa bio-decomposer” solution can turn crop residue into manure in 15 to 20 days and therefore, can prevent stubble burning.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-prepare-policies-to-control-stubble-burning-says-new-air-quality-panel-174737
23-11-2020||New Delhi||Tarun Gogoi was admired and respected for his extraordinary wisdom, vision, ability: Sonia Gandhi||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Monday described former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi as one of the tallest leaders of the party who was admired and respected for his extraordinary wisdom, vision and ability as she condoled the demise of the veteran leader.Gogoi died in Guwahati on Monday while undergoing treatment for post-COVID-19 complications. He was 84.Sending her condolences in a letter to Gaurav Gogoi, the son of Tarun Gogoi, Sonia said the Congress party will always honour his memory.“Shri Tarun Gogoi was one of the tallest leaders of the Congress party, admired and respected for his extraordinary wisdom, vision and ability. With his long years of experience as an MLA, an MP, a Central Minister and Chief Minister of Assam, he was someone to whose unfailingly wise counsel and advice we could always turn to,” the Congress chief said.She said former prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi held Tarun Gogoi in high regard.“For me, his loss is also a deeply personal one—I cannot forget the warmth and care he showed on me on my many visits to Assam. During those visits, I saw how loved he was by all the many communities and people of Assam, how much he had done for them, and for their progress and welfare. No wonder he was Assam’s most universally loved and venerated public figure and the longest-serving chief minister of the state,” Gandhi said.The Congress chief said Gogoi’s life was cut short by the cruel pandemic, but he leaves a precious and lasting legacy in the standards he set and in his immense contribution to national life.“The Congress party will always honour his memory,” she said.Gogoi was the chief minister of Assam from 2001 to 2016, a six-time parliamentarian and Union minister twice.

23-11-2020||New Delhi||Permanent Commission for Women: SC satisfied with implementation of February verdict||The Supreme Court on Monday expressed satisfaction over implementation of its verdict asking the Army to grant permanent commission to all eligible women officers.“It’s a victory of our nation that women aspire to achieve the highest pedestal. It’s a great feeling even for us as judges. This is what makes our life complete,” said Justice Chandrachud who headed the Bench that had on February 17 paved the way for women in command positions in the Army. Justice Chandrachud’s comment came after senior counsel R Balasubramanian told the Bench that 70 per cent of the women officers had got permanent commission after the court's verdict.“Yes...I believe some 450 officers got it,” said Justice Chandrachud, who had noted in his verdict that “the right to equality is a right to rationality”.As Balasubramanian, who represented the Centre, said that one-seventh of the officers did not opt for it, Justice Chandrachud said it could be because many of them qualify for pension. “But that’s the choice of the women officers whether they want it or not...the fact that 70 per cent of them got it shows that they are dedicated servants, fit at this age also, as against the contention raised during hearing,” he noted.Agreeing with the Bench, Balasubramanian termed it path-breaking.Highlighting the laurels achieved by women officers, the Bench had in its February 27 verdict said: “Their track record of service to the nation is beyond reproach. To cast aspersion on their abilities on the ground of gender is an affront not only to their dignity as women but to the dignity of the members of the Indian Army---men and women---who serve as equal citizens in a common mission”.While allowing permanent commission for women, the Bench, however, had said: “Whether a particular candidate should or should not be granted a criteria or command assignment is a matter for the competent authority to consider having regard to all the exigencies of service, performance and organisational requirements”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/permanent-commission-for-women-sc-satisfied-with-implementation-of-february-verdict-174729

The respondent occupies a unique office. He is the PM of India,” the top court had noted.“Why should we grant you liberty for adjournment? You are abusing the process of law. You argue,” the CJI had told Bahadur’s counsel declining his request to adjourn the hearing, noting if his nomination was rightly or wrongly rejected depended on his eligibility.The counsel submitted Bahadur had earlier filed his nomination as an independent candidate and later as a candidate of the Samajwadi Party.

23-11-2020||Guwahati||Tarun Gogoi: Congress stalwart who led Assam from the front||"I am a Congressman and will be so till the last breath of my life," Tarun Gogoi, Assam's former Chief Minister and arguably one of the most popular, had once said. He remained true to his words till the very end.The 84-year old veteran Congressman, who died from post-COVID complications on Monday, was a Nehru-Gandhi family loyalist.He strode like a colossus in the political arena, leading Assam from the front with his sharp intellect and a blunt demeanour.On assuming the reins of Assam for the first time in 2001, the Congress leader had said he was confident of holding office for five years but never imagined his popularity would ensure he occupied the position for three successive terms.Credited with bringing the various militant outfits, including the dreaded ULFA, to the negotiating table, hauling out Assam from the brink of bankruptcy and putting it back on the track of development, Gogoi's three terms in office were marked by many highs and a few lows.During his third stint, however, he had to face dissidence within the party, which finally resulted in the ouster of the Congress from power in the 2016 Assembly elections.The dissent was led by his former blue-eyed protege and powerful politician Himanta Biswa Sarma, who was said to harbour chief ministerial ambitions, but the veteran Congress leader steered past all stumbling blocks and continued to hold office by effecting a reshuffle in the ministry.Shortly thereafter, Sarma resigned from the party and the Assembly, and joined the BJP, taking along nine MLAs who were close to him. This dealt a body blow to both Gogoi and the Assam Congress.Undaunted, the six-time MP stood tall as an opposition leader, raising his voice against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and issues related to the implementation of National Register of Citizens, an exercise that left a large number of people of Assam, particularly Muslims, traumatised.Days before he was diagnosed with COVID-19, Gogoi was actively holding parleys with opposition parties to form a grand alliance to take on the ruling BJP in the next Assembly elections.His characteristic smile and positive approach was writ large on his face when he boarded the ambulance to go to the hospital after testing positive for the infection and had even issued an audio clip from the hospital recently where he pledged to serve all sections of the Assamese society till the very end.Notwithstanding the genial smile, Gogoi, who also served as a Union Minister twice, possessed rare political acumen and came across as a visionary who meant serious business.Barring sporadic incidents of violence, mostly perpetrated by the NDFB(S), and the Bodo-Muslim conflict, Gogoi's third term in office was relatively peaceful.Gogoi took over the reins of Assam for the first time on May 17, 2001 from Asom Gana Parishad and was faced with the onerous task of bringing the state out of the morass of militancy and financial instability caused by a huge debt burden with even government employees not receiving their salaries on time.He had mentioned in his memoir "Turnaround", published in 2016, that he knew "in taking oath and signing the register, my first signature as the Chief Minister, I would be signing a pledge of responsibility. In carrying out my duties, I would be shaping Assam's future".The Congress stalwart's initiatives in this direction paid dividends with the party returning to power for the second consecutive term, albeit with fewer seats, and forming a government in alliance with its coalition partner Bodoland Peoples' Front (BPF).Gogoi's second term as Chief Minister was marked by several highs and lows. The multi-crore North Cachar Hills fund diversion scheme scam left his dispensation red-faced, but he successfully managed to salvage its image by bringing several militant organisations like the ULFA, NDFB (Pro-talk group), DHD, UPDS and others to the negotiating table.Plagued by ill-health during the last year of his second term, Gogoi underwent three complicated heart surgeries – bypass, aortic valve replacement and enlargement of the aorta procedure – at Mumbai's Asian Heart Institute.The feisty leader had to get his pacemaker replaced just a few weeks before he hit the campaign trail for the 2011 Assembly polls. None of that deterred him from carrying out his responsibilities.During the 2016 Assembly polls, Gogoi addressed the highest number of public rallies and meetings, without batting an eyelid, despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointing out on several occasions that he (Gogoi) was "too old and must go".A pragmatic politician, who took both achievements and failure in his stride, had said, "When the history of Assam is penned, my three terms will show up both positives as well as negatives. There will be bouquets and brickbats, criticism and acclaim. But I will leave history to judge these years. I, as a son of the soil, am only content and gratified that I could take centrestage in the turn-around story."Although he enjoyed the confidence of UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Gogoi's journey to the state's top post was scripted with great perseverance.Born in the sylvan surroundings of the Rangajan Tea Estate to doctor Kamleswar Gogoi and his wife Usha Gogoi on April 1, 1936, in Upper Assam's Jorhat district, Gogoi had an idyllic childhood playing on the sprawling estate with his five siblings.Gogoi's penchant for politics took roots early in life and though his father had wanted him to study medicine or engineering, he had set his heart on politics, even once announcing to one of his teachers that he wanted to become the Prime Minister when he grew up."It is true that I got ingrained in the Congress ideology as I grew up, but my basic objective has been to serve the people of Assam and the country. Yes, I have chosen politics as the medium to achieve my primary objective," he had once said.Highly impressed with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who visited Jorhat in 1952, Gogoi, then a student of Class 10, began taking part in various political activities, and much to the annoyance of his father and teachers, failed to clear his High School Leaving examination that year. He managed to get a decent score the next year as a private candidate.After leaving school, he joined the Jagannath Barooah College where he plunged into student politics, and following his graduation, joined the Allahabad University to pursue a law degree. He, however, fell ill and returned to Assam to pursue his law degree from Gauhati University.Gogoi, an active leader of the Assam unit of Bharat Yuvak Samaj, joined the Congress in 1963 and since then had been a party loyalist, pledging his support to Indira Gandhi, her son Rajiv Gandhi and then Sonia Gandhi.He also served the party as AICC general secretary and joint secretary in the 1980s, and headed the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee twice from 1986-90 and again from 1996 to 2001.His foray into electoral politics began when he won civic polls and was appointed a member of the Jorhat Municipal Board in 1968. Subsequently, in 1971, he was elected to the Lok Sabha for the first time from the Jorhat parliamentary constituency.An ardent sports lover, Gogoi played golf regularly, though he regretted not getting enough time to pursue his hobby as often as he would have liked. He keenly followed cricket, football and tennis. He was also fond of reading, gardening, and enjoyed shopping for his clothes and accessories.Affable and easily accessible, Gogoi's jovial side came to the fore when he took part in festivals and played drum at Bihu pandals. On one particular occasion, he won many hearts as he played the drum while Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal hummed a song.He was often seen obliging people with selfies at public events.An out-and-out family man, Gogoi married Dolly, a post graduate in zoology from Gauhati University, in 1972.They have two children – daughter Chandrima, an MBA who lives abroad with her family, and son Gaurav, who represents the Kaliabor constituency and is currently the deputy leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha.

23-11-2020||Kolkata||Pangolin headed for Chinese wet market rescued in West Bengal||The COVID-19 pandemic and its catastrophic consequences have failed to douse the Chinese appetite for pangolin.A pangolin, which would have in all likelihood ended in the notorious wet markets of China where exotic animals including pangolins are sold for consumption, was on Sunday rescued by the personnel of the 34th Battalion of SSB and West Bengal Forest Department near Chilakhana in Cooch Behar district of West Bengal.One person was arrested in this connection and a motorbike used for transporting the creature has been confiscated, official sources here said.A number of studies have suggested that pangolin---the only scaled mammal found in the world---may have played a key role in passing the novel coronavirus to humans.“That scaly, anteater-like animals called pangolins are the missing link for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between bats and humans,” a recent paper published by American Chemical Society researchers said.A wet market in Wuhan in China, having a section for live and slaughtered wild animals, is stated to be the source of COVID-19.Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) had provided the intelligence on the basis of which the SSB and WB Forest Department acted and netted the pangolin trafficker near Cooch Behar on Sunday. WCCB officials said while flesh of pangolin is considered a delicacy in China, its scales are also used for traditional Chinese medicines.Pangolin is a schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act, like the tiger, and international trade in their parts is banned under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) treaty. They were reclassified from Appendix II to I in the CITES sometime back.Close to 6,000 pangolins have been trafficked from India to China and Southeast Asia between 2009 and 2017, says a report of TRAFFIC (The Wildlife Trade Monitoring Network) India.According WCCB officials, pangolins from India are smuggled first to Myanmar through the Indo-Myanmar border in north-east, and from there it travels to China.The reopening of the Chinese wet markets has given rise to fresh demand for pangolin in China, the sources said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pangolin-headed-for-chinese-wet-market-rescued-in-west-bengal-174720

But this will be applicable in areas outside the containment zones. Issuing the order on Monday, state Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar cited the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) orders on the same. The MHA orders say management of cinemas, theatres and multiplexes should ensure that all persons including the audience, staff, vendors etc., use masks at all times. It is the duty of the managements to ensure hand sanitizers at entry/exit points and common areas; following physical distancing and crowd management measures; ensure sanitisation of entire premises particularly common areas after every screening; and that temperature setting of all air conditioning devices be set in the range of 24-30 degree Celsius. The state government has further asked the managements of the multiplexes to ensure that the relative humidity should be maintained in the range of 40-70 per cent and that re-circulation of air should be avoided and intake of fresh air should be as much as possible. It may be recalled that a delegation of the Telugu film industry had met Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) at his residence on Sunday and the chief minister had promised to work towards easing their problems. The Telugu film industry is estimated to have an annual turnover of Rs 1,200 crore and averages between 150 to 200 films every year.

23-11-2020||---||Intrigue hots up on the ‘roof of the world’||New Delhi, November 23The Great Game on the Roof of the World is beginning to get intriguing as existing players have begun jettisoning over half a century of status quo. World attention is currently focused on the China-India face off in eastern Ladakh, but intrigues relating to Tibet and the surrounding territories controlled by India, Nepal and Bhutan are making a comeback.   China has ingressed into Bhutanese territory by building a road in an area that India considers a security risk to the Chicken’s Neck corridor connecting the mainland to the North East, said sources here. So far, there was reasoned speculation about the Chinese building a village as well as a road towards Jampheri Ridge.Reports of a similar nature have come from Nepal but have been denied as well. However, China is now attempting to put in place an all-weather link to Nepal that will serve as a more reliable avenue for commerce.The movement by Chinese troops came even as Beijing has been sending feelers to Thimphu to settle their borders. In 2017, Indian troops had blocked a similar movement with New Delhi stating that this was done at Bhutan’s behest. Before the Chinese ingress on Doklam plateau was established by satellite images, the Bhutanese envoy here was denying there had been any Chinese ingress.In the US, the House of Representatives will follow up a bipartisan unanimous resolution of Tibet with a major event such as a Joint Meeting of the Congress or even a scaled down version such as a roundtable with the Dalai Lama via video conferencing to discuss the peaceful resolution of the Tibet issue.The head of the Tibetan government in exile has visited the White House for the first time in six decades, a move that could further infuriate China, which has accused the US of trying to destabilise the region.Last week, another taboo was broken when Lobsang Sangay, “President of the Central Tibetan administration (CTA)”, visited a wing of the White House to meet a newly appointed interlocutor on Tibetan affairs. The CTA highlighted the takeaway from “this unprecedented meeting’’ which would be more formalised interaction with US officials in the coming years.In India, Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu has repeated his statement that the state does not share a direct border with China but with Tibet.

23-11-2020||New Delhi||Energy can be next frontier of India-Israel ties: Diplomat||Energy could be the next frontier of India-Israel relations, said a senior Indian diplomat here on Monday.Contracts for gas exports from the massive Israeli reserves in the eastern Mediterranean, exploring oil and gas in reserves in India, developing technologies and collaborations for renewable energy sources could be the way forward, said MEA Secretary (CPV&OIA) Sanjay Bhattacharyya, at the 13th India-Israel Forum, a Track II dialogue forum that was also addressed by Alon Ushpiz, former Ambassador of Israel to India and currently Director General of Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.In an era where technology dominates, India-Israel projects can lead the way in securing new markets globally by leveraging their high-tech collaboration in defence, under Make in India, and cooperation to combat cyber crimes.Bhattacharya also lauded the Israeli technology in water conservation and desalination which is being utilized here to bring water to Jamnagar, Chennai and Bundelkhand, to revive traditional indigenous water practices in the region and encourage new agricultural methods based on technology.Bhattacharya also suggested that partnership in climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts will be of immense benefit to both societies.“With the West Asia and Gulf region, we seek to supplement our strong traditional ties with an ‘ahead of the curve’ approach, which embraces technology and national priorities in a future-oriented action plan that not only strengthens relations but also refashions them and makes them relevant to the changing times,” he said.The senior diplomat pointed out that the recent rapprochement between Arab states and Israel leading to the normalisation of relations as it could improve the region’s prospects.“We have often said that direct negotiations between the parties can provide solutions for peaceful and secure co-existence between the two sides and also provide peace and prosperity to the citizens of two states, living side by side.”India, he said, had maintained a principled policy of non-interference and non-partisanship, advised peaceful negotiated settlement and maintained relations with all the countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/energy-can-be-next-frontier-of-india-israel-ties-diplomat-174700

23-11-2020||New Delhi||Former Spl Metropolitan Magistrate gets 5-year jail in bribery case||A Delhi court has awarded a 5-year jail term to a former special metropolitan magistrate in a bribery case, saying that people will lose faith in the justice delivery system if adequate punishment was not given to him.Accused R P Bhatia, 70, worked as a special metropolitan magistrate (littering), central zone, while committing the offence in 2015.On August 18, 2015, the CBI had laid a trap on the complaint of a shop owner and caught Bhatia taking bribe and recovered Rs 25,000 from a bag kept inside his chamber adjoining the courtroom.“At the time of commission of offence, convict was discharging judicial functions while sitting on the dais in the Court room. He was 65 years old at the time of commission of offence.“Considering the nature of the office convict was holding, people will lose faith in the justice delivery system if adequate punishment is not awarded,” Special CBI judge Santosh Snehi Mann noted.The judge said the convict was a mature person and had served in “an elite government institution like Planning Commission of India in the past,” and a high moral conduct was expected of him.“Any leniency in the sentence will be an act of misplaced sympathy which will undermine the rule of law in the eyes of a common man,” the court said in its order passed on November 19.In her judgement, the judge highlighted that the prosecution witnesses had been consistent and reliable in their deposition, proving that following a specific demand raised by the accused, tainted money was placed and recovered from his chamber.According to the CBI, the accused had ‘challaned’ the complainant, a shop owner at Alaknanda market in south Delhi, during an inspection on August 10, 2015, and had asked the complainant to appear before his court at Lajpat Nagar. When the complainant reached the court, the magistrate demanded Rs 60,000 for settling the case. The complainant negotiated the amount and settled for Rs 25,000.The accused had claimed innocence and said he was framed as the shopkeepers of the area wanted to prevent him from carrying out his duties. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-spl-metropolitan-magistrate-gets-5-year-jail-in-bribery-case-174693

23-11-2020||Mumbai||Kangana moves HC to quash Mumbai police’s FIR against her||Actress Kangana Ranaut and her sister Rangoli Chandel filed a petition in the Bombay High Court on Monday, seeking to quash an FIR registered against them by Mumbai Police for allegedly “trying to create hatred and communal tension” through their posts on social media.The FIR, under sedition charges, was registered pursuant to orders passed by the Bandra magistrate’s court directing the police to carry out an inquiry against Ranaut and her sister following a complaint lodged against them.“Kangana and Rangoli have filed a petition in the Bombay High Court for quashing of the FIR and the magistrate’s order,” their advocate Rizwan Siddiquee told PTI.He said the petition has also sought the court to stay the summons issued against the duo asking them to appear before the police for questioning, and also a direction to the police to not take any coercive steps against them.Mumbai police last week summoned Ranaut and her sister for the third time to record their statements on November 23 and 24.The police have filed the FIR against Ranaut and her sister under IPC sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race), 295-A (deliberate acts hurting religious sentiments) and 124-A (sedition), 34 (common intention).Magistrate Jaydeo Ghule, on October 17, passed the order directing the police to conduct an inquiry and register FIR on a complaint filed before the court by casting director and fitness trainer Munnawarali Sayyed, seeking action against Ranaut and her sister for their posts on social media.In his complaint, Sayyed pointed out to the court several posts published by Ranuat and her sister on their social media accounts on actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case, an incident of lynching of two seers in Maharashtra’s Palghar district, and a post comparing Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).The complaint said an investigation was required to ascertain the real motive behind such posts that allegedly create hatred and communal tensions.Agreeing with the complaint, the magistrate in his order said: “Prima facie, on perusal of the complaint and submissions, I found a cognisable offence has been committed by the accused persons and a thorough investigation is necessary.”The police on the same day registered an FIR against Ranaut and Rangoli and subsequently issued summons on two occasions asking the sisters to appear before them for recording of their statement.The sisters, however, responded to the summons saying they cannot come to Mumbai as they were in Himachal Pradesh for a wedding function at home.Following this, a third summons was issued last week asking Ranuat to appear before the police on November 23 and Chandel on November 24.

23-11-2020||Mumbai||Sushant death-drug probe: NCB denies man illegally detained||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Monday denied before the Bombay High Court that Dipesh Sawant, late actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s domestic staff, had been illegally detained in a drugs case that it is probing.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, who appeared for the NCB, told a Bench of Justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik that Sawant had been arrested on September 5 following due procedure and that there was nothing illegal about his arrest.ASG Singh was responding to a petition filed by Sawant in October this year claiming he had been arrested illegally by the NCB, and had sought a compensation of Rs 10 lakh.On Monday, Sawant’s counsel, Amir Koradia, told the Bench that contrary to NCB’s claim, Sawant was arrested from his office in the city on September 4.“I should have, therefore, been produced before the magistrate on September 5 but this was done only on September 6,” he said.ASG Singh, however, told the court that the above was not true.“The NCB has an arrest memo signed by him (Sawant) that says he was arrested and brought to the NCB office on September 5. His brother Vivek also accompanied him to the NCB office,” Singh said.“He (Sawant) was allowed to make a phone call to his family after his arrest, and the next morning, he was provided breakfast. How can his arrest be a case of illegal detention then?” Singh said.He also said Sawant was arrested along with several others in a case that involved an active drug syndicate and, therefore, there was no question of quashing his remand.The Bench, however, said that unless an “independent” body or officer conducted an inquiry into the allegations made by Sawant, it would be unable to adjudicate upon the prayers made in the plea.The NCB, however, said Sawant’s allegations were untrue and, therefore, there was no need for any inquiry.The court adjourned the matter for further hearing on December 4.

23-11-2020||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court extends parole of Rajiv killer AG Perarivalan||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 23The Supreme Court on Monday extended by a week the parole to Rajiv Gandhi killer AG Perarivalan who was serving life sentence and asked the Tamil Nadu Government to provide escort to him to enable him to undergo medical tests.A Bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao passed the order after senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan said the Madras High Court had earlier extended the parole from November 9 to November 23.The Bench said it intended to dispose of Perarivalan's plea for remission of sentence on the next date of hearing.On November 3, the Bench had said the investigation into the “larger conspiracy” behind Rajiv Gandhi' assassination need not deter the Governor from deciding clemency plea of Perarivalan, who has been in prison for more than two decades.The CBI told the Supreme Court last week that the Tamil Nadu Governor was the competent authority to take call on his remission plea.In an affidavit filed last week, the CBI said the issue of remission of sentence was solely between Governor Banwarilal Purohit and Perarivalan and it was for the Governor to decide whether to release him. Perarivalan’s mother has applied to the Tamil Nadu Governor for his release.Perarivalan was not needed for further investigation by the Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA) into the “larger conspiracy” behind Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, the CBI said.Gandhi was assassinated on the night of May 21, 1991 at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu by a woman suicide bomber, identified as Dhanu, at a poll rally.In its May 1999 order, the top court had upheld the death sentence of four convicts - Perarivalan, Murugan, Santham and Nalini.In April 2000, the Tamil Nadu governor had commuted the death sentence of Nalini on the basis of the state government's recommendation.On February 18, 2014, it had commuted the death sentence of Perarivalan to life imprisonment, along with that of two other prisoners - Santhan and Murugan - on the grounds of 11-year delay in deciding their mercy pleas by the Centre.As the Tamil Nadu Governor sits over Perarivalan’s clemency plea for over two years, the Supreme Court had on November 3 expressed displeasure over it and asked lawyers in the case to suggest what could be done to break the impasse.“We don't want to exercise our jurisdiction at this stage but we are not happy that a recommendation made by the government is pending for two years,” the Bench had said.The top court had asked petitioner Perarivalan’s counsel if it could exercise its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution to request the Governor to decide his plea for pardon filed under Article 161 which empowers a Governor to grant pardon to a convict in a criminal case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-extends-parole-of-rajiv-killer-ag-perarivalan-174664

Be it the aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign, or economic targets or many other pledges like this, we have to achieve them during this period,” he said.Modi said the new flats for parliamentarians, who often had to wait long for getting a house in the national capital, is among the series of projects completed under his government after being kept pending for years and decades.He referred to the completion of the Ambedkar International Centre, Central Information Commission building and War Memorial in this regard.A PMO statement had earlier said that the construction of these flats has been completed with savings of about 14 per cent from the sanctioned cost and without time overrun despite the impact of COVID-19.

23-11-2020||New Delhi||Facing flak, LDF govt puts on hold controversial Kerala Police Act amendment||Faced with mounting criticism, the CPI(M) and the CPI leaderships on Monday prevailed on their Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala to put on hold implementation of the controversial Kerala Police Law Amendment Ordinance.“In these circumstances, the government of Kerala will not go ahead with implementing the amendment,” Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan stated a couple of hours after central Left leaders Sitaram Yechury (CPI-M) and D Raja (CPI) interceded.Vijayan, in a statement, cited “apprehensions” aired by those who support the LDF and stand for democracy as a reason for not going ahead with the amendment.“A detailed discussion will be held in the Assembly regarding this, and the future course will be decided upon after duly considering the opinions coming upfront from all quarters,” Vijayan said.The amendment vide the Ordinance was to give more powers to police to tackle cyber crimes.It provided for either imprisonment for up to five years, or a fine of up to Rs 10,000, or both to those who publish and produce or purvey content through any means of communication with an intention to insult, intimidate or defame any person through social media platforms.Yechury and Raja had a discussion before conveying their counsel to the government. Yechury had told reporters that the Ordinance will be “reconsidered”.On the other hand, D Raja said: “The state government has to be mindful of the public opinion, which is against the Ordinance”.“The CPI, in principle, is against governments resorting to Ordinances.”Raja further said that the issue of cyber crimes raised in the Ordinance is not confined to one state. A Standing Committee of the Parliament is also seized of the matter.“Hence, the Kerala government must take a holistic view, and the State Legislature must discuss the issue threadbare on issues before framing laws,” Raja said.Sources said the apprehensions that the controversial amendment by LDF government could prompt BJP governments to adopt similar “draconian” measures also had bearing on the Left leaders.A Left leader said one way for the state to get out of the quandary is to let the Ordinance be in limbo, and lapse.As per Constitutional provision, an Ordinance has to be ratified by the state Assembly within six months of its promulgation.The Assembly election in Kerala will take place sometime in April-May next year, which is about six months, which would provide wiggle-room to the government if needed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/facing-flak-ldf-govt-puts-on-hold-controversial-kerala-police-act-amendment-174642

23-11-2020||New Delhi||Cold wave sweeps Delhi; minimum temperature drops to 6.3 degrees Celsius||A cold wave gripped Delhi on Monday as the minimum temperature dropped to 6.3 degrees Celsius, five notches below normal and the lowest in the month of November since 2003, according to the India Meteorological Department.On Sunday, the national capital had recorded a minimum of 6.9 degrees Celsius and a maximum of 24.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest day time temperature so far this month.“The Safdarjung Observatory which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 6.3 degrees Celsius, which is Delhi’s lowest minimum temperature in the month since November 2003, when the city recorded a minimum of 6.1 degrees Celsius,” Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre, said.The mercury dropped to 6.4 degrees Celsius at the Lodhi Road weather station, he said.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days.“However, for small areas such as Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria is fulfilled even for a day,” Srivastava said.Delhi had recorded the lowest minimum temperature of 11.5 degrees Celsius last year, 10.5 degrees Celsius in 2018 and 7.6 degrees Celsius in 2017 in the month of November.The all-time record for the lowest minimum temperature in November is 3.9 degrees Celsius recorded on November 28, 1938.Srivastava said icy cold winds blowing from snow-laden western Himalayas have led to a dip in the mercury.However, the minimum temperature will rise by two to three degrees Celsius in the next four to five days under the influence of a fresh Western Disturbance.          The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degrees Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover, according to IMD officials.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.The month of October was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital.             The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius.

Venus has been explored by flyby, orbiter, a few lander missions and atmospheric probes.“In spite of great progress made in exploring Venus, there still exist gaps in our basic understanding about surface/sub-surface features and processes, super-rotation of the Venusian atmosphere and its evolution and interaction with solar radiation/solar wind,” ISRO had said.The payload capability of the proposed 2500-kg satellite, planned to be launched onboard GSLV Mk II rocket, is likely to be 175 kg with 500W of power.The proposed orbit is expected to be around 500x60,000 km around Venus. This orbit is likely to be reduced gradually, over several months to a lower apoapsis (farthest point).

India is engaged in a consensus-building exercise in the run-up to a decision towards the middle of next month. Faced with opposition from the US, EU and Brazil, the proposal was put off when it was first tabled at WTO, with support from the WHO, on October 2.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-leads-move-to-lower-vaccine-prices-174551

We are reformists speaking for the betterment of the party. We are not against the Congress leadership. Rather we are strengthening the leadership by proposing reforms,” said Azad, days after another letter writer and former minister Kapil Sibal publicly said time for introspection in the Congress was over and now was the time for action.Reacting to the Bihar election loss of the party, Azad blamed the five-star culture, which he said was harming party’s prospects.“Congress leaders at various levels should give up this five-star culture at least during elections. State in charges must tour the field and not be in a hurry to return to their five-star hotels at night when they are managing elections. They should instead go among the people with local leaders,” said Azad.‘No crisis; support for Sonia clear apparent’New Delhi: Amid criticism of the Congress top brass by some leaders following a poor show in the Bihar polls, senior leader Salman Khurshid on Sunday said there was no leadership crisis and an all-round support for Sonia and Rahul Gandhi was “apparent to anyone who is not blind”.

The PGI, Chandigarh, had already administered the second dose of vaccine to 100 volunteers as part of the ongoing phase 3 trials in India, he added. “Early phase trial results from the PGI showed strong safety outcomes in 149 participants who were administered the first dose of Covishield. In the final and third phase of the trial, all participants will be inoculated with the second dose. The second dose has already been given to 100 participants and the trial is nearing completion, after which results on immunogenicity and cell mediated immunity will be generated and analysed for final outcomes,” he said.Easy storageAccording to PGI Director Dr Jagat Ram, unlike the Pfizer vaccine that requires minus 70°C storage structures, Covishield can be stored between 2 and 8°C. Hence Covishield can be transported to rural hinterland to cover rural population as well.To a specific query about why he thought the Oxford University-AstraZeneca-Serum Institute’s Covishield was the most suitable for Indian settings, he said, “Covishield is the most suited for India because it can be easily stored and transported. Unlike the Pfizer vaccine that requires minus 70°C storage structures, Covishield can be stored between 2 to 8°C. Hence Covishield scan be transported to rural hinterland to cover rural populations as well.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oxford-vaccine-most-suitable-for-india-pgi-chief-174519

He said the progress on this front could gain pace if there was greater technological and financial support to the developing world.Narendra Modi, Prime MinisterRespect dignity of every workerFor humanity to prosper, every individual must prosper. Rather than seeing labour as a factor of production alone, the focus must be on human dignity of every worker.Modi said India was not only meeting its Paris Agreement targets, but also exceeding them. "Inspired by our traditional ethos of living in harmony with the environment, and the commitment of my government, India has adopted low-carbon and climate-resilient development practices," he said."For humanity to prosper, every single individual must prosper. Rather than seeing labour as a factor of production alone, the focus must be on human dignity of every worker," he added.US President Donald Trump, however, said the Paris Agreement was "not designed to preserve environment, but to kill American economy".Meanwhile, a draft G-20 statement pledged to pay for a fair distribution of Covid vaccines, drugs and tests so that poorer countries are not left out. It also called for extensive immunisation and asked private creditors to join the debt-servicing moratorium for poor countries.On climate change, the draft statement was similar to PM Modi's observations: "We recover from the pandemic, we are committed to safeguarding our planet and building a more environmentally sustainable and inclusive future for all people."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/integrated-approach-must-to-fight-climate-change-prime-minister-at-g20-174525
