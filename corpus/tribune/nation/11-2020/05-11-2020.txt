05-11-2020||New York||India can be US’ great partner in fighting COVID-19 pandemic: Experts||India can be a “great partner” for the US in combatting the coronavirus pandemic and rebuilding the economy, and the two countries’ relationship is about how they can influence regional and global challenges, leading Indian-American experts have said.Speaking during a virtual post-election political analysis hosted by leading nonprofit Indian diaspora organisation ‘Indiaspora’, former Assistant Secretary of State, South and Central Asia Nisha Biswal said that in the eventuality that Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden becomes the President, he will bring to the relationship a “global scope and a global impact”.“The prime minister of India is looking for a United States that is going to be a leader on the global stage and a partner for India at a very important time,” she said.“A US-India partnership is not just about the United States and India but it’s about how the two, working together, can actually influence regional and global issues and challenges. I think you’ll see that in a much crisper way in a Biden administration,” she said.Biswal emphasised that as the vote tallies across the US come in, “it underscores to me that we are living in a divided country and we’re going to need to figure out how we find some common ground, how we build some bridges and how do we heal some of the wounds that are festering beneath the surface”.    She added that going forward, there will be need for platforms like Indiaspora that bring voices together within South Asian diaspora community.“And I think that we’re going to need to be doing that across the country and our community can be part of that healing and that national conversation as well,” she said.Responding to a question on what Modi’s relationship would be with Biden, if the Democratic presidential candidate becomes the President, Biswal said it will not be a new relationship.Modi has met Biden when he was the vice president on numerous occasions, including on his first visit to the US as the prime minister when the Democratic presidential candidate had hosted a formal ceremonial luncheon in honour of Modi, she said.“So the two of them have a relationship already,” she said.Former US ambassador to India Rich Verma said Biden had been working on the India-US relationship for decades and is familiar with it.“But there’s a lot of things we can do right out of the box. The first obvious one is on global health cooperation, pandemic response, vaccine development and deployment. If that is issue number one, getting people safe but getting our economy going, India can be a great partner in that,” Verma said.On the trade front, he pointed out that the two countries can do a lot.“There was a kind of mini-deal sitting for a while. We ought to just finish that and get that done. On the defense front, I think we can go a lot farther,” he said.He, however, pointed out that there was a need for “some repair work with how stable and trusted we are in the Indo-Pacific”.This would mean rebuilding some of the US alliances and being a more steady partner, he said.Verma underscored that how America treats its diaspora communities, particularly South Asians and Indian-Americans, also makes a big difference to the bilateral relationship.“I’ve spoken out a lot over the last few years about how minority communities get treated here. People think those are domestic issues, but frankly, those are big bilateral issues and they impact the quality of relationships between countries. So we’ve got to get that on track, treat people with respect, make them feel welcome and included. That would be the best thing we can do for US-India relations,” he said.Verma said that in the last three or four years of the Obama administration, the bilateral relations were on a high point. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-can-be-us-great-partner-in-fighting-covid-19-pandemic-experts-166527

Using new technologies to save water and (increase) energy efficiency is also a concern which you are taking care of. You (CEOs) are the captains. This is a CEOs' forum. You will give shape to India's actions,” he said.The CEOs and top managers of companies, including Reliance Industries Ltd, Tech Mahindra, Dalmia Cement, Ambuja Cement, Dr Reddy's, Sun Pharma and Adani Transmission, attended the discussion.Javadekar said that India was among the few countries which was 2 degrees compliant and has taken many decisive actions, in fighting climate change, not only at the government level but even at the private level, which shows our commitment and resolve.India is doing well towards achieving its nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, he added.India is a signatory to the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/javadekar-urges-industry-leaders-to-work-with-government-in-combating-climate-change-166522

Some of them, from countries like Estonia, are at odds with Russia, a close Indian ally, but all are acknowledged leaders in high-end manufacturing and innovation.One minister participated in the conference though he was in home isolation after a Cabinet colleague tested positive for Covid.All ministers offered cooperation in fields their countries excelled in, but SAAB Chairman Marcus Wallenberg injected a note of realism by asking for an EU-India FTA as soon as possible to deepen trade linkages with the Nordic-Baltic region.Jaishankar set out the areas where there is potential for more partnership such as renewable energy and clean technologies, factories of the future, AI and block chain-led transformation, supply chain and logistics and fin-tech.With a greater digital focus, India will also give more attention to its infrastructure as well as data and cyber security.Denmark Foreign Minister Jeppe Sebastian Kofod suggested wind power, water, and infrastructure; Finland FM Ville Skinnari suggested 5G technology, quantum computing and AI; and, Iceland Minister Thordis Gylfadottir highlighted converting greenhouse gases, utilising ocean resources to create nutritional supplements and medicines and gaming technology.Latvian FM Edgars Rinkevics underlined 5G, cyber-security and R&D while Estonian FM Urmas Reinsalu touched on e-health, cyber security and 5-G.The industry from Nordic-Baltic countries has been operating in India for many years. Astra-Zeneca, which was co-headquartered in the region is developing a vaccine for Covid along with the Serum Institute in Pune.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-seeks-high-end-technology-from-baltic-nations-166519

Incidentally, the statement was mocked by not just Opposition but also BJP’s self-appointed “Bihar ally”, LJP’s Chirag Paswan. The BJP called it his personal view, while opponents read it as “admission of defeat”. “Today is the last day of electioneering....Polling for the last phase will be held the day after tomorrow..... And, this is my last election…Aant bhala toh sab bhala’ (all is well that ends well),” Nitish Kumar said asking people to vote in favour of party candidate.Prime Minister Modi, who has invested a lot of time and energy in these elections holding as many as 12 rallies, wrote a letter telling people the Nitish Kumar-led government will ensure that there are no obstructions for development policies in the State.“I am convinced about the development of Bihar. I need Nitish Kumar government to ensure that there are no obstructions for development policies in Bihar,” he said in his four-page letter before the final phase of voting on Saturday.“Only NDA can provide better infrastructure, rule of law imperative for social and economic prosperity in Bihar....I have full faith that the power of ‘double engine’ will take Bihar to new heights of development in this decade,” he said. Nadda, meanwhile, said while America stumbled during coronavirus crisis, PM Modi saved India by taking the right decision at the right time. “The results of the US election are coming…Donald Trump has been cornered by people on the issue of Corona...He stumbled but  PM Modi saved India by taking the right decision at the right time,” Nadda said in one of the rallies in the elections which the BJP is contesting on the name of PM Modi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/curtains-down-on-high-pitch-electioneering-in-bihar-166514

However, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 450, the highest since December 30 last year, when it was 446.All the 36 monitoring stations in Delhi recorded air quality in the 'severe' category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurgaon and Noida also recorded 'severe' air pollution.

It will be followed by one-to-one meetings over the next fortnight with leading CEOs from here and the world.“India has the potential to catalyse global economic resurgence. Any achievement by India will have a multiplier effect on the world’s development. A strong and vibrant India can stabilise world economic order,” he said. The PM had earlier addressed business from the US and Canada at similar virtual interactions.The PM underlined the various economic initiatives underway as also stressed on India’s democratic credentials and its free and open society as if to underline India’s difference with China.Another selling point was that India offered multiple markets within one market which come with multiple levels of development preferences.Addressing “some of the best financial brains who can convert new areas of innovation and growth into sustainable business propositions”, the PM said he was conscious of their requirement of best and safe long-term returns.  Dwelling on the multiple initiatives to improve India’s manufacturing potential, he mentioned the GST, one of the lowest corporate tax rates, a new labour law regime, plans to invest over Rs. 1 trillion under an massive infrastructure building plan and millions for houses for the neo middle class.The PM also spoke on his government’s “holistic” strategy for financial sector reforms in banking, strengthening of markets, a suitable policy regime for investment vehicles, implementation of the insolvency act and digital payment systems.“We have one of the largest number of startups and unicorns in the world. The growth rate in 2019 translates into an average of two to three startups coming up every day,” said the PM to emphasise India’s accent on innovation.There are many openings available due to strategic disinvestment and monetisation on an unprecedented scale spurred by the decision to reduce Government holding in PSUs to below 51 per cent, open up reserved sectors such as coals, civil aviation, defence, space, atomic energy and railways.Each sector is looking up, including manufacturing, infrastructure, technology, agriculture, finance and even social sectors like health and education. The recent agriculture sector reforms have opened up new possibilities of partnering with farmers. This has led to the global investor community showing confidence in India’s future which is reflected in a 30 per cent rise in FDI inflows in the past five months, said the PM.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-assures-foreign-investors-returns-with-reliability-166507
05-11-2020||New Delhi||Domestic flights' cap would be increased to 70-75 pc of pre-COVID levels as traffic surges: Govt||The cap on the number of domestic flights that Indian airlines are permitted to operate would be increased to 70-75 per cent of their pre-COVID levels as the passenger traffic surges, the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MOCA) said on Thursday.The ministry had said last week that the Indian airlines can operate maximum 60 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic passenger flights till February 24 next year due to the prevailing coronavirus situation.In a press release on Thursday, the ministry said, "MOCA is monitoring traffic everyday, and it is expected that the traffic would further pickup because of the festival season and as passenger traffic increases, the upper cap would be revised to 70-75 per cent of normal capacity in the coming days." The MOCA said 2.05 lakh passengers travelled in domestic flights on November 1.The ministry had informed the airlines about the aforementioned 60 per cent limit through an official order on September 2 but it had not told them the period for which the cap would remain in place.Last Thursday, the ministry issued a new order clarifying that the September 2 order "shall remain in force until 2359 hrs on February 24, 2021 or until further orders" due to the "prevailing situation of COVID-19".The ministry had resumed domestic passenger services from May 25, after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. However, the airlines were allowed to operate not more than 33 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights. On June 26, this was increased to 45 per cent and on September 2, it was further increased to 60 per cent.Airlines are expecting that the government would further increase the cap on domestic flights so that they can soon reach their pre-COVID levels.For example, Vistara is expecting to operate 100 per cent of its pre-COVID domestic passenger flights by April next year, said its Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) Vinod Kannan on Wednesday.Currently, Vistara is operating around 55 per cent of its pre-COVID scheduled domestic passenger services.Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in the country since March 23 due to the pandemic.However, special international flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat Mission since May and under bilateral air bubble pacts signed with various countries since July.

Most of the sex workers are starving because of the total loss of their livelihood. As an emergency measure the Andhra Pradesh Government has decided to distribute free ration to save their lives.The initial response to save the sex workers came from the Supreme Court which directed states to help the sex workers whose livelihood had been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It directed the states to distribute free ration and update the apex court about the same.In Andhra Pradesh the government has decided to distribute the ration through Anganwadi centres. All sex workers identified by the National Aids Control Organisation (NACO) and other agencies will be provided free ration during the month of November, initially, the state government has announced.Sources quoting Krutika Shukla, Project Director of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), said the Anganwadi centres were being equipped to supply ration to about 1.2 lakh sex workers.The quantum of ration to be distributed would be similar to that given to families below poverty line (BPL), they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sex-workers-in-ap-to-get-free-ration-166494

05-11-2020||New Delhi||Air pollution increases risk of mortality from COVID-19, NGT informed||Air pollution is an important cofactor increasing the risk of mortality from COVID-19 as per the latest research, the National Green Tribunal was informed on Thursday.Senior advocate Raj Panjawani and advocate Shibhani Ghosh, who have been appointed by the tribunal as amicus curiae in a case related to ban on fire crackers, told a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel that particulate air pollution contributed 15 per cent to COVID-19 mortality worldwide.“The latest research on exposure to air pollution and risk of death from COVID-19 infection suggests that 'air pollution is an important cofactor increasing the risk of mortality from COVID- 19'," they said. “The study also states that this finding should provide 'extra motivation for combining ambitious policies to reduce air pollution with measures to control the transmission of COVID-19'. The study estimates that particulate air pollution contributed 15 per cent to COVID-19 mortality worldwide,” they added.The amicus curiae referred to a study by Andrea Pozzer and others—'Regional and global contributions of air pollution to risk of death from COVID-19'—and sought suspension of all licences issued by any authority for sale of all kinds of firecrackers.Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for Indian Fireworks Manufacturers' Association, opposed the submission of blanket ban on fire crackers and said there is no definite finding and the apex court is already seized of the matter.Advocate Balendu Shekhar, appearing for the Environment Ministry, told the NGT that there is no conclusive finding on relation of air pollution with COVID mortality, and they have written to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Earth Sciences seeking their opinion on the issue.The NGT reserved the order and said it will be uploaded on its website by November 9.The amicus referred to 'State of Global Air 2020' report released by the Health Effects Institute and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Global Burden of Disease Project, which estimates that India witnessed 980,000 deaths attributable to PM2.5.  The report also states that the long-term exposure to air pollution can cause many of the health conditions associated with increased vulnerability to COVID-19, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive lung disease, they said.The amicus told the tribunal that green crackers per se generate less pollution, nevertheless they are a major contributor towards pollution as reflected in the CPCB report.Consequently, the only alternative left under the circumstances is to take stern and surgical step to check the proliferation of all kinds of crackers in the interest of general public health and life particularly during this phase of severe COVID-19 pandemic, they said.The amicus sought suspension of all licences issued by any authority for sale of all kinds of firecrackers and if any person is found selling any kind of firecrackers would impliedly be an abettor to environmental pollution and liable for environmental damage of Rs 1 lakh.“In case of individuals found using or allowing the use of any kind of firecracker, the Hon'ble Tribunal may consider imposing a fine of not less than Rs 10,000,” the amicus suggested.The NGT had on November 2 issued notice to Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and four State governments on whether use of fire crackers be banned from November 7 to 30 in the interest of public health and environment.The tribunal was hearing a plea by Indian Social Responsibility Network, filed through Santosh Gupta, seeking action against pollution by use of fire crackers in NCR during the time air quality is unsatisfactory with potential of severity of COVID-19 pandemic.

05-11-2020||Shubhadeep Choudhury                                                                    ||As Amit Shah’s tours Bengal, his old host gets job from Mamata||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, November 5BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s tribal outreach programme in Bankura district of West Bengal on Thursday brought good luck to a tribal woman in another part of the state.Geeta Mahali, who had hosted Shah three years back at her home in Naxalbari village, received an appointment letter from West Bengal government’s home department on Thursday for working as Special Home Guard.TV grabs showed a teary-eyed Geeta shyly showing her appointment letter to mediapersons who landed at her home after they were alerted by the local TMC leadership.Day after Shah had lunch at the house of the tribal couple Raju and Geeta Mahali in a much publicised event, the very next day the state’s ruling party Trinamool Congress (TMC) managed to persuade the duo to join TMC.The turnaround caused much embarrassment to the BJP and Shah who was then president of the party.Subsequently, the Mahali couple was abandoned and forgotten by both BJP and TMC. Geeta got LPG connection under the Ujjwala Scheme. But, crippled by poverty, the family stopped buying fresh refills.Shah’s lunch programme on Thursday at the home of Bibhishan Hansda, a tribal living in Chaturdihi village in Bankura district of West Bengal, reminded the state government about Geeta and resulted in her receiving the appointment letter.Bankura is famous for its “posto” (poppy seed) recipes. Amit Shah and other BJP leaders, including party general secretary Kailash Vijaybargya, had a chance to check out some of the posto delicacies offered to them by Bibhishan, a labourer, and his wife, when the top BJP functionaries had food at his place on Thursday afternoon.Amit Shah will be around on Friday also and sure enough he has a lunch date on Friday too. This time, he will be hosted by N Biswas at his home at Rajarhat near Kolkata. Biswas belongs to the numerically strong Matua community whose votes are being eyed by both BJP and TMC.Commenting on the appointment letter handed over to Geeta Mahali today, a BJP leader here said they would be happy if the TMC government gave jobs to all those people who would host Amit Shah.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-amit-shahs-tours-bengal-his-old-host-gets-job-from-mamata-166482

05-11-2020||Kathmandu||Gen Naravane conferred honorary rank of General of Nepali Army||Indian Army chief General M M Naravane was conferred the honorary rank of General of the Nepali Army by President Bidya Devi Bhandari at a special ceremony here on Thursday, a decades old tradition that reflects the strong ties between the two militaries.He was also presented a sword and scroll during the function held at the President’s official residence ‘ShitalNiwas’ in Kathmandu.Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, Indian Ambassador Vinay M Kwatra and other senior officials of both the countries attended the ceremony.The tradition, which started in 1950, reflects the strong ties between the two militaries.Gen K M Cariappa was the first Indian Army chief to be decorated with the title in 1950. In January last year, Nepali Army chief General Purna Chandra Thapa was also made the honorary General of the Indian Army by President Ram Nath Kovind at a ceremony in New Delhi.After the ceremony, Gen Naravane called on President Bhandari and conveyed his gratitude for the honour bestowed upon him. They also discussed measures to further enhance bilateral cooperation, said a statement issued by the Indian Embassy here.He was accompanied by Indian Ambassador Kwatra.Gen Naravane, who is currently in Kathmandu on a three-day visit, earlier in the day met his Nepalese counterpart Gen Thapa at the Chief of Army Staff’s office here and discussed measures to further bolster the existing bond of friendship and cooperation between the two armies.His visit is largely aimed at resetting the bilateral ties that came under severe strain following a bitter border row early this year.“They exchanged views on issues of bilateral interests and discussed measures to further strengthen the existing bond of friendship and cooperation between the two armies,” according to the Nepal Army headquarters’ press statement.He was also briefed about the history and current roles of the Nepali Army, according to the statement.He paid homage at the martyrs’ memorial in the Army Pavilion and received a guard of honour in the Army Headquarters.India’s decision to send the Army chief to Nepal to reset the ties is seen as part of a larger exercise by New Delhi to rejuvenate relations with Myanmar, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan in the wake of greater efforts by China to expand its influence in the region.Gen Naravane is also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Oli, who is holding the defence portfolio, on the final day of his visit. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gen-naravane-conferred-honorary-rank-of-general-of-nepali-army-166479

On the other hand, an FIR was filed against Poonam for shooting an "obscene video" on a Goa beach recently.Apurva shared pictures of both actors, and tweeted: "#PoonamPandey & #MilindSoman both stripped down to their birthday suits in #Goa recently. Pandey partly, Soman completely. Pandey is in legal trouble--for obscenity. Soman is being lauded for his fit body at age 55. I guess we are kinder to our nude men than to our nude women." Milind shared the image and wrote: "Happy birthday to me! 55 and running." On the other hand, a police inspector was suspended on Thursday following outrage over actor Poonam's controversial photoshoot at a restricted dam site in South Goa.#PoonamPandey & #MilindSoman both stripped down to their birthday suits in #Goa recently. Pandey partly, Soman completely. Pandey is in legal trouble--for obscenity. Soman is being lauded for his fit body at age 55. I guess we are kinder to our nude men than to our nude women. 🤔 pic.twitter.com/qQ9UFQIYXJPhotos from the provocative shoot featuring Pandey, held at the Chapoli dam in Canacona sub district, had gone viral earlier this week, which sparked protests in the area, with ruling and opposition party members staging a protest on Thursday, demanding action against police officials permitting the shoot.On Wednesday, police also filed a First Information Report, first against unknown persons and then against Poonam Pandey under section 294 (obscenity) of the Indian Penal Code, after Goa Police received nearly half a dozen written complaints regarding the controversial photo shoot.

05-11-2020||Patna||Yogi backs CAA, Nitish dubs talk of throwing out people ‘faltu baat’||NDA partners BJP and the JD(U) appear divided on the contentious new citizenship law, with Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath asserting illegal immigrants will be thrown out of the country and the alliance’s CM face for Bihar Nitish Kumar calling such talk “faltu baat”.Notes of dissonance emanated from the JD(U)-BJP stable on Wednesday when Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar expressed displeasure over the hard line adopted by some in the coalition over illegal immigration, comments seen as a rebuff to his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath.Kumar, who heads the Janata Dal (United) and enjoys support of a section of the state’s Muslims, frowned upon the “faltu baat” (rubbish) at rallies in Araria and Kishanganj districts on Wednesday. Both districts have a heavy concentration of the minority community.“Who are these people indulging in faltu baat... that people will be thrown out of the country? Ever since you have given us a chance to serve, we have taken all people along.Who is going to throw you out? Everybody belongs to this country,” Nitish said at the rallies.The chief minister also shared the relevant clip of his speech on his official Twitter handle later in the day with the caption in Hindi—“It is our Dharma to take everybody along. This is our culture. Bihar will progress only when all stay together”.Kumar’s comments came on a day when Yogi, a firebrand BJP leader and one of the party’s star campaigners, said at a rally in Katihar, “Modi ji has found a solution to the infiltration problem in the form of the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act)”.“He has ensured that all those who have fled Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh following religious persecution feel safe here. On the other hand, those infiltrators who try to undermine the sovereignty and integrity of the country will be thrown out,” Yogi had thundered, evoking wild applause from the crowds.There are apprehensions that Yogi’s utterances, in a district situated close to the Indo-Bangladesh border, could stoke fresh apprehensions among the minorities, who fear the CAA could be a precursor to a country-wide National Register of Citizens (NRC) which could lead to their disenfranchisement.The JD(U), which had initially fumbled and ended up supporting the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in both Houses of Parliament months after opposing the legislation, later sought to undo the political damage by getting a resolution passed in the Assembly declaring that there was no need for a country- wide NRC, which has so far been limited to Assam.The resolution was passed unanimously with more than 50 MLAs of the BJP present in the House backing it. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yogi-backs-caa-nitish-dubs-talk-of-throwing-out-people-faltu-baat-166462

Unfortunately, out of those whose results have been declared, 631 kids have tested positive and are being given necessary medical attention," said an official of the state police.Now, being tested for coronavirus is essential for all children being rescued under the scheme.Remarkably, the Andhra Pradesh police have rescued 16,457 children in a week's time with the help of ChildLine and Child Welfare Committee (CWC) from various places, such as the railway stations, bus stations, parks, hotels and others public places.A majority of these children would have been kidnapped or trafficked while some would run from their families due to various reasons.Director-General of Police (DGP) Andhra Pradesh Police, Gautam Sawang—who supervised the rescue operation, deploying 794 police teams— said, that the rescued children included child labourers, children living on the streets, orphans, and also those who ran away from home.Of the 16,457 children, 13,588 were boys, and the remaining 2,869, were girls.Few children were reunited with their families while others were sent to child care centres.The state police initiated "Operation Muskaan" in January, completing three iterations already, and saving a total of 25,298 children across the southern state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/631-rescued-children-test-covid-19-positive-in-andhra-pradesh-166460

05-11-2020||Mumbai||How the 'Wild Frank' of Indian television Arnab Goswami was swooped||In a lightning strike operation, the Maharashtra Police on Wednesday morning swooped on the home of Republic TV owner and Chief Editor Arnab Goswami in the 2018 double-suicide case of a businessman in Raigad.Around 8 am, a team of over a dozen senior police officials from Mumbai and Raigad, several of them armed—led by a former 'encounter specialist' and now with the elite Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) Sachin Vaze—descended on his Worli home in Raheja Complex to pick him up.After a lot of hullaballoos for nearly 15 minutes at the flat, the police team managed to take away Arnab, once dragging him by his hair and by his arm, and bundled him into a waiting police van which whisked him off to Raigad, with a camera team from Republic TV trailing.Taken by complete surprise, the Goswamis, including Arnab, his wife Samyabrata, their teenaged son and some others strongly protested, but the police appeared to be in a rough and tough mood."We had an arrest warrant which we showed him and requested him to cooperate in everybody's interest," according to police sources, even as the family continued to argue.At one point, Goswami, who kept protesting stating that his arrest was "illegal" and wanted to speak with his lawyers, was pushed on a sofa near a French window as a couple of other cops stood nearby.His wife started arguing with Vaze and other police officials, but as she seemed to get too close, a couple of women police constable firmly made her sit on a sofa."The police asked the Republic TV team and their own video team to switch off their cameras… Then he was assaulted and not allowed to take water and medicines," she claimed.When Goswami Jr. tried to intervene for his father, he too was told to "keep off" as the police went about their job as R-TV team rushed there to capture and telecast the operations live."He (Goswami) has been arrested in connection with the suicide case of a man and his mother, registered in 2018 (in Raigad). The same court and the same police have reopened the case,", Vaze later told mediapersons.The channel strongly slammed the move for "parading the editor of a top Indian news channel like a criminal, pulled by the hair, threatened, not allowed drinking water" after 20-30 policemen barged there.Speaking from the van, Goswami said from behind the grilled window: "They assaulted me… Even my son was assaulted. They did not allow me to meet my father-in-law and mother-in-law."His shaken colleagues reporting live, made direct emotional appeals to Supreme Court and High Court judges "seeking justice" for what happened right in the middle of Mumbai, in a telecast of the dramatic developments lasting around 15 minutes.Goswami's arrest came after the Maharashtra Police reopened the case of the double-suicide of an architect Anvay Naik, 53, and his mother Kumud Naik, in her 70s—both directors of Concorde Designs Pvt. Ltd.The mother-son duo was found hanging at their Alibaug bungalow on May 5, 2018, leaving behind a suicide note saying they resorted to the extreme step owing to unpaid dues from three companies, including Goswami's Republic TV (Rs.83 lakhs), Feroz Shaikh of IcastX/Skimedia (Rs 4 crore), and Niteish Sarda of Smartworks (Rs.55 lakhs).Terming it as a 'malicious campaign', the Republic TV later denied all the allegations and said that it had cleared all the dues, after which the case was closed.In May this year, the deceased's widow Akshata and daughter Adnya complained to the state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh that the Raigad Police had not investigated the case properly, after which it was handed over to the State CID."Adnya Naik had complained to me that Alibaug Police had not investigated non-payment of dues from Arnab Goswami's Republic TV which drove her entrepreneur father and grandmom to suicide in May 2018. I've ordered a CID re-investigation of the case," Deshmukh said then.A few months ago, Akshata Naik made another appeal seeking support to her quest for justice for her late husband, just as there was clamour for justice for the late actor Sushant Singh Rajput who was found hanging in his Bandra flat in June.Today's police action has evoked mixed reactions from various quarters as the Oxford-educated Goswami has had several brushes with the Shiv Sena-Nationalist Congress Party-Congress alliance Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), starting from the April 16 Palghar lynching case of two Sadhus and their driver.In May, the Mumbai Police lodged a case against him for allegedly giving communal overtones to the Bandra migrants gathering for which he was grilled by the NM Joshi Marg Police in June.After Sushant Singh's death (June 14), Goswami and Republic TV had targeted Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, his son and Tourism Minister Aditya Thackeray, Home Minister Deshmukh, Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh, besides Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty, and others.At times, Goswami referred to them as just "Uddhav", "Anil Deshmukh", "Param Bir", and accused them of dillydallying on the Sushant Singh Rajput probe to shield some influential persons, even as the case was handed over to the CBI, and later the Enforcement Director and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) entered the fray.In October, the Mumbai Police unearthed the "TRP Scam" involving Republic TV for which many of its officials were investigated, and a similar case in Uttar Pradesh was taken over by the CBI.

Thanks to the number of cases shooting up," the bench said and added “We are going to take it very seriously.”The remarks were made by the bench while hearing a bunch of petitions relating to non-payment of salaries to doctors, paramedical staff, safai karamcharis, teachers and retired engineers and others, employed with North Delhi Municipal Corporation.

He also handed over ambulances and medical equipment, including ventilators, for two field hospitals to the Nepal Army.Thapa also reciprocated by handing over 1,00,000 medical masks made in Nepal and an idol of Lord Buddha, a symbol of peace to Naravane.President Bidhya Devi Bhandari will confer the honorary rank of General of Nepali Army on General Naravane later in the day.He is scheduled to meet Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Friday.India’s decision to send the Army chief to Nepal to reset the ties is seen as part of a larger exercise by New Delhi to rejuvenate relations with Myanmar, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Afghanistan in the wake of greater efforts by China to expand its influence in the region.The ties between the two countries came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory.Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories.After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a “unilateral act” and cautioning Kathmandu that such “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it.In June, Nepal’s Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring areas which India maintains belong to it.India termed as untenable the “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims by Nepal.India said Nepal’s action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks.Nepal Prime Minister Oli has been asserting that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to Nepal and vowed to “reclaim” them from India.The Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India.Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory - India as part of Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Dharchula district.

05-11-2020||London||India seeks expeditious extradition of Mallya, Nirav Modi from UK||Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla held talks with British Home Secretary Priti Patel in London during which he strongly underlined India’s interest in the expeditious extradition of former Kingfisher Airlines chief Vijay Mallya, who has completed all the legal processes related to extradition from the UK, and fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi.On the last leg of his three-nation Europe tour, Shringla visited London where he held discussions with several UK ministers and officials and during his interactions with Patel and UK Foreign Office Minister for South Asia, Lord Tariq Ahmad, on Tuesday, the issue of economic offenders being extradited to face the Indian judicial system was among the issues raised.“We strongly underlined our interest in seeing the early, expeditious extradition of Vijay Mallya, who is an economic offender who has completed all extradition procedures in the UK. We would like him to return to India as soon as possible,” said Shringla.“Also, Nirav Modi. I raised this with both Lord Ahmad and the Home Secretary, and both took very careful note of our priority and sentiments in that regard,” he said.Mallya, wanted in India over fraud and money laundering charges in relation to loans taken out by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines from state-owned Indian banks, has been found to have a case to answer in India by the UK courts. He is currently on bail, undergoing a “confidential” legal issue before Patel can consider signing off on his extradition order.On the other hand, Modi, the fugitive diamond merchant accused of fraud and money laundering in relation to the state-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB), is currently lodged in Wandsworth Prison in London as he fights his extradition to India at Westminster Magistrates’ Court.Shringla arrived in London following visits to Paris and Berlin on Tuesday and has held a series of meetings to cover a wide range of issues, including the India-UK vaccine partnership in a post-coronavirus world and climate change as well as highlighting India’s outlook on the growing importance of the Indo-Pacific region.On India-UK bilateral ties, the Foreign Secretary noted the backdrop of Britain’s exit from the European Union (EU) paving the way for a reset in the relationship — both with the UK and the EU.“We are looking at early harvest deals, which would bring benefits to both our countries, followed by a more detailed, either preferential trade agreement or a free trade agreement,” said Shringla.“Obviously, a limited deal means we work on those areas on which both sides can immediately agree to. We need more time to conclude a more comprehensive trade agreement but our ministers are in touch and will work on trying to close such a deal,” he said.“We are also looking at a similar deal at the EU level, but bilateral agreement is always different from an agreement with a group,” he added.The Indian High Commissioner to the UK, Gaitri Issar Kumar, highlighted the five priority areas of food and drink, life sciences, information and communications technology (ICT), chemicals and services that have been narrowed down by both sides, with Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and UK International Trade Secretary Liz Truss set to take stock of the level of movement in these areas during talks scheduled for November 9.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Prime Minister Boris Johnson are among the high-level visits from the UK to India scheduled for 2021, depending on the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown situation.Foreign Secretary Shringla noted that with the UK currently undertaking an Integrated Review of its policy framework, the Indo-Pacific region is expected to play a key part in the “transformational relationship” that Raab has previously made reference to vis-à-vis India.“We believe in the vision of free, open, transparent and inclusive Indo-Pacific stakeholders; we believe in multi-polarity. The framework is there in France and Germany and we see it in the UK also, though it is yet to be articulated in policy framework. It (the Indo-Pacific) has become more significant, relevant and topical,” said Shringla.Besides his ministerial-level and official talks, the foreign secretary also conducted a host of discussions with leading business chiefs and CEOs.

05-11-2020||London/New Delhi||UK invites PM Modi to Climate Ambition Summit 2021||The UK has invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the Climate Ambition Summit scheduled next month, according to a British government statement on Thursday.The December 12 Climate Ambition Summit will provide a platform for leaders who are ready to come forward with announcements of new, more ambitious nationally determined contributions and long-term strategies to net zero, as well as new climate finance pledges and ambitious adaptation plans.During a meeting with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla in London on Wednesday, Philip Barton, Permanent Under-Secretary at the UK's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, "extended an invitation for Prime Minister Modi to attend the December Climate Ambition Summit", the British High Commission in New Delhi said in a press release.The UK, as COP26 (to be held in Glasgow next December) President, the UN and France will host the virtual leader-level summit on the five-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement, in partnership with Chile (as COP25 President) and Italy (COP26 partner), it said.The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) was originally scheduled to be held this month. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the event was postponed to next year.The historic Paris accord committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2C above pre-industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise. The US -- the second leading producer of all carbon dioxide emissions globally, behind China -- on Wednesday formally withdrew from the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, a decision originally announced three years ago.Speaking after the meeting with Shringla, Barton said: "India has a special place in my heart and I know first-hand the importance of building the relationship between our two countries.""Shringla and I agreed a strengthened UK-India partnership will be a force for good in the world, in facing the big international challenges over the next decade, such as climate change and global security," said Barton, formerly High Commissioner to India until August this year.It was Barton's first high-level meeting with any country since taking up his new position as head of the UK's diplomatic and development service.The meeting was the latest in a series of high-level UK-India engagements, following the Finance Minister-led Economic and Financial Dialogue last week and the subsequent virtual visit of the Minister for Investment. It precedes a planned High Level Trade Ministerial in November.The discussion centred around how the UK and India will work together on their shared ambitions. Future priorities are likely to include increasing trade, tackling climate change, science and technology and defence, the release said.The UK and India also shared views on the next generation of challenges and opportunities, including assessments of emerging global security threats.Barton and Shringla explored areas for the UK and India to collaborate in multilateral events, committing to work closely together through the UK's G7 and COP Presidencies and India's G20 Presidency in 2022, the release said.

05-11-2020||New Delhi||India-made Covid vaccine could be launched as early as February: ICMR scientist||An Indian government-backed COVID-19 vaccine could be launched as early as February — months earlier than expected — as last-stage trials begin this month and studies had, so far, showed it is safe and effective, a senior government scientist has told Reuters.Bharat Biotech, a private company that is developing COVAXIN with the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), had earlier hoped to launch it only in the second quarter of next year.“The vaccine has shown good efficacy,” senior ICMR scientist Rajni Kant, who is also a member of its COVID-19 task-force, said at the research body’s New Delhi headquarters on Thursday.“It is expected that by the beginning of next year, February or March, something would be available,” Kant said.Bharat Biotech could not immediately be contacted.A launch in February would make COVAXIN the first India-made vaccine to be rolled out.India’s cases of coronavirus infections rose by 50,201 cases on Thursday to 8.36 million, second only to the United States.Deaths rose by 704, with the total now at 1,24,315. The daily rise in infections and deaths has slowed since a peak in mid-September.Kant, who is the head of ICMR’s research management, policy, planning and coordination cell, said it was up to the Health Ministry to decide if COVAXIN shots could be given to people even before the third-stage trials were over.“It has shown safety and efficacy in phase 1 and 2 trials and in the animal studies — so it is safe but you can’t be 100 per cent sure unless the phase 3 trials are over,” Kant said.“There may be some risk, if you are ready to take the risk, you can take the vaccine. If necessary, the government can think of giving the vaccine in an emergency situation,” he added.Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said in September that the government was considering granting an emergency authorisation for a COVID-19 vaccine, particularly for the elderly and people in high-risk workplaces.Several leading vaccine candidates are already in final-stage testing. An experimental vaccine developed by Britain’s AstraZeneca is among the most advanced ones, and Britain expects to roll it out in late December or early 2021.AstraZeneca has signed several supply-and-manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world, including with the Serum Institute of India.Other late-stage vaccines are developed by Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE, and Johnson & Johnson.

05-11-2020||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Bengal has blocked more than 80 Central schemes: Amit Shah||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, November 5BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said more than 80 welfare schemes meant for the marginalised sections had been blocked in West Bengal by the Mamata Banerjee regime.Shah, who landed in Kolkata on Wednesday evening for a two-day tour of the state, told this to journalists after garlanding the statue of Santhal hero Birsa Munda at Bankura on Thursday.Shah said the schemes not being implemented in West Bengal were meant for the poor, the Dalits, the tribes and the backward people.Those who are in the grip of extreme poverty are not benefitting from the Government of India schemes meant to help them in their livelihood needs, Shah said.Noting that Bankura was having substantial tribal population, Shah said they were entitled to benefit from the housing scheme for tribes unveiled by the Central Government. But the funds were not reaching them because of the state government, he alleged.Shah added that similarly, farmers were being deprived of the Rs 6,000 annually given to them by the Central Government under a scheme. The Mamata Banerjee-led government had also prevented the Central Government from bringing Bengal under the ambit of the Rs 5 lakh health insurance coverage meant for the poor people, he said.“Mamata didi should not think that by blocking the Central welfare schemes, she could stop the BJP. Rather, if she allows the Rs 6,000 arranged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the poor reach the beneficiaries, allow them to benefit from the Central health scheme, let them have toilets and housing, only then the poor folk may think a little bit about her also,” Shah said.The Union Home Minister claimed that since his arrival in Kolkata last evening, he noticed that the public was extremely angry with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Public was keen on a positive change to take place in the state under the leadership Narendra Modi, the BJP leader said.Shah, who had a meeting last night with the family members of a BJP booth-level functionary who died in police custody recently, said the oppression unleashed by the Mamata Banerjee-led government, especially the violence targeting the BJP workers, was a clear signal that death knell had already sounded for the regime.Shah said he was certain that the BJP would come to power in West Bengal by winning two-third majority.The Union Home Minister said the security of the country was inseparably linked with the security situation of Bengal.“It is important from the security point of view that youths of Bengal get jobs. It is also necessary to uplift people crippled by poverty,” Shah said and appealed to the people to give a chance to the party to transform the state into “Sonar Bangla” (Golden Bengal).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengal-has-blocked-more-than-80-central-schemes-amit-shah-166426

It was extended to six months till August 31, 2020. The government said more than 50 per cent of the borrowers didn’t avail of the moratorium.The RBI and the Finance Ministry have already told the court that the banks, financial and non-banking financial institutions would credit into the accounts of eligible borrowers by November 5 the difference between compound and simple interest collected on loans of up to Rs 2 crore during the moratorium scheme period.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rbi-urges-sc-to-vacate-order-restraining-banks-from-classifying-accounts-as-npas-166423

The state BJP leaders should demand justice for Anvay Naik, a son of the soil," the editorial said."An innocent man died by suicide along with his aged mother. The dead man's wife is demanding justice and the police are following the law," it said."Where is the question of the fourth pillar (of democracy) being attacked? Those who are saying this are attempting to trample the first pillar," the editorial said.Everyone including prime ministers is equal before the law of the land, it said.

05-11-2020||Mumbai||Arnab Goswami’s arrest appears to be prima facie ‘illegal’: Court||A court at Alibaug in Maharashtra while refusing to remand Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami in police custody in a 2018 abetment to suicide case observed that the arrest of Goswami and two other accused “appears to be prima facie illegal”.Chief Judicial Magistrate Sunaina Pingle after perusal of the case diary and other relevant documents on Wednesday noted that the prosecution failed to prima facie establish a link between the deceased and the accused persons.The magistrate in a late Wednesday night order remanded Goswami and two other accused in judicial custody till November 18 in the case of suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother over alleged non-payment of dues by companies of the accused persons.“Taking into consideration the reasons behind the arrest of the accused persons and the arguments put forth by the accused persons, the arrest appears to be prima facie illegal,” the court said.The magistrate noted that the chain of circumstances, the reason behind the deaths of Anvay Naik and his mother Kumodini Naik and its connection with the accused persons are not established by the prosecution.“There is no cogent evidence submitted that warrants this court to remand the arrested accused to police custody,” the court said.A team of Raigad police picked up Goswami (47) from his residence at Lower Parel in Mumbai on Wednesday morning.Also read:Arnab Goswami spends night at school designated as jail's Covid centreHow the 'Wild Frank' of Indian television Arnab Goswami was tamedGoswami and the two other accused — Feroze Shaikh and Nitesh Sarda — were later produced before magistrate Pingle in Raigad’s Alibaug town, around 90 km from Mumbai, and were remanded in judicial custody till November 18.The court ruling came shortly after 11 pm.The magistrate in the order noted that if the police case is to be accepted that Anvay Naik took the drastic step of committing suicide due to non-payment of dues by Goswami and the two other accused, then the question arises as to why his (Anvay Naik’s) mother Kumodini Naik committed suicide.“Did she (Kumodini) die by suicide? There is no clear answer to this by the prosecution. The police have been unable to establish a link between the deaths of Kumodini Naik and Anvay Naik and the three arrested accused,” the court said.While refusing to remand the three accused in police custody, the court also noted that the police have not been able to specifically point out the so-called lacunae in the probe done by the previous police team in 2018 in the case.The magistrate in the order also said the case was investigated by the police in 2018 and an ‘A’ summary report seeking closure of the case was submitted before the court concerned in 2019.“The said closure report was accepted by the magistrate in 2019. Since then neither the prosecution nor the complainant challenged the closure report in the sessions court or High Court,” the court said.The court further said the Alibaug police did not seek the magistrate’s permission before reopening the case.“The investigating officer on October 15, 2020 only submitted a report to the magistrate informing that certain fresh material has come to the fore in the case. There is no record to show that the magistrate permitted reopening of the case,” the court said.

A senior lawyer dealing with military law said, “The DMA (Department of Military Affairs) has no locus standi to alter the existing formula and the decision would be challenged in court”.The DMA, headed by Gen Bipin Rawat, is a newly created entity under the Ministry of Defence and is tasked for HR and coordination issues between the Army, Navy and the Air Force.A letter sent out by the DMA office on October 29 says a draft of the government sanction letter is being readied by November 10 for review by Gen Rawat, the DMA Secretary and also the Chief of Defence Staff.The letter proposes to increase the retirement age of Colonels, Brigadiers and Major Generals to 57, 58 and 59 years from 54, 56 and 58 years currently.The same yardstick will apply to officers of similar rank in the Navy and Air Force. The core issue, however, is the pension formula, which is now suggested to be in a format that increases the emoluments with years of service (see box). The MoD’s rising pension bill has been an issue of intense debate since the ‘One rank, one pension’ scheme was implemented. In the ongoing fiscal ending March 31, 2021, the pension bill stands at Rs 1,33,819 crore, which is 28 per cent of the ministry’s overall budget of Rs 4,71,372 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/premature-military-retirees-may-see-pension-cut-166072
