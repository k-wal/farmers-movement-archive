Congress candidate from Kishanganj had won by 1266 votes. BJP candidate had gone home. But our candidate is not being given a certificate of victory. Democracy is being murdered and mandate being abducted in Bihar,” Surjewala tweeted late tonight after EC ruled out any foul play.Surjewala earlier claimed that the Congress candidate from Sakra had won by 600 votes but was “declared defeated by 1,700 votes”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/surjewala-makes-direct-allegation-of-foul-play-in-bihar-168858
10-11-2020||New Delhi||Bypoll results proved Kamal Nath, Digvijaya ‘biggest traitors’ of MP: Scindia||Powering the BJP to a big win in the Madhya Pradesh bypolls, Jyotiraditya Scindia on Tuesday said the results show that the people of the state consider Congress leaders Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh to be “the biggest traitors”.Out of the 28 assembly seats in the Madhya Pradesh bypolls, the BJP has won 16 seats and was leading on at least three more seats at 10.25 pm, as per the latest results, after a high-decibel campaign that saw a no-hold-barred battle between Scindia and his former colleagues from the Congress.Scindia thanked the people of Madhya Pradesh for reposing their trust in the BJP in Madhya Pradesh and asserted that the credit for it first goes to the “sterling” leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, party president JP Nadda and Home Minister Amit Shah.Asked what he would like to say to Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh after this emphatic win, Scindia told PTI, “I have nothing to say to them because the people of Madhya Pradesh have told them quite a lot by this verdict.”            “It is very clear that if there are any traitors in Madhya Pradesh, the people of Madhya Pradesh deem, Mr Digvijaya Singh and Mr Kamal Nath, the duo, as the biggest traitors of Madhya Pradesh and that is quite apparent in the verdict that has come out in this election. The people have spoken,” the former union minister said.On former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh’s claim that the electronic voting machines (EVMs) can be hacked and tampered with, he said what can one do with people who do not have faith in democracy.“If you don’t accept people’s verdict, people will continue to cast you aside and that is the lesson people like Mr Digvijaya Singh and the Congress need to learn,” he said.Scindia also hailed the state leadership of the BJP, including Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and state unit chief V D Sharma, and said everyone worked as one single unit to make this result possible.Credit for the result must also go “fully and completely” to every single worker on the ground who worked as if it was his or her own election, he said.“I find it my privilege and my honour to work in an organisation that works unitedly with a single-minded purpose as the Bhartiya Janata Party does and so therefore credit (must go) to the organisation and the leadership and a great thanks to the confidence reposed in us by the people of Madhya Pradesh,” he said.By-elections were necessitated after 22 rebel Congress MLAs, loyal to Scindia, resigned from the party in March this year leading to fall of the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh. Later, three more MLAs resigned and joined BJP, while further three seats fell vacant due to the death of sitting MLAs.

10-11-2020||New Delhi||Disease burden may increase drastically if COVID-19, air pollution get combined: AIIMS director||There is an urgent need to look for sustainable solutions and be more aggressive towards controlling air pollution, more so with the COVID-19 pandemic being around, as it can lead to a huge burden of diseases if both get combined, the AIIMS director said on Tuesday.There is definitely an ongoing wave, especially in many parts of India, and air pollution is making it worse, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said at ASSOCHAM webinar on ‘COVID-19-Coming of the Second Wave: Myth or Reality’, according to a statement by the industry body.“So, we need to act on multiple fronts to get hold as far as this pandemic is concerned,” he said. He said Delhi is facing a double whammy of air pollution and COVID-19 as a virus can survive for a long time in pollution, which can cause more severe diseases.“There is no doubt that we are having a second wave but possibly multiple waves in different parts of the country as the number of cases increase.“In our hospital we had created a facility with almost 1,500 beds for COVID patients, we had during June-July almost 900 patients admitted at a given point in time, it came down to about 200, but now again it is rising, and we have more than 500 COVID patients,” Guleria was quoted as saying in the statement.The All India Institute Of Medical Sciences director also said since the ‘unlock’ has happened, the load on the hospital has increased significantly as now it is facing a huge burden as the number of COVID-19 cases is increasing which is causing a huge strain on healthcare facilities.He outlined three major reasons for the rise in COVID-19 cases - COVID fatigue and lack of COVID appropriate behaviour as people are not following social distancing or wearing masks; respiratory viruses peak during winter months and Delhi’s poor air quality leading to rise in air pollution.Guleria said there is data suggesting that mortality during air pollution continues to be high, the statement said.“Every year in our hospital, we have done a study where we have followed all our admissions in an emergency for two years and what we found was that whenever the air quality index worsened there was an increase in admissions both in children and adults for respiratory diseases in the next 5-6 days.“This is being shown for the last 2-3 years, now with air pollution and COVID-19 this is going to become a huge burden,” he was quoted as saying in the statement.Gulera also said that during this time of year there is an increase in allergic disorders like sneezing, running nose and a large number of cases of flu, therefore it becomes challenging in differentiating between upper respiratory manifestations. “So, I think all individuals who have an influenza-like illness like fever, sore throat, headache, body ache, cough should at least get themselves tested for COVID-19,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disease-burden-may-increase-drastically-if-covid-19-air-pollution-get-combined-aiims-director-168856
10-11-2020||Patna/New Delhi||Bihar results: Those calling us vote-cutter have got ‘befitting’ reply, says Owaisi's AIMIM||Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen, which was given tags like ‘vote cutter’ and spoiler in the Bihar assembly polls, appeared set to win five Muslim-dominated seats on Tuesday and said its critics have got a befitting reply from the people.With the election results on a knife’s edge, AIMIM could play a key role in the formation of the next government in case there is a hung assembly, having captured a sizeable number of seats in the state’s Seemanchal region, which was being seen as a stronghold of the grand opposition alliance.AIMIM national spokesperson Asim Waqar told PTI that a final decision on which party AIMIM could back in case of a hung assembly will be taken by Owaisi, but ruled out supporting the BJP, asserting that his party’s fight has always been against the saffron party.Ahead of the polling in the third phase of the polls, the Congress had dubbed the AIMIM as the BJP’s “B-team” and had accused the party of colluding with the BJP. Congress’ Bihar unit chief Madan Mohan Jha had said AIMIM will not have any significant impact on the assembly polls as people will not “waste” their votes.Asked about the assertion of the Congress and the Mahagathbandhan calling it a “vote cutter”, Waqar said: “Those calling us that have got a befitting reply and their mouths will now be shut in the future as well”.On whether his party was likely to go with Mahagathbandhan or the NDA, he said: “The decision will be taken by Asad (Owaisi) sahab, but the reality is that our fight is against the BJP and for the country. So the BJP and its alliance do not appear anywhere in our list”.  Expressing happiness over the AIMIM’s performance, he said the party workers were expecting such a result as they had toiled hard on the ground for the last five years.Election Commission website shows the AIMIM has won three seats and leads in two.Owaisi-led AIMIM seems to have cut big time into the Mahagathbandhan vote in the Seemanchal region in the third phase of the polls.The AIMIM was in the fray for 20 seats in Bihar polls, a majority of which went to polls in the third phase on November 7, as part of the Grand Democratic Secular Front that has four other parties, including Upendra Kushwaha’s Rashtriya Lok Samta Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party.

There was a loud sound and about 15 labourers were buried under the debris,” he said.During the rescue operation, the bodies of six labourers were pulled out from the rubble. Ten labourers, who were injured, were rushed to the hospital. They are undergoing treatment at Mathura Das Mathur Hospital and AIIMS, he said.Ojha said none of the victims has been identified so far. Some of them are said to have come from other districts and working under a contractor.“We would also look into the matter with regard to any negligence by the civil contractor and register a case against him accordingly,” he said.Administration and police officials are supervising the rescue operation. Lighting arrangements have been made to facilitate the operation at night.In a tweet in Hindi, Gehlot said the news about the death of labourers was “extremely unfortunate”.The state government has announced an ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh for the families of each of the deceased. The probe into the matter has been handed over to the divisional commissioner, Jodhpur. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/6-labourers-killed-10-injured-as-wall-of-under-construction-factory-collapses-in-jodhpur-168851
10-11-2020||Vibha Sharma||BJP in driving seat for the first time in Bihar||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 10Even while swinging wildly between two main contestants (JD-U’s Nitish Kumar-led NDA and RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav-led ‘mahagathbandhan’), the results of the 2020 Bihar elections today firmly put into place the BJP in the driving seat, reducing the five-time CM Nitish Kumar to the secondary position, for the first time in the NDA relationship in the state. Now whosoever becomes the Chief Minister, the BJP has become the dominant political force in the Bihar, say political observers. Though the top BJP leadership has said that Nitish Kumar will be the CM even if the JD-U gets lesser numbers, voices are expected to start emerging from within the state unit for a BJP CM, they believe. And as the party’s national general secretary Tarun Chugh interestingly mentioned “it will be CM of the choice of PM Narendra Modi, whether from the JD-U or the BJP”.The downsizing of JD-U’s numbers has also put on the roll the saffron party’s long-term plans to strike alone in the state sometime in future. And if Nitish Kumar becomes the CM it will be on BJP’s terms. Therefore in those terms, the saffron party has emerged as the big gainer in these elections. The BJP called it an “endorsement” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his policies amid the Covid pandemic.“The NDA was fighting with a handicap of 15-year anti-incumbency of Nitish Kumar but Prime Minister Modi steered the situation in its favour. And this despite not such a good beginning in the Phase-I,” party leaders say. The results from the bypolls and Bihar have also given BJP president JP Nadda much to cheer about. Nadda put his heart and soul in these elections, micro-strategising with different political tools and options to turn an adverse election in BJP’s favour. Despite exit polls predicting otherwise, the BJP-JDU-HAM-VIP franchise worked well in complex caste matrix of Bihar. Though LJP’s Chirag Paswan, struggling with just one seat  till the time of filing of this report, managed to push Nitish Kumar to the third place and making him dependent on BJP, there is another side to the story. A section believes that Chirag actually “diverted attention from anger against Nitish Kumar”. “He played the role of a ‘vote katuwa’ but in favour of the NDA. The anti-Nitish Kumar forward votes that may have gone to the ‘mahagathbandhan’ were presented another option in the form of the LJP, likewise in the case of AIMIM in Seemanchal,” they say. Along with “behind-the-scene” political support and backing by substantial force of ‘silent’ women voters defying classic caste combinations, the BJP also managed to consolidate ‘non-Yadav, non-Muslims and forward voters’ in its favour. “It was a combination of forward, non-Yadav OBCs and majority of MBCs, EBCs and Dalits that worked iwith VIP and HAM(S) adding key caste vote banks for the NDA.  Mahagathbandhan’s decision to give more seats to Congress and part ways with Mukesh Sahani-led VIP worked for NDA,” they add.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-in-driving-seat-for-the-first-time-in-bihar-168848
10-11-2020||Islamabad||India’s cooperation key to implement ICJ verdict in Jadhav case: Pak court||A Pakistani court has said India’s cooperation was necessary to implement the International Court of Justice’s verdict in death-row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav’s case, stating that the Indian High Commission here could approach it if it has reservations.The Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb on Monday heard a petition filed by the law ministry seeking the appointment of a lawyer for Jadhav to file a review plea against his death sentence by a Pakistani military court in 2017, Geo News reported.During the hearing, Attorney General Khalid Jawed Khan said that the federal government has taken all measures to ensure the implementation of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) decision, the report said.Asked about the steps taken to eliminate India’s reservations, Khan alleged that New Delhi was deliberately avoiding the court proceedings, it said.Justice Minallah said that India’s cooperation was necessary to implement the ICJ verdict and stated that the Indian High Commission could approach the court if it had reservations.The bench then adjourned hearing till December 1.Fifty-year-old retired Indian Navy officer Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017.In 2017, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence handed to him by a military court.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.A Pakistani court was informed on October 6 that India failed to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav in the case of the review of his death sentence by a military court in this country.Earlier, Pakistan had again rejected India’s demand that an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel should be appointed for Jadhav to ensure a free and fair trial in the case.On October 8, India said that Pakistan has failed to address the core issues in Jadhav’s case and pressed for an “unimpeded, unconditional and unhindered” consular access to him as ordered by the ICJ.“The core issues need to be addressed if we have to have effective review and reconsideration as ordered by the international court of justice. Pakistan must show its intention to deliver on the core issues,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-cooperation-key-to-implement-icj-verdict-in-jadhav-case-pak-court-168845

10-11-2020||Ravi S Singh||Left parties want to replicate Bihar formula for Bengal election||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 10A comparatively good performance by the Left parties in alliance with RJD-led Mahagathbandhan in the Bihar Assembly elections has encouraged them to implement the Bihar model of opposition unity for the coming Assembly election in West Bengal to defeat the ruling TMC and the BJP in the state.Trend of counting of votes in Bihar, which has been slow stretching into late evening, due to Election Commission (EC) safety guidelines relating to Covid-19, suggest Left parties were ahead in 19 seats.The CPI(M-L), CPI and the CPI(M) had in all contested 30 seats. Due to strong intervention by former Bihar chief minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, the Left parties were included in the Mahagathbandhan, which also consist of the Congress. Yadav’s son and former Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav led the alliance.The Yadav senior had pitched for inclusion of Left parties to prevent split anti BJP-JD(U) votes.Even though leaders of the Left parties are disappointed with the performance of the Congress, they strongly root for replication of the formula of opposition unity in West Bengal.“The poor performance by the Congress has pulled down the overall show of the Mahagathbandhan in Bihar. But election in the state has amply demonstrated that unity among and democratic and secular forces can effectively counter the BJP,” national CPI(M) leader Hannan Mollah said.CPI head D Raja said the Bihar elections have shown that electorates are more concerned with issues affecting their daily lives.“The Left consistently raise these issues, and the people of Bihar have taken note of it.“Both the ruling TMC in Bengal, and the BJP-led Union government have trifled with basic issues, including migrant labourers and Covid pandemic in Bengal,” Raja said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/left-parties-want-to-replicate-bihar-formula-for-bengal-election-168840
10-11-2020||Vijay Mohan||Air Vice Marshal wins battle for higher salary, avers juniors draw more pay||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 10Nearly a year after retirement, an Air Vice Marshal has won a legal battle for higher salary after he had contended that officers junior to him and those posted under his command, were drawing higher pay.The Armed Forces Tribunal has ordered the government to step up his pay retrospectively with effect from July 2017 to bring it on par with his immediate juniors and thereafter grant him all arrears and consequential benefits along with re-fixing his pension accordingly.Air Vice Marshal P Subhash Babu, who was commissioned into the Accounts Branch of the IAF in June 1985 and retired after rendering 34 years of service, had averred that his pay as on July 1, 2017 was Rs 2,18,200, including the Military Service Pay (MSP) component, whereas two of his junior officers at the rank of Air Commodore who were commissioned much after him were drawing Rs 2,26,800 and Rs 2,20,600, respectively.When he was promoted as Air Vice Marshal in July 1016, there was no separate MSP for Air Vice Marshal and equivalents and MSP was subsumed into the basic pay for officers at this rank and above. MSP was granted to defence personnel as a separate element of pay up to the rank of Air Commodore and equivalent.He also pointed out that the Ministry of Defence, while processing a statutory complaint filed by him in this regard, returned it saying that the matter was being examined by the ministry, but till date, no decision has been taken.“Merely because the Union of India has taken no decision in the matter to remove the anomaly, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the principle of stepping-up of pay is a well settled principle in service jurisprudence,” the tribunal’s bench comprising Justice Rajendra Menon and Lt Gen PM Hariz said in its order of November 4.“It has been enforced only for the purpose of removing anomaly in the pay scale and pension between a junior and senior officer and if the anomaly has arisen on account of revision of pay-scales, the same should be removed by stepping-up of pay of the senior officers, as has been done in the case of SN Chaturvedi by the Delhi High Court,” the bench said.Suresh Babu had relied upon Chaturvedi’s case of 1990, who was also then an Air Vice Marshal and had faced a similar situation following the implementation of the Fourth Pay Commission.The Tribunal also observed that circulars have been issued by the defence ministry in the matter of stepping-up of pay of Major Generals and equivalents, and it is indicated that the question of extending the benefit by Delhi High Court has been examined by the Government of India and similarly placed Major Generals and equivalent officers would be granted stepping up of pay if officers lower in rank like Brigadiers are drawing more pay.“In rejecting the statutory complaint without considering all these aspects, the    respondents have committed grave irregularities and illegalities, and accordingly, the impugned order being unsustainable, is quashed,” the bench further ruled.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-vice-marshal-wins-battle-for-higher-salary-avers-juniors-draw-more-pay-168834

It is a legal case. So it is difficult for me to comment substantially on it,” acting high commissioner of the UK Jan Thompson said.She was replying to a question on the issue at an online media briefing.“The extradition cannot take place until that particular legal issue is resolved. It is a confidential issue. I cannot say anymore on it. Nor can I estimate how long it will take to be resolved. We are trying to resolve the issue as quickly as we can,” Thompson said.India has been pressing the UK to extradite Mallya after he lost his appeals in the British Supreme Court.The UK top court’s decision marked a major setback to the 64-year-old businessman as it came weeks after he lost his High Court appeal in April against an extradition order to India.In June, India urged the UK not to consider any request for asylum by Mallya as there appeared to be no ground for his persecution in the country. Mallya has been based in the UK since March 2016 and remains on bail on an extradition warrant executed three years ago by Scotland Yard on April 18, 2017.The High Court verdict in April upheld the 2018 ruling by Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot at the end of a year-long extradition trial in December 2018 that the former Kingfisher Airlines boss had a “case to answer” in the Indian courts. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trying-to-resolve-issue-holding-up-vijay-mallyas-extradition-to-india-uk-168820

Joe Biden replied to Leslie through a letter dated May 30, 1981, said he was pleased after getting the letter from India and also discussed about the Bidens' genealogy," she said.Sonia's elder brother Ian Biden (44), a former seafarer in the merchant navy, who also stays in Nagpur, said Leslie and Joe Biden shared information regarding a common ancestor John Biden and his wife Anne Beaumont."Leslie and Joe Biden thanked each other for corresponding and committed to continue corresponding with each other. However, Leslie Biden's health worsened and he died in 1983 at Nagpur. Leslie's wife was unable to pursue the family tree further," said Leslie's granddaughter Rowena, who also lives in Nagpur.The Biden family showed this correspondent letters they claimed were part of the correspondence between Leslie and Joe Biden.Asked if the Nagpur-based Bidens would attend Joe Biden's inauguration in January, the family members said they are extending their best wishes to the 77-year-old Biden."The Bidens of Nagpur, Mumbai, New Zealand and the US gathered in January 2018 for the wedding of Leslie's grandson Leslie David Biden," Sonia said.Leslie Biden's descendants live in Nagpur, Mumbai, the US, Australia and New Zealand, Sonia said. The Bidens living in Nagpur include Leslie's daughter-in-law Angelina Biden.Leslie's daughter Evelyn Majumdar, grandson Duncan Biden and granddaughter Sheryl Dweltz live in Mumbai, Sonia said, adding the Bidens have been living in Mumbai since 1971.Leslie Biden's granddaughter Lillian Biden D'souza stays in Nagpur as do his grandsons Leslie Biden and Nigel Lazarus, she said. His daughter Charmaine Biden Borges and grandchildren Denzil, Charlene, and David stay in New Zealand, while Erica and Lincoln stay in Australia. Another grandkid Tithi also lives abroad, she added.Speaking at the Bombay Stock Exchange on July 24, 2013, Biden said, "It's an honour to be back in India and to be here in Mumbai. Off script for a second here, I was reminded I was elected to the United States Senate when I was a 29-year-old kid back in 1972, and one of the first letters I received and I regret I never followed up on it."Maybe, some genealogist in audience can follow up for me, but I received a letter from a gentleman named Biden - Biden, my name - from Mumbai, asserting that we were related," Biden had told the Mumbai audience seven years ago.In his 2015 speech in Washington, Biden had claimed that his "great, great, great, great, great-grandfather" George Biden was a Captain in the East India Trading company and after retirement, decided to settle in India and married an Indian woman."There are five Bidens in Mumbai, India," Biden had told the audience.Biden had also said someone provided him with the details including the phone numbers of the Bidens in Mumbai.He had informed the audience that he was yet to call his kin but was planning to do so.

10-11-2020||Guwahati||Himanta Biswa Sarma booked for false claim on social media: Police||A case was registered against powerful Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma for allegedly promoting enmity between different groups by making “false statements”, days after he claimed on social media that AIUDF supporters raised “Pakistan Zindabad” slogans at the Silchar airport, police said on Tuesday.The case was lodged on the basis of a complaint filed by the Congress on Monday at the Bhangagarh police station in Guwahati, they said.Sarma and a brigade of BJP leaders on November 5 slammed the supporters of AIUDF president Badruddin Ajmal, alleging that they had raised “Pakistan Zindabad” slogans at the Silchar airport, but the opposition party refuted it and said the BJP twisted the “Aziz Khan Zindabad” slogan.“A case was registered under relevant sections. We will investigate the matter as per the law,” a senior police official told PTI.Another official said that the case has been registered under IPC Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups) and 511 (attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment).“These sections will be read with Section 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the IT Act,” he added.The slogans were raised as Aziz Ahmed Khan, the AIUDF MLA from Karimganj South constituency, was accompanying Ajmal, a Lok Sabha MP, at the airport in Silchar in the linguistically and religiously sensitive Barak Valley.“Look at the brazenness of these fundamentalists anti-national people who are shouting PAKISTAN ZINDABAD while they welcome MP Badruddin Ajmal. This thoroughly exposes Indian National Congress which is encouraging such forces by forging an alliance. We shall fight them tooth and nail. Jai Hind,” Sarma had said on Facebook.Sarma, the convenor of the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), is a powerful politician of the region and holds most of the key portfolios in the Assam government, including Finance, Health and Education.In the complaint filed by state Congress general secretary Ranjan Bora, it was alleged that Sarma has the “habit” of making “communally sensitive” remarks, and such a statement was made about the slogans raised at the Silchar airport to create “disharmony between different groups”.“It will be pertinent to mention herein that the said accused person had a habit of making loose and communally sensitive statements and at a time when assembly elections are around the corner, such statement can create communal tension,” it added.The complaint also pointed out that Facebook had flagged the post by Sarma as “false and fake” after getting it verified by third-party fact-checkers.A day after the video was uploaded by Sarma, Facebook said: “Independent fact-checkers say that this information has no basis in fact.” Facebook had also blocked the video from auto-play.However, Facebook has now withdrawn its note of caution on the video without any explanation.Meanwhile, Silchar’s BJP MP Rajdeep Roy said he had filed a complaint with the police against Ajmal and AIUDF supporters over the slogans.The AIUDF is part of the ‘Grand Alliance’ being forged by the Congress against the ruling BJP and its allies for the state assembly elections, likely to be held next year.

10-11-2020||New Delhi||Student’s suicide: Did not get documents required for scholarship from victim, says DST||The Department of Science and Technology (DST) on Tuesday said it had not received the necessary documents, including bank account details, for the disbursal of scholarship funds from Aishwarya Reddy, a student of the Lady Shri Ram (LSR) College for Women here who committed suicide last week.Reddy, an IAS aspirant, was found hanging at her Shadnagar house in Telangana’s Ranga Reddy district on November 2. In a suicide note purportedly written by her, the 19-year-old woman said she did not want to burden her parents with her educational expenses.Reddy was offered the Inspire Scholarship for Higher Education (SHE) under the Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) scheme of the DST. She was eligible for a scholarship amount of Rs 60,000 per annum.“As in other years, the provisional fellowship letters of scholarship were sent out to 9,762 eligible applicants in August this year.“The students are asked to upload three simple documents like bank account details, mark-sheet, and a bona fide/performance certificate from the college, following which scholarship for the entire year is promptly released. Regretfully, these documents were not received from Aishwarya,” the DST said in a statement.It also appealed to all the shortlisted candidates to complete their formalities quickly so that the scholarship amounts can be disbursed at the earliest.On Monday, members of the Congress-affiliated National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) protested outside the residence of Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal “Nishank” here over Reddy’s suicide, while the Left-affiliated All India Students’ Association (AISA) staged an agitation outside the Delhi University’s Arts Faculty.A group also protested outside the DST at Mehrauli.“We invited five of the student representatives, who were protesting, and showed them all the necessary documents that there was no delay on our part,” DST secretary Ashutosh Sharma said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/students-suicide-did-not-get-documents-required-for-scholarship-from-victim-says-dst-168814

Two other NDA members were leading in eight seats.The NDA in total had won or was leading in 122 seats while the RJD-led opposition had won or was ahead in 110 seats. ---- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ljp-sinks-but-brings-jd-u-down-ruling-party-says-nitish-targeted-as-part-of-sinister-campaign-168808

10-11-2020||Beijing||China says it is providing convenience to stranded Indian ship under COVID-19 limits||China on Tuesday said it was providing “convenience” within the permissible COVID-19 limits to the 23-member crew of the Indian ship stranded at a Chinese port for five months with Australian coal.The ship “Jag Anand” carrying a huge consignment of Australian coal to China has been stuck at China's Jingtang port since June with the crew members seeking immediate relief as the vessel remained in the queue since arriving in June this year.Their plight has been highlighted by the National Union of Seafarers of India, International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) and International Maritime Organisation, according to a statement by ITF-Asia Pacific Region.Asked about the ITF expressing grave concerns over the plight of the Indian sailors onboard the ship, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told the media: "As I understand, China has clear regulations on ports epidemic prevention and control and crew members quarantine requirement and as much as the regulations allow, we are providing convenience to these crew members.”“As for the specifics, I would still refer you to the competent Chinese authorities or relevant local government," he said.Officials of the Indian Embassy here said the plight of the Indian crew has been taken up with the provincial government of the Hebei province where the port is located since September this year.They said the Hebei government in its response has said the ship is in the queue for berthing and crew change cannot be allowed due to strict protocols related to the COVID-19 pandemic.It offered to provide any medical assistance to the crew in case of any emergency and stated that the vessel can leave if it wishes to, officials said, adding that the response of the Hebei government has been conveyed to the shipping company.China on Monday said it has no information on reports about the ship.Relations between Australia and China in the past few months nose-dived after Australia barred Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies from its national 5G network over national security concerns.China also resented Canberra's push for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus in April.Reports from Australia say China has been restricting a number of Australian exports, including coal.Apart from this, China appears to be irked by a law Australia passed in 2018 that banned covert foreign interference in domestic politics and made industrial espionage for a foreign power a crime.The laws offended the nation's most important trading partner, China.Recently, the Chinese Communist Party-controlled Global Times reported that China had asked traders to stop buying at least seven categories of Australian products: coal, barley, copper ore and concentrate, sugar, timber, wine and lobsters.

I stand by it. There have been doubters of the EVM from across political parties, particularly when the results don’t go in their favour. Till now no one has demonstrated scientifically their claims. Whatever be the outcome of any election, it’s time to stop blaming the EVM. In my experience, the EVM system is robust, accurate and dependable,” he tweeted.Responding to a question on doubts being raised by some politicians, Deputy Election Commissioner in-charge of EVMs Sudip Jain told reporters here that the machines are absolutely robust and tamper-proof.“It has been clarified time and again that EVMs are absolutely robust and tamper-proof. Even the Supreme Court has upheld their integrity more than once,” he said.Jain recalled that in 2017, the commission had offered an “EVM challenge” to political parties.“The integrity of EVMs is absolutely without any doubts and merits no other clarification,” he said.Udit Raj asked if Donald Trump could have lost in the US presidential polls had EVMs been used.“If the direction of satellites to Mars and Moon can be controlled from the earth, then why can’t EVM be hacked,” he wrote on Twitter.“If elections were held in America with EVMs, could Trump have lost,” he asked.Udit Raj is the Congress party’s national spokesperson. He is a former BJP MP from Delhi. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/evms-absolutely-robust-and-tamper-proof-says-ec-after-congress-leader-raises-questions-on-their-reliability-168800
10-11-2020||Jaipur||Jats, Muslims renew quota demand amid Gurjar agitation in Rajasthan||Groups from the Jat and Muslim communities in Rajasthan have renewed their demand for reservations, amid ongoing agitations in the state by Gurjars for quota in government jobs and educational institutions.The protest by members of the Gurjar community, who have blocked the Delhi-Mumbai rail route in Pilupura and the Hindaun-Bayana road, entered its tenth day on Tuesday after talks between its leaders and the Rajasthan government remained inconclusive on Monday.Leaders from the Jat community in Bharatpur and Dholpur districts have decided to hold ‘mahapanchayats’ at different places to discuss the course of action to get reservations in government jobs and educational institutions.The first of these meetings will be held in Bharatpur district’s Pathena village on November 18.“We will hold ‘mahapanchayats’ at different locations starting November 18 and take a decision. If the government wants to hear us through agitations, then we will do a ‘chakka jam’ after a decision taken in the ‘mahapanchayats’,” Jat Aarakshan Sangarsh Samiti convener Nem Singh Faujdar said.The state government should recommend to the Centre to give Jats of these two districts reservation in the Central OBC list, he said, adding that Jats of other districts of the state have already got quota.The Jats of Bharatpur and Dholpur districts were excluded from the Central OBC (other backward classes) list after a March 2015 Supreme Court order, and then from the state OBC list following a Rajasthan High Court ruling in August that year.In 2017, the Vasundhara Raje-led government had extended reservation to Jats of these two districts under the state OBC list, but they are yet to be included in the central list.The Muslim Minority Development Committee (MMDC), which has written to Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on the reservation issue, has demanded 10 per cent quota for backward Muslim castes.“Muslim OBCs fare worse than other OBCs in education and social backwardness. Separate reservation for Muslim OBCs in education and services should be given in the state on the lines of Karnataka,” MMDC secretary general Yunus Ali Khan said.The Delhi-Mumbai rail route in Bayana’s Pilupura and Hindaun-Bayana road has been blocked by members of the Gurjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti over reservation for the community.The organisation is demanding that the Rajasthan government should get the Gurjar reservation included in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, fill the backlog of vacancies and give the benefit of five per cent reservation to the Most Backward Classes (MBCs) in the pending recruitment process.

But it is unfortunate that there have been repeated efforts to unnecessarily bring bilateral issues in the SCO agenda which is in violation of the SCO spirit,” Modi said.Referring to COVID-19, Modi said India will use its capacity in production and distribution of vaccines to help the entire humanity in fighting the pandemic.In this difficult time of unprecedented epidemic, India’s pharma industry sent essential medicines to over 150 countries, he said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-sco-summit-pm-modi-asks-china-pakistan-to-respect-indias-sovereignty-territorial-integrity-168784

I don't think anybody should light any firecrackers, but lot of diyas," Sayani Gupta says in the ad released across social media platforms last Thursday.However, a section of social media users took offence at the "advice" to avoid firecrackers during Diwali."Why should anyone advise Hindus how to celebrate Our Festivals? Companies must focus on selling their products, not lecture us to refrain from bursting Crackers," BJP National General Secretary C T Ravi tweeted.Sources said the 50-second ad has been withdrawn from Twitter and YouTube, but continues to be on the company's Instagram page.When contacted, the company did not offer any comments on the matter.This comes within a month of Tanishq pulling down an ad featuring an inter-faith couple after being trolled by some netizens.

10-11-2020||New Delhi||2 held for preparing fake Aadhaar, voter ID cards||Two men were arrested for allegedly preparing fake Aadhaar and voter ID cards for a gang of cheats by using forged documents, police said on Tuesday.Umesh Chander (29) and Ravi Sachdeva (36) were arrested from Mangolpuri and Burari respectively after several raids on Saturday, they said.According to police, the arrest was made by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police in connection with a case registered by it on a complaint by a private bank, which alleged that the gang of cheats had procured several credit as well as debit cards from it using forged documents.On November 4, eight members of the gang were arrested in the case by the EOW and hundreds of credit and debit cards, PAN cards, Aadhaar cards, cash and jewellery were also recovered from their possession.Joint Commissioner of Police (EOW) Dr OP Mishra said during interrogation, the gang members revealed that Chander and Sachdeva prepared PAN cards, Aadhaar cards and voter IDs on the basis of forged documents, for them to obtain credit and debit cards from various banks.Later, Chander and Sacheva were also arrested, he said.The officer said Chander used to work as an operator in a firm authorised for processing data for preparation of Aadhaar cards.He was well aware about the entire process of preparing Aadhaar cards.Subsequently, he opened his own office in Mangolpuri and worked as an agent for firms which were authorised by Aadhaar authorities for preparing the cards."The gang of cheats had approached Chander for preparing different Aadhar cards by using photographs of the same person. Since biometrics such as fingerprints and Iris are necessary for preparing each Aadhaar card, Chander used biometrics, ridges of feet of the same person for preparing two different Aadhaar cards. He also used fingerprints and Iris of minors and others who did not have their biometric with Aadhaar authority," the senior officer said.Chander and his accomplice Sachdeva later used these Aadhaar cards for preparing PAN cards and voter ID cards.They charged Rs 5,000-10,000 for each of these fake PAN cards or Voter ID cards and Rs 25,000 for each Aadhaar card, Mishra said.Police have seized a printer machine, two laptops, one Cogent IRIS Scanner Model and some papers from the office of the accused.

10-11-2020||Bengaluru||Indian researchers working towards developing effective vaccine strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and HIV||Indian Institute of Science claimed on Tuesday that researchers led by Raghavan Varadarajan, Professor at IISc's Molecular Biophysics Unit, are working towards developing effective vaccine strategies against two viruses: SARS-CoV-2 and HIV.In two studies published in the past week, they reported the design of a 'heat-tolerant' COVID-19 vaccine candidate and a rapid method to identify specific regions on the HIV envelopeprotein that are targeted by antibodies, which can help design effective vaccines, an IISc press release said.The studies were published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences respectively, according to Bengaluru-based IISc.The COVID-19 vaccine candidate contains a part of the spike protein of the novel coronavirus called the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD)—the region that helps the virus stick to the hosts cell.It is being developed by Varadarajans lab in collaboration with Mynvax, a startup co-founded by him and incubated at IISc, as well as several other institutes."When tested in guinea pig models, the vaccine candidate triggered a strong immune response", the statement said."Surprisingly, it also remained stable for a month at 37C, and freeze-dried versions could tolerate temperatures as high as 100C.Such 'warm' vaccines can be stored and transported without expensive cooling equipment to remote areas for mass vaccination - most vaccines need to be stored between 2-8C or even cooler temperatures to avoid losing their potency", it said.Compared to newer types such as mRNA vaccines, making a protein-based vaccine like this can also be scaled up easily in India where manufacturers have been making similar vaccines for decades, IISc said.There is another difference between the vaccine candidate being developed by Varadarajans team and many other COVID-19 vaccines in the works: it only uses a specific part of the RBD, a string of 200 amino acids, instead of the entire spike protein.The team inserted genes coding for this part via a carrier DNA molecule called a plasmid, into mammalian cells, which then churned out copies of the RBD section.They found that the RBD formulation was just as good as the full spike protein in triggering an immune response in guinea pigs, but much more stable at high temperatures for extended periods - the full spike protein quickly lost its activity at temperatures above 50C, according to the statement."Now we have to get funds to take this forward to clinical development, says Varadarajan.This would include safety and toxicity studies in rats along with process development and GMP manufacture of a clinical trial batch, before they are tested in humans."Those studies can cost about Rs 10 crore. Unless the government funds us, we might not be able to take it forward", he added.The second study focused on HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, a disease for which there is no vaccine despite decades of research.The team, which included researchers from multiple institutes, sought to pinpoint which parts of the HIVs envelope protein are targeted by neutralising antibodies - the ones that actually block virus entry into cells, not just flag it for other immune cells to find.According to the authors, vaccines based on these regions might induce a better immune response. To map such regions, researchers use methods like X-ray crystallography and cryo- electron microscopy, but these are time-consuming, complicated and expensive.Therefore, Varadarajan and his team explored alternative approaches, and eventually arrived at a simpler, yet effective solution.First, they mutated the virus so that an amino acid called cysteine would pop up in several places on the envelope protein. They then added a chemical label that would stick to these cysteine molecules, and finally, treated the virus with neutralising antibodies.If the antibodies could not bind to crucial sites on the virus because they were blocked by the cysteine label, the virus could survive and cause infection.Those sites were then identified by sequencing the genes of the surviving mutant viruses."This is a rapid way of figuring out where antibodies are binding and is useful for vaccine design," says Varadarajan.It could also help in simultaneously testing how different peoples sera samples—the portions of their blood containing antibodies—react to the same vaccine candidate or virus, he says."In principle, researchers could adapt this methodology to any virus, including SARS-CoV-2", he said.

10-11-2020||New Delhi||Bihar vote count likely to continue till late in the night: EC||The Election Commission has said that 2.7 crore EVM votes have been counted until 5:30 pm, out of which 4 crore were cast in Bihar assembly polls.  However, counting of votes for the Bihar assembly elections will take longer than usual and continue till late in the night because of 63 per cent increase in the number of EVMs, the Election Commission said on Tuesday asserting that the pace of counting of votes is not slow.Briefing reporters in the national capital as the counting progressed in Bihar, EC officials said over 1 crore votes were counted till around 1.30 pm out of nearly 4.16 crore votes polled in the three-phase elections. Out of nearly 7.3 crore voters, 57.09 per cent had cast votes in the polls.An official said the counting has been "glitch-free" so far.To ensure social distancing norms put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the commission had increased the number of polling stations from nearly 65,000 in the 2015 assembly polls to 1.06 lakh. This meant an increase in the number of electronic voting machines as well.This time, the EC has restricted the number of voters per polling station to 1,000 from 1,500 to maintain physical distancing, thus increasing the number of polling stations."We hope to finish the counting as per procedure late tonight," said Deputy Election Commissioner in charge of Bihar Chandra Bhushan Kumar.He said in the 2015 assembly polls, counting was held in 38 locations. But to ensure distancing norms, this time, counting is being held at 55 locations.Responding to a question, Kumar said the number of EVMs deployed have increased. Also the number of postal ballots have used. The Commission has taken steps keeping in mind these."There is no question of the pace of counting being slow," he said. The number of tables used per hall has been reduced to seven from the usual 14. But 14 tables have been put in place, though locations and as a result locations have increased.Bhushan said the number of rounds for counting varies between 19 and 51 in different constituencies. The average come to approximately 35 rounds.Responding to a query on some people questioning the reliability of EVMs, Deputy Election Commissioner in charge of EVMs Sudip Jain said the machines are "absolutely tamper-proof" and the Supreme Court has upheld the use of the device on multiple occasions.One control unit and at least ballot unit make for one EVM.

10-11-2020||Mumbai||'Nobody scared of Dawood Ibrahim': 6 properties of don auctioned in Maharashtra||At least 6 properties belonging to absconding mafia don Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar in Maharashtra's Ratnagiri were auctioned for nearly Rs 23 lakh under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act (SAFEMA), an official said on Tuesday.The successful bidders include lawyer Ajay Shrivastava who bought two properties and Supreme Court advocate Bhupendra Bhardwaj who picked up four assets in the scheduled online, offline and sealed tender auction held here.The smooth auction held on Tuesday—coming after a similar one last year—indicated that the Pakistan-based fugitive don is no longer a much-dreaded criminal here.A majority of the properties are small constructions—some in a bad shape—on plots of land, situated in Mumbake village in Khed sub-district of Ratnagiri, from where the Kaskar family hailed."We got excellent response for the auction. The six properties at Ratnagiri have been successfully sold. Four bids were won by Bhardwaj and two others by Shrivastava," a beaming Additional Commissioner, SAFEMA, R.N. D'Souza told media persons post-auction.According to D'Souza, the bids for two of the properties on the block went much above their reserve prices—Rs 1.89 lakh (sold at Rs 5.35 lakh), and Rs 4.30 lakh (sold for Rs 11.20 lakh)—while the other properties went for the base prices.One property of the fugitive don originally scheduled to be auctioned, was withdrawn owing to certain technicalities, he added.However, two flats at Milton Apartments in Mumbai's Santacruz west, belonging to former Dawood aide Iqbal Memon alias Iqbal Mirchi, were also put up on auction simultaneously, but despite many enquiries for these prime properties, there were no bids.Explaining the procedure, D'Souza said that 25 percent of the bid amount must be deposited within a week, another 25 percent within a month, and the balance within one to three months.After the complete payment is made, the buyer would be issued a confirmation letter by the SAFEMA finalising the deal.The competent authority under SAFEMA had planned to auction off all 13 seized properties of the fugitive don early this year, but the plans were postponed in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown.In April 2019, the SAFEMA had auctioned a 600 square feet flat at Gordon Hall Apartments in Nagpada owned by the don's deceased sister Haseena Parkar for Rs 1.80 crore.After her death in 2014, it was occupied by her brother Iqbal Kaskar, who was arrested by Thane police in 2017 in several extortion cases and is currently in prison.In 2018, the SAFEMA auctioned another of Dawood's property in Amina Mansion in south Mumbai which was picked up by the Saifee Burhani Upliftment Trust (SBUT) for Rs 3.51 crore against the reserve price of Rs 79.50 lakh.Prior to this in November 2017, the SAFEMA had sold, by auction, six flats in south Mumbai, the Shabnam Guest House and the Raunaq Afroz Restaurant for a total of over Rs 11.50 crore.

10-11-2020||New Delhi||Adversaries may take advantage if we do not have strong armed forces: Gen Rawat||The Indian armed forces are operating in a very complex, and uncertain environment, and they must continue to enhance capabilities for peace in the region as India's adversaries may take advantage if its military power is not strong, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat said on Tuesday.He also said that India wants to share its military capabilities with friendly countries in the neighbourhood and the extended neighbourhood as well as to those who need its support.The Chief of Defence Staff was speaking at the inaugural session of the fifth annual conclave of the Bharatshakti.in, a portal on defence and military issues."We are today operating in a very complex, uncertain and a very volatile environment. There are small and big battles raging nearly in every region of the world. Therefore, we all need strong armed forces if we have to defend ourselves, defend our nation, defend the integrity of our nation and the safety and security of our people," Gen Rawat said."But, then are we saying that armed forces must prepare for war? No. The armed forces must develop capabilities to bring about peace in the region. If we do not have strong armed forces, the adversary will take advantage of us," he said.Gen Rawat's comments came in the midst of an over six-month border standoff between India and China in eastern Ladakh that has significantly strained their ties. Both sides held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the row. However, no concrete breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff.In a message, which was read out at the conclave, Prime Minister Narendra Modi cited various reform initiatives rolled out by the government in the defence sector to produce modern equipment and harness new technology as well as to infuse better synergy among the armed forces."We are marching ahead with the nation's collective resolve to build a modern and self reliant India. Our resoluteness gets reflected in an unprecedented spirit of self-confidence in the defence sector today," Modi said.The prime minister said a self-reliant India is a "win-win resolve" for all the stakeholders, as this vision is for world peace and a resilient global economy."From private and public sectors to foreign partners, all would get strength from India's vibrant strategic ecosystem," he said.In his address, Gen Rawat also spoke about challenges being faced by the armed forces operating in difficult challenging environments including in jungles, deserts and terrains ranging from 6000 to 6500 metres in altitude."Our navy operates in Indo-Pacific, an area which witnesses the largest concentration of white shipping. They have to develop technologies not only to operate on the surface but below the surface of the ocean as well in an environment which is becoming increasingly complex," the Chief of Defence Staff said.He said the Indian armed forces need capabilities that no other armed forces in the world will perhaps require due to varied challenges and environment. Therefore, Gen Rawat said the kind of technology India is developing and the weapons systems that can find their way into the Indian inventory will be second to none."We are not hesitant in inviting foreign collaborators who can support our industry, hand-hold them and move on...We also want to share the capabilities with the other armed forces around the globe, particularly in the neighbourhood and extended neighbourhood," Gen Rawat said."We are willing to support those who need our support, especially those nations which are also going through troubled times and looking at good weapons systems," he said in presence of defence officials of several foreign countries.Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said the threat by India's adversaries is 'deep and long term'.

10-11-2020||Patna||Hope, disappointment as early trends show NDA ahead of Grand Alliance in Bihar||With the Bihar poll trends showing the ruling NDA marching ahead of the RJD-led Grand Alliance, the mood was buoyant among BJP and JD(U) workers, but RJD and Congress activists looked disappointed, even though hoping for things to change in their favour. At the BJP office at Beer Chand Patel Path, where there was not much activity for the past three days after exit polls projected a majority for the Grand Alliance, several leaders and party workers have started coming in with beaming faces. State BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal is in the office monitoring the results closely.Bihar BJP spokesman Sanjay Singh Tiger said the BJP-JD(U) coalition has worked under the "double engine" governments -- NDA dispensations at the Centre as well in the state – and the people of Bihar have blessed it."The people know Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish kumar can speed up the development of the state and hence they have reposed their faith in the NDA," Tiger told reporters.While Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is watching counting of votes at his official residence, some leaders and party workers have started thronging the party office, a stone's throw away from the office of the BJP and the RJD in the heart of the city.Bihar JD(U) president Vasistha Narayan Singh said they were confident since the beginning that the people of the state would like the ruling coalition to continue and expedite the development process.Asked about the BJP performing better than the JD(U) and if Chief Minister Kumar will continue in the post, Singh said, "When top BJP leaders themselves have said that Kumar will be the CM irrespective of the individual scores of the alliance partners, is there any need to clarify this further?" JD(U) spokesman Ajay Alok said the people of Bihar have faith in Nitish Kumar and that is reflected in the trends in favour of the NDA.In the RJD camp, which was on cloud nine till Monday with almost all exit polls indicating the party-helmed coalition coming to power in the state and its leader Tejashwi Yadav becoming chief minister, the initial euphoria appears to be dipping.A crowd of Tejashwi supporters that had gathered outside the 10 Circular Road residence of former chief minister Rabri Devi expecting a victory is thinning now.But some ardent supporters, carrying photographs of Tejashwi in Delhi Daredevils jersey from his IPL days and also him taking oath as CM, stay put in the hope that things will change for better with the progress of counting.Bihar RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari said, "It's like a T-20 match. The result will be decided only when the last ball of the match is bowled." In the Congress camp, initial excitement appears to have evaporated with the trends showing Grand Alliance trailing the NDA.Scores of Congress leaders from across the country, including its general secretary Randeep Surjewala, who have arrived here in the hope of party forming a government with Mahagathbandhan partners are glued to TV channels hoping the trends will change in accordance to the exit polls."We are not far behind, things will change in our favour," state Congress spokesman Rajesh Rathore told PTI.

10-11-2020||New Delhi||Big Covid spike feared as 39 lakh people may travel home by bus for Diwali||With the festival of lights approaching, the nation seems determined to make it a family affair this year, evident from the high volume of intercity bus ticket bookings registered so far on redBus, Indias largest online bus ticketing platform.The booking for Diwali on redBus has already started 15 days in advance before the festival on November 14.About 1,900 plus Private Bus Operators and 17 State Regional Transport Corporations are gearing up to cater to the year's peak travel days by running around 40,000 daily services, through which they are expected to transport 39 lakh passengers, across thousands of kilometers during the Diwali week.Data from redBus so far indicates that travel between Chennai and Madurai, is the nation's most sought after bus route, for Diwali. It also indicates that the highest demand for travel is coming from Chennai across India.With railways continuing to operate limited trains across the nation, buses tend to be the only hope for lakhs of people to spend the festival with their families. Some of the popular train routes of the country where the demand is being met by buses are Patna-Kolkata, Ballia-Lucknow, Palasa-Visakhapatnam, Berhampore-Kolkata and Bhubaneswar-Kolkata.About 60 per cent of the current bookings are for travel within states and the remaining 40 per cent for interstate travel. 58 per cent of the current bookings have been made on Air-Conditioned buses.The top 5 states where redBus is witnessing high demand for travel are Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Gujarat.A behavioural shift that has been evident post-Covid is the preference for online bus booking going up. This has gained traction lately due to the safety and convenience aspects associated with it, compared to offline modes of ticket purchase. Another interesting trend from the beginning of the festive season has been a surge in travel to tier 2 and 3 cities and towns, resulting in them contributing 80 per cent of current bookings (up from 65 per cent last year), a clear indication that a majority of the people are travelling to their home towns during the festival.For Diwali this year, the shortest intercity bus route booked in the country is between Guwahati and Machkhowa in Assam, covering a distance of 4.9 kilometres in 20 minutes and the longest is between Jodhpur and Mysore, between Rajasthan and Karnataka, covering a distance of 1,965 kilometers in 38 hours.Safety continues to be an important factor under consideration during the festive rush, with redBus strictly adhering to laid guidelines, applicable to both bus operators and travellers, under its Safety plus programme.Accordingly, all passengers and crew are required to wear masks while travelling, with facilities for hand sanitization offered within the vehicle. Temperature checks will be undertaken at boarding and no linen will be provided by operators. Buses will be sanitized after each trip in accordance with established guidelines.Speaking on the occasion, Prakash Sangam, CEO, redBus, said, "We are experiencing a big recovery in travel sentiment as many travellers are making the journey to their hometowns for Diwali. Usually the festive season with Eid, Dussehra and Diwali is a peak travel period and in this difficult year that has witnessed many travel restrictions due to Covid-19, it is extremely encouraging to see the festive season contributing towards the revival in travel. As bus travellers look to resume travelling after the complete lifting of all restrictions, redBus and our bus operator partners are committed to providing them with a safe and comfortable travel experience. We expect intercity bus travel to remain in demand for the rest of the festive season and beyond as bus travel steadily returns to normalcy."  IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/big-covid-spike-feared-as-39-lakh-people-may-travel-home-by-bus-for-diwali-168754
10-11-2020||Bhopal/Lucknow/Ahmedabad||BJP leads in 39 of 59 Assembly bypolls; ahead on 19 seats in MP, 8 in Gujarat, five in UP||It was advantage BJP on Tuesday with the party leading in 39 seats as votes were counted for Assembly by-elections in 59 constituencies across 11 states, including Madhya Pradesh where it was ahead in 19 seats, according to the Election Commission website.The country's ruling party was also ahead in all the eight seats in Gujarat for which by-elections were held and six in Uttar Pradesh, where seven Assembly constituencies went to the polls in the first pan-India electoral exercise since the pandemic.Counting for the voting held on November 3 began at 8 am and progressed in accordance with the Election Commission's guidelines restricting the number of people in counting halls, officials said. Extensive measures were taken to ensure social distancing.Votes were also counted for by-elections in Manipur (five seats), Haryana (one), Chhattisgarh (one), Jharkhand (two), Karnataka (two), Nagaland (two), Odisha (two) and Telangana (one).Madhya PradeshIt's a high-stakes electoral battle, particularly in Madhya Pradesh where the BJP-led Shivraj Singh Chouhan government is locked in a fierce contest with the Congress to save its government. The BJP had an edge here---at 5:45 pm, it had won five seats and was ahead in 14.The Congress was leading in eight, and the BSP in one, according to Election Commission trends.Elections were held for 28 seats, the first time that so many by-elections were held together. The BJP which has 107 MLAs in the assembly, with an effective strength of 229, needs at least eight more MLAs for a simple majority.It is a crucial test for Jyotiraditya Scindia, who quit the Congress with his loyalist MLAs to join the BJP, toppling the Congress-led Kamal Nath government. Elsewhere, the leads for the BJP varied from a little over 300 (Dabra) to more than 17,000 (Badnawar).GujaratThe BJP held sway over the party-ruled state with leads in all eight seats and the Congress trailing. A total of 60.75 per cent voter turnout was recorded in the bypolls held in Abdasa (Kutch), Limbdi (Surendranagar), Morbi (Morbi district), Dhari (Amreli), Gadhada (Botad), Karjan (Vadodara), Dang (Dang district) and Kaprada (Valsad).Uttar PradeshOf the seven seats, the ruling BJP was ahead in five and the Samajwadi Party in two. Eighty-eight candidates contested in the Naugaon Sadat, Tundla, Bangarmau, Bulandshahr, Deoria, Ghatampur and Malhani seats. Barring Malhani, which was with the SP, the other seats were in the ruling BJP's kitty. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav alleged on Monday that the BJP was involved in "rigging”.ManipurBharatiya Janata Party took four of five seats that went to polls---Wangoi, Wangjing Tentha, Saitu and Singhat. An independent candidate, Y Antas Khan---a candidate supporteted by the BJP---won the fifth, Lilong. The by-elections were necessitated by four Congress MLAs resigning from the Assembly and quitting the party to join the BJP.The BJP contested in three seats and supported an Independent candidate in Lilong, while the Congress fielded its nominees in all the four constituencies.KarnatakaThe BJP had the edge in both the seats for which elections were held. Though the results will have no bearing on the stability of the BS Yediyurappa government, it would be seen in many quarters as a reflection on its performance, especially during the pandemic.Of the two seats that went to the polls, one was with the JD(S) and the other with the Congress. The elections were necessitated by the death of Sira JD(S) MLA B Satyanarayana in August and the resignation of RR Nagar Congress MLA Munirathna from the assembly last year.Jharkhand          The Indian National Congress was ahead in one seat and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha on the other. JMM's Basant Soren,  Chief Minister Hemant Soren's brother, was leading in Dumka. In Bermo, Congress nominee Anup Singh was ahead of BJP's Yogeshwar Mahato.OdishaThe state's ruling Biju Janata Dal was ahead in both the Balasore and Tirtol seats for which by-elections were held. While state BJP general secretary Prithviraj Harichandan had claimed his party will win both as voters were "fed up with the ruling party”, BJD leader DP Mishra said people voted as they are keen to see speedy development in their areas.ChhattisgarhThe state's ruling Congress was ahead in the by-election to the Marwahi seat that was necessitated due to the death of Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) MLA and former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi.NagalandNationalist Democratic Progressive Party's Medo Yhokha won Southern Angami-I in Kohima---one of the two assembly seats that went to polls. An independent candidate, T Yangseo Sangtam, was leading in the second seat, Pungro-Kiphire in Kiphire district. The elections were necessitated following the deaths of the sitting legislators Vikho-o Yhoshu and T Torechu.TelanganaThe BJP was leading in the Dubbak Assembly constituency, which witnessed a three-cornered contest between the ruling TRS and opposition BJP and Congress.The bypolls were called due to the death of sitting TRS MLA Solipeta Ramalinga Reddy in August this year. His widow Solipeta Sujatha was the ruling party's choice. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-leads-in-39-of-59-assembly-bypolls-ahead-on-19-seats-in-mp-8-in-gujarat-five-in-up-168753
10-11-2020||Washington||Restoration of India's GSP status, a small Indo-US trade deal to send very strong signal: Aghi||Restoration of India's Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) status by US President-elect Joe Biden and Washington quickly closing a small trade deal with it would send a very strong signal to New Delhi, according to the head of a top India-centric American business advocacy group.In an interview to PTI, Mukesh Aghi, President of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF), said that India and the US should close a small trade deal as a quick win and start focusing on the bigger issues.Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal in September said most issues preventing a limited trade deal between India and the United States have been resolved and an agreement could be signed anytime the political situation in the US allows it.India is seeking exemption from high duties imposed by the US on some steel and aluminium products, resumption of export benefits to certain domestic products under the GSP, and greater market access for its products from sectors such as agriculture, automobile, automobile components and engineering.On the other hand, the US wants greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, dairy items and medical devices, apart from a cut in import duties on some information and communication technology products.President Donald Trump last year terminated India's designation as a beneficiary developing nation under the key GSP trade programme after determining that it has not assured the US that it will provide “equitable and reasonable access” to its markets.“I think we have a small (India-US) trade deal on the table. (They) should just close that as a quick win. And then start focusing on the bigger issues. To me, that's a positive sign. I think a restoration of GSP will send a very strong signal to the Government of India that this administration knows to do business with India,” Aghi said.As vice president of the US from 2009 to 2017, Biden among other things had emphasised on increasing trade relationships between the two countries. In fact, he had set an ambitious goal of increasing the bilateral trade to USD 500 billion at a time when it was around USD 100 billion per annum. Five years later, the trade now is USD 150 billion per annum.Kicking off the relationship with a small trade deal and restoration of GSP, which was revoked by the outgoing Trump administration, will be helpful, he said.The GSP is the largest and oldest US trade preference programme and is designed to promote economic development by allowing duty-free entry for thousands of products from designated beneficiary countries.Under the programme, nearly 2,000 products including auto components and textile materials can enter the US duty-free if the beneficiary developing countries meet the eligibility criteria established by Congress.India was the largest beneficiary of the programme in 2017 with USD 5.7 billion in imports to the US given duty-free status.“I also strongly believe that the defence collaboration is very strong (and), is moving in the right direction,” Aghi said.According to the USISPF chief, a Biden-Harris administration will neither be transactional nor Twitter-based but would be based on mutual respect and long-term vision.While the momentum will continue on the political side, the QUAD effort will continue, he said, adding that there would be greater collaboration happening on the economic front as well.In November 2017, India, Japan, the US and Australia gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the "Quad" to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.It's not just about a trade deal, it's about de-risking the supply chain with China, which is likely to get more confrontational in the coming months. India can play a much stronger role, he said.Aghi said issues like Kashmir and minority rights will be discussed.They would be discussed, but keeping the bigger picture in mind they would not be showstoppers, he said.Aghi, who has been providing inputs to the transition team on India-US relationship, said that the Biden administration is likely to focus on a trade deal just to show a quick win.He also expects a multilateral approach wherein the US would work with India on a host of global issues like climate change, energy security and environment.“I think you'll see a much more structural approach happening between the two countries,” he said.Responding to a question on achieving the ambitious goal of USD 500 billion in bilateral trade, Aghi underscored the need to remove impediments in growth in trade, focusing more on energy partnership and supply chain, and leveraging India on 5G.It is also important to focus on increasing the number of students coming to the US to 500,000. Vaccine diplomacy could be another area of collaboration wherein India can help produce vaccines at a low cost, he said.Of the view that there will be a much stronger collaboration between the US and India on Indo-Pacific region, Aghi said he wouldn't be surprised if the Biden administration revives TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) and encourages India to look at that.President Donald Trump in 2017 formally pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation trade deal, one of the major international trade initiatives of his predecessor Barack Obama.

10-11-2020||New Delhi||Smog may worsen in Delhi-NCR coming days due to weather conditions: Experts||While directions of the NGT and the newly-appointed CAQM are expected to bring some relief to Delhi-NCR residents struggling with toxic smog, meteorologists are not expecting any immediate help from the weather conditions either in the form of strong winds or rains in the next seven to 10 days. Rather, they fear the situation may worsen with winds changing direction in the next couple of days.Mahesh Palawat from Skymet says “winds will remain light and calm for next two to three days. The first strong Western Disturbance is expected around November 12. This will lead to the formation of a cyclonic circulation over Northern plains (Punjab and Haryana) and change in direction of winds from Northwest to Southeast, adding more humidity in the air and existing smog-conducive factors like light winds and pollutants, ” he says.There is a possibility of rain in Delhi-NCR around November 15 and 16.“However, only if rains are moderate to intense, pollutants will be washed away, light rains will add to factors building pollution. Besides adjoining States also have to impose ban strongly”, he saysDeadly smog is the ritual Delhi-NCR runs every year after the withdrawal of Southwest Monsoon from the region. However, it is not as if the air is good in other parts of the year. Experts say that Delhi, and many other cities, have air with SPM many notches above accepted levelsSo far as the yearly smog is concerned, experts say it is "complex issue" requiring a coordinated effort from all States throughout the yearApart from usual suspects like the burning of biodegradable mass, for which not just Punjab, Haryana and their 'parali' is responsible, Delhi-NCR also contributes equally to this section. Besides air has no boundaries, so activity in one area can impact a far-off region due to wind conditionsDelhi-NCR has additional issues like the multi-storied and congested Delhi-NCR trapping every bit of pollution emerging from a combination of stubble burning and local factors like upla/biomass and waste burning, vehicular pollution and construction activities adding with the still/low wind conditions. This year temperature too dropped early adding to the build-up.Amid rising Covid-19 cases and pollution levels, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) yesterday imposed a complete ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the Delhi-NCR region from midnight till the end of the month (November 30)In Delhi, State Environment Minister Gopal Rai said action will be taken against those not complying with the ban on firecrackers under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act which invites a jail term of up to six years and a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh.The newly-appointed Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and adjoining Areas stressed on the need to strictly enforce existing laws, rules, guidelines, directions and standard operating procedures to minimise air pollution on an emergency basis. There should be strict implementation of “extant rules, Courts and Tribunal orders regarding stubble burning and use of firecrackers,” it said, calling for active public participation and identifying 10 immediate measures, including restricting travel and work from homeThe NGT also directed all states and union territories to initiate drives to contain air pollution from all sources in view of the potential of aggravation of Covid-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/smog-may-worsen-in-delhi-ncr-coming-days-due-to-weather-conditions-experts-168745
10-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi-NCR's air quality on brink of 'emergency'||Delhi woke up to a grey morning as an apocalyptic smog blotted out the sun from the sky and smudged landmarks from view with air quality inching closer to “emergency” levels on Tuesday.Air quality monitoring stations at Mandir Marg, Punjabi Bagh, Pusa, Rohini, Patparganj, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Najafgarh, Sri Aurobindo Marg and Okhla Phase 2 maxed out – as air quality indexes hit the 500 mark, Central Pollution Control Board data showed.The smog reduced the visibility to merely 300 meters in the morning affecting traffic, an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Delhi recorded an AQI of 487 at 9 am, which falls in the “severe” category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (474), Ghaziabad (476), Noida (490), Greater Noida (467), and Gurugram (469) also recorded “severe” air quality.This is the sixth “severe” air day on the trot in Delhi. The city witnessed seven “severe” air days in November last year.The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – in Delhi-NCR were 605 µg/m3 at 8 am – around ten times the safe limit of 60 µg/m3.                PM10 levels stood at 777 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 8 am, the highest since November June 14, 2018, when it surged to 847 µg/m3, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.If PM2.5 and PM10 levels are more than 300 µg/m3 and 500 µg/m3 for over 48 hours, emergency measures such ban on construction activities, entry of trucks and car rationing scheme can be implemented under the Graded Response Action Plan for Delhi-NCR notified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2017.Government agencies and experts said calm wind speeds were exacerbating the effect of stubble burning and a “quick recovery” is not possible unless the number of farm fires reduces drastically.V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environment research centre, said a major improvement in Delhi-NCR's air quality was highly unlikely in the coming days. “The air quality is likely to be recorded in the upper end of the ''very poor'' category on Diwali if we discount firecrackers emissions. If people burst crackers, pollution levels can increase to 'severe'' to 'severe plus' category (emergency),” he said.The National Green Tribunal on Monday imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases".The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said, “Low dispersion condition continues in Delhi along with high fire-related intrusion. This has led to the accumulation of pollutants near the surface.”      “No quick recovery is expected unless a drastic reduction in fire counts takes place,” it said.SAFAR said the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was 38 percent on Monday.According to the IMD, Delhi recorded calm winds and a minimum temperature of 10.8 degrees Celsius on Tuesday morning. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.There was moderate fog in the morning which led to smog. It reduced visibility to 300 meters at the Safdarjung and Palam weather stations, an IMD official said.The newly-constituted Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas on Monday stressed the need to enforce existing laws, directions and SOPs to minimise air pollution on an emergency basis. It is expected to review the situation on Tuesday.Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said action will be taken against those not complying with the ban on firecrackers under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act which included a jail term of up to six years.

10-11-2020||Patna||Bihar elections: RJD emerges single largest party but NDA maintains slender lead||Bihar assembly elections looked too close to call Tuesday night with the ruling NDA maintaining a slender edge over the RJD-led Grand alliance, winning 81 seats and leading in 41 others.By 10:00 pm, the RJD, the opposition alliance’s spearhead, overtook the BJP at the top of the table, with 77 seats---clinching 50 seats and leading in 27 others. The BJP's number stands just under at 72---the party has 46 seats and is leading in 26.NDA partner JD (U) has won 28 seats and is leading in 14---a major backslide for the party that had won 71 seats when it fought the 2015 assembly polls in alliance with the RJD. The VIP has won three seats and is leading in one more, while the HAM has won four seats.The NDA has won or is leading in 122 seats---exactly the halfway mark needed to make government. The  Grand Alliance is nine seats behind in his very close battle---the alliance has won 72 seats and is leading in 41 more. RJD’s co-traveller, the Congress, has won 10 seats and leads one eight. Allies CPI-M has won two seats, CPI has won one and leading on two and CPI-ML has won nine and is leading in three.Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM is emerging as a surprise package, winning three seats and leading in two others. It had won a seat in a by-election in Bihar earlier, but appears to be making significant inroads in the Seemanchal region which has a large presence of Muslim voters.Given his aversion to the BJP, Owaisi could be more than willing to lend a helping hand to the Grand Alliance if it falls short of a majority by a few seats.The LJP, down in the dumps having pulled a blank these elections, appeared to have contributed its bit to the unimpressive showing of the JD(U), damaging its prospects in at least 30 seats, according to the latest trends.Chirag Paswan’s party, which walked out of the NDA in Bihar just ahead of the poll, is set to fare abysmally as it has neither won nor is leading in any seat despite polling 5.63 per cent of the 2.70 crore votes counted so far.JD (U) spokesperson KC Tyagi told PTI in New Delhi that a “sinister” campaign was run against Nitish Kumar as part of a “conspiracy”.“Apne bhi shamil the aur begane bhi (Our own also harmed us along with the outsiders),” he said, without taking any names.He, however, expressed confidence that Kumar will become the chief minister again, noting that top BJP leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have made it clear that he will head the government if the ruling NDA retains power.Bihar BJP president Sanjay Jaiswal voiced similar views in Patna when he said in Patna “the issue has been cleared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party chief J P Nadda much before the elections”.Senior Bihar minister Vijendra Prasad Yadav of JD (U) won from Supual, and Niraj Singh Babloo of the BJP, a cousin of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, whose mysterious death became an election issue, retained the Chhatapur seat.Also read: Bihar vote count likely to continue till late in the night: ECHAM president Jitan Ram Manjhi defeated former state assembly speaker Uday Narayan Chaudhary in Imamganj of Gaya district.Lesi Singh of the JD(U) won the Dhamdaha seat in Purnia district. It was while campaigning for her that Nitish Kumar had declared it was going to be the last election for him, making an emotional appeal to electors to vote the NDA back to power. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-elections-rjd-emerges-single-largest-party-but-nda-maintains-slender-lead-168733
10-11-2020||Vibha Sharma||Bihar set for D-day amid predictions of change||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 9Amid encouraging exit poll predictions favouring RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav-led mahagathbandhan, key state Bihar is set to deliver tomorrow a verdict on what is being called the test of the “mood of the nation”.The election is the first test for NDA-led Centre and Prime Minister Narendra Modi since the Covid-19 pandemic struck. It also tests the political worth of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar fighting his most difficult elections in the backdrop of 15-year anti-incumbency and gauntlet thrown down by LJP president Chirag Paswan.They have transcended local and state issues to become a measure of national sentiments, political observers say.Apart from the Covid-induced stresses like migrant, economic and job crisis, Bihar also polled amid the debate surrounding the contentious CAA, which many believe is one of the reasons for the BJP’s loss in Delhi.Launching its characteristic poll blitzkrieg, the BJP gave these elections all it had with PM Modi and party president JP Nadda leading from the front, making it more about Modi and BJP than Nitish Kumar, who remained bogged down by his own difficulties, including Chirag’s constant nagging. Political observers say Chirag could not have pulled such a big stunt without the BJP’s blessings.However, despite Chirag’s constant needling, the BJP threw its weight behind Nitish. PM Modi, who addressed around 12 rallies and fired all ammo in BJP’s arsenal.To divert attention from the 15-year incumbency faced by Nitish, the BJP made these elections into “Modi versus the rest” with some heavy dosage of nationalism and its anti-national rivals.Meanwhile, apart from decades-long political worth of Nitish, the day will also test Nadda as the BJP chief, who is yet to register an electoral victory for his party since he became the president.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-set-for-d-day-amid-predictions-of-change-168725

Since then, Ram Vilas always sided with the parties that opposed Kumar. In 2010, the LJP contested the election in alliance with Lalu Prasad’s RJD. In 2015, when Kumar switched sides to join hands with Lalu Prasad against the BJP, the LJP went with the saffron party. But on both occasions he failed to damage wily Nitish Kumar.Now, his son Chirag decided to go alone.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-exit-polls-hold-true-chirag-may-fulfil-fathers-wish-168726
10-11-2020||KV Prasad||MP bypoll results a battle of prestige for Jyotiraditya Scindia, Kamal Nath||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 9The results of the Madhya Pradesh bypoll will be watched with interest as a battle of prestige will be fought between former Chief Minister Kamal Nath and his challenger Jyotiraditya Scindia who is now with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The outcome in MP should make a difference to the political careers of the two leaders from the state — Nath and Scindia — both of whom were together in the Congress till recently. Scindia joined the Congress in 2001, stepping into the shoes of his father Madhavrao Scindia who was killed in a plane crash. Since then, the younger Scindia attempted to carve out a place for himself in national politics. After representing the Guna Lok Sabha constituency since 2001, he lost the 2019 polls to the BJP, a party he joined this year.The crossing over was more a message to the Congress of his unhappiness in ignoring his claims in the party or a larger role in MP. Belonging to the erstwhile royal family of Gwalior, there is more at stake for Scindia since a majority of 25 MLAs considered loyal to him resigned from the Kamal Nath government leading to its fall and the bypoll. A majority of these seats fall in the Gwalior-Chambal region where the Scindias traditionally had a major say.On the other side, Kamal Nath who got the job of the Chief Minister will be eager to prove that he still has the fire in him to deliver a decisive blow to the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government, which requires just nine MLAs to obtain a simple majority of 116 in a House of 230. After the exit of his 25 legislators, the Congress tally in the House stands at 87 with four Independents, two BSP and one SP legislator making up the rest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-bypoll-results-a-battle-of-prestige-for-jyotiraditya-scindia-kamal-nath-168727

He will have the same job tomorrow, should election results throw up a hung Assembly.Caught napping on many occasions in the past, including in Goa, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh, where the BJP managed to break its ranks, the Congress wants to stay in the game and even ahead of it this time.“With the BJP’s history of poaching, we do not want to leave anything to chance,” Congress veteran and working committee member Tariq Anwar said today.Reasons for the party’s over-preparedness are not far to seek. At stake tomorrow is not just Congress’ electoral might, but also former chief Rahul Gandhi’s political mettle.Rahul was the sole visible star campaigner for the Congress in the Bihar elections, appearing alongside RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav and urging voters to factor in economy, joblessness and farm distress while casting the ballot.Tomorrow is Rahul’s chance to show he can deliver alone.Party chief Sonia Gandhi is awaiting this outcome not just for Congress’ own revival, but also for snubbing an attempted intra-party challenge to the party’s Gandhi family by 23 leaders, who sought elections to party posts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-stake-today-rahuls-mettle-congs-might-168728
