20-11-2020||Kolkata||TMC stokes Bengali pride calls BJP ‘outsiders’, BJP hits back||Stoking Bengali pride, the ruling Trinamool Congress on Friday sought to project the upcoming West Bengal Assembly elections as a battle between the “outsiders” and the people of the state, drawing a sharp reaction from the BJP.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee during the day said some people visit the state before elections and leave making tall promises, but she stays by the side of people throughout the year.A minister in her Cabinet, Bratya Basu, was more direct in his attack, where he accused the saffron party of being “anti-Bengali” and  engaging “non-Bengali outsiders to dictate terms” to the people of the state.The BJP was quick to refute the charges as “baseless” and “sign of the TMC’s frustration fearing defeat”.Inaugurating a Chhath puja in the city, Banerjee said her government does not believe in only delivering speeches during polls.Without naming central BJP leaders who visited West Bengal in the recent past, Banerjee said, “There are some people who come to the state only before and during elections. They deliver long speeches and then leave soon afterwards. Unlike them, we stay with the public throughout the year, in every situation.”Basu, while addressing a press conference here, said the BJP was “anti—Bengali”, and that was the reason the party, which is in power at the Centre since 2014, has not appointed any Bengali as its Union Cabinet minister.There is no Cabinet berth for the West Bengal in Narendra Modi’s 2.0 government. There are two Ministers of State (MoS) from Bengal Babul Supriyo and Debasree Chaudhuri.“Outsiders who do not know Rabindranath Tagore are dictating terms to the people of the state. We had seen how violence perpetrated by them led to the desecration of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar’s bust (during May 2019 Lok Sabha polls campaign),” Basu commented.Noting that the people of the state would never accept the dominion of “non-Bengali outsiders”, Basu said, “History has shown any such attempt has never succeeded. This time, too, there will be no exception.”Basu, while talking about the BJP leaders deputed by the central leadership for Assembly polls, said Bengalis are being targeted and outsiders being sent to the state to do so.“They want to control us with the help of outsiders. Do we have to keep our heads down? Is this misery the fate of Bengalis?” he questioned.Rejecting the allegations, the BJP leadership said it would like to know if political strategist Prashant Kishor, appointed by the TMC to strengthen its poll prospects, is a “Bengali or non-Bengali”.“Our central leaders had come here to assist us and not to dictate terms. The TMC has been talking about outsiders... I want to ask the party whether Prashant Kishor is an insider. The TMC knows it will lose the assembly polls, that is why it has resorted to such tactics,” BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said.BJP national general secretary and in-charge of Bengal, Kailash Vijayvargiya had earlier said such comments reflect the frustration of the TMC over the growth of the saffron party in the state.“Such comments reflect the anger and frustration of the TMC and its leadership. It is laughable that people from other parts of the country are not welcome in the state, but Bangladeshi intruders are welcomed with open arms as they are the vote-bank of the TMC,” he said.Narratives themed around ‘Bengali pride’ and ‘natives versus outsiders’ are slowly gaining momentum, with various outfits raising the pitch for reservation for domicile Bengalis in jobs and education in the state, where, until a few years ago, cultural sub-nationalism was an alien concept.Subsequently, organisations such as Bangla Pokkho, Jatiyo Bangla Sammelan and Bangla Sanskriti Mancha emerged, accusing the BJP of trying to “impose Hindi and ‘north Indian culture’ on Bengal”.“BJP is the biggest threat to the Bengali culture and the Bengali identity. They don’t believe in capabilities of their Bengali leaders, and that is why they are importing leaders from other states,” Kaushik Maiti, senior leader, Bangla Pokkho, said.After having a limited presence in the politically polarised state for decades, the BJP has emerged as the main rival of the ruling Trinamool Congress by winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal in the 2019 general elections.With the BJP’s strength increasing in the state in the last few years, party leaders have exuded confidence that it will be able to end Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s 10-year rule in the 2021 assembly elections.Elections to the 294-member West Bengal Assembly are due in April-May next year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-stokes-bengali-pride-calls-bjp-outsiders-bjp-hits-back-173265

The riots unleashed by a violent mob left four people dead in police firing, while 60 police personnel too sustained injuries. Two police stations—K.G. Halli and D.J. Halli—and Murthy’s house were torched.A day prior to Raj’s arrest, the CCB police had arrested one of his associates named Riyazuddin on November 16.Just a week after the riots broke out, the CCB had arrested Raj’s personal assistant Arun Kumar on August 20.

He demanded that the top court should direct the Union Home Secretary to withdraw the Padma awards given to politicians and public servants referred to in the Vohra Committee report.Pointing out that the report had recommended a Nodal Cell to be set up with powers to take stringent action against crime syndicates, Upadhyay alleged that no follow-up action has been taken in the last 27 years.Noting that an incomplete version of the report was tabled in Parliament in 1995, he said citizens have a right to know about the complete report.He sought a direction to the Home Secretary to handover a true copy of the Vohra Committee Report along with annexures and notes to the NIA Director, CBI Director, ED Director, IB Director, SFIO Director, RAW Director, NCB Director, CBDT Chairman and Lokpal Chairperson.Upadhyay said the Lokpal Chairperson should be directed to monitor the probe into the alleged criminal-politician nexus.

However the RBI and the NPCI instead of fulfilling their statutory obligations and protecting and securing the sensitive data of users are compromising the interest of the Indian users by allowing the non-compliant foreign entities to operate its payment services in India, he alleged.The RBI and NPCI have permitted the three members of ‘Big Four Tech Giants’, i.e., Amazon, Google and Facebook/WhatsApp (Beta phase) to participate in the UPI ecosystem without much scrutiny and in spite of blatant violations of UPI guidelines and RBI regulations, he alleged.The conduct of RBI and NPCI put the sensitive financial data of Indian users at huge risks, especially when these entities have been continuously accused of abusing dominance and compromising data, among other things, the petitioner submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-take-up-pil-seeking-guidelines-for-uti-platforms-next-week-173250

Besides this will allow workers to earn more through overtime allowance,” a senior labour ministry official told PTI.The official further said: “We have made necessary provision in the draft rules so that all workers working beyond eight hours get overtime”.   As per draft rules on OSH Code, in calculating overtime on any day, a fraction of an hour between 15-30 minutes shall be counted as 30 minutes.At present, less than 30 minutes is not counted as overtime in the existing legal framework.The draft rules say: “No worker shall be required or allowed to work in an establishment for more than 48 hours in any week. The period of work of a worker shall be so arranged that inclusive of his intervals for rest, shall not spread over for more than twelve hours in a day”.As per the draft, no worker will work for more than five hours before he has had an interval for rest of at least half an hour.Rules also provide that the working hours in a day can be modified subject to weekly cap of 48 hours.The OSH Code as passed by Parliament says: “No worker shall be required or allowed to work, in any establishment or class of establishment for more than eight hours in a day and the period of work in each day under clause (a) (eight hours) shall be so fixed, as not to exceed such hours, with such intervals and spread overs, as may be notified by the appropriate Government”. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/labour-ministry-proposes-12-working-hours-in-new-draft-rules-173236

20-11-2020||Naveen S Garewal||KCR reignites Hindi debate, writes to PM||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, November 20Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to provide a fair and equal opportunity to students who are not well versed in English and Hindi by allowing them to write the exams in regional languages.In his letter, the Chief Minister stated that all the competitive exams for recruitment to posts in Central Government, Central public sector undertakings, Railways, Defence services, nationalised banks, etc., are held in only two languages – Hindi and English. “Students who do not study in English medium or those who are not from Hindi speaking states face serious disadvantage in these competitive examinations,” he wrote in the letter.The move is being seen as an anti-Hindi stand of some regional states who want their own languages to be promoted rather than what they call “imposing Hindi”. The letter is likely to revive the debate on the use of Hindi in non-Hindi speaking states.In his letter KCR said that the Centre should conduct all competitive exams for Central Government jobs through its departments and the Union Public Service Commission in languages best known to the candidates.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kcr-reignites-hindi-debate-writes-to-pm-173228

Lack of action in such cases will only give wings to the corrupt to continue with such anti-national activities in future and is, therefore, not acceptable,” it said.Corruption in the matter of defence purchases has a debilitating impact on India’s defence preparedness, it said, citing the Bofors scandal as a case in point.While the Swedish firm was blacklisted, India lost out on the further supply and indigenous development of an excellent artillery gun, seriously impacting the Army’s capability and modernisation effort, it added.A prime reason for corruption in defence deals has been the delay in prosecuting those responsible for it, the statement said.The BJP has cited reported statements of some key accused to allege involvement of some Congress leaders and their kin in the AgustaWestland case.The Congress had in the past rejected the allegations as baseless.

Kamra’s tweets clearly crossed the line between humour and contempt of court, he had noted.However, Kamra had refused to retract his tweets insinuating the Supreme Court or apologise for them, saying he believed they “speak for themselves” even as several persons filed criminal contempt of court petitions against him. On November 13, a defiant Kamra had released a statement addressed to Venugopal and the top court judges justifying his controversial tweets.The consent of either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General is necessary, under Section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, for initiating contempt proceedings against a person.On Friday, Venugopal granted fresh consent on a request made in this regard by Prayagraj-based advocate Anuj Singh regarding Kamra’s November18 tweet making an objectionable gesture while making a comment against the Chief Justice of India.“I have gone through your request for consent under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 against Kunal Kamra in respect of the tweet dated November 18, 2020 (at 9.46 PM), Venugopal said in his letter to Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/attorney-general-grants-consent-for-contempt-proceedings-against-kunal-kamra-over-fresh-tweet-173222
20-11-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Board exams schedule to be announced soon, says CBSE Secretary||The Central Board of Secondary Examination will likely announce its schedule for Class 10 and 12 exams soon, board secretary Anurag Tripathi’s said on Friday.Tripathi’s statement comes amid demands from various quarters for cancellation or postponement of board exams in view of rising COVID-19 cases.“The board exams will happen for sure and a schedule will be announced very soon. The CBSE is making plans and will soon reveal how it will do test assessments,” he said during a webinar on “New Education Policy (NEP): Brighter future of school education” organised by ASSOCHAM.He, however, did not comment upon whether the exams will be conducted in the same format and will be held in February-March as per schedule or will be postponed.“During March-April we were flummoxed as to how to move forward, but our schools and teachers rose to the occasion and transformed, trained themselves in using new technology for teaching purposes and within few months conducting online classes using different apps became normal,” Tripathi said.Schools across the country were closed in March in order to contain spread of novel coronavirus and opened partially in some states from October 15. However, few states decided to keep them closed or closed again in view of spike in COVID-19 cases.The board exams which had to be postponed mid-way were later cancelled and the results were announced on basis of an alternative assessment scheme.There have been demands for postponement of board exams to May in view of continued closure of schools and teaching-learning activities being completely online.Noting that a common aim of all education policies including the new National Education Policy (NEP) has been to shift students from rote learning to experiential learning, Tripathi said, “the entire NEP 2020’s thrust and main aim is to make a shift to skill and competency based education”.“We need to move students away from knowledge based education to competency and skill based learning. To implement skill-based, competency based education there is a need to transform and follow entire pedagogy based teaching-learning process be it classroom teaching, face-to-face teaching or online teaching.“The pedagogy based teaching-learning process is more about making students more curious, innovative, creative and providing them experiential learning and this can be achieved only when schools, teachers and principals change the teaching pedagogy,” he said.

The sources of acquisition of the remaining jewellery are being verified.""The source of total cash found amounting to Rs 1.30 crore is being further verified," the CBDT, the administrative authority for the tax department, said in a statement.It added that seven lockers have been found, which are yet to be operated."The main allegations against the group are that it has taken accommodation entries (hawala) of more than Rs 100 crore in the form of non-genuine unsecured loans from certain Delhi-based shell or dummy companies, unusually high sundry creditors, suppression of net profit and also that a related group chit fund company had received unsecured loans of several crore from unknown sources."   "During the searches, it has been established that the shell companies from which loans had been taken exist only on paper and have no real business and creditworthiness," it said.The CBDT said the directors of these shell companies are dummy, non-filers and individuals of no means.     "One of the directors of these companies has been found to be a taxi driver, having 11 bank accounts, showing huge routing of funds," it said."Therefore, it has been established that the accommodation entries of more than Rs 121 crore in the form of unsecured loans from these shell companies are bogus and actually represent the unaccounted income of the group," said the CBDT.It said one of these shell companies is a chit subscriber in the group's chit fund concern which is a violation of the Chit Funds Act, 1982.   "Search has revealed huge unaccounted investment in the construction of the residences of the main persons of the group. The same is under verification and will be referred for valuation," it said.

20-11-2020||New Delhi||Indo-Pacific concept a rejection of spheres of influence: Jaishankar||The concept of Indo-Pacific is a rejection of the spheres of influence and a reiteration that the world cannot be frozen for the benefit of a few even if that is the case with the United Nations, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Friday.Addressing a global town hall event via video-conferencing, Jaishankar also said that the Indo-Pacific was an indication of a future not a throwback to the past and “only those harbouring a Cold War mindset will see such intentions”.His remarks come in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle-flexing in the region which has become a major talking point among leading global powers.Jaishankar said there has been a growing recognition of the logic of the Indo-Pacific in recent times and the ASEAN’s outlook on it was a notable step.“Apart from the nations of the larger region, we’ve also seen Germany, France and the Netherlands subscribe recently to this approach. The need of the day is to give it a practical shape, this can be done by plurilateral diplomatic consultations such as the QUAD or it can be furthered in a structured fashion by the Indo-Pacific Oceans initiative that India tabled at the East Asia Summit in 2019,” Jaishankar said at the town hall session, titled ‘The Indo-Pacific and the COVID crisis’.“This is built on the seven pillars of maritime security; maritime ecology; maritime resources, capacity building and resource sharing; disaster risk reduction and management; science, technology and academic cooperation; and trade, connectivity and maritime transport,” he said.Jaishankar said that from any objective viewpoint, Indo-Pacific is a more contemporary description of the current reality.Such a landscape creates an ethos for greater cooperation—one particularly necessary at a time when global goods are in short supply, he said.Jaishankar said that when challenges multiply but capacities do not keep pace, the answer is only in more intensified cooperation.Issues like maritime security, transparent and market-based connectivity or counter-terrorism do require such solutions, he said.“Indo-Pacific is also a rejection of spheres of influence and all that this may imply. It is a reiteration that the world cannot be frozen for the benefit of a few even if that is the case with the United Nations,” Jaishankar said.“It is an indication of a future not a throwback to the past. Only those harbouring a Cold War mindset will see such intentions,” the External Affairs Minister said.Every era produces its own strategic concepts and analytical constructs and the current one is no exception, Jaishankar said, adding that after all the sharp distinction between the Pacific and the Indian Ocean theatres was only made after the World War II.On June 1, 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi outlined India’s vision for the Indo-Pacific region in his speech delivered at the Shangri La Dialogue in Singapore.India’s concept of the Indo-Pacific is inclusive in nature, and supports an approach that respects the right to freedom of navigation and overflight for all in the international seas.Jaishankar said that it was natural that different ideas and suggestions were at interplay and harmonising them was very much part of the pluralistic political culture that many support.In India’s case, the Indo-Pacific was a natural extrapolation of its Act East policy that has made China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Australia, amongst others, its major partners, he said.In his address, Jaishankar also highlighted India’s effective response to the COVID crisis and its emphasis on global cooperation to deal with global challenges.Noting that India had responded with determination and discipline to the COVID-19 challenge, he said an economy which did not make ventilators, testing kits, PPEs and N-95 masks, today not only caters to its own needs, but those beyond.“By setting up more than 15,000 dedicated COVID treatment facilities, we created an infrastructure to respond effectively. A high recovery rate and low case fatality rate speak for themselves, indeed does the social distancing culture and mass adoption of preventive measures,” Jaishankar said.But, for the world what is more important is the emphasis India has put on global cooperation to deal with global challenges, he said.COVID-19 created a spike in demand for pharmaceuticals, especially for hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol, and India ramped up production, as it responded to the requirement of others, he said.Pointing out that that now the focus has shifted to vaccine production and testing, he said both were essential to the return of travel normalcy.“India is deeply involved in many international collaborations and initiatives. Prime Minister Modi has committed to the UN that we will help make vaccines accessible and affordable to all,” Jaishankar said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indo-pacific-concept-a-rejection-of-spheres-of-influence-jaishankar-173198

20-11-2020||New Delhi||SC to hear on Nov 23 plea for regulation to ensure UPI platform data not exploited||The Supreme Court Friday said it would hear on November 23 the plea filed by Rajya Sabha MP Binoy Viswam seeking direction to the RBI for framing regulation to ensure that data collected on UPI platforms are not “exploited” or used in any manner other than for processing payments.The matter came up for hearing before a bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian which listed it for hearing next week.On October 15, the Apex Court had sought responses from the Centre, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and others including Google Inc, Facebook Inc, WhatsApp and Amazon Inc on the plea.Viswam, the Communist Party of India (CPI) leader, has sought a direction to the RBI and the NPCI to ensure that data collected on Unified Payments Interface (UPI) platforms was not shared with their parent company or any other third party under any circumstances.“In India, the UPI payments system is being regulated and supervised by Respondent no. 1 (RBI) and Respondent no. 2 (NPCI), however, the RBI and the NPCI instead of fulfilling their statutory obligations and protecting and securing the sensitive data of users are compromising the interest of the Indian users by allowing the non-compliant foreign entities to operate its payment services in India,” the plea has alleged.“The RBI and the NPCI have permitted the three members of ‘Big Four Tech Giants' i.e. Amazon, Google and Facebook/WhatsApp (Beta phase) to participate in the UPI ecosystem without much scrutiny and in spite of blatant violations of the UPI guidelines and the RBI regulations,” it claimed.The plea has alleged that this conduct of the RBI and the NPCI put the sensitive financial data of Indian users at huge risks, especially when these entities have been “continuously accused of abusing dominance and compromising data”, among other things.It said these allegations have become particularly worrisome at a time when India has banned a host of Chinese applications on the ground that those applications were or could be used for data theft and could lead to security breaches.It has further sought a direction that the RBI and the NPCI should ensure that WhatsApp was not permitted to launch full-scale operations of ‘WhatsApp Pay’ in India without fulfilling all legal compliances to the satisfaction of the court regarding requisite regulatory compliances.It said that in April 2018, the RBI, with a view to secure the data of Indian users, had issued a circular directing all system providers to ensure that entire data relating to payment systems operated by them are stored in systems only in India and they were asked to ensure compliance by October 15, 2018.The plea claimed that later, the RBI toned down the April 2018 circular by issuing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and permitted processing of all payment transaction abroad, including domestic transactions.In the said FAQ it was clarified that in cases of data processing done abroad, the data should be deleted from the systems abroad and brought back to India within 24 hours, the plea said.It has sought the apex court's direction to declare the FAQ dated June 26, 2019, issued by the RBI as ultra vires to the circular dated April 6, 2018.The plea referred to another pending petition in the apex court and said that in that matter, the counsel appearing for WhatsApp had undertaken that his client would not go ahead with payment services without complying with all the regulation in force.It alleged that Google and Facebook already have access to “immense personal data of millions of Indian users” and if they are permitted to collect “unrestricted financial data” of Indian users while operating at the UPI platform, the same would give them “draconian control” over sensitive Indian data.

20-11-2020||Bhubaneswar||Indian teen's solar iron smooths a pressing problem||On India's residential streets, amid the tea vendors and vegetable sellers, ironing "wallahs" press clothes each day for millions of Indians, smoothing out wrinkles with iron boxes packed with hot charcoal.But India's 10 million ironing carts and shops take a hefty toll on the country's forests. Each uses, on average, more than 5 kilograms of charcoal each day, the government's science and technology department estimates.Now, however, a 14-year-old girl, troubled by the heaps of used charcoal left by her local ironing vendor and by his painful wheeze from pollution, has developed an alternative: an award-winning solar-powered iron."I calculated the enormous quantity of charcoal being used, the pollution from it that worsens climate change, damages Mother Earth and human health. I wanted to create a renewable resource to replace charcoal," said Vinisha Umashankar from her hometown of Tiruvannamalai, in India's southern Tamil Nadu state.This week her innovation was recognised with the Children's Climate Prize for its contributions to cleaner air. The prize, backed by a Swedish energy company, includes 100,000 Swedish krona ($11,600) to further develop the project.It is just one of several national and international prizes Umashankar has won for her innovation: a wheeled cart equipped with solar panels and batteries sufficient to power a steam iron.'INEVITABLE'Panels on the cart's roof produce solar power that can be used immediately as the cart wends its way between customers or stored in four batteries, Umashankar said.When fully charged - which takes just under five hours in bright sunshine - each battery can power the iron for six hours, she said, providing power on cloudy days, though the cart can also run on grid electricity or a generator in a pinch.To boost earnings for ironing vendors, the carts are also equipped with a mobile phone recharging station and a coin-operated telephone for making calls.Umashankar said she hopes the cart - which she developed after school over six months - will improve incomes and health for ironing vendors and offer them "a dignified life".It could also be used in other developing countries, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a telephone interview.She said she had designed the cart so it was easy to operate - the system takes 15 minutes to learn - and she planned to produce online videos to help those who speak other languages understand how to use it."Today, solar energy is inevitable", particular in sunny nations such as India, where some parts of the country get 300 days of sun a year, she said.The country receives enough sunshine to produce solar power equivalent to 3,000 times the country's current energy consumption, she added.COSTSWhile Umashankar developed the detailed design, the first full-scale working prototype was put together and tested last December by the National Innovation Foundation, which operates under India's Department of Science and Technology.The foundation has also applied for a patent for the device, on Umashankar's behalf.The girl, who said she sees radioactivity scientist Marie Curie as a role model, said the cart could save a "countless number of trees".She said she had read that a large tree can produce enough oxygen for five people in a day - and mature trees are most likely to be logged as they produce the best charcoal."What's the point of planting trees if we can't stop cutting trees for making unsustainable charcoal?" she asked.She said she believes ironing vendors will make the switch to her device if it is cost effective.Enough charcoal for two day of ironing costs 700 to 1,000 rupees ($9 to $13), she said. The cart, as currently configured, by comparison, costs 40,000 rupees ($540).But Umashankar said she hopes to use her prize money to develop a new prototype that will reduce costs and boost efficiency."In the long run my innovation will not only work out cheaper for vendors but help the environment too," she predicted, with each cart's solar panels and batteries built to last at least eight years.Sam Barratt of the U.N. Environment Programme, one of the members of the jury for the Children's Climate Prize, said Umashankar and other young innovators were "coming at the challenge with all the smarts, passion and energy that is needed to change the future to the one we all need".Umashankar said her parents and grandparents had talked about how it was cooler and seasons were more predictable when they were younger, while she and others have noticed increasing heat and pollution."This generation... wants normal weather, which also will reduce droughts and floods. That is one reason why we take so much interest in climate change," she said. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-teens-solar-iron-smooths-a-pressing-problem-173184

These are Anand Sharma, Shashi Tharoor, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Veerappa Moily.The four leaders, after flagging their concerns in the controversial letter, refrained from making critical remarks of the leadership.Veteran Kapil Sibal, the only letter writer to again castigate the Congress for its inertia in the face of poll losses, hasn’t found a place in any panel.Anand Sharma and Tharoor have been named in the committee on foreign affairs. Sharma had recently contradicted Congress stand on India’s position vis a vis the RCEP and has argued that India should have joined the trade block. This was against the previous party line which Congress leader Rahul Gandhi articulated last year when he repeatedly made public statements against India joining the RCEP.Ghulam Nabi Azad and Moily have been made members of the committee on national security.Each of the three panels consists of five leaders including a convenor.The panel on economic affairs features Manmohan Singh, P Chidambaram, Mallikarjun Kharge, Digvijay Singh and Jairam Ramesh (convenor).The committee on foreign affairs has Manmohan Singh, Anand Sharma, Tharoor, Saptagiri Ulaka and Salman Khurshid (convenor).The third panel on national security has Singh, Azad, Moily, V Vaithilingam and Vincent Pala (convenor).Sonia Gandhi meanwhile left Delhi today with her son Rahul Gandhi amid calls for review of the party’s Bihar poll loss.Congress sources said she had been advised by doctors to stay away from Delhi to avoid pollution.Gandhi is to stay in Goa or Chennai, said sources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-gandhi-forms-congress-panels-some-letter-writers-accommodated-sibal-left-out-173183
20-11-2020||Jaipur||‘Love jihad' a term coined by BJP to disturb communal harmony: Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday said “love jihad” is a term “manufactured” by the BJP to disturb communal harmony, provoking a sharp reaction from Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat.In a tweet, Gehlot said marriage is a matter of personal liberty and bringing a law to curb it is unconstitutional. Hitting back, Shekhawat asked if marriage is a matter of personal liberty “why are the women not free to use their maiden name or religion”.BJP leaders use the term “love jihad” while alleging that Hindu women face harassment and forced conversion in the name of love and marriage.BJP governments in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh have said they are considering enactment of laws to curb such marriages.But Gehlot said such law will not stand scrutiny in any court.“Love jihad is a word manufactured by BJP to divide the nation and disturb communal harmony,” the Congress leader tweeted.“Jihad has no place in love. They are creating an environment in the nation where consenting adults would be at the mercy of state power. Marriage is a personal decision and they are putting curbs on it, which is like snatching away personal liberty,” Gehlot said.“It seems a ploy to disrupt communal harmony, fuel social conflict and disregard constitutional provisions like the state not discriminating against citizens on any ground,” he added.Union Jal Shakti Minister and prominent BJP leader from Rajasthan Gajendra Singh Shekhawat reacted strongly.“Dear Ashok ji, Love Jihad is a trap that has thousands of young women believing the marriage is a personal affair, where later it turns out it isn’t. Also, if it is a matter of personal liberty, then why are the women not free to keep their maiden name or religion?” he asked.“Why are families of girls too forced to accept the other religion? Isn’t religion a matter of personal liberty?” he tweeted. Shekhawat asked if supporting this in the guise of personal freedom was the “new communal agenda” of the Congress.He charged that “manufacturing terms, riots and hatred is a Congress prerogative”.The BJP, he said believed in “Sabka Vikas”, or universal development, and will ensure that womenfolk are “not subject to injustice of any kind”       BJP’s Rajasthan president Satish Poonia also targeted Gehlot, claiming that his statement reflected “petty vote bank politics”.“It is hard to believe that the chief minister will get so rattled by the plight of the Congress nationwide. We all know that marriage in the tradition of India is a religious and socially recognised rite, and is not limited only to freedom of the individual,” he said.“The manner in which our innocent girls face harassment under the Islamic terror agenda of love jihad is well known,” Poonia said.“In such a situation, his statement definitely reflects a petty mentality and petty vote bank politics.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/love-jihad-a-term-coined-by-bjp-to-disturb-communal-harmony-ashok-gehlot-173181

He was presented before a court and was currently in judicial custody.“It is revealed during the investigation, he, along with other PFI activists and their student wing (Campus Front of India) leaders, was going to Hathras under the garb of journalism with a very determined design to create a caste divide and disturb law and order situation, and were also found carrying incriminating material,” the affidavit stated.“When he was brought by the STF to Delhi, he misled the police by a residential address, which was later found invalid. He did not assist in the investigation and gave misleading details. His flatmate, who is also a member of the PFI and its various wings, was denied access. Finally, armed with search warrants, when the premises were searched by the police, further incriminating material was recovered, all of which is the subject matter of investigation as stated hereunder,” UP government told the top court.A Bench led by CJI SA Bobde expressed displeasure over inaccurate reporting of its previous proceedings that it had refused relief in the case.It asked senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing the KUWJ, to peruse the UP government’s affidavit and adjourned the hearing to next week.The Bench recorded the state government’s statement that there was no objection to an advocate approaching Kappan to obtain his signature for a ‘vakalatnama’ to represent him in court.“There was no objection and there is no objection,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the top court.Mehta said the accused had been in touch with lawyers.The UP government affidavit said: “That during the judicial custody of accused Sidhique Kappan, on his written requests, he has interacted with his family members on three occasions on phone on November 2, 10 and 17. It is pertinent to note that accused Sidhique Kappan has never requested to meet any relative or any lawyer nor has file any such application before the competent court or jail Authorities to date.”Questioning locus standi of the KUWJ, the UP government urged the top court to dismiss the petition.The Supreme Court had on November 16 issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government to respond to the KUWJ petition challenging Kappan’s arrest.The rape-cum-murder case is being probed by the CBI. After the September 14 incident, the 19-year-old woman had died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital during treatment and her body was cremated at night near her home on September 30.The Bench had posted the matter for hearing on Friday even as it wondered why the KUWJ did not approach the Allahabad High Court and directly came to it.Sibal had sought bail for the Kappan, saying: “The FIR does not name him. No offences alleged. He has been in jail since October 5.”Earlier, the top court had said it would hear the plea after four weeks and in the meantime, the petitioner could approach the Allahabad high court for the relief.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pfi-activist-siddique-kappan-tried-to-create-communal-tension-in-hathras-up-tells-sc-173168
20-11-2020||New Delhi||India-US ties to get stronger: Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla||Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said it was his "firm conviction’’ that India-US ties are only going to get stronger.Shringla said a remarkable feature of the bilateral ties was the strong bi-partisan support in the US to strengthen its strategic partnership with India and work together on addressing global challenges."We believe that the US is a natural partner for India in our quest for building a resilient economy. We look forward to working with the new US Administration for further strengthening and consolidating this multifaceted relationship for our mutual benefit and economic prosperity,’’ Speaking at a virtual interaction with the US India Strategic Partnership Forum late on Thursday.Shringla, as India’s former ambassador to the US, has personally witnessed the growing convergence between India and the US over recent years, especially in strategic and defence cooperation, energy, economic and people-to-people ties."The elevation of our bilateral relationship to a Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership in February, during US President Donald Trump’s India visit this year illustrates this effectively,’’ he said.Shringla pointed out that India and the US have collectively affirmed the importance of maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, with firm support for ASEAN centrality.Shringla also provided insight into two recent and significant high-level interactions involving the US.With Quad, the Indian objective is to advance the security and economic interests of all countries having a legitimate stake in the Indo-Pacific region. The Quad Ministerial in Tokyo last month emphasised the need to share best practices to combat Covid and enhance the resilience of global supply chains.The third India-US 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue took place last month against the backdrop of the ongoing pandemic, efforts to revitalise economies and regional and global developments of interest to both countries.There was a substantive discussion on a coordinated Covid response and efforts towards economic recovery. Both sides strengthened their resolve in developing vaccines, therapeutics, ventilators and other essential medical equipment and to jointly promote access to a high quality, safe, effective and affordable vaccine.India and the US also resolved to enhance supply chain resilience and seek alternatives to the current paradigm, which has come under severe strain during the pandemic and exposed critical vulnerabilities. Our two countries sought to support the global economic recovery and to emerge from the pandemic more resilient than ever. In this regard, they welcomed efforts to rejuvenate and expand bilateral India-US trade in the wake of the pandemic.As India assumes membership of the UN Security Council in January next year, Shringla said reformed multilateralism shall be critical in addressing unprecedented challenges and delivering effective results.Another global challenge is tackling climate change. India will go beyond its commitments in the fight against climate change despite huge developmental challenges and limited availability of energy.India is aiming to achieve 175 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 and further increase this to 450 GW by 2030. It is also committed to achieving 40 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel sources and restoring 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030.In this respect, he referred to the PM’s initiative to launch multilateral partnerships such as the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI).India, he said, is on track on the development and trial of COVID vaccines, and exploring the possibility of conducting phase III trials in a few countries.Based on willingness, India could go for joint production of vaccines in some countries. It has already conducted online training sessions for nearly 90 participants from eight neighbouring countries to develop capacity in clinical trials and clinical practices. India will also help interested countries in enhancing their cold chain and storage capacities for the delivery of vaccines, he offered.Shringla also mentioned the series of reforms to boost the investment climate in India and position the country as a low-cost manufacturing destination in the region.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-ties-to-get-stronger-foreign-secretary-harsh-vardhan-shringla-173167

(SIRECL) and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation Ltd.

In protest, the BJP had called for a “bandh” in the area yesterday, which led to more violence.A few days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had obliquely cautioned the TMC leadership regarding killings of workers of rival parties while addressing workers at BJP headquarters following victory of the NDA in Bihar Assembly election.“By the killings, they cannot win election. They should read the writing on the wall,” Modi said with regard coming Assembly election in Bengal.Subsequently, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, during his political visit to the state, had decried killings of more than 100 BJP workers over a period of time.The BJP had sprung a surprise by winning 18 of the total of 42 parliamentary seats in Bengal in the 2019 General Election, besides running the dominant TMC close at another two seats.To boot, it decimated and relegated the Left parties and the Congress, thereby, heralding itself as the principal Opposition to the TMC in the state’s political landscape.Also, Shah has created a flutter by his announcement that the BJP would win the Assembly election in the state by securing two-thirds majority of seats on its own.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengal-govt-boycotts-centres-world-toilet-day-virtual-function-173153

There is no need to panic. Do not back down from this," he told the state's police personnel."If someone is walking around with an illegal weapon, he is not roaming around to play or worship it, but to take someone's life. In such a situation, if he is seen shooting, we have given clear instructions that the police should not hesitate in killing him. The law also allows this," Rao, the director-general of police, said.All criminals, who have been to jail for crimes involving illegal firearms, will be investigated, the officer said."If he is in jail then it's fine.

Information will be collected from their parents, siblings, family, in-laws and friends," he said."If such a criminal tries to endanger the life and property of others, then the police will act harshly," Rao warned.

20-11-2020||Kollam (Kerala)||This 'Corona' is busy seeking votes as the world fights coronavirus||Everywhere else in this world, the word 'corona' triggers a sense of alarm and concern except in a locality in this south Kerala town, where it is uttered with love and amusement now.A young woman may come to you any time with a smile and folded hands, introducing herself as "Corona" if you travel through Mathilil ward which is in Kollam Corporation, these days.She is Corona Thomas, the Bharatiya Janata Party candidate from Mathilil ward in the local body elections due next month.In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, Corona goes for campaigning and house visits wearing a mask and gloves and offering sanitizers to the public while meeting and greeting them seeking votes.She is also very particular in ensuring social distancing as part of the fight against the virus.The 24-year old woman said though the name had caused her embarrassment and pain during the initial days of the COVID-19 outbreak, it has now turned out to be a blessing in disguise during the election campaign."Because of my name, everyone recognises and remembers me during the campaign. Wherever I go, people call my name with amusement. I hope this name will help voters to remember me on election day and make them cast votes in my favour," Corona told P T I.She said her artist father, Thomas Francis, who had picked rare names for her and her twin brother, might never have thought that one day it would be the same as a contagious viral infection which brought the world to a standstill and turned everyone's life topsy-turvy.Francis had picked the name 'Corona', which means 'halo' for daughter while choosing Coral for his son.Corona said even during school days, the name used to cause her embarrassment as friends and classmates used to mock her asking why she had such a name which was totally unheard of."It also earned me many nicknames during school time. But things got serious when the virus spread worldwide. Slogans like 'Go Corona' and 'Kill Corona' really irritated me in the beginning," she said.Ironically, a pregnant Corona had tested positive for the virus when her due date was just days away recently.But, successfully battling the virus, she and her baby survived the infection.Though she had recovered from the infection, post- disease effects like heaviness in the chest and breathing issues were still causing her some difficulty.Her husband Jinu is an active member of BJP which helped Corona take the electoral plunge.Stating that she had positive hopes about a victory, Corona believed her name would finally bring in some luck when the ballot boxes are opened.Despite all the publicity and media attention garnered by his wife because of the name, Jinu has a complaint."Non-stop talk with journalists takes the lion's share of her time and we are finding it hard to get time for campaigning," he said with a smile.Not just the woman but two shops also grab eyeballs for the name"Corona" in Kerala.George, who runs an interior design shop in Kottayam district, would never have thought that the name of his shop would make news one day while choosing it seven years ago.He said more out of amusement and curiosity, people were coming to the shop nowadays after the COVID-19 outbreak and business was flourishing.A garment shop in Muvattupuzha in Ernakulam district also has the name Corona and interestingly its owner, Pareed is popularly known as "Corona Pareed" for several years.

20-11-2020||Panaji/New Delhi||Sonia Gandhi reaches coastal Goa from Delhi on medical advice||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday reached Goa from Delhi for a few days after doctors advised her to get away from the heavy pollution in the national capital in view of her chronic chest infection, party insiders said.The private flight carrying Sonia Gandhi (73) and her son Rahul Gandhi landed at Dabolim airport in South Goa at 2.50 pm, a police official said. From the airport, they left for a luxury hotel in South Goa, he added.A Goa Congress leader said the Gandhi family is on a private visit to the coastal state and there are no party engagements lined up during their stay. It is not clear for how long they will be staying in the coastal state, he said.Congress sources in Delhi said Sonia Gandhi will be in Goa till the air quality improves.She has been under heavy medication after her discharge from hospital in August and doctors were concerned about her persistent chest infection, they said."The Congress president was advised by doctors to shift out of Delhi to a place with cleaner air. The polluted air in Delhi has taken a toll on her health and has aggravated her asthma and chest condition, despite medication."On the advice of doctors, she has moved out of Delhi for a few days till the air quality in the national capital improves," a senior Congress leader told PTI.Sonia Gandhi's temporary move to Goa comes at a time a section of leaders is seeking introspection over the party's loss in the recent Bihar elections. Some have written to her seeking an organisational overhaul.The Congress president was admitted to the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi on July 30 evening. Later, on September 12, she went abroad for a few days for a routine medical check-up and was accompanied by her son.This meant the two leaders missed the monsoon session of Parliament from September 14 to 23, held under special conditions due to coronavirus pandemic.This is not the first Goa sojourn for the Congress president. She has visited the coastal state many times during the last three years.In December 2017, a photo of Sonia Gandhi riding a bicycle in Goa was widely shared on social media. In January 2019, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were in Goa on a three-day private visit. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-gandhi-reaches-coastal-goa-from-delhi-on-medical-advice-173127
20-11-2020||New Delhi||India asks for record access to Facebook users’ data in 2020 1st half||The requests by the Indian government to seek access to Facebook users’ data further increased in the first six months of this year, second only to the US government, the social networking giant has revealed.In total, India requested Facebook to provide data in 35,560 cases in the January-June 2020 period — significantly up from 26,698 queries about users’ data in the second half of 2019.Facebook provided data in 50 per cent of the requests, according to its latest biannual Transparency Report.“We have strict guidelines in place to deal with all government data requests,” Facebook said in a statement late on Thursday.There were a total of 33,374 legal requests and 2,186 emergency requests from India. There was also an increase in the Indian government’s request to preserve account information too, pending the receipt of formal legal process.In the January-June 2020 period, India asked for 4,100 accounts to be preserved, from 2,500 account requests in earlier reported periods.Globally, during the first six months of 2020, the government requests for user data increased by 23 per cent from 1,40,875 to 1,73,592.“Of the total volume, the US continues to submit the largest number of requests, followed by India, Germany, France, and the UK,” Facebook said.In the US, Facebook received 61,528 requests, an increase of 20 per cent compared to the second half of 2019.During this reporting period, the volume of content restrictions based on local law increased globally 40 per cent from 15,826 to 22,120.The increase was in part related to COVID-related restrictions.“In the first half of 2020, we identified 52 disruptions of Facebook services in nine countries, compared to 45 disruptions in six countries in the second half of 2019,” the company said.During this reporting period, Facebook took down 37,16,817 pieces of content based on 6,59,444 copyright reports; 4,04,078 pieces of content based on 1,66,310 trademark reports; and 13,08,834 pieces of content based on 97,186 counterfeit reports.

20-11-2020||New Delhi||At Rs 1,000, India could get Covid vaccine by April next year, says Serum Institute CEO||Vaccine maker Serum Institute of India's CEO Adar Poonawalla on Thursday said the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine should be available for healthcare workers and elderly people by around February 2021 and by April for the general public, and will be priced at a maximum of Rs 1,000 for two necessary doses for the public, depending on the final trial results and regulatory approvals.Probably by 2024, every Indian will get vaccinated, he said at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit (HTLS), 2020."It will probably take two or three years for every Indian to get inoculated, not just because of the supply constraints but because you need the budget, the vaccine, logistics, infrastructure and then, people should be willing to take the vaccine. So these are the factors that lead up to being able to vaccinate 80-90 per cent of the population."It will be 2024 for everybody, if willing to take a two-dose vaccine, to be vaccinated," Poonawalla said.    Asked at what price the public will get it, he said it will be around USD 5-6 per dose with an MRP of around Rs 1,000 for the two necessary doses."The government of India will be getting it at a far cheaper price at around USD 3-4, because it will be buying in a large volume and get access to the price that is similar to what COVAX has got. We are still pricing it far cheaper and more affordable than other vaccines we have in the market today," Poonawalla said.Asked about the efficacy of the vaccine, he said the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine is so far proving to work very well even in elderly people, which was a concern earlier."It has induced a good T-cell response, which is an indicator for your long-term immunity and antibody response but then again, time will only tell if these vaccines are going to protect you in the long term. Nobody can answer that for any of the vaccines today," Poonawalla said.Responding to a question on the safety aspect, he said there has been no major complaints, reactions or adverse events, adding, "We would need to wait and see. The efficacy and immunogenicity results from the Indian trials will come out in about a month-and-a half." Asked when the SII will apply for an emergency authorisation, Poonawalla said as soon as the UK authorities and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) approve it for emergency use, it will apply to the drug controller for emergency use authorisation in India."But that will be for a limited use for frontline workers, healthcare workers and elderly people," he added.Children would have to wait a little longer till the safety data is out, but the good news is that COVID-19 is not so bad and serious for them, Poonawalla said."Unlike measles pneumonia, which is deadly, this disease is seeming to be less of a nuisance for children but then, they can be carriers and can give the infection to others."We want to vaccinate the elderly people and others who are the most vulnerable first. Once we have enough safety data to go in on children, we can recommend it for children too," he said.Poonawalla said the Oxford vaccine is affordable, safe and stored at a temperature of two to eight degrees Celsius, which is an ideal temperature for it to be stored in the cold storages of India.He said the SII plans to make about 10 crore doses per month from February.As regards how many doses would be provided to India, Poonawalla said talks are still going on and no agreement has been arrived at in this regard."India wants around 400 million doses by July. I do not know if it will take all from the Serum Institute. We are gearing up to offer that kind of volume to India and still have a few 100 million to offer to COVAX by July and August. No agreement so far," he said.Poonawala said the SII is not entering into any agreement with other countries at this moment as India is its priority."We have not signed and committed anything else beyond Bangladesh at the moment. We really do not want to partner right now with many countries because we will not have enough stocks to deliver."We want to handle India as a priority first and manage Africa at the same time and then help out other countries," he said.Poonawalla said 30-40 crore doses of the Oxford vaccine will be available by the first quarter of 2021.In another session of the summit, AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria said there is some talk going on between Pfizer and the Indian government but not much with Moderna."It is going to be a huge challenge as far as the Pfizer vaccine is concerned, considering that it needs a cold chain of minus 70 degrees Celsius," he said and pinned hoped on the vaccines that are at various stages of trial in India.On the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine, Guleria said the percentage of population to be inoculated will depend on the number of vaccines getting the regulatory approvals and the number of shots they are producing.He further said the coronavirus goes into the lungs without making a person symptomatic."We have individuals who are asymptomatic and you can see patches in their lungs at CT scans directly. It really bypasses a person's defence mechanism, which means that you not only have the virus in your nose or throat, but it has gone right into your lungs.

The older adults are known to be at higher risk from Covid-19 and should be considered to be a priority population for immunisation should any effective vaccine be developed for the disease.Reporting on data from a phase 2 trial, study authors said volunteers in the trial demonstrated similar neutralising antibodies and immune cell response across all three age groups (18-55, 56-79 and 70+).The results hold out hopes for India considering Pune-based Serum Institute of India is collaborating on the Oxford vaccine whose ongoing phase 3 trials are nearly over in India.During the phase 2 trial, the vaccine was evaluated in 560 healthy adult volunteers aged between 18-55 years, 56-69 years and aged 70 or over.This data is consistent with the phase 1 data reported for healthy adults aged 18-55 early this year.Dr Maheshi Ramasamy, investigator at the Oxford Vaccine Group and Consultant Physician said, “Older adults are a priority group for Covid-19 vaccination, because they are at increased risk of severe disease, but we know that they tend to have poorer vaccine responses. We were pleased to see that our vaccine was not only well tolerated in older adults; it also stimulated similar immune responses to those seen in younger volunteers.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oxford-vaccine-produces-strong-immunity-even-in-older-adults-172993
