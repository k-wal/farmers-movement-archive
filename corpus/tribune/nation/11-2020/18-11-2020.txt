Many other leaders, including party general secretary Tariq Anwar, have also made similar demands.“There should be a comprehensive review of the party’s performance in Bihar,” a senior leader said.Jha refused to dwell on the issue of resignations, saying he would talk about it in a party forum.“We would sit together and carry out a review of the party’s performance soon and abide by the directions of the high-command,” he said when asked about the demands for a review of the Congress’s poll show.There are also demands for a review of the ticket distribution by the party in Bihar.The Congress fared poorly in the Bihar polls, winning only 19 of the 70 seats it contested.Some of its allies such as the Shiv Sena have openly said the grand old party has proved itself to be a laggard and the “Mahagathbandhan”, led by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), could have been in power in Bihar, but for the bad performance of the Congress. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-cong-leaders-demand-comprehensive-review-of-partys-poor-poll-show-172231

We all know that the last 10 months have seen treatment interruptions, hindered availability of drugs, shrinking supply of diagnostic tests, delays in diagnosis, interrupted supply chains, diversion of manufacturing capacity and imposition of physical barriers for patients who must travel to distant clinics to pick up the medications,” he said.The minister said systems created for Covid-19 would be repurposed in the future to fight TB.India has committed to eradicating TB by 2025, ahead of the WHO’s 2030 target. The country houses one in four TB cases globally.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-impact-tb-notifications-down-29-over-last-year-172224
18-11-2020||New Delhi||DGCA will take ‘some time’ before deciding on Boeing 737 MAX planes||Aviation watchdog DGCA will study FAA’s decision and take “some time” before taking a final call on allowing Boeing 737 MAX planes to fly again in the Indian skies.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the US on Wednesday paved the way for the MAX aircraft to return to commercial service after a comprehensive and methodical safety review process that stretched for 20 months.In the wake of two fatal crashes involving MAX planes, these aircraft were grounded worldwide in 2019. Joining many other regulators worldwide, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) grounded MAX aircraft in March last year.When asked about the next step after FAA cleared the path for resumption of Boeing 737 MAX flights, a senior DGCA official told PTI that the regulator would “study and react. It will take some time.” Only two Indian carriers—SpiceJet and now-shuttered Jet Airways—were operating MAX aircraft before they were grounded on safety concerns. SpiceJet has a fleet of 13 such planes that were grounded in March 2019.In 2016-17, SpiceJet had placed an order for up to 205 MAX aircraft.A SpiceJet spokesperson did not offer any immediate comment on FAA’s approval for the MAX planes.While announcing the latest September quarter results on November 11, SpiceJet said it was continuing to incur various costs related to 13 grounded MAX planes.“Despite its inability to undertake revenue operations, the company continues to incur various costs with respect to these aircraft,” the airline said in a regulatory filing on November 11.Citing the costs and the uncertainty in timing of these planes returning to operations, SpiceJet had also said that it has “initiated the process of claims on the aircraft manufacturer towards cost and losses, which are currently under discussion”.MAX planes are fuel-efficient and would help in reducing operational costs.In addition to rescinding the order that grounded the MAX planes, FAA on Wednesday published an Airworthiness Directive specifying design changes that must be made before the aircraft returns to service, issued a Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC), and published the MAX training requirements.“These actions do not allow the MAX to return immediately to the skies. The FAA must approve 737 MAX pilot training program revisions for each US airline operating the MAX and will retain its authority to issue airworthiness certificates and export certificates of airworthiness for all new 737 MAX aircraft manufactured since the FAA issued the grounding order,” the US watchdog said in a statement.According to FAA, the design and certification of this aircraft included an unprecedented level of collaborative and independent reviews by aviation authorities around the world.“Those regulators have indicated that Boeing’s design changes, together with the changes to crew procedures and training enhancements, will give them the confidence to validate the aircraft as safe to fly in their respective countries and regions.“Following the return to service, the FAA will continue to work closely with our foreign civil aviation partners to evaluate any potential additional enhancements for the aircraft,” it noted.In a statement, Boeing said FAA has rescinded the order that halted commercial operations of Boeing 737-8s and 737-9s.The move will allow airlines that are under the FAA’s jurisdiction, including those in the US, to take the steps necessary to resume service and Boeing to begin making deliveries, it added.In March 2019, a MAX plane operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed near Addis Ababa, killing 157 people, including four Indians. In October 2018, a Lion Air-operated 737 Max crashed, leaving 180 people dead in Indonesia. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dgca-will-take-some-time-before-deciding-on-boeing-737-max-planes-172221
18-11-2020||New Delhi||SC refuses to lift stay on release of Amitabh Bachchan starrer ‘Jhund’||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to lift the stay on release of Amitabh Bachchan starrer ‘Jhund’ and dismissed an appeal against the Telangana High Court order which had stalled the movie’s screening over copyright row. A Bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian dismissed the appeal filed by petitioner Super Cassettes Industries (T Series) against the October 19 order of the high court which had refused to interfere with the trial court order restraining the release of the movie.“The special leave petitions are dismissed. As a sequel to the above, pending interlocutory applications, if any, stand disposed of,” the Bench said in its order.The film, based on the life of Vijay Barse, the founder of NGO Slum Soccer, was scheduled to be released this month on OTT platform Amazon Prime. The film was earlier scheduled to be released in May but due to COVID-19 pandemic it did not hit the screens. Hyderabad-based short-film maker Nandi Chinni Kumar has alleged copyright infringement against the film makers, who have refuted the allegation.During the hearing, the apex court observed that it is an interesting case and it would direct that the trial will be completed within six months.Counsel appearing for the filmmaker said that the movie would be useless in six months and they were willing to pay the person in question.He said that amount of Rs 1.3 crore was agreed between the parties but now they are not adhering to the agreement. Senior advocate PS Narasimha, appearing for Kumar, and others said that court may direct for disposal of the case which is pending in the trial court within six months. A trial court in Telangana had on September 17 stayed the release of the movie till the conclusion of the case. The decision of the trial court was upheld by the High Court on October 19.Super Cassettes has said in their petition filed in the top court that they have invested significant amount in production, distribution, marketing and promotion and have also created third party rights on the film which is to be broadcast on a wide scale both nationally and internationally.“A cinematograph film is a perishable commodity and halting of the complex process that leads up to the release of the film at such a belated stage could prove to be fiscally ruinous for the petitioner and make the entire project financially unviable,” the plea said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-lift-stay-on-release-of-amitabh-bachchan-starrer-jhund-172219

On January 17, 2018, the state government issued orders for written examination for the assistant teachers’ posts to select 69,000 assistant teachers.During the hearing, the top court had asked the UP government to explain as to why it changed the earlier criteria of 45% cut-off marks for general category and 40% cut-off marks for reserved category.The state government had justified the increase in cut-off marks, saying it was aimed at attracting the best talent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-paves-way-for-appointment-of-69-000-assistant-teachers-in-up-172215

In the latest incident, a grandson of the seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan Bahadur has filed a complaint with Hyderabad Police against relatives alleging that they submitted false and fabricated documents before a British Court to claim huge sums of money. Nawab Najaf Ali Khan, a grandson of the seventh Nizam complained to the Hyderabad Commissioner of Police saying false documents, including affidavits, were filed by his relatives to claim British Pounds 35 million belonging to the former ruler and currently lying in a bank in Britain.  It may be recalled that in October 2019, a UK court had ruled in favour of Nizam’s legal heirs and India in a 70-year-old legal dispute, dismissing Pakistan’s claim over the funds. The funds are lying in a London bank. In a press statement issued by Najaf Ali Khan, he said an invalid Certificate of Succession was submitted in the UK court in the Nizam’s fund case. Mukarram Jah and three other family members had “fraudulently” used the certificate in order to cause wrongful gain to themselves and resulting in loss to rest of the legal heirs of the late Nizam of Hyderabad, Najaf Ali Khan alleged. “This certificate dated February 27, 1967, was issued to Mukarram Jah by the Union Government as sole successor to the Nizam VII. We informed the Commissioner that after the 26th amendment to the Constitution in 1971 by the insertion of Article 363A, this certificate had become null and void and hence ultra-vires to the Constitution,” Najaf Ali Khan said. It may be recalled that the Nizam’s descendants, Prince Mukarram Jah, the titular eighth Nizam of Hyderabad and his younger brother Prince Muffakham Jah had joined hands with the Indian government in the legal battle against Pakistan government over around 35 million British Pound sterling lying with National Westminster Bank in London.  In his complaint, Nawab Najaf Ali Khan sought registration of a case against Mukarram Jah, his ex-wife Esra Birgen Jah, also the holder of his General Power of Attorney (GPA), his son Azmath Jah and his brother Prince Muffakham Jah.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/family-feud-over-nizams-money-resurfaces-police-complaint-filed-172209

18-11-2020|| Hyderabad||Telangana Election Commission puts flood relief grant on hold in poll-bound GHMC||Less than twenty-four hours after the Telangana State Election Commission (TSEC) allowed the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) Government continue with the distribution of grant towards flood relief, the TSEC has asked the government to put on hold distribution of flood relief funds as it affects the model code of conduct.  The TSEC had announced the elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) on Tuesday. At that point, it said that the government could continue distribution of Rs 10,000 as relief among people affected by last month’s heavy rains. But following objection by opposition parties, mainly the BJP and Congress and also upon seeing thousands of people queue up for grant, the TSEC has asked the government to stop the distribution of grant. Secretary Ashok Kumar today said that the government could start the distribution of grant money after the declaration of results on December 4. Elections to 150-member GHMC will be held on December 1.  “I request you to put on hold the registration and distribution of relief to the flood-affected families in the GHMC limits till the declaration of results as it is attracting model code of conduct and likely to influence the electors” reads the letter sent to Arvind Kumar, Principal Secretary, Municipal Administration and Urban Development.  The GHMC polls in 150 divisions covers around 20 assembly constituencies fall under the GHMC limits spread across four districts—Hyderabad, Ranga Reddy, Medchal–Malkajgiri and Sangareddy. These polls are considered to be mini elections in the state that gauge the mood of the people and their happiness index with the present government.   It is pertinent to mention that while announcing the poll schedule yesterday, State Election Commissioner C. Parthasarathi specifically mentioned that the government could continue distribution of flood relief funds as it was an on-going programme.  But after the opposition parties lodged strict complaints and accused the TRS of influencing the voters, the TSEC came up with the direction to stop distribution of grant money. Hyderabad was the worst hit by rains and floods in October that are said to be the worst in the last 100 years. The entire grant was to be distributed among the people who will be voting in the December 1 polls. It may be mentioned that the TSEC direction would help the ruling TRS as people feel that the opposition parties have created an issue to have the genuinely required grant stopped. For the past few days, a stampede-like situation has been seen across the city to apply for Rs 10,000 grant, notwithstanding the fresh wave of COVID-19 cases. The government had already released Rs 550 crore to be distributed out of which the authorities claim that they have already disbursed over Rs 470 crore in cash to 4,75,871 in the GHMC area. This is likely to become a major issue in these elections. TRS hold 99 and its friendly party All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) 44 out of the 150 divisions in the outgoing House of GHMC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-election-commission-puts-flood-relief-grant-on-hold-in-poll-bound-ghmc-172199

China is willing to promoting sustained cooperation with other countries on vaccine development and international fight against COVID-19 to defeat the virus at an early date,” he added.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said nine candidate vaccines, including two from China, are currently being evaluated for inclusion in the COVAX Facility. The COVAX is co-led by Gavi, an international vaccine alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the WHO. Its aim is to accelerate the development and manufacture of vaccines.China has roped in more than a dozen countries, including Brazil, to conduct the final phase trials of Chinese-made experimental COVID-19 vaccines and even started vaccinating thousands of its emergency workers, according to official media reports here.Yang Sheng, Deputy Director of the National Medical Products Administration’s drug registration bureau, said recently that four China-developed COVID-19 vaccines have begun the final stage of human trials overseas after obtaining approval from foreign authorities.China has been focusing on developing five types of vaccines, and each method has at least one entering clinical trials. In total, 11 vaccine candidates are in different stages of testing, Yang said.So far the coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has infected more than 54 million people around the world and killed over 1.3 million others. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/officials-will-discuss-xis-offer-of-cooperation-with-india-to-develop-covid-19-vaccine-china-172198

It could be tackled through proper medical arrangements which the government was doing effectively, he said while interacting with reporters at the Delhi Secretariat.The national capital has been witnessing a spurt in coronavirus cases since October 28 when daily cases breached the 5,000 mark for the first time. Single-day rise in cases crossed the 8,000 mark on November 11.“We have no intention of a lockdown. Let me clarify, we have made a general proposal to the Centre with regard to certain regulations like shutdown for some days in the markets where COVID-19-appropriate behaviour and social distancing violations pose threat of rapid infection,” Sisodia said.He asserted what the Delhi government has proposed are measures to prevent violations like not wearing face masks and crowding in the markets and it will not be a lockdown.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said the Centre and all agencies were making “double efforts” to control the COVID-19 situation in the national capital.He had said that massive crowds were witnessed in some of the popular markets of Delhi before Diwali and no social distancing was followed leading to a surge in COVID-19 cases. “In view of the recent situation and considering the last order of the Central government, we have requested the Centre to permit shutting down market places if necessary,” Kejriwal had said.On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 6,396 fresh COVID-19 cases, taking the infection tally to over 4.95 lakh, while 99 more fatalities pushed the death toll to 7,812.

18-11-2020||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh to have ‘cow cabinet’||The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh has decided to set up a “gau cabinet” for the protection and promotion of the cow, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced on Wednesday.“It has been decided to constitute a ‘gau cabinet’ for the protection and fostering of godhan (cow and its progeny) in the state,” Chouhan tweeted in Hindi.Ministers of Animal Husbandry, Forest, Panchayat and Rural Development, Revenue, Home and Farmers’ Welfare departments will be part of this cabinet, he said.“The first meeting will be held at 12 noon on November 22 to mark Gopashtami at Gau Sanctuary in Agar Malwa,” he added.Necessary orders for the constitution of the cow cabinet have been issued, officials said.Besides Chouhan, the cabinet will include Home Minister Narottam Mishra, Forest Minister Vijay Shah, Agriculture Minister Kamal Patel, Panchayat and Rural Development Minister Mahendra Singh Sisodia and Minister for Animal Husbandry Prem Singh Patel.Six departments will execute the decisions of the gau-cabinet in a coordinated manner, Chouhan said in a statement later.An action plan will be implemented for increasing the use of cow dung cakes (‘kanda’). The making and marketing of Gau-Kasht (cow-wood) is being encouraged at present, similarly efforts will be made to market other products made from cow milk, he said.Opposition Congress had criticised the BJP for having forgotten its election promise of creating a separate cow ministry. “Shivraj Singh, who announced the formation of a separate cow ministry (department) in the state before the 2018 assembly elections, is now talking about setting up a cabinet for cow protection and fostering,” State Congress chief Kamal Nath.He has forgotten his old announcement, Nath said.“There has been no work for cow protection and promotion during the 15 years’ BJP rule in the state. On the contrary, they reduced the money given for cow shelters,” Nath said, adding that the Congress government had started the work on construction of 1,000 cow shelters.Home Minister Mishra countered that the Congress government under Nath only talked about building cow shelters during its 15-month rule but was not able to set up even 15 shelters.“The BJP is nurturing Indian culture. The MP government has set a new example by constituting a gau cabinet,” Mishra added.Senior BJP leader Uma Bharti praised Chouhan for the decision. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/madhya-pradesh-to-have-cow-cabinet-172186
18-11-2020||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Inter-state GST invoice racket busted||An inter-state tax invoice racket with fake transactions of over Rs 131 crore and fraudulent input tax credit of over Rs 26 crore was busted by the Nagpur unit of the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI), an official said on Wednesday.The racket involves three tax payers, one from Maharashtra and two others from Karnataka, who are involved in supplying labour and providing contract services, a release by DGGI stated.The racket came to light when searches were conducted in remote areas of Chandrapur district against a taxpayer allegedly involved in issuing fake invoices and availing fraudulent input tax credit (ITC), it was stated.Further probe revealed that the taxpayer was fake and documents uploaded on the GST portal as proof of address like electricity bills etc, were all forged and fabricated, it was stated.According to the DGGI, details of two more taxpayers based in Karnataka were unearthed during the probe and it was revealed that the accused had taken GST registration on the same date, had declared same email addresses and were sole suppliers/buyers of each other.Fraudulent ITC to the tune of Rs 26.09 crore has been detected, the DGGI said, adding that the process has been initiated to apprehend the kingpin of the racket who is based in Karnataka. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-inter-state-gst-invoice-racket-busted-172184
18-11-2020||November 18||Pfizer completes COVID-19 trial with 95% efficacy, to seek emergency-use authorisation||Final results from Pfizer Inc's COVID-19 vaccine trial showed its shot had a 95 per cent success rate and two months of safety data, paving the way for the drugmaker to apply for an emergency US authorisation within days, it said on Wednesday.The vaccine's efficacy rate, the highest of any candidate in late-stage clinical trials so far, was welcomed by experts who had already said that interim results showing Pfizer's shot was over 90 per cent effective were very encouraging.Pfizer said there were 170 cases of COVID-19 in its trial of more than 43,000 volunteers and only eight people with the disease had been given the shot rather than a placebo, meaning the vaccine had a 95 per cent efficacy rate. Of the 10 people who developed severe COVID-19, one had received the vaccine."The data is very strong," said Ian Jones, a professor of virology at Britain's University of Reading. "It's looking like a real contender."Pfizer said it expected the US Food and Drug Administration's vaccine advisory committee to review and discuss the data in a public meeting that will likely be held in December."We continue to move at the speed of science, and we know that every day matters in our path to authorisation," Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said.The final analysis comes just a week after initial results from the trial showed the vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech SE, was more than 90 per cent effective. Moderna Inc on Monday released preliminary data for its vaccine, showing 94.5 per cent effectiveness.The better-than-expected results from the two vaccines, both developed with new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, have raised hopes for an end to a pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people and wreaked havoc upon economies and daily life.However, while some groups such as healthcare workers will be prioritised in the United States for vaccinations this year, it will be months before large-scale rollouts begin.The most vulnerableDistribution of a Pfizer shot is complicated by the need to store it at ultra-cold temperatures of -70 degrees Celsius. It can, however, be kept in a normal fridge for up to five days, or up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box.Pfizer said the efficacy of the vaccine was consistent across different age and ethnic groups, a sign that the immunisation could be employed broadly around the world.Efficacy in adults over 65 years, who are at particular risk from the virus, was over 94 per cent."The 94 per cent protection for older people is key. This is the evidence we needed to ensure that the most vulnerable people are protected," said Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow at the University of Liverpool's department of pharmacology.Equity markets strengthened slightly on the Pfizer news.Europe's STOXX 600 and the U.S S&P 500 futures both rose about 0.3 per cent to hit highs for the day. The moves were small, however, compared with the jump when Pfizer first announced the vaccine was more than 90 per cent effective on November 9.Pfizer shares rose 3 per cent in premarket trade while BioNTech's US-listed shares jumped 8 per cent.Mild side effectsPfizer said its two-dose vaccine, BNT162b2, was well-tolerated and that side effects were mostly mild to moderate, and cleared up quickly.The only severe adverse event that affected more than 2 per cent of those vaccinated was fatigue, which affected 3.7 per cent of recipients after the second dose. Older adults tended to report fewer and milder adverse events.Moderna named five categories of severe side effects experienced by at least 2 per cent of those who received its vaccine. It listed fatigue at a frequency of 9.7 per cent, muscle pain at 8.9 per cent, joint pain at 5.2 per cent, headache at 4.5 per cent, pain at 4.1% and redness around the injection site at 2 per cent.Pfizer's final results come as the virus is running rampant around the world, placing an enormous strain on healthcare systems with record numbers of new cases and hospitalisations.The approach of winter in the northern hemisphere in tandem with the holiday season is expected to worsen case numbers as people spend more time indoors and have family gatherings."With hundreds of thousands of people around the globe infected every day, we urgently need to get a safe and effective vaccine to the world," Pfizer's Bourla said.Pfizer and BioNTech also said they plan to submit the data to other regulatory agencies around the world and submit data from the study to a peer-reviewed scientific journal.Pfizer reiterated that it expects to make as many as 50 million vaccine doses this year, enough to protect 25 million people, and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.Of the dozens of drugmakers and research groups racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19, the next data release will likely be from AstraZeneca Plc with the University of Oxford in November or December. Johnson & Johnson says it is on track to deliver data this year.--- Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pfizer-completes-covid-19-trial-with-95-efficacy-to-seek-emergency-use-authorisation-172182

On the basis of this plea, these properties were earlier released from attachment under the NDPS Act in the year 2005,” said a senior agency official.However, on November 6, 2019, the officials said, the ED informed “the correct factual position” to the competent authority and shared “definite and undeniable evidence” of ownership of these properties by Iqbal Mirchi.The evidences, which were gathered by the ED during course of search proceedings under the PMLA, include complete payment receipts issued by the trust along with the corresponding entry in the bank passbook, letter issued by trust regarding handing over the possession to Iqbal Memon, submissions to Income Tax admitting sale of these properties, etc., they said.Based on the evidence provided to it, the competent authority in a fresh order observed that the order dated March 11, 2005 was obtained through fraud, willful suppression of documentary evidence and facts and “is therefore non-est order in eyes of law”, said the officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-ensures-forfeiture-of-assets-in-iqbal-mirchi-case-172175

18-11-2020||Patna||Bihar Opposition attacks Nitish over corruption charges on minister, demands his sacking||Bihar’s main Opposition RJD and its allies on Wednesday attacked Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for appointing Mewalal Choudhary of JD(U) as the Education Minister even though he faces corruption charges and was suspended from the party over the issue, and demanded he be sacked.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav said Choudhary, a former Vice Chancellor of an agriculture university and a first-time minister, faces serious charges under the Indian Penal Code, including cheating and dishonesty (section 420), and criminal conspiracy (120B)."Has Chief Minister Nitish Kumar awarded Mewalal Choudhary for corruption and given him the freedom to loot?" Tejashwi asked in a tweet.Choudhary, 67, was suspended from the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) in 2017 after an FIR was registered against him over alleged irregularities in appointments during his tenure as the Vice Chancellor of the Bihar Agriculture University, Sabour, in Bhagalpur district.The FIR was registered against Choudhary in February 2017 on the basis of a report by the then VC over some anomalies in the appointment of Assistant Professors and junior scientists.भ्रष्टाचार के अनेक मामलों में भगौडे आरोपी को शिक्षा मंत्री बना दिया।अल्पसंख्यक समुदायों में से किसी को भी मंत्री नहीं बनाया।सत्ता संरक्षित अपराधियों की मौज है। रिकॉर्डतोड़ अपराध की बहार है।कुर्सी ख़ातिर Crime, Corruption और Communalism पर मुख्यमंत्री जी प्रवचन जारी रखेंगे।  BJP which was in the opposition during the Grand Alliance government then had strongly raised the issue against Choudhary.Choudhary had left the job to contest the 2015 Bihar polls on a JD(U) ticket and was elected from Tarapur Assembly seat in Munger district. He retained his seat in the just- concluded state polls and has been made the Education Minister.The probe has brought to light alleged irregularities in the appointment of 161 Assistant Professors and Junior Scientists in 2012.Tejashwi also took a swipe at the new NDA government for not appointing any Muslim in the cabinet.They have made an accused, absconding in several cases of corruption, the Education Minister, but there is no minister from the minority community, said Tejashwi.RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who is jailed in fodder scam cases, tweeted that while his son Tejashwi was committed to signing 10 lakh jobs in his first cabinet meeting, if he was voted to power, Nitish made his priorities clear by inducting into his cabinet a person who is facing charges of corruption."Look at the irony, the BJP which was attacking the JD(U) over Mewalal until now, is silent today," Prasad tweeted in Hindi.While he is in jail, Prasad’s Twitter handle is operated by his office in consultation with his family.CPI-ML state secretary Kunal said his party, which has 12 MLAs, would protest against Choudhary from the Day 1 of the new Assembly session, which is on November 23."We want Nitish Kumar to sack him (Choudhary)," he said.Kunal said Choudhary’s appointment as the Education Minister "is an insult to the people of Bihar".Taking a dig at the Chief Minister over his oft-repeated assertions that he would not tolerate three Cs – crime, communalism and corruption – Kunal said, "You keep talking about the three Cs, then what is this? You yourself had suspended him. The case against him is still going on. And you have made a corrupt man the Education Minister.""We are requesting other Mahagathbandhan allies to join our protest. Our student wings will also protest against him," said Kunal.Congress MLC and AICC media panelist Prem Chandra Mishra also tweeted against Choudhary."By making somebody like Mewalal Choudhary the Education Minister, Chief Minister @NitishKumar himself has tarnished his image and hurt his political reputation," Mishra tweeted with the hashtag 'Sack Mewalal' in Hindi.While the minister was not available for comment, his personal assistant Abhishek Kumar said only courts would decide if Choudhary was guilty."The minister has to say that the courts are supreme," said Abhishek. "And if there is any case, only the court can decide whether somebody is guilty or not. There is no need to say anything when the case is sub-judice." Asked if the JD(U) suspending Chouhary was an admission of guilt, Abhishek said, "This is the party's rule that if you face any allegations, you are asked to (leave) for some time."

18-11-2020||New Delhi||Twitter has apologised in writing for ‘Ladakh in China’ error: Lekhi||Social media giant Twitter has apologised in writing to a key parliamentary panel for wrongly showing Ladakh in China and has promised to correct the error by the month-end, the committee’s chairperson Meenakshi Lekhi said on Wednesday.Twitter’s deposition has come in form of an affidavit signed by Damien Karien, Chief Privacy Officer of Twitter Inc, for wrong geo-tagging of India’s map, Lekhi told PTI.Last month, the Joint Committee of Parliament on Data Protection Bill had come down heavily on Twitter for showing Ladakh as part of China, saying it amounted to treason and had sought an explanation by the US-based parent of the social media platform in form of an affidavit.Appearing before the panel, chaired by Lekhi, representatives of Twitter India had “begged apology”, but they were told by the members that it was a criminal offence that questioned the sovereignty of the country and an affidavit must be submitted by Twitter Inc, not by its ‘marketing arm’ Twitter India.“Twitter has now given us a written apology on an affidavit for Ladakh being shown in China,” Lekhi said.“They have apologised for hurting Indian sentiments and have sworn to correct the error by November 30, 2020,” she added.Twitter had come under heavy criticism and faced a backlash from social media users after its geotagging feature displayed “Jammu & Kashmir, the People’s Republic of China” in a live broadcast from Leh’s Hall of Fame, a war memorial for fallen soldiers in the Union Territory of Ladakh.The Indian government on October 22 had warned Twitter about its location setting that showed Leh in China, saying any disrespect towards the country’s sovereignty and integrity is totally unacceptable.In a strongly-worded letter, Ajay Sawhney, Secretary in the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), asked Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to respect the country’s sensitivities, sources in the ministry had said.At that time, Twitter had called it a technical issue that had been swiftly resolved.In its affidavit submitted before the parliamentary panel, Twitter is believed to have said the issue was “caused due to a software error combined with imperfect data resulting in an incorrect geo-tag”.“In the last few weeks, we have worked towards resolving the geo-tag issue in a manner wherein Leh as well as other cities in the Union Territory of Ladakh will now accurately show with their respective city name, state and country.“In addition to this, we are also reviewing the geo-tag for various other cities in Jammu and Kashmir. This work is already in progress and we are targeting November 30, 2020 to complete this exercise,” it added.Twitter further said it wanted to reiterate that India was a priority market and it was committed to partnering with the Government of India and MeitY to serve the public conversation and communities on the micro-blogging site.“Our team in India will continue to engage with the Ministry for any follow-up discussions. We would also like to apologise for any sentiments that were hurt because of this error,” it added.On October 28, Twitter’s India representatives were questioned for more than two hours by the panel members, mainly on Ladakh being shown as part of China on the Twitter app.“The committee was of the unanimous opinion that Twitter’s explanation on showing Ladakh as part of China was inadequate,” Lekhi had said after the meeting.Twitter was also asked about its banning policy, while some members also raised questions about Twitter’s transparency policy and its actions during elections, especially vis-a-vis their policies in other countries.

18-11-2020||Kolkata||Leaders unhappy with Cong’ functioning free to leave: Adhir on Sibal’s remark||Congress Lok Sabha leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Wednesday slammed party colleague Kapil Sibal over his Bihar poll debacle introspection remark, saying those unhappy with the party’s functioning are free to leave instead of embarrassing it in public.Chowdhury stung Sibal for “giving sermons from AC rooms” and said disgruntled members may join other parties or form their own outfits.Wondering why Sibal was not seen campaigning for the Congress during the Bihar elections, the party’s West Bengal chief said, “Speaking without doing anything doesn’t mean introspection.”“Kapil Sibal could have raised the issues inside a party forum instead of making such embarrassing remarks in public. He is a senior leader and has access to the party’s top brass.“Those who are unhappy with the functioning of the party have the freedom to form a new party or join one if they feel that the Congress is not the right place for them,” Chowdhury, a member of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), told reporters here.His comments came in the backdrop of Sibal criticising the Congress leadership for the party’s abysmal performance in the Bihar elections, where it bagged only 19 of the 70 seats it contested.Sibal was part of a group of 23 senior Congress leaders who had written to party chief Sonia Gandhi in August, giving suggestions on ways to revive the grand old party.“He seems to be very concerned about the Congress and its need for introspection. Earlier also he had spoken about it in public. But he was not seen campaigning for the party in the elections in Bihar or other states that went to polls last year.“Instead of giving sermons sitting in AC rooms, he should work on the ground. Lecturing others without doing anything won’t help. Only calling for introspection without doing anything on our own is of no use,” Chowdhury said.After the 2019 poll debacle, Rahul Gandhi stepped down as the party chief and now nobody can question the intention of Rahul Gandhi or Sonia Gandhi. They also offered that someone from outside the Gandhi-Nehru family should lead the party, the Baharampur MP said.Earlier, Rajasthan Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot had criticised Sibal, saying his statements had hurt the sentiments of party workers across the country. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/leaders-unhappy-with-cong-functioning-free-to-leave-adhir-on-sibals-remark-172166

Earlier, these were also used for surveillance during the Chinese incursions at Dokalam in the north-east.In addition to maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare capabilities, P-8I have been deployed to assist during disaster relief and humanitarian missions.“The ninth P-8I is the first aircraft to be delivered under an option contract for four additional aircraft that the Indian Ministry of Defence placed in 2016. The Indian Navy was the first and is the largest international customer for the P-8 and recently completed seven years of operating the fleet,” Boeing said in a statement issued today.“The P-8I, with its exceptional maritime surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, versatility and operational readiness, has proven to be an important asset to the Indian Navy. We remain committed to supporting the modernisation and mission readiness of India’s defence forces,” the statement added.Boeing is also providing training, spares, ground support equipment and field service support to the Indian Navy. It is currently completing construction of the Training Support and Data Handling Centre at INS Rajali in Arakkonam near Chennai, and a secondary centre at the Naval Institute of Aeronautical Technology, Kochi, as part of a training and support package contract signed in 2019.The indigenous, ground-based training will allow the Indian Navy crew to increase mission proficiency in a shorter time while reducing the on-aircraft training time resulting in increased aircraft availability for mission tasking.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/navy-gets-its-ninth-boeing-p-8i-surveillance-aircraft-172162

The RJD emerged as the single largest party with 75 seats in the 243-member Assembly.After the Assembly polls in Maharashtra last year, the BJP won 105 seats, while its then ally Shiv Sena bagged 56.The two parties, however, parted ways following differences over sharing the chief ministerial post.The Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena later joined hands with the NCP and Congress to form government in Maharashtra."The Shiv Sena was not given the chief ministers post in Maharashtra after BJP got more seats. But gave the crown of chief ministers post to the party which was relegated to the third position in Bihar. What generosity! "There will be a shortage of ink to describe this sacrifice in politics," the 'Saamana' editorial said.It said BJP leaders like Chandrakant Patil and Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari are of the view that the state is being run by NCP chief Sharad Pawar."All these (leaders) should keep an eye on who exactly will run Nitish Kumars government in Bihar now on," it said.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sena-taunts-bjp-over-sacrifice-of-giving-cms-post-to-jdu-172128
18-11-2020||New Delhi||India needs to limit carbon emissions: G20 climate report||As the world's leading economies are directing trillions of dollars towards COVID-19 recovery packages, a significant proportion is going to fossil fuel industries without climate-related conditions, risking clean energy opportunities in the coming decade, a G20 climate performance report said on Wednesday.India, it said, is not on track for a 1.5 degrees Celsius world. To be on track, India needs to limit its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to 4.597 MtCO2e by 2030 and below 3.389 MtCO2e by 2050.India can do so by adopting a 'no new coal' policy as well as working on a plan to phase out coal by 2040.India's average death rate per 1,000 due to air pollution is more than 1.7 to 18 times the G20 average.These are among the key findings of the 2020 Climate Transparency Report, an annual collaboration between 14 think tanks, including TERI, and NGOs across G20 countries.This year's report analyses G20 countries' performance across 100 indicators of climate adaptation, mitigation and finance, apart from emission impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and responses by their governments.The year 2019 has seen a remarkable departure from the long-term growth trend in energy-related emissions and a stable expansion of renewables in the G20. But researchers caution that by providing unconditional support to fossil fuels, governments' recovery responses risk reversing, instead of locking in, positive pre-COVID trends.At least 19 of the G20 countries have chosen to provide financial support to their domestic oil, coal and/or gas sectors and 14 countries bailed out their national airline companies without climate conditions attached.Only four G20 countries provided more funding to green sectors compared with fossil fuel or other emissions-intensive industries."The recovery packages can solve the climate crisis or make it worse," said Charlene Watson of the Overseas Development Institute."Some G20 members like the EU, France or Germany are setting mostly a good example for building more resilient economies whilst shielding themselves against the accelerating climate impacts. Others direct too much support to fossil fuels, putting at risk positive recent developments." According to the report, in 2019 energy-related CO2 emissions declined in G20 countries for the first time due to climate policies rather than due to external shocks (such as the 2008-09 financial crisis), namely by 0.1 per cent, down from a 1.9 per cent growth in 2018.Due to the impacts of the pandemic, G20 energy-related CO2 emissions are projected to be 7.5 per cent lower by the end of 2020 compared with 2019.Most notably, global aviation emissions collapsed this year.The share of renewable energy in power generation increased in 19 of the G20 countries in 2019, accounting for 27 per cent of power generation in the G20.It is projected to continue to increase in all G20 countries and will likely make up almost 28 per cent of power generation in 2020.Coal consumption decreased by two per cent. Notably, only five G20 members have set targets to phase out coal, it said."Before the pandemic hit, results of climate action were coming to fruition in some energy-related sectors and the crisis consolidated those trends in a majority of the G20 countries," said Jorge Villarreal of Iniciativa Climatica de Mexico.With China, South Africa, Japan and South Korea the latest to join the race to carbon neutrality by mid-century, the report finds that the momentum behind tougher climate targets among the world's largest emitters is building.However, short-term policy frameworks and investments are not yet consistent with long-term plans.This is despite the fact that climate-related weather extremes such as heatwaves, wildfires and flooding will become more severe in G20 countries as global warming approaches the 1.5 degrees Celsius mark.Among G20 members, Australia, Brazil, France, Italy, Mexico, Turkey, India, Saudi Arabia and South Africa risk greater exposure to climate-related impacts compared with global projections at 1.5 degrees.The analysis also identifies critical differences in how governments are responding to the decarbonisation challenge. For instance, Japan, France, Britain and Canada have set target dates for phasing out fossil fuel cars, while in comparison, the Trump administration rolled back regulations aimed at reducing transport emissions.While 18 of the G20 countries are in the process of or have already implemented carbon-pricing schemes, Australia and India have no such plans.Further, while Canada, France, and Britain have introduced fully restricted public financing for coal, China, India, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa have no restrictions in place."India's transport sector currently accounts for 14 per cent of its energy-related CO2 emissions. As car ownership grows, India should quickly increase the share of EVs and invest in sustainable urban public transport," RR Rashmi from The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) told IANS.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-needs-to-limit-carbon-emissions-g20-climate-report-172125

COVID has not prevented them from supporting cross-border terrorism to kill innocent people and spread religious hatred,” he said, without naming any country.Tirumurti said India calls on those countries to stop spreading antisemitism and hatred and stop dividing the world on the basis of religion."We ask them to look inwards to promote harmony within their own societies, stop sectarian violence and ensure the protection of minorities. We believe it is important for the United Nations to speak decisively and not take sides with one group of religions vis-a-vis the others or justify terrorism in any way," he said.Tirumurti was addressing the virtual high-level event by World Jewish Congress on combating antisemitism.India co-sponsored the online side event, which was held in partnership with the Permanent Mission of Germany to the UN in collaboration with Albania, Argentina, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Israel, Romania, Slovakia and Uruguay.He said India is a country which is home to all major religions of the world and is a nation that has given birth to several religions -- the most prominent of them being Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism."I also come from a country which does not have any trace of anti-semitism,” Tirumurti said, highlighting India's thriving Jewish community that goes back more than 2,000 years.He said the Jewish community is an integral part of the pluralistic fabric of India, and it has enriched this fabric as much as any other community."In this river called Indian civilization, every faith and every denomination is embraced in the framework of our democratic structure, pluralism, harmony and mutual acceptance,” the Indian diplomat said.Tirumurti also highlighted the numerous milestones over the period of 2,000 years of the Jewish community in India -- from the Jewish community being granted sanctuary by the Hindu Maharaja of Cochin Rama Varma in Kerala when it faced persecution from some European powers in the 16th century and the King of Jamnagar Maharaja Digvijaysinhji Ranjitsinhji Jadeja who in 1942 provided refuge and protection to more than 1,000 Polish children, including Jewish children when they were denied entry by other countries, bringing them up as his own.He also spoke about the “dastardly" Mumbai terror attacks in November 2008 carried out by Pakistani terrorists.Tirumurti said the whole of India prayed for baby Moshe Holtzberg, who was saved by his Indian caregiver, Sandra Samuel, when terrorists stormed Nariman House and killed the little baby's father Rabbi Gavriel and mother Rivka, who was five months pregnant at the time.He added that there are many well-known Jewish-Indians who have distinguished themselves in all walks of life, including General J F R Jacob, a national hero in India who led the Eastern Command of the Indian Army during India's victory in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War.The World Jewish Congress held the high-level online event on the role of the UN in combating antisemitism as a side event to the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.Antisemitism poses a threat to democratic values, peace and stability, and the World Jewish Congress has long worked with the United Nations to ensure that the fight against antisemitism is a priority of the UN's human rights agenda, it said in a statement.

18-11-2020||Johannesburg||Indian indenture system as oppressive as African migrant labour system: Premier Sihle Zikalala||The Indian indenture system which was brought to South Africa was as oppressive as the African migrant labour system, KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala said.He was speaking at a commemorative event near Durban, where the first boatload of indentured Indian labourers for sugarcane plantations arrived on November 16, 1860.Many of these labourers settled in the Mount Edgecombe District north of Durban, where the oldest temple in the country--Shri Mariammen Temple--is still popular for religious events.The Premier also referred to the cruel practice of importing migrant Black African labour from neighbouring states as cheap labour for working in mines.Addressing a large gathering at the Shri Mariammen Temple, Zikalala paid tributes to the people who followed those first arrivals and settled in South Africa despite the oppressive conditions rather than returning to India.“We honour the courage, sacrifice and struggle of those 1,52,000 women, men and children. They spawned 1.5 million proud South Africans of Indian heritage,” he said.Commending the community for building its own schools, temples, mosques and churches, Zikalala said the indigenous communities had worked side by side with the Indians to build a proud nation, united in its diversity.“We must continue to cherish the times we have come together and stood together,” the Premier said as he recalled the contributions of leaders from both the African and Indian communities who had fought apartheid to achieve the democracy that Nelson Mandela ushered in 1994 after becoming the country's first democratically-elected president.“That history of struggle has equipped us to deal with the present-day challenges that confront our sixth administration in a democratic South Africa. We must however always be looking forward,” he said.Zikalala also cautioned against complacency in his government's attempts to bring about social cohesion between communities.“We cannot take our unity for granted. Unity will not come about simply because we proclaim it. We must work hard for equity, social justice and ensuring that all our people have a place in the sun.“We want to be a united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous society,” he said.“This anniversary of indenture must be an occasion for us to remember, reflect and restore. Let us use this historic moment in time to reach out to each other. Let us celebrate the triumph over the adversity of indenture and participate fully in the building of our non-racial democracy,” the Premier added.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-indenture-system-as-oppressive-as-african-migrant-labour-system-premier-sihle-zikalala-172109

This would not only bring more employment opportunities to Bihar residents but also open more avenues for business growth,” said businessman Rajiv Akhaury. More Special Economic Zones and smart cities should be established to promote exports and attract companies to establish their units, he said.  “During the 17th century, Patna (Bihar's capital) was the centre of international trade. We need to bring back the same era,” Akhaury added.  Entrepreneur Anurag Kumar said he would like to see how the Bihar government engages the non-resident Indians (NRIs) to help in the growth of business, education and exports.   “We would like to have an NRI cell where we can have direct access to find the opportunity and engage in the success of Bihar,” Kumar said. Software professional Pravin Dwivedi urged the new government to work on industrialisation, good governance and healthcare for all.Nitish Kumar was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Bihar for the seventh time in two decades.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihari-nris-congratulate-nitish-kumar-offer-help-in-development-of-state-172092

We reiterated our firm commitment to the Indo-US strategic partnership and discussed our shared priorities and concerns - the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific Region,” the PM posted on social media shortly before midnight.Spoke to US President-elect @JoeBiden on phone to congratulate him. We reiterated our firm commitment to the Indo-US strategic partnership and discussed our shared priorities and concerns - Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, and cooperation in the Indo-Pacific Region.  The PM also conveyed “warm congratulations” for Harris whose success is a matter of “great pride and inspiration for members of the vibrant Indian-American community, who are a tremendous source of strength for the Indo-US relations,” wrote Modi.Biden thanked the PM for his congratulations and expressed his desire to strengthen and expand the US-India strategic partnership alongside the first vice president of South Asian descent.Biden noted that he looks forward to working closely with PM Modi on “shared global challenges” with the Biden-Harris Transition Team’s readout of the phone call listing some of the priorities. They included containing Covid, tackling climate change, launching the global economic recovery, strengthening democracy at home and abroad, and maintaining a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. The pecking orderThe scheduling of phone calls gives an idea about the US President elect’s preference of nations he will do business with. Though PM Modi congratulated Biden around the same time as others, Biden has already spoken a week back with the leaders of Germany, France and the UK; followed by conversations with the leaders of Japan, South Korea and Australia.Besides Modi, Biden took part in congratulatory calls around the same time with leaders of Chile, Israel and South Africa. Significantly, Biden preferred Chile President Sebastián Piñera over Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro who is aligned with Trump’s worldview on most matters of global importance.Biden reserved a special gesture for Israel, speaking to both its President Reuven Rivlin and PM  Benjamin Netanyahu, reiterating his support for Israel’s security and looking forward to “addressing the many challenges confronting our countries”.With Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, Biden spoke of jointly tackling corruption, containing and deepening America’s partnership with African institutions, governments and citizens.Biden though has not spoken with other major world leaders such as Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

It is in India’s strategic and economic interests to be a part of the process of Asia-Pacific integration. The withdrawal has negated years of persuasive negotiations for India to be accepted as part of RCEP. We could have negotiated safeguards to protect our interests. Keeping out of the RCEP is a backward leap,” Sharma said even when the Congress was the first party to express concerns last year over India joining the trade block with Rahul Gandhi even tweeting against the move.Nothing was known officially of the discussions at the meeting of the Congress panel which Sonia had earlier formed to advise her, but it is learnt that the panel discussed the current political situation, including Bihar poll results, upcoming district development council elections in J&K and rumblings in the party.Sonia was not part of the meeting nor was Ahmed Patel, who is ill.

18-11-2020||United Nations||Security Council has become ‘impaired’ organ of UN: India||A handful of countries are using the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN) as a “smoke-screen” and stopping progress on reforming the Security Council, which has become “impaired”, India has said, asserting that it is time for a “decisive movement” to achieve the long-delayed reform of the powerful UN body.Delhi slams Pak for ‘irresponsible’ remarksIndia has slammed Pakistan for making ‘irrelevant and irresponsible’ remarks in the UN, saying the General Assembly is a forum for serious debate, not frivolous allegations. Pakistan’s Ambassador to UN Munir Akram made references to the LoC as he voiced opposition to India’s UNSC membership. “I don’t wish to waste the time of this Assembly by responding to the irresponsible remarks by the representative of Pak, which becomes ‘Pavlovian’ whenever India is mentioned,” India’s envoy TS Tirumurti said. PTIIndia’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador TS Tirumurti, speaking in the UN General Assembly on “Question of equitable representation on and increase in the membership of the Security Council”, lamented that nothing has moved for more than a decade in the IGN except hearing passionate statements on the need for reform.“Today’s Security Council is an impaired organ. It has been unable to act with credibility essentially due to its unrepresentative nature. But then, what is happening inside the IGN process, which we seem to be wedded to?” Tirumurti said on Monday.Criticising the absence of even a single negotiating text, Tirumurti said the IGN had become like a “platform for debate in a university rather than a serious result-oriented process in the United Nations consisting of sovereign member states”.“And why have we come to this pass? Because just a handful of countries don’t want us to proceed. The conditions they are laying out are impossible to fulfill. Ironically, this is happening at a time when we were in a tearing hurry last week to give ourselves e-voting rights. But for IGN, they want no voting, leave alone e-voting, but only full consensus!” he said.Asserting that there is a need for a decisive movement this year in the UNSC reform process, Tirumurti said: “Without decisive movement, I feel that those who support real reform and who wish to deliver on the commitment made by our leaders will be forced to look beyond the IGN, maybe to this very Assembly, for results. If that happens, we must not hesitate in taking a relook at the IGN process itself.”He said since there had been no progress for a decade, the IGN had not only been informal, but had no rules of procedure or records, forcing nations to keep their own notes and placing a tremendous burden on all small and medium states.India will join the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member for a two-year term beginning January 1. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/security-council-has-become-impaired-organ-of-un-india-171862

Though both sides are silent on the matter, there are talks of a possible one-on-one meeting between Shah and Alagiri.While Alagiri has been looking for avenues to resurrect his political career after being sidelined by Stalin, the BJP too is looking for suitable partners to realise its expansion dreams in the southern state. Reports suggest that Alagiri is preparing to launch a political outfit called “Kalaignar DMK” or “KDMK”.While rivals dismiss Alagiri as “inconsequential” and the BJP as a “political lightweight”, observers say for the saffron party which has no major political base in Tamil Nadu, any “help” will be welcome.Besides, superstar Rajinikanth continues to be elusive and friction with the AIADMK is widening over the “Vetrivel Yatra”.A recent meeting between RSS ideologue Gurumurthy and Rajinikanth had drawn much interest.The “Vel Yatra” is an attempt by the BJP to consolidate Hindu votes in the state where its vote share dropped from 5.56 per cent in 2014 to 3.66 per cent in 2019.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tie-ups-on-mind-amit-shah-to-visit-chennai-on-nov-21-171868

The top court asked the Centre to create a mechanism to address grievances against fake news circulated by TV channels and media.“What is shown on TV channels is of great consequence for the country... Create a mechanism under the law if there is none at present,” the Bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta after he submitted that there was no regime for content regulation of electronic media.The CJI’s observations came during a hearing on PILs filed by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and Peace Party seeking directions to the Centre to stop dissemination of “fake news”.The petitioners demanded strict action against TV channels allegedly spreading communal hatred against Muslims by stating that Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi in March was responsible for the spread of Covid-19.The Centre refuted the petitioners’ allegations that media was largely communal in reporting the incident.In an affidavit filed in the top court, the Centre said the IT Ministry had issued 743 orders for blocking fake or misleading content on social media related to Covid-19.But the Bench wasn’t happy with the Centre’s affidavit. “We had asked you to specify how Cable TV Network Act can be used to control the content of cable TV network. Your affidavit is silent on it. Other issue is what steps you can take to deal with such complaints.... the mechanism... Your affidavit is silent on it. Please put all these in your amended affidavit. The Centre has the power under the Act,” the Bench told Mehta.“If you have no mechanism evolve one or we will entrust it to an outside agency,” the CJI said. Noting that the NBA and the NBSA were self-regulatory bodies, Mehta said the Centre had ample powers to regulate content of TV channels but it took a very cautious approach as it involved media’s fundamental right to free speech.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/self-regulation-wont-do-sc-wants-rules-for-tv-channels-171843
