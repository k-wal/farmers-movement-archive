24-09-2020||New Delhi||New CAG report admits ‘technology transfer’ was shelved in Rafale offsets: Congress||The Congress on Thursday said the new CAG report admits that “technology transfer” was shelved in Rafale offsets and wondered whether the report opens a can of worms.Congress leader P Chidambaram said, “The CAG finds that the vendors of the Rafale aircraft have not confirmed the transfer of technology under the offset contract.”          “The offset obligations should have started on 23-9-2019 and the first annual commitment should have been completed by 23-9–2020, that is yesterday. Will the government say if that obligation was fulfilled,” he asked in a tweet.“Is the CAG report the opening of a can of worms,” he further asked.The government has always maintained that there has been no irregularity in the Rafale deal signed by it.Raising the issue, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted, “Chronology of biggest Defense deal continues to unfold. The new CAG report admits that ‘technology transfer’ shelved in Rafale offsets. 1st, ‘Make in India’ became ‘Make in France’. Now, DRDO dumped for tech transfer. Modi ji will say - ‘Sab Changa si’ (all is well).”  At the party briefing, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said that as per the CAG report, the work on offsets is being done in the seventh year and the vendor would not do anything on offsets for the first six years.He said the Congress has raised the issue in the country’s interest.The Comptroller and Auditor General in its report released on Wednesday said that French aerospace major Dassault Aviation and European missile maker MBDA are yet to fulfil their offset obligations of offering high technology to India under the Rafale aircraft deal.The Dassault Aviation is the manufacturer of the Rafale jets while the MBDA supplied the missile systems for the aircraft.India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 to procure 36 Rafale jets at a cost of Rs 59,000 crore, and the offset obligations were part of the contract.In its report tabled in Parliament, the national auditor said the Dassault Aviation and the MBDA proposed in September 2015 to discharge 30 per cent of their offset obligations by offering high technology to the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), but the two firms are yet to do it.

24-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Court dismisses interim bail plea of man in Head Constable’s death case||A Delhi court on Thursday dismissed a plea of a man, arrested in a case related to the death of Head Constable Ratan Lal during the February riots in north east Delhi, seeking interim bail for 11 days to perform post-death ceremonies of his father.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav rejected the application of Mohd Ayyub seeking interim bail from September 30 to October 10 and said he has already availed the benefit of interim bail twice in the matter.During the hearing, Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, opposed the bail application, saying that the misuse of the interim bail granted to accused persons in the riots cases on “humanitarian grounds” was quite prevalent.The public prosecutor said the accused seek interim bails on “humanitarian grounds” for a very short period and before its expiry, they file an application seeking its extension on the ground that the Delhi High Court has extended all the interim bails during COVID-19 pandemic till October 31.“In case, this court dismisses such applications, then they do not hesitate to approach the Delhi High Court and several orders have been received in such cases from the Delhi High Court, whereby interim bails have been extended treating these bails to the ‘COVID bails’,” the public prosecutor said.The court said the offences against Ayyub were quite serious in nature.“It is further a matter of record that the applicant (Ayyub) has already availed the benefit of interim bail twice in the matter and his other three brothers can very well perform the remaining post-death ceremonies of his deceased father,” it said in its order.Prasad submitted that the state has already approached the High Court by way of a petition, seeking clarification on whether riots cases came under the purview of the High Court’s order on extension of interim bails till October 31.He informed the court that the matter was pending.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

24-09-2020||New Delhi||India has asked Pak to ensure minority communities’ security: MEA on Sikh girl’s abduction||India lodged a strong protest with Pakistan over the abduction of a Sikh girl in that country and has conveyed to Islamabad that it should take all steps for ensuring the security of minority communities, the Ministry of External Affairs said on Thursday.Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said there was a lot of anger and concern among the Sikh community over the abduction of the Sikh girl in Pakistan and the community had made a representation to the ministry over the issue.“The ministry lodged a strong protest by summoning a senior (Pakistani) diplomat and gave a note verbale. This is not the first incident and such incidents have happened in the past as well,” Srivastava said.“There are some reports that the girl has been released. We have told the Pakistan government that they should take all steps for ensuring the security of the minority communities,” he said at an online briefing.According to reports, the Sikh girl was abducted from Panja Sahib region of Punjab province recently.Last month also, India raised with Pakistan the incident of a Sikh girl being forcibly converted to Islam in Punjab province.To another question about India’s charge d’affaires-designate not being granted visa by Pakistan, Srivastava said the Pakistani side had some reservations about India’s CDA-designate, and added that this was an “administrative issue” which the ministry was handling.On the Kulbhushan Jadhav case, Srivastava said all efforts were being made to ensure his safe return to India.Asked about Turkey raising Kashmir at the UN, Srivastava said, “You would have seen the right of reply exercised by our Permanent Mission in New York where we have stated inter alia that the remarks of the President of Republic of Turkey on the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir constitute a gross interference in India’s internal affairs and are completely unacceptable.”“Turkey should learn to respect the sovereignty of other nations and reflect on its own policies more deeply,” Srivastava said.

They were re-arrested a few days later when new IPC sections were added against them, but again released on bail by a local court.The Sena had said the attack on Sharma can not be justified, but at the same time criticised him over the cartoon ridiculing the Chief Minister.

Why don’t you file a regular bail application?” the Bench told Grover, noting that her bail plea was pending in the Bombay High Court.Bharadwaj (58) had earlier moved the Bombay High Court seeking bail, saying that she suffered from chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. She has been lodged in the Byculla women’s prison since September 2018 following her arrest.The case pertains to the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune district on December 31, 2017.

24-09-2020||New Delhi||Over 200 educationists, filmmakers and authors demand release of Umar Khalid||More than 200 educationists, filmmakers and authors, including Noam Chomsky and Mira Nair, issued a joint statement on Wednesday demanding the Centre free Umar Khalid arrested in connection with the northeast Delhi riots.Besides Chomsky and Nair, the signatories include actor Ratna Pathak Shah, authors Amitav Ghosh, Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy, and journalist P Sainath.“We call on the Government of India to free Umar Khalid and all those falsely implicated and unjustly incarcerated for protesting against the CAA-NRC that denies equal citizenship rights and to ensure that the Delhi Police investigates the Delhi riots with impartiality under the oath they took as public servants bound by the Constitution of India,” the statement read.Khalid has been arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a case related to the communal violence in northeast Delhi in February this year.“We stand in solidarity and outrage, with the brave young scholar and activist Umar Khalid, arrested in New Delhi on September 14, 2020, under fabricated charges of engineering the Delhi riots in February 2020,” the statement said.The statement said that Khalid “used the passion of his commitment to his country, marshalled his education and his voice to join the movement for equal citizenship, against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)” which introduced religion as a criterion for citizenship, and has no place in a secular nation.The Delhi Police had on September 13 said it is investigating the role of all individuals who took part in the February riots and were behind the larger conspiracy of organising violence and inciting communal passion amongst communities.Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava had last week said the force has collected documentary evidence, including scientific evidence, to support its case in connection with the riots.He said the police have so far arrested 1,571 people irrespective of their caste or religion and they are almost equally distributed among both communities.Responding to former IPS officer Julio Ribeiro’s letter in which he had questioned the Delhi police’s investigation, Srivastava had said there are several entities who have their reasons to weave a “web of deception” and push a “false narrative of bias and insensitivity” on the part of the police.He said police investigations in criminal cases are guided by facts and evidence, not by reputations and personalities.“Delhi Police are serving the oath and the Constitution with conviction, integrity and sensitivity, without fear of any self-proclaimed “true patriots” or favour towards any class, creed or community,” Srivastava had said in an email reply to Ribeiro.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between those supporting the citizenship law and those opposing it spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-200-educationists-filmmakers-and-authors-demand-release-of-umar-khalid-145953
24-09-2020||---||MEA takes hope from consensus at military commanders’ meeting||New Delhi, September 24India on Thursday highlighted the fact that the latest meeting of military commanders had led to a joint press release. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) interpreted it as reflecting the “stated commitment of both sides to disengage along the LAC”. While noting that this is the first joint press release after any Senior Commanders’ meeting, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava also noted that the meeting took place after nearly 50 days.The latest Senior Commanders’ meeting was critical to ensure stability on the ground at a time when troops are about to undertake disengagement which is a complex process requiring redeployment towards regular posts on the respective sides of the LAC, said Srivastava.The meeting had undertaken not to add to troops’ strength on the border and not to unilaterally change the status quo of the border. These steps were essential in view of two past instances of extreme aggression that led to shots being fired on the LAC for the first time in 45 years.The MEA also noted that the Senior Commanders’ meeting took place against the backdrop of two high level Sino-India Ministerial meetings in Moscow on September 4 and 10. The September 10 Foreign Ministers’ meeting, which had produced a joint statement as well as two different interpretations of the outcome by India and China, had expressed the desire to continue the dialogue and ensure quick and comprehensive disengagement in all the friction areas.It is unusual for the Foreign Office to comment on the meeting of Senior Military Commanders although the last round of talks was not a purely military affair and included representation from the MEA.After summarising the consensus achieved at that meeting, Srivastava hoped the way ahead will be to refrain from making any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo, while the two sides continue their discussions to achieve complete disengagement in all friction areas.In this regard, he said, the two sides have also decided to have the next meeting of the Senior Commanders at the earliest as well as hold in parallel a meeting of the inter-Ministerial MEA-led Working Mechanism on Consultation and Coordination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mea-takes-hope-from-consensus-at-military-commanders-meeting-145952

24-09-2020||New Delhi||Second wave of COVID-19 has hit its peak in Delhi, number of cases to decline in coming days: Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic has hit its peak in the national capital with experts hinting that the cases of infection will decline in the coming days.He said the government was “keeping its fingers crossed” and hoped that COVID-19 cases will “gradually” come down due to the steps taken by the AAP dispensation.Delhi has been witnessing a surge in the number of coronavirus cases in the last few days.“All the experts believe that the second wave (of coronavirus), which had come in Delhi, appears to have hit its peak. Now, the cases will come down in the coming days,” Kejriwal told reporters.COVID-19 cases in the city were by and large under control between July 1 and August 17 and on an average, 1,100-1,200 new cases were being reported every day, he said.“From August 17, the cases rose slightly from around 1,100 to 1,500 and as a responsible government, we did not take any risk and immediately scaled up testing from around 20,000 to 60,000 tests per day.“The best way to defeat coronavirus is to conduct aggressive testing to identify and isolate positive cases,” the chief minister said.He said coronavirus cases have increased in Delhi because testing was massively scaled up.“The daily cases were around 4,500 on September 16 which have now started coming down and currently, there are around 3,700 cases (daily),” Kejriwal said.According to the CM, if the testing would have scaled down to the previous level of 20,000 tests per day, the cases would also have come down to around 1,500 per day in the city.Kejriwal hoped that the steps taken by the government, including increasing the number of containment zones from 550 in mid-August to around 2,000 now, will gradually bring down the number of COVID-19 positive cases in the coming days.Earlier this month, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain had said it couldn’t be said that the national capital was witnessing a second wave of COVID-19.On September 7, Jain had said the sharp spike in coronavirus cases in the national capital will “plateau” after ten days or so and asserted that the home isolation policy has proved to be a “game changer” in taming the surge, a strategy the city government would continue to pursue.On Wednesday, Delhi recorded 3,714 fresh COVID-19 cases as the infection tally in the city mounted to over 2.56 lakh, while the death toll rose to 5,087.More than 60,000 COVID-19 tests were conducted in the city on Tuesday, according to the bulletin issued by the Delhi health department on Wednesday.The total number of active cases, as on Wednesday, stood at 30,836, it said.

The attack on the police station had resulted in huge damage and destruction of public and government property, they said.The officials said the searches were also conducted at 30 locations in Bengaluru city to unearth the conspiracy behind the attacks on DJ Halli and KG Halli police stations. “During searches airgun, pellets, sharp weapons, iron rods, digital devices, DVRs and many SDPI & PFI related incriminating documents and material were recovered,” a senior NIA official said.On September 23, 2020 following an order from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), NIA took up the investigation in the two Bengaluru violence cases which the Karnataka police had registers under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Prevention of Damage to Public property Act, Karnataka Prevention of Destruction and Loss of Property Act and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act – UAPA.“These cases pertain to mob violence post a derogatory social media remark by one Naveen, nephew of Srinivas Akhanda Murthy, a sitting Congress MLA, (Pulakeshi Nagar, Bengaluru) allegedly insulting the religious sentiments of Muslims,” the official said.The State Secretary, Social Democratic Party of India, Muzamil Pasha and other members of Social Democratic Party of India/Popular Front of India gathered a mob at the houses of Naveen, Srinivas Murthy and at the premises of DJ Halli and KG Halli police stations, who vandalised the premises and resorted to arson, creating fear and panic among the masses, the officials said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-arrests-key-conspirator-of-bengaluru-violence-conducts-searches-at-30-locations-145944
24-09-2020||Chandigarh||CAG points out decline in NCZ area in NCR, delay in its mapping||Passing strictures on the poor functioning of National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB), the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) pointed out decline in Natural Conservation Zone (NCZ) area in NCR and delay in its delineation. The report was tabled before the Parliament on September 23.The NCR presently comprises 14 districts of Haryana, entire Delhi, eight districts of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and two of Rajasthan.    Major natural features, identified as environmentally sensitive areas, like the extension of Aravali ridge in Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi; forest areas; the rivers and tributaries of major rivers; sanctuaries; major lakes and water bodies were demarcated as NCZ in the Regional Plan-2021.The Regional Plan (RP)-2021, which was notified in 2005, after a delay of three and half years, had tentative boundaries of NCZ as it was prepared on basis of satellite imagery of 1999 without ground truthing.When Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change raised the issue of mapping and delineation of forests and other ecologically sensitive areas in 2014, the NCRPB took the decision of delineation by each participating state based on ground truthing and verification of state revenue records. But it had not been completed even till September 2018, observed the CAG.  The NCRPB and the Union Environment Ministry accepted the audit observation.“The fact remains that delay in delineation of NCZ has resulted in non-finalisation of Sub Regional Plan (SRP) of Haryana and Revised Regional Plan (RRP) 2021 and adverse implications for environmental issues,” said the CAG. The CAG found that as per the analysis in June 2015 of the NCRPB, there was a decline in NCZ vis-a-vis figures contained in the RP-2021- decline in respect of Delhi was 15.43 per cent, while it was 43.88 per cent in UP, 25.97 per cent in case of Haryana and 11.18 per cent in case of Rajasthan. “…there has been no improvement in the green area and NCZ in NCR. In fact, the position has deteriorated over a period of time. The lack of effectiveness of the Board is thus self-evident,” said the CAG report. The CAG has pointed out that in case of “construction of Medical College with Teaching Hospital” in Mewat, Haryana, the NCRPB released two instalments of loan amounting to Rs 113.33 crore in 2010, despite environmental clearance and conversion of land use being pending. The project which was to be completed by May 2011 was completed in May 2015.  Also, for “Water Supply Scheme for Nalhar Medical College and Nuh Town” the NCRPB did not ensure availability of requisite land prior to releasing the loan of Rs 90.13 crore.The project of four-laning of five roads in Rewari took six years more but no liquidated damages were levied as there was no such clause in the loan agreement, said the CAG report. The Project Sanctioning and Monitoring Group (PSMG) granted assistance of Rs 1,648.37 crore, out of which Rs 1,562.93 crore was given to Haryana, in respect of those projects for which the SRPs were not formulated by the participating states. While revising the RP 2021, the NCRPB accepted and incorporated “tourism in the forest areas” in January 2014 as per the proposals of Haryana, despite objections. Subsequently, the Environment Ministry had raised objection in March 2014 and the NCRPB had to roll it back in April 2014. “This indicates undue benefit to the Govt. of Haryana with adverse ramification for the entire NCR,” said the CAG.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cag-points-out-decline-in-ncz-area-in-ncr-delay-in-its-mapping-145941
24-09-2020||---||Day before ‘Bharat bandh’, Tomar slams ‘Cong lies’, assures farmers on 3 agri-legislations||New Delhi, September 24 A day before countrywide farmers’ agitation, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday accused the Congress of “lying and misleading” while assuring farmers that the three “historic” agri-legislations passed by the Parliament were for their “better future and prosperity in the agriculture sector”.Slamming the Congress “for doing petty politics on matter related to farmers’ future even while it promised very same reforms in its poll manifestos,” Tomar also said “if farmers want any discussion on the bills, they are most welcome, our doors are always open”.Notably several farmers and farm-worker, including the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), have given a call for a ‘Bharat Bandh’ on September 25. Terming the legislations “undemocratic and anti-farmer”, Indian Coordination Committee of Farmers Movements (ICCFM) national convener Yudhvir Singh said farmers will observe complete ‘bandh’ in protest against the Central government’s move. The ICCFM is a non-partisan national alliance of farmers movements representing 12 farmers’ organisations across India based in UP, MP, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Haryana, Singh said. “We oppose both the process and the substance of these bills. When seen in totality, these bills have nothing to do with improving farmers’ incomes, over 80% of who are small and marginal farmers. Instead, they will empower agribusiness and increase corporate control of our food systems, leaving farmers and consumers with little recourse to justice,” he added. However, according to Tomar, the legislations will change the lives of farmers and the sector for the better. “Check the records and see what Kamal Nath (former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister) had said at the high-level chief minister’ meeting. He (Kamal Nath) said it on record that Essential Commodities Act has achieved its purpose. What the government has done is what the Congress promised in Punjab and in its 2019 Lok Sabha manifesto. The party should stop lying and doing politics on matters concerning farmers,” Tomar said while speaking to mediapersons at the BJP headquarters.Reiterating the BJP-led NDA’s commitment on the MSP and the APMC, Tomar said private players at the village level will help and encourage small farmers grow high-value produce. “The Narendra Modi government is committed to farmers and agriculture,” Tomar said, assuring farmers “complete freedom and better prospects” in a “tax-free environment”. “Farmers will gain…you will see what all happens because of increased competition...The Punjab government has already reduced tax on basmati rice,” he said. “Those who are questioning why MSP has not been included in the legislations are those who ruled the country for past 50 years and still did not make a law on it. Why did you (the Congress-led UPA) not make a rule on the MSP,” Tomar questioned, adding that the minimum support price is an administrative decision of the Centre and will remain.“The proof is the announcement of Rabi MSP even before sowing. During the debate in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition parties did not have any objection to any provision in the legislations, their only objection was on something (MSP) which is not even their part,” Tomar said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/day-before-bharat-bandh-tomar-slams-cong-lies-assures-farmers-on-3-agri-legislations-145939
24-09-2020||Mumbai||CBI, and not NCB, should probe drugs case: Rhea Chakraborty to Bombay High Court||The counsel for actor Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik told the Bombay High Court Thursday the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), that is probing a drugs case related to the death of filmstar Sushant Singh Rajput, had no jurisdiction to initiate the inquiry.Their counsel Satish Maneshinde told the HC that the drugs case, in which Rhea and Showik are accused and currently in jail, should have been transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), probing Rajput's death, by the NCB.The HC did not pass any order on the bail pleas of the Chakrabortys and suggested the NCB file a reply by Monday (September 28).Rhea and Showik have been booked by the NCB under various sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, including stringent sections pertaining to procurement of drugs, and financing of illicit trafficking of contrabands.The siblings, currently in judicial custody, approached the HC earlier this week challenging the orders of a special NDPS court in the city that had rejected their bail pleas.Maneshinde told a single bench presided over by Justice Sarang Kotwal that the Supreme Court, while hearing the pleas seeking a CBI probe into the alleged suicide of Rajput, had ruled that all cases related to the death would be investigated by the CBI."The CBI, that is already investigating the death case, is also empowered to probe cases under the NDPS Act," Maneshinde maintained."Therefore, the NCB should have transferred the probe to the CBI after the offences under the NDPS Act were registered," he said.The lawyer contended both Rhea and Showik should not have been booked under the stringent section 27A of the NDPS Act.The section pertains to financing illicit traffic of drugs and provides for imprisonment of up to 10 years on conviction.However, Rhea, Showik, and almost all other persons arrested in the case have maintained in their bail pleas that the NCB has seized only 59 grams of drugs, which cannot be termed as of commercial quantity, and therefore, they shouldn't have been booked under 27A.Rhea (28) has said in her bail plea that she had occasionally paid for some small quantities of drugs that had been consumed only by Rajput, her boyfriend.And such payment can not be termed as financing illicit trafficking of drugs, the actress has said.Justice Kotwal directed Maneshinde and the NCB's counsel, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, to elaborate on the next hearing date, the law on invoking section 27A in the present case and whether or not an embargo on granting of bail can be applicable to those booked under it.The judge tagged the present matters with the bail pleas filed by Rajput's aides Dipesh Sawant and Samuel Miranda, and alleged drug dealer Abdul Parihar, all co-accused in the NCB's case.These pleas will be heard together on September 29.Justice Kotwal also suggested that the NCB file an affidavit replying to the bail pleas filed byRhea and Showik by Monday.Rajput (34) was found hanging in his home in suburban Bandra on June 14.

24-09-2020||New Delhi||CBI carries out searches in Tamil Nadu in cash-for-votes case during 2019 polls, registers FIR||The CBI on Thursday carried out searches at three locations in Vellore in Tamil Nadu after registering an FIR in the 2019 cash-for-vote scandal in the district during Lok Sabha elections that had led to cancellation of polls in the constituency, officials said.The searches were conducted at the premises of M Dayanidhi, the then senior manager of Canara Bank, Vellore branch, and two private persons Damodaran and Srinivasan in connection with the case, they said. The trio have been booked by the agency in its FIR registered on September 22, on the basis of “reliable information”, related to the recovery of Rs 11.48 crore in newly-printed Rs 200 notes by Income Tax department on April 1, 2019 from the cement godown of Damodaran which were issued from the currency chest of the Canara Bank branch, they said.Srinivasan, a relative of Damodaran, had allegedly claimed that this cash was his own and was meant for distribution to voters in Vellore constituency during the parliamentary elections scheduled on April 18, 2019.After receiving information from tax authorities, the Election Commission had cancelled the election.It is learnt that the cash in the bundles of Rs 200 denomination was obtained from Canara Bank’s currency chest in exchange for other currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 2000 denomination, the agency has alleged.It is alleged that Dayanidhi facilitated the exchange by inducing another public servant and falsifying the accounts to obtain the bundles of Rs 200 notes abusing his official position as a public servant by violating the laid down rules and procedures of the Canara Bank.“Dayanidhi, being a public servant, in criminal conspiracy with other accused persons committed an act of criminal misconduct by extending undue favour to the other accused private persons Damodaran and Srinivasan. The currency was obtained for facilitating easy distribution of currency notes to the voters in the Vellore parliamentary constituency during the parliamentary election which was to be held on April 18, 2019 in turn promotes corruption,” the CBI said in the FIR. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-carries-out-searches-in-tamil-nadu-in-cash-for-votes-case-during-2019-polls-registers-fir-145932
24-09-2020||---||India, Pak clash again over Kashmir||New Delhi, September 24India-Pakistan dynamics continued to overshadow regional forums as Islamabad raised the Kashmir issue during a 27-country meeting of foreign ministers, while New Delhi spoke about impediments to regional cooperation without naming Pakistan at a meeting of SAARC Foreign Ministers.Pakistan refrained from raising bilateral issues at the SAARC Foreign Ministers meeting chaired by Nepal. But it raised the Kashmir issue at another regional meeting of Foreign Ministers held on Thursday under the CICA format.Pakistan and some of its fellow travellers, principally Turkey and Malaysia, have chosen to be irredentist over Kashmir at several multilateral forums even though convention bars them from raising strictly bilateral issues.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar sought to turn the tables by listing the three key challenges that have inhibited SAARC from achieving a fraction of its potential—cross-border terrorism, blocking connectivity and obstructing trade. Though Jaishankar did not mention Pakistan, it is universally acknowledged that Pakistan Army has been discouraging connectivity and trade while encouraging border terrorism.“Only then will we see enduring peace, prosperity and security in our South Asia region,” he said.For most of the conference, individual ministers spent most of their allotted time in stressing on the need for a regional approach to stop the spread of Covid and highlighting their country’s efforts in this direction.While SAARC saw countries eschewing bilateral agendas, another virtual meeting of foreign ministers saw Pakistan raking up the Kashmir issue with India exercising its right to reply to rebut its claims and charges.The two countries were participating in the 27-member Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA). It may be recalled that at last year’s CICA summit, Turkish President Recep Tayypi Erdogan had touched on Kashmir.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-pak-clash-again-over-kashmir-145926

Its price competitiveness makes it high in demand, as the price of illicit opium produced in north-eastern states and smuggled through Indo-Pak international borders are always on the higher side,” said a senior NCB official.He said in the recent past, NCB and other concerned agencies including the Jharkhand Police have destroyed acres of opium fields, but it was difficult to establish links with Naxal outfits in opium cultivation.However, the agency recently initiated a systemic investigation to ascertain the financial trail and explore any possible Naxal connection in recent seizures, the official said, adding: “Hotspot districts for illicit cultivation of opium are Chatra, Khunti, Latehar and Palamu in Jharkhand. Till date, no such name (Naxal outfit) has appeared, but the region is mostly Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jharkhand-new-hotspot-of-illicit-opium-cultivation-ncb-145909

24-09-2020||New Delhi||Major improvement in air quality in Delhi's pollution hotspots during lockdown: CPCB||Air quality in Delhi's 13 pollution hotspots improved significantly due to restrictions on industrial operations and commercial and vehicular activity during the lockdown, according to the Central Pollution Control Board.The Delhi government has identified 13 pollution hotspots in the city based on the annual average of PM10 and PM2.5 levels. These are Okhla Phase-II, Dwarka, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Narela, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, Wazirpur, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, R K Puram and Jahangirpuri.PM2.5 is tiny particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter. It can enter deep into the lungs and even into the bloodstream.The CPCB said it analyzed air quality data in three stages — pre-lockdown (March 1-21), lockdown phase-I (March 25 – April 19) and lockdown phase-II (April 20 – May 3). A comparative analysis was also done for the corresponding time periods in 2019 to assess the improvement."Noticeable reduction in PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 levels in hotspots of Delhi was observed during the lockdown period as compared to 2019 levels, in all likelihood due to restrictions on operations of industrial and commercial areas and vehicular activity," it said.The reduction in PM2.5 levels varied from 54 percent in Jahangirpuri to 26 percent in Punjabi Bagh.Dwarka, which has a significant presence of residential-cum-institutional sites with substantial traffic movement, recorded a 50 percent decline in PM2.5 levels."It affirms that traffic restrictions and closure of commercial areas were instrumental in improving air quality," the CPCB said.Restrictions on operations of industries in Mundka led to a 38 percent reduction in PM2.5 levels in the first phase of lockdown."Even though there were data gaps for Anand Vihar and Narela, considerable reduction in PM2.5 levels was observed for the days on which data was available," the report read.PM10 levels in the hotspots of Dwarka, Mundka, Wazirpur declined by over 60 per cent during the lockdown periods."This may be attributed to reduced road dust re-suspension due to minimal vehicular movement and restriction on construction and demolition activities," the apex pollution body said.Sizeable improvement in NO2 levels was observed across the hotspots as compared to 2019 levels, except Jahangirpuri.Other areas such as Rohini, Ashok Vihar and R K Puram witnessed over 70 percent reduction in NO2 levels during the lockdown periods as against 2019 levels, primarily due to reduced vehicular activity.

The seven- hour-long offline exam is expected to be taken by approximately six lakh aspirants at test centres in 72 cities across India, the petitioners submitted.“Conducting the aforesaid examination across India at such perilous time is nothing else but putting lives of lakhs of young students (including Petitioners herein) at utmost risk and danger of disease and death,” submitted the petition filed by Vasireddy Govardhana Sai Prakash and 19 other civil services aspirants.A Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar on Thursday gave liberty to the petitioners to serve a copy of the petition on the UPSC counsel and posted the matter for further hearing on September 28."Liberty is granted to serve advance copy on the Standing Counsel for the Union Public Service Commission as well as on the Standing Counsel for the Central Agency representing Union of India through email/online," it said.The petitioners contended the UPSC's decision to conduct the exam in accordance with the revised calendar, violated their rights under Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution to practise their chosen profession/occupation of serving the public.Natural calamities such as flood, incessant rain and landslides were likely to directly affect the life and health of petitioners and many similarly situated students, they said seeking postponement of the exam by two-three months.Being a recruitment examination, Civil Services Exam was altogether different from an academic exam and in the event of its postponement, there would not be any question of delay or loss of any academic session, they submitted.“Hence, the impugned Revised Calendar is utterly arbitrary, unreasonable, whimsical and patently violative of the ‘Right to Health’ and ‘Right to Life’ of the Petitioners herein and lakhs of similarly situated students, under Article 21,” the petitioners contended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-sc-seeks-postponement-of-civil-services-exams-145894

24-09-2020||New Delhi||‘Fit India Movement’: PM Modi asks Kohli about Yo-Yo test, praises J&K woman footballer Afshan Ashiq||Skipper Virat Kohli explained how the Yo-Yo test helped Indian cricketers aim for high-level fitness when Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked him about the mandatory running aerobic fitness routine.Prime Minister Modi was interacting with fitness experts and influencers from across the country to mark the one-year anniversary of the ‘Fit India Movement.’              Modi was keen to know what is Yo-Yo test and asked if the captain also has to pass it or he gets spared?“I heard these days there is a Yo-Yo test for the team, what is this test,” asked Modi during the virtual interaction.Kohli, smiling, replied, “This Test was very important from fitness point of view. If we talk about global fitness level, our fitness level is still low compared to other teams and we want to take it up, which is a basic requirement.”            The gruelling routine has two sets of cones that are 20 metres apart. Once the beep is sounded, the athlete has to reach the marker on the other side by the time the next beep sounds, turn and get back to where he started before the third beep.The frequency of the beeps gradually increases for the subsequent runs.Kohli, who is currently in the UAE for the ongoing 13th IPL, said even he has to clear the test to get selected for the India team.“I’m the one who goes to run first and this is the condition that if I fail that I am also not available for selection. It is important to set that culture and it will lead to improvement in overall fitness levels.”     The session was attended by sports persons such as Paralympic javelin gold medallist Devendra Jhajharia and woman footballer from Jammu and Kashmir Afshan Ashiq.Also present were actor, model and runner Milind Soman and nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar.Modi also interacted with Afshan, who hit the headlines in 2017 as a stone pelter in Srinagar.The 25-year-old played as goalkeeper in J&K women’s football team and later played in the Indian Women’s League in 2019 for FC Kolhapur City. She also trains youngsters in Srinagar.To encourage her Modi said, “You have done very well in football. Mostly, football fans say ‘Bend it like Beckham’, but now they will say ‘Ace it like Afshan’.”           Afshan said she gets inspiration from former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, eulogised as ‘captain cool’.“I do meditation at 5:30 every morning to keep my mind cool. I have learnt a lot from M S Dhoni, he is always calm. I like getting that calmness in my life, it helps to do all work calmly. It helps in balancing mental stress.”              Kohli said better fitness has helped the players, especially fast bowlers, to perform during crucial moments.“In Test cricket, sometimes we get tired. Our fast bowlers are best in the world currently and if they have to put that effort on the fourth and fifth day on the field, they can do it now,” he said.“We always had the skills but when in the crucial moment when the body gets tired and the team needs you, our performance used to dip and our opponents used to win, now because of our fitness, we have been able to capitalise and perform on those crucial moments,” he added.Kohli said he didn’t follow the right diet early in his career and stressed on the need to bring an overall change in lifestyle.“When I started playing, I started having lot of things which were not good from health point of view. So physical fitness and diet had to change. Now life is very hectic, so if we don’t keep fitness in sync with our times, we will keep falling behind. If we wouldn’t have focussed on our fitness then we would have fallen behind in our sports as well. We can’t only depend on our skills as mental strength depends on how fit is the body and mind.”        Modi said he was glad that healthy eating is becoming a part of people’s way of living.“Becoming fit is not as difficult as most think. It just requires a little discipline. ‘Fitness ki dose, aadha ghanta roz’. Every Indian should play some game or do some fitness activity, be it tennis, badminton, kabaddi. It has to be for at least half an hour,” the PM said.

24-09-2020||Mumbai||Bombay High Court asks Raut to reply to Kangana's plea on bungalow demolition||The Bombay High Court on Thursday directed Shiv Sena chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut to file his reply to actor Kangana Ranaut's petition against the demolition of a part of her bungalow in Mumbai by the BMC.A bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and R I Chagla also directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's (BMC) H-ward officer Bhagyawant Late to file his reply to the plea.Late had signed the demolition notice served to Ranaut on September 7.On Tuesday, Ranaut's lawyer senior counsel Birendra Saraf submitted in the court a DVD containing a speech in which Raut allegedly made a comment threatening the actress.Following this, the HC bench had permitted Ranaut to make both Raut and Late parties to the case.On Thursday, the bench said it will begin final hearing in the case on Friday.Raut's counsel Pradeep Thorat asked for more time to file the reply, saying the Shiv Sena Rajya Sabha member is currently in New Delhi.BMC's senior counsel Anil Sakhre also sought more time for Late to file his reply.Justice Kathawalla said the bench will begin hearing the petitioner (Ranaut) on Friday and Raut could file his reply anytime before his turn to put forth his arguments in the court.The bench, however, directed the BMC to file the reply on Late's behalf by Monday, saying it could not delay the hearing."We cannot leave the demolished house the way it is.The building is demolished partly, and in the heavy monsoon, we cannot leave it in this state. We will start hearing the petitioner tomorrow," the bench said.Ranaut, in her plea filed in the HC on September 9, sought that the demolition carried out by the BMC at her Pali Hill bungalow be declared illegal.She subsequently amended her plea to demand Rs two crore as damages from the civic body and its officials.In her plea, she alleged that the BMC had demolished the bungalow out of personal vendetta since she had made some comments adverse to the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government.The BMC in its affidavit filed in the high court denied the allegation.In the affidavit filed through advocate Joel Carlos, the BMC said Ranaut had carried out illegal structural changes and repairs at the bungalow, and the civic officers were merely following the law in demolishing unauthorised portions of the structure.The civic body had urged the high court to dismiss Ranaut's plea and to impose a cost on her.

24-09-2020||Faridkot||PDS wheat ends up in open market; price falls 20 per cent||With a surge in wheat delivery through the Public Distribution System (PDS) among the Smart Ration Cardholders during the lockdown, the prices of wheat, flour, maida and suji have fallen by more than 20 per cent in September in the area.Wheat is trading currently at Rs 1,600 per quintal in the open market against Rs 2,200 per quintal in April this year. The current market price of wheat is more than 15 per cent lower than the minimum support price of Rs 1,925 a quintal, offered by food procurement agencies to farmers during the rabi season.Sources attributed this fall in price mainly to a large number of Smart Ration Card-holders selling the wheat they had received under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) and Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) during the past three months.Other than providing 30-kg wheat at a discounted price of Rs 2 per kg through the PDS, under the PMGKAY, every smart cardholder family member was distributed 15 kg wheat free this time.Under the AAY, every smart cardholder family was provided 5-kg wheat per member per month at Rs 2 per kg. This stock of six month makes 30 kg per member.With an average family of four or five members getting 200-225 kg of wheat this time, its major portion was sold in the open market at the price ranging between Rs 1,400-Rs 1,500 per quintal, said sources in the Food and Supply Department.Wheat was sold in the open market at throwaway prices by the cardholders as many of them were rendered jobless due to the lockdown, said a senior functionary in the department.Other than this increased supply of free and subsidized wheat under PMGKAY and AAY schemes, what further gave an impetus to flood the open market with wheat was a scheme of Punjab government under which 10 lakh packets of dry rations, containing 10 kg atta, 2 kg dal and 2 kg sugar each, was distributed to daily wagers and unorganized labourers to help them through the lockdown imposed in light of Covid-19 crisis.Punjab has about 34.62 lakh such ration cardholder families. In Faridkot district, the number of such cardholders is about 80,000 and over 3,00,000 persons have been listed as beneficiaries on these cards, revealed sources in food and supply department here.The huge flow of wheat stock in the open market has even dampened a move of Central Food Ministry of cutting the base price of wheat by nearly 12 per cent to clear the excess stock from the central pool. Food Corporation of India (FCI) is offering wheat at Rs 1,840 per 100 kg so that to increase the offtake given overflowing stock. But as the market prices are hovering much below Rs 1,840, so the FCI is not getting much of the desired number of buyers.Vineet Parkash, divisional manager, divisional office, FCI in Faridkot said despite the decline in the price, the FCI is also getting its share of buyers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pds-wheat-ends-up-in-open-market-price-falls-20-per-cent-145879
24-09-2020||New Delhi||Opposition ‘directionless', it boycotts Parliament and protests outside: Javadekar||The ruling BJP on Thursday termed the opposition's politics "directionless" as it took a dig at its rivals for complaining to President Ram Nath Kovind over the passage of some key bills while "abdicating" the right to speak in Parliament.Senior party leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar took a swipe at the opposition parties, saying they boycotted Parliament when "revolutionary" labour bills were being debated and did not follow the Chair's direction to return to their seats for the division of votes in Rajya Sabha during the passage of two farm bills."They (opposition) shamed Rajya Sabha," the Information and Broadcasting minister told reporters about the ruckus in the House on Sunday following which eight opposition members were suspended."The opposition's politics has become directionless. They had the right to sit in Parliament and express their views but they instead abdicated it and staged a walkout. They began protests and dharna outside and are now meeting the President," he said.There are nearly 300 days for these things, Javadekar said, adding that Parliament meets for 70-80 days so that its members could express their views there.The opposition boycotted Parliament and is now complaining everywhere, he said.The opposition parties have been up in arms against the passage of farm bills, and their delegation on Wednesday urged President Kovind not to give his assent to the same. They also called the passage of the bills "unconstitutional".Javadekar said farmers have received a "boon" in the form of these proposed laws and asserted that the opposition's allegations about the minimum support price (MSP) and agriculture 'mandis' have been proved "wrong".The government has just hiked MSPs of rabi crops and will now procure them, he said.The new labour laws will give "salary, social and health" rights to farmers and ensure equal wages for women for the first time since independence, the minister said, adding that the opposition is now complaining after not taking part in the debate on the same."This is wrong," he added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-directionless-it-boycotts-parliament-and-protests-outside-javadekar-145876

24-09-2020||New Delhi||Daily Covid recoveries surpass new cases for past 6 days||Nearly 74 per cent of the new COVID-19 recoveries are from 10 states and UT, including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, UP, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Delhi, Kerala, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh, the Union Health Ministry said on Thursday.Daily new recoveries in India have surpassed the new cases of coronavirus infection for the past six days and the country’s total COVID-19 recoveries have surged to 46.7 lakh exceeding active cases by more than 37 lakh.A total of 87,374 people have recuperated in a span of 24 hours in the country while the number of new confirmed cases reported is 86,508, according to the data updated at 8 am.With its focussed strategies and effective people-centric measures, India is reporting an exponential increase in recoveries, the ministry said.Also read: National Covid cases breach 57-lakh mark; recovery rate stands at 81.5 per cent75 pc of COVID-19 cases reported in 24 hours concentrated in 10 states/UTs: Health Ministry“New recoveries in India have exceeded the new cases for the last six days. This is a result of the focus on testing, tracing, treatment, surveillance and clear messaging, as highlighted by the prime minister in his review meeting with seven high focus states and UTs on Wednesday,” the ministry said.A total 87,374 people have recuperated in a span of 24 hours taking the total number of recoveries to 46,74,987 pushing the recovery rate to 81.55 per cent, the ministry said.“As India records more recoveries than the new cases, the gap between recovered cases and active cases is continuously widening. The recovered cases (46,74,987) exceed active cases (9,66,382) by more than 37 lakh. This has also ensured that the active caseload accounts for merely 16.86 per cent of the total cases,” the Ministry highlighted.Following the national lead, 13 states and UTs are also reporting a higher number of new recoveries than the new cases.Among the 10 states and UT reporting 74 per cent recovered cases, Maharashtra has maintained this lead with 19,476 cases (22.3 pc) for the sixth consecutive day.These sustained encouraging results had been made possible with the Centre-led proactive and calibrated strategy of ‘test, track and treat’ which had focussed on ‘Chase the Virus’ approach, the Ministry said.“Early identification through high and aggressive testing, prompt surveillance and tracking combined with high-quality medical care through Standard of Care protocol issued by the Centre has aided the high number of recoveries,” it underlined.There has been sustained focus of the Union and state and UT governments on improved and effective clinical treatment in hospitals, supervised home isolation, use of non-invasive oxygen support, use of steroids, anti-coagulants, and improved services of ambulances for ferrying patients for prompt and timely treatment.Tireless efforts of ASHA workers have ensured effective surveillance and tracking progress of patients in supervised home isolation.The ‘eSanjeevani’ digital platform has enabled telemedicine services which have been successful in containing the spread of COVID while simultaneously enabling provisions for non-COVID essential healthcare.The Centre has focussed on building the clinical management capacities of doctors manning ICUs. The ‘National e-ICU on COVID-19 Management’ exercise conducted by domain experts from AIIMS, New Delhi, has substantially helped in this. Twenty such sessions with 278 Institutions and Centres of Excellence have been conducted in 28 states and UTs.India’s COVID-19 caseload mounted to 57,32,518 with 86,508 people testing positive in a day, while the death toll climbed to 91,149 with 1,129 people succumbing to the disease in a span of 24 hours, the data updated at 8 am showed.

24-09-2020||Aditi Tandon||APMC Act abolition didn’t work in Bihar: Jairam||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 24A day after the Parliament passed the controversial agricultural reform bills and the opposition urged the President to return the Bills for passage through proper procedure, the Congress on Thursday argues that the abolition of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act in Bihar in 2006, acclaimed as an important measure to free agricultural markets, did not really work.In a tweet, Congress leader and party chief whip in Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh said the abolition of the law did not break up local trader monopolies, reduce the control of intermediaries, or improve market access and alternatives for farmers.“A 2019 study by National Council of Applied Economic Research(NCAER) finds that despite the repeal of the APMC Act, private investment in the creation of new markets and strengthening of facilities in the existing ones did not take place in Bihar, leading to low market density. Further, the participation of government agencies in procurement and the scale of procurement of grains continue to be low. Thus, farmers are left to the mercy of traders who unscrupulously fix lower prices for agricultural produce that they buy from farmers,” Ramesh quoted from the study as battle lines get drawn in election-bound Bihar.Ramesh further cited the study that says inadequate market facilities and institutional arrangements are responsible for low price realisation and instability in prices.“The abolition of the APMC Act in Bihar in 2006 has led to a deterioration in public infrastructure; not changed the situation for small and marginal farmers who continue to sell to small village-level intermediaries; left a regulatory vacuum in the state and poor public procurement; increased number of intermediaries in some commodity markets to deal with increased risk and not attracted large-scale private sector investment,” the Congress leader and former minister said, on the eve of Bharat Bandh 250 farmer organisations have called against the passage of farm bills.The Congress said the Bihar experience of abolishing the APMC Act shows that, “it is easier to dismantle institutions than build them. The consequences could be very serious for the farm sector and the farming community.”Quoting past research on the outcomes of APMC Act abolition, Ramesh cited broad categories as warning signs should the recently passed farm bills become laws after Presidential assent — Deterioration in public infrastructure; Small and marginal farmers have not benefitted; Regulatory vacuum and poor public procurement and increase in intermediaries in some commodity markets.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/apmc-act-abolition-didnt-work-in-bihar-jairam-145868
24-09-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus-infected Deputy CM Manish Sisodia diagnosed with dengue, moved to Max Hospital||Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, admitted to hospital due to the coronavirus infection, was also diagnosed with dengue on Thursday and his condition took a turn for the worse, sources said.Sisodia was moved to the private Max Hospital in Saket from the Delhi government-run LNJP Hospital in the evening, considering his "falling" blood platelet count and low oxygen level, they said.He was admitted to Max Hospital ICU.They said the deputy CM's platelet count was around one lakh in the evening as against the normal rage of 1.5-4.5 lakh per microliter of blood.Sisodia is perhaps the first prominent personality in Delhi to have contracted a "double infection" of the novel coronavirus and dengue.He is the second minister in the Arvind Kejriwal government to contract COVID-19 infection after Health Minister Satyendar Jain.The health minister had tested positive for COVID-19 in June and was hospitalised. He was later administered plasma therapy.The deputy chief minister, who had tested positive for COVID-19 on September 14, was admitted to the LNJP Hospital on Wednesday after he complained of fever and low oxygen level.Earlier, an official said that the minister had been put on oxygen support as per requirement and had been under constant observation at the LNJP Hospital, which is a dedicated COVID-19 facility.Sources at LNJP Hospital earlier said, "There is no standard protocol for treatment of double infection of COVID-19 and dengue, and treatment is "patient-specific".Earlier in the day, a doctor said, "The deputy CM will be administered an RT-PCR test in a couple of days." Another source said that the minister's age, condition, co-morbidities and other factors will be taken into account for treatment of both the ailments, adding that right now, his condition is being assessed," a source said.Asked if there are any side effects of treatments in cases of a "double infection", the source, said, "any treatment can have a side effect, but the treating doctor decides the methodology for it".A dengue patient, if his or her platelet level falls dangerously below the normal level, needs external platelet infusion.Asked if the 48-year-old Aam Aadmi Party leader has any co-morbidities, a doctor, also a senior official said, "He has hypertension".Earlier in the day, in a video message, Sisodia praised the efforts made by doctors at the LNJP hospital."I have been brought to the LNJP Hospital after a need was felt for it. But, seeing the spirit with which the doctors and other healthcare workers are serving patients, I must say, as a deputy chief minister, it is very encouraging," he said."It is a wonderful facility here and I am very proud of them. If you need any medical attention in this coronavirus time, LNJP is ready to serve you," the minister said.Sisodia was unable to attend the one-day Delhi Assembly session on September 14 since he had tested positive for the disease.

Some also posted videos of the explosions and the fire on social media."The fire broke out in the inlet gas terminal after three massive blasts at 3.05 am. The compressed gas was depressurised to bring the fire under control," Surat District Collector Dhaval Patel said.Fire vehicles of the ONGC, Surat Municipal Corporation and local industrial units rushed to the spot and brought the blaze under control, he said.The inlet gas terminal where the fire broke out was cordoned off and the plant secured, he said, adding the cause of the fire will be ascertained after cooling operations are completed.No other industry in the area was affected, he said.There was no confirmation from the district administration of reports that the fire was apparently caused by a rupture in the 36-inch Uran-Mumbai gas pipeline.The ONGC in a tweet said, "A fire was observed in the Hazira Gas processing plant in the morning today. Fire has been brought under control. There is no casualty or injury to any person."Fire has been brought under control.

A trunking system is a two-way radio communication."Proposals for up-gradation of these sets were initiated 10 years ago but even tenders have not been finalised yet. The number of wireless sets under the conventional system declined from 9,638 in June 2009 to 6,172 in June 2019 as the sets condemned during the period were not regularly replaced," the report said.The CAG report also pointed out "the functioning of the Delhi police being affected by shortages in manpower"."MHA had approved 12,518 posts with advice to operationalise 3,139 posts first and then remaining 9,379 posts after deployment of 3,139 personnel on ground. However, due to failure of Delhi Police to recruit against these 3,139 posts, the remaining 9,379 approved posts could not be operationalised (August 2020)," it said.The report further stated that representation of women in Delhi Police was 11.75 per cent, which was much lower than the desired target of 33 per cent.The housing satisfaction was also quite low as there were only 15,360 quarters available for about 80,000 Delhi Police personnel.The report said only one out of the 72 police stations test-checked in the audit had staff as per the norms prescribed by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D)."In these 72 police stations, we found, there was 35 per cent shortage of manpower. Acute shortage of staff has put the police personnel under tremendous strain as their average daily duty hours in the six test-checked police districts (Central, New Delhi, South, Dwarka, North East and Rohini) ranged from 12 to 15 hours against eight hours as prescribed under the Model Police Act 2006," it said.

24-09-2020||Pune||Work from home hurting back and neck; people seek medical help||With work from home becoming the new normal amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have started complaining of neck pain and backache while working for long hours and are seeking help from physiotherapists.Health experts say this is due to improper sitting postures and people need to follow good ergonomics and working habits at home.Employees of several corporate firms and industrial bodies have been working from home for nearly six months now since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the country.“Initially, work from home system brought cheers among employees. But due to long working hours and improper sitting postures, many have started complaining of neck pain, backache and other issues,” Dr Apurv Shimpi, head of the community physiotherapy department in Pune's Sancheti Hospital told PTI.He said the National Institute of Personnel Management’s (NIPM) Pune Chapter, a body of HR professionals here in Maharashtra, approached the hospital to conduct physiotherapy sessions for their associate members.“Over 700 people took part in the recent session where they were given tips on work from home ergonomics,” he said.“Our physiotherapists explained about the wrong postures and positions adopted by employees while working from home. We gave them tips like raising the height of laptop screen to eye-level, use of pillows, taking frequent breaks and doing exercises for relaxing the mind and eyes,” he added.NIPM Pune Chapter’s Chairman Dr (Capt) C M Chitale said many professionals had been complaining of the spinal cord-related issues.“During the webinar, physiotherapists gave participants several ergonomic tips and explained the ideal work postures to avoid backache and other health-related issues,” he said.Narendra Patil, HR head of Pune-based Kalyani Maxion Wheels Pvt Ltd, said though their firm was into manufacturing, several employees were currently working from home and had been complaining of backache and neck pain.“We asked our employees to take part in the physiotherapy session organised by NIPM and it turned out to be beneficial for them,” he said.Anita Perla, senior manager (human resource) at KSH Distriparks here, said she attended a webinar on physiotherapy arranged by the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture.“Working from home is very different from working in an office. Infrastructure in the office is set up to support working conditions but it is not possible in a work from home set up. Hence, such sessions are important,” she said.Dr Sourabh Sane, a physiotherapist with city-based fitness start-up HealYos, said they were teaching people how to set up a proper work station at home.“We guide them on what should be the ideal height of the laptop and their work screen. The table-chair arrangement should be such that the computer screen should be at the eye- level,” he said.“Keeping a hard pillow on the chair for back support and simple stretching exercises also help people who have a sedentary working style for long hours,” he added.

24-09-2020||United Nations||UN report takes note of policies, initiatives in India to combat child, forced marriages||A report of the UN Secretary General on child and forced marriages has taken note of national policies and capacity-building initiatives taken in India to promote gender and child-sensitive health services, including for girls subjected to such alliances, and "promising experiences" about supporting those affected by the practices.The Report of Secretary General Antonio Guterres on ‘Issue of child, early and forced marriage’, which covers the period from June 2018 to May 2020, said several states adopted legislative and policy measures to raise the minimum age of marriage and also put in place comprehensive strategies to combat child, early and forced marriage.The report contains an overview of progress made towards ending child, early and forced marriages worldwide.“For example, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Mozambique, the Niger and Uganda developed national policies and guidelines and undertook capacity-building initiatives to promote more gender- and child-sensitive health and protection services, including for girls subjected to child, early and forced marriage,” the report said.The report also includes promising experiences with programmes aimed at ending those practices and supporting already married girls and women affected by the practices.It added that in India, adolescents are involved in the ‘Ladli Samman’ campaign, which consists of the mapping of social and economic vulnerabilities and linking them to social protection schemes and counselling support.The report noted that the empowerment of girls at risk and that of already married women and girls can also be promoted by ensuring their access to economic assets and by strengthening their financial independence and their livelihood and entrepreneurship skills.“Families suffering from financial instability are more likely to regard daughters as an economic burden, in particular when unable to finance a daughter's education, and consequently justify their early marriage,” the report said.In India, the UNFPA-UNICEF Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage supported the Kanyashree Prakalpa programme of West Bengal through conditional cash transfers to encourage their continued education and prevent child marriage.The report said countries and other stakeholders have also undertaken efforts towards addressing the specific needs of girls and women affected by child, early and forced marriage.In India, the Institute of Health Management contributed to empowering several dozens of married girls. They had the opportunity to obtain access to health, educational, economic and legal support.Another programme reported by UNICEF refers to more than 1,500 adolescent girls trained as digital champions (sathis) who had produced 103 short videos covering positive stories of resistance to, or avoidance of, child marriage.According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), in the past decade, 25 million child marriages have been prevented globally thanks to the increased rate of girls' education, the proactive investment of governments in adolescent girls and the raising of the public's awareness of the harms and illegality of child marriage.However, globally, the total number of married girls is estimated to be 12 million per year. The prevalence rate of child, early and forced marriage remain high, in particular in some regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which represent 18 per cent and 44 per cent, respectively, of the global burden.A marked reduction in the prevalence rate was recorded in South Asia, however, the prevalence in Latin America and the Caribbean has remained stagnant for 25 years. No region is on track to eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 2030, as set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the lives of children and families across the globe, negatively affecting efforts towards ending child, early and forced marriage and unions. Reports are emerging from Africa and Asia in particular of an increase in the number of early or child marriages, the report said.

Till date, the vendor has not confirmed the transfer of this technology,” CAG said. “Offset obligation” is the stipulated share of work that the foreign manufacturer is obligated to get done in India.The CAG report, Management of Defence Offsets, said it was found in many cases that foreign vendors made offset commitments to qualify for the main supply contract, but were later not earnest about fulfilling these commitments.

Turkey should learn to respect the sovereignty of other nations and reflect on its own policies more deeplyIndia’s Permanent Representative in the UN TS Tirumurti hit back by describing his remarks as “gross interference in India’s internal affairs” and said they were “completely unacceptable”.Turkey, he said, should learn to respect the sovereignty of other nations and reflect on its own policies more deeply. Turkey under Erdogan has been engaged in a brutal crackdown on the minority Kurds, denies the Armenian genocide and recently converted a museum into a mosque, drawing approbation from around the world.Erdogan had even hinted at a plebiscite which is a red rag to India by observing that “we are in favour of solving this issue through dialogue within the framework of UN resolutions, especially in line with the expectations of the people of Kashmir”.However, the relevant UNSC resolution asks Pakistan to first remove its troops and personnel from the region. Erdogan rubbed a few more countries the wrong way in his speech and in case of Armenia and Azerbaijan, even named them.
