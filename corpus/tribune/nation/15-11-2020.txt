It is named after Ramsar, the Iranian city where the treaty was signed in 1971, and places chosen for conservation under it are given the tag ‘Ramsar site’.“Happy to note that India has added two more Ramsar sites. Lonar lake in Maharashtra, the only crater lake of country, and Sur Sarovar, also known as Keetham lake, in Agra. “Wetlands are the world’s natural water filters and one of the most productive ecosystem on the planet,” Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar tweeted on Sunday.Recently, Kabartal in Bihar’s Begusarai district was recognised as a wetland of international importance, the first such wetland in the state, under the Ramsar Convention, according to the Union Environment Ministry.The Asan Conservation Reserve in Dehradun, the first wetland from Uttarakhand to be recognised by Ramsar convention, was added to the list in October this year.The other 38 Ramsar sites in India include Chilika Lake in Odisha, Keoladeo National Park in Rajasthan, Harike Lake in Punjab, Loktak Lake in Manipur and Wular Lake in Jammu and Kashmir.The convention, signed in 1971 in the Iranian city of Ramsar, is one of the oldest inter-governmental accord for preserving the ecological character of wetlands. Also known as the Convention on Wetlands, it aims to develop a global network of wetlands for conservation of biological diversity and for sustaining human life.Wetlands provide a wide range of important resources and ecosystem services such as food, water, fibre, groundwater recharge, water purification, flood moderation, erosion control and climate regulation.Over 170 countries are party to the Ramsar Convention and over 2,000 designated sites covering over 20 crore hectares have been recognised under it.In January this year, 10 wetlands in India were recognised by the Ramsar Convention as sites of international importance. These are Nandur Madhameshwar in Maharashtra, Keshopur-Miani, Beas Conservation Reserve and Nangal in Punjab, and Nawabganj, Parvati Agra, Saman, Samaspur, Sandi and SarsaiNawar in Uttar Pradesh.The other Ramsar sites are in Rajasthan, Kerala, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal, Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-more-wetlands-in-india-added-to-list-of-recognised-sites-under-ramsar-convention-170767

15-11-2020||New Delhi||India dismisses Pakistan charge on terrorism as figment of imagination: MEA||India on Sunday mounted a hard-hitting attack on Pakistan for accusing it of involvement in some of the terror strikes in that country and said the so-called claims of ‘proof’ are figments of imagination.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said Pakistan’s “desperate attempt” will find few takers as the international community is aware of its tactics, and proof of Islamabad’s terror sponsorship has been admitted by none other than its “own leadership”.The angry reaction by India came a day after Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi addressed a press conference alongside Army spokesman Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar to claim that India was behind some of the terror attacks in that country.“This is yet another futile anti-India propaganda exercise. The so-called claims of ‘proof’ against India enjoy no credibility, are fabricated and represent figments of imagination,” Srivastava said in response to media queries on the allegations.He described the press conference as a deliberate attempt on the part of the Pakistani establishment to shift focus from its internal political and economic failures and to justify cross-border terrorism, including ceasefire violations and infiltration at the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.“The face of global terror, Osama Bin Laden, was found in Pakistan, Pakistan’s PM glorified him as a ‘martyr’ from the floor of Parliament, he admitted the presence of 40,000 terrorists in Pakistan.“Their science and technology minister proudly claimed involvement and success of Pakistan, led by its prime minister, in the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 Indian soldiers were martyred,” Srivastava said.Distant parts of the world have seen terror trail lead back to Pakistan, he said, adding concocting documents and peddling false narratives will not absolve Pakistan of such actions.“We are confident the world will hold it to account,” he said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-dismisses-pakistan-charge-on-terrorism-as-figment-of-imagination-mea-170762

Since then, all of them have spoken on the phone with Biden though Donald Trump refuses to concede the election and has mounted a legal challenge.Close US allies Tokyo, Canberra and Seoul were also in the first batch to congratulate Biden but Russia and Turkey remained silent and China sent a delayed and low-key message.While Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga, Australian PM Scott Morrison and South Korean President Moon Jae-in have received phone calls from Biden about five-six days after their congratulatory messages, the MEA here said a Modi-Biden phone conversation would take place in “due course at a mutually convenient time”.The Kremlin has so far not congratulated Biden saying “it is right to wait for the official results to be announced.’’ Beijing was slow in calling and when it came two days back, the greetings were from the Chinese Foreign Office. Like Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping has stayed silent whereas President Ram Nath Kovind joined PM Modi in welcoming Biden to the White House.Brazil and Turkey are the other major countries that have held out. Turkey has taken a position similar to that of Russia—waiting for the settlement of legal challenges before congratulating the winner.PM Modi had even interjected a sub-continental note by telling Harris that her success is a matter of immense pride not just for “your chittis (aunts in Tamil), but also for all Indian-Americans.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-waits-for-biden-phone-call-170737
15-11-2020||New Delhi||Upcoming G20 summit will be a milestone: Saudi Arabia||The upcoming summit of the G20 will be a “milestone”, Saudi Arabia, the chair of the powerful economic bloc, said on Sunday amid mounting expectations of fiscal support, debt reductions and several other monetary measures by the grouping to help the global economy recover from the coronavirus-driven collapse.Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to India Saud bin Mohammed Al Sati said the virtual summit on November 21-22 will largely focus on addressing the implications of the coronavirus pandemic, future health care plans and steps for reviving the global economy.Al Sati said Saudi Arabia values the knowledge and experience that India has brought to the G20 as well as its remarkable efforts in extending medical supplies to several countries across the globe to deal with the pandemic.The envoy said Saudi Arabia has already engaged with a host of stakeholders including businesses and think tanks across the globe to come up with strong policy solutions for the G20 member nations and beyond to deal with the massive socio-economic disruptions caused by the pandemic.The G20 comprises the world’s largest and fastest-growing economies and accounts for 85 percent of the global GDP and two-thirds of its population.The summit of the powerful grouping is taking place in the midst of the worst global downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Following a virtual summit in March, the G20 had announced to inject over USD 5 trillion into the global economy to offset the impact of the pandemic.“The upcoming meeting on November 21-22 is going to be a milestone. Members of the G20 are going to be meeting virtually for the second time, during this year.“Coupled with key ministerial meetings and leaders’ summits, G20 has attached great attention to the work of the eight engagement groups, as they constituted the core of the efforts of the G20 for this year, with the aim of building a more resilient and better world for all,” Al Sati said.“Among other major agenda points, the summit will work towards addressing the implications of the pandemic, future health care plans and steps to be taken to revive the global economy,” he said.There have been expectations of major announcements as well as an unveiling of a framework for debt reductions for the poor countries by the G20 summit which will be participated by US President Donald Trump, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga, Rusian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and German Chancellor Angela Merkel among others.The envoy said the Saudi presidency will build on the success of the G20 leaders’ summit in March and on the outcomes of over 100 virtual working groups and ministerial meetings.   “The focus remains on protecting lives and restoring growth, by addressing vulnerabilities brought to light during the pandemic and by laying down stronger foundations for a better future,” he said.Saudi Arabia assumed the G20 Presidency on December 1, 2019 with an ambitious theme, namely ‘realising opportunities of the 21st century for all’.The three pillars of the theme include: empowering people, safeguarding the planet and shaping new frontiers.Al Sati said consensus building and effective and harmonised responses are going to be at the heart of all “landmark outcomes” of the G20 this year.“It is with these priorities that we are drawing a roadmap of resilience and inclusive progress, knowledge sharing and consensus building, economic resurgence and preparedness,” he said.Al Sati also quoted Saudi Arabia’s Investment Minister Khalid Al-Falih to say that the country’s presidency has contributed about USD 11 trillion to protect the global economy with a clear commitment and determination to do “whatever is necessary” to overcome the coronavirus pandemic.“The decisions like suspending debt service payments for the world’s poorest countries that would allow beneficiary countries to defer USD 14 billion in debt payments due and use these amounts instead for financing their health systems and social programmes are very crucial. This has benefitted around 43 countries till date,” the envoy said.He also mentioned G20 allocating USD 21 billion toward diagnostic and treatment tools, medicines and vaccines to combat the coronavirus.“The G20 has stressed that equitable and affordable access to vaccines for all is the key to overcoming the novel coronavirus pandemic and supporting global economic recovery.“We acknowledge India’s role as a major producer of vaccines and we appreciate the crucial role it plays in the efforts to make vaccines available and accessible,” Al Sati said.“We acknowledge India’s remarkable efforts during the coronavirus pandemic to help several countries across the globe battle with the pandemic,” he said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/upcoming-g20-summit-will-be-a-milestone-saudi-arabia-170735

Intensive interrogation is on and efforts are being made to know truth from the detained persons,” said Deputy IG (Kanpur) Dr Preetinder Singh.Several police teams have been formed to make sure early arrest of the culprits, he added.Forensic experts, with the help of sniffer dogs, have been deployed to gather scientific evidence at Ghatampur’s Bhadras village. The body has been sent for a post-mortem. The DIG said farmer Karan Sankhwar’s six-year-old daughter Shreya had gone missing on Saturday evening while his family was preparing for Diwali prayers.The family could not locate her. They kept looking for her with flashlights towards the jungles but failed to trace her, the DIG added.On Sunday morning, the body was found by some villagers passing from there, DIG said.The injury marks on the upper parts of the body suggested that she was killed with a sharp-edged weapon, said another senior official. The girl’s belongings, including slippers and clothes, were also found lying near a tree.

15-11-2020||New Delhi||As its fate hangs in balance, LJP claims it proved its worth in Bihar||With questions being raised about the Lok Janshakti Party’s prospects after it won only one seat in the Bihar Assembly polls, party sources on Sunday cited its “influence” in “changing” results in over 40 seats to assert it will continue to have a key presence in the state politics.The LJP was instrumental in the defeat of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led JD(U)in at least 36 seats which is evident from its vote share, and the BJP would also have been hit hard if the regional party had gone all out against it in a similar manner, the sources claimed.The LJP might have won only one seat, but it has underscored its presence by fetching 5.7 percent votes, the party sources said.They noted that the party put up candidates in only six seats where the BJP was in the fray while contesting on almost each of the 115 seats where the JD(U) contested in the elections to the 243-seat Bihar Assembly polls.With the JD(U), hit hard by the LJP in the elections, likely to oppose any friendly vibes to the party by its ally BJP, the sources in the Chirag Paswan-led party claimed that it was offered only 15 seats to contest in the polls, leaving it with no option other than to fight on its own.So far, there has been no official word from either the BJP or the LJP about the number of seats it was offered.LJP sources said their party could not have accepted only 15 seats after having six Lok Sabha MPs and one Rajya Sabha member in Ram Vilas Paswan, whose death has necessitated a byelection to the seat.“We had the option of either crossing over to the opposition or fighting on our own with a focus on seats being contested by the JD(U) as its reluctance was the main reason the LJP was offered only so few seats,” an LJP leader said, adding that its decision was driven by the desire to cause minimal harm to the BJP.The NDA scraped through in a close contest with the RJD-Left-Congress alliance by winning 125 seats against the opposition’s 110.The JD(U) suffered heavy losses as its tally fell to 43 from 71 in the 2015 polls. The LJP, which had two seats in the outgoing assembly, won only one seat while the BJP emerged victorious in 74.Chirag Paswan has insisted that his party might have left the NDA in Bihar, but it remains a member of the ruling alliance at the Centre.It remains to be seen what shape the LJP’s relations with the BJP at the Centre take as the party’s political presence is confined to Bihar where JD(U) leaders have expressed their opposition to any ties with Chirag Paswan’s party.In his campaign, Paswan was strongly critical of Nitish Kumar and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

15-11-2020||New Delhi||Delay in finalising seat sharing hurt ‘Mahagathbandhan’ in Bihar: Tariq Anwar||Delay in finalising seat sharing for the Bihar election adversely impacted the Mahagathbandhan’s poll performance, senior Congress leader Tariq Anwar said on Sunday, asserting that the Congress must learn from it and complete alliance formalities well in advance for upcoming assembly polls.Anwar, party’s general secretary and a veteran leader from Bihar, acknowledged that there were shortcomings due to which the party performed worse than other ‘Mahagathbandhan’ constituents and asserted that the high command was serious about an introspection as well as a thorough analysis of the results.In an interview with PTI, Anwar said the Bihar poll results were “definitely below” the Congress’ expectations and it was a setback to bag only 19 out of the 70 seats it contested.“There was an environment of change with enthusiasm among the common people for it, but we could not exploit that. We had the expectation that with the Congress fighting on 70 seats, it would win at least 50 per cent of the seats,” the former Union minister said.“Our government was not formed and we (the Congress) also have a responsibility in that. Going forward, our efforts will be aimed at strengthening the Congress and the Mahagathbandhan and we will make a strategy for it,” he said.His remarks assume significance as several poll analysts have stated that the Congress dragged the Mahagathbandhan down as it fell short of the majority mark, with the NDA under Nitish Kumar’s leadership emerging victorious in the polls by a narrow margin.Anwar, who was a member of the party’s poll management committee, said there should be an introspection and “we have also demanded that it should happen”.He said the high command was ready for an introspection and stressed the top leadership had given all possible support during the polls with former party chief Rahul Gandhi also holding many public meetings in the state.“But there have been shortcomings on our part otherwise we should have won 35-40 seats. So whether there were shortcomings in organisation or campaign, all of that will be discussed and analysed and it will be ascertained why the Congress’ performance was not at par with other Mahagathbandhan partners,” he said.Anwar said the reasons for the below par showing cannot be ascertained immediately, but what was important was to identify the mistakes committed and ensure they are not repeated in the Assembly polls in four states and one Union Territory in the coming months.“We want that discussions be held with those involved in this election, our candidates and District Congress Committees in Bihar and only then we can reach a conclusion,” the 69-year-old leader, who has won Lok Sabha polls multiple times from Bihar’s Katihar, said.The high command is definitely concerned over the Bihar results, he said.Asked if delay in firming up the Mahagathbandhan alliance and the seat sharing arrangement hurt the poll performance of the Opposition coalition, Anwar said, “Yes, I remember that Rahul ji had said in July itself that we should finish the process of firming up of the alliance and other formalities.”“Whatever the reason, that did not happen and you are right there was a lot of delay in finalising the alliance and it was sealed when the election was very near,” he said.If the formalities had been completed earlier, then maybe the Mahagathbandhan would have gotten the advantage in the election campaign, Anwar said.Alliance contradictions need some time to be ironed out and we did not get that time, he said.On rumblings in the Congress over ticket distribution, Anwar said the party is assessing what shortcomings were there.The high command is ready for introspection, but there are Diwali and Chhat festivals, after which senior observers of the party may be sent to the state for a thorough analysis.He said the Congress needs to learn quickly from its mistakes as elections are due in West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry next year for which the party should be battle-ready.“We should be ready beforehand and I agree that if we have to go for alliances then the formalities of those alliances should be completed as soon as possible,” he said.On All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen denting the Mahagathbandhan, Anwar said if any political party wants to contest “we cannot stop them”, but there is a “common understanding” that AIMIM’s role is in a way to help the BJP.“If we would have moved to protect our standing in Seemanchal and carried out our party’s activities early, then AIMIM would not have succeeded there. With the coming of AIMIM certainly the secular parties have been hit and if we look at it they have won five seats but would have damaged the Mahagathbandhan on 15 seats,” Anwar said.Asked if lack of clarity over party presidency was hurting Congress, he said the party’s poll panel under Madhusudan Mistry has already started the process for getting a full-time president.Due to coronavirus pandemic, an AICC session could not be called, but once the situation stabilises the process will be completed next year, he said.Anwar also hailed Rahul Gandhi for setting an example for other leaders by stepping down after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls defeat.“There is no dispute on Rahul Gandhi (for the choice for presidency), question is whether he wants to take it up,” he said.RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav-led Mahagathbandhan won 110 seats, 12 less than the magic figure of 122 in the 243-member Bihar Assembly. The NDA won 125 seats. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delay-in-finalising-seat-sharing-hurt-mahagathbandhan-in-bihar-tariq-anwar-170717

But an ASEAN statement a couple of months back had turned down India’s suggestion to start talks right away. Speaking at the summit being held in virtual mode, Jaishankar expressed concern about actions and incidents in the South China Sea that erode trust in the region. He also said the Code of Conduct negotiations on the South China Sea should not be prejudicial to legitimate interests of third parties and should be fully consistent with UNCLOS.Jaishankar also underlined the need for greater international cooperation in the post-Covid world to tackle the challenges cutting across national boundaries such as terrorism, climate change and pandemic, stated a Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) release. Read also: Asia forms world’s biggest trade bloc, a China-backed group excluding USThe East Asia summit consists of 10 ASEAN nations plus eight countries in three rungs – China, Japan and South Korea; India, New Zealand and Australia; and, the US and Russia. The Regional Economic Cooperation Partnership (RCEP) was signed on Sunday by all the regional players minus India. The US and Russia were not invited.The pact will create Asia’s largest free trade zone and will be Japan’s first FTA framework with China. Other countries will be barred from joining RCEP for some time but India will be allowed to participate whenever it chooses to do so.Like Jaishankar, US officials reaffirmed their support for a free and open Indo-Pacific while they underlined their latest Indo-Japan economic initiative with five ASEAN members in India’s periphery—Cambodia, Lao, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. Japanese PM Suga also stressed on the partnership with these five countries on the lower banks of the Mekong River.The summit was chaired by the Vietnamese PM Nguyen Xuan Phuc in his capacity as ASEAN Chair.The Summit discussed ways to strengthen the EAS platform and to make it more responsive to emerging challenges. Issues such as the South China Sea, situation in Korean peninsula and Rakhine state were discussed. Besides the Ha Noi Declaration, the Summit also adopted four other Leaders’ Statements on Marine Sustainability; Epidemics Prevention and Response; Women, Peace and Security; and Steady Growth of Regional Economy, stated the MEA release.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-warns-asean-of-security-perils-as-it-signs-fta-with-china-170710

15-11-2020||New Delhi||Nearly 160 tonnes of biomedical waste generated during Bihar polls||Nearly 160 tonnes of biomedical waste in the form of gloves, face masks and empty sanitiser bottles used by polling personnel and voters was generated during the Bihar assembly polls held amid the COVID-19 pandemic, poll authorities in the state have said.The poll authorities also relied on an inexpensive but effective technology used to track EVMs to ensure that the waste reached public health centres for its onward journey to the incinerator.To ensure the safety of voters, polling staff and security personnel in the first-ever polls held amid the pandemic, the Election Commission had procured 18 lakh face shields, 70 lakh face masks, 5.4 lakh single-use rubber gloves for polling and security personnel and 7.21 crore ‘one hand’ single-use polythene gloves for voters to press the EVM button and sign the register at the polling stations.It had also bought a total of 29 lakh hand sanitiser bottles of 100 and 500 ml.As per the guidelines issued by the Election Commission and poll authorities in Bihar, the polling stations were sanitised a day before the election and three times on the day of the election.The office of the Chief Electoral Officer of Bihar had sought the help of the state health department to decide on “COVID safety material” for the three-phase elections.The safety material which included face masks, face shields, gloves and personal sanitiser bottles were put in a bag meant for a polling party of six persons.“They were trained for the disposal of the safety material also. It could be littered anywhere,” Bihar Chief Electoral Officer H R Srinivas told PTI.He said roughly 160 tonnes of biomedical waste was generated.All districts have its biomedical waste (BMW) disposal agency. “The challenge was the agency would lift BMW from health centres, hospitals but not lift from polling stations. The districts then appointed BMW workers,” Srinivas said.On polling day, the workers would place two yellow-coloured dustbins per polling station for disposal of used masks, gloves and sanitiser bottles.A team with a vehicle and BMW workers was tagged with 10 to 15 polling stations.After the polling was concluded, the team would pick up the dustbins from the polling stations and bring it to the public health centre it was tagged to.From the PHC, the waste was taken for incineration in polythene bags.Responding to a question on how the vehicles with biomedical waste was tracked given the health hazard involved, Srinivas said at such a notice it was not possible to get each vehicle fitted with a GPS device. It is extremely costly and is of little use after the elections, he said.Electronic voting machines have to be tracked when they are transported.For that purpose, poll authorities use “Election Tracking Enabled System” or Ele-Traces, an application developed by NIC.“There is zero expenditure involved. It is a beautiful app... Two people (per vehicle) were asked to download the app and they were tracked,” the Bihar CEO explained.

15-11-2020||Kolkata/Mumbai||He will live forever through his cinema: Friends, politicians and industry colleagues remember Soumitra Chatterjee||A great cultural icon, a loyal friend and a cerebral personality with varied interests is how is politicians, colleagues and fans of his cinema remembered legendary actor Soumitra Chatterjee, who died in a Kolkata hospital on Sunday after a long battle with multiple ailments. He was 85.Chatterjee was admitted to the hospital on October 6 after he tested positive for COVID-19. He recovered from the infection, but his condition did not improve.Chatterjee made his debut in 1959 with Satyajit Ray's "Apur Sansar", the third film in his famous Apu series, and went on to enjoy a great actor-director relationship by starring in Ray classics like “Charulata”, “Ghare Baire”, “Devi” and “Aranyer Din Ratri”.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Chatterjee's death is a colossal loss to the world of cinema, cultural life of West Bengal and India."Through his works, he came to embody Bengali sensibilities, emotions and ethos. Anguished by his demise. Condolences to his family and admirers. Om Shanti," the PM tweeted.Condoling Chatterjee's death, Home Minister Amit Shah said the iconic actor took Bengali cinema to new heights."In Soumitra Da, Indian silver screen has lost a gem. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and countless followers. Om Shanti Shanti Shanti." Tagore, who was the late actor's first co-star in "Apur Sansar", "Devi" and other films, said Chatterjee was her closest friends."I was 13 and he was 10 years elder to me when we started working in 'Apur Sansar.' I really respected and admired him for what he stood for. He was one my oldest friends, after Tiger (husband) and Shashi Kapoor. He has been such a loyal and fun friend," Tagore told PTI."But I know he will live forever in our memories because his legacy is so immense. It encompasses so much. He wasn't only an actor. He would paint, sing, was well read, had immense knowledge of theatre, he would write poetries and short stories for his grandchildren. His interests were vast." Tagore said 'Apur Sansar' was the beginning of a beautiful friendship."The loss is tremendous but his legacy will live on forever." West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said Chatterjee, a "giant" in international, Indian and Bengali cinema, will be dearly missed."Feluda' is no more. ‘Apu' said goodbye. Farewell, Soumitra (Da) Chatterjee. He has been a legend in his lifetime. International, Indian and Bengali cinema has lost a giant. We will miss him dearly. The film world in Bengal has been orphaned," Banerjee paid homage to Chatterjee on Twitter.Sandip Ray, son of film maestro Satyajit Ray, said he had interviewed Chatterjee on September 30, a week before his hospitalisation, for a documentary."He sounded so alert. He sounded so excited. He could very well remember minute details of his shooting experiences with father including his Feluda films," he recalled.Sen recalled her first meeting with Chatterjee at the age of 14 at his residence."I used to be in awe of Soumitra Kaku during the early phase of my career in films like 'Aparichito' and 'Akash Kusum'," she said."Despite his hectic schedule in films, he could write poems, recite, draw sketches and edit little magazines like Ekshan," Sen recalled.Actor Barun Chanda said Chatterjee had a different passion for stage. He said more than matinee idol Uttam Kumar, Chatterjee was more approachable as an actor, had typical Bengaliness and used to portray different shades.From "Hemlock Society" to his last "Borun Babur Bondhu", he revealed himself as a versatile actor. He never shied away from shooting even at an advanced age, Chanda said.Actor Parambrata Chattopadhyay, who collaborated with Chatterjee on films like "Hemlock Society" and "Samataral", said he was his "very own 'Udayan Master'" but beyond all of this he was a "dear dear friend"."Last one and half years had us grow fond of each other, not as if there weren't minor disagreements now and then, like the way it happens between friends. but respect and love only grew abundantly."A big piece tears away from my existence today, a precious tie severed. Impossible to articulate how it feels to lose a friend Who also is a teacher," he wrote."This year will take it all. Parents, legends, childhood, nostalgia. All of it. Merciless year," Swastika Mukherjee, who had worked with the legend in films like "Rupe Tomay Bholabo Na" and "Hemanter Pakhi", wrote.Director Goutam Ghosh told PTI Chatterjee had a renaissance mind."He was the combination of a cerebral actor who would effortlessly sink into the character." Filmmaker Onir took to Twitter and posted movie stills of the screen icon, saying "world cinema will celebrate this beautiful man and his art for eternity".Actor Rahul Bose, who worked with Chatterjee in Aparna Sen's "15 Park Avenue", said it was a "privilege" to work with the man whose films he grew up watching."Tragic loss!! Rest in peace Sir!! Your contribution to the Indian Cinema will always be remembered and inspire the generations to come!" actor Manoj Bajpayee said. Writer-lyricist Varun Grover said the world will keep revisiting Chatterjee's eyes, stories, and gentle mystery - "as if they are an ancient Mantra"."Science can explain how we evolved from just another hunter-gatherer species to creators of abstract art in a span of Rs50k years and still, nothing can explain the sublime magic some artists manage to ignite in just Rs50 years," Grover tweeted."You tried to find meaning. Sometimes by being Ray saab's alter-ego and sometimes the viewer's. Go well & thanks for stopping by," he added.Actor Richa Chadha shared a black-and-white picture of Chatterjee and Ray engrossed in a conversation."RIP Soumitra Chatterjee! You live on through your work for eternity! Thank you for the movies. A big, big loss to the world of cinema and art. An era has indeed ended with no one in sight to fill the void," Chadha said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also condoled the legendary actor's death."It’s sad to hear of the demise of Dadasaheb Phalke awardee Shri Soumitra Chatterjee, an actor par excellence who the nation has revered over the years. My heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and fans," he wrote. Chatterjee, who starred in more than 300 films in his career, was a three-time National Award winner who enjoyed huge popularity as a matinee idol in Bengal after Uttam Kumar.He was honoured with Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India's highest award in cinema in 2012.The actor was also known for playing iconic Bengali private investigator Feluda in Ray's "Sonar Kella" and "Joi Baba Felunath".His storied filmography in his twilight years features titles, including "Bela Sheshe" (2015), short film "Ahalya" (2015), "Samantaral" (2017), National Award winning "Mayurakshi" (2017), "Sanjhbati" (2019), among several others.Chatterjee is also the first Indian film personality to be conferred with the Commandeur de l' Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, France's highest award for artists.

A decision on opening tourist sites is yet not taken."Aurangabad Collector Sunil Chavan said he has met several people who are dependent on tourism for their bread and butter."They are facing problems trouble and even the hotel industry here has demanded that monuments be reopened. The district administration is preparing a proposal for this and it will be sent to the state government," he said.The Archeological Survey of India's (ASI) Aurangabad circle is also planning to write to the state government over the issue."We are prepared for reopening the monuments and permission of the state is awaited.

15-11-2020||Patna||Suspense on deputy CM, other ministers in Bihar||With the election of Nitish Kumar as the leader of the ruling NDA in Bihar, all eyes are now set on who will be his deputy and other ministerial colleagues in his government.There is some suspense whether Sushil Kumar Modi will continue as deputy chief minister or if the saffron party would choose a new face.Also read: Bihar govt formation: NDA meeting under way, Nitish set to return as CMNames of eight-term MLA from Gaya town Prem Kumar and that of Kameshwar Choupal, a Dalit MLC who had laid the foundation stone for the temple at Ayodhya in the 1990s, are also doing the rounds for the post in the political circles.However, Prem Kumar said, "I have not been staking any claim. We are all committed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's dream of making Bihar Atmanirbhar. NDA leaders will amicably decide who should be the leader and the deputy leader.”There are strong indications that Sushil Modi, who has been deputy chief minister since 2005 and is known to share an excellent rapport with Kumar, may be retained.Sushil Modi accompanied Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who is in Bihar to oversee the NDA meeting in the run-up to the government formation, from the state guesthouse to the chief minister's residence giving credence to the speculations about the deputy CM's post.Also, it will be interesting to see who all from the four NDA constituents --  the BJP, JD(U), Hindustani Awam Morcha and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) – form the state cabinet. The outgoing Bihar government had a total of 30 ministers, including Nitish Kumar and Sushil Modi.Among them, 18 were from the JD(U) and the rest 12 from the BJP.With the BJP emerging as the largest party in the NDA with 74 MLAs and the JD(U)'s tally going down to 43 from 71, it would be interesting to see if the saffron party, which has sacrificed the post of the chief minister in honour of its pre-poll promise, will insist on having a larger share in the cabinet.A total of 24 ministers of the previous cabinet had contested the polls and 10 of them, both from both the JD(U) and the BJP, lost.Kumar, Sushil Modi and four others are members of the state's Legislative Council and did not contest the polls.Among the losing ministers from the JD(U) are Shailesh Kumar, Santosh Kumar Nirala, Jay Kumar Singh, Krishnandan Verma, Ram Sevak Singh, Ramewsh Rishideo, Khursid alias Firoz Ahmed and Lakshmeshwar Rai.From the BJP, Suresh Kumar Sharma and Brij Kumar Bind are the two ministers who lost.Since, two pre-poll constituents HAM and VIP have won four seats each, pushing the NDA's tally past the magic figure of 122, there will be representation from them in the cabinet this time.Jitan Ram Manjhi, who heads the HAM has made it clear that since he has already served as chief minister he won't take up any ministerial assignment.

Head of the research Saurabh Agarwal will determine the dosage of the vaccine to be administered. One dose will be administered and the condition of volunteers will be monitored to determine whether they need further doses or not," he said.Kamal said the volunteers' vitals and condition will be checked periodically and the data will be analysed to determine whether the vaccine is a success or not.He said the effect of the vaccine on the volunteers will be studied for seven months after the same is administered once, twice or thrice within an interval of 21 days.After observing the effects of the vaccine for a month, authorities will be apprised of the results of the trial, and they will then make a decision accordingly.The Ethics Committee of the college has also given permission for the trails, he said.The vaccine has to be kept at a temperature of -20 to -70 degrees Celsius.In September, Dr Reddy's and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia's sovereign wealth fund, entered into a partnership to conduct clinical trials of Sputnik V vaccine and its distribution in India.As part of the partnership, RDIF shall supply 100 million doses of the vaccine to Dr Reddy's upon regulatory approval in India.On August 11, the Sputnik V vaccine was registered by the Ministry of Health of Russia and became the world's first registered vaccine against COVID-19 based on the human adenoviral vector platform.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-batch-of-sputnik-v-vaccine-to-arrive-in-kanpur-medical-college-170672

15-11-2020||New Delhi||Proposed mining reforms in a month; at least 500 blocks to be auctioned in 2-3 yrs: Joshi||The Centre is planning to come out with the proposed mining reforms in a month or so and the auction of mineral blocks will kickstart two to three months after the amendments take place, Coal and Mines Minister Pralhad Joshi has said.The mines ministry had earlier sought suggestions from the general public, mining industry and other stakeholders on the proposed reforms in the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957.“We want to bring these reforms very shortly...In another month or so reforms (proposed mining reforms) should come out,” Joshi said in an interview to PTI.The government, he said, is looking into the feedback it has received on the proposed reforms and stressed that the Centre wishes to auction at least 500 mineral blocks in the coming two to three years.The slew of reform proposals include amending the contentious provisions of 10A(2)(b) and 10A (2)(C) of the MMDR Act, a move that would pave the way for auctioning of around 500 potential leases stuck in legacy issues now.Section 10A(2)(b) deals with leases where reconnaissance permit or prospecting licence were granted while 10A(2)(c) relates to grant of mining leases.Joshi said there is mixed opinion on 10A(2)(b) and 10A (2)(C) of the Act and stressed that it does not want to go into the details on the same.The mines minister was of the view that the Centre would have to convince state governments before the auction of mineral blocks as the mines ministry was just the policymaker and “rest (with regard to auction) is with the state government”.Under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat scheme, the Centre had in May announced enhancing private investments in the mineral sector and bringing in other reforms.In order to implement the announcements, the mines ministry has proposed legislative amendments to the MMDR Act, 1957, for undertaking structural reforms in the mineral sector with the objective of accelerating growth and employment generation.The proposals include increasing mineral production and employment generation by redefining the norms of exploration for auction of mineral blocks and ensuring a seamless transition from exploration to production.They also include resolving legacy issues to move towards an auction only regime for allocation of mineral resources, removing the distinction between captive and non-captive mines, developing a transparent National Mineral Index and clarifying the definition of illegal mining, among others.

15-11-2020||Nonika Singh||Soumitra Chatterjee: His dexterity was as intricate weave of Persian carpet||Covid-19 has snatched yet another stalwart. As the doyen of Bengali cinema Soumitra Chatterjee breathed his last after battling post Covid complications, it’s not just the Bengali film industry that mournsbut the world of cinema stands poorer. Best known for his association with Satyajit Ray with whom he worked in over 14 films, it is believed that Ray especially made the third part of his famous Apu trilogy after having met Soumitra.Soumitra cut his filmy teeth with Apur Sansar in 1959. So completewas the director-actor understanding that he was to later earn the sobriquet of alter ego of Ray. But the name that really stuck on Soumitra was Feluda. Indeed, cinephiles would never forget the youngdetective Feluda, Ray’s character from his book series which he played in Ray’s Sonar Kella and Joi Baba Felunath. Though he did not consider himself Ray’s equal and in interview after interview spoke about his mentor in glowing terms, in Ray’s penultimate film Shakha Proshakha, they did work as a team.Besides, Ray, he was directed by other thespians like Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha and Tarun Majumdar. Despite feelers from the very best in Hindi film industry, he was not charmed. His pan-India presence may have been felt rarely and as recent as 2015 with short film Ahalya which created a stir and went viral in no time. Director Sujoy Ghosh admitted that the real reason for making the film was to seize the opportunity to work with a great actor like Soumitra. Great he was there is little doubt. A master-class in acting, his performances would inspire generations as his fan list includes brilliant actors like Naseeruddin Shah. If as an actor he could say the same line in 20 different ways, off screen he could not only recite Tagore and other poets at the drop of a hat, but also write many a sterling poem and had dozens of books to his credit.Versatility not only defined his multifaceted persona (poet, playwright, theatre director, editor) but also his acting. Acting till his last days in his own biopic, the film in the making is likely to throw greater light on his journey and achievements dotted with honours such as the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, France’s highest award for artistes. But that is forthe uninitiated. Those who knew him and saw him onscreen in hundreds of films are well versed with his graph that only saw a natural progression. Much before actors would lend a realistic touch to filmheroes he spoke in the language of real people. Though he would draw from the cesspools of imagination, his style was naturalistic.Shyam Benegal would compare his dexterity to the intricate weave of aPersian carpet. So exquisite that few knew the hard work that went in its making.Padma Bhushan and Dadasaheb Phalke recipient, acting as Soumitra said in an interview was his calling and not a career. That is the very reason why he chose Bengali cinema over the razzmatazz of Bollywoodand precisely why he would forever remain one of Bengal’s significant Renaissance men.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/soumitra-chatterjee-his-dexterity-was-as-intricate-weave-of-persian-carpet-170667
15-11-2020||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Woman dies after acid attack by boyfriend||A woman has died after her boyfriend allegedly threw acid on her and tried to set her ablaze in Maharashtra's Beed district, a police official said on Sunday.The incident took place on Saturday, he said, adding that the reason behind the attack was not yet known.The woman, originally hailing from Shelgaon in Nanded district, was travelling from Pune to her native place along with the accused, identified as Avinash Rajure (25), he said.They took a halt at a lonely spot at Yalamb Ghat in Beed where the accused allegedly attacked the woman with acid and later tried to set her on fire by dousing her in petrol, another official from Neknur police station in Beed said.The accused then fled from the spot, he said.The woman was later taken to a hospital where she died, the official said.The victim's age was not specified by police."The incident took place around 3 am on Saturday and the police came to know about it in the afternoon.

15-11-2020||Patna||Nitish to return as Bihar CM again, but without Sushil Modi as his deputy||The NDA on Sunday chose JD(U) president Nitish Kumar for another term as the Chief Minister of Bihar even as suspense hung over the fate of his most trusted man in the BJP Sushil Kumar Modi who has served as his deputy for major part of his tenure so far.Kumar’s name was announced at 1, Anney Marg, the Chief Ministers official residence, by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh who had been sent from Delhi as the “observer” for the BJP, which has returned with the highest number of seats in the NDA in the assembly elections.“Nitish Kumar was unanimously elected as the NDA legislature party leader. Our MLAs Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi were respectively elected as the leader and deputy leader of the BJP legislature party,” Singh told reporters later.Kumar, who met Governor Phagu Chauhan along with leaders like BJP state president Sanjay Jaiswal to stake claim for the formation of a new government, said the swearing in would take place “tomorrow, between 4 and 4.30 P.M.” and curtly replied “it will be decided in due course” when asked who were likely to take oath as members of his state cabinet.Rajnath Singh, a former BJP national president, who was accompanied by Sushil Kumar Modi for most part of his day-long visit, however ducked queries about who would be the new Deputy CM.“You will come to know about it at an appropriate time”, said Singh even as Modi himself dropped ample hints about the happenings within the party.The senior BJP leader, who is an avid user of social media, had his designation as Deputy CM dropped from his Twitter handle.He also congratulated Tarkishore Prasad and Renu Devi and came out with a cryptic tweet about his own future in the BJP.“Few might have got from the BJP and the RSS as much as I did in my 40 years of political career. I will fulfill whatever responsibility that comes my way in future. Nobody can, after, all, snatch away from me the post of a party worker,” Modi said in the tweet.Union minister Giriraj Singh, considered one of the detractors of Nitish Kumar in the BJP and not known to be on the best of terms with Sushil Kumar Modi, came out with a tongue in cheek response.“Respected Sushil Kumar Modi ji, you are a leader, you held the office of Deputy CM and will remain a BJP leader. One does not become great or small because of a post,” Singh tweeted.The names of Tarkishore Prasad, a Vaishya who is known to be close to Sushil Modi, and Renu Devi  an Extremely Backward Caste (EBC) who was formerly the party’s national vice president  kept doing the rounds for the Deputy CMs post though no official confirmation came till late in the evening.Speculations about Prasad grew stronger late in the evening as he drove to the Chief Ministers office alongside BJP national general secretary in charge of the state Bhupendra Yadav and former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis who was made the party’s in charge for the assembly elections.Prasad’s residence in Katihar was also abuzz with murmurs of “badi zimmedari” (big responsibility) even as family members were busy lighting candles by way of celebration.Prasad himself refrained from divulging much as in reply to persistent queries from journalists he said little more than “I shall function in whatever capacity my party asks me to”.There were also speculations that Bihar might go for two Deputy CMs like in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh and Prasad and Renu Devi might be elevated as a step in that direction.The proposed replacement of Sushil Kumar Modi called “Chhota Modi” in the political circles of Bihar, a jocular reference to the surname he shares with Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being viewed as a precursor to the BJPs ambitious plans of aggressively expanding its own base in Bihar, where it has played second fiddle to the JD(U) boss so far.Kumar is also understood to have tactically remarked at the NDA meeting that he was in favour of “a BJP CM”, but was agreeing to take up the job again “because of the insistence” of the saffron party.The BJP leadership, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had been emphatically stating that Kumar will be retained as CM even if his JD(U)s strength in were to shrink in the assembly polls.The BJP is said to be wary of Kumar, sore over rebellion of Chirag Paswan’s LJP, gravitating towards the opposition Grand Alliance.There have also been speculations that the BJP, which has 74 MLAs against only 43 of JD(U), was likely to insist on having a greater share in the council of ministers and have one of its members as the Speaker, a post which has been with the Kumar’s party ever since he took over a decade and a half ago.In addition to the two aforementioned parties, the NDA in Bihar includes smaller allies Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) and Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM).HAM president Jitan Ram Manjhi, a former Chief Minister, has ruled himself out of joining the new ministry and is said to be lobbying for his son Santosh Suman who is a member of the legislative council.The VIP is in a peculiar position as all its four MLAs are said to be BJP cadre who fought on the fledgling outfit’s symbol, while the two-year-old party’s founding president Mukesh Sahni, a former Bollywood set designer, himself lost in the elections. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nitish-to-return-as-bihar-cm-again-but-without-sushil-modi-as-his-deputy-170663
15-11-2020||New Delhi||More ICU beds, testing  to deal with Delhi's COVID surge||With Delhi reeling from a fresh spike in COVID-19 cases, the Centre on Sunday announced a slew of steps including making available 300 additional ICU beds, double the number of daily RTPCR tests and a house-to-house survey in the entire national capital.Union Home Minister Amit Shah also said some of the hospitals under the municipal corporations of Delhi will be converted into dedicated COVID hospitals.Doctors and paramedics of paramilitary forces will be flown in to be deployed in the national capital to deal with the shortage of manpower.The decisions were taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Shah and attended by Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan among others.It was the second major intervention by Shah since June when he had stepped in and announced several steps to check the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the national capital after criticism in different quarters of the Delhi government’s handling of the crisis.Sunday’s meeting was convened in the wake of the rising number of cases, which is being called the ‘third wave’ of COVID-19, in Delhi and it noted the increasing strain on medical infrastructure in the city.Scaling up tests, hospital capacity  In a series of tweets in Hindi, Shah said daily RTPCR tests in Delhi will be doubled and the capacity of the testing laboratories will be enhanced.He said mobile testing vans of the Union Health Ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) will be deployed in the areas where the COVID-19 threat is high.Currently, around 18,000 to 19,000 RTPCR tests are conducted daily in Delhi.Shah said the meeting resolved to enhance the capacity of Delhi’s hospitals and in this direction, 300 ICU beds will be made available at the DRDO COVID hospital (Dhaula Kuan) in addition to the existing 250 ICU beds.The home minister said to increase the number of oxygen beds, the 10,000-bedded Chhatarpur COVID care centre will be strengthened and some of the hospitals of the municipal corporations of Delhi will be converted into dedicated COVID hospitals.After the meeting, Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal, however, said around 750 ICU beds will be arranged at the DRDO centre and daily testing will be scaled up to 1-1.25 lakh in coming the days.“The Centre has assured that in the next two days 500 ICU beds will be made available at the DRDO centre and after a few more days 250 more ICU beds will be arranged. So, around 750 ICU beds will be available there.”  Kejriwal said another decision taken in the meeting was to scale up daily tests from around 60,000 (RTPCR and rapid antigen tests) to 1-1.25 lakh daily.A home ministry statement said Shah directed the Health Ministry to make arrangements for requisite numbers of BIPAP machines and high flow nasal canulas to the Delhi government within the next two days.House-to-house survey in the entire Delhi will be conducted by the teams of AIIMS, Delhi government and municipal corporations of Delhi and all the symptomatic persons found in the survey would be tested and provided the necessary treatment.The health ministry will issue a standard protocol for plasma therapy and plasma administration for the treatment of COVID-19 patients immediately.Mobile testing laboratories will be deployed by the health ministry and ICMR in areas where poor and vulnerable sections of the society reside, the statement said.Dedicated multi-departmental teams will visit all the private hospitals in Delhi to physically check the availability of Covid-19 medical infrastructure vis-a-vis the admission status.The meeting resolved that the Delhi government and Delhi Police will strictly enforce the necessary measures, especially wearing of face masks, so that there is no laxity in the observance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. It was presented in the meeting that the number of active cases per day has increased substantially but the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) continues to remain in control.The health and medical infrastructure, such as dedicated Covid-19 beds, beds with ventilators, and ICUs, is already showing signs of strain, the statement said.Accordingly, it is essential to enhance surveillance, strictly enforce containment measures, increase testing, and rapidly build up the requisite medical infrastructure, it said.The government also decided to temporarily shift some testing laboratories from other parts of the country, where they are unutilised, to Delhi.The home minister also emphasised that the entire set of containment measures instituted earlier should be reviewed continuously, so that there are no gaps in implementing these measures.The officers considered, particularly those at district levels, would be personally responsible for ensuring compliance in this regard, and any deviation observed in this regard would be viewed seriously.Shah said that the situation of COVID-19 in Delhi, as also in the neighbouring areas of the National Capital Region (NCR), would be reviewed on a continuous basis over the coming weeks.No restrictions yetKejriwal said there was no discussion in the meeting on possible restrictions in Delhi in view of the rising COVID-19 cases, and added the home ministry will perhaps hold a meeting in this regard on Monday.On November 2, a meeting convened by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla had attributed the third surge in coronavirus cases in Delhi to festivals and a greater movement of people, accompanied by laxity in adhering to the basic principles of COVID-appropriate behaviour.The national capital had recorded its highest single-day spike of 8,593 COVID-19 cases on Wednesday. On Thursday, 104 fatalities, the highest in a day in over five months, were recorded.According to the health bulletin issued on Saturday, the tally of active cases rose to 44,456 in the national capital while the recovery rate stood at over 89 per cent. The number of containment zones in Delhi was 4,288 as on Saturday.The National Centre for Disease Control, in a report drafted recently, had warned that Delhi needed to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh COVID-19 cases per day, taking into account the winter-related respiratory problems, a large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings.In June, when the number of COVID-19 cases was on the rise in Delhi, there were complaints of non-availability of beds in hospitals and difficulty in getting tests done in laboratories.Leading from the front, the home minister ensured that the facilities were augmented by increasing the numbers of daily testing, hospital beds and setting up of temporary hospitals and COVID care centre.A committee set up by Shah also fixed the rates for testing, beds in private hospitals, ICUs and isolation beds. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/more-icu-beds-testing%C2%A0-to-deal-with-delhis-covid-surge-170660
15-11-2020||Kolkata||Legendary actor Soumitra Chatterjee dies at Kolkata hospital||“‘Feluda’ is no more. ‘Apu’ said goodbye. Farewell, Soumitra (Da) Chatterjee”, tweeted West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee after the death of 85-year-old Dadasahed Phalke Award recipient Soumitra Chatterjee on Sunday afternoon.While Chatterjee did play ‘Feluda’ in the two movies made by Satyajit Ray on the fictional detective created by him for his hugely popular whodunit stories, Chatterjee played ‘Apu’ in only one of the three movies known famously as the ‘Apu Trilogy’.Chatterjee played the grown up ‘Apu’ in the movie ‘Apur Sansar’. This was also the debut movie of Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore, who played the character of Apu’s wife Aparna.Tiger Pataudi, the real life husband of Tagore, and Chatterjee were buddies. Recently, Chatterjee, while giving an interview, recalled how he and the ace cricketer went bar hopping in Kolkata in the middle of a test match. Despite the binge the Nawab put up a fine performance the following day and showed that he was not called Tiger for nothing.“Soumitra seldom missed a test match. He would always be in the stadium if there was a test match. But he did not like watching IPL”, Samabaran Banerjee, former national selector who has captained West Bengal side for Ranji Trophy, and also happened to be a pal of Chatterjee, said.In his long movie career, Soumitra has never played a cricketer. He, however, put up a memorable performance as a swimming coach in the movie “Kony”.“He was the last of the Mohicans from the golden era of Bengali films”, award winning filmmaker Gulbagar Singh said.Chatterjee was admitted to hospital on October 6 after testing COVID positive. His condition steadily deteriorated finally resulting into his death on Sunday. By the time he passed away, his test results for COVID showed negative.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who visited the hospital after learning about Chatterjee’s death, took an active part in organising an elaborate last journey for the iconic actor. From hospital the body was taken to his residence and from there it was brought to technician’s studio. Before cremation at Keoratola,  the body was kept in state at Rabindra Sadan cultural centre for two hours for people to pay their last respect.  Dr Arjun Dasgupta of West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, when asked if giving a go by to all COVID protocols for the disposal of corpses for the iconic actor, said Chatterjee had tested negative before his death and so observation of the protocol was not necessary.“All over the world, the protocol regarding disposal of bodies of COVID victims were being relaxed”, Dasgupta told this reporter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/legendary-actor-soumitra-chatterjee-dies-at-kolkata-hospital-170656

I am also concerned about it. We have been taking all appropriate measures to control it. We are considering taking more steps next week. I think the situation should come under control in seven to 10 days and the cases should start decreasing," he had said.Delhi recorded 7,802 fresh COVID-19 cases in a day taking the infection tally in the national capital to over 4.74 lakh on Friday, while 91 more fatalities during the same period pushed the death toll to 7,423.

15-11-2020||New Delhi||Slight improvement in air quality as Delhi-NCR receives light rain||Amid the "emergency level" pollution prevailing in the NCR post Diwali, the national capital and its adjoining areas received light rain showers on Sunday evening, bringing slight relief to the residents struggling against the severe PM2.5 and PM 10 pollutant levels.The AQI of Delhi improved from 525 in the noon to 490 post the rain.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had forecast "light to moderate" rain over Delhi-NCR.It had stated that a fresh western disturbance is likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in the region. The areas likely to receive rainfall included parts of New Delhi, along with Jhajjar, Gurugram, Bahadurgarh, Faridabad, Noida, Greater Noida, and Ghaziabad."The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from east/southeast direction of Delhi with wind speed upto 16-30 kmph, generally cloudy sky and light rain/thundershowers accompanied by gusty winds (speed 30-40 kmph) towards afternoon/ evening on 15.11.2020," the central agency said in its weather bulletin.Earth Science Ministry officials had also forecast in their morning air quality update that the AQI is likely to start improving from the afternoon and settle in the lower end of "very poor" category on Monday. They also said that the AQI may touch the "poor" category in case of enough rains and washout.Earlier, the ministry had predicted the AQI to remain in the middle-end of the "very poor" category on November 17 and 18. However, only drizzling may trigger secondary particulate formation to only slightly improve the current level to balance the recovery, but it has very less probability, it had said.On Sunday morning, after the Diwali celebrations, a thick blanket of noxious smog had enveloped the national capital and shot up the pollution in the city to "emergency" level on Sunday where the hourly average concentrations of PM 2.5, a deadly pollutant, touched more than 1000ug/m3 at midnight, the Ministry officials had said.The satellite towns had also shown emergency and severe level readings of AQI. The situation has followed after the non-compliance of the people to desist from bursting crackers.As per System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the overall AQI of Delhi in the morning remained 525 while in Noida, it crossed 600 with PM 10 being the lead pollutant.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) measured AQI in Ghaziabad at 473, in Greater Noida at 432, and Gurugram at 425.

15-11-2020||New Delhi||India summons Pak Charge d’Affaires over ceasefire violations along LoC||India on Saturday summoned the Charge d’Affaires of the Pakistan High Commission and lodged a strong protest with him over the unprovoked ceasefire violations by Pakistani forces on multiple sectors along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir targeting innocent civilians on the eve of Diwali.  The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) condemned, in the strongest terms, the “deliberate targeting” of innocent civilians by Pakistani forces and said it was highly deplorable that Pakistan chose a festive occasion in India to disrupt peace and perpetrate violence in Jammu and Kashmir through coordinated firing along the the LoC.“The Charge d’Affaires of the High Commission of Pakistan was summoned by the Ministry of External Affairs today and a strong protest was lodged over unprovoked ceasefire violations by Pakistani forces, on multiple sectors along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir on November 13, resulting in the death of four innocent civilians and serious injuries to 19 others,” the MEA said.Triggering a major flare-up along the LoC on the eve of Diwali, Pakistan resorted to heavy shelling in several areas along the LoC in north Kashmir killing five security personnel apart from the civilians following which Indian Army mounted a major retaliation pounding several Pakistani positions with anti-tank guided missiles and artillery guns.Indian military sources said at least eight Pakistani soldiers were killed and 12 others injured in the retaliation.“India condemns, in the strongest terms, the deliberate targeting of innocent civilians by Pakistani forces,” the MEA said in a statement.“It is highly deplorable that Pakistan chose a festive occasion in India to disrupt peace and perpetrate violence in J and K through coordinated firing along the length of the LoC using heavy caliber weapons, including artillery and mortar on Indian civilians,” it said.The MEA also reminded Pakistan of its bilateral commitment to not allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India in any manner.“India also strongly protested Pakistan’s continued support to cross border terrorist infiltration into India, including through supporting cover fire provided by Pakistan forces,” the MEA said.According to official data, Pakistan has resorted to 4,052 incidents of ceasefire violations in the current year as against 3,233 in 2019.Notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic in the region, Pakistan has been resorting to unprovoked ceasefire violations along the LoC and making concerted efforts to push militants into Kashmir.Pakistani hostilities increased after India announced its decision to withdraw the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and divide the state into two union territories in August last year.Meanwhile, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said he lit a lamp to express his gratitude to the soldiers of the country on the occasion of Diwali.On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to the people to light a ‘diya’ as a “salute to soldiers”, saying words cannot do justice to the sense of gratitude for their exemplary courage.“Prime Minister @NarendraModi requested all countrymen to lit a lamp in honor of our soldiers during the festival of Deepawali. I have also lit a lamp today to express my gratitude to the soldiers of India,” Singh tweeted.The defence minister said when the country was celebrating Diwali, Indian soldiers were performing their national duty of protecting the borders.“I salute such brave and dutiful soldiers,” Singh said.

15-11-2020||Washington||US President-elect Biden, his deputy Harris, incumbent President Trump send Diwali greetings||US President-elect Joe Biden, his deputy Kamala Harris and incumbent President Donald Trump on Saturday extended Diwali greetings to those celebrating the festival of lights."To the millions of Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Buddhists celebrating the Festival of Lights, @DrBiden and I send our best wishes for a #HappyDiwali. May your new year be filled with hope, happiness, and prosperity. Sal Mubarak," President-elect Biden tweeted.Harris, who scripted history by becoming the first Indian-American and Black woman Vice President in the US, extended greetings on the occasion of Diwali."Happy Diwali and Sal Mubarak! @DouglasEmhoff and I wish everyone celebrating around the world a safe, healthy, and joyous new year,” Vice President-elect Harris tweeted.In a joint statement, Biden and Harris wished a happy Diwali to everyone celebrating the festival of lights across the US, India, and the world."Like so many cherished traditions during the pandemic, we know this year's Diwali and its symbolising of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and empathy over apathy arrives with a deeper meaning," they said."Our hearts go out to everyone who is ushering in this new year with the recent loss of a loved one, or who finds themselves fallen on hard times. Our prayers remain with everyone fighting the pandemic on the frontlines instead of staying safe at home in prayer with their families. And, we know the sadness of being apart on a day that truly signifies the blessing of family and friendship," they said."But Diwali is ultimately a reminder of the light that's within us all to hope and dream, and to overcome our differences and keep the faith in each other. That's the light we see shining on this day and that will guide us through the darkness with knowledge, science, truth, unity, and compassion,” the joint statement said."And that's why as Diwali is celebrated via video calls and while socially distanced this year, we look forward to celebrating Diwali at the White House next year - in person, together with you, and in a nation healed and united," they said.President Trump, a Republican, who was defeated by Biden in the November 3 presidential election, shared a picture of him lighting a lamp in the White House along with Indian American members of his administration.'Happy Diwali' was written on the photo."During this Festival of Lights, friends, neighbours, and loved ones join in fellowship to commemorate the spiritual triumph of good over evil, light over darkness, and knowledge over ignorance. As diyas are lit throughout homes, workplaces, communities, and places of worship, their warmth reminds us of the hope and devotion that faith and tradition bring into our lives,” Trump said in his Diwali greetings."The United States is a deeply faithful nation, and I am proud of my Administration's work defending the constitutional right of all Americans to live and worship according to their conscience. Wherever Americans light diyas to celebrate Diwali, our Nation shines bright as a beacon of religious liberty for all people,” he said."This year, we are especially reminded to cherish and give thanks for the companionship of our friends and family. The First Lady and I wish the millions of people in the United States and around the world observing Diwali a joyous celebration and prosperous new beginnings,” Trump said.Vice President Mike Pence greeted happy Diwali to all those celebrating the festival around the world.Earlier, Secretary of the State Mike Pompeo also extended greetings on Diwali."Happy Diwali to everyone celebrating the victory of light over darkness. May you have a joyous Festival of Lights!” tweeted Pompeo, who is currently on a seven-nation tour to Europe and Middle East. "Happy Diwali! We wish everyone safety and good health as you celebrate Festival of Lights. Even if physically apart from family and friends, may the spirit of the season bring joy and light,” said South and Central Asia Bureau of the State Department."Sending warm wishes to everyone celebrating the Festival of Lights as you commemorate this holiday through prayer, lighting diyas and lanterns, and feasts and other festivities. On behalf of the State Department, we wish you a happy Diwali!” said Deputy Spokesman of the State Department Cale Brown.The overarching theme of Diwali is a celebration of the victory of good over evil, light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance, said Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in his Diwali greetings."Wishing you love and light, from my home to yours-happy #Diwali!" said Indian American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal in her Diwali greetings."As we open a new chapter after a critical election, I can think of no better time to call in the spirit of this Festival of Lights. Let it remind us that dharma-goodness, duty, righteousness-must always prevail,” Jayapal said. "As we call in the spirit of this Festival of Lights, let us continue to oppose the forces of hate, racism, and xenophobia that seek to divide us while also calling out injustice wherever we see it,” she said in another tweet.

15-11-2020||New Delhi||Diwali: Delhi's air quality turns 'severe'; firecrackers add to misery||Delhi's air quality turned "severe" on Saturday with stubble burning accounting for 32 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution and firecracker emissions making the situation even worse.A layer of haze lingered over Delhi-NCR at night as people continued bursting firecrackers despite a ban, and calm winds allowing accumulation of pollutants.The level of PM2.5 – which is about three per cent the diameter of a human hair and can lead to premature deaths from heart and lung diseases – was 331 microgram per cubic metre (µg/m3) in Delhi-NCR at 10 pm, above the emergency threshold of 300 µg/m3.The safe limit is 60 µg/m3.The PM10 level stood at 494 µg/m3 at 10 pm, precariously close to the emergency threshold of 500 µg/m3, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.According to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), the air quality is considered in the "severe plus" or "emergency" category if PM2.5 and PM10 levels persist above 300 µg/m3 and 500 µg/m3 respectively for more than 48 hours.Earlier, the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, had said that the PM2.5 concentration in Delhi on Diwali was "likely to be the lowest" of the last four years if no firecrackers are burnt.However, it had said that even a small increase in local additional emissions is likely to have "a significant deterioration impact on Sunday and Monday".It said peak levels of PM10 and PM2.5 are expected between 1 am and 6 am in case of additional internal emissions.The city recorded an overall AQI of 414 at 4 pm on Saturday. It soared to 454 by 10 pm.The 24-hour average AQI was 339 on Friday and 314 on Thursday.Delhi recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 337 on Diwali last year (October 27), and 368 and 400 in the next two days. Thereafter, pollution levels remained in the "severe" category for three days on the trot.In 2018, the 24-hour average AQI (281) on Diwali was recorded in the "poor" category. It deteriorated to 390 the next day and remained in the "severe" category on three consecutive days thereafter.In 2017, Delhi's 24-hour average AQI on Diwali (October 19) stood at 319. It, however, slipped into the "severe" zone the next day.This time, the India Meteorological Department has said that a fresh western disturbance is likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in Delhi-NCR post Diwali.Light rain is likely on Sunday under the influence of a western disturbance. It is still to be seen if it is enough to wash away pollutants, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said."However, Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to improve post Diwali due to an expected increase in the wind speed on Sunday," he said.V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environment research centre, said the wind speed is expected to pick up thereafter and the wind direction will be east-southeasterly.There will be a significant improvement in air quality by November 16, Soni said.The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi also said the situation is likely to "improve significantly" on Sunday."Under the influence of a Western Disturbance, isolated rainfall over plains of northwest India and adjoining central India is likely on Sunday. The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from East-Southeast direction of Delhi with wind speed up to 20 kmph," it said."Generally cloudy sky, light rain, thundershowers accompanied with gusty winds (speed 30-40 kmph) is likely towards afternoon-evening on Sunday," the central agency said.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Friday directed the CPCB and the states concerned to ensure there is no lapse in the implementation of the National Green Tribunal's directions in view of the air quality scenario during the Diwali period."In pursuance of NGT order dated November 9 and considering the concerns of air quality scenario in the NCR and its adverse health impact, the commission directed CPCB, state governments and authorities concerned for strict compliance of the directions of NGT, with zero tolerance on violation," it said.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on Monday imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases".A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel clarified that the direction will apply to all cities and towns in the country where the average of ambient air quality during November 2019 was in "poor" and above categories."At other places, restrictions are optional for the authorities but if there are more stringent measures under orders of the authorities, the same will prevail," the NGT had said.
