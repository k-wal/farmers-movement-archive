Meanwhile, Delhi Health minister Satyendra Jain released a statement on ruling out shortage of beds in the national capital in wake of coronavirus pandemic after certain reports.“There are some misleading reports that there is a shortage of beds for the patients in Delhi because a few private hospitals are refusing admissions,” said Jain in a statement. The death tally stands at 708.He added, “There is absolutely no shortage of beds in Delhi at the moment. In the last three days, more than 1,000 patients have been admitted to various hospitals in Delhi. If beds were not available, this would have not been possible. Even now, we have close to 5,000 vacant beds. So clearly the issue is that some hospitals are not updating the data on the Delhi Corona app on time or misrepresenting actual data when patients call. Patients were not getting data on hospitals before, which the Delhi corona app is trying to fix. We are making hospital bed data live and real-time soon.”The Delhi government has issued instructions for COVID hospitals to handle of positive, suspected, patients in the hospitals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-health-minister-reacts-on-shortage-of-beds-asks-hospitals-to-submit-real-time-data-95031

The family conducted the last rites in his native Sisoli village.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took to Twitter to criticise the state’s BJP government, accusing it of not paying sugarcane dues to farmers.Singh had left home for his fields on Thursday and his body was found hanging from a tree later in the day.His family told police he was depressed over his inability to sell his sugarcane crop because of the lockdown to combat coronavirus.Authorities, however, rejected the claim that he committed suicide due to this.District Magistrate Selvakumari J said preliminary investigations revealed that the farmer killed himself due to a family dispute over land.She said there had been no stoppage in the procurement of sugarcane by mills.The district magistrate visited the protest site and announced financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh for the farmer’s family.The farmers then called off their protest and Singh’s family conducted the last rites. Family members had initially refused to cremate the farmer after his body was handed over to them following a post-mortem.Union minister Sanjeev Balyan, who represents Muzaffarnagar in Lok Sabha, also visited the protest site along with BJP’s Budhana MLA Umesh Malik.Leaders of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RJD) and the Samajwadi Party separately announced financial help of Rs 1 lakh each for the bereaved family.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Naresh Tikait said farmers have been facing big financial problems and not getting the proper price for their crop because of the lockdown.He demanded a complete waiver of electricity bills and other dues for them. The BKU also announced a compensation of Rs 50,000 for Singh’s family.Tagging a media report about the suicide, Priyanka Gandhi tweeted, “Seeing his sugarcane crop drying in the field and not getting the slip, a sugarcane farmer from Muzaffarnagar committed suicide.”      The “slip” is produced by farmers when they visit a sugar mill to sell their crop.The BJP has claimed that farmers will be paid in full within 14 days after selling their crop, but sugar mills have been closed with payments of thousands of crores still pending, she alleged.“I had brought it to the notice of the government two days ago,” the Congress general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh said.“Imagine the plight of these sugarcane farmers’ families not getting their dues during this financial crisis. But now the BJP government does not even mention a word about the payment of sugarcane dues within 14 days,” she added.

He warned that it could pave the way for disbanding the MSP regime as well as the foodgrain procurement regime, triggering unrest among the state’s farmers.Tomar, while announcing the decisions on Wednesday, had said that agricultural produce marketing legislations of respective states will continue. “It does not touch the mandis of states. All states are on in agreement (on the ordinance).“Punjab and Haryana are big producers of foodgrain. The reforms will bring a major change in the lives of their farmers. They will be free to sell produce outside APMC, including on electronic platforms, and will not be charged any cess or levy for sale. There will be a separate dispute resolution mechanism for the farmers. It will promote barrier-free inter-state and intra-state trade and commerce, reduce marketing costs for the farmers and help them in getting better prices, ” the minister had said.Tomar also made it clear that the government had no plans to scrap the MSP regime as being apprehended by farmers.“The government will continue to buy on the support price. How can the government scrap MSP when it just announced support prices (for summer crops),” he questioned while advising those “doing politics on the issue to refrain from doing so”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/president-promulgates-two-ordinances-to-boost-to-rural-trade-agriculture-95027
05-06-2020||New Delhi||International Yoga Day to be celebrated on digital platform this year||The International Yoga Day will be celebrated on digital media platforms and there would be no mass gatherings this year in view of coronavirus outbreak, the government said on Friday.This year’s theme is ‘Yoga at Home and Yoga with Family’ and people will be able to join the celebrations virtually at 7 am on June 21. The Indian Missions abroad are trying to reach out to the people through digital media as well as through the network of institutions which support yoga, officials said.The Ministry of AYUSH had planned to hold a grand event at Leh which, however, was cancelled due to the pandemic.“This year, the event will highlight the utility of yoga for individuals, to develop immunity to combat the global pandemic and strengthen the community in managing some of the significant aspects of this crisis,” Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, president, Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR) said.“In view of the highly infectious nature of the virus causing COVID-19, there shall be no mass gatherings and the International Yoga Day (IDY) will be a digital event. Hence, this year the ministry is encouraging people to practice yoga at their homes with participation from the entire family,” he said.The ministry and ICCR, through the ‘My Life - My Yoga’ video blogging competition which was launched by the prime minister on May 31, seek to raise awareness about yoga and inspire people to prepare for and become active participants in the observation of IDY 2020.The contest will run in two legs—the first one consisting of an international video blogging contest wherein the winners will be picked within a country. This will be followed by global prize winners who will be selected from different countries.To enter into the contest, participants are required to upload a three-minute video of three yogic practices (‘kriya’, ‘asana’, ‘pranayama’, ‘bandha’ or ‘mudra’), including a short video message/description on how the said yogic practices influenced their lives.They can do it in any language, Ayush Secretary Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha said.      “The video blogging competition will provide us a huge amount of testimonial which will help us in spreading the word about yoga and its overall benefits not just health-wise, but also towards the approach to human life,” Sahasrabuddhe, who is also the Rajya Sabha MP and national vice-president of BJP, said. “It will also bring to the fore the multiple facets of yoga. Yoga is not just a physical activity. It also has to do with physical and emotional health, and people will share the benefits they have experienced,” he said.The videos may be uploaded on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram with the contest hashtag #MyLifeMyYogaINDIA and appropriate category hashtag.Entries can be submitted by participants under three categories—youth (male and female aged under 18), adults (male and female above 18 years) and yoga professionals (male and female), Kotecha said.This makes it a total of six categories in all. For India contestants, prizes worth Rs 1 lakh, Rs 50,000 and Rs 25,000 will be given for first, second and third positions within each of the categories. The Indian Missions abroad will give away prizes in each country. At the global level, cash prizes worth USD 2,500, USD 1,500 and USD 1,000 along with a trophy and certificate will be given to those ranking first, second and third, respectively. “The Ministry of AYUSH is confident that this interest would convert into significant public health gains, as the positive impact of yoga in the management of many aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic situation is by now well accepted,” Kotecha said.

India had to persuade Afghanistan to shelve its ambitions and had entered into a quid pro quo with Vietnam to emerge as the sole candidate from the group. Though India’s election is all but guaranteed, a senior officer said, “We are not taking chances”.The four challenges to international peace and security were —increasing strains in international governance as frictions have increased; unchecked traditional and non-traditional security challenges; unreformed and under representative global institutions; and, grave economic repercussions from Covid that will test the world like never before.“We have always been a voice of reason and a votary of international law. We advocate dialogue, consultation and fairness in our approach to global issues,” said Jaishankar.  “India will work constructively with partners to overcome old and new fault-lines and offer innovative and inclusive solutions,” he added.At its eighth stint at UNSC where it aspires to be a permanent member, Jaishankar said India can play a “positive global role” by creating new opportunities for progress, an effective response to international terrorism, reforming the multilateral system, comprehensive approach to international peace and security and promoting technology with a human touch as a driver of solutions. India is in a G-4 grouping with Japan, South Africa and Germany in order to make a joint bid to enter an expanded UNSC. That attempt is being opposed by each country's regional rivals under the banner on “United for Consensus”, which is also known as the Coffee Club. India is opposed by Pakistan and China, Japan by South Korea, South Africa by African heavyweights Nigeria and Egypt and Germany by Italy and Spain.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-begins-campaign-for-unsc-seat-promises-solutions-to-overcome-fault-lines-95011

The petitioner also demanded a CBI probe into the Anand Vihar fiasco where a large number of migrant workers had gathered in violation of the COVID-19 lockdown.The Bench posted the matter for hearing after two weeks as the petitioner wanted to file a response to the NHA affidavit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-cbi-probe-into-markaz-incident-needed-centre-tells-sc-95009

Transparency in terms of making details of discussion and decisions of scientific advisors to the government public would give the wider scientific community a chance to offer constructive criticism on policies and perhaps help in course corrections,” he said in a letter.Further, open and transparent sharing of data with scientists, public health experts, and the public at large would strengthen pandemic control measures and help in building consensus in India, the letter stated.Dr Saraya, who has authored several papers on public health in national and international journals, emphasised in the letter that addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on society required more than the actions of healthcare professionals and policymakers alone.It called for the engagement of citizens, governments at all levels and a diverse array of organisations and individuals involved in policymaking processes and policy implementation, he said.“In this regard, the government’s leadership group also lacks social scientists and community voices, who could work on community engagement,” he said in the letter.In his letter, Dr Saraya said toward the end of the nationwide lockdown India started reporting a surge in COVID-19 infections and deaths. This was contrary to the standard government position till then, he said.“The surge led to contradictory responses by health leaders of the Union Government,” he said referring to a Health Ministry official’s claims that India’s epidemic curve was “relatively flat” and depending on how the public responds to the virus, the peak “may never come”, while a senior doctor of the government’s core COVID-19 team had said the number of cases in India was likely to peak in next one to two months.Formulating and adopting policy responses was ultimately the responsibility of the government leaders as they made strategic decisions, support coordination, and collaboration and provide public accounts of events, Dr Saraya said.However, scientific and technical experts were central in policy responses to uncertain problems, he added.The letter to the editor also mentions how a group of public health experts comprising doctors from AIIMS and two members of an ICMR research group on COVID-19 have expressed concern about the inadequate planning and coordination of the response to the pandemic and have suggested mechanisms for better planning and coordination.A joint statement by the Indian Public Health Association and the Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine representing the very wide community of public health academics, practitioners, and researchers in India had recently urged the government to form a Public Health Commission with task-specific working groups to provide real-time technical inputs to the government.

Till then, no funds should be released nor budgetary provisions be made to such schemes, instructed the Finance Ministry in an Office Memorandum.The intention is to save on expenditure in order not to incur more debt.Also read: Govt ‘clear and unapologetic’ about privatisation of PSUs: Principal Economic AdviserMoody’s has already rung the alarm bell by downgrading India to Baa2 — the lowest investment grade. Even this rating is generous since it is 30 percentage points above the median of Baa-range nations. A further downgrade will mean that India will have to borrow funds from abroad at higher interest rates.The only exceptions to the no-new-scheme instructions are the PMO-helmed ones such as the Prime Minister Gareeb Kalyan Package and the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package or any other package that may be announced subsequently.“There is unprecedented demand on public financial resources and a need to use resources prudently in accordance with emerging and changing priorities,” explained the Finance Ministry note.Meanwhile, the Centre’s Principal Economic Advisor Sanjeev Sanyal suggested that the Union Government is keeping its powder dry as it anticipates a prolonged period of slow economic growth.“The Government is not following others in re-inflating the economy with massive spending because the post-COVID world would be very different. Why waste all ammo on a world that is dying?” he asked while speaking at an online dialogue organised by the All-India Management Association (AIMA) as part of its “LeaderSpeak” series.At the dialogue with industrialists Sanjay Kirloskar, Harsh Pati Singhania, Sunil Kant Munjal, Sanjiv Mehta and Sudhir Jalan, Sanyal said it was useless to push demand during a lockdown.“We are cognizant of the demand situation and we will use fiscal and monetary measures for demand where required,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-to-axe-all-new-schemes-to-avoid-running-up-more-debt-95001

This is a major problem for the Indian army as to how to make the Chinese retrace their steps without any clashes, for the eruption in the situation is not in the interests of the two countries.Going by the reports coming from China at the moment, there is no scope of further escalation of the situation and the road for the Indian objective of the Chinese vacating its territory will come only after the PLA troops return to the pre-face-off position.Also read: China says committed to properly resolve border standoff with India ahead of key military talksWithout directly referring to the military standoff, the External Affairs Ministry said the two sides reviewed the state of bilateral relations including the current developments.“In this context, they recalled the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, that peaceful, stable and balanced relations between India and China will be a positive factor for stability in the current global situation,” the MEA said in a statement.It said both sides agreed to resolve differences in accordance with guidance provided by the leadership of two countries, in a reference to decisions taken at the two informal summits between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping.India has all well-documented records showing the Chinese intrusion into the territory where they had not ventured with such a massive strength anytime before.The Chinese argument, sources said, India was constructing in the disputed territory is untenable as India had been constructing roads and bridges for the past over 12 years linking these to its border posts and airstrips.“Both sides agreed that in accordance with the guidance provided by the leadership, the two sides should handle their differences through peaceful discussion bearing in mind the importance of respecting each other’s sensitivities, concerns and aspirations and not allow them to become disputes,” the MEA said.Sources informed about the behind-the-scene developments on this highly sensitive issue concerning the Indian sovereignty and integrity and told The Tribune that 14 Corps Commander Lt Gen Harinder Singh, who led the military delegation is finalising its talking points about the strategy to be adopted, will be at the talks on Saturday.It is going to be like moves on the chessboard where the rival is to be outmanoeuvred with the straight talk as also in the language wrapped in diplomatic parlances.China, however, has not disclosed as to who would be representing at the talks in keeping with Beijing’s secret style of operating.The Chinese indeed had some advantage but India, too, had its list of talking points of its options that it might exercise if the talks, that was destined to be a round of talks in the days and weeks to come depending on the groundwork and the mood of the talks on Saturday, sources said.They, however, did not disclose what kind of options the Indians have in such a situation that looks like a prolonged stand-off that may last longer than the 73-day-long face-off at Doklam in 2017.“The Indians will stand their ground and no concessions will be offered, come what may in lieu of the Chinese vacating the Indian territory. That’s our position and we will realise it through talks that the duration or rounds of talks are not the immediate consideration,” the source said.A veteran of such talks of international ramifications over the past few decades and a keen observer of the global affairs told The Tribune that the progress of the talks would depend on how strategic pluses and minuses were forwarded and responded to (at the face-to-face talks).“There can be no prompting from the rear nor does that ever happen,” he said.While the Chinese media has appreciated what it calls “strategic calmness” of India, it has also warned that India should have no “illusions of nibbling at borders”. — With inputs from PTIThis is seen as a strategic compulsion of China owing to the global scene as also its concerns resulting out of domestic distress because of the pandemic-stricken economy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sino-india-standoff-in-ladakh-talks-tomorrow-%C2%A0early-conclusion-not-in-sight-94991

On arrival, they are sent to institutional or home quarantine.As compared to very low testing in Telangana, AP is going in for aggressive COVID-19 testing. The results decide on the extent of quarantine at home, institution or whether to be sent to the designated health centres.“Only those found symptomatic among the domestic arrivals or departures will be handed over to the health authorities as per the government orders, and till date there is no such case,” revealed sources at the airport.The state was monitoring all arrivals by trains since last three weeks, but now even the screening for train passengers has been done away with. An estimated 80,000 passengers have arrived at Secunderabad and Hyderabad (Nampally) stations this week alone.Sources in the state’s Health department confirmed that they had stopped screening, taking down details of passengers at the Secunderabad Railway Station from June 1. “It was discontinued after relaxations on other services were implemented,” said sources.Meanwhile, COVID-19 positive cases have touched 3,147 mark, majority being from the Greater Hyderabad area.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-does-away-with-screening-of-incoming-passengers-94989

The force, which is as small as of 90,000 personnel, now has two commands. We are also reinforcing strength in the border areas owing to the standoff with the China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).”  A decision for creating two commands – one for western theatre and other for eastern theatre – was taken in October last year, but it could not be implemented owing to some administrative issue, the official said.  “But now with the two commands in place they will help the force to have better operational functioning along the border and LAC starting from Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh,” he added.The commands are designed to streamline operations, intelligence, deployment and administrative movements of ITBP personnel to the border regions and also bring better synergy with the Army that secures the LAC, the officials said.The Western Command will have control over ITBP deployments in the Dehradun-based Northern Frontier that have Shimla, Dehradun and Bareilly sectors and the North-West Frontier, that was shifted from Chandigarh to Leh in April last year and has sectors in Srinagar and Ladakh.The ITBP Leh frontier is headed by an Inspector General-rank officer who is equivalent to a Major General of the Army.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/itbp-operationalises-its-per-sanctioned-two-commands-in-chandigarh-and-guwahati-94988

Some of them have already re-opened in parts of the country and a few others are scheduled to re-start in the next phase of unlocking from next Monday.Nevertheless, COVID-19 cases and the death toll in India continued to mount. A record jump of 9,851 cases and 273 fatalities in 24 hours took the country’s COVID-19 tally on Friday to 2,26,770 and death toll to 6,348.“The new guidelines aim to instil COVID-19 appropriate behaviour to contain the chain of transmission while allowing social and economic activity to resume,” the health ministry said.According to the SOPs, restaurants, hotels, places of worship and offices in COVID-19 containment zones will remain closed and only those outside these areas will be allowed to open.Cinema halls, gaming arcades and children play areas in malls outside containment zones would be barred from opening. The SOPs included measures like allowing only asymptomatic staff, guests, customers and devotees on the premises, proper crowd management and maintaining effective and frequent sanitation, with a particular focus on lavatories, drinking and handwashing stations/areas.Recorded devotional music or songs may be played and choir or singing groups should not be allowed. Common prayer mats should be avoided and devotees should bring their own mat or piece of cloth which they may take back with them, the SOPs stated.“No physical offerings like prasad/distribution or sprinkling of holy water, etc should be allowed inside the religious place,” the Ministry said, underlining that community kitchens, langars, ‘Ann-Daan’ etc at religious places should follow physical distancing norms while preparing and distributing food.The number of active COVID-19 cases stood at 1,10,960 while 1,09,462 patients have recovered till Friday 8 AM with 5,355 having been cured in the last 24 hours, the health ministry said, adding the recovery rate was 48.27 per cent.

The state Secretariat located at Amaravati has seen about 75 COVID-19 positive cases. Many others have been tested, but their reports are still awaited.The state’s General Administration and Agriculture Department have seen many cases that have tested positive for coronavirus within the Secretariat. Another employee attached to the Principal Secretary (Revenue) was also reported positive on Thursday.A Special Protection Force constable on duty at the Legislature building, situated on the same campus, also tested positive for COVID-19, following which the authorities concerned have asked the staff to work from home.With the continuous spurt, AP has touched a figure of 4,250 positive cases, with 138 new cases reported on Friday.The death toll too increased to 73, with two fresh deaths reported on Friday.The state government is attributing the rise in cases to migrants who have returned home from other states.The government has said one 53-year-old person, who recently died of the virus at Gollala Mamidada village near Kakinada appears to have spread the infection to several persons.East Godavari Collector D Muralidhar Reddy has said the number of people infected by him could be close to 100.The administration has conducted over 7,000 tests in the village. Primary and secondary contacts of the deceased person have been screened, and so far only about 100 cases have tested positive.With more and more people testing positive, the Secretariat employees are now demanding that they be allowed to work from home in view of the virus spread. Only last week the Secretariat was fully opened after the end of the fourth phase of lockdown. But there has been a sudden rise in cases among government employees, many of whom returned from Hyderabad after a gap of two months following the government’s new directive to ensure 100 per cent attendance among Secretariat staff.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-pradesh-secretariat-in-the-grip-of-covid-94979

"We have ordered an immediate inquiry to access the damagecaused by Cyclone Nisarga. The government will provide Rs 100 cr as emergency relief," Thackeray said.Thackeray accompanied by his son and colleague Aaditya and other ministers like Aslam Shaikh, Aditi Tatkare and various officials boarded a Ro-Ro boat from Mumbai to Alibaug across the Arabian Seafrom where they toured the cyclone-hit areas.The CM said officials who were asked to file a report on the damage caused by the cyclone in two days will take longer time as the damage caused has been widespread. He added that funds will be disbursed among affected villagers as soon as possible. He also announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 4 lakh to the next of kin who died in mishaps caused by the cyclone.Addressing the media, Thackeray said the government has earmarked Rs 100 cr as emergency relief and a full package will be worked out after assessing the losses.According to officials, the cyclone damaged powerlines and telecommunication equipment.

This will help the bank improve its profitability and liquidity by releasing outstanding advances locked up in NPAs and thereby reduce its erosion level,” Gadkari added in his letter.Gadkari’s suggestion for merging PMC Bank’s branches with strong banks in their respective states comes months after NCP leader Sharad Pawar mooted a similar idea. The NCP chief had suggested merging PMC Bank’s branches in Maharashtra with the Maharashtra Urban Co-operative Bank since most of its depositors are from this state.According to the PMC Bank Depositors’ Association, 92 per cent of the bank’s branches are in Maharashtra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gadkari-suggests-merger-of-pmc-bank-branches-with-strong-local-banks-94973

They frequented the Nirman Bhawan building, sources said.“Those who had come in contact with these COVID-19 infected officials have been advised to quarantine themselves. Further contract tracing is on,” a source said, adding a few more staff had tested positive earlier.In view of these developments, the Union Health Ministry on June 4 issued a fresh office memorandum stating “it has been decided to initiate major and comprehensive disinfection and sanitisation of office premises (Nirman Bhawan) on June 6 to 7.”“Accordingly, the entire premises of the Ministry of Health and DGHS, Nirman Bhawan will remain closed from June 6 to 7 except for emergency COVID-19 team,” the memorandum read.As part of the “deep sanitisation” exercise, rooms, washrooms, doorknobs, switches, handles, tables, workstations, chairs, the armrest of chairs, sofas, almirahs, and office equipment such as computers and printers, will be sanitised.The Ministry has issued another office memorandum on June 3 advising all staff to follow precautionary measures strictly in order to contain the spread of the disease.“The number of COVID-19 positive cases are going up steadily. Many officers of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare have tested COVID-19 positive. It has been noted that at times social distancing is not being maintained in office premises,” the June 3 memo read.Listing a series of precautionary measures to be followed “strictly”, the Ministry said the wearing of masks was mandatory for all employees, only asymptomatic persons would be allowed to attend office and the staff should maintain social distancing mandatorily.Meetings and conferences should not be done physically and may be organised through video conferencing only, and work from home should be facilitated in case of an emergent situation, it said.“All JSs/EAs concerned shall ensure that their officers/staff attend office at staggered working hours as per DoPT office memorandum,” the memo stated.The Ministry advised discouraging the entry of visitors in the office complex and sanction leave whenever any request for self-quarantine is received. It also advised against using each other phones, desk and other work tools, avoiding loitering and crowding in the corridors and maintaining respiratory etiquettes.“All employees should try and use stairs as far as possible except those who may have problems using the staircase.

05-06-2020||New Delhi||Endeavour to cut accidents, deaths on roads by 25 pc by March next year: Gadkari||Against India witnessing 1.5 lakh deaths in 5 lakh road crashes annually, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, on Friday, said it was his endeavour to reduce these numbers by at least 25 per cent by the fiscal-end.Launching the UNDP national awareness campaign on ‘Prevention of Human and Animal Mortality on Highways’ via video-conference on the occasion of World Environment Day, the Road Transport Minister said steps were on to correct about 5,000 identified accident spots across the country.Underlining the need for generating awareness and education for the masses at large towards reducing or eliminating mortality on the roads of both human beings and animals, the minister said ecology and sustainability were most important for human lives.“India witnesses nearly five lakh road accidents every year, in which about 1.5 lakh lives are lost. It is our endeavour to bring down these figures by 20 to 25 per cent by the coming March 31,” Nitin Gadkari said.The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways had identified over 5,000 black spots, and the process for their rectification, including temporary and permanent measures, was being carried out on an urgent basis, he said.The Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) regarding the procedure for rectification of black spots for taking up short-term and long-term permanent measures have already been issued, as per the Ministry and to date, temporary measures on 1,739 newly-identified black spots and permanent measures on 840 newly identified black spots have already been taken.The Minister informed that various road safety measures had been highlighted to be focused upon on the stretches of the national highways.These steps are rectification of black spots, traffic calming measures, crash barriers, repairing, rehabilitation and reconstruction of dilapidated and narrow bridges, road safety audit, reduction of fatalities on vulnerable roads, highway patrolling and safety during construction.Gadkari also said his Ministry was also conscious about the need to protect animal lives on the roads and stressed that ethics, economy and ecology are the three most important pillars of the country.He said the Ministry had requested all agencies to follow the provisions of the manual titled “Eco-friendly measures to mitigate impacts of linear infrastructure on wildlife” issued by the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, for making a road or any linear infrastructure and take care of wildlife accordingly.He requested the NGOs and social organisations to locate black spots for animals on the roads, and inform his ministry so that necessary corrective action might be taken.The Ministry and its organisations are spending good amounts on creating infrastructure conducive to animal use.He cited the example of Nagpur-Jabalpur Highway, where via-ducts etc had been constructed for Rs 1,300 crore to create right-of-way for tigers.Similar exercises were being undertaken in the forest areas of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Uttarakhand (Dehradun), etc, he said.These include conducting studies for road engineering favourable to animal movement, constructing underpasses, elevated corridors, via-ducts, cut and cover, guard wall, fencing, watch tower, solar pumps, ponds for drinking water for animals, etc, the minister said.

Severe debility and weakness, in turn, resulted in the final collapse in water that led to drowning," it said.Also read: Kerala Cyber Warriors hack Maneka Gandhi's 'People for Animals' website for 'dragging pregnant elephant's death into politics'Drowning, followed by inhalation of water leading to lung failure was the immediate cause of death of the elephant, said the preliminary report prepared on May 28, a day after the elephant, estimated to be 15-year old, died in Velliyar River.No bullet, snare or any other metallic or foreign object found in any part of the carcass, the report said.The elephant is suspected to have consumed a pineapple filled with powerful firecrackers which exploded in the animal's mouth in the Silent Valley Forest.The incident triggered a social media storm with scores voicing concern over the cruelty meted out to the animal.The state forest department has said there was no conclusive evidence that the injury to the elephant's lower jaw was caused by a pineapple stuffed with crackers and it might be a possibility.The postmortem, performed at Thiruvizhamkunnu Forest Station under the Mannarkad forest division, revealed that the elephant was pregnant."Inside pelvic cavity enlarged uterus with a nearly two months foetus", it said.The report said extensive necrotic debris of several indistinguishable soft tissues, fully infested with maggots, were found inside the mouth.Also, distinct fracture and erosions of major portions of maxillary bones and medial portions of the body of the mandible (jaw bone) on both sides were noticed.Externally, apart from the swollen appearance of lower jaw and skin wounds, there was no other major wound or injury of significance on any other part of the body, it said.The elephant died in the Velliyar River with the incident triggering national outrage, prompting Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to assert that stern action would be taken against the culprits.Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar and BJP MP and former union minister Maneka Gandhi, among others, had voiced serious concern over the incident.One person was arrested on Friday in connection with the death of the elephant.

05-06-2020||New Delhi||Places of worship start prep to reopen, wait for Delhi govt's guidelines||A day after the Centre issued SOPs for the reopening of hotels, malls and religious locations, many prime places of worship here have started internal preparations to open their doors to devotees — from installing full-body sanitisation chambers to marking spots on the floors to ensure social distancing—during the coronavirus pandemic.However, the administrations of many such places of worship are waiting for the Delhi government's guidelines before taking final decisions on when to start receiving the faithful.Religious places within containment zones shall remain closed for public and the ones outside these zones will be allowed to open from June 8, according to the SOP issued by the Union Health Ministry on Thursday to contain the spread of COVID-19 at such venues. The Standard Operating Process (SOP) says it is important that social distancing and other preventive measures are followed strictly.While all the 14 ISKCON temples in Delhi will not be opened on June 8, they have, however, started preparations to follow the Centre's guidelines.  “On the basis of feedback we have got from our temples in other states and our discussion with other major temples in the capital, we have decided not to open ISKCON temples in Delhi on June 8. We will wait and watch and decide after a couple of days," Yudhishthir Govind Das, national communication director, ISKCON, told PTI.“We have installed full-body sanitisation chambers in the temple premises. We are also marking spots on the floors to ensure social distancing. There will be a time limit to sit in the temple, and we will abide by all the guidelines strictly whenever we open the temples," he said.The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee has also started sanitisation of all the Gurdwaras. However, they will wait for the Delhi government to issue guidelines before deciding when they will start receiving devotees again.“We have already started preparations and all the Gurdwaras are being sanitised. There would be maximum entry and exit gates. We will also ensure social distancing and install sanitisation stands. But we cannot go further till we get proper guidelines from Delhi government," Manjinder Singh Sirsa, President of DSGMC, told PTI.“I have been repeatedly asking for guidelines as it would be difficult for us to get ready at the last moment if there are any changes in the SOP issued by the Centre. Like whether sitting inside the premises would be allowed or not, if yes, what would be the time limit, what would be the opening and closing times, etc. We need to know details, otherwise, people would gather outside Gurdwaras on June 8," he said.Sirsa also suggested that there should not be any time limit to visit places of worship in order to avoid the rush of devotees.The Centre has empowered states to prohibit certain activities or put suitable restrictions if they deem it necessary for containment of the virus. Delhi is yet to issue guidelines but a senior Delhi government official has indicated that a decision will be taken on June 7.“Till now we have followed the centre's guidelines regarding lockdown. As far as unlock is concerned, the centre has given the flexibility to states. We will take a call on that on June 7," said the official.The Shahi Imam of Fatehpuri Masjid has been requesting people to avoid coming to the mosque for the next two-three months.“We will certainly follow the SOP but it would be better that people worship at home only for the next two-three months and avoid coming to mosques. Islam also says that first take care of your health," said Dr Mufti Mukarram Ahmed."Despite that, if people want to come, they should carry their own cap, soap, towel and drinking water. They should perform wazu (the ritual of washing hands before namaz) at home and spend minimum time at the mosque. For social distancing, we are making silver and green marks inside the mosque," he said.The Catholic Archdiocese of Delhi is waiting for clear guidelines from the Delhi government regarding community worship."It is not clear whether the SOP includes community worship or is it for individual prayers. We have holy masses in the church, like Sacred Heart Cathedral has six masses on Sundays and three on weekdays. So what are the guidelines regarding those," said Fr Savarimuthu Shankar, PRO of the organisation."There are around 50 Catholic churches in Delhi and all will follow these guidelines. We have to ensure that the virus does not spread from places of worship," he said.

05-06-2020||Vibha Sharma||IMD predicts another low-pressure area in Bay of Bengal on June 8||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 5Just a fortnight after cyclone ‘Amphan’ slammed the eastern coast of the country, a fresh “low-pressure area” is again taking shape in the Bay of Bengal.“The low-pressure area is likely to develop over east-central Bay of Bengal around June 8,” the IMD said on Friday, even as the remnants of the “severe” Cyclone ‘Nisarga’, which arrived over the western coastline in Mumbai two days ago, hover as a low-pressure area over the northeast Madhya Pradesh and its neighbourhood.Under its influence, light to moderate fairly widespread rain/thundershowers is “very likely over northeast Madhya Pradesh, east Uttar Pradesh and north Chhattisgarh” till June 6.  Isolated thunderstorm and lightning are also “very likely over these areas during the next 24 hours”.Super cyclone ‘Amphan’ and “severe” cyclone ‘Nisarga’ are both indicative of “above normal” sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Indian Ocean and also the trend of increased cyclonic activity in the pre-monsoon period in the Indian Ocean.The Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea have both been witnessing “above normal” cyclogenesis in the past two years, boosted by “anomalously warm ocean temperatures”.In the case of ‘Amphan’ as well as ‘Nisarga’, anomalously warm ocean temperatures were seen. While temperatures in the Bay of Bengal were between 30 to 33°C prior to ‘Amphan’, SSTs over the Arabian Sea was recorded 30 to 32°C.Experts say climate change is increasing the damage caused by cyclones such as ‘Nisarga’ and ‘Amphan’ in several ways.Higher SSTs make cyclones more powerful and increase rainfall during the storm. They increase sea levels which, in turn, increases the distance inland storm surges reach. It is the densely populated coastal cities such as Mumbai and Kolkata which will face the brunt due to the unplanned urban development with the destruction of mangroves acting as a buffer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/imd-predicts-another-low-pressure-area-in-bay-of-bengal-on-june-8-94956
05-06-2020||New Delhi||India may suffer devastating climate change impact in 80 years: Study||India may face devastating climate change effects, including killer heat waves and severe flooding, in the next 80 years, says a study that calls for urgent steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avert associated risks to the country’s population, ecosystems and economy.Annual mean temperatures across India are likely to increase by 4.2 degrees Celsius under a high emission scenario by the end of the 21st century, the researchers, led by Prof Mansour Almazroui from the King Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia, said.“India is the most densely populated region in the world, with relatively high sensitivity and low resilience to changes in its climate, all of which makes it very exposed and vulnerable to any changes that may occur during the rest of the 21st century,” Almazroui told PTI in an email on World Environment Day on Friday.“A large part of India’s population, ecosystems, and economy are all exposed to high risk in the face of future climate change,” he said.            The study, published in the journal Earth Systems and Environment last month, suggests that north-western India is at “particularly high risk” to flooding from snow and glacier melt caused by temperatures projected to rise by the end of the 21st century.The researchers also forecast killer heat waves over the plains, adding that severe flooding is likely to take place with annual rainfall over India projected to increase under all emission scenarios in the 21st century.Using a supercomputer to analyse global climate models, the research team observed a potentially large increase of more than 6 degrees Celsius under a high emission scenario over north-western India, comprising the complex Karakorum and Himalayan mountain ranges.“The enhanced warming is likely to further accelerate the snow and glacier melt over this region, with a consequent increase in flooding. This could have serious implications for crops, ecosystems, and populations living downstream,” Almazroui said.“Moreover, the rise in temperature is likely to increase the frequency of killer heat waves over the country’s plains,” he added.The study analysed the latest generation of models to project more warming -- 1 to 3 degrees Celsius—over the irrigated plains of the Ganges, which according to the researchers, may have serious repercussions for agriculture and livelihoods.The models project higher warming over the Indian subcontinent in the winter season than in the summer, which may disrupt snow or ice accumulations and affect winter cropping patterns, the researchers said.While the projected rise in the average temperature in winter is up to 4.7 degrees Celsius, the estimated warming for summers is up to 3.6 degrees Celsius, they said.The study also projected a higher increase in rainfall over north-western India, including Gujarat and Rajasthan, while the winter rainfall also shows a larger increase over Gujarat and adjacent states under all future scenarios.Under the high emission scenario, the summer monsoon rainfall averaged over India, particularly in the western side of the country that expands to Western Ghats and Kerala, is projected to increase by the end of the 21st century, the researchers said.The increase in summer rainfall, together with increased water in rivers due to glacier melt in summer, may cause severe summer flooding in the future, they said.

He, however, said 171 more trains were needed.After hearing the detailed arguments from advocates representing the Centre, states, Union Territories and others, the Bench said it would pronounce its verdict on June 9.During the hearing, it said all migrants, who wanted to go back home, should be sent within 15 days.Last month, it had taken ‘suo motu’ cognisance of migrant workers’ miseries and ordered the states to provide them free food, shelter and travel.On Friday, it suggested all migrants should be registered at block and district level and states should take care of them.“States will have to generate employment for them. They should facilitate their movement if they want to go back to other states for work,” it noted.The Maharashtra government counsel told the Bench that more than 11 lakh migrants went back home and only 38,000 were left now.The Delhi government counsel submitted that approximately four lakh migrant workers went back and only 10,000 remained.Senior advocate AM Singhvi said it was important to collate and publish data on the total number of migrants stranded, how many of them wanted to return home and the number of those already left while senior advocate Kapil Sibal talked about the minimum standards for food and water supplied to migrant workers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-denies-migrant-workers-died-of-hunger-lack-of-medication-94953
05-06-2020||New Delhi||Govt ‘clear and unapologetic’ about privatisation of PSUs: Principal Economic Adviser||The government is “clear and unapologetic” about the privatisation of the public sector enterprises as part of reforms, Principal Economic Adviser Sanjeev Sanyal said on Friday.Last month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced that there would be a maximum of four public sector companies in strategic sectors while state-owned firms in other segments would eventually be privatised.This would be part of a new coherent Public Sector Enterprises Policy to be formulated to push reforms in the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs), Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said while announcing the fifth and the last tranche of over Rs 20-lakh crore ‘Amtmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ package.Talking about the Centre’s privatisation drive, Sanyal said, “...we know that privatisation is difficult to do under these circumstances, but we want to be absolutely clear and unapologetic about what we want to do. All non-strategic PSUs (public sector undertakings) will be sold when we can do it. It’s not a lack of intent that will hold us back.”He further said the Essential Commodities Act was considered as the “holiest of holy law and it was one of the 10 commandments” but the government has now changed it.“Labour laws and others in 10 commandments, we are going to change it. We are changing it in a very peculiar way. We are actually going to tighten safety and working condition laws. We are actually introducing nationwide minimum wages. So it’s not entirely as some people may claim tilted against the labour,” he said.The government was open to various suggestions, including from the labour unions, to make the laws more robust, he said while addressing a virtual AIMA event.Earlier this week, the Union Cabinet approved an amendment to the six-a-and-half decade-old Essential Commodities Act to deregulate food items, including cereals, pulses and onion, a move that will transform the farm sector and help raise farmers’ income.The Cabinet also approved ‘The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020’ to ensure barrier-free trade in agriculture produce.The government also approved ‘The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, 2020’ to empower farmers to engage with processors, aggregators, wholesalers, large retailers and exporters.Asked about the steps to boost demand, Sanyal said the government was cognizant of the situation and as and when the need arose, resources would be utilised to support it.“I can assure you that we watch this very carefully and will be willing to use whatever space we have. As I said, we have some fiscal space, when we have quite a lot of monetary space. And there are other measures as well that can be thought of. We will do it when necessary,” he said.Citing an example, he said, a large pipeline of investment in infrastructure projects was planned for boosting demand and creating employment.“It is a good opportunity. As we lower the cost of capital and with global capital being as cheap as it is, there is a case for putting together a pipeline of large investment projects. So, there are ways of doing this. Demand is not only about reviving consumption. The investment is an important part of building the cycle,” he said.Under the privatisation policy, a list of strategic sectors will be notified where there will be at least one and a maximum of four public sector enterprises, apart from private sector companies.In other sectors, the CPSEs will be privatised depending upon the feasibility.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had last month said the government would announce a PSE policy as a self-reliant India needs a coherent policy. All sectors will be opened to private sectors also.The PSEs will continue to play an important role in defined areas. We need a coherent policy because sometimes you open up some sectors in piecemeal... Now we shall define the areas...where their presence will be impactfully felt,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said.The policy to privatise public sector companies is expected to give a boost to the government’s disinvestment programme.The Centre has set a budget target of Rs 2.10 lakh crore from disinvestment in the current fiscal, of which Rs 1.20 lakh crore is expected from the CPSE disinvestment.

Those found having symptoms such as fever would be immediately sent for quarantine, the officials said.A total of 3,000 special darshan tickets each priced at Rs 300 would be available online daily.The remaining 3,000 quotas would be set apart for free darshan and devotees opting for it can register themselves for the time slot at designated places here, including Alipiri at the foothills of Tirumala.The online ticket sales would commence from June 8.TTD has already announced it would conduct a trial run with its own staff, officials and some of the local public from June 8 to test the system ahead of the regular darshan.It had on March 20 barred entry of devotees into the temple for a week in the wake of the coronavirus scare and later extended it after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the nation-wide lockdown four days later.The Centre in its recent "Unlock 1" guidelines has allowed the opening of temples for public darshan among other relaxations.A temple official told PTI that during the lockdown so far, the over 2000-year old shrine incurred a loss of about Rs.500 crore revenue.

This cruel trade causes the suffering of millions of animals and endangers the health of people with pandemics like,” said Gajender K Sharma, Country Director World Animal Protection, India.“We can no longer ignore the fact that rampant trade of wild animals for the benefit of humans resulted in the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. And if we don’t act now, this won’t be the last pandemic. Wild animals belong in the wild. That is their natural habitat. We appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has been an advocate of animal welfare and wildlife preservation in the past, to support the global ban of wildlife trade at the G-20 summit,” he saidWildlife activists and environmentalists are demanding protection to thousands of species, who are at the risk of extinction due to human exploitation, ensuring wild animals have a home, preventing invasive species being introduced to new habitats and stopping extensive environmental pollution associated with the industrial farming of wildlife for commercial purposes, such as fur farms.Forest officials call the incident in Kerala a classic case of ‘man-animal conflict’.“No one would have fed the firecrackers-filled pineapple to the elephant.  It must have found it lying somewhere. Pineapples and other fruits filled with firecrackers are used as a snare to catch wild boars that destroy crops. It is cruel, wrong and illegal but such incidents do happen at places where wild animals create problems for farmers. The legal way to get rid of wild boars is long and tortuous,” the forest officials said.Incidentally, traps to snare wild boars/pigs are laid not only in Kerala but also Karnataka.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/environmental-groups-appeal-to-pm-modi-to-support-global-call-for-wildlife-trade-ban-94945
05-06-2020||New Delhi||Civil services preliminary exam on October 4: UPSC||The civil services preliminary examination 2020, postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, will be held on October 4, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) announced on Friday.It said the personality test of the candidates selected through the last year's civil services preliminary and main examinations will resume from July 20.This year's preliminary test was originally scheduled to be held on May 31, but was deferred due to the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus.Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh said the announcement of fresh date for the civil services preliminary exam would allay apprehensions in some quarters of it being cancelled."It would also allay apprehension from the minds of some quarters who thought that they would become overage by the next year in case the exam was postponed. Candidates need not worry. The examination will be held as per the UPSC's schedule," he told PTI.The civil services examination is conducted annually in three stages—prelims, main and interview—by the UPSC to select officers for the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) and the Indian Police Service (IPS), among others.Lakhs of aspirants take the examination every year to be part of the country's coveted civil services.The decision on announcement of fresh date was taken in a meeting held by the Commission to review the prevailing situation due to COVID-19 lockdown."Taking note of the opening of lockdown and progressive relaxations being announced by the Central government and various states, the Commission decided to issue a revised schedule of examination/recruitment tests," the UPSC said in a statement.According to the revised calendar, the civil services preliminary examination 2020 will be held on October 4 (Sunday). The main examination 2020 will begin from January 8, 2021 (Friday) for five days, it said."The dates of notification, commencement and duration of examinations/recruitment tests are liable to alteration, if the circumstances so warrant," the Commission said.Personality tests for civil services (main) examination, 2019, for remaining candidates are being resumed from July 20, it said, adding "candidates will be informed individually." A common examination for both NDA& NA Exam (I) and NDA&NA Exam (II), 2020 will be held on September 6, 2020, the UPSC said.The recruitment test for the posts of Enforcement Officer/Accounts Officer in the Employees' Provident Fund Organization (EPFO), earlier scheduled to be held on October 4, 2020, has been deferred, it said."New date for conduct of this recruitment test will be published on the website of the Commission at the time of issue of calendar of examinations/recruitment tests for 2021," the Commission added.

05-06-2020||New Delhi||Kerala Cyber Warriors hack Maneka Gandhi's 'People for Animals' website for 'dragging pregnant elephant's death into politics'||The official website of People for Animals (PFA), an animal rights NGO founded by BJP MP Maneka Gandhi, was hacked on Friday by a Facebook group called ‘Kerala Cyber Warriors’, which has called it an “operation against communal hatred”.Now, the website displays a long message by the hackers, along with a Google map of Ambalappara in Palakkad district, where a pregnant elephant had died. “Maneka Gandhi dragged the sad death of the pregnant elephant for dirty politics. Since you are an environmentalist and a ******* in geography. We are introducing Google Maps to your little brain,” reads the message on the website. Amid the furore over the tragic death of the pregnant elephant in Kerala, a major political blame game ensued after senior BJP leader and animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi called Malappuram, a district with a majority of Muslims, “India’s most violent district”.Also read: Wild elephant had major oral wounds; did not eat for nearly 2 weeks before drowning: Post-mortem reportThe BJP was accused of “communalising” and "using" the heartbreaking incident, the genesis of which, many says, is essentially man-animal conflict, for "political gains". Also read: Environmental groups appeal to PM Modi to support global call for wildlife trade banThe elephant died in Velliyar river, "which borders Palakkad and Malappuram districts", detractors said. Also, according to forest officials, no one would have fed the firecrackers-filled pineapple to the elephant. It must have found it lying somewhere. "Pineapples and other fruits filled with firecrackers are used as a snare to catch wild boars that destroy crops. It is cruel, wrong and illegal, but such incidents do happen at places where wild animals create problems for farmers. The legal way to get rid of wild boars is long and tortuous,” they said. Incidentally, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, who said killers will not be spared, named Kerala several times to assert it is “not an Indian culture to feed firecrackers and kill”. Maneka Gandhi’s statement was also used by BJP leaders to target the Pinarayi Vijayan government in the state where the party is trying to make inroads. “It is not an incident. It is a murder. A pregnant elephant was fed a pineapple filled with a bomb that exploded its mouth. Malappuram is very famous for incidents like this. It is the most violent district in the whole of India. For instance, they throw poison on roads so that 300-400 birds and dogs die at one time. Kerala Government has not taken any action in Malappuram,” Maneka Gandhi said on Thursday. According to the officials, “the issue is too complex and layered. ‘Gundu’, a firecracker used during celebrations, is often inserted in fruits to scare wild animals. There is also no evidence to suggest that the elephant was intentionally fed the explosive. Traps are laid to snare the wild boars/pigs not only in Kerala but also Karnataka."Farmers use the illegal way to get rid of wild animals because the legal way is long and tortuous,” they said. Originally belonging to Silent Valley National Park (SVNP) in Palakkad, the elephant died at Velliyar River with its trunk in the water. Due to the explosion, it received severe injuries to upper and lower jaws and the area filled with maggots. Because of the injuries the elephant could not eat or drink anything for weeks, as per reports.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-cyber-warriors-hack-maneka-gandhis-people-for-animals-website-for-dragging-pregnant-elephants-death-into-politics-94941
05-06-2020||New Delhi||SC asks if pvt hospitals ready to charge COVID-19 patients at Ayushman Bharat rate||The Supreme Court Friday asked private hospitals whether they are ready to provide treatment to COVID-19 infected patients at the charges prescribed under the government’s Ayushman Bharat Scheme.The ‘Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana’ is aimed at providing health cover to poor and vulnerable persons in the country.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde observed that the apex court is not asking all the private hospitals to treat certain number of COVID-19 patients for free. The bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, said it is asking only those private hospitals, which have been given land at concessional rates by the government, to treat certain number of coronavirus infected patients for free.“I just want to know if hospitals are ready to charge at Ayushman rates,” the CJI observed during the hearing which was conducted through video-conferencing. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that government is doing its best for the lowest strata of society, and people who cannot afford treatment are covered under the Ayushman Bharat scheme. The top court, which posted the matter for two weeks from now, was hearing a plea which has sought a direction for regulating the cost of treatment of COVID-19 at private hospitals across the country. During the arguments, the bench observed that there is an earlier judgment which said that hospitals, which have been given land on concessional rates, should treat certain number of patients for free.“Why cannot these hospitals treat a certain number of patients for free”, the bench observed, adding, “Please ensure they do some service”. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for a healthcare federation which has filed intervention application in the matter, said that hospitals which have received land on concessional rates are already complying with the requirements. Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared for an association of hospitals which has also sought to intervene in the matter, said that they are already complying with all the directions passed in the verdict, which was referred by the bench.Advocate Sachin Jain, who has filed the petition, told the bench that rates prescribed under the Ayushmann Bharat scheme should be made applicable to the hospitals. “The Union of India should stand with the citizens and not with corporate hospitals,” Jain said. “Is it your case that no hospital should make profit during this period?,” the bench asked the petitioner. Jain told the bench that he can show how Ayushmann Bharat scheme has been decided keeping in view the profitability of hospitals.Salve told the bench that Ayushman Bharat is a heavily discounted scheme and revenue of private hospitals has already gone down by around 60 per cent as footfall has decreased during the period of COVID-19.Rohatgi argued that no hospital is  making any profit during this period.“That is alright. You are making a sacrifice for a good cause,” the bench observed.  The advocates appearing for the hospital bodies said they would file their responses on the plea and also on issue raised in the matter.Meanwhile, the Centre has filed an affidavit in the matter and said that there is no provision under the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, 2010 “whereby it is mandated that the private hospitals running on the public land shall treat COVID-19 patients on free basis”.“It is again reiterated that such policies may only be defined and implemented by the respective state governments,” it said. The Centre further said that at present, private hospitals including charitable institutions are governed by the provisions of Clinical Establishments Act 2010.“It is submitted that apart from the said Act there is no separate provision or any other statutory provision which gives power to the Union of India to pass directions of the nature sought in the present petition to the charitable Institutions,” it said.The affidavit said, “It is therefore submitted that the Central Government, within its statutory powers or powers of delegated legislation, cannot make this particular bifurcation for the lack of a requisite statutory framework for the said classification”.It said that entire health infrastructure has been brought to most appropriate use for treatment of COVID-19 in the country and the Centre has taken several measures to strengthen public health facilities where medical care is provided free of cost to all patients.“The care cost in the private sector is not regulated by the Central Government,” the affidavit said. The top court had on May 27 asked the Centre to identify private hospitals where COVID-19 infected patients could get treatment for free or at a nominal cost. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-if-pvt-hospitals-ready-to-charge-covid-19-patients-at-ayushman-bharat-rate-94937
05-06-2020||Vibha Sharma||World Environment Day: Centre announces urban forest scheme||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 5On the World Environment Day, the government on Friday announced ‘Nagar Van’ scheme to develop 200 urban forests across the country in the next five years. The scheme will be implemented with people’s participation and collaboration between Forest Department, Municipal bodies, NGOs and corporates, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said.These forests will work as lungs of the cities and will primarily be on the forest land or any other vacant land offered by local urban local bodies, Javadekar said.Stressing on this year's theme for the day, “Time for Nature”, with special focus on biodiversity, Javadekar said “thumb rule is if we protect nature, nature protects us”. Highlighting India's contribution towards biodiversity, the minister said despite having many constraints like only 2.5% of the world's landmass, 16% of humans as well as cattle population, the country has nearly 8% of world's biodiversity.“India has 8% of world's biodiversity, despite having many constraint like only 2.5% of the world's landmass, has to carry 16% of human as well as cattle population and having only 4% of fresh water sources; the mega biodiversity that we have is the result of Indian ethos which is to be in sync with the nature,” he saidApart from beautification of urban environment, forests offer many benefits like impacting climate and the economy while providing shelter to wildlife and recreational area for city dwellers.According to the World Economic Forum, cities that have more trees are less noisy, with lower pollution levels.A fully-grown tree can annually absorb up to 150kg of carbon dioxide — one of the main greenhouse gases contributing to global warming. Trees can moderate temperatures in heavily built cities, where heat radiated from concrete on buildings and roads makes these areas hotter than the surrounding countryside, in a phenomenon known as ‘heat island’ effect, according to an official statement.As per Food and Agriculture Organisation, trees in urban areas reduce ozone, sulphur dioxide and particulate matter, remove large quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and release oxygen.In many countries there is a growing understanding of the importance of urban forests. Cities like Rio de Janeiro and Johannesburg have large forests within their urban areas. In India, most cities have gardens and parks, but not forests.An initiative that began in 2015-16 in Pune has now become a success story in urban area rejuvenation, the statement said quoting the example of Warje Urban Forest or Smriti Van.“Before becoming a pioneering urban forest, Warje Hill was a barren land under the Maharashtra Forest Department. As the city grew, it caused many encroachments by slums and builders.”"Four years ago, the Maharashtra Forest Department joined hands with TERRE Policy, a city based NGO, Tata Motors and Persistent Foundation to turn the barren hill into a green forest.To begin with, 8 feet saplings of variety of trees were planted. Four years down the line, Smriti Van has more than 6,500 fully grown trees, some 25-30 feet tall. "The forest is rich in biodiversity with 23 plant species, 29 bird species, 15 butterfly species, 10 reptiles and 3 mammal species. Five water ponds have been built and two watch towers constructed," it said.Javadekar said India is probably the only country where trees are worshipped, where animals, birds and reptiles are worshipped and this is the respect Indian society places for environment.“We had a very important tradition of village forest since ages, now this new scheme of urban forest will fill up the gap because urban areas have Gardens but very rarely forests. With this activity of creating urban forest we will also create additional carbon sink," he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/world-environment-day-centre-announces-urban-forest-scheme-94936
05-06-2020||New Delhi||Military standoff in Ladakh: India, China agree to handle 'differences' through talks||In the midst of their massive military standoff in eastern Ladakh, India and China on Friday vowed not allow their "differences" become disputes and agreed to handle them through talks while respecting each other's sensitivities, concerns and aspirations.The positive approach by the two countries in addressing strain in ties came at a video conference between Naveen Srivastava, Joint secretary (East Asia) in the external affairs ministry and Wu Jianghao, director general in China's foreign ministry.The talks came a day ahead of Lieutenant General-level dialogue between Indian and Chinese armies to resolve the month-long standoff in eastern Ladakh.Without directly referring to the military standoff, the External Affairs Ministry said the two sides reviewed the state of bilateral relations including the "current developments". "In this context they recalled the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, that peaceful, stable and balanced relations between India and China will be a positive factor for stability in the current global situation," the MEA said in a statement.It further said: "Both sides agreed that in accordance with the guidance provided by the leadership, the two sides should handle their differences through peaceful discussion bearing in mind the importance of respecting each other's sensitivities, concerns and aspirations and not allow them to become disputes." The MEA said two sides agreed to settle differences in accordance with guidance provided by leadership of two countries, in a reference to decisions taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in their first informal summit in Chinese port city of Wuhan in 2018.In Beijing, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the two countries should not pose a "threat" to each other and not let their differences turn into disputes while underlining the need for managing differences properly.The MEA said the two sides also exchanged views on the challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and cooperation in various multilateral forums.The Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a bitter military standoff in at least four sensitive areas in Eastern Ladakh following an incident  of violent clashes between then in Pangong Tso on May 5 and 6. The two sides resorted to massive build up and have been on an eyeball-to-eyeball situation in Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldi.On Saturday's military talks, official sources said the Indian delegation will press for restoration of status quo ante all areas of eastern Ladakh, oppose huge build up of Chinese troops in the region and ask China not to resist infrastructure development by India on its side of the de-facto border.The Indian delegation will be led by Lt General Harinder Singh, the general officer commanding of Leh-based 14 Corps, while the Chinese side will be headed by the Commander of the Tibet Military District, they said. In their first informal summit in 2018, Modi and Xi had decided to issue "strategic guidance" to their militaries to strengthen communication and build trust and understanding between the border guarding forces of the two countries. The summit had taken place months after Indian and Chinese troops were locked in a 73-day-long standoff in Doklam. When asked about the Lt General-level dialogue, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman told a media briefing in Beijing: "We have full-fledged border-related mechanisms and we maintain close communications though military and diplomatic channels."  The sources said India was not expecting any "concrete outcome" from the meeting, but considers it important as the high-level military dialogue could pave the way for a negotiated settlement of the tense standoff.After the standoff began in early last month, Indian military leadership decided that Indian troops will adopt a firm approach in dealing with the aggressive posturing by the Chinese troops in all disputed areas of Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie.The Chinese army is learnt to have deployed around 2,500 troops in Pangong Tso and Galwan Valley besides gradually enhancing temporary infrastructure and weaponry.The sources said satellite images have captured significant ramping up of defence infrastructure by China on its side of the LAC, the de-facto border, including by upgrading a military airbase around 180 km from the Pangong Tso area.The Chinese Army has been gradually ramping up its strategic reserves in its rear bases near the the LAC by rushing in artillery guns, infantry combat vehicles and heavy military equipment, the sources said.China has also enhanced its presence in certain areas along the Line of Actual Control in Northern Sikkim and Uttarakhand following which India has also been its presence by sending additional troops, they said.Meanwhile, sources said the intelligence agencies have submitted a detailed to the government on the overall situation in eastern Ladakh and how Chinese military has increasingly strengthened its positions in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Daulat Beg Oldie and Demchok.The trigger for the face-off was China's stiff opposition to India laying a key road in the Finger area around the Pangong Tso Lake besides construction of another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley.  The road in the Finger area in Pangong Tso is considered crucial for India to carry out patrol. India has already decided not to stall any border infrastructure projects in eastern Ladakh in view of Chinese protests.Government sources said military reinforcements including troops, vehicles and artillery guns were sent to eastern Ladakh by the Indian Army to shore up its presence in the areas where Chinese soldiers were resorting to aggressive posturing. The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it. Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

05-06-2020||New Delhi||Yamuna river regains sparkle as virus lockdown banishes waste||The sparkle has returned to the Yamuna river flowing through India's capital of New Delhi, residents say, after decades of filthy and stinking waters, matted with garbage and polluted with toxic effluent from industry.In a feat that eluded years of government cleanliness efforts, a nationwide lockdown against the coronavirus has brought about the transformation of a river many Hindus consider holy, with a halt in industrial activity since late in March.Sanjay Gir, a 55-year-old Hindu monk who spends his time on the riverbank, said he could not remember when he had last seen the river so clean."Ever since the lockdown, we can take Mother Yamuna's water in our hands and offer it for prayer, as well as drink it," said the beared Gir, clad in traditional white dhoti."Because everything is closed right now - all the factories, industries are shut...their waste is not coming into the river." From its source among Himalayan peaks, the river meanders 1,376 km (855 miles) through a clutch of northern states to join the river Ganges in the city of Allahabad, where Hindu tradition says the two merge with a third, the mythical Saraswati.One of the world's toughest lockdowns against the coronavirus, which has caused nearly 217,000 infections and more than 6,000 deaths in India, kept out most of the industrial waste that normally clogs the Yamuna.That was the key reason for the better water quality, said Anshuman Jaiswal of city research body the Energy and Resources Institute."The industrial discharge which was going into the Yamuna actually stopped and that, for sure, has reduced the pollution load," he added.But the waters will deteriorate again, Jaiswal warned, as the lockdown lifts and industries re-open.Nevertheless, while it lasts, a clean, revitalised Yamuna also augurs well for the environmental condition of the Taj Mahal, India's famed monument to love that stands on the riverbank in the northern city of Agra.

He said there should be an upper limit of the treatment cost, else most of the patients can't avail of Covid-19 treatment.A similar petition was also pending before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde which had asked Centre to spell out if private/charitable hospitals running on land provided to them free or on concessional rates could be asked to treat Covid-19 patients free of cost.The Centre had said it didn't have statutory power to direct private hospitals to provide free treatment to patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-pil-seeks-cap-on-treatment-cost-charged-by-private-hospitals-94918

There are more accused in the case and efforts are on to nab them," Kerala Forest Minister K Raju told reporters.Forest and police officials are conducting a joint probe into the elephant’s death and a ‘very fruitful investigation’ is going on, he said.The Kerala Forest Department in a tweet said: “KFD has zeroed in on the culprits and recorded the first arrest in the wild elephant death case”.The incident had triggered a national outrage, with Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar and BJP MP and former union minister Maneka Gandhi, among others, reacting to it.Forest department sources had said yesterday that three people were under the scanner of the joint investigation team of their personnel and Kerala police and a search was on for two more people.The department had said that there was no conclusive evidence that the injury to the elephant’s lower jaw was caused by a pineapple stuffed with crackers and “it might be a possibility.”The 15-year-old elephant is suspected to have consumed a pineapple filled with powerful fire crackers which exploded in its mouth in the Silent Valley forest.It died in the Velliyar River a week later on May 27.The pachyderm’s tragic end came to light after a forest officer posted an emotional note on his Facebook page, narrating it. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/elephant-killing-one-arrested-efforts-on-to-nab-more-accused-says-forest-minister-94905
05-06-2020||Chandigarh||Veterinary scientists explore alternative strategy for developing drugs against COVID-19||Joining the fight against COIVD-19 pandemic, veterinary scientists at the National Centre for Veterinary Type Cultures (NCVTC) are exploring alternative strategies to develop drugs against the deadly virus.They will screen their library of 94 small molecule chemical inhibitors for anti-virals against various strains of coronaviruses.The molecules are known to inhibit cellular kinases, phosphatases, and epigenetic regulators.The targets of these inhibitors are well characterised in cancer, but their role in the virus life cycle is not yet known. The selected candidates with anti-coronavirus activity will be subjected to study their molecular mechanism of action, besides examining the generation of potential drug-resistant virus variants."Chemical library screening in medicinal chemistry research is a useful methodology that considerably shortens drug discovery and development cycle, especially for newly identified etiologic agents, such as SARS-Cov-2,” said Prof Sandeep Verma, Secretary, SERB.“Such an approach provides rapid access to useful pharmacophores and narrows down the search for preferred molecular scaffolds and is also compatible with high-throughput robotic assays. While supporting CoV-2 vaccine development programs, it is also imperative to have sufficient focus toward anti-coronavirus drug discovery pipeline," he added.The study has been approved by the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB). Based at Hisar, NCVTC functions under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.It is a microbial repository responsible for the conservation of microbes where microbial biodiversity of animal origin is being conserved so that it can be utilized effectively for research, teaching and development of biologicals for improving livestock and human health.According to the Ministry of Science and Technology, antiviral drugs are developed by directly targeting certain viral proteins.However, this strategy often fails due to the rapid generation of drug-resistant viruses. Unlike higher organisms, a viral polymerase—the viral enzyme that synthesizes its nucleic acid (RNA)—does not have proofreading capacity.The RNA viruses such as the coronaviruses do not have the mechanisms to remove wrongly incorporated nucleotides (building blocks of viral RNA) during the synthesis of the viral genome.The lack of proofreading capacity results in the accumulation of point mutations in the viral genome. This leads to changes in viral proteins. The altered viral proteins may then become resistant to the available antiviral drugs.This intriguing ability of the viruses to rapidly and frequently change themselves is a big challenge for the scientists in developing anti-viral drugs.Viruses can only replicate inside the host cell. A host (human) cell contains around 25,000 proteins. During replication, viruses establish numerous interactions with these cellular proteins. A virus needs more than 1,000 different cellular proteins to replicate inside the host cell effectively.Dr Naveen Kuman, the scientist at NCVTC, is exploring an alternate strategy to target such cellular proteins, protein-protein (virus-host) interaction and epigenetic regulators for anti-viral drug development commonly called as host-directed antiviral therapy.These anti-virals are believed to have fewer tendencies in inducing drug resistance because it is not possible for the virus to easily change missing cellular functions by mutations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/veterinary-scientists-explore-alternative-strategy-for-developing-drugs-against-covid-19-94904
05-06-2020||June 5||What you need to know about the coronavirus right now||Here's what you need to know about the coronavirus right now:When coronavirus and protests collideAustralian authorities are taking legal action to try and stop a Black Lives Matter protest scheduled for Saturday in Sydney, citing the risk of an outbreak of COVID-19 given the thousands expected to attend. State police had originally approved the protest on the understanding that there would be fewer than 500 participants.Prime Minister Scott Morrison had earlier on Friday told people not to attend the gathering and similar rallies in Melbourne and other cities.His warnings joined those of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Robert Redfield, who urged participants in protests sweeping the United States since the death of George Floyd to get tested for coronavirus.Hydroxychloroquine or not?Scientists are resuming COVID-19 trials of the now world-famous drug hydroxychloroquine, as confusion persists about the anti-malarial hailed by U.S. President Donald Trump as a potential "game-changer" in fighting the pandemic.The World Health Organization (WHO), which last week paused trials when the Lancet in a study showed the drug was tied to an increased risk of death in hospitalised patients, said on Wednesday it was ready to resume trials.But the jury is still out, according to Martin Landray, co-lead scientist on the Recovery trial, the world's largest research project into existing drugs that might be repurposed to treat COVID-19 patients. "People can quote data, people can quote experts, but there is continuing huge uncertainty," he said.Breakthrough generosityThe GAVI vaccines alliance said it had raised $567 million towards an initial goal of $2 billion from international donors for an Advanced Market Commitment to buy future COVID-19 vaccines for poor countries.The deal would help secure enough COVID-19 vaccine doses - when the shots have been developed - for poor countries to immunise healthcare workers and those at high risk, it said, as well as creating a "buffer of doses" for use when needed."To beat the COVID-19 pandemic, the world needs more than breakthrough science. It needs breakthrough generosity," Bill Gates, co-chair of the philanthropic Gates Foundation, told the summit.GAVI is a public-private partnership backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the WHO, the World Bank, UNICEF and others.Contact-tracing wearableSingapore plans to soon launch a wearable device for novel coronavirus contact tracing that, if successful, it will distribute to all of its 5.7 million residents, the government said on Friday.The city-state has already developed the first-of-its-kind smartphone app to identify and alert people who have interacted with novel coronavirus carriers, but the bluetooth technology has been beset with glitches and the app is not widely used.The device being developed can be worn on a lanyard or kept in a handbag and will be battery-operated, foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan said last month in an interview with Sky News Australia. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-right-now-94900

It needs a thorough probe," said the official who received a complaint about the teacher in March.According to the records in all schools, she was on the rolls of these schools for over a year.KGBV is a residential school for girls from weaker sections and teachers are appointed on contract. They are paid around Rs 30,000 a month. Each block in a district has one Kasturba Gandhi School.She has allegedly taken home Rs 1 crore as salary from these schools over 13 months till February 2020.A native of Mainpuri, she was last found working in Rae Bareli's KGBV till February, when her forgery came to light.The basic education officer in Rae Bareli, Anand Prakash, said the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan office had issued a letter to six districts to check about her."Though Rae Bareli was not named in the list, we did cross-check and found the woman working at our KGBV also. A notice was issued to her but she did not report back. Her salary was immediately stopped," he said.He said that due to the lockdown, the inquiry could not proceed but now records would be verified. It is yet to be ascertained if she was using the same bank account for salaries drawn from different schools. IANSNothing confirmed so far, probe on; says UP govtLucknow: After the reports in the media about the teacher, the Uttar Pradesh government on Friday said a probe is on and "nothing has been confirmed so far"."Acting on media reports, the Additional Director, Basic Education, was ordered to probe the matter. Nothing has been confirmed so far. The name of a teacher has come to light, she is absconding now. It is being said that Rs 1 crore was paid as salary. This is not at all true. No such thing has been confirmed," Director General School Education Vijay Kiran Anand told PTI."A probe is on and if allegations are found to be true, an FIR would be lodged. The transfer of money (salary) in her bank account has also not been done. Divisional officers are investigating the matter. Strict action will be taken if any teacher is found to be working as a proxy teacher in other schools," the officer said.

India is no stranger to USTR investigations, having been probed several times on various grounds.“President Trump is concerned that many of our trading partners are adopting tax schemes designed to unfairly target our companies. We are prepared to take all appropriate action to defend our businesses and workers against any such discrimination,” said USTR Robert Lighthizer in a statement.Four years ago, India levied 6 per cent tax on for advertisements hosted on off-shore businesses like mobile phone apps, social media platforms and digital content streaming services. This was fine with the USTR. But it has opposed the latest Union Budget expanding the scope of the equalisation levy (tax) to revenues generated by non-resident e-commerce firms operating in India.

Their resignations were accepted by the Speaker and the two seats declared vacant further reducing the strength of the 182-member House to 173 with nine seats vacant.Five Congress members had resigned from the House on the eve of the RS elections in March which were postponed due to the lockdown.Considering the strength of the respective parties in the Assembly, the BJP was almost assured of winning three seats and the Congress, which till March was comfortably placed to win two seats, may now have to be satisfied with only one seat.Even if the Congress managed to stall its further downhill slide as the party think-tank was planning, the party now with 66 seats and assured support of one Independent would still fall short of three first preference votes to clinch two seats.Alarmed, the Congress convened a meeting of its MLAs in Gandhinagar this afternoon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-rajya-sabha-poll-two-gujarat-cong-mlas-resign-94588

It will be under-girded by an agreement to share logistics, giving the armed forces of both countries easier access to each other's military bases. India already has one such agreement with the US and is planning to sign another with Japan. The pact will widen the arc of operations for India, specially its maritime surveillance planes - the Boeing P8I- whose close variant is also used by Australia. This would mean, that a surveillance plane, if flying in the far east, dopes not need to rely on just US bases for refuel/ spare parts.To propel this security relationship further, the Foreign and Defence Ministers will meet in a '2+2' format to discuss strategic issues at least once every two years.The Modi-Morrison interaction provided a glimpse of the extended relationship with Asian countries, including trilaterals with Japan and Indonesia, respectively, seven-country consultations on Covid with Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Vietnam and a quadrilateral with the US.

05-06-2020||New Delhi||Cases soar; Bajaj calls lockdown ‘draconian’||On a day when India’s Covid-19 load saw a record daily surge of 9,304 cases, industrialist Rajiv Bajaj assailed the Centre over the manner in which the lockdown had been imposed, calling it “draconian”.In a video conversation with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the MD of Bajaj Auto said the lockdown ensured India “flattened the GDP curve instead of the Covid curve and got the worst of both worlds”.He said the lockdown was more along the lines of the western nations than the eastern ones such as Japan and Singapore, which settled for softer versions of the shutdown to let parts of their economies function.Bajaj also noted that reopening the economy was tough and Prime Minister Narendra Modi would have to use a “clear narrative” to inspire confidence in the people and bring them out of fear.Meanwhile, the disease load rose to 2,16,919 with 1,04,106 recoveries and 6,075 deaths today, while the recovery rate was 47.99 per cent and fatality rate 2.8 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cases-soar-bajaj-calls-lockdown-draconian-94558
05-06-2020||New Delhi||Can’t coerce firms to pay full wages, says apex court||The Supreme Court today said no coercive action can be taken against employers for violating the March 29 notification of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) mandating payment of full wages to employees during the lockdown.MHA notificationAn MHA notification mandated payment of full wages to staff during lockdownThe govt said this aimed at averting mass migration by workersPetitioners say the Disaster Management Act cannot impinge upon provisions of the Industrial Disputes ActThe Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan passed an interim order after the Centre submitted that the MHA notification was a temporary measure for 54 days.The court reserved its order on a batch of petitions challenging the validity of the MHA notification for June 12.The petitioners, including Karnataka-based company Ficus Pax and Ludhiana Hand Tools Manufacturers Association, have challenged the validity of Section 10(2)(i) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.The provisions of this Act cannot “impinge upon express provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and take away the right to layoff workmen during times of natural calamity,” they said.Terming the MHA order under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, as arbitrary, they said the order violated the private companies’ right to carry on any occupation, trade or business guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. Attorney General KK Venugopal said the notification aimed at averting mass migration by workers and preventing human suffering.“But your notification compelled payment of 100 per cent of salaries... it can be around 50 to 75 per cent. So the question is, do you have the power to get them to pay 100 per cent, and on their failure to do so, prosecute them?” the Bench sought to know. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-coerce-firms-to-pay-full-wages-says-apex-court-94560
05-06-2020||New Delhi||We will investigate Kerala jumbo’s death: Javadekar||Amid furore over the tragic death of a pregnant elephant in Kerala, a political blame game has also ensued after senior BJP leader and animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi termed Malappuram, a district with Muslim majority, “India’s most violent district”.Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar tweeted, “This is not an Indian culture to feed crackers and kill. We will not leave any stone unturned to investigate properly and nab the culprit(s).”The BJP is now being accused of “communalising” and using the incident, the genesis of which, many say, is essentially man-animal conflict, for “political gains”.The elephant died in Velliyar river, which borders Palakkad and Malappuram districts, its detractors say.Meanwhile, according to forest officials, no one would have fed firecracker-filled pineapple to the elephant. It must have found it lying somewhere. “Pineapples and other fruits filled with firecrackers are used as a snare to catch wild boars that destroy crops. It is cruel, wrong and illegal but such incidents do happen at places where wild animals create problems for farmers. The legal way to get rid of wild boars is long and tortuous,” they say.Several BJP leaders used Maneka Gandhi’s statement to target Pinarayi Vijayan-led government in Kerala where the party is trying to make inroads. “It is a murder. Malappuram is very famous for incidents like this. It is the most violent district in the whole of India. For instance, they throw poison on roads so that 300-400 birds and dogs die at one time. Kerala Government has not taken any action in Malappuram,” Maneka Gandhi said.Vijayan said an investigation was under way and the state government would take strict action against the culprits.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-will-investigate-kerala-jumbos-death-javadekar-94616
