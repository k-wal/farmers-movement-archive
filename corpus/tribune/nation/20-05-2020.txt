20-05-2020||Lucknow/Jaipur/New Delhi||Cong buses for migrants turn back from inter-state border; UP unit chief rearrested||Hundreds of buses massed by the Congress on the Rajasthan-Uttar Pradesh for migrant workers turned back Wednesday evening, signalling an end to the party’s standoff with the UP government that also led to the arrest of its state unit president.In a video message, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the party is taking back the 1,000 buses it had arranged if the Uttar Pradesh government didn’t want to use them to help stranded migrant workers return home.Vadra said the buses will remain at the UP border till 4 pm, when it would be 24 hours since they were brought there.“If you don’t want to use them, it doesn’t matter. We shall send them back,” she said, adding that the party had turned back some buses a few days earlier as well.Her message was put out minutes before the 4 pm deadline given Tuesday night.An hour and a half later, a police official in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur district said the buses had started returning from the border.In Lucknow, UP Congress spokesperson Lallan Kumar confirmed this later.Congress workers held a dharna at the party’s Uttar Pradesh headquarters, displaying banners and placards, over the denial of permission for the buses by the state’s BJP government.Lallan Kumar said similar dharnas were held at party offices in other districts.They were also protesting over the arrest, initially on Tuesday evening, of UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu.Lallu was arrested in Agra for violating lockdown rules when he led a protest over the buses being stopped at the Rajasthan-UP border.An Agra court granted him bail on Wednesday. But the party said he was later rearrested in connection with another FIR registered at a Lucknow police station.Lallu and Priyanka Gandhi’s personal secretary Sande Singh are charged with cheating and forging documents in the Lucknow FIR registered on Tuesday.The UP government claimed the list submitted by the Congress contained unsafe buses and registration numbers of vehicles like autorickshaws, cars and trucks.Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma repeated the allegations on Wednesday, while calling the Congress offer to send buses a “political stunt”.He said about 460 buses mentioned in the Congress list of 1,049 buses were “fake”, implying that the state government could not make use of them.He said 297 of the buses were “junk”, an apparent reference to the government claim that they lacked either insurance papers or fitness certificates. Ninety-eight vehicles in the list submitted to the state government by the Congress are cars, ambulances and three-wheelers, he said.“Should we run the unfit buses and put the lives of the migrant labourers at risk?” he said.Sharma claimed that the buses belonged to roadways corporation of Rajasthan, where the Congress is in power. “How can the resources of a state government be utilised by a political party?” he said.Before appearing to call off the standoff, Priyanka Gandhi urged the Yogi Adityanath government to make use of the buses, saying it could put BJP banners on them if it wanted.Addressing migrant workers, she said the party will stand by them. “We will help you to the best of our ability.” Apart from the buses at the UP-Rajasthan border, the Congress also brought 200 buses to Noida, another gateway to the state.Police said they were turned away as they did not carry permits to enter Uttar Pradesh.Congress leader Rajiv Shukla, present there, was also asked to go back to Delhi, Gautam Buddh Nagar police said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-buses-for-migrants-turn-back-from-inter-state-border-up-unit-chief-rearrested-87505

The app has falsely claiming calls are end-to-end encrypted when they are not,” Chugh submitted.The petitioner demanded that it should be banned in India as well until an appropriate law was put in place.Continued use of Zoom was “making the users vulnerable and prone to cyber threats”, Chugh said seeking a direction to the Centre to carry out an exhaustive technical study into the security and privacy risks involved.It posed a security threat and could lead in increase in cyber crimes in India.Noting that COVID-19 pandemic drastically reshaped the way in which consumers, businesses and schools communicated, Chugh said instead of lending a helping hand to people in need, Zoom violated the privacy of its millions of users by misusing and exploiting their personal information.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-supreme-court-seeks-ban-on-zoom-app-87503

We have eased some restrictions. But in coming days we need to have stringent restrictions at certain regions. As Keralites from abroad and other states have started reaching the state, the number of patients is rising,” Vijayan said.Incidentally, his warning came on a day when public transport—state-run KSRTC buses, autorickshaws and taxis—were back on the roads in the state as the Left Front government eased COVID-19 lockdown norms after 54 days.Of the 24 positive cases, all but one are returnees---12 from abroad and 11 from other states, including eight from Maharashtra where over 39,000 coronavirus cases have been registered.Besides, three others were from neighbouring Tamil Nadu, where the cumulative tally was over 12,000.One person from Kannur had been infected through contact, the Chief Minister said.The active cases stood at 161 with five being discharged from hospitals, ending a drought of recoveries during the last three days.On Wednesday, Palakkad reported seven cases, Malappuram four and Kannur three, Pathnamthitta, Thiruvananthapuram and Thrissur reported two each.Kasaragod, Kozhikode, Alappuzha and Ernakulam recorded a solitary case each.The remaining examinations of Class 10 and 12, postponed due to the lockdown, would be conducted from May 26-30 as decided earlier, Vijayan said.“The decision was taken after the Centre’s nod. The exams will take place from May 26. Necessary arrangements including transportation for children will be ensured. We will make sure that everyone will have the chance to write the exams”, he said.The Centre has asked the state to conduct the examinations after taking necessary precautions, including locating the centres outside containment zones.Urging people coming to Kerala from other states and abroad to strictly follow the quarantine norms for the prescribed number of days, Vijayan said it was necessary to keep the virus at bay.Those under observation must remain under ‘room quarantine’ and must not come into contact with the family members.Only one family member should interact with the person under quarantine for the stipulated number of days, he said.The state government has till now created 6,700 temporary posts in the health department, the Chief Minister said, adding this included the recently created 2,948 posts to tackle COVID-19 situation.The newly appointed staff would be deployed in various first-line care centres, Covid care centres and COVID hospitals.At least 3,396 incidents of people not wearing masks had been reported on Wednesday and cases were registered against 12 people for violating the quarantine protocol, he added.

20-05-2020||---||India hits out at Nepal, says artificial enlargement of territorial claims not acceptable||New Delhi, May 20India on Wednesday hit out at Nepal for releasing a new political map that includes Kalapani, a bone of contention between the two countries, as well as other disputed spots.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said Kathmandu's release of a revised official map of Nepal that includes parts of Indian territory was a “unilateral act and not based on historical facts and evidence”.Accusing Nepal of going contrary to the bilateral understanding to resolve the outstanding boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue, MEA official spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said India would not accept such artificial enlargement of territorial claims.The dispute over Kalapani had been brewing since late last year when India reacted in measured tones. It reared again when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced the black-topping of a road leading to a pass with China through a triangle that Nepal says is its territory.India had offered to hold Foreign Secretary level talks once the pandemic was over, but influential members of Nepalese Parliament, which is in session, set the tone for a hardening of stance by pointing out if the Indian Defence Minister inaugurated a road during a pandemic, the talks could also take place now.The MEA further said the Nepal Government was well aware of India’s position on this matter and urged it to refrain from “such unjustified cartographic assertion and respect India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.It hoped the Nepalese leadership will create a positive atmosphere for diplomatic dialogue to resolve the outstanding boundary issues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-hits-out-at-nepal-says-artificial-enlargement-of-territorial-claims-not-acceptable-87498

The two factors actively contributed to Amphan gaining strength while it made its way up in the Bay of Bengal. SSTs remained high till the time it reached northern parts of the Bay,” he said.Incidentally, low pressure areas have been forming in the region since the beginning of May.Cyclone Fani last year and Phailin (the most intense cyclone after the 1999 Odisha ‘Super Cyclone’) in 2013 were also classified as ‘Extremely Severe’ cyclones. Experts are relating Amphan’s high intensity to global warming and abnormally warm SSTs in the Indian Ocean. Just like a rocket is powered by hydrogen and oxygen, cyclones/hurricanes are powered by water vapour. More global heating means more water vapour and more power to the cyclones. Indian Ocean is warm ocean. Water is the first and perhaps the key ingredient for the formation of tropical cyclones, they say.‘Super Cyclone’ is the highest category of tropical storms, beginning with a ‘Depression’, ‘Cyclone/Deep Depression’, ‘Severe Cyclone’, ‘Very Severe Cyclone’ and ‘Extremely Severe Cyclone’. Hot-dry weather in NorthwestDrawing all moisture towards it, Amphan has also impacted the weather over Northwest in a way. The prevailing hot and dry weather in the region is due to the absence of easterly winds, Palawat said, predicting that heat wave like conditions to develop over the region “soon”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/super-cyclone-to-calm-down-as-depression-by-thursday-87497

It requires collaboration, not coercion.”In India, the health minister said, the government swung into action and added capacity in terms of infrastructure as well as manpower. With a fleet of 10,000 dedicated COVID hospitals and Care Centres and a trained healthcare workforce of over two million, there was no looking back, he said, adding that India took every possible step to ensure that it contains the spread of the virus.“We also ensured that focus on COVID-19 should not mean neglect of patients of other diseases,” he stressed.Along with taking care of its citizens, India also extended help to other countries, Vardhan said, adding that it has promoted coordination to counter coronavirus and organized capacity building by sharing its medical expertise with the neighbouring countries. “India is living up to its reputation as the pharmacy of the world, especially for affordable medicines,” he said.Vardhan said besides meeting the domestic needs, India has provided medical supplies to over 123 partner countries, including 59 members of NAM. The country is also taking active part in the global efforts to develop remedies and vaccines, he said. “As developing countries, it is our people that stand to be the most profoundly affected by these changes. We must all realise that our destinies are linked like never before,” he said, seeking constructive deliberations, cooperation and collaboration in the spirit of solidarity and fraternity that characterizes NAM.Acknowledging the contribution of the frontline workers, Vardhan said, “Let us all stand up to clap for all frontline COVID warriors - our doctors, our nurses, our paramedics, our sanitation and security staff, our army, police and paramilitary forces, our journalists, all those who are putting their lives at risk for us, and for their families who are sending their members to the battlefield with all the risks. “They have taught us a lesson, and that lesson is to never forget that human welfare must be the basis of all economic growth,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/micro-identification-isolation-prevented%C2%A0large-scale-death-spread-of-covid-19-vardhan-87494

Consequently, the custody of the sister of the petitioner is without authority of law, and illegal,” the plea contended.           The plea sought direction to the authorities to produce the woman before the high court and to satisfy the court that her custody was not illegal. It also sought her release from the jail. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-seeks-delhi-polices-reply-on-plea-claiming-womans-custody-under-uapa-as-illegal-87485

While the all-India testing average was 1,025 per million population, the figure for Telangana was only 546.”She further pointed out that the state was not using the capacities of the labs optimally.Telangana Health Minister Etela Rajender dismissed the Centre’s concerns, but Congress state president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said his party had been repeatedly pointing out the lapses and the government was hushing up the factual situation on ground.Not willing to miss an opportunity to score some brownie points, BJP state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar said his party had always expressed doubts over the government’s understanding and approach to the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-expresses-concern-over-telanganas-low-rate-of-testing-87484

Around 1,200 DTC buses will be operating on Wednesday for the movement of migrants, Gahlot said.                 There are around 6,500 public transport buses, including 3,900 run by the DTC and over 2,500 cluster buses operated by the Delhi Integrated Multimodal Transit System (DIMTS).Gahlot said more cluster buses are on the roads on Wednesday as the drivers who were stuck in Uttar Pradesh or Haryana have reached Delhi.He said the cooperation of people is key to maintaining social distancing in the buses and other modes of transport in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.“People must ensure that they do not violate the rules in auto-rickshaws, buses or two-wheelers. If such violation takes place, action will be taken,” the minister said.The Delhi Government is also working on a standard operating procedure (SOP) for public transportation. In view of the coronavirus spread, thermal screening at some key terminals and bus stops has been started and the government has ordered for more devices to cover other busy bus stops.

It has also asked India to open talks with the Taliban considering that it will soon be a part of the governing structure in Kabul.“The border dispute is a reminder that Chinese aggression is not always just rhetorical. So whether it is in South China Sea or whether it is along the border with India, we continue to see provocations and disturbing behaviour by China that raises questions how it seeks to use its growing power,’’ said Alice G Wells, US State Department’s top official for Central and South Asia.This aggressive Chinese behaviour has led to a rallying of like-minded nations in the ASEAN or of US-led diplomatic groupings such as the trilateral with Japan and India or the quadrilateral that includes Australia, said Wells in her strongest backing of India in the land border dispute with China.Accusing China of being extremely self-centered, Wells said this has led to conversations around the world about reinforcing the post-World War II principles of free and open trade that will help lift all boats “including the Chinese boat”.“We want to see it an international system that provides benefit to everyone and not a system where there is suzerainty to China. In this instance the border disputes are a reminder of the threat posed by China,” she said in a webinar with journalists of the region.Wells also had harsh words to say about China with respect to Nepal and Pakistan. Calling upon Nepal to accept a $ 500 million US loan to improve roads and electricity transmission, she said this would show that Nepal will not take “dictation from China’’. The US loan offer has turned controversial because it is linked with the Indo-Pacific Strategy, triggering opposition from a chunk of ruling Nepal Communist Party.Wells said the Covid epidemic had made it incumbent upon China to write-off “predatory and unfair” loans to Pakistan for the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The project lacked transparency, guaranteed unfair rate of profits to Chinese companies and distorts Pakistan’s economy due to mass imbalance in trade with China. “We hope China will waive the loans and create a fair and transparent deal with Pakistan,” she said.The senior official, who retires at the end of this month, said India still did not provide a level playing field for foreign companies and suggested that, its tariffs were too high to attract manufacturing companies.Expanding on her suggestion that India opens talks with Taliban, Wells said there will come a stage when New Delhi will have to do business with the Afghan group after it enters Kabul’s governing structure. “That government’s (a joint Taliban-Ghani-Abdullah government) relationship with India should be close, she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-backs-india-in-border-tensions-with-china-87482

While one flight arrived in Amritsar from USA yesterday, several more are expected to bring Punjabis/NRIs at New Delhi and Amritsar next week.The facilitation centre is coordinating with the state transport department to enable smooth and timely services for taking the returnees back to their home districts in Punjab, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-govt-sets-up-facilitation-centre-at-igi-airport-for-smooth-return-of-nris-punjabis-from-other-nations-87480
20-05-2020||New Delhi||SC notice to Centre, others on plea seeking entry of women in mosques||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Centre to respond to a plea seeking that Muslim women be allowed to enter mosques across the country claiming that such restrictions were  “unconstitutional” and violative of the right to equality and gender justice.A Bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde, hearing the matter through video-conferencing, agreed to hear the petition which has sought setting aside of directions or ‘fatwa’ restraining Muslim women from entering the mosques.Besides the Centre, the Bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, issued notices to others including the Ministry of Minorities Affairs, National Commission for Women and All India Muslim Personal Law Board and sought their responses on the plea.The plea, filed by a Pune-based Muslim woman, has referred to the constitutional provisions and said there should not be any discrimination against any citizen on the ground of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth.“It is very unfortunate that not a single political party or a chief minister, women included, has thought of advancing the interest of Muslim women by providing them access to mosques that receive monetary aid from taxpayers’ money,” the plea has claimed. The petition has alleged that the legislature has failed to ensure the dignity and equality of women in general and Muslim women in particular.“Despite the observation of this court for the past few decades, the goal of ‘Uniform Civil Code’ remains an elusive constitutional goal that the courts have fairly refrained from enforcing through directions and the legislature has dispassionately ignored it,” it claimed.The plea alleged that Muslim women are being discriminated against as they are not allowed to enter and pray in the main prayer hall of mosques in violation of Articles 14 (equality before law) and 2l (protection of life and personal liberty) of the Constitution.It has sought a direction to permit women to pray in the ‘musalla’  “without being separated by a barrier, including in the front and in mixed-gender congregational lines”.It has sought to declare the practice of prohibiting entry of Muslim women in mosque in India as illegal, unconstitutional and being violative of constitutional rights. “There is a well-established proliferation in media nowadays about the ‘burqa clad’ who are thoroughly victimised and need great protection measures through the liberal rights discourse,” it said.The plea said there is nothing in the Holy Quran and the Hadith that requires gender segregation.It said that a life of dignity and equality is the most sacrosanct fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution and it prevails above all other rights available under the laws of India.It said that women are allowed to enter mosques that have a separate space for them, but most mosques in India do not have this facility.

In this case, the heavily-stacked odds against Bihar girl Jyoti Kumari were no match for her grit.Kumari, a lion-hearted 15-year-old, cycled all the way from Gurugram in Haryana to Bihar’s Darbhanga district with her incapacitated father Mohan Paswan seated on the carrier.Now the father-daughter duo is at a quarantine centre near their village Sirhulli under Singhwara block of the district.Kumari is determined not to let her father return to Gurugram where he was driven to penury following an accident a few months ago that rendered him unfit to make a living as an e-rickshaw driver.Paswan said his landlord gave him an ultimatum to either pay the rent that was due for a few months, or leave.“I succeeded in buying time on a couple of occasions. I promised him that I would take up whatever job I could land once the lockdown was lifted, earn money and pay all his dues. We were so hard pressed that I had to discontinue my medicines so that we could afford one square meal a day. How could we have arranged money for rent?” he recounted.                  But the lockdown kept getting extended and the threats of the landlord kept getting more severe, he said.At that time Jyoti was looking after her father in Gurugram while her mother was taking care of her four younger siblings back in the village while working as an Aanganwadi worker.“Amid the gloomy situation, Jyoti suggested that we return home. I pointed out that we would not be able to find any trains or buses soon and my condition would not allow me to walk. She said we should get a bicycle,” said Paswan, his face betraying the sense of bewilderment he felt when she first came up with the suggestion.He tried hard to dissuade his daughter, telling her that the journey was not a matter of 10, 20 or even 100 km and that driving a bicycle with a pillion rider much heavier than herself was no mean feat. But Jyoti persisted.“Battered by misfortune, I had become a fatalist. I gave in to her pestering and purchased a used bicycle with the help of whatever savings we still had. And then we hit the road,” Paswan said.Jyoti said they would cycle for 30-40 km a day and at a few places truck drivers gave them lifts.“It was unbearably tiring. We would stop by for a quick bite at places where we could spot unlucky ones like us being fed by local Samaritans. At a few spots, we hitched rides on trucks. Drivers, taking pity on us, would help by dropping us to a point from where our paths diverged,” recalled the girl.“It must have taken eight days... and then, here we were! Back home!” said an elated Jyoti, her fatigue making it difficult to remember the date on which they had started.The father smiled with a hint of pride when asked about his daughter being compared in the local media to the character of Shravan Kumar from the epic Ramayana, who took his old and frail parents on a long pilgrimage with his mother and father seated in baskets hanging at the ends of a pole he carried on his shoulders.“She is indeed my Shravan Kumar. The journey back home has been nothing short of a pilgrimage. Having arrived feels like salvation,” Paswan said.

20-05-2020||New Delhi||CBSE releases cyber safety guide for students||From measures to deal with cyber bullying and stalking to digital rights, freedom and responsibilities, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has come up with a cyber safety manual for students from Class IX to XII to ensure development of safe and healthy online habits among them.The manual has been prepared at a time when students have increased access to the digital world with classroom teaching suspended due to the COVID-19-induced lockdown, and teaching and learning activities being conducted online.While the manual has covered cyber safety topics such as cyberbullying, including social exclusion, intimidation, defamation, emotional harassment, online sexual abuse, cyber radicalisation, online attack and frauds and online enticement, it also talks about nine elements of digital citizenship — digital access, literacy, communication, etiquette, health and wellbeing, rights, freedom and responsibility, security and law.The manual, developed in collaboration with Cyber Peace Foundation, has also prescribed activities to assess the knowledge of students on the topics covered."Many young people are confident in using a wide range of technologies and often turn to the Internet for information but the confidence with digital technology can also be misleading.  Many of them frequently struggle when applying them to research tasks,” said the CBSE.They can find it difficult to work out whether information on an unfamiliar website is trustworthy, and rely on their chosen search engine's rankings for their selection of material, the board said."They may not understand how search terms work or of the powerful commercial forces that can result in a particular company being top of the search engine's list. They may not be aware of the lurking risks and threats and the fact that some of their actions can invite them trouble," said the CBSE.How to navigate through the cyberspace, ability to find and select information, identifying fake news, opportunities and risks, caution against revenge pornography, hazards of providing sensitive information online, how to report inappropriate content, are among the subjects addressed by the manual in detail. The board said “a fine line separates bullying from teasing”.“Different people have a different threshold of tolerance for being able to take teasing or cyberbullying,” the CBSE added.Students must know and understand what cyberbullying is and never engage in that kind of behaviour, it said.The CBSE said, “Students need to be told that they must block and if need be report using the site's reporting function as soon as possible if someone makes you uncomfortable on a social networking site.”"Cyberstalking is when an individual is repeatedly or constantly followed, watched or contacted through any electronic means. The movement of the child is tracked and privacy is invaded or persistent efforts are made to contact someone against their will through text, email, social media, or other digital platforms," it added.The manual also has tips for students on digital health and wellness."Digital health and wellness is the ability to use technology like mobile phones, laptops, desktops and tablets and not using too much till the point where it hurts. Excessive and improper use of technology could lead to lifestyle changes that affect everyday life negatively," the CBSE said.

20-05-2020||New Delhi||Ola to lay off 1,400 staff as COVID-19 pandemic hits revenues||Cab aggregator Ola is laying off 1,400 staff from rides, financial services and food business as revenues declined by 95 per cent in the last two months due to coronavirus pandemic, a note by CEO Bhavish Aggarwal said.In an email to employees, Aggarwal made it clear that the prognosis ahead for the business is “very unclear and uncertain” and the impact of this crisis is “definitely going to be long-drawn for us”.“The fallout of the virus has been very tough for our industry in particular. Our revenue has come down 95 per cent over the past 2 months. Most importantly, this crisis has affected the livelihoods of millions of our drivers and their families across India and our international geographies,” he said.The company has decided to downsize and “let go” of 1,400 employees, Aggarwal added.He said this will be a one-time exercise and will be complete by the end of this week for the India Mobility business, and by the end of next week for Ola foods and Ola Financial Services.“No more COVID-related cuts will be done after this exercise,” he noted.Aggarwal explained that more companies are expected to have a large number of employees work from home, air travel will be limited to essential trips and vacations being put off for better times.“...the impact of this crisis is definitely going to be long-drawn for us. The world is not going to revert to the pre-COVID era anytime soon. Social distancing, anxiety, and an abundance of caution will be the operating principles for everyone,” he said.In the past few weeks, a number of tech-led businesses like Uber, Zomato and Swiggy have announced layoffs as the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown dried up demand and ravaged businesses.Zomato has laid off 13 per cent of its 4,000-staff, while Swiggy said it will let go off 1,100 employees. Uber is laying off 3,000 people globally and the move is expected to impact India operations as well.Last year, Ola had undertaken a restructuring exercise of its 4,500-workforce that resulted in about 350 employees being laid off.Aggarwal, in his mail, said the crisis necessitated the need to conserve cash aggressively so that it is able to invest in opportunities in the future.“While we restructure our organisation to the new realities of our business, we are also going to recommit ourselves to strengthening our operational excellence.“We are increasing our investments and adding people capabilities in R&D as a group, through this crisis to double down on innovation and engineering...This crisis is accelerating macro trends of digital commerce and clean mobility, and our businesses are well-positioned to leverage these macro trends well,” he said.The company has, in the past, spoken of its aim to turn profitable and go public in the next few years.Aggarwal said the impacted employees will receive a minimum financial payout of 3 months of their fixed salary, irrespective of the notice period.           “Employees who have spent significantly more time with us will be eligible for higher payouts depending on tenure,” he said.Also, all eligible ESOPs will vest forward to the closest quarter and for those who may not have completed a year, as an exception, Ola will enable pro-rated vesting for the period of time spent with the company, he added.“All affected employees will be able to continue using their medical, life and accident insurance cover for themselves and their families up to December 31, 2020 or the start of their next job whichever is earlier, to help minimise the financial burden of health and other risks in a time like this,” Aggarwal said.The company has also decided to offer medical insurance for up to 2 parents (or in-laws) to each employee. This insurance will cover parents for all pre-existing ailments up to the age of 90, for a sum of Rs 2 lakhs.“While we have made every possible effort to accommodate as many affected team members in open roles in our other group companies, we are rallying the support of the Ola Talent Acquisition team to help with outplacement support for as many people and in helping find suitable roles for them outside of Ola,” he said.In addition to this, we are also allowing all company-issued laptops (primary work devices) to be retained by affected employees, he added.Aggarwal said all members of Ola’s extended leadership team have taken significant salary cuts.“We had all hoped in the beginning that this would be a short-lived crisis and that its impact would be temporary.“Over the past couple of months, all members of our extended leadership team have taken significant salary cuts to be able to help the organisation delay tougher people decisions as we waited for the situation to evolve. But unfortunately, it’s not been a short crisis,” he said.Aggarwal said economic activity returns, so will the need for mobility.“Formats will evolve depending on context - personal, shared, public transit, or the niches in between. This pandemic has only highlighted the need for each of us to have safe and reliable mobility solutions. As economic activity returns, so will the need for mobility, but the paradigm will have changed,” he said. –PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ola-to-lay-off-1-400-staff-as-covid-19-pandemic-hits-revenues-87437

20-05-2020||New Delhi||Decide corruption cases in time involving retiring bank, govt officials: CVC||Probity watchdog CVC has asked all banks and central government departments to ensure expeditious finalisation of disciplinary proceedings against officials involved in alleged corruption cases who are due to retire shortly.The move comes after it was noticed that some cases of alleged corruption do not get disposed even until the retirement of an accused public servant.The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has been writing to the government departments since 2007, most recently in July 2019, on the issue to ensure that the accused officers are brought to justice in time.The CVC had specifically impressed upon the vigilance functionaries as well as administrative authorities concerned the need to prioritise their activities of conducting investigations and completion of disciplinary action well in advance so as to avoid late reference to the Commission, it said in a recent directive.“Further, it was also conveyed that all such retirement cases  should be received by the first week of the month of superannuation of the officer(s) concerned,” said the directive, issued to secretaries of central government departments and the chairman and managing directors of public sector banks, undertakings and autonomous organisations.It said the cases or references received for advice after the first week of the month would be returned to the department without advice of the Commission and “action recommended against the concerned authority(ies)”.“The Commission while reiterating its earlier instructions would emphasise that all such retirement cases for advice should be received in the Commission by 10th of every month by 5 PM. Further, if 10th is a holiday, by the next working days,” reads the directive seeking its “strict compliance”.

20-05-2020||Vijay Mohan||Coronavirus: DRDO developing AI-based face recognition system for marking attendance||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 20With new norms on personal contact and handling gadgets being implemented in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is developing an artificial intelligence-based face recognition system for marking attendance of employees.The system will do away with the need for physically marking attendance through biometric machines or on paper sheets, while also preventing people from crowding around attendance machines.Sources said the DRDO’s Defence Bio-engineering and Electro-medical Laboratory is developing the system and after successful trials and validation, it would be implemented across other DRDO laboratories. “The system could also be made available to other organisations and has a vast scope for commercialisation,” a DRDO scientist said.A database of employees containing their photograph from multiple angles along with personal details would be prepared. A camera would capture the face image of a person walking in or out of an office complex, which would be marked with a time stamp and a specially developed software would then collate it with the database and prepare a record of entry and exit and link it with the organisation’s internal computer network.“We expect the laboratory to complete the project in a year’s time,” the scientist said. “Besides attendance of employees, the system will also be used for visitor management,” he added.Artificial intelligence-based face recognition systems are making increasing headway in the defence and security establishments for intelligence analysis as well as access control. Several projects are already under way in this field to develop new and faster tools to shift from manual processes and reduce human interface.Face recognition is a very important aspect to distinguish between friend and foe. There  is  no  automated  face  recognition  system existing  in  Indian  Army  to  recognise enemy  face  in  real time. The Military Intelligence is developing an automated face recognition system to recognise and establish the identity of an enemy face from still photographs or video images in real time.Last year, the Border Security Force initiated a pilot project to install face recognition-based access-control system at gates in the fence along the Indo-Pakistan border through which farmers move to till their land.The Ministry of Home Affairs has also developed a facial recognition system to track criminals. It has been linked with the National Crime and Criminal Tracking System that contains a national database of all police and court cases across the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-drdo-developing-ai-based-face-recognition-system-for-marking-attendance-87420

20-05-2020||New Delhi||Pending board exams to be held in schools where students enrolled, result by July-end: HRD||Students will appear for pending class 10 and 12 board exams at the schools where they are enrolled instead of an external test centre, according to the HRD Ministry.The Ministry is also planning to declare the board exam results by July-end and evaluation process has already begun for exams which were conducted before the lockdown was announced.According to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) officials, students will appear at their individual schools for the exams and not external test centres.“Students will appear for the exams in their own schools and not external test centres to ensure minimum travel for them. Schools will be responsible for ensuring social distancing norms are followed and students will be required to carry their own sanitiser bottles and cover their face with mask,” a board official said.The information was also shared by HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ in a live interaction with students aired on DD News on Tuesday night.Usually, board examinations are held at designated test centres for students. This is to ensure minimum bias from schools for their students and to enable independent external invigilators to monitor the examination process.The board on Monday announced the date sheet for the pending class 10 and 12 board exams, which will now be held from July 1-15 with strict distancing norms in place.The exams were postponed due to the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of COVID-19.While class 12 exams will be conducted across the country, the class 10 exams are only pending in North East Delhi, where they could not be held due to the law and order situation in the wake of protests against the amended citizenship act.The HRD minister said that efforts are being made to ensure that the result is declared by July-end.“Efforts are being made to declare the result by July-end itself. Evaluation process has already begun for the board exams and will continue to be held simultaneously with pending exams. Teachers who are involved in the evaluation process will be exempted from delivering academic and administrative work for the tenure,” he said in the interaction.The CBSE class 10 and class 12 board exam evaluation is being carried out from home. Further, the HRD Ministry had earmarked 3000 evaluation centres from where answer sheets would be distributed to teachers at their homes for evaluation and then collected.MHA allows schools to hold board examsThe central government has today written to states giving exemption in lockdown guidelines to partially open schools for conducting board examinations for Classes 10 and 12.Union Home Minister Amit Shah tweeted Home Secretary Ajay Bhall’s letter to chief secretaries of all the states and Union territories. The letter said:   “Taking into consideration the academic interest of large number of students, it has been decided to grant exemption from the lockdown measures to conduct Board examination for classes 10th and 12th, with few conditions like social distancing, face mask etc, for their safety”.  In the letter, Bhalla said that under the guidelines on lockdown measures, opening of schools has been prohibited and as a result annual board examinations being conducted by state education boards, CBSE and ICSE for Classes 10 and 12 were suspended.The Union Home Secretary mentioned in the letter that requests were received from the state governments and CBSE for conducting board examinations and the matter has been examined in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).“Taking into consideration the academic interest of a large number of students, it has been decided to grant exemption from the lockdown measures to conduct board examinations for classes 10 and 12,” Bhalla said.The Home Secretary, however, said that the exemption to conduct board examinations “would be subject to the conditions that no examination centre will be permitted in containment zones and face masks will be worn by teachers, staff and students mandatorily”. He went on to add that there shall be provision of thermal screening and sanitiser at exam centres and social distancing norms have to be followed.“In view of the examinations to be conducted by different boards, their exam schedules should be staggered and special buses can be arranged by states and union territories for transportation of students to examination centres,” the letter read.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16 when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as one of the measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.Later, a 21-day nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, which came into effect the next day. It has now been extended till May 31.The board was not able to conduct class 10 and 12 exams on eight examination days due to the coronavirus outbreak.Further, due to the law and order situation in North East Delhi, the board was not able to conduct exams on four examination days, while a very small number of students from and around this district were not able to appear in exams on six days.The board had last month announced that it will only conduct pending exams in 29 subjects which are crucial for promotion and admission to higher educational institutions.The modalities of assessment for the subjects for which exams are not being conducted will be announced soon by the board.The schedule has been decided in order to ensure that the board exams are completed before competitive examinations such as engineering entrance JEE-Mains, which is scheduled from July 18-23, and medical entrance exam NEET, which is scheduled on July 26.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pending-board-exams-to-be-held-in-schools-where-students-enrolled-result-by-july-end-hrd-87408
20-05-2020||Chennai||Pests in a pandemic? India's plant doctors will see you online now||When Victor Mary's husband decided to travel abroad for work, he left her a plot of land to cultivate in southern India and a new mobile phone that would help them stay in touch.Fresh to farming, Mary found herself struggling after India's coronavirus lockdown began in March, unsure of how to fight the pests attacking her paddy and groundnut crops.Initially she called her husband in Singapore to ask for advice. But then she realised she could use her phone to dial into an "e-plant clinic", where farmers and experts meet online to discuss crop pests and blight."I was using the phone to only make WhatsApp calls to my husband and complain about things," Mary told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from her home in the Pudukkottai district of Tamil Nadu state."Now I use it to call the plant doctors instead and they help me instantly. I don't have to wait for my husband to finish his work shift," she said.Like Mary, other farmers across India are learning to remotely access similar plant clinics. They were first started in 2012 by bringing experts to a public location in a village twice a month to look at diseased crop samples and suggest remedies.The roughly 30 physical clinics across five Indian states have now been replaced by online ones. So far seven sessions during the COVID-19 lockdown have seen more than 350 farmers participate from Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Assam and Puducherry.Rising temperatures due to a warming global climate have also increased pest populations, agricultural experts said, adding it was crucial to control pest attacks quickly to help farmers protect their yield.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that annually 20% to 40% of crop production worldwide is lost to pests, with plant diseases costing the global economy about $220 billion and invasive insects about $70 billion.In India, jasmine flowers, groundnut, eggplant, chilli and rice are some of the crops currently being affected by pests like bud worm, pod borer and thrips, which have been brought up by farmers in the e-clinics.With an exodus of migrant workers returning home due to the coronavirus pandemic, farmers have been left to tend to their plots alone, slowing down the process of pest control."Shortage of labour has increased the chance of pests due to upkeep issues," said Jayashree Balasubramanian, a director at the Chennai-based MS Swaminathan Research Foundation.The charity, which backs the use of modern science for sustainable farming, runs the plant clinics with the non-profit Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CABI)."If farmers neglect any disease now, their lockdown losses will also impact the next cropping season. They need experts to help them and technology has fast-forwarded its way into their lives," said Balasubramanian.VIRTUAL DIAGNOSISMary met "plant doctor" Rajkumar Ramasamy for the first time virtually during an e-clinic earlier this month for farmers from Pudukkottai.The mother of two said that, despite a patchy connection, her plant sample was diagnosed and treatment suggested. "I was quite excited to attend this online meeting," she said."I felt very happy that I could follow the instructions sent to me via a message and then download (the app) on my phone and connect to the plant doctor. It felt like an achievement."Ramasamy, who has worked with the plant clinic initiative since it began in 2012, was enthusiastic too."We had not planned to do anything during the lockdown but within days farmers started sending us pictures of their infested plants and asking us for help," he said."Then a young farmer suggested going online and we sent out a link asking farmers to register. Only 17 registered but on the day of the e-clinic, 48 joined. It was amazing."Ramasamy and his colleagues have been able to provide timely advice via the web to farmers who showed them samples of sick crops to reduce their losses even during the lockdown, also sharing information on where they could get pesticides.Farmer S Mathiyalagan, 51, needed his son's help to log in and learn how to participate in an online meeting.The chilli farmer said he was nervous, unfamiliar with how to mute and un-mute himself, and not sure if the infected plant he was holding up was visible to the doctors."But it worked," he said over the phone, adding that he may need less help from his son next time.Encouraged by the experiences of Mary and Mathiyalagan, the plant doctors now feel virtual clinics could expand their reach tremendously in the future."The only thing is to teach farmers how to use technology," Ramasamy said.For example, they need to figure out how to hold the plant in front of the camera without blocking it, so the plant doctors can diagnose the problem, he said."Once these issues and internet connectivity are resolved, we could reach thousands of farmers, resolving issues in real time," he added. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pests-in-a-pandemic-indias-plant-doctors-will-see-you-online-now-87396

20-05-2020||Kolkata/Bhubaneswar/New Delhi||Cyclone batters Bengal, Odisha as 6.5 lakh evacuated; 3 dead||An extremely severe cyclone packing winds of up to 190 kmph Wednesday rampaged through coastal Odisha and West Bengal, dumping heavy rain, swamping homes and farmland, and leaving at least three people dead, officials said.While man and a woman were reported killed when trees came crashing down on them in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, a 13-year-old girl died in a similar incident in adjoining Howrah. No casualties have been reported from Odisha yet.Also read: ‘Super cyclone’ to calm down as ‘depression’ by ThursdayWest Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who is monitoring the situation from Nabanna, the state secretariat, however, claimed at least 10-12 people lost their lives. “Area after area has been ruined. I have experienced a war-like situation today. At least 10-12 people have died.Nandigram, Ramnagar....the two districts of North and South 24 Parganas are destroyed,” she said.After making landfall at 2.30 p.m. between Digha in West Bengal and Hatiya island in Bangladesh, cyclone Amphan cut a swathe through the coastal areas, flattening fragile dwellings, uprooting trees and electric poles. At least 6.58 lakh people were evacuated in West Bengal and Odisha before the cyclone struck.“The forward sector of the wall cloud region is entering into land in West Bengal. The intensity of the cyclone near its centre as the landfall process started was recorded at 160-170 kmph, gusting to 190 kmph,” the weather department said.NDRF chief S N Pradhan told a press conference in New Delhi that 20 teams of the federal disaster response force had already begun road clearing operations in Odisha, while the 19 units deployed in West Bengal were shifting people to safety.Quoting figures made available by the two states, Pradhan said over 5 lakh people were evacuated in West Bengal and more than 1.58 lakh in Odisha.TV footage showed gigantic tidal waves crashing into a seawall in Digha, close to the landfall site.Thick sheets of rain blurred the vast coastline in the two states and surging waters engulfed mud-and-thatch houses, flattening them in a trice.Heavy machinery was moved in to clear the roads blocked by falling trees.A video clip of an under-construction Kolkata skyscraper showed huge aluminium sheets flying like bird feathers in air.India Meteorological Department (IMD) Director General Mrityunjay Mohapatra, who jointly addressed the media with Pradhan, said gale-strength winds speeding at 160-170 kmph were pounding South and North 24 Parganas and East Midnapore districts and could be gusting up to 185 kmph.He said the wall of the eye of the monster cyclone, the most explosive part of a cyclonic system, triggered copious rain in the three districts. The eye of the storm itself was 30 km in diameter, he said.Mohapatra said the intensity of the rain and winds accompanying it could deceptively look like ebbing away briefly, but will surge afresh once the rear sector of the storm has reached the landmass.The whole cyclonic system reached the landmass by 7 pm, before moving forward in fury.Reports arriving in Kolkata from North and South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore said roofs of thatched houses were blown away, electric poles got twisted and hundreds of trees broken and uprooted.Streets and homes in low lying areas of Kolkata were swamped with rainwater.Almost the entire city was plunged into darkness since the evening as electric supply either got snapped due to rain and wind or was suspended as a precautionary measure. Cell phone services were disrupted in many places.Despite losing its force a bit since Tuesday, the storm, which was categorised as super cyclone at one point of time, left the two eastern states on edge as it hollered on its destructive path.Mamata Banerjee said the enormity of the devastation will become clearer by Thursday when the storm will have passed over the state.In Odisha, intense rainfall was recorded in several areas of Puri, Khurda, Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack, Kendrapara, Jajpur, Ganjam, Ganjam, Bhadrak and Balasore districts since Tuesday.The rains and high-velocity winds ebbed away by late Wednesday night but not before causing massive damage to standing crops, plantations and infrastructure.Tidal surge of up to five metres occured in North and South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore districts of West Bengal, inundating vast tracts of land, officials said.The turbulence will likely extend to Assam and Meghalaya, triggering heavy to very heavy rain on Thursday.Mohapatra said since the time the depression formed over the Bay of Bengal on May 20 till the cyclone made the landfall, the IMDs predictions about the path it will take and the timing was accurate and helped the disaster response machinery strategise and execute the plans to minimise the damage effectively.The cyclonic storm will get weaker while crossing over Nadia and Murshidabad in West Bengal later tonight before entering Bangladesh as a deep depression and dissipating. Flight operations at Kolkata airport suspended till 5 am tomorrowCargo and evacuation flight operations at the Kolkata airport have been suspended till 5 am of Thursday, airport officials said.“Due to the cyclone, flight operations at Kolkata airport has been suspended till 5 am of May 21,” a senior airport official said.Howrah-New Delhi AC Special Express cancelledThe Eastern Railway (ER) has cancelled the departure of Howrah-New Delhi AC Special Express train scheduled for Wednesday. The New Delhi-Howrah AC Special Express on Thursday has also been cacelled, railway officials said.It said that since the storm is most likely to cause heavy rain and storm, the departure of 02301 Howrah-New Delhi AC Special Express on Wednesday and 02302 New Delhi-Howrah AC Special Express on May 21 would remain cancelled.The Met department in an advisory asked for stoppage or diversion of train movements owing to damage likely to be caused by the super cyclonic storm.The cyclone lay centred about 240 km south of Digha in West Bengal on Wednesday morning as an extremely severe cyclonic storm, the Met said here.The intensity near the centre of the storm was 170 to 180 kmph gusting to 200 kmph, the Met said.

It has been termed as the biggest government-sponsored healthcare scheme in the world.“It would make every Indian proud that the number of Ayushman Bharat beneficiaries has crossed 1 crore. In less than two years, this initiative has had a positive impact on so many lives,” the prime minister wrote on Twitter. During my official tours, I would interact with Ayushman Bharat beneficiaries. Sadly, that is not possible these days but I did have a great telephone interaction with Pooja Thapa from Meghalaya, the 1 croreth beneficiary. Here is what we discussed. https://t.co/vsUOEEo5pMHe congratulated all the beneficiaries and their families and prayed for their good health. He appreciated the doctors, nurses, healthcare workers and all others associated with Ayushman Bharat, saying their efforts have made it the largest healthcare programme in the world. “This initiative has won the trust of several Indians, especially the poor and downtrodden,” he said. One of the biggest benefits of Ayushman Bharat is portability, the prime minister pointed out. “Beneficiaries can get top quality and affordable medical care not only where they registered but also in other parts of India. This helps those who work away from home or are registered at a place where they don’t belong,” he explained.He said during his official tours, he would interact with Ayushman Bharat beneficiaries. “Sadly, that is not possible these days but I did have a great telephone interaction with Pooja Thapa from Meghalaya, the 1 croreth beneficiary,” he said.The prime minister shared the audio clip of the conversation in which Thapa, a soldier’s wife, explains about the surgery she underwent in Shillong using the Ayushman Bharat facility. Her husband is posted in Manipur and could not be with her due to the coronavirus lockdown. Her two small children are being taken care of by the neighbours.On being asked by the prime minister, Thapa said she did not have to pay for the surgery and the medicines.

The issue also figured in a communication from the Centre to West Bengal.As per the revised procedure, the train schedule, including stoppages and destination, would now be finalised by the Ministry of Railways and communicated to the states/UTs concerned to make suitable arrangements for sending and receiving stranded people. Publicity of train schedules, booking of tickets, protocol for entry and movement of passengers, services to be provided in coaches will be done by the Railways.It will also ensure that all passengers are compulsorily screened and only asymptomatic ones allowed to board trains.

20-05-2020||---||China joins in as WHO meet okays virus source probe||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 19China has joined a resolution seeking to identify the zoonotic source of the Covid virus at the World Health Assembly (WHA) which was passed unanimously. India was among the countries that had joined the resolution before the start of the Assembly on Monday at a time when it was being interpreted as seeking to corner China.The US agenda of seeking Taiwan’s inclusion at the Assembly, targeting the WHO Director and pinning down China did not turn out as planned after a majority of countries supported the tackling of non-Covid issues after the pandemic.On the other hand, the resolution called for a non-profit seeking approach by voluntary pooling and licensing of patents to ensure affordable diagnostics, medicines and vaccines.While US President Donald Trump has frozen funding to the WHO, the resolution sought sustainable funding to ensure it can fully respond to public health needs. It also asked the WHO to demonstrate leadership on health in the UN system, and “continue to act as the health cluster lead” in the UN humanitarian response.On the US demand to evaluate the WHO’s response to Covid, most countries demonstrated a desire to wait till the crisis was over and then ask the DG for an impartial and independent evaluation of the lessons learnt from the WHO’s response to the pandemic. China interpreted the adoption of the resolution as seeking to support the WHO in playing a lead role.US threatens to quit50 ventilators on wayThe first tranche of 50 ventilators of the 200 that the US is planning to donate to India is expected to arrive soon. The move is part of efforts to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the fight against Covid pandemic, an American official said on Tuesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-joins-in-as-who-meet-okays-virus-source-probe-87097
20-05-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Additional troops deployed along Ladakh border||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 19Over three weeks after fresh escalation of tension between Indian and Chinese troops in Eastern Ladakh, both sides have added additional troops at two locations — Galwan and north bank of Pangong Tso, some 110 km away from each other.Flare-up triggerEastern Ladakh shares a 826-km frontier with China. Galwan and north bank areas are usually patrolled and are at an altitude in excess of 14,000 feet.The cause of the recent flare-up is said to be the two roads that India has built in recent past and China is said to be at a disadvantage at both the spots.At Galwan, China does not have a road on its side and has amassed an estimated 800 troops on its side. At the north bank of Pangong, China is objecting to a road made by India between one of the eight mountain spurs that end at the lake. In Galwan, the 255-km Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DS-DBO) section of the road between Leh and Karakoram Pass was completed last year and China has an issue with its alignment despite the road passing totally in Indian territory. At the north bank of Pangong Tso, the two sides clashed with each other on the intervening night of May 5/6. Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial melt lake, straddles India and China at an altitude of 13,000 feet. Indian troops are at a location that India perceives as its territory along the disputed Line of Actual Control. The People’s Liberation Army of China disputes Indian claims at this particular location and their troops are stationed just across this claim line on what is their side.Nepal revises map, says will reclaim LipulekhKathmandu: Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Tuesday asserted that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to Nepal and vowed to “reclaim” them from India through political and diplomatic efforts, as his Cabinet endorsed a new political map showing the three areas as Nepalese territory. Addressing Parliament, Oli said the territories belong to Nepal “but India has made it a disputed area by keeping its Army there”. “Nepalis were blocked from going there after India stationed its Army,” he said.

20-05-2020||Vibha Sharma||3 lakh shifted in Bengal as Amphan closes in||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 19Amphan will make the landfall tomorrow as an “Extremely Severe Cyclone”, the IMD today said, reiterating its warning for extensive damage in coastal parts of West Bengal and north Odisha.Read Also:  The authorities have reportedly evacuated 3 lakh persons from West Bengal and 1 lakh from Odisha. Its intensity is expected to uproot communication and power poles, disrupt rail and road links in many places and cause extensive damage to standing crops, plantations and orchards in the two statesTo put things in perspective, Cyclone Fani last year and Phailin (the most intense cyclone after the 1999 Odisha “Super Cyclone”) in 2013 also belonged to the category of “Extremely Severe Cyclone(s)”. Experts are relating the intensity Amphan acquired over the sea to achieve the status of “Super Cyclone” to global warming and abnormally warm SSTs (sea surface temperatures). Amphan, they say, is a result of abnormally warm SSTs prevailing in the Indian Ocean.Meanwhile, the cyclone is expected to make a landfall between Digha (West Bengal) and Hatiya Islands (Bangladesh) close to Sundarbans tomorrow afternoon/evening with maximum sustained wind speed of 155-165 kmph gusting to 185 kmph, the IMD said.Amphan was accorded the highest “Super Cyclone” category on Monday. On Tuesday, it moved across the Bay at the speed of 18 kmph. Predicting widespread rain/thundershowers are expected over north Odisha, West Bengal, Sikkim and other Northeastern states over the next two three days, the IMD has forecast very heavy rain over West Bengal tomorrow. While Fani too caused extensive damage in Odisha last year, claiming several lives, the number of those who lost lives was much less than during Phailin because of preparedness of agencies concerned, say officials, pointing to the praise India earned from international organisations for government and volunteer efforts that ensured levels of destruction during Fani to minimum.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/3-lakh-shifted-in-bengal-as-amphan-closes-in-87116
20-05-2020||New Delhi||Global warming making storms violent: Experts||Experts are linking an increased activity in the Indian Ocean and Amphan’s extreme intensity to global warming and abnormally warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs).“Global warming is making these cyclones more and more powerful by heating up ocean/sea surface waters and adding to their strength,” says environmentalist Soumya Dutta.Read Also: “Unless we drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions right now, the worlds’ coastal and river bank population will face even stronger cyclones/typhoons /hurricanes, with humongous losses of property and living assets,” he says Just like a rocket is powered by hydrogen and oxygen, cyclones/hurricanes are powered by water vapour. More global heating means more water vapour and more power to the cyclones.Already, global heating /climate change has caused an over 250 per cent rise in such storms in the past 40 odd years, Dutta says, calling for an immediate decisive action.Meanwhile, according to Simon Wang, Professor of Climate, Utah State University, last year set several new records for Indian Ocean cyclones. “Was this an outlier year or a year that portends things to come? We can’t yet know. But we do know that the Indian Ocean is warming, and we know that warm ocean water is the first, and perhaps the key, ingredient for the formation of tropical cyclones, so the system is primed for more storms.”As per the IMD’s classification, “Super Cyclone” is the highest category of tropical storms, beginning with “Depression” and going to “Deep Depression”, “Severe Cyclone”, “Very Severe Cyclone” and “Extremely Severe Cyclone”. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/global-warming-making-storms-violent-experts-87118

Lallu, Vadra's personal secretary Sandeep Singh and others were charged with forgery in an FIR registered at the Hazratganj police station here, an official spokesperson said.‘Already lost 3 days’Yogi Adityanath ji you can place BJP banners on these buses, if you wish to. You can paste your posters, but please do not reject our spirit of service. Because three days have already been lost to this political grandstanding — Priyanka Vadra, AICC general secyThe case was registered on a complaint by Road Transport Officer (RTO) RP Trivedi, the spokesman said.Meanwhile, a war of words continued between the Uttar Pradesh Government and the Congress for a second day in a row today over the latter’s offer of 1,000 buses to ferry stranded migrants back to the state. The UP Government alleged that the list of 1,000 buses offered by the Congress contained registration numbers of two-wheelers and cars, fuelling a war of words between the two sides.Rejecting the claim, the Congress said the buses were massed at the Rajasthan-Uttar Pradesh border, awaiting permission to cross over into the state’s Agra district. Congress media head Randeep Surjewala alleged that CM Yogi Adityanath was deliberately preventing the party from plying the buses. “Our buses are awaiting a nod to take migrants home but the UP CM is busy playing politics. We urge him to put a stop to this,” Surjewala said.The Congress alleged that late yesterday night the UP government replied to the Congress request and asked for the buses to be ferried to Lucknow with fitness certificates by 10 am today. “After we wrote back saying it is illogical to ask for empty buses to be brought to Lucknow, UP authorities again responded asking us to send 500 buses each to Noida and Gautam Buddha Nagar by 12 noon today along with requisite documents. Our vehicles are now ready and we are hoping the UP CM would put politics behind and let Congress ferry the migrants,” Surjewala said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-cong-chief-booked-for-forgery-amid-row-over-buses-for-migrants-87120
