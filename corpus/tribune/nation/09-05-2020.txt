As many as 80,000 people stranded had been already brought back from other states using various means of transport, he claimed.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC youth wing chief Abhishek Banerjee also tweeted saying Shah should substantiate the charges with facts or else he should apologise.In the letter, Shah said West Bengal was meting out “injustice” to Bengali migrant workers stranded across the country by not allowing the Shramik Special trains to enter the state.The Union Home Minister Amit Shah added that more than 2,00,000 migrant workers had availed the service to reach home. Workers from West Bengal, too, would like to return home, he wrote.Flaunting a document, O’Brien, however, claimed that two trains, each from Punjab and Tamil Nadu, and three from Karnataka, were in the pipeline and these would facilitate the return of over 12,000 people to their respective homes in seven districts of the state between May 10 and 12.One train was scheduled to leave Hyderabad on Saturday and would reach Malda in West Bengal on Sunday with 1,721 passengers, the TMC leader said.The Railways, though, disclosed that they did not have any proposal regarding a train leaving Hyderabad on Saturday for Malda. The Railways officials said 47 special trains for migrant workers were planned for Saturday but none of them was bound for West Bengal.The Railways’ reaction came minutes after the TMC claimed that eight trains had been arranged to ferry migrants from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Telangana.The Congress also pulled up the TMC government and claimed that state government gave green light to eight trains only after receiving Shah’s letter.“The Chief Minister has given permission to eight more trains after Shah wrote to the state,” Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, MP from Berhampore in West Bengal, remarked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-shahs-letter-to-mamata-over-shramik-special-trains-triggers-row-82625

About three crore farmers with agri loans totalling Rs 4,22,113 crore availed the benefit of the 3-month loan moratorium,” Sitharaman said in a tweet.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on March 27, allowed banks to grant a moratorium on instalments of term loans, scheduled to be paid between March 1 and May 31.In order to ease the burden on loan borrowers, she said: “PSBs contacted more than 95 per cent of borrowers eligible for emergency credit lines and working capital enhancements between March 20 to May 6. The amount sanctioned jumped to Rs 54,544 crore, more than double the amount two days ago. The number of cases covered more than tripled.”In an effort to promote rural employment through infra projects, the government has rendered support to states under the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF).“Support of Rs 4,224 crore was provided to states under the RIDF during March 2020 for promoting rural employment through infra projects. Working capital limit of Rs 6,700 crore has been sanctioned for procurement of agriculture commodities to the state government entities since March 2020,” she said in another tweet.The RIDF is a pool created by the shortfall of specified priority sector lending of banks.

While India and China consider it a tri-junction with Nepal, Kathmandu lays claim on the southern part of the pass and refuses to recognise it as a tri-junction.The MEA was reacting to a press release by the Nepalese Foreign Ministry that expressed regret over Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s inauguration of a faster route for pilgrims of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.Also read: India connects to LAC, Kailash Yatra is a road ride away from DelhiNepal claims the road traverses Lipulekh over which it lays claim. But the MEA said the same path was being used by pilgrims and under the present project, it has been made pliable for the ease and convenience of pilgrims, locals and traders.Nepal lays claim over all territory east of Kali River and maintains that there is a disagreement with India over three strips of land, including Lipulekh. A controversy had erupted in November when India included another disputed patch, Kalapani, in its territory in a new political map. MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastav reiterated the stand MEA had taken at that time. He said, “India and Nepal have an established mechanism to deal with all boundary matters. The boundary delineation exercise with Nepal is ongoing. India is committed to resolving outstanding boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue and in the spirit of our close and friendly bilateral relations with Nepal.”The MEA also hoped that the two Foreign Secretaries would meet as soon as the respective governments have dealt with the Covid pandemic.Interestingly, China has a stake in the road since it signed an agreement with India in 2015 to expand trade via Lipulekh and other border points. India and China consider Lipulekh as a trijunction whereas Nepal claims that it has sovereignty over it.After the Lipulekh controversy emerged, Nepalese Foreign Secretary Shanker Das Bairagi reportedly spoke to the Indian envoy Vinay Mohan Kwatra to reiterate Nepal’s concern and its position on the dispute.In the aftermath of the Kalapani controversy, Nepal government had formed two committees and Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had promised to reclaim the disputed land but no talks have been held with New Delhi on the issue.The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) had completed work on the Ghatiabgarh-Lipulekh road on April 17 so that instead of a three-day trek it will now be a two-day drive from Delhi to the pass.Critics say Nepal was late in reacting to the Kalapani issue in 2015 as it protested only after India and China had signed an agreement to expand trade by improving the infrastructure. The road also helps India’s border security apparatus since a security post on the border will be better connected.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-objects-to-shorter-road-route-to-mansarovar-mea-says-territory-lies-in-india-82607

When this (rumours) was brought to my attention, I thought I would let people enjoy their fantasies which is why I did not respond earlier. However, after my party workers and well-wishers also started worrying about my health, I decided to clarify,” Amit Shah said.Adding that he was in good health and had no illness, Shah said in Hinduism, it was believed that such rumours made one stronger and hoped that now people would “stop indulging in these useless exercises and let him do his work”. मेरे स्वास्थ्य की चिंता करने वाले सभी लोगों को मेरा संदेश। pic.twitter.com/F72Xtoqmg9  Amit Shah thanked BJP’s cadres and his well-wishers for their good wishes and said he held no grouse against those spreading such rumours.While Amit Shah is present at most meetings convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the crisis, officials said Amit Shah’s Ministry was directly responsible in formulation and implementation of the lockdown measures, restrictions and relaxations across the country as also coordination with the states and other stakeholders on the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-shah-quashes-health-rumours-says-he-is-perfectly-fine-82603
09-05-2020||New Delhi||Lockdown deprives over 2 crore couples in India from availing contraceptives||As the country remains caught in the throes of the Covid-19 pandemic, access to contraceptives is taking a massive hit, which is pushing the gains made in population stabilisation further down south.The inability of millions of men and women in the country to access contraceptives during the lockdown period is slated to have an adverse impact on reproductive health indicators, maternal and infant mortality.V.S. Chandrashekar, Chief Executive Officer at the Foundation for Reproductive Health Services India (FRHS), said: "Live births may actually be higher since access to abortion is impacted during the lockdown. Women with unintended pregnancy may be forced to carry their pregnancy to term, since they may not have access to abortion care." In 2019, as per the Health Management Information System (HMIS), 3.5 million sterilisations, 5.7 million IUCDs, 1.8 million injectable contraceptive services were provided by the public sector.In addition to this, 41 million cycles of oral contraceptive pills, 2.5 million emergency contraceptive pills and 322 million condoms were made available in the country.Even though medical practitioners and chemists are exempted from the lockdown, curbs on movement of people have resulted in reduced footfalls at such facilities.In line with the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's advisory, public facilities have suspended provisions of sterilisations and IUCDs (intrauterine contraceptive devices) until further notice.This, combined with restrictions on movement, has made access to over the counter contraceptives like condoms, oral contraceptive pills and emergency contraceptive pills difficult. It has also deprived millions of women of their choice of contraception.The FRHS used data of clinical Family Planning (FP) services and sales of over the counter contraceptives in 2018 and 2019 to release a policy brief to estimate the impact of the lockdown on family planning.It revealed that due to limited availability of surgical abortion services, particularly in rural areas, and barriers on availability of medical abortion drugs at chemists, many women may be forced to resort to unsafe providers, risking their health and lives during the lockdown period.The policy brief stated that if the situation does not normalise, 24 to 27 million couples in the country would not be able to access contraceptives, which will result in approximately over two million unintended pregnancies, eight lakh live births, one million abortions, including over a million unsafe abortions and over 2,000 maternal deaths."If proactive measures are not taken, the significant gains made by India in population stabilisation and reducing maternal mortality could be compromised, the policy added.The policy, co-authored by Chandrashekar and Ankur Sagar, Manager of Research and Data Analytics at the FRHS, emphasised that steps need to be taken to ensure that contraceptive services are made available as soon as normalcy is restored.Hindrance of services and proper access to contraception can have serious implications for the family planning programme and should elicit a response from the government.

We have told them we are regularly sending you the correct, updated figures. We don't see any reason why wrong figures are being reflected," said a senior doctor at Safdarjung Hospital who did not want to be named.RML Hospital has reported 52 deaths of COVID-19 patients."We are providing them (government) data regularly and correctly. It is up to them to incorporate it in their chart. We do not understand why they are showing incorrect figures," RML Medical Superintendent Minakshi Bhardwaj said.Lady Hardinge Medical College Director Dr N N Mathur said the hospital has given the government a figure of three deaths.After the discrepancies between the COVID-19 death toll reported by the government and figures from hospitals came to light on Friday, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain asserted that the government is not hiding data."If we had to hide data, we wouldn't have released Thursday's number of fresh COVID-19 cases which was the highest single-day spike of 448 cases. We would have said there were only 48 new cases, but we did not. Once the reports come, the hospitals have to inform the government immediately," he had told reporters.

The asset “germinated out of proceeds of crime has been attached to the extent of Rs 16.38 crore,” the ED added.The provisional attachment order, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), had been issued against AJL and Moti Lal Vora, it said.The federal money-laundering probe agency initiated its investigation into the case after FIRs were registered by Haryana police and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which alleged that a plot number C-17 in Sector-6, Panchkula, was allotted to AJL in 1982.However, the same was resumed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) Estate Officer on October 31, 1992, as AJL did not comply with the conditions of the allotment letter.The resumption order attained finality after the dismissal of the Revision Petition in 1996. However, the then chief minister of the state and HUDA chairman, Bhupendra Singh Hooda, by misusing his official position, had blatantly and dishonestly allotted the said plot afresh in the guise of re-allotment to AJL at original rates plus interest in violation of the necessary conditions on August 28, 2005.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-attaches-rs-16-38-crore-worth-of-mumbai-ajl-asset-names-moti-lal-vora-82590

The germination and flowering have been very robust in all colours, even though slightly late this year,” said Uttrakhand Forest Conservator, head of the research wing, Sanjiv Chaturvedi.The site is spread over 50 hectares.Chaturvedi said: "The particular site was selected because of the climatic conditions and features identical to the place native to the species. Munsyari is the last spot of Kumaon Himalayas—on the Indian side—near the China border, which is located at an altitude of 7,000 feet and faces moderate to heavy snow in winters.""Even on Friday, Khallia top area, which is located at an arm’s length from the trial site, witnessed snow," said junior researcher Yogesh Tripathi.“The bulbs were brought from Holland, famous for its Tulip Park, which millions of people from across the world visit every year. The trials being conducted under the supervision of the research department are in the second stage."“It has been found that till now, success per cent of germination of the bulbs has been more than 90% and there has not been any incidence of disease. Flowering has been very robust and in all types of colours, though this year it has taken place slightly late. In the first week of May, germination and flowering are both excellent,” said Chaturvedi.Tulips have a fascinating historyAccording to an official site—History of Tulips in Holland—tulips were originally cultivated in the Ottoman Empire (present-day Turkey) and were imported into Holland in the sixteenth century.“When Carolus Clusius wrote the first major book on tulips in 1592, they became so popular that his garden was raided and bulbs were stolen on a regular basis. As the Dutch Golden Age grew, so did this curvaceous and colourful flower. They became popular in paintings and festivals. In the mid-seventeenth century, tulips were so popular that they created the first economic bubble, known as"Tulip Mania" (tulipomania). As people bought up bulbs they became so expensive that they were used as money until the market in them crashed,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pictures-tulips-in-bloom-against-backdrop-of-snow-capped-peaks-of-panchachuli-82589

The chat room was used to make comments and share compromising and allegedly morphed images of minor girls.The plea is likely to come up for hearing on May 13.Petitioner Dev Ashish Dubey also sought protection for the girls and women who have highlighted the crime of Delhi school students so that they cannot be harmed by the members of the group.“Since the issue is related to the offence committed against girls and women by the group members of Instagram group named as ‘Bois Locker Room’, which was created by school students mainly staying in South Delhi. Hence the petitioner preferred this PIL,” the plea said.The plea, filed through advocates Dushyant Tiwari and Om Prakash Parihar, sought direction to the Centre and the Delhi government to get the social media chat group incident investigated through a Special Investigation Team (SIT) or the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).It also sought direction to the authorities to arrest all the members of the Instagram group “Bios Locker Room” immediately.“The entire issue needs to be investigated by the SIT or CBI as these students belong to high-profile families and there is an apprehension that the investigation or enquiry conducted by the local police will be influenced and wrongdoers will never be arrested and punished,” it alleged.It said instead of being apologetic or fearful after the vulgar comments and obscene photos posted by them came into public domain, the boys openly threatened the girls and the offence committed by these students through the Instagram group is illegal and amounts to violation of various laws, it said.Earlier, two advocates had written a letter to the Delhi High Court Chief Justice to take suo motu cognisance of the incident.Delhi Police’s Cyber cell have arrested the 18-year-old admin of the chat group. He appeared for his Class 12 Board examinations this year.Police have said he is a student of a school in Delhi-NCR and four group members, who all are majors, above 18 years, have joined the probe.The juveniles, who are part of the group, are being quizzed at their home in the presence of their parents and members of NGOs. A juvenile member was apprehended.The Delhi Commission of Women (DCW) had issued a notice to Instagram and the Delhi Police, taking cognisance of the matter.

This comes after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approved the PGI to conduct trial plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients.The two donors—Fiza Gupta and Arnav Gupta—donated their plasma to support critically sick Covid-19 patients. PGI Director Prof. Jagat Ram thanked the family for coming forward voluntarily for this noble cause. Recently, the PGI was selected as one of the national centers by the ICMR to conduct the trial of convalescent plasma therapy in patients with serious COVID-19 infection.With this approval, serious sick COVID-19 positive patients admitted to Nehru Hospital Extension Block will be eligible to get this form of treatment. In this trial, antibodies from the blood of patients, who have recovered from COVID-19, are used to treat severely infected patients. However, the exact role of this therapy in the treatment of Covid-19 positive patients is still debatable and hence, the ICMR decided to conduct a multicentric study to clarify its role in these patients.The collaborative departments for this trial are Departments of Internal Medicine, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Transfusion Medicine, Endocrinology, Virology and community Medicine. The team of doctors from the Department of Transfusion Medicine will start getting in touch with patients, who have recovered from COVID-19 infection and would explain the nature of the study.The study is aimed at assessing the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma to limit complications in Covid-19 patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-recovered-coronavirus-patients-donate-plasma-at-pgi-chandigarh-82586

This is the Indian Navy's first massive evacuation exercise during the COVID-19 lockdown.Inspector General of Police Vijay Sakhare said 431 people travelling via ship are from Kerala.Rest of the passengers are from other parts of the country, including Tamil Nadu (132 people). A few people from states, including Goa, Haryana, Arunachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana and Lakshadweep, are also travelling in the ship."All these people disembarked from the ship will be sent to Institutional Quarantine facilities for 14 days," Sakhare, who is also the commissioner of the Kochi City police, told PTI.The Keralite passengers, once cleared by all statutory organisations, would be transported to different districts in KSRTC buses (30 per bus). Police would escort them till their quarantine facilities in every single district, he said."The people from other states will stay in the quarantine facilities in Ernakulam for 14 days," said Sakhare who is the in-charge of the operations.Asked about the transportation of the people from other states after completion of their 14-day quarantine, Sakhare said a decision in this regard would be taken after consultations with the Central and their state governments.Narrating the steps taken by the state government to ensure safe quarantine of the symptomatic people, the top official said such passengers would be segregated and disembarked first, followed by other passengers (district wise) in batches of 50 people."We have a thermal scanning system at the entry itself. When they get down from the ship, they will be subjected to thermal scanning. If somebody has heightened temperature he or she will be segregated and sent to the hospitals for formal check-up. The hospital will decide if they need to be isolated or sent to the Institutional Quarantines set up by the state government," said.Ambulances for transporting symptomatic passengers to quarantine centres are ready, he added.Majority of the passengers coming via ship from Maldives are migrant labourers. The number of tourists and professionals travelling in the ship are very few, official sources said.Before arrival at Cochin, on board the vessel, the Navy would get the self e-declaration data filled by all passengers and also identify the passengers symptomatic of COVID-19.

09-05-2020||Chandigarh||Why airmen are leaving Indian Air Force||An internal survey of the Indian Air Force (IAF) has revealed that airmen are leaving the service due to lack of a suitable environment and better prospects in civilian life.As per a letter, circulated by Wester Air Command to all Air Officers Commanding (AOC), Station Commanders and Commanding Officers (CO) of its units, dated April 30, the survey was conducted for two years with the target audience of Sergeants with a service bracket of 13-20 years.Also read:Rs 1,200 crore for modernisation of 37 airfieldsTeam of Army, IAF personnel rescue helicopter crew in daring ops in Sikkim About 32 per cent responded that airmen leave, after 20 years, due to lack of a suitable environment, while 25 per cent believed that there are better prospects in civilian life.Other reasons were, frequent movement (19 per cent), lack of career progression (17 per cent) and poor pay (7 per cent).The analysis of the data for the past five years, by Air Force Record Office (AFRO), has revealed that 45 per cent airmen proceeded on discharge after completion of initial regular engagement of 20 years without availing further extension of service.“Any professional organisation can ill afford to lose trained and experienced human resource, in such large numbers. It is essential that necessary steps need to be initiated to retain expertise, as it would have an adverse impact on the functioning of IAF,” said the letter.It is also mentioned that IAF is a technology-intensive force and in order to maintain various platforms at a high state of readiness, it is imperative “to have experienced and trained manpower”.It adds that IAF invests “valuable time and resources to train and maintain skilled air warriors for ensuring the availability of equipment in the desired state”.The Western Air Command has asked its field commanders to sensitise airmen about the policy changes in the last few years."Engagement of air warriors by field commanders will go a long way in convincing many of them to continue in service. Towards this, all the field commanders are to give feedback so that the same can be used by Air Headquarters in shaping future policies,” said the letter.The feedback has to be sent by May 17.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-airmen-are-leaving-indian-air-force-82569

He has been transferred," a top official of BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said, requesting anonymity.The reins of the prestigious hospital -- which is one of the major Covid-19 treatment facilities in the city -- has been handed over to Ramesh Bharmal, former Dean of BYL Nair Hospital, who is likely to assume charge today.The decision is said to have been taken late on Friday, reportedly based on the tentative findings of an enquiry into the incident when around half-a-dozen bodies were shown lying on beds around Covid-19 patients, allegedly in the Sion Hospital three days ago.Following a massive furore over the macabre video expose, Mayor Kishori Pednekar had visited the hospital and ordered a probe into the lapses.Late on Friday, the state government had transferred the BMC Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi and appointed senior IAS officer Iqbal Singh Chahal as the new chief of Asia's biggest and India's richest civic body.The shake-ups came with Mumbai emerging as the worst Covid-19 hotspot notching a total of 462 deaths besides 12,142 patients, the highest in the country.

09-05-2020||Washington||COVID-19: Legislation introduced in Congress to give Green Card to 40,000 foreign nurses, doctors||Several American lawmakers have introduced a legislation in Congress to offer the 40,000 unused green cards to thousands of foreign nurses and doctors to meet the urgent needs of the overstretched healthcare sector in the US, the worst hit nation by the coronavirus pandemic.The US has nearly 12,84,000 cases of confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 77,000 people have died due to the highly contagious disease.The Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act would allow for recapturing green cards that were approved by Congress but unused in past years, allowing thousands of additional medical professionals to serve permanently in the United States.The legislation would send green cards to 25,000 nurses and 15,000 doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure that states like Iowa have the professionals they need to serve patients for years to come, a media release said.The move is likely to benefit a large number of Indian nurses and doctors in the US, who are either on H-1B or J2 visas.The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.A Green Card, known officially as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued to immigrants to the US as evidence that the bearer has been granted the privilege of residing permanently.In the House of Representatives, the legislation has been introduced by lawmakers Abby Finkenauer, Brad Schneider, Tom Cole and Don Bacon. The bipartisan Senate companion bill is led by Senators David Perdue, Dick Durbin, Todd Young and Chris Coons.“We need all hands on deck to address this generational crisis,” congresswoman Finkenauer said.“We know this virus will not magically disappear and experts like Dr Anthony Fauci are warning of a second wave this fall. Rural areas, which make up much of my district, remain especially vulnerable and are already experiencing a shortage of medical professionals,” she said.The act is endorsed by organisations such as the American Medical Association, the Healthcare Leadership Council, the US Chamber of Commerce, the American Association of International Healthcare Recruitment, the American Hospital Association, the American Organization for Nursing Leadership, the Bipartisan Policy Center, the America’s Essential Hospitals and the Physicians for American Healthcare Access.“Physicians fighting COVID-19 are eager to hear these words: reinforcements are on the way. Recapturing 15,000 unused immigrant visas for physicians through the Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act would ease the burden on frontline physicians, who are risking their lives in understaffed hospitals,” said Patrice A Harris, president of the American Medical Association.The American Hospital Association (AHA) and the American Organization for Nursing Leadership (AONL) said there has never been a more urgent need for the care that foreign-born physicians and foreign-trained nurses provide than during the current COVID-19 pandemic. These professionals play a critical role in ensuring the health of our communities, they said.

The police had a tough time in clearing them and providing safe passage to the top officials.Some local police officials were trying to pacify the protesters and persuade them to end the sit-in agitation.Earlier, residents of Gopalapuram, the worst affected among five villages surrounding the plant, staged a sit-in, raising slogans against the company. Police detained and removed them from there.Several other villagers including women also reached there and demanded that the government come to their rescue by shutting down the plant.They voiced apprehensions over the long-term impact of Styrene leaked from the plant on the environment and on their health. "The government should immediately shut down the plant and shift it to some other place," demanded a protester.The villagers also demanded that a high-power committee constituted by the government to probe the gas leak should hold talks with the people of the five villages surrounding the plant and not the company's management.They also wanted the authorities to improve the oxygen level in the villages to ensure their early return. They said the government should come out with the details about the level of Styrene in the air and whether it is safe for their return to the villages."The gas leak has badly affected the health of many of us. There could be long-term impact. The government should conduct regular health camps to check our health status," demanded another villager.Many protesters demanded strong action against the company management for not following the safety norms. They said had the siren blared from the plant many lives could have been saved.Styrene had leaked from the plant around 3.45 a.m. on Thursday. The incident claimed 12 lives while over 400 were taken ill and had to be hospitalized.District officials said 10,000 people from five villages were shifted to relief camps. They have been asked to stay in the camps till they are declared safe for return to the village.

Therefore, people can survive as it depends on the amount of poison that you have consumed. Only one person was unaffected, maybe he did not consume much, he said.Three people are still undergoing treatment and are recovering. Two of them are at the North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences (NEIGRIHMS) and one in Woodland Hospital, Dr War said.He said the health department can only appeal to the people, especially those in the rural areas, to refrain from eating wild mushrooms, while the horticulture department should take measures to create awareness.

There will be no need for testing prior to discharge," the revised discharge policy stated.At the time of discharge, the patient will be advised to follow home isolation for further seen days as per the prescribed guidelines.At any point of time, prior to discharge from COVID Care Centre, if oxygen saturation dips below 95 per cent, the patient will be moved to Dedicated COVID Health Centre.After discharge from the facility, if he/she again develops symptoms of fever, cough or breathing difficulty he will contact the COVID Care Centre or state helpline or 1075. His or her health will again be followed up through teleconference on day 14, it said.

09-05-2020||New Delhi||5 Indian hospitals approved to join WHO's Solidarity Trial to find COVID-19 treatment||Five hospitals, two from Ahmedabad and one each from Chennai, Jodhpur and Bhopal, have so far been approved to conduct randomised controlled clinical trials under WHO's Solidarity Trial to find an effective treatment for COVID-19.The hospitals, including the AIIMS in Jodhpur, Apollo Hospital in Chennai and the B J Medical College and Civil Hospital in Ahmedabad, will be conducting clinical trials on four treatment protocols — remdesivir, combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir and ritonavir with Interferon beta-1a.According to Dr Sheela Godbole, national coordinator of the WHO-India Solidarity Trial and head of the Division of Epidemiology at ICMR-National AIDS Research Institute, there is a plan to enrol at least 20 clinical sites across India.The clinical trials on any of the treatment protocols would be discontinued if it showed any adverse effects on any of the patients, Godbole said. The health facilities need to get regulatory approval from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) and have to be registered on the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) for this.Four of the hospitals have already begun the trial."We want as many patients as possible to be quickly enrolled in the randomised controlled clinical trial so that results also can come out soon," she said, adding the sample size has to be at least 1,500 in total from all clinical sites.Patients are being enrolled in several countries in these clinical trials to generate enough strong evidence on their efficacy to treat COVID-19 patients, Godbole said."The Solidarity Trial aims to rapidly discover whether any of the drugs slows the disease's progression or improves survival. Other drugs can be added based on emerging evidence," she said. Godbole further said the drug remdesivir and Interferon beta-1a have been provided by the global health body to India to conduct clinical trials. US-based pharma company Gilead Sciences has donated the antiviral drug to the WHO.Over 100 countries are working together to find effective therapeutics as soon as possible, via the Trial, according to the WHO website. The global data safety and monitoring boards will periodically be reviewing the trials and accordingly, inform the WHO.

09-05-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Nationwide tally touches 62,000; active cases stand at 39,834||The nationwide tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases crossed 62,700 on Saturday and the death toll topped the 2,000 mark after hundreds more tested positive for the deadly virus infection in several states, while worries mounted globally about re-emergence of the outbreak after reopening of locked down economies.Adding to the concerns, the fresh cases included at least two foreign returnees who had reached Kerala on May 7 in two separate first-day flights -- one from Dubai and another from Abu Dhabi -- under a massive ongoing evacuation plan of the central government to bring back stranded Indians abroad.While large numbers of cases continued to get detected in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Delhi, among other places, experts have warned the numbers may rise further in the coming days due to the ongoing movement of lakhs of migrant workers being facilitated by trains and buses to help them reach their native places and because of a large number of Indians stranded abroad, along with expatriates, being brought back in special flights.Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the two new cases in his state is a warning for all states to be on an alert to strengthen their "mitigation efforts and preventive measures." Many more similar flights from abroad are reaching Kerala and several other states over the next few days under what is being called the 'Vande Bharat' mission.In its daily update, the Union Health Ministry said the COVID-19 death toll has risen to 1,981 and the number of cases has climbed to 59,662, registering an increase of 95 deaths and 3,320 cases in 24 hours till Saturday morning.The number of active COVID-19 cases stood at 39,834, while 17,846 people have recovered and one patient has migrated, it said.However, a PTI tally of numbers reported by different states and UTs, as of 10.45 PM, showed at least 62,761 confirmed cases across the country, nearly 19,000 recoveries and 2,028 deaths. This showed an increase of over 6,000 confirmed cases since Friday morning.On Saturday, fresh cases were also reported from Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Punjab, Bihar and Assam, among other places.The health ministry said it has decided to deploy central teams in 10 states that have witnessed or are witnessing high COVID-19 cases to assist their health departments to facilitate management of the outbreak.Earlier, 20 central teams of public health experts were earlier sent to highly-affected districts on May 3, while a high-level team was recently deputed in Mumbai to support Maharashtra's efforts in COVID-19 response and management.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the testing capacity for COVID-19 has been ramped up to around 95,000 tests per day and a total of over 15 lakh tests have been conducted so far across hundreds of government and private labs.Globally, nearly 40 lakh people have tested positive for the deadly virus since its emergence in China last December, while approximately 2.75 lakh people have lost their lives. However, nearly 13 lakh people have recovered too, including nearly 2 lakh in the US and over 1.4 lakh in Germany.Germany and South Korea are among those countries that have been seen as having successfully avoided large number of deaths by their extensive testing and contact tracing measures. But, worries mounted on Saturday about fresh outbreaks in both the countries following various lockdown relaxations, thus raising the risks associated with reopening of economies.In India also, some relaxations have been given from the nationwide lockdown, which has been in place since March 25 and is scheduled to end on May 17 as of now.The Goa government may allow holding of music classes and reopening of some state-run libraries in a phased manner on the condition of maintaining strict social distancing norms, the state's Art and Culture Minister Govind Gawade said on Saturday. Goa is classified as a green zone with no coronavirus positive case as of now.But the ongoing lockdown is also estimated to have hit the economies hard with several experts forecasting zero to very low GDP growth for the current fiscal, while a few have even forecast a decline in the GDP if the lockdown restrictions continue longer.While fuel prices have already been hiked, an industry body of real estate developers said cement and steel rates have increased by 40-50 per cent in the last few weeks and alleged price cartelisation and unfair trade practices by their manufacturers.Some industrial establishments have begun opening their facilities as per the available relaxations. Among other companies, Hyundai Motor India said its Chennai-based manufacturing facility rolled out 200 cars on the first day of resuming production on Friday.Tamil Nadu reported four more deaths during the day, taking its death toll to 44, while 526 more people tested positive for the virus to take its tally to over 6,500.In Maharashtra, 1,165 new cases were reported to take the state tally to 20,228, while the death toll rose to 779 after 48 more patients succumbed to COVID-19. Mumbai alone reported 27 more deaths, taking its count of fatalities to 489, while the count of confirmed cases in the country's financial capital has risen to 12,864.Gujarat reported 394 new cases, taking its tally to 7,797, while 23 more patients died to take the death toll to 472. Ahmedabad alone reported 280 new cases and 20 more deaths, taking its own case count to 5,540 and fatalities to 363.In the national capital also, 224 new COVID-19 cases were recorded to take its tally to 6,542.In Delhi, there was also confusion over the death toll as the data from the four hospitals showed more fatalities than the number reported by the Delhi government, but Delhi's Health Minister Satyendar Jain said there is no reason to hide anything and not a single case will go unaccounted for.He said the hospitals have not sent detailed death reports of patients with information such as reason of death, name and age etc, on the basis of which the COVID-19 health bulletin is updated. The health department has asked the hospitals to send the death reports and summaries at the earliest, so that the data can be promptly added to the bulletin.There has been a mismatch in the numbers of West Bengal also for several days with the state government's figures being lower than that of the Union Health Ministry.The country's largest paramilitary force CRPF also reported 62 fresh coronavirus infections on Saturday from a single Delhi-based unit, officials said.The total number of active cases in the 3.25 lakh-strong force now stands at 231. While two personnel have recovered, one has succumbed to the infection.Across all central paramilitary forces, at least 116 fresh coronavirus infections were reported on Saturday, taking the total number of positive personnel in these uniformed organisations to over 650, officials said.The five Central Armed Police Forces also issued directions for strict physical or social distancing measures, sanitisation and quarantine in their camps and offices after a concerned Union Home Minister Amit Shah reviewed these rising cases on Friday with the force chiefs.On the outskirts of the national capital, Noida reported its second COVID-19 death while its total cases rose to 216. The overall figure for Uttar Pradesh also rose with at least 163 new cases and eight fresh deaths.Rajasthan recorded 129 more cases and three more fatalities, while 41 new cases were detected in Karnataka too.In Bihar, five Bihar Military Police (BMP) personnel tested positive, taking the total number of COVID-19 cases in the state to 579. In Assam, a dental college student's test came positive.The Union Health Ministry has also revised its policy for discharge of COVID-19 patients under which only those developing severe illness or having compromised immunity will have to test negative through RT-PCR test before being discharged by a hospital.Moderate cases of COVID-19 and pre-symptomatic, mild and very mild cases need not undergo tests before being discharged after resolution of their symptoms.According to the rules till now, a patient was considered fit to be discharged if he or she tested negative on day 14 and then again in a span of 24 hours.
