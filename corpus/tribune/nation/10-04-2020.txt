10-04-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: CRPF, ITBP launch PPE, masks preparation units||Two Central Armed Police Forces—the CRPF and the ITBP—Friday said they have started making PPEs (personal protective equipment) and face masks for COVID-19 frontline warriors of the country.They said they have deployed specialised machines and manpower at their bases in and around the national capital for the purpose.The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the country’s largest paramilitary force with about 3.25 lakh personnel, has also brought in a large automated machine in a Delhi-based camp that can churn out up to about 1 lakh three-plier masks a day which can be ramped up to 2 lakh units, if adequate raw material is available.The three-plier mask made by the machine will cost only Rs 5 per piece compared to Rs 15 in the market, a senior CRPF officer said.He added that the northern sector office of the force has also deployed a team of its tailors and other professionals who will prepare 500-1,000 hand-made cloth masks in a day and 400-500 PPEs per day.The force is also preparing a PPE kit, that covers a healthcare worker or any frontline person working in the virus infected environment from head to toe, with a special lamination cover and all accessories.This PPE kit is worth Rs 450 per set, he said.A similar initiative has been launched by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) at its supply and support battalion in Saboli near Sonipat (Haryana).“We are preparing PPEs that will cost about Rs 100 and hand-made three-layer masks for Rs 5,” an ITBP official said.“We have already prepared more than 1,000 PPEs and 2,000 masks till now and are enhancing the production,” he said.The ITBP can produce 200 PPEs and 500 masks per day, he said.The two forces are working to supplement these essential healthcare equipment as the cases of COVID-19 in the country are increasing every day and the supply and wear and tear rate of used masks and PPEs is to be taken care of, a senior Home Ministry official said.

10-04-2020||London||Vijay Mallya gets bankruptcy reprieve from UK High Court||In a relief to liquor baron Vijay Mallya, the High Court in London has deferred hearings on a plea by the SBI-led consortium of Indian banks, seeking the indebted tycoon to be declared bankrupt to enable them recover a loan of around 1.145 billion pounds from him.Justice Michael Briggs of the insolvency division of the High Court granted relief to Mallya, ruling that he should be given time till his petitions to the Supreme Court of India and his settlement proposal before the Karnataka High Court be determined, allowing him time to repay his debts to the banks in full.Chief Insolvency and Company Court judge Briggs, in his verdict delivered Thursday, said there is no obvious advantage to the banks to pursue this class action at this point in time.“This bankruptcy petition is by any measure extraordinary. The banks are pressing for a bankruptcy order at a time when there are extant proceedings in India,” read the judgment.“In my judgment the banks are secured, at least in part… The hearing of the petition should be adjourned for the purpose of amendment and for time to pay the debts in full,” it noted.A consortium of Indian public sector banks led by the State Bank of India had sought a bankruptcy order against Mallya as part of efforts to recoup around GBP 1.145 billion of unpaid loans from Mallya.Judge Briggs had reserved his judgment after hearing arguments from both sides in December last year over the loans to Mallya’s now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.In his judgment, the judge concluded that the legal cases being pursued by Mallya in India stood a reasonable prospect of success.“Although the petition to the Supreme Court and proposal before the Karnataka High Court are not guaranteed to succeed, they are genuine. The evidence supports the view that the petitions stand a reasonable prospect of success,” he said.According to the court document, the judgment on the bankruptcy petition was produced in December last year and circulated in January this year but its handing-down was adjourned for further argument at the request of the parties.“The parties agreed to a hearing after 1 June 2020. The outbreak of Covid-19 has made fixing a date uncertain. In my judgment it is in the interests of the administration of justice and in the public interest that this judgment be handed down now,” the ruling noted.While the banks had argued for a bankruptcy order to ensure they receive what is owed to them amid a multiplicity of creditors, Mallya’s lawyers stressed that the Indian banks were identified as secured creditors by Indian courts, which makes the bankruptcy petition in the UK court unfair.“Why should we take less than everything we are owed,” said Marcia Shekerdemian, the barrister for the Indian banks, referring Mallya’s settlement offers.During the hearing last year, the court had also heard that the banks do not accept the former Kingfisher Airlines boss’ assertion that most of his assets are in India and to a lesser extent worldwide.A villa in France and assets spread across the British Virgin Islands, a trust registered in the Caribbean nation of St Kitts & Nevis and the Indian Empress superyacht in Malta were some of Mallya’s worldwide assets referred to during the course of the hearing.  Mallya’s legal team, led by barrister Philip Marshall, sought dismissal of the bankruptcy petition, arguing that their client was being unfairly pursued by the banks in India and the UK on opposite grounds.“Payment has been inhibited by virtue of the intervention by the Enforcement Directorate of India… the banks are seeking a bankruptcy order against Dr Mallya for non-payment but have created a situation where he can’t make a payment,” Marshall told the court.A previous UK High Court ruling had refused to overturn a worldwide order freezing Mallya’s assets and upheld an Indian court’s ruling that the consortium of 13 Indian banks were entitled to recover funds amounting to nearly GBP 1.145 billion.The banks then launched efforts to recover dues as part of the freezing order, with the bankruptcy petition aimed at seizing UK-based Mallya’s assets to recover the dues. Meanwhile, Mallya remains on bail pending a UK High Court ruling in the extradition proceedings brought by India in relation to charges of fraud and money laundering amounting to an alleged Rs 9,000 crores.

The vehicles are owned by the Wadhawan brothers, the notice said.The Wadhawan brothers and 21 others, including their family members, were travelling in two Range Rover and three Toyota Fortuner cars.Meanwhile, anti-corruption probe agency CBI has asked Satara district authorities to not release Wadhawan brothers from COVID-19 quarantine without its approval as they face non-bailable warrants in the Yes Bank fraud case, the agency said in a statement.The brothers are named as accused in the CBI FIR pertaining to swindling of money by Yes Bank former CEO Rana Kapoor and other accused, it said.The CBI said Kapil and Dheeraj were absconding since the case was registered on March 7 prompting the agency to get Non-Bailable Warrants against them from a special court, it said.The CBI release said, “The agency had received information on Thursday about their location at a government quarantine centre in Panchgani following which the CBI dispatched an email to Satara District Magistrate asking him to not release them without an NOC from the CBI”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yes-bank-case-ed-attaches-vehicles-of-dhfl-promoters-wadhawans-69300

The Supreme Court in 2026 had directed the CBI to upload all the new FIRs on its official website within 24 hours and in case of those having sensitive in nature and also with bearing on ongoing probe needed to be posted within 72 hoursSources said in the given scenario it could be difficult for the agency to file chargesheets in the stipulated 90-day period in special crimes under the Indian Penal Code and within the requisite 60-day limit for filing chargesheets in anti-corruption cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act.Once the lockdown and related restrictions are lifted post-containment of the viral disease that has hit almost each and every country around the globe, it will be difficult for the sleuths to wrap up probe and the agency may be bound to seek extensions from related courts to pursue the investigation, said sources.Sources said the officials are finding it difficult in Processing of Letters Rogatory (judicial requests) and notices under the Interpol, which could lead to delays in moving further in probe in a few cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-lockdown-impact-cbi-has-not-filed-a-single-fir-in-past-20-days-69299

10-04-2020||---||‘We will need to work together’: UN Security Council discusses COVID-19 pandemic||New Delhi, April 10. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a ceasefire among warring parties in different parts of the world and cautioned the world of the threat of terrorist groups exploiting the diversion of attention of most governments to battling the Covid-19 epidemic. The weakness of the global community in handling the epidemic reflects the world’s lack of preparedness in case of a bio-terrorist attack, he pointed out in an address to the first meeting of the UN Security Council on the epidemic.In a broadside at China which resisted the convening of UNSC on grounds that the Covid epidemic was a purely a health issue, Guterres said the engagement by the world’s premier body will be “critical” to mitigate the peace and security implications of Covid.“Indeed, a signal of unity and resolve would count for a lot at this anxious time,” observed the UN Secretary-General, against the backdrop of a tussle between China and the US.China says the epidemic is a global challenge and appreciates the role of the WHO and the UN in this regard. In an effort to stave off criticism about holding back information about the spread of the virus in Heibei Province, China points out that it is currently helping out 100 countries combat the virus.The US has attacked WHO for helping China suppress information early on in the spread of the virus, a mistake for which the world is paying a heavy price.“To prevail against the pandemic today, we will need to work together. That means heightened solidarity,’’ reiterated Guterres at the closed-door meeting with UNSC members.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-will-need-to-work-together-un-security-council-discusses-covid-19-pandemic-69292
10-04-2020||New Delhi||Private airport operators seek government’s help claiming 2 lakh jobs at stake||Claiming to have been severely impacted by the lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 spread, private airport operators have sought the government’s helping hand claiming that around two lakh jobs are at stake.Seeking a bailout package from the Centre, the Association of Private Airport Operators (APAO) in a communication to the government said this would not only help in keeping the workforce afloat but also in maintaining the key infrastructure assets.It went on to add that currently the sector employs approximately 2,40,000 people  and their jobs are at risk.Consequently, downsizing will have an impact on the already strained sector. This will be felt across the country as New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad are some of the major airports which are handled by private entities.The APAO said in the present situation foreign and domestic passenger flight operations have been halted till April 14 and only cargo operations are taking place at the facilities, which is hitting the bottom lines of the companies that operate the airports.It, in its representation to the government, argued that not only is the income low but the operators are also in stress to pay up their huge chunk of the revenue to the government under the various management deals.Quoting APAO Secretary General Satyan Nayar, a spokesperson of Delhi airport said, “We have approached the government requesting to immediately provide certain relief measures for the private airport operators, which will directly alleviate the financial burden for airports due to the COVID-19 outbreak.”“In the absence of any relief measures it is just a matter of days and not months that the operators might go in for a massive downturn to contain costs. This sector won’t be able to sustain the manpower, it does right now,” Nayar said.Accordingly the APAO has sought deferment of taxes and other statutory dues, and one time waiver of revenue share being paid to state run partner entities (AAI) and also lending lifelines to maintain and keep ready these critical facilities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/private-airport-operators-seek-governments-help-claiming-2-lakh-jobs-at-stake-69291

Around 250 of them who had tested positive for Corona virus were not airlifted.The petition pointed out that India brought back her citizens from other countries but didn't make any effort to evacuate the stranded Indians from gulf region.As the host countries wanted to take care of their citizens first, the Indian migrant workers were not being given treatment even after many of them tested positive for COVID19, the PIL alleged."The migrant workers in the Gulf countries are being denied treatment in hospitals even after testing positive for COVID-19 and are told to stay back in their house or camp itself. This is because the number of patients who are getting infected is going up, there is a shortage of beds in government hospitals," the PIL read.In the absence of testing and treatment facilities, there was a high risk of COVID-19 transmission among migrant Indian workers as they lived in cramped conditions, it said, adding that their condition was worsening day by dayThe PIL demanded financial aid to those migrant workers in Gulf countries who lost their jobs due to outbreak of COVID-19.Maintaining that the government was under constitutional obligation to protect these Indian migrant workers in this extraordinary time "which has threatened the very existence of the human race," the PIL sought directions to the Centre to ensure that adequate food, medicines, quarantine and emergency service facilities were made available to them.Meanwhile, senior advocate Vibha Datta Makhija and advocate Kashish Aneja on Friday filed a separate PIL seeking a direction to the Centre to arrange special flights to airlift Indian citizens stranded in the US.While appreciating the government's decision to impose a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID19, they said a blanket ban on international flights has put the Indian citizens in the US in great difficulty.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19%C2%A0-pil-in-sc-seeks-evacuation-of-indian-migrant-workers-stranded-in-gulf-nations-69286
10-04-2020||New York||Facebook sues Indian techie for running deceptive ads, fake news on coronavirus||Facebook has filed a lawsuit against an Indian man for running a software company that pushed deceptive advertisements and misinformation about the coronavirus outbreak on social media platforms by bypassing its advertising review process.The suit, filed in federal court in California, alleges that Basant Gajjar's company LeadCloak provided ad-cloaking software designed to sneak fake news and scams related to COVID-19, cryptocurrency, diet pills and more past Facebook and Instagram's automated advertising review process.          Using the name “LeadCloak,” Gajjar, said to be based in Thailand, violated Facebook Terms and Policies by providing cloaking software and services designed to circumvent automated ad review systems, and ultimately run deceptive ads on Facebook and Instagram, Jessica Romero, Director of Platform Enforcement and Litigation at Facebook said in a statement.LeadCloak's software also targeted a number of other technology companies including Google, Oath, WordPress, Shopify, and others, Romero said.Cloaking is a malicious technique that impairs ad review systems by concealing the nature of the website linked to an ad. When ads are cloaked, a company's advertisement review system may see a website showing an innocuous product such as a sweater, but a user will see a different website, promoting deceptive products and services which, in many cases, are not allowed.In this case, Leadcloak's software was used to conceal websites featuring scams related to global health crisis COVID-19, cryptocurrency, pharmaceuticals, diet pills, and fake news pages. Some of these cloaked websites also included images of celebrities, the social media giant said in the statement. In addition to the filing, Facebook has taken technical enforcement measures against Leadcloak and accounts that the company has determined have used their software, including disabling personal and ad accounts on Facebook and Instagram. This suit will also further our efforts to identify Leadcloak's customers and take additional enforcement actions against them, the statement added.

10-04-2020||New Delhi||India in final stages of framing protocols for clinical trial of plasma therapy: ICMR||India is in the final stages of framing a protocol for conducting clinical trial for convalescent plasma therapy, which uses antibodies from the blood of cured patients, to treat severely-ill COVID-19 patients, a senior ICMR official said.Kerala is set to become the first state in the country to commence the therapy to treat those critically-ill on a trial basis. The ICMR is learnt to have given its nod to the state government for the first of its kind project, initiated by the prestigious Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), a top official had said.The ICMR official on Thursday said they would need approval from Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) before embarking on any clinical trial using the therapy.He said that it is not currently used or prescribed for patients in India. "We are in the final stages of making a protocol for convalescent plasma therapy and after that we will need approval from the DCGI. As of now it will be used only in clinical trials," he said, adding that the therapy was successful in limited clinical trials in some countries on patients who were in a severe condition or on ventilator support.The death toll due to the novel coronavirus rose to 199 and the number of cases climbed to 6,412 in the country on Friday, according to the Union Health Ministry.However, a PTI tally of figures reported by various states as on Thursday late evening showed at least 6,640 cases and 227 deaths.There has been a difference in the Union Health Ministry figures compared to the number of cases announced by different states which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states.

10-04-2020||New Delhi||IIT Ropar develops UV technology to sanitise grocery items, currency notes||The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) has developed a trunk-shaped device fitted with ultraviolet germicidal irradiation technology, which they recommend be placed at doorsteps and all items brought from outside including grocery and currency notes be put in it to sanitise them and aid the fight against COVID-19.According to the team at IIT Ropar, the trunk when commercialised, can be available at less than Rs 500. The device will take 30 minutes to sanitise the items and the team has recommended a 10 minute cooling off period before one takes the items out."The fight against corona pandemic, will not end just with social distancing and not stepping out. In coming days and weeks, it will be extremely important to be cautious with everything possible. We have developed a device which looks like any trunk in our home, and we recommend it be placed at doorsteps or may be somewhere closer to the entry."Right now there are many who wash vegetables with warm water before using but the same cannot be done with currency notes or wallets. So we have developed a common sanitising solution for everything," Naresh Rakha, Senior Scientific Officer at IIT Ropar, told PTI.The team recommends that all items coming from outside including currency notes, vegetables, milk packets, any items ordered through delivery, wrist watch, wallets, mobile phones or any documents be placed in the trunk before being used."The device is based on ultraviolet germicidal irradiation technology used in water purifiers. We strongly advise not to look directly at the light inside the trunk as it can be harmful," Rakha said.According to the Union Health Ministry, the death toll due to the novel coronavirus rose to 199 and the number of cases to 6,412 in the country on Friday, While the number of active COVID-19 cases is 5,709, as many as 503 people were cured and discharged and one had migrated, it said.The ministry said at least 30 new deaths have been reported since Thursday evening.

10-04-2020||New Delhi||Enough stock of hydroxychloroquine in India: Govt||The government on Friday said that there is enough stock of hydroxychloroquine in the country and it is taking all steps to ensure that there is no shortage of the drug in the domestic market.India is the biggest manufacturer of the anti-malarial drug that is being touted as ‘game changer’ in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.“There is enough stock of hydroxychloroquine in the country and we are tracking its demand, availability and production on a daily basis,” National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) Chairman Shubhra Singh told PTI.India is the world’s largest manufacturer of the drug, which is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, malaria and lupus, she added.“Ensuring the availability of the drug in the country is our first priority. Only after meeting the demand here, the exports are being done,” Singh said.She, however, cautioned that the medicine should only be taken on the advice of doctors.India manufactures 70 per cent of the world’s supply of hydroxychloroquine. Companies like IPCA and Zydus Cadila are the major manufacturers of hydroxychloroquine in the country.The Indian pharmaceutical industry earlier this week said there is enough stock of hydroxychloroquine in the country and drug firms are ready to ramp up the production to meet domestic as well as export requirements.India currently has an annual installed capacity of around 40 tonnes of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) of hydroxychloroquine. With this capacity, it can make around 200 million tablets of 200 mg, which can be ramped up, the Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association (IDMA) had said.The production capacity in the country is sufficient to meet the current demand. If the need arises, the companies are committed to ramp up production, the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance had earlier told PTI.India on Tuesday had decided to partially lift the ban on the export of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine in sync with its global commitment to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/enough-stock-of-hydroxychloroquine-in-india-govt-69267

Its impact has been extraordinary across the globe, including India," he said in a video message to all Navy personnel.        The danger posed by this disease is real, imminent and unprecedented, he noted.India is under a 21-day lockdown till April 14 to curb the coronavirus pandemic. "We need to double our efforts to ensure that our personnel and their families continue to remain safe...We also have to make sure that our operational assets, especially ships and submarines, remain free from the virus," Singh said. "It is a very difficult task as physical-distancing on ships and submarines is a challenge...I would also request you to wear your masks at all times," he noted. Singh listed the steps that were taken by the Indian Navy to deal with the virus such as stopping the recruitment, putting a halt on transfers and movements of sailors and officers, and changing the training set up. Around 13 lakh people have been infected globally and more than 70,000 deaths have occurred due to the virus. "These are difficult times. Many of you are separated from your families. Some personnel's parents are in villages and they need help...But I can say with satisfaction that our personnel and our community has risen to the occasion proactively," he said. "Our ships and aircraft are on standby to support the government and civil administration. We are ready to extend support not only to our country but to Indian Ocean region nations, island territories of our country," the navy chief said.The COVID-19 challenge is not over and it is only going to intensify in the days and weeks ahead, he said, adding that the Navy will be required to further augment its preparedness.  Large scale disinfection of public areas, supporting movement between states, being ready to assist local law and order, preparing makeshift vehicles for medical support, establishing quick response teams that can do contact tracing of the naval community as the COVID-19 positive cases rise—these are the steps that Navy would have to take, said Singh. "We need to be ready for the worst-case scenario. And to my mind, it is going to be a long battle. We have decided that once the lockdown is over, the movement of personnel will happen in a coordinated manner. We should not do the movements in rush," he said. "If the situation worsens, we will have to be ready to create alternate areas where mass isolation and quarantine can be done," he noted.

10-04-2020||New Delhi/Noida||No slots available: Bigbasket, Grofers fail to deliver essentials in Delhi-NCR||With the state governments ring-fencing 22 corona hotspots in Noida, 13 in Ghaziabad, 9 in Gurugram and 25 in Delhi, the NCR region went through an unprecedented frenzy over the supply of essential items on Friday, with leading online delivery platforms Bigbasket, Grofers and Milkbasket once again failing to rise to the occasion as 21-day lockdown entered its final phase."Unfortunately, we do not have any available slots to service you right now. Please try again later," was the message Arun Kumar, a Noida resident, received from Bigbasket. Kumar has been trying incessantly for the past few days to get an online delivery.In its latest operational update, Bigbasket said: "We are reporting slot availability across cities each day. We have been working hard to ensure that we are able to service you over the next few weeks".Angry users blasted the delivery platform on the operational update."Tell something new... Every time same updates to fool people. And no slots available in reality," posted Aru.Another user replied to Bigbasket: "What the hell! Everyday I am checking it is saying all slots are filled."The Grofers' story was no different."Where is my refund.. u guys cancelled my order to take new order in hiked price.. atleast refund money asap so that u can get stuff from offline," Shaktiprasad tweeted to Grofers.Ajay Kumar tweeted: "I am trying to place the order with Grofers from last 16 days but it's not accepting my order, what I am getting is assurance only, dropped mail but no +ve response receiving"."We received delivery but not what we ordered," said one BBDaily user from Noida Sector 143 which is not a hotspot.The state governments had claimed to ensure people that essentials like groceries, vegetables, milk, medicines and others will be brought to the doorsteps of the people in hotspots.The news also led to panic buying and stockpiling of groceries in Noida and adjoining areas as long queues were seen outside the grocery stores.The telephone numbers that the Noida authorities provided were either switched off or out of order for many.Several Noida users, who were not in the designated hotspot zones, were equally affected."Apologies for the trouble, due to unprecedented order booking, you may not find slots. We are doing our best to create more capacity. We'll update the slot availability status on our app and website every day. Do keep checking them every now and then for updates," was the message on most of the online delivery platforms.Several Milkbasket users were left clueless as they did not get deliveries in their societies which were not sealed."Dear customer, in our attempt to comply with heightened measures in and around certain zones in the city, we will not be able to service your society until further notice. We can understand the inconvenience it might cause and deeply regret it," was the message people living in several Noida societies received which were not sealed.

10-04-2020||Jerusalem||In a test of faith, Christians mark Good Friday in isolation||Christians are commemorating Jesus' crucifixion without the solemn church services or emotional processions of past years, marking Good Friday in a world locked down by the coronavirus pandemic.A small group of clerics are to hold a closed-door service in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, built on the site where Christians believe Jesus was crucified, buried and rose from the dead. They will then walk the Via Dolorosa, the ancient route where he is believed to have carried the cross before his execution at the hands of the Romans.In ordinary times, tens of thousands of pilgrims from around the world retrace Jesus' steps in the Holy Week leading up to Easter. But this year, flights are grounded and religious sites in the Holy Land are closed as authorities try to prevent the spread of the virus.The new virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks. But it is highly contagious and can be spread by those showing no symptoms. It can cause severe illness and death in some patients, particularly the old and infirm.In Rome, the torch-lit Way of the Cross procession at the Colosseum is a highlight of Holy Week, drawing large crowds of pilgrims, tourists and locals. It's been cancelled this year, along with all other public gatherings in Italy, which is battling one of the worst outbreaks.The virus has killed nearly 18,000 people in Italy and over 88,000 worldwide.Instead of presiding over the Way of the Cross procession, Pope Francis will lead a Good Friday ceremony in St. Peter's Square without the public.Ten people — five from the Vatican's health office and five from a prison in Padua, in northern Italy, where infections are particularly widespread — will participate in the procession, which will circle several times around the obelisk in St. Peter's Square.On display in the square will be a wooden crucifix, famed for being carried in a procession during the plague that ravaged Rome in the early 16th century.The Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, nearly destroyed by fire a year ago, is holding a special Good Friday ceremony in the charred, gutted interior of the medieval landmark. But the event is closed to the public for two reasons: France's strict virus confinement measures forbid religious or any other gatherings, and the cathedral remains too structurally unstable to let parishioners inside.“We wanted to send a message of hope” through the ceremony, Paris Archbishop Michel Aupetit told reporters this week.“The message of hope is especially important for our compatriots at a time when we are particularly affected by the coronavirus, which is sowing anguish and death,” he said.In the Philippines, Asia's bastion of Catholicism, masses and other solemn gatherings have been put on hold, including folk rituals that feature real-life crucifixions and usually draw thousands of tourists and penitents. The annual procession of the “Black Nazarene,” a centuries-old statue of Jesus, through downtown Manila, has also been canceled.Churchgoers have been told to stay home and remember Jesus' suffering through family prayers, fasting and by watching masses and religious shows on TV or online.For Josille Sabsal, it's a test of faith. The 30-year-old Catholic missionary tried to replicate an altar in her Manila home by setting up a laptop, a crucifix and small statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary on a table.“It's different, because the priest is on a screen," she said. "When the internet lags, the mass suddenly gets cut off and you have to look for another YouTube video.” “I miss that moment in church when you say, 'Peace be with you,' to complete strangers and they smile back," she added.The Rev. Flavie Villanueva, a former drug addict who ministers in Manila's slums, got special permission to celebrate Mass on Thursday for 73 homeless people in a college basketball court. They wore masks, stayed more than an arm's length apart, and there was no singing.He's sad to see the churches emptied out, but hopes it will help people to renew their faith."We are asked to go back and rediscover where the church in our lives first started, and that's in the family.” — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-a-test-of-faith-christians-mark-good-friday-in-isolation-69252

The doctor asked the cops to keep the notes separately for 24 hours.The residents of the Paper Mill Colony, meanwhile, remained locked in discussion till well past midnight. The residents, while maintaining social distancing, discussed the 'threat of corona through currency notes' till the police asked them to return to their homes.In normal times, the 500-rupee notes would not have remained on the road for long. Any passersby would have quietly picked up the same and walked away without a word.According to a police official, the panic, on Thursday night, was created by a WhatsApp video that has been doing the rounds.In the video, when the son responds to the doorbell and opens the door, he finds a Rs 500 note lying on the doormat outside. He quickly shuts the door and informs his mother, who is flabbergasted.The son wears his protective gear, picks up the sanitiser bottle, cautiously opens the door and sprays ample sanitiser on the currency note. Then he slowly pushes the note to the neighbour's door and retreats into his flat.The video seeks to confirms the belief that coronavirus is being spread through the currency notes too.However, no action has yet been taken to track the video. Meanwhile, the two Rs 500 notes continue to remain with the police.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-rs-500-notes-create-panic-in-lucknow-locals-say-money-thrown-on-road-to-spread-coronavirus-69250

10-04-2020||Shahira Naim||UP govt takes action against those spreading fake news||Tribune News ServiceLucknow, April 10To check the dangers of fake news spreading communal hatred in Uttar Pradesh during the COVID-19 pandemic, the state government has already registered 78 cases until Thursday against those spreading fake news on the social media, said additional chief secretary Avanish Awasthi.Speaking to reporters, he said that of these 24 cases were against users of Facebook, an equal number of cases against Twitter users, a dozen cases against WhatsApp users and 18 cases against TikTok users.The situation has become explosive, as fake news, regarding the behaviour of Tablighi Jamaat people who are recovering from COVID 19 or are under quarantine has caused much heartburn and tension.When Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath interacted with more than 300 leaders of all religious denominations on April 5, one of the requests he had was to convince their respective followers to unitedly fight the virus and abstain from spreading fake news to poison the atmosphere.Uttar Pradesh DGP H C Awasthi also admitted that even the central government had directed them to keep an eye on fake news on the social media and take appropriate action against the guilty.Fake news instances1.  News appeared in a section of the media that in Rampur quarantined Tablighi Jamaat persons had demanded non vegetarian food and had defecated in the open. The Saharanpur police investigated the matter and found it completely wrong. It advised the media to check facts before reporting.2.  A heated exchange at a teashop in Prayagraj led to one person being killed. It was reported that the accused was a Jamaati who had fired at the victim as he had charged him with spreading the disease. The accused had nothing to do with the Jamaat, clarified the police.3.  Even a news channel used by political leaders to give exclusive news bytes is guilty. In a tweet, DCP Noida charged it with misquoting him. “UP people who had come in contact with the positive case were quarantined as per laid procedure. There was no mention of Tablighi Jamaat. You are misquoting and spreading fake news.”4.  In Bareilly, the police enforced lockdown when they found some youths playing cards on the street. Later, a group of 70-80 youths attacked the police station injuring the ASP and other police officers alleging that the police had injured a youth. The police baton-charged to disperse the violent crowd. Medical examination found the youth feigning injury. Newspapers reported that Tablighi Jamaat attacked the police when it was enforcing lockdown. The SSP had to clarify that this was untrue.5.  Another leading national news channel tweeted that Tablighi Jamaat corona positive persons had pelted a health team with stones in Firozabad. The Firozabad police directed the news channel to delete the tweet as the news was untrue as there had not been any attack on any medical team or ambulance in Firozabad.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-govt-takes-action-against-those-spreading-fake-news-69248

10-04-2020||Vibha Sharma||Covid-19 lockdown positive spin-off: Clean air may have saved many lives across world||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 10The deadly and economy-dilapidating corona lockdown has had some positive, rather pleasant spin-offs as well. While a couple of days back people in Jalandhar woke up to the breathtaking view of snow-clad Dhauladhar range in far-off Himachal because of low air pollution in two states, here in a pollution hot-spot of Delhi people are breathing a lot easier because of a far better air quality.Air pollution levels have dipped remarkably across the country, including places where earlier people were gasping for breath. There is no proof on numbers but expectedly, and logically, low pollution levels and good air quality could be helping save lives across the world with many environmentalists now suggesting a limited lockdown every year to help nature recover. While a link between pollution and death/serious illness from coronavirus was suspected, a recent Harvard analysis has also shown a “large overlap” between deaths from COVID-19 and long-term exposure to fine particulate matter, the more deadly PM 2.5 variety. According to this study, a person exposed to high levels of fine PM is 15 per cent more likely to die from coronavirus than someone to lower levels.  The results hold additional value for a country like India where exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollution is said to have contributed to over 1.2 million deaths in 2017. A study titled "State of Global Air 2019", released around the same time last year, said that life on average of a South Asian child growing in current high levels of air pollution will be shortened by two years and six months, while the global life expectancy loss is 20 months. From smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a major threat not just to health but also to climate. According to the World Health Organisation, air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year. As per WHO, nine out of 10 people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants. The combined effects of ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution cause about seven million premature deaths every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections, it says.More than 80% of people living in urban areas that monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed WHO guideline limits, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures, both indoors and outdoors. Now, according to this Harvard study, coronavirus patients in places with high levels of air pollution before the pandemic are more likely to die from the infection than patients in cleaner parts of the USA. “The results of this paper suggest that long-term exposure to air pollution increases vulnerability to experiencing the most severe COVID -19 outcomes,” the authors have been quoted as saying. The paper, which is expected to aid public health officials allocate resources like ventilators and respirators in affected areas, has been submitted for peer review and publication in the New England Journal of Medicine, as per reports.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-lockdown-positive-spin-off-clean-air-may-have-saved-many-lives-across-world-69240

More than 700 have been cured and discharged.However, the evening update from the Union Health Ministry put the number of confirmed infections at 6,761 and the death toll at 206.Maharashtra has reported the maximum 1,574 cases, including close to 1,000 in Mumbai itself, while over 100 have died in the state. Tamil Nadu and Delhi have crossed the 900-mark in terms of positive cases, Rajasthan has over 500 now, while Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have reported more than 400 positive cases each. Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat are also fast approaching the 400-mark, while Kerala has also reported over 300 cases already.More than 200 cases have been reported by each of Karnataka and Jammu & Kashmir, while the 100-mark has been breached already by West Bengal, Haryana and Punjab.States gear up to extend lockdownSeveral places including Delhi and Mumbai reported further spread of the deadly virus and Punjab became the second state to extend the lockdown beyond April 14, a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets chief ministers to take stock of the situation.The Union Home Ministry also sought views of state governments on the 21-day lockdown including on whether more categories of people and services need to be exempted, officials said on Friday, amidst indications of a possible two-week extension of the nationwide restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus.The Health Ministry in the meantime maintained that no community transmission is taking place as yet in India, while the World Health Organisation also put the country in a category named ‘cluster of cases’—a notch below the community transmission stage and a classification used by the global body for cases “clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common exposures”.Later in the evening, WHO said that a hasty lifting of restrictions imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a fatal resurgence of the deadly virus, which has infected over 16 lakh people globally since its emergence in China last December while the worldwide death toll is fast approaching 1,00,000.While several states including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh reported rising number of cases, the Union Health Ministry said the rate of people testing positive was only 0.2 per cent on Thursday when more than 16,000 samples were tested. Cumulatively close to 1.5 lakh samples have been tested so far across India.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said most of the 27 positive cases reported in his state on Thursday—the maximum daily increase for the state—were those of secondary transmission and expressed apprehension that the state may be entering the community transmission stage of the outbreak.A day after Odisha decided to extend the lockdown till April 30, Punjab decided to continue the lockdown till May 1, while a decision by the central government on the nationwide lockdown, which entered its 17th day, is expected after Modi’s interaction with all chief ministers on Saturday.In Tamil Nadu, an expert committee recommended to Chief Minister K Palaniswami that the lockdown be extended by two weeks beyond April 14 considering the rise in number of cases.A review meeting was also held by the Prime Minister’s Office during the day on various efforts to check the coronavirus spread, which also discussed ramping up of production of personal protective equipments (PPEs) among other issues.The Home Ministry, separately, has sought views of state governments on the 21-day lockdown, scheduled to end on April 14, including whether more categories of people and services need to be exempted, officials said on Friday.Some of the suggestions made by state governments include allowing construction-related activities in rural areas.The central government, while imposing the lockdown, had announced that shops dealing in essential commodities, including the online platforms, will remain open, besides services like health, sanitation, police, media, agriculture and banking. Movements of essential and non-essential cargos were also allowed by the government, but there have been reports about disruptions in the supply chain due to lack of labourers and trucks, among other issues.There have also been reports of depleting levels of essential goods from various parts of the country.Some states such as Kerala have suggested phased opening of the lockdown, while other suggestions from various states include allowing liquor sale to shore up the revenues and to allow private vehicles on an odd-even basis. However, most states have suggested keeping the public road transport, rail and airline services suspended for more time. Many have also recommended keeping state borders sealed, except for goods movement.A few states have also suggested area-specific lockdown with stricter restrictions, which are as such being followed in the places identified as hotspots of the virus spread.In the meantime, more states including Odisha and Telangana made it mandatory for people to wear masks or face covers at public places, while enforcement was beefed up for action against those violating the lockdown conditions.The Centre also asked states not to allow religious gatherings and processions.Government officials also said that a decision on bringing Indians from abroad will be taken at a later stage after reviewing the COVID-19 situation.

But the determination to bring my son back overtook all my fears. I packed rotis and they kept me going. It was fearsome in the nights with no traffic movement and people on roads, the brave mother told PTI on Thursday.She is a government school headmistress from Bodhan town in Nizamabad district, about 200 kms from here.Razia, who lost her husband 15 years ago, had been living with her two sons, an engineering graduate, and 19-year old Nizamuddin, aspiring to join MBBS.He had gone to Rahamatabad in Nellore district on March 12 to drop his friend and stayed back there. Meanwhile, the lockdown was announced following the coronavirus outbreak and he could not return.Razia was anguished to hear from her son that he was desperate to join the family and decided to fetch him back herself. The woman did not send her elder son as she thought police might mistake him for a joy rider and detain him.After initially considering taking a car, she discarded the idea and chose her two-wheeler.On the morning of April 6, she began the journey and reached Nellore the next day afternoon. She left for home town on the same day along with her son and reached Bodhan on Wednesday evening, Razia said.She had packed 'rotis' to keep her from hunger pangs and rode on, making stops at fuel stations and quenching her thirst at certain points all along the way.Nizamuddin has completed his intermediate and has undergone coaching for the MBBS entrance exam.

He said there is little point in doing anti-bodies test at an early stage since in asymptomatic people it would not have a response.The level of training right from central to districts of doctors and nurses for standard protocols is adding to capacity of medical personnel, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/use-aarogya-setu-mobile-app-to-combat-covid-government-69070

The complete genome sequencing will help us determine whether the Covid19 virus has mutated in India and if yes, to what extent. The sequencing will also enable us to determine the route the virus took to India. That in turn will help us link lineages of patients in the country and respond accordingly,” Rakesh Mishra, Director of CCMB, Hyderabad, explained.He said research was also on to trace the source of the disease in Delhi’s biggest disease cluster at Nizamuddin.“The disease in the Nizamuddin cluster probably came from Malaysia. Having analysed samples from the site, we are conducting genome sequencing to find further links. As many as 3,000 genome sequences have been deposited in the public domain. By the next week we will know the source of Nizamuddin disease cluster,” Mishra said.Genome sequencing will help understand if there is anything unique about the virus circulating in India. Researchers have already concluded that the viral strain circulating in India is no less virulent than the one circulating in other nations like China, the US or Italy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-begins-genome-sequencing-69040
10-04-2020||---||Expert teams for nine states||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 9As Covid-19 cases in India reached 5,865 with 169 deaths, the Centre today readied a scheme fully funded by it to help state governments with emergency response and health system preparedness. High-level multidisciplinary teams for containment and hospital preparedness were stationed in nine most affected states, namely Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.Tata Sky, Airtel DTH to assist coachingNew Delhi: Tata Sky and Airtel DTH will air three educational SWAYAM PRABHA channels run by the Human Resource Development Ministry during the lockdown, the government announced on Thursday. Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said learners could continue learning sitting at home in this difficult situation, without any extra cost. PTIThe case count went up by 671 in the past 24 hours and deaths by 20, with 477 persons cured and discharged.In a letter to states, the Ministry of Health said the central scheme would cover expenses incurred on building hospitals and health systems across states to manage Covid-19, procurement of medical equipment, including personal protective gear, surveillance and purchase of masks, ventilators and ambulances. “Teams have been readied and sent to nine states.We have also written to states about the 100 per cent centrally funded scheme titled Covid Emergency Response and Health System Package for States,” Health Ministry spokesman Lav Agarwal said.Modalities of the scheme were finalised at a meeting of the Group of Ministers to review containment efforts and Covid-19 management challenges.The GoM advised against fear over the dearth of personal protective gear, besides stressing on their rational use. It also advised against misuse of hydroxychloroquine.“The GoM said fake news and fears around PPEs were unwarranted because not everyone would need the full PPE gear. While high-risk doctors would need full body suits, moderate-to-low-risk frontline heath workers would need N95 masks and gloves. The GoM took stock of the availability of essential medical equipment. Orders for 1.7 crore PPEs and 49,000 N95 masks have been placed and deliveries have started. As many as 30 domestic makers of PPEs have been matured for Covid response,” Agarwal said.The GoM also reviewed Covid test sample strategy and issued directions to increase test samples in disease clusters across the country. This augmentation would depend on 2.5 lakh test kits India has ordered for antibody (blood-based) tests from Singapore to test everyone with influenza-like illness in Covid hotspots. This supply has not yet arrived.The ICMR said supplies “are expected any time now”. As of today, India has tested 1.30 lakh samples with 5,865 positive. “The rate of positivity of the Covid virus has remained stable in India between 3 and 5 pc and has not increased significantly,” said the ICMR.In another move, the GoM directed that anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) should be used as per prescription and not by patients with cardiac irregularities. “The GoM was also informed that sufficient stock of hydroxychloroquine is being maintained in the country,” Agarwal said.First doctor to die an Indore physicianNew Delhi: The country on Thursday witnessed the first Covid-related death of a doctor who had tested positive due to exposure to a patient. The 62-year-old doctor died in Indore on Thursday. The victim, a general physician, had Covid symptoms but the authorities were yet to trace the patient he came in contact with.Third Dharavi death, lockdown tightenedMumbai: A 70-year-old Covid patient died in Mumbai’s Dharavi, one of the biggest slums in Asia. The death toll in the area has risen to three and the number of Covid cases to 14, following which lockdown has been tightened.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/expert-teams-for-nine-states-69039
