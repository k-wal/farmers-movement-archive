For hours, 500 buses have been held up at Uncha Nagla border. On the Delhi border, another 300 buses have reached. Please let these 879 buses proceed.”“Tomorrow, we will provide you a fresh list of 200 buses. Do verify that list as well. People are in pain and sad. We cannot delay any further,” said Priyanka in a tweet.The 1,000 buses being provided by Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for the returning UP workers clearly appears to have become a victim of a bitter political tug of war between the Congress and the CM Yogi led BJP government in Lucknow.In a day of swift developments, the CM Yogi-led BJP government launched a frontal attack on Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Sonia Gandhi charging it of playing politics by passing on registration numbers of private cars, two and three-wheelers and good carriers as that of buses.In a concerted exercise, Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma, rural development minister Mahendra Singh and MSME minister and government spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh held an impromptu press conference to attack Priyanka Gandhi and the Congress.The first press conference on Tuesday was of the cabinet minister and government spokesperson Singh, in which they charged the Congress of a ‘farziwada’ (scam) as the list of buses provided by them includes registration numbers of two and three-wheelers, private vehicles as well as a goods carrier.Singh alleged that the offer of 1,000 buses was a “political stunt” and demanded an explanation from Congress President Sonia Gandhi.According to him, preliminary scrutiny of the list of registration numbers of buses provided by the Congress party on Monday had revealed a scam as it includes the registration number of goods carriers, private vehicles, two-wheelers and three-wheelers.The minister said the registration numbers were being verified from the government of India portal.Refusing to answer a question about how many of the 1,000 registration numbers were of other vehicles, he said that the exercise to verify them was still going.Hitting out at the Congress, he alleged that the party was not concerned about the poor but only wanted to draw political mileage out of the whole issue.Responding to a question if the UP government would accept the offer of 1,000 buses of the AICC, he said as a responsible government it was our duty to first verify all documents, licenses, fitness certificates before it takes a final decision.Deputy CM Sharma demanded an apology from Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for playing a cruel joke with migrant workers.Earlier in the day, Additional Chief Secretary Avanish Awasthi had asked Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s private secretary to place 500 buses with the Ghaziabad district magistrate by 12 noon and another 500 buses with the Noida district magistrate.In his third letter, addressed to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s private secretary, he had asked for the Ghaziabad buses to be parked at Kaushambi and Sahibabad bus stations and the 500 Noida buses at a ground near the Expo Mart.The letter had pointed out that the concerned district magistrates would use the buses only after verifying the buses’ permits, fitness, insurance etc and drivers’ license and conductor’s papers.This letter was part of the nightlong ping-pong match of letters between the ACS Awasthi and Gandhi-Vadra’s private secretary Sachin Singh.After dilly-dallying for two days, on Monday evening, ACS Awasthi had responded to Priyanka’s letter of May 16 in which she had made the offer.In his reply addressed to her private secretary Sandeep Singh, Awasthi referred to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s May 16 letter and accepted the offer requesting a list of the names and contact details of the drivers and conductors of the buses.Within hours, Sandeep Singh responded to the letter by email in which he had attached the list of drivers and conductors as well as the registration number of the vehicles and had sought time to provide some additional details after re-verification.The UP government is now claiming that many of these vehicles are in fact, registered as private vehicles, good carriers, two, and three-wheelers.Singh had mentioned in his letter that he expected the UP government to put the buses in service by May 19 and make available the route of the buses and the timetable to the common people.However, ACS Awasthi wrote another letter to Singh referring to Singh’s earlier email. This according to Singh was mailed to him at 11.40 pm on May 18, 2020.In this second missive, Awasthi had also sought the fitness certificates of the buses, driver’s license, as well as full details of the conductors by 10 am along with the buses which were to reach Lucknow by 10 am.By 10 am on May 19, Awasthi had wanted all buses at Vrindavan Yojana, Sector 15-16, Lucknow, handed over to the District Magistrate of Lucknow.Responding to Awasthi’s second letter Singh in a letter written at 2.10 am on May 19, in which with due apologies Singh charged the move of being inspired by politics.“Aisa lagta nahi hai keh aapki sarkar vipda ke marey hamarey UP ke shramik bhai-behnon ki madad karna chahti hai” (It does not appear that your government wants to help our pandemic hit worker brothers and sisters of UP).In his letter, Singh points out that the media was continuously showing that lakhs of workers are stranded at various borders of UP, especially in Delhi-UP’s border areas such as Ghaziabad and Noida.“In a situation when thousands walked down to the UP border to get themselves registered at the centres,  taking 1000 empty buses to Lucknow is not just a waste of time and resources but the result of extreme inhumanness and the result of an anti-poor mind set,” he said in the letter.Refusing to budge from the earlier stand of helping stranded workers reach their homes Singh once again requested for route map and timetable to run the buses from the Ghazipur border in Ghaziabad and Noida border.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/upcc-president-arrested-fir-against-priyankas-private-secretary-over-factually-incorrect-list-of-buses-87020
19-05-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s private liquor shops likely to reopen from Friday||All private liquor shops in the national capital are likely to reopen from Friday as the Delhi Government has directed these outlets to submit their monthly stock record (MSR) by May 21.However, liquor shops in malls will remain closed in accordance with the government’s order, the excise department said.There are around 450 private liquor shops in Delhi which will be allowed to open on odd-even basis, it said.All government liquor vends have already been permitted to open in the city, except those in malls and containment zones.The order further states that owners of private liquor shops will have to give an undertaking that their outlets do not fall under COVID-19 containment zones.It also made it clear that the private liquor vends cannot open without conducting MSR activity.“Accordingly, all L-7 licensees (private liquor shops) are directed to conduct MSR activity between May 19 and May 21, 2020... Only after submission of the MSR compliance report and the undertaking, the shops will be allowed to open on odd-even basis,” the order also said.In case, any private shop is opened on the basis of false information, the license will be cancelled, it added.On May 4, the government had allowed the reopening of around 150 state-run liquor shops with the beginning of the third phase of coronavirus-forced lockdown, resulting in long queues at these outlets.Later, the government had introduced e-token system under which customers are given a specific date and time to buy liquor in order to avoid overcrowding and long queues.

19-05-2020||New Delhi||Rajkot, Indore, Navi Mumbai among Centre’s ‘5-star garbage-free’ cities; Delhi 3-star||The government on Tuesday released a rating of cities for their garbage management, giving the top ‘five-star garbage-free’ tag to six cities including Chhattisgarh’s Ambikapur and Madhya Pradesh’s Indore, while saying that the Swachh Bharat Mission has been the “greatest strength” in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri announced the results of garbage-free star rating for the cities.A total of 141 cities have been rated—six of them 5-star, 65 of three-star, 70 one-star.Apart from Ambikapur and Indore, Gujarat’s Rajkot and Surat, Karnataka’s Mysore and Maharashtra’s Navi Mumbai have been rated five-star.New Delhi, Haryana’s Karnal; Andhra Pradesh’s Tirupati and Vijayawada; Chandigarh; Chhattisgarh’s Bhilai Nagar; Gujarat’s Ahmedabad; MP’s Bhopal; and Jharkhand’s Jamshedpur are among ‘three-star garbage-free rating’, Puri said.Among the ‘one-star garbage free cities’ are: Delhi Cantonment, Rohtak (Haryana); Gwalior, Maheshwar, Khandwa, Badnawar and Hathod (all five in MP); and Gujarat’s Vadodara, Bhavnagar and Vyara.Puri said the importance of sanitation and effective solid waste management have been brought to the forefront now due to the COVID-19 crisis.“In fact, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the present (COVID) situation could have been much worse had it not been for the critical part that Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) has played in the last five years to ensure a high degree of cleanliness and sanitation in urban areas,” he said.The minister said that five years ago, the government introduced Swachh Survekshan (SS), an annual cleanliness survey, for urban India and it has proven immensely successful in improving urban cleanliness through a spirit of healthy competition.Housing and Urban Affairs Secretary Durga Shanker Mishra said 1,435 cities applied for the ‘Star Rating Assessment’.During the assessments, 1.19 crore citizen feedbacks and over 10 lakh geo-tagged pictures were collected and 5,175 solid waste processing plants were visited by 1,210 field assessors, he said.While 698 cities cleared the desktop assessment, 141 cities have been certified with Star Rating during field assessment.The low number of certifications signifies the rigorous and robust certification mechanism of the protocol, Mishra said.Puri said that under the Swachh Bharat Mission, while the government constructed lakhs of toilets, there has also been hygiene discipline among people.“I am absolutely sure that we benefitted a lot (due to Swachh Bharat Mission) in dealing with COVID-19,” he said.“We have always been slight ahead of the curve. When problem is coming, we were ready to deal with it. The country would have managed to deal with it (COVID-19) even without SBM, but the cost would have been much higher. I think SBM helped us considerably in that case,” he said.“The way forward is now that we will have to accelerate both Swachhta and other measures like ODF Plus because it was the greatest strength to fight the pandemic,” Puri said.The COVID-19 is also an urban problem by and large, he said, adding it is a different matter if some of “our brothers and sisters migrate back from urban areas to rural areas, they will be carrying the virus”.“But, it started here. I can argue that it is related from outside (the country)...We stopped flights…and screened 15 lakh passengers initially,” he said.

19-05-2020||New Delhi||Railways to run 200 non-AC passenger trains daily from June 1||Providing huge relief to people, especially in the country’s small towns and cities, the railways will run 200 special passenger trains from June 1, the national transporter said on Tuesday.These trains will have non-air conditioned second class coaches and will run daily.They will be plied in addition to the Shramik Special and the air-conditioned special trains which are currently being operated on the Rajdhani routes connecting 15 major cities to Delhi.All categories of passengers will be allowed to book tickets which will be available online.“Indian Railways will run 200 non-AC trains daily as per the time table from June 1, whose online booking will start soon,” tweeted Railway Minister Piyush Goyal.While the railways is yet to state which routes these trains will run on, officials said they could cater to the smaller towns and cities.Earlier, the railways had cancelled all its regular passenger services till June 30.Railways said the move to start these 200 trains would also be helpful for migrants who can avail these trains if they are unable to board the Shramik Special trains.“Efforts will be made such that they (migrants) will be able to board trains from   Railway Station Head on mainline which is close to their existing location,” the railways said.The railways also said it has asked the state governments to identify and locate the migrants who are walking on roads to go to their home states and transport them to the nearest main line railway station after registering them the nearest district headquarters. It has also asked the states to give a list of these travellers to the Railway Authorities so that arrangements can be made for their further travel through Shramik specials. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/railways-to-run-200-non-ac-passenger-trains-daily-from-june-1-87012
19-05-2020||New Delhi||Operated 1,595 Shramik Special trains, ferried over 21 lakh migrants: Railways||The Indian Railways has operated 1,595 Shramik Special trains since May 1 and ferried over 21 lakh migrants back home, the national transporter said on Tuesday.While Uttar Pradesh has allowed 837 trains, Bihar has permitted 428 and Madhya Pradesh more than 100, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said in a tweet.Among other originating states, more than 188 trains have started from Punjab, 89 from Karnataka, 61 from Tamil Nadu, 58 from Telangana, 54 from Rajasthan, 41 from Haryana and 38 from Uttar Pradesh.Out of the trains that have terminated so far, the maximum has been in Uttar Pradesh with more than 641, while 73 more are in transit, followed by Bihar with 310 and 53 more on the way.The operation of these trains has, however, led to political mudslinging, with the Opposition accusing the Centre of charging fares from migrants and then the Centre accusing some states having non-BJP governments of not providing permission for migrant trains to run.On Tuesday, the Railways also said it no longer needed the consent of the destination states to operate such trains after the Central Government issued a standard operating procedure (SOP), which said that for running Shramik Special trains, permission would be given by the Ministry of Railways in consultation with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).Railway spokesperson Rajesh Dutt Bajpai said: “Consent of terminating state not necessary to run Shramik Special trains. After the new SoP, the implication is that no consent of the receiving state is mandatory.”Over the last few weeks, the Centre has alleged that some states like West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, which have a significant migrant population in other states were not giving permission for migrant trains resulting in lakhs of them walking towards their homes hundreds of kilometres away.While the states have denied the allegations, data has shown otherwise.The new rule of bypassing the destination state will significantly ease the movement of migrants, officials said, with railways needing approval only from the originating states.The national transporter hopes to run up to 300 such trains and carry the remaining migrants home over the next week, the officials said.However, till Monday evening, some other migrant heavy states had agreed to receive very few trains — Chhattisgarh approved only 19 trains, Rajasthan only 33 trains and Jharkhand only 72 trains, according to official data.According to the officials, while the Railways has the capacity to run around 300 trains per day, it is operating half of that number because destination states are not sending an adequate number of approvals.A Shramik Special train carries around 1,700 passengers, instead of the earlier 1,200, to ferry as many workers home as possible.Initially, these trains had no scheduled stoppages during the journey, but the Railways now allows up to three stoppages in the destination states.While the transporter is yet to announce the cost incurred on these special services, the officials indicated that the national transporter is spending around Rs 80 lakh per service.

19-05-2020||New Delhi/Sonepat||They boarded bus to UP, were dropped at shelter home in Sonepat instead||After waiting for 14 hours, hundreds of migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh boarded buses from Sonepat but the promised ride home never did happen and they were dropped off at a shelter home in the Haryana town itself.Kuldeep Kumar was one of those who got on to a Haryana Roadways Transport Corporation bus from Kundli Industrial area on the Delhi-Haryana border at 7.30 pm.On Monday, happy the daylong wait had finally ended and he and his family would be home the next morning.Instead, much to their shock – and disappointment—the bus stopped at Sonepat’s Shambhu Dayal College, a makeshift shelter home, just a few kilometres away.  And that’s where the 22-year-old, his wife Aarti and his 10-month-old daughter Divyanshi were on Tuesday.“We have no idea what is happening.  I thought I will be home by now. Nobody is telling us how long we have to be here,” Kuldeep told PTI over the phone.There are almost 600 others with Kuldeep, locked within the confines of the temporary shelter home at the college and other ‘homes’ nearby.Officials handling the massive rush of migrants returning home on Monday said they were left with no option.“Some buses did leave for Uttar Pradesh. The Uttar Pradesh Government had permitted the entry of only a certain number of buses. But more people reached than what had been permitted, so people (migrant labourers) were kept in a shelter home,” explained Ashutosh Rajan, sub-divisional magistrate, Sonipat.    An increasingly frantic Kuldeep, who lost his job as a loader at the Kundli Industrial Estate, said he can’t go back to his rented accommodation in Sersa village nearby because his landlord had ordered him not to return, fearing he would bring with him the coronavirus infection.The village headman had announced that the government had made arrangements for migrant labourers to go back to their home state Uttar Pradesh. And Kuldeep took them at their word.So, on Sunday, he settled his dues with his landlord. And at the crack of dawn on Monday, around 5 am, left Sersa village for the Kundli Industrial Area a short distance away with his wife and baby.There were hundreds of others like him. It was a long wait in the scorching heat. When he finally boarded the bus at 7.30, they were assured they will be taken to Rae Bareli.His woes have only aggravated since then. He said his family have been allocated a room in the college along with another family. There are no facilities and no arrangements for infants and children, not even milk for his daughter.“The temperature is soaring and we have to open the windows. But that brings in hot air. A small fan for one room with two families does not serve the purpose and my daughter keeps crying,” he said.Several others in the home said they face the same predicament.His friend and colleague Ajay Kumar, also stranded in the shelter home, complained of bad quality food.“We are being served tasteless’ khichdi’. If we can’t eat it, how can the children have it,” said Ajay, who is with his wife Vimlesh and seven-month old son Sushil.Like Kuldeep, Ajay has also been jobless since the lockdown and is desperate to return to his village in Rae Bareli.Sandeep Kumar Mishra (39), one of the migrant workers at the shelter home, said they had no clue that they will be brought to the shelter home.Officials at the shelter home, too, don’t have any idea on when they will be allowed to go back, he said.“They have locked the shelter home. There is no way out and officials here do not have any answer,” he alleged.                           Sanjay G, the CEO of the Zilla Parishad, Sonepat, who is coordinating the operation to send migrant labourers back to their home states, said only 30 buses were to go to Uttar Pradesh and each bus was to carry only 30 people.He said only those migrant workers who had registered on the state portal were to be ferried.Accordingly, calls were made to them, but those who had not registered also turned up.“As per the plan, only 30 buses carrying 900 people were to go to Uttar Pradesh. I am not aware who gave the permission to send buses other than those decided upon. I have raised the issue with the Haryana Roadways State Transport,” Sanjay said.He added that nearly 600-700 migrant workers and their family members have been sent to different shelter homes.

In the spirit of cooperative federalism, the government of states, where these flights will take off and land should also be ready to allow civil aviation operations,” Puri tweeted.During the lockdown period, cargo flights, medical evacuation flights and special flights approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) have been allowed to operate.The first, second and third phase of the lockdown was between March 25 to April 14, April 15 to May 3 and May 4 to May 17, respectively. The fourth phase started from May 18 and would end on May 31.

19-05-2020||Vibha Sharma||Global warming making cyclones more powerful: Experts||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 19Experts are linking increased activity in the Indian Ocean and Amphan’s extreme intensity to global warming and abnormally warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs).“Global warming is making these cyclones more and more powerful by heating up ocean/sea surface waters and adding to their strength,” says environmentalist Soumya Dutta.“Unless we drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions right now, worlds' coastal and river bank populations will face even stronger cyclones/typhoons/hurricanes… with humongous losses to property and living assets,” says Dutta.Just like a rocket is powered by hydrogen and oxygen, cyclones/hurricanes are powered by water vapour. More global heating means more water vapours and more power to the cyclones.Already, global heating/climate change has caused over 250 per cent rise in such storms in the past 40 odd years, Dutta adds as he calls for an immediate and decisive action.Meanwhile, according to Simon Wang, Professor of Climate, at the Utah State University, abnormally warm sea surface temperatures were observed in the case of Amphan also.  “Last year set several new records for Indian Ocean cyclones. Was this an outlier year or a year that portends things to come? We can’t yet know. But we do know that the Indian Ocean is warming, and we know that warm ocean water is the first, and perhaps the key, ingredient for the formation of tropical cyclones, so the system is primed for more storms,” said Professor Wang.“In our paper on Fani (in 2019), which was a terribly destructive cyclone, we noted that warming temperatures in the air and ocean surface have significantly intensified cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. And what we’re seeing now is that abnormally warm sea surface temperatures were present in the case of Amphan, too,” Professor Wang added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/global-warming-making-cyclones-more-powerful-experts-86992
19-05-2020||Lucknow||Buses for migrant workers: Cong warns legal action against those defaming party||The Congress on Tuesday accused the Uttar Pradesh Government of indulging in “petty politics” over its offer to run buses for migrant workers and warned legal action against those defaming the party."Labourers and workers in lakhs are waiting at the borders of the state to come back for which the Congress had made arrangement of 1,000 buses. But the state government is not giving permission for the same by entangling the issue in technicalities," said senior Congress leader and former MP Pramod Tiwari."It has come to our notice that through social media and other means of communication, BJP members are alleging that registration numbers of buses provided by the party belong to two-wheelers... This is an attempt to defame the party," Tiwari added.The Congress would lodge a defamation case against those indulging in such things to malign the party's image, said Tiwari.According to Tiwari, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had sought permission from the Yogi Adityanath government to run the buses through a letter on May 16 and Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi had sought the details of the vehicles, its drivers and conductors which the party provided."It is most shameful that during this hour of crisis, a letter by the ACS is sent for handing over the buses to Lucknow administration by 10 in the morning and then it is told that they should be handed over to officials in Noida and Ghaziabad by 12 noon," Tiwari said.Now when the buses are reaching these places the local administration is saying that they do not have orders to allow them to enter the state, he added.“This is the height of autocracy. It is our demand that we should get a chance to serve the people by rising above political interests with a positive thinking," said Tiwari.There has been a back and forth exchange of communication over plying of the buses to ferry migrants home, after the Congress made available a list of buses, but the Uttar Pradesh Government sought their inspection in Lucknow and then at Gautam Budh Nagar.The Uttar Pradesh Government has also alleged that some of the bus numbers given by the Congress were of two-wheelers and three-wheelers.

19-05-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Health Ministry issues guidelines for dental clinics||Dental clinics in the COVID-19 containment zones will remain closed, however, they can continue to provide teleconsultation to patients, according to the guidelines issued by the Union Health Ministry for dental professionals in view of the ongoing pandemic.Stating that dentists, auxiliaries as well as the patients undergoing dental procedures are at high risk of cross-infection as most dental procedures require close contact with the patients’ oral cavity, saliva, blood and respiratory tract secretions, the Ministry has advised that all patients must be treated with due precautions.“Saliva is rich in COVID-19 viral load. Many patients who are asymptomatic may be carriers. For this reason, it is suggested that all patients visiting a dental office must be treated with due precautions,” it underlined.According to the advisory, dental clinics will remain closed in the containment zones. However, they can continue to provide teleconsultation and the patients in these zones can seek ambulance services to travel to the nearby COVID dental facility.Emergency dental procedures can be performed in the dental facilities falling under the red zones.The dental clinics in the orange and green zones can provide consultancy, but such operations should be restricted to emergency and urgent treatment procedures only, the guidelines stated.All routine and elective dental procedures should be deferred for a later review until new policy/guidelines are issued.“Due to the high risk associated with the examination of the oral cavity, oral cancer screening under the National Cancer Screening programme should be deferred until new policy or guidelines are issued,” the Ministry said.The clinical conditions of dental origin, which require priority care but do not increase the patient’s death risk, are categorised as “urgent” and those increasing the patient’s death risk are categorised as “emergency”, it said.The guidelines were issued as the death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 3,163 and the number of cases crossed the one lakh-mark in the country on Tuesday.Healthcare workers who are asymptomatic and do not fall under the category of being exposed to COVID-19 are not required to undergo a test before resuming to work in the clinics.According to the advisory issued by the Ministry, all asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are advised to take HCQ prophylaxis after medical consultation.The Ministry also outlined the guidelines for maintaining ventilation and air quality management in stand-alone dental clinics.It suggested maintaining air circulation with natural air through a frequent opening of windows and using an independent exhaust blower to extract the room air into the atmosphere.According to the guidelines, the use of a ceiling fan while performing a procedure should be avoided, a table fan should be placed behind the operator to let the airflow towards the patient. A strong exhaust fan should be so located to create a unidirectional flow of air away from the patient. The air-conditioners should be frequently serviced and the filters cleaned.In centrally air-conditioned buildings, blocking off the return air vents in the patient area will temporarily stop air circulation, provided the AHU has a provision to receive adequate outdoor air supply.“Allow fresh air into rooms by the opening of windows or doors slightly,” the guidelines stated.Visual alerts should be displayed at the entrance of the facility and in strategic areas (waiting areas, elevators) about respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette, social distancing and disposal of contaminated items in trash cans.“Ensure availability of sufficient three-layer masks and sanitisers and paper tissue at the registration desk, as well as nearby hand hygiene stations. Distant waiting chairs, preferably a metre apart,” the guidelines said.The guidelines suggested that the patients should not wear a wristwatch, hand and body jewellery and carry additional accessories and bags, and use their own washrooms at home to avoid the need of using toilets at the dental facility. They should also wear a mask.As far as the protocols of patient handling in the clinic area are concerned, for appointments that do not result in aerosols and need examination, doctors can only wear a triple-layer surgical mask and protective eyewear/face shield along with gloves.“Wear N95 face masks, protective eyewear/face shields and gloves along with coverall for high-risk and very-high-risk procedures. To increase the shelf life of N95 masks, you may cover them with a surgical mask and discard only the surgical mask after use,” the guidelines stated.When examining patients with moderate risks, the doctor would require all PPE except that the coveralls can be substituted with surgical gowns, it said.

Such groups are criminal in nature and do not deserve any protection of free or creative speech,” advocate Virag Gupta, appearing for Govindacharya, argued before the Bench.The petition, filed through advocate Gaurav Pathak, further contended that “the incident of ‘bois locker room’ on Instagram shows one of the vilest forms of social media”.Central government standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia accepted notice on behalf of the ministries.Govindacharya, in his plea, has further claimed that most of such groups are focused on pornography, nudity, graphic violent content, rave parties and other topics which are illegal and against community standards.The application has also contended that most of the content on such groups are also in violation of terms of agreements of social media companies like Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and TikTok. However, they take no steps to remove such groups, it further claimed.It further argued that during the COVID-19 related lockdown, the world moved online and invariably, with increased access to internet, more and more minors have joined social media, and this includes children who are less than 13 years of age.“It is most humbly submitted that it is our collective responsibility to ensure a safe cyberspace for our children,” the application has said.The application was filed in Govindacharya’s main petition seeking removal of fake news and hate speech being circulated on social media and online platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google.The main petition, which has also sought details about the designated officers of these platforms, is listed for hearing on July 14.The petition has alleged that social media platforms “have become a haven for hate speech” and in the absence of details of designated officers, there is “no clear mechanism to enforce justice” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-to-remove-groups-like-bois-locker-room-from-social-media-hc-seeks-centre-platforms-reply-86984
19-05-2020||Naveen S Garewal||Union Minister, Telangana CM spat over COVID-19 package||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, May 19Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) have entered into a verbal dual over the “Rs 20 lakh relief package” announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.After KCR accused the Centre of treating states like “beggars” and termed the relief package a “joke”, Reddy on Tuesday reacted, saying that the Chief Minister’s language was “objectionable” and will not be tolerated.Mounting a sharp attack on the Centre, KCR alleged that the Centre was treating states like "beggars" and imposing "laughable" conditions for increasing borrowing limits under the FRBM Act. "This is pure cheating and amounts to betrayal, jugglery of numbers and is nothing but gas," KCR had said during a press briefing on Monday."This is a very cruel package. It is fully in a feudal policy and dictatorial attitude. We fully condemn this. This is not what we asked for and at a time when the finances of states were paralysed due to COVID-19 global pandemic, the state governments wanted funds to reach them so that they can help people in different forms,” said the CM.Addressing media through video-conference, Kishan Reddy, said the Prime Minister had brought the best practices in the world to tackle the COVID-19 after holding discussions with a cross section of people, and asked KCR, “Is it not true that Telangana would benefit from this Rs 20 lakh crore package?” “The FRBM limit has been increased with an intention to see the states also grow. Devolution of funds was also increased (during NDA regime) by nine per cent,” said Reddy.He asked the Telangana Chief Minister to restrain from “misleading the people of the state and appreciate the efforts of the Centre”.Teachers facing tough timeMeanwhile, the financial situation of people is going from bad to worse and some teachers are being forced to work in agriculture fields. This was alleged by the Telangana Private Teachers Forum president Sheik Shabbir Ali who said around 11,700 government-recognised private schools in the state had not paid their 1.50 lakh teachers since March 15, forcing them to take up odd jobs.Ali claimed that in one instance, a teacher in Yadadri-Bhongir district had taken up drought-related works of removing unwanted plants in a village.The association has sent a representation to Chief Minister requesting steps for payment of salaries.With the opening up of the lockdown across the state, barring in and around Hyderabad, buses returned to roads after two months.The State-owned Telangana State Road Transport Corporation resumed bus services from 6 am in all 32 districts.With the greater Hyderabad area being the worst affected, the government has decided not to resume bus service in the city.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-minister-telangana-cm-spat-over-covid-19-package-86983

It granted him protection from coercive actions for further three weeks from today, but declined his plea that probe be transferred to CBI.Holding that a journalist cannot be subjected to several criminal cases for one incident, a bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah dealt with the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression of media under the Constitution with that of other citizens' and the CrPC provisions on criminal probe.“The exercise of journalistic freedom lies at the core of speech and expression protected by Article 19(1)(a) (freedom of speech and expression). The petitioner is a media journalist. The airing of views on television shows which he hosts is in the exercise of his fundamental right to speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a). India's freedoms will rest safely as long as journalists can speak to power without being chilled by a threat of reprisal,” the bench said.The court said however that the exercise of the fundamental right of speech and expression is not absolute and the media is answerable to the legal regime enacted with reference to the provisions of reasonable restrictions.“But to allow a journalist to be subjected to multiple complaints and to the pursuit of remedies traversing multiple states and jurisdictions when faced with successive FIRs and complaints bearing the same foundation has a stifling effect on the exercise of that freedom. This will effectively destroy the freedom of the citizen to know of the affairs of governance in the nation and the right of the journalist to ensure an informed society,” Justice Chandrachud said in the 56-page judgement.It said though the freedom of speech and expression of a journalist was “not higher” than the right of a but “we must as a society never forget that one cannot exist without the other. Free citizens cannot exist when the news media is chained to adhere to one position”.Quoting from a recent book of Yuval Noah Harari, Justice Chandrachud said: “Questions you cannot answer are usually far better for you than answers you cannot question.”Quashing several FIRs and complaints except the initial one, the judgement said the manner in which Goswami has been subjected to numerous FIRs in several states on the basis of identical allegations would leave no manner of doubt that the intervention of this court was necessary to protect his rights as a citizen and as a journalist to fair treatment guaranteed under Article 14 (right to equality) and the liberty to conduct an independent portrayal of views.“In such a situation to require the petitioner to approach the respective High Courts having jurisdiction for quashing would result into a multiplicity of proceedings and unnecessary harassment to the petitioner, who is a journalist,” it said.

They are not wearing face masks.The home guard gestures at them with his baton to continue rolling from one side to the other and goes on to hit one of them in the back for stopping. The policeman stands at some distance watching.A train passes by while all this is happening.“The policeman concerned has been found guilty and suspended with immediate effect by the Superintendent of Police, Hapur. A report has been presented to the District Commandant, Homeguard, recommending necessary action against the guilty homeguard,” the Hapur police tweeted.In view of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Uttar Pradesh government has invoked the Epidemic Act, 1897, and the Uttar Pradesh Epidemic Disease (COVID-19) Rules, 2020.These laws make covering the face in public places compulsory either using masks or handkerchief or ‘gamchha’, and violation of the order can invite legal action.

No untoward incident was reported and the people dispersed peacefully, the police added.The scene at Bandra station was chaotic as the most migrants were not wearing masks, disregarded social-distancing norms and jostled to enter the station premises.Police officials from Bandra police station said the crowds gathered after rumours were spread on social media that trains were leaving for Bihar.“We are trying to figure out the sources of the rumours. Travel without reservation is not allowed and anyone spreading rumours will be punished,” the duty officer at Bandra police station said.Last month, huge crowds gathered at Bandra railway station after rumours of a special train to North India was spread on social media.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-3-000-migrants-throng-mumbais-bandra-for-shramik-special-86968
19-05-2020||New Delhi||WHO unanimously passes resolution on COVID-19 probe||China joined a resolution seeking to identify the zoonotic source of the COVID-19 virus at the General Assembly of the World Health Assembly (WHA) which was passed unanimously.India was among the countries that had joined the resolution before the start of the Assembly on Monday at a time when it was being interpreted as seeking to corner China.The US agenda of seeking Taiwan’s inclusion at the Assembly, targeting the WHO Director and pinning down China did not go as planned after most countries supported tackling of non-Covid issues after the pandemic was over.On the other hand, the resolution called for a non-profit seeking approach by voluntary pooling and licensing of patents to ensure affordable diagnostics, medicines and vaccines.While US President Donald Trump has frozen funding to WHO, the resolution sought sustainable funding to ensure it can fully respond to public health needs. It also asked the WHO to demonstrate leadership on health in the UN system, and “continue to act as the health cluster lead’’ in the UN humanitarian response”.On the US demand to evaluate WHO’s response to COVID, most countries demonstrated a desire to wait till the crises is over and then ask the DG for an impartial and independent evaluation of the lessons learnt from WHO’s response to the pandemic.China interpreted the adoption of the resolution as seeking to support WHO in playing a leading role. All these [clauses] are in line with China’s position. The adoption of any resolution is the result of the joint efforts of member states and the text should not be interpreted in an out-of-context and one-sided way,” said the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-unanimously-passes-resolution-on-covid-19-probe-86965

19-05-2020||New Delhi||India records 0.2 COVID-19 deaths per lakh population as against global figure of 4.1: Health ministry||India has so far about 0.2 COVID-19 deaths per lakh population as against the global figure of 4.1, the Union health ministry said as the number of fatalities due to coronavirus infection in the country rose to 3,163 on Tuesday and the total cases reached 1,01,139.Also, a record number of 1,08,233 samples were tested for COVID-19 on Monday in the country. So far a total of 24,25,742 samples have been tested, the ministry said.Referring to data from WHO situation report-119, the ministry said 3,11,847 COVID-19 mortalities have been reported till Tuesday worldwide which is about 4.1 deaths per lakh population.Among the countries with high COVID-19 casualties, the US with 87,180 fatalities has 26.6 deaths per lakh population. The UK has reported 34,636 deaths and has approximately 52.1 deaths per lakh population, it said.Italy with 31,908 instances of coronavirus fatalities so far has around 52.8 deaths per lakh population. France has so far reported 28,059 casualties which is about 41.9 deaths per lakh population while Spain with 27, 650 fatalities has about 59.2 deaths per lakh.Germany, Iran, Canada, Netherlands and Mexico with 7,935 deaths, 6,988 deaths, 5,702 deaths, 5,680 deaths and 5,045 fatalities have a mortality of around 9.6, 8.5, 15.4, 33.0 and 4.0 per lakh population respectively.China, which so far has recorded 4,645 casualties due to COVID-19 so far has approximately 0.3 deaths per lakh population."The relatively low death figures represent timely case identification and clinical management of the cases," the ministry said.On testing, it said from one laboratory conducting COVID-19 test in January, India has very rapidly increased its capacity by adding over 385 government laboratories and 158 private laboratories."Duly forging partnerships with all central government labs, state medical colleges, private medical colleges and private sector, the testing capacity in the country has been expanded," the ministry said.Other testing machines like TrueNAT and CBNAAT have also been mobilised to ramp up testing.Through 14 AIIMS-like mentor institutions, handholding of labs across the country is undertaken to ensure adequate bio-safety standards and accreditation of the laboratories, the ministry said.To maintain a steady supply of testing material to the labs, 15 depots have been created by roping in India Post and private agencies for distribution.Many Indian companies have been supported to undertake the production of testing material which was earlier primarily sourced from abroad."This has helped in maintaining steady supplies across the country," the ministry said.

19-05-2020||New York||Humid climates, summer weather may not limit pandemic growth: Study||Since the COVID-19 pandemic can easily spread among a vast pool of highly susceptible people, without control measures, seasonal and geographic climate variations alone may not slow down the pandemic, a new study says.The findings of the research, published in the journal ‘Science’, noted that strong outbreaks were likely in more humid climates, and summer weather would not substantially limit the growth of the pandemic.According to the researchers, including those from Princeton University in the US, a large number of people are still vulnerable to the novel coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic.Based on the speed at which the pathogen spreads, they said climate conditions were only likely to “make a dent” in the current rate of infection.“We project that warmer or more humid climates will not slow the virus at the early stage of the pandemic,” said study first author Rachel Baker from Princeton University.While climate has some influence on the size and the timing of the pandemic in general, Baker said, there was enough number of susceptible people in the population for the virus to spread quickly, no matter the atmospheric conditions.She said the rapid spread of the virus in Brazil, Australia, and other nations in the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere — where the virus began during the summer season — provides indication that warmer conditions might not halt the pandemic.“It doesn’t seem that climate is regulating spread right now,” Baker said.Scientists, however, were unsure how temperature and humidity influenced the virus’ transmission, she said.Based on studies of other similar viruses, the researchers said, COVID-19 might become responsive to seasonal changes only after the supply of unexposed hosts was reduced if vaccines or other control measures were not present.“Previously circulating human coronaviruses, such as the common cold, depend strongly on seasonal factors, peaking in the winter outside of the tropics,” said Bryan Grenfell, another co-author of the study from Princeton University.If the novel coronavirus could be similarly seasonal, Grenfell said, it might settle down to become a winter virus as it becomes endemic in the population.Exactly how this might happen, depends on a lot of complex factors for a given location, he added.Grenfell explained that the pandemic’s trajectory over the next several months would be influenced by “both human-induced factors such as non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce contact, and fundamental biological uncertainties.These, he said, included factors such as the strength and duration of immunity following infection.“As knowledge of the immune response develops, we hope to be able to project its interaction with seasonality more accurately,” Grenfell added.In the study, the researchers ran simulations on how the pandemic would respond to various climates across the globe.Since COVID-19’s response to warmer weather is not well known, the researchers ran three scenarios based on the behaviour of similar viruses under varying seasons.In the first scenario, they assumed that the novel coronavirus had the same climate sensitivity as influenza, based on earlier models from laboratory studies that highlighted the importance of low humidity to promote spread.In the second and third cases, they gave the virus in the model the same climate dependence and length of immunity as human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1, which are two causes of the common cold.According to their analysis, climate only became a mitigating factor when large portions of the human population were immune or resistant to the virus.“The more that immunity builds up in the population, the more we expect the sensitivity to climate to increase,” Baker said.If the model was run long enough, they said the big pandemic settled into a seasonal infection.“We’re assuming that if the same climate drivers apply to COVID-19, this would be the outcome,” Baker added.When the scientists ran a simulation accounting for the impact of control measures like physical distancing, the results suggested that the longer these measures are in place, and slow the transmission of COVID-19, the more sensitive the virus becomes to warmer weather.“The next step is to test our model by comparing future changes in the pandemic curve with detailed measurements of local climate, control measures, and other local variables in different climatic regions,” said study co-author Jessica Metcalf from Princeton University.According to the scientists, the study has broader implications for refining the integration of weather information with disease outbreaks models.They said a deeper, interdisciplinary understanding of the interplay of multiple factors that impact disease evolution, such as disease dynamics, weather, and mitigation measures undertaken by society, is needed.

A reward of Rs 21,000 will be given to the person who bring them here,” the posters, put up in several places here with the images of the two, read.A line from a Hindi film song that goes ‘Chitthi na koi Sandesh’ was also written on the posters to drive home the point of the Nath duo being “incommunicado”.Local Congress leaders submitted a memorandum to the police about the posters, with Chhindwara Kotwali police station in charge Vinod Kushwaha stating that action will be taken after a probe.Meanwhile, BJP leader Pankaj Chaturvedi, a close aide of former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, told PTI Kamal Nath and Nakul Nath were offering a lot of knowledge about coronavirus threat to the people these days.“But how much work are they doing at the ground level? The problem is that Kamal Nath is busy fighting an internal battle in the Congress. So he has no time for Chhindwara. They will reach their constituencies only when polls are around,” he said.Hitting back, MP Congress media coordinator Narendra Saluja told PTI the BJP should state how many times Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan visited his Assembly seat Budhni during the outbreak, adding that the latter had not stepped out of capital Bhopal even once.“Both Kamal Nath and Nakul Nath are in touch with the people in Chhindwara. Both are in a red zone at present and can’t move out from there. This is BJP’s misinformation campaign,” he said.Last week, similar ‘missing in action’ posters had come up in Bhopal targeting its BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur.

The TMC hogged the lime-light with more number of MPs, who had been vocal against the Narendra Modi government.The Left have found their aggression since announcement of the lockdown, and exodus of labourers to their home states following loss of jobs.The Left and their frontal organisations have stepped up to the plate accusing the Union Government of apathy and mishandling of the labour issue.To drive home the point they hold up the measures of the government of Left-ruled state of Kerala to contain the Covid-19 pandemic as a successful model."The Left parties have raised the welfare of labourers with all seriousness and would not let the issue fade," said a senior CPI(M) leader.Another leader singled out the "truancy" of the TMC government in West Bengal in providing help to migrant labourers hailing from the state, but stranded outside.He said Mamata Banerjee government’s attitude in not allowing trains to bring in the stranded labourers would be a heavy price the TMC will have to pay."The labour and mishandling of coronavirus by the TMC government and the Union Government will be a major election plank of Left parties," said the leader.The Left-leaning central trade unions along with others have given a call to observe May 22 as national protest day against the Union Government’s dealing of labour and other issues.The organisations related to peasants and affiliated to Left have also given a call for nationwide agitation on May 27.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/left-parties-striving-to-reclaim-their-base-stature-86952

19-05-2020||New Delhi||US govt set to donate 200 ventilators to India, first tranche of 50 to arrive soon||The US government is planning to "donate" 200 ventilators to India with the first tranche of 50 expected to arrive soon as part of efforts to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, an American official said on Tuesday.President Donald Trump had announced last week that the US will donate ventilators to India to treat the COVID-19 patients and help it fight the "invisible enemy".Asked about reports that the ventilators may come at a cost for India, USAID Acting Director Ramona El Hamzaoui, during a telebriefing with the media, asserted that it was a "donation"."The US government is planning to donate 200 ventilators to India. We expect the first tranche of 50 to arrive soon," she said.The USAID on behalf of the US and through the generosity of the American people and the innovation of the American private industry is providing access to medical supplies and ventilators to India and other countries, Hamzaoui said."We are working closely with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the Indian Red Cross Society and other relevant stakeholders in India and the US to assist in the delivery, transportation and placement of these donated ventilators," she said.These ventilators will complement India's ongoing efforts to make the best of care immediately available to those most in need, she added.Asked if the ventilators were being provided as part of some sort of a deal after India supplied hydroxychloroquine to the US, Hamzaoui, "I do not think it is a quid pro quo. It is a partnership."The US is providing ventilators to countries based on what is available and supporting partner countries.Asked about American financial aid to countries in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, Hamzaoui said the USAID and the US Department of State has made available USD 900 million to combat the deadly virus globally.With regard to India specifically, the USAID has announced USD 5.9 million in funding to combat COVID-19, including USD 2.9 million to help India provide care for the affected, disseminate essential public health messages to communities, strengthen case finding, contact tracing and surveillance, she said at the briefing organised by the US Embassy here."We have also developed COVID-19 print and social media communication material, and we are training community health officers working in over 30,000 health and wellness centres in 14 states on COVID-19 readiness and response," Hamzaoui said."Today the USAID has been able to train in partnership with the government of India more than 20,000 healthcare workers who cover more than 100 million people," she said.The rest of the USD 3 million aid is to support the national health authority to establish a financing facility that can mobilise resources from the private sector, the USAID official said.To a question on President Donald Trump's letter to the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) threatening to pull US funding permanently over COVID-19, US' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Mission Director Meghna Desai said during the briefing that "we are working to ascertain the implications to ensure that we have limited impact to our activities particularly global emergency response activities".The pandemic has made it clear that the world has more in common and COVID-19 has to be fought unitedly, Desai said.On US' COVID-19 vaccine development efforts, US Health Attache Preetha Rajaraman the search for a vaccine remains one of US' highest priorities.The US National Institutes of Health has allocated USD 350 million towards this effort, while an additional allocation of USD 2.6 billion for the development and bringing to market has also been pledged, she said.She added that the issue if access was an important one and was being given consideration.Responding to a question about CDC aid to India, Desai said it has pledged USD 3.6 million to assist the government of India in response to COVID-19 and the selection of partners for the aid was based on the scope of work and in concurrence with the ministries of the Indian government.

Vande Bharat Mission continues to get Indians home,” said the Indian High Commission in London.The Vande Bharat Mission is India’s biggest ever repatriation exercise to bring back Indians from abroad who are unable to travel home due to COVID-19 related international travel restrictions.As the second phase of the repatriation process gets underway, retired Indian High Commissioner to the UK Ruchi Ghanashyam will be among the Indians flying back to New Delhi on Thursday.“It has been such a hectic period, but I hope to return to the UK to say goodbyes in person sometime in the future,” Ghanashyam said during a virtual farewell organised by the Indian Journalists’ Association (IJA UK) on Monday.As the packed flights take off daily, there are some still desperately waiting their turn, including those wanting to fly to some cities that are yet to be scheduled, including Kolkata.“I have two young daughters, elderly parents, and a wife back at home. There is no way to return to Kolkata. I am worried for my parents,” says Suvendu, who came to the UK for work but recently lost his job.“I am really surprised there are no Kolkata flights yet, but I am hoping they will be announced in the future,” adds Dr Arpita Ray, whose father needs to fly back home.Another group waiting their turn to return home to their families in India includes students in the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) category, which remains suspended in India’s extended COVID-19 lockdown.According to the regulations issued by the Indian government last month and updated last week, visas of foreign nationals and OCI cards, that provide visa-free travel privileges to the people of Indian-origin, have been suspended as part of the new international travel restrictions following the COVID-19 pandemic.“Our plight is no different from the struggles being faced by Indian students who hold Indian passports---India is home for all us,” says Tridip, an undergraduate at SOAS University of London.“Yes, air travel at this point of time may be a risk but we are of course ready to take all precautionary measures and undergo the mandatory quarantine period upon arrival in India,” adds the 18-year-old.“Having lived in India for the greater part of my life, India is home to me as much as it is to an Indian citizen, and just as any Indian citizen wishes for the comfort of home and family, so do I. I can only hope that the government reviews its policy on OCI holders and appeal to them to include us in their repatriation plans,” says Atulit, an under-graduate student at Imperial College London.Bianta, a student at Bangor University in Wales, adds: “Along with all of the mental stress, financially the UK is too expensive. In the coming weeks my rental agreement will expire, after which I will have nowhere to go.“I cannot continue funding myself here in the UK as I only planned to be here till May marking the end of my course. Please help us get home. The colour of my passport does not define where my home is.”     As all commercial international flights continue to be grounded, the second phase of the Vande Bharat Mission with a total of 149 flights is aimed at bringing back Indians from 40 countries. On landing in India, these travellers have a 14-day quarantine requirement at venues organised by the respective state governments.

The first positive case was reported after an inmate had undergone a surgery in DDU Hospital on May 11. After being found positive, he was shifted to LNJP Hospital, dedicated for COVID-19 treatment, where he is recuperating. The committee, set up on Supreme Court’s order to look into decongesting prisons and prevent spread of COVID-19 there, decided that new entrants in jail should be kept in isolation wards to prevent their intermingling with other inmates.It said precautions be taken by jail staff, medical staff, maintenance staff and others entering the premises for delivery of essentials so that they do not come in direct contact with the prisoners.“Feeling concerned” about the issue, the committee chairperson asked the DG (Prisons) regarding availability of individual cells in any prison which can be converted into isolation cells for keeping the new entrants at least for an initial period of 14 days to prevent them from coming in contact with other inmates.Minutes of the meeting recorded that the DG (Prisons) informed that jail no.15 of Mandoli prison has an overall capacity of 280 prisoners and it has 248 individual cells with attached toilets and currently it houses 178 inmates, who are ‘high risk prisoners’.It has been decided by the committee to shift the 160 of these 178 high risk prisoners to different jails in Tihar which also has high risk wards to accommodate them. The other 18 who are working as ‘sahayak’ will remain in Mandoli jail.The committee was satisfied with the steps being taken by jail authorities to prevent the spread of coronavirus in prison premises.It was informed that till Monday, a total of 3,678 prisoners, including undertrials and convicts, have been released on interim bail, parole or remission of sentence as part of the programme to de-congest jails here to contain the spread of COVID-19.    The committee also made it clear that no prisoner in whatsoever category/ class he falls and whatever nature of offence he is facing trial, can seek or claim to be released from prison as a matter of right.It said the Supreme Court has clarified on April 13 that it has not directed the states or Union Territories to compulsorily release the prisoners from their respective prisons. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-inmates-staff-in-rohini-jail-quarantined-contact-tracing-on-hc-judge-headed-panel-told-86942

Social distancing would be observed by all passengers during boarding and travel and on arrival at their destination will have to adhere to health protocols prescribed by the destination state/UT, an official communication by Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/home-ministry-does-away-with-permission-from-states-to-run-shramik-special-trains-86929

We also call on all the G20 leaders to honour existing global health commitments,” the statement added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/satyarthi-among-88-noble-laureates-leaders-call-for-usd-1-trillion-to-protect-children-amid-covid-19-86928
19-05-2020||New Delhi||Woman IPS officer puts duty before self, ensures high morale of force||Delhi's Joint Commissioner of Police Shalini Singh says that maintaining law and order during the lockdown is not a problem, per se. However, she said, she wanted to ensure that no one remaining indoors in areas under her jurisdiction remained without essential items.She is leading the police force from the front, putting in, on an average, 16 to 18 hours of duty every day.Shalini Singh is the first woman officer to head a Delhi Police range in the past over four decades, ever since the national capital adopted the commissionerate system on July 1, 1978.In an interview to IANS, she talked about her daily routine. The IPS officer of AGMUT cadre (1996-batch) said that she ensured that she was through her daily diary reports between six and nine a.m. in the morning."I try to ensure that by 10.30 a.m. I am among my staff and the public so that no one feels left out in this crisis. Being the Joint CP of three police districts, I am responsible for the working of officials ranging from DCPs to constables and then taking care of problems faced by the public. I perform duty for 16-18 hours daily before I return home late in the night." Asked if she could take care of her family after all the rigours of duty, Shalini Singh said that her family was very supportive. While her two daughters could now take care of themselves, her husband, who too is an IPS officer, was very supportive."I have only to be careful with my 85-year-old mother-in-law. But since I am on duty, my husband and daughters take good care of her. I take all precautions when I return from duty, so as to save my family from coronavirus."The IPS officer said that she alerts her family before she returns from the office every night. So, as she arrives at her home, the doors are already opened for her so that she does not have to touch anything in the house. She straightaway heads for the bathroom to take a bath and wash her own uniform. After partaking of food placed in her room, she isolates herself and goes to sleep.Shalini Singh said that though she may not be doing any vigorous work during her duty hours, but her mere presence on the field must be a morale-booster for the constabulary during these difficult times.Asked what all changes the coronavirus scare had brought about in her life as an IPS officer, she said that she had visited all police stations, police posts and different areas under her jurisdiction to supervise various works. In Najafgarh, an area known for criminal activities, the biggest community kitchen in the three police districts had been set up by both men and women police personnel to ensure fresh food to the poor and needy amid the lockdown."Had this coronavirus crisis not come, I would never have been able to learn so much in my career, not even afterwards," the IPS officer remarked.She said that the crisis had changed her philosophy of life. "Coronavirus has bridged the gap between the rich and the poor. It has changed our outlook. What I could not learn in the last 24 years of police service, I have learnt in the last 50 days or so."She pointed out that tackling the liquor mafia in Outer, Western and Dwarka police districts during the nationwide lockdown was a big challenge and Delhi Police had been able to control it."The liquor mafia had been coming up with novel ways to smuggle liquor. We seized an ambulance in which the mafia was smuggling liquor hidden in a freezer meant to preserve dead bodies."Mentioning the names of Dwarka DCP Anto Alphonso, DCP Deepak Purohit of West Delhi, DCP Dr A. Kon of Outer Delhi, and Additional DCPs Subodh and Samir Sharma, the Joint Commissioner of Police said these officers were out in the field performing their duties with dedication.

For hours, 500 buses have been held up at Uncha Nagla border. On the Delhi border another 300 buses have reached. Please let these 879 buses proceed.”“Tomorrow we will provide you a fresh list of 200 buses. Do verify that list as well. People are in pain and sad. We cannot delay any further,” said Priyanka tweeted.If you wish, you can run these buses under the BJP banner and may even paste your posters, but don’t refuse our right to serve.Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Congress leaderThe 1,000 buses being provided by Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for the return of UP workers clearly appears to have become a victim of a bitter political tug-of-war between the Congress and Yogi-led BJP government in Lucknow.In a day of swift developments, the state government launched a frontal attack on Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Sonia Gandhi charging them with playing politics by passing on registration numbers of private cars, two- and three-wheelers and good carriers as that of buses.In a concerted exercise, Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma, rural development minister Mahendra Singh and MSME minister and government spokesperson Siddharth Nath Singh held impromptu press conferences to attack Priyanka Gandhi and the Congress.The first press conference on Tuesday was of cabinet minister and government spokesperson. Singh charged the Congress party with a ‘farziwada’ (scam) as the list of buses provided by them included registration numbers of two- and three-wheelers, private vehicles as well as goods carrier.Singh alleged that the offer of 1,000 buses was a “political stunt” and demanded an explanation from Congress president Sonia Gandhi.According to him, a preliminary scrutiny of the list of registration numbers of buses provided by the Congress yesterday has revealed a “scam” as it includes the registration number of goods carriers, private vehicles, two-wheelers and three-wheelers.The minister said that the registration numbers were being verified from the government of India portal.Refusing to answer a question about how many of the 1000 registration numbers were of other vehicles, he said that the exercise to verify them was still going.Hitting out at the Congress party, he alleged that the party was not concerned about the poor but only wanted to draw political mileage out of the whole issue.To a question if the UP government would accept the offer of 1,000 buses of the AICC, he said as a responsible government it was “our duty to first verify all documents, licences, fitness certificates before taking a final decision”.Deputy CM Sharma also demanded an apology from Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for playing a cruel joke with the migrant workers. Earlier in the day, additional chief secretary Avanish Awasthi had asked Priyanka’s private secretary to place 500 buses with the Ghaziabad district magistrate by 12 noon and another 500 buses with the Noida district magistrate.In his third letter addressed to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s private secretary, he had asked for the Ghaziabad buses to be parked at Kaushambi and Sahibabad bus stations and the 500 Noida buses at a ground near the Expo Mart.The letter had pointed out that the district magistrates concerned would use the buses only after verifying the permits, fitness, insurance certificates, etc., and drivers’ licence and conductors’ papers.This missive was part of the nightlong ping-pong match of letters between the ACS Awasthi and Gandhi Vadra’s private secretary Sachin Singh.After dilly-dallying for two days on Monday evening ACS Awasthi had responded to Priyanka’s letter of May 16 in which she had made the offer.In his reply addressed to her private secretary Sandeep Singh, Awasthi referred to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s May 16 letter and accepted the offer requesting a list of the names and contact details of the drivers and conductors of the buses.Within hours, Sandeep Singh responded to the letter by email in which he had attached the list of drivers and conductors as well as the registration number of the vehicles and had sought time to provide some additional details after re-verification.The UP government is now claiming that many of these vehicles are in fact, registered as private vehicles, good carriers, two- and three-wheelers.Singh had mentioned in his letter that he expected the UP government to put the buses in service by May 19 and make available the route of the buses and the timetable to the common people.However, ACS Awasthi wrote another letter to Singh referring to Singh’s earlier email. This according to Singh was mailed to him at 11.40 pm on May 18.In this second missive, Awasthi had also sought the fitness certificates of the buses, drivers’ licence, as well as full details of the conductors by 10 am along with the buses which were to reach Lucknow by 10 am.By 10 am on May 19, Awasthi had wanted all the buses at Vrindavan Yojana Sector 15-16 in Lucknow handed over to the District Magistrate of Lucknow.Responding to Awasthi’s second letter Singh in a letter written at 2.10 am on May 19 in which with due apologies Singh charged the move of being inspired by politics.“Aisa lagta nahi hai keh aapki sarkar vipda ke marey hamarey UP ke shramik bhai-behnon ki madad karna chahti hai.  (It does not appear that your government wants to help our pandemic-hit worker brothers and sisters of UP).”In his letter Singh points out that the media is continuously showing that lakhs of workers are stranded at various borders of UP especially in Delhi-UP’s border areas like Ghaziabad and Noida.“In a situation when thousands walked down to the UP border to get themselves registered at the centres, taking 1,000 empty buses to Lucknow is not just a waste of time and resources but the result of extreme inhumanness and the result of anti-poor mindset,” he said in the letter.Refusing to budge from the earlier stand of helping stranded workers reach their homes Singh once again requested for route map and timetable to run the buses from the Ghazipur border in Ghaziabad and Noida border.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yogi-govt-calls-priyankas-offer-of-1-000-buses-to-ferry-migrants-a-scam-up-cong-chief-held-86925

19-05-2020||Satya Prakash||SC refuses to transfer cases to CBI, grants protection to Arnab Goswami for 3 weeks||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 19The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami's petitions seeking quashing of two FIRs against him for allegedly communalising lynching of two Hindu sadhus at Palghar and an incident of migrant workers gathering at Bandra railway station in Mumbai during COVID19 lockdown.Maintaining that quashing of FIRs couldn’t be done on a petition filed under Article 32 of the Constitution, a Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud said he could pursue appropriate remedy before a competent court.The Bench -- which also included Justice MR Shah -- turned down his plea for transfer of cases being probed by police in Maharashtra to the CBI.However, it extended the protection from coercive action given to him for further three weeks.The top court ordered the Mumbai Police Commissioner to ensure protection of Goswami who was once attacked while heading home from work last month.No other FIR or complaint shall be entertained or pursued on the basis of broadcast made by Goswami on April 21 on lynching of Hindu saints at Palghar, the top court said while ordering consolidation of FIRs.Maintaining that journalists enjoyed fundamental right to free speech, the Bench said it was not an absolute right.Goswami had on May 5 moved the Supreme Court seeking quashing of a fresh FIR registered against him by Raza Educational Welfare Society secretary Irfan Abubakar Shaikh accusing him of disturbing communal harmony through his Hindi show on Republic Bharat by allegedly communalising the April 14 incident at Bandra railway station.Goswami is also facing probe in another case registered against him at Nagpur and transferred to Mumbai in connection with his alleged remarks against Congress president Sonia Gandhi during his shows on Republic TV on mob-lynching of two Hindu saints in Palghar, Maharashtra.The Supreme Court had on April 24 stayed all coercive action against Goswami for three weeks in connection with multiple FIRs by Congress workers but had allowed probe into the Nagpur FIR.Earlier this month, the Maharashtra Government had alleged before the Supreme Court that Goswami was attempting to “browbeat” Mumbai Police by “creating a fear psychosis”. On behalf of Goswami, senior advocate Harish Salve had alleged that he was being targeted due to political vendetta. "This is a political party targeting a journalist...all complainants are members of one political party (Congress). They have a problem with the government (Centre) and they want to teach this journalist (Arnab) a lesson," Salve had submitted.He had sought transfer of cases against Goswami to the CBI, saying there was a political problem between Maharashtra and the Centre. "I have been caught in crossfire.’’Salve had said interrogation of his client was done during lockdown. “Our apprehensions have turned out to be true. Two officers who questioned him were asymptomatic and now one has tested COVID19 positive.’’ Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had favoured handing over the probe to some other agency. If the court thought an offence was prima facie made out then it should be handled by an independent agency, Mehta had said.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing the Maharashtra government, had accused Goswami of sensationalising and stigmatising people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-transfer-cases-to-cbi-grants-protection-to-arnab-goswami-for-3-weeks-86912

19-05-2020||Kathmandu||Amid border row with India, Nepal approves new map with Lipulekh, Kalapani, Limpiyadhura in it||Nepal's Cabinet has endorsed a new political map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura under its territory, amidst a border dispute with India.The move announced by Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali came weeks after he said that efforts were on to resolve the border issue with India through diplomatic initiatives.Nepal's ruling Nepal Communist Party lawmakers have also tabled a special resolution in Parliament demanding return of Nepal's territory in Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh.The Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India. Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory - India as part of Uttarakhand's Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Dharchula district.Gyawali said that the official map of Nepal will soon be made public by the Ministry of Land Management. “Decision of the Council of Ministers to publish the map of Nepal in 7 provinces, 77 districts and 753 local level administrative divisions including Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani,” he wrote on Twitter on Monday.Gyawali last week summoned the Indian Ambassador Vinay Mohan Kwatra and handed over a diplomatic note to him to protest against the construction of a key road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand.India has said that the recently-inaugurated road section in Pithoragarh district in Uttarakhand lies completely within its territory.Nepal's Finance minister and government spokesperson Yuvaraj Khatiwada on Monday said that the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli has approved the new political map of the country.It was presented by Minister for Land Management Padma Aryal at a Cabinet meeting for endorsement at the official residence of Prime Minister Oli at Baluwatar here on Monday.The government said it will soon publicise the new political map that incorporates the territories unilaterally kept by India on its side of the border.Minister for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Yogesh Bhattarai said that the Cabinet's decision will be written in golden letters.However, senior Nepal Communist Party and member of Nepal Communist Party Standing Committee Ganesh Shah said the new move may escalate unnecessary tension between Nepal and India at a time when the country is fighting the coronavirus."The Nepal government should soon start a dialogue with India to resolve the matter through political and diplomatic moves," he said.The new map includes 335-km land area including Limpiyadhura in the Nepalese territory.The new map was drawn on the basis of the Sugauli Treaty of 1816 signed between Nepal and then the British India government and other relevant documents, which suggests Limpiyadhura, from where the Kali river originated, is Nepal's border with India, The Kathmandu Post quoted an official at the Ministry of Land Reform and Management as saying.President Bidhya Bhandari, addressing Parliament last week, reiterated that Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipulekh belong to Nepal and appropriate diplomatic measures will be adopted to resolve the existing issues with India.India and Nepal are at a row after the Indian side issued a new political map incorporating Kalapani and Lipulekh on its side of the border in October last year.The tension further escalated after India inaugurated a road link connecting Kailash Mansarovar, a holy pilgrimage site situated at Tibet, China, that passes through the territory belonging to Nepal.The 80-Km new road inaugurated by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh earlier this month is expected to help pilgrims visiting Kailash-Mansarovar in Tibet in China as it is around 90 kms from the Lipulekh pass."The road follows the pre-existing route used by the pilgrims of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra," spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said in New Delhi recently.

However the lives it claimed were far less due to the preparedness of the concerned agencies. Pointing to the praise India earned from the United Nations office for Disaster Risk Deduction (UNISDR) for the government’s and volunteers’ efforts that ensured the levels of destruction were minimum during Fani, officials said it was a difficult situation but one that India was well prepared to deal with.The IMD has warned West Bengal and Odisha to be prepared for extensive damage. Amphan is likely to uproot communication and power poles, disrupt rail and road links in many places and cause extensive damage to standing crops, plantations and orchards in the two states, it said.As many as 25 NDRF teams have been deployed on the ground, 12 others are ready in reserve while 24 are on standby in different parts of the country, as per the NDRF Director General According to IMD's classification, ‘Super Cyclone’ is the highest category of tropical storms, beginning with ‘Depression’ and intensifying further as ‘Deep Depression’, ‘Severe Cyclone’, ‘Very Severe Cyclone’ and ‘Extremely Severe Cyclone’. With still some time before the landfall, a slow progress and extended stay over the sea is expected to give Amphan ample space and time to intensify.Experts say Amphan is among the rare ‘Super Cyclones’ to form in the Bay. 'Extremely Severe Cyclone' Phailin in 2013 was the most intense tropical cyclone to make landfall in India after the 1999 Odisha 'Super Cyclone'.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/super-cyclone-to-weaken-over-next-six-hours-86884

It was therefore decided that the cadre should directly engage with affected sections and their leaders to explain the benefits of the Centre’s relief measures.

He, however, welcomed the call for an independent probe into the response to the pandemic saying learning was important.“The WHO is committed to transparency, accountability and continuous improvement. We welcome the proposed resolution before this Assembly, which calls for a step-wise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation. So, I will initiate an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment,” he said.The WHO chief’s remarks followed an address by Chinese President Xi Jinping who backed the review of global health response to Covid-19, but said such an evaluation should happen only after the pandemic was over.Under fire for late notification of the disease, Jinping said China acted with “openness and responsibility”.“China supports review of the global health response to Covid-19 after the pandemic is over. Such a review should be conducted in a scientific and impartial manner,” he said.Earlier, the WHO chief said the health body notified countries within 10 days and declared a global health emergency on January 30 when “there were less than 100 cases and no deaths outside China”. He said if the virus had taught humankind anything it was “humility”.The WHA has before it a draft resolution backed by 62 nations, including India, to identify the source of the virus and initiate an “impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation” of the WHO’s response to Covid-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-bows-to-calls-from-nations-for-virus-probe-86604

The statement came on Day 1 of Lockdown 4.0 as various states and UTs came out with different measures.‘Took them to Railway station’Seeking to explain the huge gathering of migrants at Ram Lila Grounds, DM Ajay Shankar Pandey said 9,000 people were called there to avoid overcrowding the railway station. “These migrants were to be transported in 6 Shramik trains — 3 each to Bihar and UP. After due process, they were taken on buses to the railway station. Everything went off smoothly,” he said.Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa announced that no one from Gujarat, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra would be allowed into the state, thus triggering a debate on inter-state travel. The announcement was on the lines of restrictions already in place in states like Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Delhi decided to allow taxis/autos, state transport buses to ply with restrictions on number of passengers. Shops were also allowed to open under the odd-even scheme.Reports from Kerala said the state permitted opening of shopping complexes at 50 per cent of their capacity, while West Bengal did away with the night curfew.In a letter to chief secretaries, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said, “As emphasised in my earlier letters, I would like to reiterate again that states and UTs cannot dilute restrictions imposed vide guidelines issued by the MHA. States and UTs, based on their assessment of the situation, may prohibit certain other activities in various zones, or impose such restrictions as deemed necessary. I would urge you to ensure compliance of the new guidelines and direct all authorities concerned for their strict implementation.”Under the new guidelines, the states and UTs will identify “red”, “orange” and “green” zones based on revised guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Sunday.Inside “red” and “orange” zones, containment and buffer zones will be identified by the district administration and local urban bodies, based on technical inputs obtained at the local level.In containment zones, strict control shall be maintained and no movement of persons allowed, except for medical emergencies and maintaining supply of essential goods and services.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-dilute-mha-curbs-states-told-86605

The map will depict Kalapani and Limphudhara that are also claimed by Nepal. TNSQuoting unnamed military sources, it said Chinese border defence troops have made necessary moves in response to “India’s recent, illegal construction of defence facilities across the border into Chinese territory in the Galwan Valley region”.“India is merely seeking to divert domestic attention due to its unsuccessful handling of Covid pandemic, and China has a military advantage there. So, the Indian military won’t escalate the incident,” it said, quoting Chinese analysts.The paper accused India of crossing the boundary in Galwan Valley of Ladakh. “The Indian side built defence fortifications and obstacles to disrupt Chinese border defence troops’ normal patrol, purposefully instigated conflict and attempted to unilaterally change the current border-control situation.”Indian media has also been reporting tension in the sector for the past one week.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has not commented on the flare-up, but it reacted to troop face-offs last week in two sectors by expressing confidence in the ability of the existing mechanism to resolve the issue.The MEA also suggested that the face-offs were not part of a grand strategy by explaining that these occasionally occur due to difference in perception of the LAC alignment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-daily-hints-at-new-lac-flashpoint-86608

It was first extended till May 3 and again till May 17.In March, the RBI had allowed a three-month moratorium on payment of all term loans due between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020.“With the lockdown now extended, we expect the RBI to extend the moratorium by three months,” SBI’s research report — Ecowrap — said.The moratorium for three more months will imply that companies need not pay till August 31, 2020, and this means that there is almost minimal possibility of companies being able to service their interest liabilities then in September.Failing to repay the interest liabilities will mean the account might be classified as non-performing loans as per the RBI norms.“Thus, the RBI needs to give operational flexibility to banks for a comprehensive restructuring of the existing loans and also a reclassification of 90-day norm,” the report said.The RBI’s June 7 circular is stringent and gives little flexibility to banks.“The revised restructuring norms should give banks to restructure like say converting interest liabilities up to March 2021 into term loans, repayable in three-five years for working capital and at the end of the tenor in case of term loans,” the report said.“The RBI also needs to clarify whether working capital expansions classify as Covid debt,” it said.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rbi-may-extend-moratorium-on-loans-by-3-months-report-86662

Most speakers, in fact, prioritised cheap availability of vaccines and continued hand-holding by the WHO.The proposal by 40 countries supplemented by a concerted media campaign to include Taiwan as an observer at the WHO General Assembly found little interest among delegates of over 100 countries when they were sounded out a night before the beginning of the two-day meet.As soon as the news broke that the WHO meet had put the Taiwan issue on the backburner, the US immediately condemned the decision and accused WHO DG Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of conspiring to exclude Taiwan. It also accused China of being “spiteful”.The US had begun changing its focus of attack from WHO DG Tedros after realising that it had led to a push back from African countries in favour of the Ethiopian.At the WHO meet on Monday, the general sense was that a review of the WHO’s handling of Covid could be taken up after nations finished dealing with the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/demand-for-cheap-vaccines-eclipses-us-bid-to-attack-who-86663
