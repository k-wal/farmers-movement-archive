25-07-2020||New Delhi/Nagpur/Kolkata||Weekend lockdown in several Indian states amid rapid surge in COVID cases||More high-risk areas were brought under lockdown on Saturday for varying periods, including weekends, by states in a bid to check the rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in India.Over a dozen states have so far opted for such selective lockdown citing the need to revive economic activities and at the same time reduce the risk of spread of infection, though Bihar and Manipur have imposed a state-wide shutdown from July 16 and July 23, respectively.In Madhya Pradesh, where Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan tested positive for coronavirus and was admitted to a hospital, a 10-day lockdown has been imposed in state capital Bhopal after a spike in cases. The state has been observing total shutdown on Sundays.A complete lockdown till Monday morning was imposed in Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, which too has been enforcing shutdown every Sunday.Tamil Nadu on Saturday breached the grim milestone of two lakh coronavirus cases with the biggest daily spike of 6,988 fresh infections, pushing the tally to 2,06,737, according to state officials.While Uttar Pradesh observed another weekend lockdown, similar curbs were imposed for the second time this month in Uttarakhand’s four districts—Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar districts—which have reported 1,348 cases since July 18.All shops were shut and transport suspended in West Bengal as part of the twice-a-week lockdown in the state.Jammu went into a 60-hour lockdown from Friday 6 pm, while a six-day complete lockdown has been imposed across the Kashmir Valley except Bandipora since Thursday.In its most recent update, the union health ministry placed the total number of cases at 13,36,861 and the death toll at 31,358.

But I have started reopening a few things gradually. Once reopened, it shouldn’t be shut again. Hence, I prefer taking steps in phases. You can’t just think about economy or health. There needs to be a balance between the two,” he said in an interview to Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.From June onwards, the government had started lifting the restrictions in phase-wise manner under its ‘Mission Begin Again’ initiative.A complete lockdown was imposed in Nagaland capital Kohima till July 31, while it will come into effect in Dimapur from Sunday till August 2. The Meghalaya government too has announced a complete lockdown in Shillong agglomeration from July 26 to July 29.In Chhattisgarh, a seven-day lockdown has been enforced from Wednesday in municipal limits of Raipur and Birgaon, besides 20 other urban bodies.Normal life came to a grinding halt in West Bengal on Saturday as shops were shut and all modes of transport went off the roads as part of the state government’s plan to clamp restrictions two days a week. A similar lockdown will take place place next Wednesday.More than 3,800 people were arrested for flouting lockdown guidelines on Thursday when it was first imposed.Flight operations at the Kolkata airport were also suspended during the lockdown. Police patrolled all major traffic intersections in the metropolis to keep a check on people coming out on the streets. Barricades were also put up in various parts of the state to stop people from coming out of their homes, officials said.West Bengal has so far registered 53,973 COVID-19 cases and 1,290 deaths till Friday.Odisha had ordered a complete 14-day lockdown in five districts of Ganjam, Khordha, Cuttack, Jajpur and Rourkela districts from July 17.According to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Saturday morning, Delhi has reported 1,28,389 cases, Karnataka 85,870, Andhra Pradesh 80,858, Uttar Pradesh 60,771, West Bengal 53,973, and Gujarat 53,545 cases.Karnataka has been enforcing a Sunday shutdown this month.  A week-long lockdown in Bengaluru had ended on July 22.The number of COVID-19 cases has gone up to 52,466 in Telangana, 34,178 in Rajasthan, 33,926 in Bihar, 29,755 in Haryana, 29,921 in Assam and 26,210 in Madhya Pradesh.Odisha has reported 22,693 infections, Jammu and Kashmir 16,782, Kerala 16,995, and Punjab 12,216.India’s first case of coronavirus was reported on January 30, and on March 25 the country was put under a 21-day complete lockdown, which was then extended periodically. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/weekend-lockdown-in-several-indian-states-amid-rapid-surge-in-covid-cases-117856
25-07-2020||Jaipur||Cong has created ‘atmosphere of anarchy’ in Rajasthan: BJP to governor||A delegation of the opposition BJP met Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra on Saturday and accused Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and the ruling Congress of creating an “atmosphere of anarchy” in the state.Mentioning the chief minister’s statement about people surrounding the Raj Bhawan over Mishra not summoning a session of the state assembly, the BJP said it was an attempt to “terrorise” the governor’s office.Gehlot and several Congress MLAs staged a sit-in at the Raj Bhawan here on Friday to press for an assembly session.Earlier in the day, Gehlot had claimed that the governor is facing pressure “from above” to stall the assembly from meeting, hinting at the alleged involvement of the BJP government at the Centre in the tussle for power in the state.Led by party state president Satish Poonia, the 15-member BJP delegation handed over a memorandum to the governor.It said the sit-in and slogan shouting by Congress MLAs were also attempts to “terrorise constitutional institutions”.“The drama which happened yesterday in the name of constitutional right was unfortunate. The note which was sent by the government to the governor for calling the assembly session had no agenda,” Leader of Opposition in the Rajasthan Assembly Gulab Chand Kataria told reporters after the meeting.He said demonstrations held by the Congress on Saturday against the BJP were the ruling party’s way to build pressure on the governor to call an assembly session.“It is the right of the cabinet to send a note to the governor for calling an assembly session but creating pressure to get it done immediately is the peak of violation of constitutional values,” he added.The Congress ended its sit-in after five hours after getting an assurance from the governor that he will go by the constitutional provisions on summoning an assembly session.Kataria also demanded Gehlot’s resignation.Asked if the BJP had sought President’s rule in the state, he said no such demand was raised.Deputy Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore asked what was the urgency to convene an assembly session at a time when there are nearly 35,000 COVID-19 cases in the state.“They have created an atmosphere of anarchy in the state,” he said.He said the BJP did not seek a floor test in the assembly.The BJP also discussed with the governor the spread of coronavirus in the state, Poonia said.“We gave the memorandum to the governor and said that there is a need to control the spread of coronavirus,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-has-created-atmosphere-of-anarchy-in-rajasthan-bjp-to-governor-117855

Above all he was a dedicated Congressman who served the party devotedly in various capacities," Sonia said in her message.Reddy went on to read Sonia’s message saying, "PV Narasimha Rao was a much respected national and international figure. The Congress party takes pride in his many accomplishments and contributions. The birth centenary of Rao is an occasion to recall and pay tribute to a most scholarly and erudite personality who after a long career in state and national politics (became) the Prime Minister of the country at a time of grave economic crisis."The message noted that the Union Budget of July 24, 1991, paved the way for the economic transformation of India.Rao, noted Sonia in her message, was the second Prime Minister in this country to introduce radical reforms in the Indian economy to unleash the potentiality of growth.The message from the Congress president has started a war of words between the TRS and the Congress leadership with the former alleging that the Congress did not even remember the great leader from Telangana till KCR decided to hold various events in his memory.Born in Laknepalli village of Narsampet Mandal in Warangal district, now in Telangana, Rao was trained as a lawyer but switched to politics and rose to become the ninth Prime Minister of India and the first from south India and the second holder of the office from a non-Hindi-speaking region.During his tenure, he brought major reforms in the economy, abolished license Raj and improved national security.

Making allowance for the pandemic, we grant further time of two months for issuing requisite notification,” the bench said.The tribunal warned that if no notification is issued before January 6, the next date, the Joint Secretary, MoRTH concerned will have to remain present in person and explain why action be not taken for unnecessary delay.It further said the stand of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee shows that clandestine activities are still being found for which vigilance may be strengthened.Noting that the number of “end of life vehicles” will be over 21 million by 2025, the NGT had directed the government to formulate a standard operating procedure (SOP) for setting up authorised recycling centres to scrap them scientifically.It had said the scrapping of vehicles in a scientific manner needs to be taken up on organized basis as the current capacity is hardly adequate.The NGT had taken note of an English newspaper report about the scrap business in Mayapuri and initiated proceedings on its own. — PTI\||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ngt-slams-road-ministry-over-delay-in-guidelines-on-scrapping-of-vehicles-117810

In the present case, several layers of conspiracy have surfaced and to unearth the deep rooted conspiracy, interrogation of remaining is important for the purpose to investigate the present case from all possible angles.  “Search of other co-accused persons of this case is going on but due to lockdown COVID-19 period, process of searches in other states is hindered,” the police told the court.The police said that voluminous data, in the form of CDRs, WhatsApp chats, Facebook posts, Twitter accounts and other social media, was collected during the probe.“More than 1,700 call details records were sought from the service providers which are being thoroughly under examination. The analysis of such a huge technical record is going on and will take more time. “The detailed analysis of that data is important for the purpose of filing a fair, effective and impartial charge sheet against the above named accused and his continued detention is needed to confront him with incriminating material so detected,” it said.             Police further said that “suspicious funds to the tune of Rs 7 to 8 lakh which the accused received through office receipts but not deposited in the MAJMI bank account”.“Moreover, bills were created to manage that suspicious fund. The persons concerned, related to these bills, are being examined but due to pandemic COVID-19, process of getting details and examination of witnesses is slow,” it said. Police told the court that apart from 23 protest sites reported earlier, two more protest sites have also been identified which were brought up as a part of conspiracy for riots.           “All the sites were managed, controlled and organised by multiple layer teams in a well-structured and systematic manner. Each individual layer team has been assigned role to perform in furtherance of executing the conspiracy.  The investigation regarding identification of the persons involved in this deep rooted conspiracy and their role in furtherance of conspiracy is being minutely under investigation,” it said.During the course of investigation conducted so far, role of Sharjeel Imam has also surfaced in the hatching of the conspiracy of this case, police said.It told the court that Imam has been declared coronavirus positive, which has also “derailed the investigation to a huge extent”.In the FIR, police have claimed that the communal violence was a ‘premeditated conspiracy’ which was allegedly hatched by former JNU student leader Umar Khalid and two others.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

25-07-2020||Vibha Sharma||Jairam Ramesh places on record his ‘strongest objections’ on draft EIA notification||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 25Putting on record his “strongest objections” to the draft EIA notification 2020, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change Jairam Ramesh on Saturday said proposed changes in environmental clearance process for infrastructure projects “will routinely legitimise illegality and promote land grab, not development”. “Environmental regulation is not an unnecessary burden but an essential obligation for the health and welfare of our people and sustainable development,” Ramesh cautioned in a letter to Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar and marked to Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah NaiduThe former Environment Minister said the proposed changes are not based on audits, assessments and analyses or any research but reflected a mindset that sees environmental regulation as an unnecessary regulatory burden. “The Chairman of the Rajya Sabha very recently in his characteristic style said nature plus culture is equal to future.  I am marking a copy of this letter to him as well so as to let him know how the equation he has so rightly and nicely formulated will be thrown out of the window if the draft EIA Notification 2020 becomes a reality,” Ramesh said, calling it his “duty to place on record” his objections“The draft notification allows post facto approvals that go against very principle of assessment and public participation prior to environment clearance and has provisions that will routinely legitimise illegality,” he said.“It reduces public participation in all steps of the environment clearance process by lessening the notice period for public hearing and doing away with them with a large category of projects and does away with environment impact assessment altogether in very many cases of expansion,” he added. Ramesh said it increases validity of environment clearances allowing projects to “secure” land for long duration even when they are not constructed. “This promotes land grab, not development and gives the Union government full powers to appoint State Environmental Impact Assessment Authorities. This is yet another nail in the coffin of cooperative federalism,” he said.   The Narendra Modi government’s attempt to overhaul the environmental clearance process has received widespread criticism from environmental experts.One of the main objectives of the draft is to bring under regulation industries or projects which have violated the EIA 2006 notification by starting construction work before environmental clearance is granted or by expanding capacity.Experts are questioning various provisions, including for post-facto project clearance, doing away with the mandatory process of public consultation for a wide range of projects and increasing validity of the environment clearances.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jairam-ramesh-places-on-record-his-strongest-objections-on-draft-eia-notification-117803

25-07-2020||---||India’s COVID-19 testing hits record high of 4.20 lakh samples a day||New Delhi, July 25India has gradually ramped-up its testing capacity for COVID-19 and conducted over 4.20 lakh tests in a day---the highest ever---the Union Health Ministry said Saturday, crediting the increase in number of labs for the achievement.India had only one lab for testing samples for the disease in January but it has now increased the number to 1,301, including private labs. The Health Ministry said revised guidelines by ICMR and all-round efforts by states also aided in widespread testing.Till Friday, a total of 1,58,49,068 tests for COVID-19 had been done in the country.India did 3.50 lakh tests every day over the last one week, the ministry said.With 4,20,898 samples tested in the past 24 hours, it added, the Tests Per Million (TPM) has increased to 11,485 and continue to maintain an upward trend.“The Union government has advised all state and UT governments to keep up the strategy of ‘Test, Track and Treat’ with aggressive testing which may lead to higher number of daily positive cases initially but would eventually achieve a decline as has been demonstrated after the central government’s targeted efforts in the NCT of Delhi,” the ministry said in a statement.With increased testing of samples for COVID-19, the fatality rate has significantly dropped to 2.35 per cent on Saturday and the recovery rate has surged to 63.54 per cent.                “India has one of the lowest fatality rates in the world,” the health ministry said.The downward trend in fatality rate means the collective efforts of the Centre and state and UT governments have checked the mortality due to COVID-19, it stated.A total of 8,49,431 COVID-19 patients have recovered.The recoveries exceed the active cases by 3,93,360.However, with 48,916 fresh cases, India’s COVID-19 tally zoomed past 13 lakh on Saturday, just two days after it crossed the 12-lakh mark, while the death toll mounted to 31,358, the ministry said.

25-07-2020||New Delhi||Online convention to pay homage to former president APJ Abdul Kalam||‘Mission Kalam’, an online convention celebrating the life and time of the 11th President of India APJ Abdul Kalam was inaugurated on Saturday.The convention will be hosted by Los Angeles-based Pink Jaguars Entertainment, the banner behind the former president's upcoming biopic “APJ Abdul Kalam: The Missile Man”.The event will take place for eleven weekends with eleven online sessions starting from July 25, the day when Kalam took charge as the 11th president in 2002, to October 15, which marks his 89th birth anniversary.“This convention will have leaders from various areas of expertise to share their experiences on Dr Kalam, who was known as the ‘Missile Man of India’,” Suvarna Pappu, managing director, Pink Jaguars Entertainment, said in the Zoom session.The virtual inauguration was attended by Vellaichamy Ponraj, ADA scientist and former technical advisor to Kalam; Shekhar Rao Perala, ex vice-chairperson-Nehru Yuva Kendra Sanghatan (NYKS) and national executive member, BJP; Vasa Seshagiri Rao, IRS, Chief Commissioner CGST, Hyderabad Zone; Shaina NC, spokesperson BJP; director-writer of biopic, Jagadeesh Daneti; and actor Mohammed Ali, who essays the role of Kalam in the film.Reminiscing his journey with the former president, Vellaichamy said it was a life-changing experience to work with Kalam and co-author the book “Manifesto of Change” with him.“I was in 10th standard when SLV-3 was launched and I had a dream to become a scientist like Dr Kalam. I never knew I will be travelling with him for 20 years after joining DRDO. His mission was to make India self-reliant in aeronautics, defence and atomic energy. I hope the biopic will inspire youth across the globe as the growth of science and technology is parallel to the growth of Kalam,” Vellaichamy said.Perala said Kalam shared a great bond with every citizen of India and he is looking forward to the biopic.“He was a man of simple living and high thinking. He was a man of actions and not just words. Dr Kalam is an inspiration for people across the world. He is loved by everyone in India. The biopic being made on him can inspire many young minds,” he added.The first look poster of the biopic was released by Minister for Information & Broadcasting of India, Prakash Javadekar earlier this year in February.Politician-fashion designer, Shaina NC, said while the biopic was a great step to make people aware about Kalam’s journey, a lot more is needed to be done to “understand” what he stood for.“At this given point in time, there are very few people who understand the relevance of Dr Kalam. Post COVID-19, life has changed and we have realised the power of simplicity. It is important to think about the past and realise that there are legends who are remembered for their sheer simplicity and brilliant vision,” she added.Biopic’s director Daneti also revealed the film’s international title at the online inaugural ceremony of ‘Mission Kalam’.The film, produced by Daneti, Pappu and Martini Films’ Johnny Martin, will be released in the US under the title “Immortal President”.

25-07-2020||Mumbai||Won’t lift lockdown just to address economic concerns: Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday said he was not in favour of complete lifting of the COVID-induced lockdown in the state only to address economic concerns.He said there was a need to strike a balance between the issues related to health and economy considering the challenge posed by the pandemic.“I will never say that the lockdown will be lifted completely. But I have started reopening a few things gradually. Once reopened, it shouldn’t be shut again. Hence, I prefer taking steps in phases. You can’t just think about the economy or health. There needs to be a balance between the two,” he said.Thackeray made this statement in an interview published in Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ on Saturday.The ongoing lockdown in the state will continue until July 31. From June onwards, the government had started lifting the restrictions in a phase-wise manner under its ‘Mission Begin Again’ initiative.“This pandemic is a global war. It has affected the entire world. Those countries which had lifted the lockdown in haste thinking that it was over, were again forced to impose it to curb the spread. In Australia, they had to rope in the Army,” he said.“Many people are opposing lockdown. They say the lockdown is affecting the economy. To such people, I would say that I am ready to lift the lockdown but if people die due to it, would you take the responsibility? Even we are concerned about the economy,” he said.On the restarting of the suburban railway network in Mumbai, he said: “What if families fall ill and their houses are sealed? Therefore, everything would be done step-by-step.”Speaking about his government which has completed six months in office, Thackeray said that he was leading a three-party alliance government supported by some independents.“This is not just Thackeray sarkar, but everybody’s sarkar, especially that of the citizens of the state, who have accepted this experiment,” he added.After the assembly polls last year, the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress came together to form the government in the state.Thackeray said the six-month period has been full of challenges like the coronavirus pandemic and Nisarga cyclone, which hit the coastal parts of the state on June 3.“I am not bothered about the political challenges. People have faith in me,” he said.Talking about the coronavirus situation in Mumbai, he said: “There was never a need to call the Army in Mumbai. I am proud of the administration which rose to the challenge and set up jumbo field hospitals for treatment of COVID-19 patients in the city.”Speaking about the criticism that he has not been to the Mantralaya, the state secretariat, during the pandemic, the Chief Minister said the technology helped people in doing all work and there was no need to travel.“I can be at home and cover the entire state with the help of technology and take quick decisions. I am not saying one shouldn’t move out. But when you go out, you are at one place only while through video-conference you can go everywhere,” he said.“I am not bothered what critics say till people trust me. I am honest with my work,” he added.On starting the academic year during the pandemic, Thackeray said e-learning was the only option.When asked about leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis’s recent visit to Delhi, Thackeray said sarcastically that he might have gone there to take stock of the coronavirus situation in the national capital.“He goes to Delhi and speaks about Maharashtra’s COVID-19 situation since he has given his MLA funds in Delhi,” the CM said in an apparent reference to BJP MLAs donating to PM Cares Fund and not to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.“Recently, a survey listed Maharashtra Chief Minister as the best CM in the country. This caused stomach pain to many,” he said.“Coronavirus has many symptoms. Stomach ache may be one of them. Loss of taste is also a symptom,” he said sarcastically when he was asked if life has become tasteless for some since the MVA government came to power.Thackeray also rejected the criticism that his government had hidden the number of coronavirus victims.“The WHO and the Washington Post have taken note of the state government’s efforts,” Thackeray said.

25-07-2020||Washington||US won't allow new students into country for online-only classes||The United States will not allow the entry of new international students for the upcoming fall semester if their courses are entirely online, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said.In a release, the ICE on Friday said "F and M students in new or initial status after March 9, 2020, will not be able to enter the United States to enrol in a US school as a non-immigrant student for the fall term to pursue a full course of study that is 100 percent online," Xinhua news agency reported.It also said school officials should not issue a Form I-20, "Certificate of Eligibility for Non-immigrant Student Status," for a student in new or initial status who is outside of the United States and plans to take classes at an certified educational institution fully online.A guidance issued on March 9, 2020 by the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), which the ICE uses to manage foreign students and exchange visitors in the United States, has allowed schools and students to engage in distance learning in excess of regulatory limits due to the coronavirus pandemic.The ICE said on Friday that the guidance applies to continuing F and M non-immigrant students who were in valid F-1 or M-1 nonimmigrant status on March 9, 2020, including those previously enrolled in entirely online classes who are outside of the United States and seeking to re-enter the country this fall."Students actively enrolled at a US school on March 9, 2020, who subsequently took courses online while outside of the country can re-enter the United States, even if their school is engaged solely in distance learning," it added.The announcement came less than two weeks after the ICE rescinded a new directive that could have denied international students their stay in the United States if they only attend online courses in this year's fall semester.The directive, which came as the White House was pushing for the reopening of schools despite the pandemic, had met strong backlash from both home and abroad as well as lawsuits supported by more than 200 universities and 18 states.As the coronavirus pandemic continues to surge in the United States, many universities have announced plans to hold most or all classes online this fall to protect the health and safety of their students and faculty.Rakesh Khurana, Danoff Dean of Harvard College, said in a letter to students that "any incoming student who received a Form I-20 to begin their studies this fall will be unable to enter the US in F-1 status as course instruction is fully remote.""We abhor any policies that seek to force us to choose between our community's health and the education of our international students. The University is working closely with members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation to extend the online exemption to newly admitted students and ensure that this flexibility remains in place for the duration of the public health emergency," Khurana said. "Unfortunately, we don't anticipate any change to the policy in time for the fall semester."

The current leader of AQIS is Osama Mahmood…, who succeeded the late Asim Umar…AQIS is reportedly planning retaliation operations in the region to avenge the death of its former leader,” it said.According to the report, “One member state reported that the ISIL Indian affiliate (Hind Wilayah), which was announced on May 10, 2019, has between 180 and 200 members.”It said there are “significant numbers of ISIL operatives in Kerala and Karnataka states.”In May last year, the Islamic State (also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh) terror group claimed to have established a new "province" in India, the first-of-its-kind announcement that came after clashes between militants and security forces in Kashmir.The dreaded terror outfit, through its Amaq News Agency, had said that the Arabic name of the new branch is "Wilayah of Hind" (India Province).A senior Jammu and Kashmir police officer had rejected the claim.Prevously, ISIS attacks in Kashmir were linked to its so-called Khorasan Province branch, which was set up in 2015 to cover "Afghanistan, Pakistan and nearby lands".

25-07-2020||New Delhi||IIT Madras start-up generates Rs 22-cr funding for launching wrist band for detecting COVID symptoms||A wearable wrist tracker to detect COVID-19 symptoms at an early stage will be available in the market next month with its developer, an IIT Madras incubated start-up, raising funding of Rs 22 crore for the purpose.“Muse Wearables”, the start-up incubated at IIT Madras by an alumni group, along with an NIT Warangal alumnus, is planning to launch the trackers in 70 countries.The wrist-based tracker has sensors for skin temperature, heart rate and SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation) which can continuously track these body vitals remotely to help in early diagnosis of COVID-19 symptoms.The tracker will be Bluetooth-enabled and can be connected to the mobile phone via an app called the Muse Health App. The user vitals and activity data are stored on the phone as well as a remote server. Administrative access can also be provided for centralized monitoring of people in containment areas for COVID-19 symptoms.The tracker can get notifications from the Arogya Setu app and alert the user when he/she enters a COVID containment zone.Users can raise an emergency alert (SOS) in case of any difficulty and the alert is raised when body temperature is higher than the threshold. The app also alerts people when SpO2 levels are too low or when the user is entering into a COVID containment area.“We are targeting two lakh product sales this year with plans to achieve 10 lakh product sales by 2022 across the world. The investors believe in our innovations and believe that we can create a huge difference in the consumer tech space and we have been able to generate funding of Rs 22 crore,” KLN Sai Prasanth, an IIT Madras alumni.Priced at around Rs 3,500, the new wearable product will be available in the market for consumers across 70 countries by August.K Prathyusha, an NIT Warangal graduate, said: “Our main objective with this product is to facilitate identification of patients who have COVID pneumonia sooner so that they can be treated more effectively.”“We have developed algorithms to estimate body temperature from the skin and ambient temperature, heart rate and motion sensing. With continuous temperature and SpO2 monitoring, we will be able to detect silent hypoxia (an early symptom of coronavirus infection even in asymptomatic patients) at an early stage. This will also help the general public for proactive health monitoring along with fitness tracking and sleep tracking,” Prathyusha said.

25-07-2020||Vibha Sharma||MHA forwards BJP leader RP Singh’s letter to SIT, DCP Anti-Riots Cell||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 25There has been a new development in the 1984 Anti-Sikh riots case. The Home Ministry has forwarded the letter written by senior BJP leader RP Singh regarding the action taken on the Justice Dhingra Committee to the SIT formed by it in 2015 and also the DCP of the Anti-Riots Cell.Talking to The Tribune, Singh called it a “big step forward in the case”.Investigation needed to be carried out on the invisible hand, the one who directed local Congress leaders to carry out the massacre in Delhi, Singh added.   In February 2015, the Narendra Modi government ordered a Special Investigation Team (SIT) into cases related to anti-Sikh riots that broke out after the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984.In 2018, the SC constituted the Justice Dhingra Committee to probe the 186 cases in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. The Committee submitted its report to the Supreme Court in January 2020.Last week, Singh, who is also the “intervenor”, wrote to Shah regarding action taken by the Government of India against culprits in the case “as promised”.The government must take action as promised without any further delay on an urgent basis, Singh said, calling the letter a “reminder, seeking immediate action to be taken by the Centre, as stated, by the Solicitor General on behalf of the MHA, before the Supreme Court in January”.Singh also urged the Centre to form a new SIT to ascertain the “invisible hand” behind the organised massacre. “It is also prayed keeping in mind that even after more than 30 years of impunity, justice to the Sikh community has not been given,” he said.According to the BJP national secretary, the report submitted by the Justice Dhingra Committee “clearly and unarguably put forward a case in favour of the petitioners, displaying explicitly how various functionaries of the state, namely, the Judiciary, the Police and the state were working hand-in-glove not only to aid such a gruesome hate crime against a minority community but also successfully manage to shirk off the accountability for the same by giving clearance to the accused”.“As the report makes it abundantly clear, it is reiterated that the violence, riots as well as the clearance to the persons involved, limited not only to the rioters, were indeed orchestrated and cleared by an invisible hand from the very top of the government in power during that time. It is submitted that instead of holding those responsible for the violence to account, many police officials and other persons involved have been promoted over the last 30 years,” he said.The long roadThe Supreme Court in its order dated January 11, 2018, constituted a three-member SIT with the direction “to proceed as regards the further investigation in respect of 186 cases and submit its report within two months”.The committee was formally notified by the MHA on February 9, 2018.Two members of the Committee joined in February, however, the third member did not join stating personal grounds.On the intervention of Singh, the Supreme Court on December 4, 2018, changed the constitution of the Committee to two-member, which included former Delhi High Court judge Justice Dhingra and IPS Abhishek Dular.On December 14, 2018, the MHA re-notified the Committee.The MHA on January 15, 2020, informed the Supreme Court that it accepted the report of the SIT which implicated several Delhi police personnel in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and said it would take action accordingly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mha-forwards-bjp-leader-rp-singhs-letter-to-sit-dcp-anti-riots-cell-117755

But the SOG said he was yet to divulge whom he met there.“We brought him here as part of the investigations to confirm if he had come here for a meeting. He himself led us to the other resort near ITC Grand Bharat. He says he came here but did not meet anyone. We are investigating,” said ADG (SOG) Ashok Rathore.Jain alias Sanjay Bardia was nabbed a week ago after his name surfaced in a viral audio clip purportedly mentioning about horse-trading of legislators to topple the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan.Also read: Gehlot cabinet to meet again; races against time to answer governor's 6 queriesFutile for people to expect safety if CM himself makes guv ‘feel unsafe’: Shekhawat attacks GehlotHailing from Bikaner, Jain is a known power broker.

However, he is believed to be close to both senior Congress and BJP leaders of the state.Sources claimed Jain had identified and named the staff of the resort who led him in but said there was nobody inside and he met none.

25-07-2020||---||In fresh proposal to Guv, Rajasthan Cabinet recommends assembly session from July 31||New Delhi, July 25The Rajasthan Cabinet has sent a fresh proposal to Governor Kalraj Mishra, recommending assembly session from July 31.Earlier, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, on Saturday, said he would foil the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) plan of toppling the state government and even “go to the President, if required”.Addressing the MLAs at Fairmont Hotel, Gehlot said if required we would stay in the hotel for 21 more days. The MLAs hailed the Chief Minister by raising their hands. The legislators are camping at the hotel to block any attempt of poaching.Governor Kalraj Mishra had posed six questions and consulted legal experts on Friday on the cabinet’s four-line resolution to call a session.After a marathon meeting of the cabinet last night, Gehlot called another meeting to send a request and recommendation to the Governor about calling a session.The trickiest clarification the Governor has sought pertains to why the Chief Minister wants to call a session to prove majority when he has the majority already. The governor’s import in the question is that no one was asking the government to prove majority, so why should there be a rush.Also read: Futile for people to expect safety if CM himself makes guv ‘feel unsafe’: Shekhawat attacks GehlotRajasthan cops bring horse-trading accused Sanjay Jain to Manesar; he 'admits' to visiting resortThe Chief Minister says he needs to end the political uncertainty created by the rebellion of 19 MLAs, including Sachin Pilot, and that some rebels want to come back but are being held captive in Haryana by the ruling BJP.Chief Minister Gehlot feels a floor test will clear everything and will secure the government for six months.Another poser by the Governor is — what’s your agenda for the session and what’s the date from which you want it? The state cabinet's earlier note doesn’t mention either.Yet another point of contention is his direction to the state government to ensure independent movements of MLAs so that they cast their vote freely and not under duress.The rebel MLAs are incommunicado and the Congress wants to get them to the assembly, issue a fresh whip for the floor test and force them to take a public stand because dissidents have been saying they don’t want to join the BJP.Mishra has also told the state to give him a detailed plan of how COVID-19 safety norms will be followed should the session be called.Governor’s six posers1. Cabinet note doesn’t mention date from which the session is proposed to be called2. Cabinet note doesn’t explain why the session is being called at such short notice and what’s the agenda? Normally a 21-day notice is mandatory to call a session.3. What’s the justification to call a session to prove majority when the state government has the majority?4. Governor has directed the state government to assure the provision of arrangements for independent movement of all MLAs for the session.5. Governor has directed the government to consider pending SC proceedings involving some MLAs and also provide details of COVID safety norms the state will implement for the session.6. Raj Bhavan has asked the government to ensure everything is done within the constitutional remit. — With inputs from IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-fresh-proposal-to-guv-rajasthan-cabinet-recommends-assembly-session-from-july-31-117748

25-07-2020||Washington||US court rejects bail plea of 26/11 accused Rana being sought by India||A US court has rejected the US$ 1.5 million bail application of Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, who has been declared a fugitive by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack case, describing him a flight risk.Rana, 59, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed.He is a declared fugitive in India.US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chooljian, in her 24-page order dated July 21, denied bail to Rana arguing that he is a flight risk.Describing Rana as a flight risk, the US government opposed his release on bail, arguing that if he were to flee to Canada, he may escape the possibility of a death sentence in India.“Given the stakes, an allowance of bail in any amount would not guarantee Rana's presence in court. Granting bail would invite the possibility of embarrassing the United States in the conduct of its foreign affairs, straining its relationship with India,” Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian had told the court.On the other hand, Rana's attorney told the court that the 26/11 accused is not a flight risk and has proposed a USD 1.5 million bond for his release.Rana, in his defence, has argued that the US' decision not to extradite his co-conspirator, Headley, to India is inconsistent and bars his extradition.While Rana “has presented a robust bail package and proffered conditions which significantly mitigate the risk of flight, the court cannot find that he has negated the risk of flight and accordingly grants the Detention Request (of the government) on that basis,” Judge Chooljian said.For someone facing conspiracy to murder and murder charges in India, the incentive to flee to avoid extradition is strong, the court said.Pakistan-born Rana completed Army Medical College there, and served in the Pakistani Army as a doctor for more than a decade, but eventually deserted.He is currently a Canadian citizen, but was a resident of Chicago where he had a business. According to the court papers, he has also resided in and traveled to Canada, Pakistan, Germany and England and speaks seven languages.If he flees to Canada, he could effectively avoid exposure to the death penalty as such country's extradition treaty with India contains a provision which allows extradition to be refused if the offence for which extradition is requested is punishable by death in India and is not punishable by death in Canada unless India gives assurances that a death penalty would not be executed, federal prosecutors had said. “There is no question in the court's mind that given” Rana's significant foreign ties, particularly to Canada, and the potential death penalty awaiting him in India if he is extradited on and convicted of the most serious pending charges, he is a flight risk, the court said.According to the court papers, Rana had tested positive for COVID-19 at Terminal Island in Los Angeles on April 28, 2020, but was asymptomatic and has since recovered.He tested negative in the last three tests on June 13, June 15 and June 25.According to the federal prosecutors, between 2006 and November 2008, Rana conspired with Headley, also known as "Daood Gilani”, and others in Pakistan to assist Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Harakat ul-Jihad-e-Islami, both US-designated terrorist organisations, to plan and carry out the Mumbai terrorist attacks.Pakistani-American LeT terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.India seeks his arrest on a number of offences, including the conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit forgery for the purpose of cheating, and murder under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

25-07-2020||New Delhi||Manmohan calls PV Narasimha Rao father of economic reforms in India||Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today inaugurated the birth centenary celebrations of late PM PV Narasimha Rao remembering how this very day 29 years ago he presented the historic Union Budget that ushered economic liberalisation in India.He described Rao as son of the soil, an important member of the Congress and truly the father of economic reforms in India. The former PM said Rao worked closely with late PMs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi and later led the party to a 244-seat performance in the 1991 Lok Sabha elections held after Rajiv’s assassination.Speaking at the first formal event the Congress ever organised in the memory of Rao, Manmohan Singh said, “I am particularly happy that this programme has been organised on the day on which I had the privilege, as the Finance Minister of India, of presenting the first budget of Rao’s government in 1991.”Hailing Rao for bold leadership and ability to carry everyone along, he said, “It was a budget that ushered in liberalisation. It was a hard choice and a bold decision and it was possible because Prime Minister Narasimha Rao ji gave me the freedom to roll out things.”He added, “It was a precariously placed minority government dependent on outside support, yet Rao was able to carry everyone along, convincing them with his conviction. Enjoying his confidence, I went about my job to carry forward his vision. He can truly be called the father of economic reforms in India.”“Mindful of the troubled relationship between the Congress under Sonia Gandhi and Rao (whose body was not allowed at the AICC headquarters for last respects), he spoke of the late leader being “an important member of the Congress”.Manmohan Singh said Rao was chosen the Congress president after Rajiv’s assassination, halfway through the 1991 Lok Sabha election. “The party won 244 seats. Though Rao himself did not contest the elections, he was the Congress president. He became the automatic choice to become the PM on June 21, 1991. It was on this day that he made me his FM,” recalled Manmohan.Earlier, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, in her message to the Telangana Congress, which began the birth centenary celebrations of Rao, said Rao was a dedicated Congress man.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/manmohan-calls-pv-narasimha-rao-father-of-economic-reforms-in-india-117594

Manpriya SinghAmala Shankar was five decades ahead of her times. The renowned danseuse took to stage in an era when girls were not even allowed on the streets. The artiste brought international acclaim to Indian fusion dance form that millions were not even introduced to. On Friday, the dance fraternity was left with a void with the danseuse’s demise at the age of 101 in Kolkata. Granddaughter Sreenanda Shankar’s tweet echoed with many when she said, “Today my thamma left us… this is an end of an era.”Born Amala Nandy in 1919 in Jessore, Bangladesh, she had a bent towards arts and music from a very early age. However, it was only with the encouragement from her father that she was able to be a path-breaker and pursue dance further. Sajal Koser, Secretary, Pracheen Kala Kendra, says, “Amala Shankar was not just instrumental in popularising Indian fusion dance but also in bringing alive several social issues on stage.”It was in 1931 at the age of 12 when Amala met Uday Shankar in Paris. Little she must have known then that it was his dance institute she was soon going to attend in Almora and one day become his partner for life. On June 27, the family of the danseuse celebrated her birthday with an exhibition of her rare photographs that highlighted her painting talent. The exhibition gave an insight into her paintings which were made using fingers instead of brushes.Senior Kathak exponent Dr Shobha Koser recalls meeting Amala only two years ago, “It was her daughter Mamata Shankar’s performance in Kolkata and I had the honour of sitting right next to her. Though she didn’t speak, she greeted and articulated through her gestures. Pretty much like her performances.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/she-put-indian-fusion-dance-on-world-map-117599
25-07-2020|| & PTIJaipur||Gehlot insists on session, Governor asks why||Congress MLAs loyal to Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday held a five-hour sit-in at Raj Bhavan to press for an Assembly session, in a dramatic show of strength hours after the Pilot camp secured protection for now from disqualification from the House.Read also: The Rajasthan High Court ordered that status quo should be maintained on the disqualification notices sent out by the Speaker, delivering a small victory to Sachin Pilot and 18 other Congress MLAs who wanted them quashed.Guv’s contentionWhy session when in majority?Why such short notice?No date or agenda mentionedNo mention of Cabinet approvalThis means that the dissidents will hold on to the membership of the state Assembly till there is a court ruling in the matter that is now also before the Supreme Court. But after the high court ruling, focus quickly shifted to Raj Bhavan as Congress MLAs landed there from the hotel where they are holed up.The Congress said it ended the sit-in following an assurance from Governor Kalraj Mishra that he would abide by Article 174 of the Constitution, after getting some clarifications from the CM. The provision deals with the Governor’s role in summoning a session.After the MLAs dispersed, the Governor sent a letter to CM Gehlot, seeking clarifications on the session. The missive included a query on why the government wanted the session summoned for a vote of confidence when it claimed it had a majority.AICC spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the queries would be taken care at a state Cabinet meeting to be called shortly.Gehlot had earlier accused the Governor of sitting on a recommendation from the Cabinet to call the session while the Congress MLAs wanted to attend a sitting and “establish” that they were in majority. He also claimed that the Governor was facing pressure “from above” to stall the Assembly from meeting, hinting at the involvement of the BJP government at the Centre in the tussle for power in the state. Before heading for Raj Bhavan, Gehlot said he had requested the Governor on Thursday to call the session on Monday, but there had been no word from Governor House.He said if people “gherao” Raj Bhavan over the issue, the MLAs “will not be responsible”, a remark that prompted the BJP to demand that the Centre should deploy the CRPF. “It should not trust the Rajasthan Police,” Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria said.At Raj Bhavan, Gehlot met the Governor inside while the MLAs remained on the lawns. Altogether, the CM and the other MLAs remained there for about five hours.The Congress has 107 MLAs in the 200-member House and the BJP 72. The Congress tally includes six Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs, who merged as a group with the ruling party after the 2018 Assembly poll, lending stability to the Gehlot government.On Friday, BJP MLA Madan Dilawar moved the high court, complaining that Speaker CP Joshi had not acted on his petition seeking the disqualification of the MLAs from the BSP. The court will take up the MLA’s petition next week.Before giving a ruling on the Pilot camp’s petition, Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta allowed its application for including the Union government in the list of respondents.Meanwhile, the Rajasthan Congress today said it would hold protests across district headquarters on Saturday to claim their democratic rights in the light of “murder of democracy” in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gehlot-insists-on-session-governor-asks-why-117554

The resorts have been asked to not just submit the CCTV footage but also the booking record.

We have asked the hotel officials to provide us the necessary details. Our teams stationed at Delhi and Manesar since the past one week have been either stopped or intercepted.”The Rajasthan police had pressed into service three agencies for tracing the rebel MLAs, especially Sharma, whose name figures in FIRs lodged over alleged horse-trading to topple the Gehlot government. These relate to two audio clips. The SOG arrived at Manesar last Friday to collect Sharma’s voice sample but was stopped by the Haryana Police.After a showdown, the team was allowed inside ITC Grand Bharat but found nobody there. It accused the local police of intentionally holding them up to help Sharma flee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sog-notice-to-resorts-housing-rebel-mlas-117555
