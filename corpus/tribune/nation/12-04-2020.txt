The food for captive animals is sanitised at the gates before being brought in to be served to them. Zoo keepers who handle them are also being subjected to regular thermal screening to check if they have any symptoms of corona,” Patro said.He said if the need to quarantine animals arises the rescue centres can be used for the purpose.Strict guidelines have been issued to the staff to inform the authorities if they spot the carcass of an animal within the reserve or at its peripheries. They have been asked to inform the Director if they see signs of illness in an animal, he said.According to an official estimate, there are around 250 tigers and 1,100 elephants in Corbett Tiger Reserve while there are 38 tigers and 450 elephants in Rajaji.

There has been slight dislocation of a couple of weeks but all the major contracts will be on schedule, we don’t anticipate any problem on that,” Indian Ambassador to Russia Bala Venkatesh Varma was quoted as saying by the TASS news agency on Saturday.In October 2018, India had signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, notwithstanding warning from the Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions.Last year, India made the first tranche of payment of around USD 800 million to Russia for the missile systems.In February, Deputy Director of the Russia’s Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation (FSMTC), Vladimir Drozhzhov, said that Moscow will begin the delivery of the S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to India by the end of 2021 and there will be no delay in execution of the project.“We will fulfil our delivery commitments,” Drozhzhov had said, adding that the defence cooperation between the two countries is very robust.The ‘Triumf’ interceptor-based missile system can destroy incoming hostile aircraft, missiles and even drones at ranges of up to 400 km.The S-400 is known as Russia’s most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system.Russia plans to complete the delivery of the fifth regimental set in the first half of 2025.The US had imposed sanctions on Russia under the stringent Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). The law also provides for punitive action against countries purchasing defence hardware from Russia.

12-04-2020||New Delhi||Lawyers write to CJI for taking suo motu note of rise in child abuse cases during lockdown||A letter has been written to Chief Justice of India S A Bobde requesting him to take suo motu (on its own) cognizance of increase in number of child abuse cases during the ongoing nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus.The letter written by two lawyers, Sumeer Sodhi and Aarzoo Aneja, said that during the lockdown though overall rate of crime had gone down, incidents of abuse and violence faced by children have risen.“Under normal circumstances, it is not considered safe for abused children to stay at home as it might result in further suffering at the hands of their own family members.  However, during the lockdown the danger to these children is exacerbated, as they are unable to leave their homes. The isolation has further shattered support networks, making it even more difficult for the victims to seek help or escape,” the letter said.                 It said child abuse incidents have already risen in India due to the lockdown and will keep increasing if steps are not taken immediately to protect and support the victims of child abuse. “This Court is therefore requested to take cognizance of the issue of protecting rights of children and their safety in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The need of the hour is to issue guidelines to various authorities for protecting children from violence and abuse, which is inflicted upon them by their own family members/ relatives/care takers, taking measures to ensure that counselling is made available to them. The NGOs/ Organizations which work in the field of child welfare need to be mobilized at this time of child abuse pandemic. Hence the present letter petition,” it said. The lawyers, said that the basis of their letter are articles published in media in which it has been reported that hotlines are lighting up with cases of child abuse and the childline India Helpline has received more than 92,000 calls asking for protection of children from abuse and violence in the past few days during the lockdown period.“It was further stated that number of calls have increased by 50 per cent since March 24, 2020, i.e. the day of imposition of lockdown. It is further stated that confinement is fostering tension and strain created by security, health, and money issues. This sudden surge in the number of such incidents which are being reported and those which go unreported is not confined to India, as per various reports in international dailies,” the letter said. It said that the person committing the abuse is putting in danger the life of a child, and clearly violating the fundamental right of life and the right to live with dignity of that child, which is a facet of Article 21 of the Constitution of India as held by this court in plethora of cases.It said that the top court has recently held that since COVID-19 is intensifying in India, it is important that urgent measures are taken on priority basis to prevent the spread of virus to Child Care Institutions and has directed positive measures, which has to be taken by child welfare committees, Juvenile Justice Boards and Children Courts, Government amongst others.            The letter said that the top court has by its recent orders acknowledged that violence, including sexual violence may be exacerbated in context of anxiety and stress produced by lockdown and fear of the disease.“The need for further orders on the subject arise in view of the fact that the order dated April 3, is restricted to preventing spread of COVID-19 in Child Care Institutions and Foster Homes, whereas further orders are required to be passed to ensure that the children otherwise who are being subjected to domestic and sexual violence are protected from the wrath of the frustration that possibly comes with the lockdown,” it said         The letter further stated that no notification/guidelines/positive measures have been taken by the Government until now for protecting the children from abuse during this period of lockdown and there are children who need care and attention.It said that the COVID -19 pandemic situation is the greatest challenge of our times and as the pandemic is intensifying in India, there are chances that the lockdown would be extended.“If positive measures are not taken urgently for  protecting rights of the children, their fundamental right to live with dignity and their right to safety would be violated as the children would be exposed to danger.          “Though there is also an increase in the number of cases being reported of domestic violence, but since there is a possibility of a grown up woman fighting for her rights as opposed to a child who possibly does not even know what rights he/she has, the present letter is being restricted for welfare of children,” the letter said.

12-04-2020||Not just lockdown||Not just lockdown, intense testing, contact tracing equally crucial to fight COVID-19: Kerala FM||New Delhi, April 12Ramping up efforts to “stamp out” coronavirus cases in the state, Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Isaac has said that not only lockdown but intense testing of people and tracing of their contacts are also equally important in the fight against the outbreak.Kerala, which was the first state in the country to report a coronavirus infection in late January, has also prepared a time table for coming out of the lockdown and there would be district-specific strategies to tackle the situation while the number of cases are on the decline.In efforts to curb spreading of coronavirus infections, the country is under a 21-day lockdown till April 14 and many states have sought an extension amid rising number of cases. Kerala has proposed extending the lockdown and gradual phasing out after proper assessment.“Lockdown should go on till we stamp out entire infections. Now, it is not enough to have lockdown. Equally important is that we should have intense testing, tracing and isolating (of people with coronavirus infections),” he told PTI in a telephonic interview.The government is closely monitoring the situation and there would be region-specific or district-specific strategies in place to tackle the outbreak, he said.Against the backdrop of the lockdown that has also disrupted economic activities, Isaac said an exit strategy is being prepared and restrictions are being relaxed in certain segments, including agriculture.“The number of patients is coming down (in the state). We hope that in the coming days, the decline will be much faster,” he said during the interview late Friday.On Saturday, the Kerala government said there were a total of 373 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections and 228 patients were under treatment in various hospitals in the state.Keeping the trend in the last few days, the number of people under observation has come down to 1,23,490. So far, 14,613 samples from people with symptoms were sent for testing and the results of 12,818 samples have come negative, the government said in a statement on Saturday.Indicating that there would be a calibrated exit from the lockdown, Isaac said the withdrawal would depend on three main factors, including the count of cases and the percentage of people who are under observation.While emphasising that people must also be fed during the lockdown period, Isaac also said a time table is being prepared by the state to come out of the lockdown.Even as strict measures are being implemented to deal with the current situation, the state is also preparing for a possible third wave of coronavirus cases.Three students, who had returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan, were tested positive. They were also the first such cases, to be reported in January-February period, and have recovered. Wuhan was the epicentre of coronavirus infections before it spread to other countries.Later, there was a second wave of infections in Kerala.According to the minister, the possibility of a third wave has also been considered for the exit strategy.“A lot of Malayalees are expected to come back from outside the state. We will welcome them... before that, we want to stamp out all Covid cases in Kerala. Flatten the curve completely so that when these people from outside, they will be quarantined, they will be tested and only then they will be able to integrate with the rest of the community,” he said.The Kerala government’s measures, including extensive testing and efforts to trace people who came in contact with coronavirus-infected persons, have helped in curbing spreading of infections.The state’s public healthcare system has also been appreciated in various quarters.“People are health conscious. There is a demand for quality healthcare services and the response to this demand has been strengthening of the public healthcare system. We have a robust public healthcare system,” the minister emphasised.On April 9, Isaac tweeted about low level of coronavirus spreading in the state.“International norm for Covid spread is 2.6 per 1 Covid patient.

12-04-2020||New Delhi||MP only state in the world without a health or home minister: Kamal Nath||Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and Congress leader Kamal Nath on Sunday blamed the BJP for the COVID-19 crisis in the state saying MP was the only state in the world without ministers.Addressing a video conference through AICC, Nath said, “Madhya Pradesh is the only state in the world which has no council of ministers in place. MP doesn’t have a health minister or a home minister...45 of the state health department officials are infected with COVID19 including principal secretary health. How will they protect others when they are themselves positive?”Nath said the people of MP are constrained to seek admission in private hospitals over government ones. He blamed the BJP government at the centre for playing politics and continuing to run the Parliament only to install their government in MP by toppling the Congress Government.“It is obvious they continued to run Parliament only to ensure the MP assembly functioned so that they could topple our government and install their own,” former CM said.Asked if he held the BJP responsible for the political transformation in MP, Nath said it was "obvious".The Congress veteran noted that the country was facing a serious economic crisis due to COVID and it was for the Centre to ensure that the economic package it announced focused on key sectors to enable resumption of financial activities.Nath also said MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan had called him up for suggestions and the two decided to remain engaged on COVID situation.“This is no time for playing politics or finger-pointing,” Nath said.MP has 532 COVID cases and none has so far been cured or discharged.The state has seen 36 deaths.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-only-state-in-the-world-without-a-health-or-home-minister-kamal-nath-70181

It is requested that necessary action in this regard may be taken urgently under-report to this ministry," the letter stated.More than 30,000 doctors, including those from Armed Forces Medical Services, have volunteered to help the government in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, a senior government official said on Friday.The government on March 25 had appealed to retired government, Armed Forces Medical Services, public sector undertaking or private doctors to come forward and join the efforts to fight the pandemic.The death toll due to the novel coronavirus rose to 242 and the number of cases climbed to 7,529 in the country on Saturday, according to the health ministry.However, a PTI tally of figures reported by various states at 9 PM Saturday showed at least 8,320 cases and 287 deaths.There has been a lag in the Union Health Ministry figures, compared to the number of cases announced by different states, which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states.

They are recovering and their condition is stable now," Dr Gautam Bhansali, consulting physician at Bombay Hospital, said.Without specifying the number of infected employees, the company said in a statement that most of them were "asymptomatic showing absolutely no signs of illness" and that the employees were tested proactively."However, staff testing positive and symptomatic were duly hospitalized and others who were in contact with them have immediately been put in quarantine," the company statement said.The iconic Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel of the company in south Mumbai does not have any guests at present and only minimal staff are present to ensure the upkeep of the property, it said.When contacted, a senior official of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation could not give any information as to how the civic body was treating the IHC properties where staff tested positive. In some cases, the BMC declares the building where patients are found and areas around it as "containment zones".The civic body official only said that three people had tested positive last week. Dr Bhansali said two of the patients were admitted on Saturday, while the rest had come earlier.A doctor working for the civic body said last week they were accommodated in Taj Palace Colaba and later shifted to Tak Lands End in Bandra.Asserting that all of its staffers found positive are from Taj Colaba, an IHC official said the property overlooking the famous Gateway of India monument has been completely sanitised and there is no one going in or out.

12-04-2020||Washington||Anti-Malaria drug from India, linked to coronavirus treatment, reaches US||A consignment of hydroxychloroquine from India has arrived in the US, days after New Delhi lifted a ban on the export of the anti-malarial drug, seen as a possible cure for COVID-19, to America and some other countries on humanitarian grounds.Earlier this week, India at the request of President Donald Trump cleared the export of 35.82 lakh tablets of hydroxychloroquine to the US along with nine metric tons of active pharmaceutical ingredient or API required in the manufacturing of the drug."Supporting our partners in the fight against COVID-19. Consignment of hydroxychloroquine from India arrived at Newark airport today (Saturday)," India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu tweeted.Supporting our partners in the fight against #Covid19. Consignment of hydroxichloroquine from India arrived at Newark airport today. pic.twitter.com/XZ6utQ6JHr  Trump, during a phone call last week, asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lift the hold on American order of the anti-malarial drug, of which India is the major producer. India, which manufactures 70 per cent of the world's supply of hydroxychloroquine, lifted the ban on April 7.Hydroxychloroquine has been identified by the US Food and Drug Administration as a possible treatment for the COVID-19 and it is being tested on more than 1,500 coronavirus patients in New York.Anticipating that it will work, given initial positive results, Trump has bought more than 29 million doses of hydroxychloroquine for the potential treatment of COVID-19 patients.The arrival of the consignment was welcomed by Americans. "US will never forget this great humanitarian gesture by India. Under President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the two largest democracies of the world have come together than ever in the past,” said New York-based Al Mason, a real estate consultant and a Trump supporter.“A wonderful gesture by India to its friends in need,” tweeted Dr Sampat Shivangi. Describing this as a “wonderful gesture”, Steve Filipovic, who works in the construction industry, thanked the Indian Ambassador.Meanwhile, according to a new French study of 1,061 hospitalised COVID-19 patients showed a 91.7 per cent cure (viral shedding) within 10 days of hydroxychloroquine treatment along with anti-biotic. It also reported a 96 per cent cure rate after 15 days.Early this week, the National Institute of Health reported that a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of adults hospitalised with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has begun, with the first participants now enrolled in Tennessee.Hydroxychloroquine is used to treat malaria and rheumatoid conditions such as arthritis. In various studies, the drug has demonstrated antiviral activity, an ability to modify the activity of the immune system, and has an established safety profile at appropriate doses, leading to the hypothesis that it may also be useful in the treatment of COVID-19, NIH said.The drug is not without risks as even short-term use can cause cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, dermatological reactions, and hypoglycemia, it added.“Many US hospitals are currently using hydroxychloroquine as first-line therapy for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 despite extremely limited clinical data supporting its effectiveness,” said Wesley Self, emergency medicine physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and PETAL Clinical Trials Network investigator leading the ORCHID trial.“Thus, data on hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 are urgently needed to inform clinical practice,” he added.According to NIH, participants will be randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily for two doses (day one), then 200 mg twice daily for the subsequent eight doses (days two to five) or a placebo twice daily for five days.COVID-19 cases were first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.As of Saturday, more than 16 lakh people globally tested positive and more than one lakh have died. The United States has emerged as the hotspot with 20,000 deaths and 5.3 lakh cases.

12-04-2020||Washington||Migrant workers returning home could spread coronavirus in sub-continent: World Bank||The World Bank on Sunday said migrant workers returning home could become vectors carrying the coronavirus to unaffected states and villages and that preliminary findings indicated in India many outmigration areas are likely to have COVID-19 cases.In its biannual regional report, the World Bank said South Asia is one of the highest population density areas in the world, particularly urban areas, and that preventing domestic coronavirus transmission is an enormous challenge in the region.“This makes contagion easier, especially among the most vulnerable people: slum dwellers and migrant workers,” it said.In India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, the time between the announcement of suspension of inland passenger transport and its enforcement was less than a day, which gave way to chaos as migrants scrambled to get back to their provinces, exacerbating the crowding and making enforcement of social distancing impossible.“The flow of migrant workers could easily become vectors carrying the coronavirus back to other states and villages,” said the World Bank in its “South Asia Economic Update: Impact of COVID-19” report released Sunday.One minor advantage of South Asia is that the population over 65 years of age is lower than in the US and China, which could also limit the death rates, the report stated.However, household sizes are large. As in other countries, the inadequate availability of medical equipment (such as sanitizers, masks, and ventilators), and a scarcity of mostly imported medical products led countries to stock domestic supplies.The Bank said that lockdown policies have affected hundreds of millions of migrants across the subcontinent many of whom are day labourers and no longer have work in urban centres, leading to mass migrations, often by foot, back to their rural homes.Migrants face a stark choice between potentially starving in urban centers without work or long and potentially fatal journeys over hundreds of miles to their home districts, it said.“Preliminary findings indicate that in India, high-outmigration areas are more likely to have COVID-19 cases,” the World Bank said as it urged the government to direct early resources to high-risk areas as defined by high-migration corridors, including medical equipment and staf“Use available big data and digital data to analyse patterns of reverse migration and movement around the country, to more precisely identify potential hot-spots,” it said and called for establishing social safety nets to help limit reverse migration “If not possible to prevent reverse migration to rural districts via urban-centered social protection programs, governments should consider immediate assistance to migrants to limit suffering and loss of life during the strenuous long-distance journeys, by providing information and food and water to journeying migrants,” the World Bank said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/migrant-workers-returning-home-could-spread-coronavirus-in-sub-continent-world-bank-70147

12-04-2020||---||Centre set to extend lockdown by 2 weeks||New Delhi, April 11Stage appears to be set for the extension of nationwide lockdown for at least two more weeks as states today made emphatic requests in that regard during the chief ministers’ interaction with PM Narendra Modi, keeping in view the spread of Covid-19 pandemic in the country.Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi Chief MinisterBack pm’s decision: KejriwalPM has taken correct decision to extend lockdown... If lifted, all gains would be lost. With Odisha and Punjab having already announced extension of the lockdown, many CMs, including Mamata Banerjee of West Bengal, also favoured continuation of the lockdown beyond April 14.An official announcement is expected soon. Officials privy to the discussions said the Centre was formulating a calibrated exit strategy in conformity with the norm of social distancing and coming up with a model to open up sectors to kick-start economy.On economic challenges, the PM said the crisis was an opportunity to become self-reliant. He suggested specific measures in agriculture and allied sectors, including modifying agriculture produce marketing company law to facilitate sale of produce at the farm gate. Emphasising that the coming three to four weeks would be critical in determining the impact of the steps taken so far, he said teamwork was the key to facing the challenge.Expressing distress over attacks on doctors and misbehaviour with students from the North-East and J& K, the Prime Minister said such cases should be dealt with firmly.The motto of the government from earlier “jaan hai to jahaan hai” is “jaan bhi, jahaan bhi”. Suggesting the CMs to popularise Aarogya Setu app, he said South Korea and Singapore achieved success through contact tracing, which this app could do through technology.This app could become an electronic pass in future to facilitate travel from one place to another. China has a QR colour code-based app permitting movement of people across different zones.It was the third interaction of the PM since March 22.Joint Secretary & above to attend workThe Centre has decided to gradually bring back to work officers in the rank of Joint Secretary & above from Monday, while drawing support staff as needed.

12-04-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus pandemic: Would’ve been 8.2 lakh cases sans shutdown||The government today claimed that the nationwide lockdown had helped the country limit the extent of disease transmission to significant levels as compared to the previously alarming projections. A statistical study by the Ministry of Health estimated that in the absence of a lockdown, the country would have clocked 8.2 lakh Covid-19 cases by April 15.Harsh Vardhan, Union Health MinisterPotent ‘social vaccines’Lockdown and social distancing are most effective ‘social vaccines’ to fight the pandemic.The actual disease burden as of today is 7,529 cases, 242 deaths and 652 cured.Though the country witnessed the highest single-day rise in cases (1,117) and mortality (40) since yesterday, the overall national Covid burden is still around 1 per cent of the government estimation in a “no-lockdown” situation.“Assuming 41 per cent cumulative growth rate, India, in a no-lockdown situation would have witnessed 8.2 lakh Covid-19 cases by April 15,” said Health Ministry spokesman Lav Agarwal after CMs of most states today urged PM Narendra Modi to extend the ongoing lockdown by at least two weeks.In the second projected scenario of India going in for mass containment efforts, but no lockdown, the government estimated to see 1.2 lakh Covid-19 cases by April 15.“In the pre-lockdown stage, we saw the highest cumulative growth rate of 28.9 per cent. At this growth rate, we would have seen 1.2 lakh cases by April 15 had we only gone in only for containment without national lockdown,” Lav Agarwal said.The rate of Covid infections in India had begun to rise dramatically in the pre-lockdown days with the PM deciding to announce a Janata Curfew on March 22 followed by a 21-day national lockdown from March 24.Post the lockdown, rate of infections largely remained stable between 11 and 17 per cent until last Sunday when a cluster in Delhi’s Nizamuddin suddenly spiked the disease burden nationally with contact tracing of the cluster’s primary patient’s still underway.India has so far built 586 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals across states with one lakh isolation bed strength and 11,500 ICU beds. “This capacity is being augmented,” said the government. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-pandemic-wouldve-been-8-2-lakh-cases-sans-shutdown-69894

12-04-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Parents travel 2,100 km by road  to Bengaluru for Colonel’s last rites||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 11An elderly couple in their 70s have undertaken an emergency 2,100-km road trip from New Delhi to Bengaluru to “see” their dead son one last time.The body of Colonel Navjot Singh Bal from the 2 Para Special Forces is at a morgue of a military hospital in Bengaluru, where he died of cancer on April 9.Colonel Bal’s parents — Lt Col KS Bal (retd) and Ramninder Kaur — set off from Gurugram on April 10 on the long road trip.“The cremation of Bal, 39, is held up,” a ‘Para-SF’ mate of Col Bal told The Tribune. The Colonel is survived by his wife and two sons — aged 8 and 4 years. Aarti, wife of the Colonel, awaits her in-laws for the last rites of her husband.With no commercial flights or trains available, the family was given the option of transporting the Colonel’s body on a military aircraft to Delhi. However, the family insisted on cremation at Bengaluru, Army officials confirmed.The option was explored if the couple could be flown to Bengaluru in a military plane. However, owing to confusion at several levels, including in the Ministry of Defence and the military establishment, the Bals could not be accommodated on a military flight from Palam (New Delhi) to Bengaluru on April 10.Sources said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, acting on a request from the office of Chief of Defence Staff, permitted the Bals to be accommodated on a C-17 transport plane of the IAF on April 10.Since the flight was requisitioned by the MHA, someone in the military establishment thought it was better to take a ‘sanction’ from the MHA. The MHA telephonically gave its go-ahead. The military establishment, however, insisted on a ‘written sanction’. The MHA told officials coordinating the flight that a request for such a sanction needn’t even come to it. There is no rule for the MHA to allow or deny permission for military planes or passengers on board such planes.Sources said the telephonic nod from the MHA should have been noted and orders passed accordingly, given the unprecedented situation in the country. The Bals were also willing to pay for the journey. In places such as Leh, civilians are often ferried to Chandigarh aboard military planes during winter when there are no flights.An official said a matter that should have ended at the table of the Joint Secretary (Air) in the MoD had turned into one of blame game. Retired veterans are blaming the ‘babus’ in the MoD and MHA, without realising the fault was at multiple levels, including within the military.Mates raise 22 lakhOn the night of April 9-10 when MoD officials were busy going through the rule book, Colonel Bal’s mates from Para-SF collected Rs22 lakh to ferry parents by helicopter from Delhi and Bengaluru airports. However, it couldn’t materialise as they embarked on a road trip||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parents-travel-2-100-km-by-road-to-bengaluru-for-colonels-last-rites-69838

Free ration is being distributed by political leaders and not through the institutional delivery system. This may have resulted in spread of Covid-19 infection,” the letter said.The MHA said such activities were in violation of the Central Government’s orders issued from time to time under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and were liable for penal action under the Act.“It is requested that strict action be taken in the matter and a report in this regard be furnished to this ministry urgently,” it said, while advising to take measures to prevent recurrence of such violations in future.Interestingly, the Home Ministry Deputy Secretary’s letter was circulated among journalists by BJP MP and Union Minister of State Babul Supriyo and journalist-turned-BJP politician Swapan Dasgupta. The BJP also presented a memorandum to the Governor accusing the state government of suppressing information regarding the Covid infected people in the state, pointing out that on April 10, the Centre’s figures showed 116 cases against the state government’s claim of 95 infected.Belying the state government’s claim that only five people have died, the BJP also released a list of 16 cremations in different parts of West Bengal.The observations||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-diluting-lockdown-mha-69837
