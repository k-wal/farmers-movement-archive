India remains committed to providing vaccines to vulnerable and low-income countries,” Sitharaman said.Observing that a faster than expected policy normalisation in Advanced Economies (AEs) and its implications for EMEs would need to be looked into more closely, she called for a coordination among the membership and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to play a key role in ensuring smooth transition of policy withdrawals.Sitharaman said that to ensure that post-pandemic policy normalisation does not cause economic disruption, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies, it is necessary that the IMF remains adequately resourced and be at the core of the global financial safety net.“Therefore, we reiterate that dependence of the Fund on borrowed resources can at best be a temporary short-term arrangement,” she said, adding that permanent resources should be augmented with quota revision and the long pending issues of out-of-lineness and underrepresentation of EMEs should be addressed.“We expect discussion on the 16th General Review of Quotas to progress swiftly and get completed within the agreed time frame,” she said.Briefing the IMF on India’s COVID 19 responses, Sitharaman said that unlike during the first wave, and though the Delta variant caused a sharp surge in infections during the second wave, the economy adapted to the work environment under COVID-19 with enhanced use of digitalisation.The containment measures were also more focused and localised during the second wave. To protect economic activity, the package of fiscal, monetary and financial measures provided support to businesses and households at an unprecedented scale.More importantly, India, unlike most economies, continued its agenda of structural reforms during the pandemic, she said.“Wide-ranging structural reforms, including agriculture and labour reforms, and monetisation of assets, are expected to contribute towards a structural acceleration of economic growth,” she said.As the pandemic impacts the vulnerable section of society relatively more, India significantly expanded income support through food subsidy and cash transfers, especially for those at the bottom of the income pyramid.Further, the One Nation, One Ration Card policy ensured that the bottom two-thirds of the population eligible for food subsidy could access it from anywhere in India rather than be restricted to the state of their registration, she said.“This, in particular, has benefitted the migrant workers. Further, the world’s largest vaccination drive is underway in India.“With steady rise in average daily vaccination doses from 42.0 lakh in July to 56.6 lakh in August, by September more than 73 per cent of the adult population have received at least one dose, while more than 26 per cent have received both doses. With this, the target to fully vaccinate all our adult population by the end-December 2021 seems achievable,” Sitharaman added.

He has been part of the crime world since the age of 17. He has multiple FIRs against him and is presently lodged in Rohini jail (in connection with the Delhi Police case),” the ED had said.Despite being in the jail, it said, Chandrashekhar “did not stop conning” people.“He (using a cellphone procured illegally in prison) with the help of technology, made spoofed calls to dupe people as the numbers displayed on the called party’s phone number belonged to senior government officers.“While speaking (from prison) to these persons, he claimed to be a government officer offering to help people for a price,” the ED had claimed. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-issues-fresh-summons-to-actor-jacqueline-fernandez-after-she-skips-summons-325034

15-10-2021||Vibha Sharma||Veer Savarkar’s patriotism and valour cannot be questioned: Amit Shah||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 15Amid the ongoing political war over Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s comments on Hindu Mahasabha leader Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday said Veer Savarkar’s contributions to India’s freedom struggle will be remembered forever and those criticising him should have “some shame”.Savarkar’s patriotism and valour cannot be questioned, Shah said, hitting back at those “doubting his commitment to India and its freedom struggle”. Savarkar turned the Cellular Jail into a ‘mahatirth’ (shrine) and gave a message to the world that they could torture him as they want but they cannot stop or block his rights, Shah said, addressing a gathering in Port Blair as part of 75 years of India’s Independence, which the government is celebrating as “Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav”.“How can you doubt the life, the credentials of a man made to sweat like a ‘kolhu ka bail’ to extract oil at this prison. Have some shame,” the minister said, adding that the title ‘Veer’ was given to him not by any government but by the people of the country for his courage. “The title given to him by people of India cannot be snatched away,” he said, paying tributes to freedom fighters lodged in the Cellular Jail, or ‘Kaala Paani’ as it was called, where hundreds were incarcerated during India’s freedom struggle.Shah visited the cell where Savarkar was imprisoned and paid floral tributes to the Hindutva ideologue.He also remembered Sachindranath Sanyal, founder of the Hindustan Republican Association. “Today, I visited the cell of Sanyal and garlanded his portrait. It was an emotional moment for a person like me. Perhaps he was the only one among all these freedom fighters who was sent twice to 'kala paani’,” he said.His comments came against the row generated by Rajnath Singh’s remark that Savarkar had filed mercy petitions before the British at the advice of Mahatma Gandhi. Opposition leaders, and some historians as well, attacked him, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and the BJP, accusing them of “trying to rewrite history”.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi shared on Twitter a letter by Gandhi on January 25, 1920, to Savarkar’s brother regarding a case and accused Singh of giving a “twist” to that. Owaisi also claimed that the BJP will soon declare Savarkar as ‘father of the nation’Shah said Savarkar had everything that he needed for a good life, but he chose the tough path, which indicated his unwavering commitment to the motherland. “There cannot be a greater pilgrimage than this cellular jail. This place is a ‘mahatirth’ where Savarkar experienced inhuman torture for 10 years but did not lose his courage, his bravery,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/veer-savarkars%C2%A0patriotism-and-valour-cannot-be-questioned%C2%A0amit-shah-325016
15-10-2021||New Delhi||UK Carrier Strike Group led by HMS Queen Elizabeth enters Bay of Bengal||The UK’s Carrier Strike Group led by its largest warship HMS Queen Elizabeth sailed into the Bay of Bengal on Friday for the second such voyage in the last three months, in a powerful demonstration of the growing strategic partnership between the two countries.The British High Commission in India said the Carrier Strike Group (CSG) will take part in the “most demanding exercise” ever between the UK and India, incorporating elements from all three military services.HMS Queen Elizabeth and its strike task group had carried out a mega wargame with a number of Indian warships and submarines in the Bay of Bengal in July that featured a range of complex drills.“The deployment is a powerful demonstration of the UK’s commitment to deepening its diplomatic, economic and security-based ties in the Indo-Pacific region. India is essential in ensuring a free, open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific,” the High Commission said in a statement.A carrier battle group or carrier strike group is a mega naval fleet comprising an aircraft carrier, accompanied by a large number of destroyers, frigates and other ships.British High Commissioner to India Alex Ellis said India is an “essential” partner for the UK in the Indo-Pacific region and that the Carrier Strike Group’s visit demonstrates the deepening of the bilateral defence and security partnership.The envoy also referred to the resolve by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to work towards shared security and prosperity.“This visit will boost the cooperation of our armed forces and show the living bridge connecting our people,” he said.First Sea Lord Admiral Tony Radakin said the CSG’s engagement with India showcases the deepening comprehensive strategic partnership.“Both the Indian and the Royal Navy are blue-water, multi-carrier navies, which places us in a very exclusive club,” he said.“Our growing interactions are a testimony to the shared commitment to the rules-based international system, a belief in the values of open trade, and in the importance of the freedom of the high seas - a right conveyed on all nations,” he added.HNLMS Evertsen, a Provinciën-class frigate of the Royal Netherlands Navy, is also visiting Mumbai along with the British CSG.Ambassador of the Netherlands to India Marten van den Berg said the Indian Ocean is a gateway for Europe into the Indo-Pacific and his country definitely recognises India’s crucial role in the region.“The visit to the port of Mumbai by HNLMS Evertsen is a confirmation of our long-standing strong relationship and a step towards enhancement of the Netherlands and India defence relations,” the envoy said.

This will be in addition to the backbone support being provided to India’s ambitious India’s National Infrastructure and Investment Fund (NIIF).The eighth meeting of the Economic and Financial Partnership meeting co-chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and US Treasury Secretary Janet Allen resolved to work together to prepare more Indian cities to issue municipal bonds for critical urban infrastructure improvements.“`We are continuing our successful collaboration on attracting more private sector capital to finance India’s infrastructure needs, which will support growth in both countries.  The US continues to provide technical support to NIIF including the scaling of debt and equity platforms while catalysing private institutional investment in Indian infrastructure,’’ said a joint statement issued after the meeting.US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das also attended the meeting which touched on banking and insurance sector reform, and capital markets development. The statement said both sides continued to strengthen cooperation in tackling money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism through increased information sharing and coordination.  Both sides also agreed on the importance of fighting financial crimes and on the effective implementation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards to protect financial systems from abuse.Sitharaman also attended the Plenary Meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) centered on “vaccinate, calibrate and accelerate”. Sitharaman pointed out the ``stark differences’’ in vaccination coverage of low-income countries and advanced countries and felt it was critical to address vaccine inequity.She also flagged the principle of common, but differentiated, responsibilities and capabilities to combat climate change.

15-10-2021||New Delhi||Dip in India’s rank in Global Hunger Index ‘shocking’, methodology used is ‘unscientific’: Govt||The Centre on Friday said it was shocking that India’s rank was lowered on the Global Hunger Index and it termed the methodology used for rankings “unscientific”.India slipped to 101st position in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2021 of 116 countries, from its 2020 position of 94th. It is now behind its neighbours Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.The GHI report, prepared jointly by Irish aid agency Concern Worldwide and German organisation Welt Hungerhilfe, termed the level of hunger in the country “alarming”.Reacting sharply to the Global Hunger Report 2021, the Women and Child Development Ministry said it is “shocking” to find that it has lowered the rank of India on the basis of FAO estimate on proportion of undernourished population which is found to be “devoid of ground reality and facts, and suffers from serious methodological issues”.“The publishing agencies of the Global Hunger Report, Concern Worldwide and Welt Hungerhilfe, have not done their due diligence before releasing the report,” the ministry said in a statement.The methodology used by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is “unscientific”, the ministry claimed.“They have based their assessment on the results of a ‘four question’ opinion poll which was conducted telephonically by Gallup. The scientific measurement of undernourishment would require measurement of weight and height, whereas the methodology involved here is based on Gallup poll based on pure telephonic estimate of the population,” it said.The ministry said the report “completely disregards” the government’s massive effort to ensure food security of the entire population during the Covid period, verifiable data on which are available.“The opinion poll does not have a single question on whether the respondent received any food support from the government or other sources. The representativeness of even this opinion poll is doubtful for India and other countries,” it said.The ministry said it is noted with surprise in the FAO report ‘The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2021’ that other four countries of this region, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, have not been affected at all by COVID-19 pandemic induced loss of job/business and reduction in income levels.It said that, instead, the nations have been able to improve their position on the indicator ‘proportion of undernourished population’ by 4.3 per cent, 3.3 per cent, 1.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent points, respectively, during the period 2018-20 over 2017-19.The Global Hunger Report 2021 and FAO report have “completely ignored” the facts available in public domain, the WCD Ministry added.The ministry also listed efforts taken by it like the implementation of additional nationwide schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojna (PMGKAY) and the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Scheme (ANBS).It said that during 2020, 3.22 crore (32.2 million) metric tons of food grains, and during  2021, about 3.28 crore (32.8 million) metric tons of food grains, have been allocated free of cost under the PMGKAY scheme to approximately 80 crore (800 million) beneficiaries.The ministry said that to prevent disruption in the employment of wage-earners getting below Rs 15,000 per month in organised sector businesses having less than 100 workers, the government deposited 24 per cent of their monthly wages into their PF accounts for three months from April to June, 2020.“MNREGA wages were increased by Rs 20 with effect from April 1, 2020 to provide an additional Rs 2,000 benefit annually to a worker to benefit approximately 13.62 crore (136.2 million) families,” it said.“As per this report, India’s position on the first indicator, child mortality, has improved in 2021 compared with 2020. Position on two indicators, i.e., child wasting and child stunting, has remained unchanged in 2021 compared with 2020,” the ministry said.In 2020, India was ranked 94th out of 107 countries. Now with 116 countries in the fray, it has dropped to 101st rank.India’s GHI score has also decelerated, from 38.8 in 2000 to the range of 28.8-27.5 between 2012 and 2021.The GHI score is calculated on four indicators, undernourishment, child wasting (share of children under age of five who are wasted i.e who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition), child stunting (children under age of five who have low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition) and child mortality (mortality rate of children under age of five).

It is rich in vitamins and protein,” he said.Cattle can consume the chocolate as it is and it can also be served with other feeds, he added.“Each piece of chocolate is around 500 gm and is prepared with ingredients traditionally used in cattle feed such as mustard cake, rice polish, molasses, starch, lime powder and common salt,” Tiwari said, adding that each piece would cost Rs 25.The university had designed wooden moulds for production of these chocolates and 500 pieces had been manufactured so far, he said.The university had written to the state government and once it got the go-ahead, the product would enter the market, Tiwari said.

Amid the Opposition’s criticism that the BJP-led Centre had “failed to provide security to the people of Jammu and Kashmir,” Shah said earlier (before 2014 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi took over) whenever such incidents happened, there used to be a “polite request from the Delhi Durbar”.“All this changed after there was an attack and our jawans were killed. For the first time (in 2016), India conducted a surgical strike and told the world that India would not tolerate such attacks… that no one could disrupt India’s borders,” Shah said, terming the surgical strike under PM Modi and late Manohar Parrikar, the then Defence Minister, an “important message to the world”.“For many years, there were transgressions at our borders, terrorists used to enter and carry out terrorist activities.

Rajnath Singh cited the example of Rani Laxmi Bai for women having taken up arms to protect their country and rights of the people.Refers to ’71 warIndia’s former PM Indira Gandhi not only led the country for a number of years, but she also did so during times of war. —Rajnath Singh, Defence ministerUnderlining that the concept of security, he said changing character of war was bringing threats from borders to within society. “Terrorism is just the most obvious and diabolical manifestation of this reality. It has been employed as a weapon of choice by non-state actors and irresponsible states alike for the furtherance of their political objectives. SCO as an organisation has unequivocally rejected terrorism in all its manifestations and forms,” he said, adding, “this fight cannot be won by half the population… Women too will remain equal contributors in this fight, both within the armed forces and beyond them.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajnath-singh-hails-indira-gandhi-324626
15-10-2021||New Delhi||Global Hunger Index: India slips to 101st rank; behind Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal||India has slipped to 101st position in the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2021 of 116 countries, from its 2020 position of 94th and is behind its neighbours Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.Eighteen countries, including China, Brazil and Kuwait, shared the top rank with GHI score of less than five, the website of the Global Hunger Index that tracks hunger and malnutrition said on Thursday.The report, prepared jointly by Irish aid agency Concern Worldwide and German organisation Welt Hunger Hilfe, termed the level of hunger in India “alarming”.In 2020, India was ranked 94th out of 107 countries. Now with 116 countries in the fray, it has dropped to 101st rank.India’s GHI score has also decelerated—from 38.8 in 2000 to the range of 28.8 - 27.5 between 2012 and 2021.The GHI score is calculated on four indicators—undernourishment; child wasting (the share of children under the age of five who are wasted i.e. who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition); child stunting (children under the age of five who have low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition) and child mortality (the mortality rate of children under the age of five).The share of wasting among children in India rose from 17.1 per cent between 1998-2002 to 17.3 per cent between 2016-2020, according to the report.“People have been severely hit by Covid-19 and by pandemic related restrictions in India, the country with highest child wasting rate worldwide,” the report said.Neighbouring countries like Nepal (76), Bangladesh (76), Myanmar (71) and Pakistan (92) are also in the ‘alarming’ hunger category, but have fared better at feeding its citizens than India, according to the report.However, India has shown improvement in other indicators such as the under-5 mortality rate, prevalence of stunting among children and prevalence of undernourishment owing to inadequate food, the report said.According to the report, the fight against hunger is dangerously off track. Based on the current GHI projections, the world as a whole—and 47 countries in particular—will fail to achieve a low level of hunger by 2030.Food security is under assault on multiple fronts, it said, adding that worsening conflict, weather extremes associated with global climate change, and the economic and health challenges associated with the Covid-19 pandemic are all driving hunger.“Inequality—between regions, countries, districts, and communities—is pervasive and, (if) left unchecked, will keep the world from achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) mandate to “leave no one behind,” the report said.Further, the report noted that it is difficult to be optimistic in 2021 because the forces now driving hunger are overpowering good intentions and lofty goals.Among the most powerful and toxic of these forces are conflict, climate change, and Covid-19—three Cs that threaten to wipe out any progress that has been made against hunger in recent years, it added.

15-10-2021||New Delhi||India resumes Covid-19 vaccine export||Coronavirus vaccines have been sent to Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Iran according to the government’s decision to resume their supplies, the Ministry of External Affairs said on Thursday.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the government has decided to send the supplies to the neighbourhood initially.India, the world’s largest producer of vaccines overall, suspended exports of Covid-19 vaccines in April to focus on inoculating its own population following a sudden spike in infections.Last month, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya announced that India will resume the supplies abroad.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi said recently at the UN General Assembly that India will resume supply of coronavirus vaccines. We have decided to start with the neighbourhood,” Bagchi said.“As far as I know, vaccines have already gone to Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Iran. We are constantly monitoring and reviewing the situation,” he said.Bagchi said the decision on further supplies will be based on India’s production and demand.“We will decide on further supplies based on our production and demand,” he said.

This is the land of Mahatma Gandhi and Buddha. The investigation is at preliminary stage, this is not the stage for grant of bail,” he added.Senior Advocate Amit Desai, representing Aryan Khan, said the NCB was pointing to international trafficking racket, but if the consumer states from where he procured drugs, then “the chain is complete”.The NCB itself had alleged that Aryan disclosed the name of Achit Kumar, another arrested accused, he said. The agency can continue the probe, but the allegation of links to international racket against Aryan is “inherently absurd and false”, he said.“I don’t think there can be a debate that the entire world is fighting the drug menace. We got our freedom and we must protect it and save the younger generation from the drug menace,” the lawyer said.On Aryan’s WhatsApp chats, Desai said today’s youth have different ways of expressing themselves which might be a “torture” for the older generation.The language could seem like something different than what ought to be (expected) in a court of law and might lead to suspicion, advocate Desai said.“These are private moments which are being investigated. You can go ahead and investigate...But it has nothing to do with illicit behaviour, illicit drug trafficking,” he added.Aryan Khan had lived abroad for some time, and lot of things are “legitimate” in other countries, the lawyer added.Earlier, Aryan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha, who were among those arrested by the NCB on October 3, had been denied bail by a magistrate’s court which said it cannot hear the pleas in a case triable by a special NDPS court.While Aryan and Merchant are lodged at Arthur Road jail, Dhamecha is at Byculla women’s prison in the city.Based on a tip-off that a rave party was scheduled on the ship off the Mumbai coast, an NCB team, led by its zonal director Sameer Wankhede, raided the Goa-bound Cordelia cruise on October 2  evening and allegedly seized drugs. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aryan-is-regular-consumer-of-drugs-says-ncb-court-to-pass-order-on-bail-on-october-20-324532

Rani Laxmi Bai is amongst the most revered and respected amongst them," he said.“India’s former prime minister Indira Gandhi not only led the country for a number of years, she also did so during the times of war. And more recently, Pratibha Patil was the President of India and the supreme commander of the Indian armed forces,” the defence minister added.Under Indira Gandhi's prime ministership, India won the 1971 war against Pakistan that resulted in the birth of Bangladesh.Singh said the tradition of women as both caregivers and protectors had continued over the centuries and remained deeply embedded in the customs and traditions of the region.

He was recently dropped from the BJP national executive in what was seen as an indication of the party leadership's unhappiness with the Pilibhit MP.
