They did not even try to contact the college management and when they were stopped from entering the hostel premises, they began raising slogans against the college,” Gupta said. “The college has suspended the three students. But they still raised objectionable slogans to defame the college,” he said.In protest to the incidents inside the college, its management said it has decided to indefinitely shut all its educational institutions and demanded action against the groups responsible. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-fir-against-3-kashmiri-students-for-celebrating-pak-crickets-victory-against-india-330457

27-10-2021||Satya Prakash||Right to privacy is sacrosanct: SC on Pegasus row||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 27The Supreme Court on Wednesday said right to privacy was sacrosanct even as it clarified that such a right can’t be said to be an absolute as the Constitution envisaged certain limitations on it.“Members of a civilised democratic society have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Privacy is not the singular concern of journalists or social activists. Every citizen of India ought to be protected against violations of privacy,” a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said while ordering an independent probe into Pegasus snooping allegations.“It’s this expectation which enables us to exercise our choices, liberties, and freedom,” it said, adding “The right to privacy is directly infringed when there is surveillance or spying done on an individual, either by the State or by any external agency.”Referring to K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017) case – in which right to privacy was declared a fundamental right – the top court said the verdict has recognised that “the right to privacy is as sacrosanct as human existence and is inalienable to human dignity and autonomy”.However, the Bench clarified that, “Although declared to be inalienable, the right to privacy of course cannot be said to be an absolute, as the Indian Constitution does not provide for such a right without reasonable restrictions. As with all the other fundamental rights, this Court therefore must recognize that certain limitations exist when it comes to the right to privacy as well. However, any restrictions imposed must necessarily pass constitutional scrutiny.”It said any violations of privacy, if done by the State, must be justified on constitutional grounds. “This Court is cognisant of the State’s interest to ensure that life and liberty is preserved and must balance the same,” it added.“For instance, in today’s world, information gathered by intelligence agencies through surveillance is essential for the fight against violence and terror. To access this information, a need may arise to interfere with the right to privacy of an individual, provided it is carried out only when it is absolutely necessary for protecting national security/interest and is proportional,” it said.The top court emphasised that, “The considerations for usage of such alleged technology, ought to be evidence based. In a democratic country governed by the rule of law, indiscriminate spying on individuals cannot be allowed except with sufficient statutory safeguards, by following the procedure established by law under the Constitution.”It said, “We live in the era of information revolution, where the entire lives of individuals are stored in the cloud or in a digital dossier. We must recognize that while technology is a useful tool for improving the lives of the people, at the same time, it can also be used to breach that sacred private space of an individual.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/right-to-privacy-is-sacrosanct-sc-on-pegasus-row-330447

Similarly, in Uttar Pradesh it will be ‘Khadeda Hobe’ (drive out) and the BJP government will be removed by the people of the state,” Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) president Om Prakash Rajbhar said here.He was addressing a ‘Vanchit, Pichhda, Dalit and Minority Bhagidari Mahapanchyat’, during which Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav announced the alliance between the two parties for the assembly polls.“When BJP leaders come to your village, you should ask them about price rise and then ask them to leave,” Rajbhar said.Yadav said Rajbhar has rightly said that in Uttar Pradesh ‘Khadeda Hobe’.When red and yellow colours of the SP and the SBSP unite, everyone knows who is becoming ‘laal-pila’ (angry) in Delhi and Lucknow, the SP chief said in a apparent reference to the BJP governments at the Centre and in the state.“Rajbhar will close the door through which the BJP came to power (in Uttar Pradesh) and SP workers will lock it,” he said.“There was speculation before the alliance about which party will win how many seats. But after the alliance, even big agencies are saying no one can stop us,” Yadav said.The Asaduddin Owaisi-led All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and Chandra Shekhar Azad’s Azad Samaj Party, which are part of the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, a grouping of smaller parties, were not seen in the mahapanchayat, indicating that the morcha has disintegrated after the SP and the SBSP joined hands.AIMIM national spokesperson Syed Asim Waqar told PTI: “We were not invited for the rally”.On whether his party will remain with the morcha, he said that “the decision in this regard will be taken by Owaisi ji”.Owaisi in a rally on Wednesday in Muzaffarnagar said the Muzaffarnagar riots were the worst after the Partition and the then ruling SP failed to provided justice to the victims.The Hyderabad Member of Parliament also accused the Akhilesh Yadav-led SP of considering Muslims as only vote bank. With four MLAs in the Uttar Pradesh assembly, the SBSP claims that 18-22 per cent Rajbhar community voters in eastern Uttar Pradesh are with it and it has influence in more than 150 of the 403 assembly seats in the state.Addressing the gathering, the SP chief called upon Dalits, and backward and deprived sections of society to get rid of the BJP in the upcoming polls and said if they miss this time, they will be pushed back by “five years” again.“When the SP and the SBSP are together, people might even give us 400 seats. When ‘purvanchal’ (eastern Uttar Pradesh) rises, it changes history. I am sure that in the coming elections, the BJP will be wiped out,” Yadav said.“When followers of Maharaja Suheldev and Ram Manohar Lohia come together, no force can compete with us,” he said.The former chief minister alleged that the BJP government did nothing but “loot the people”.“Today the condition is that both BJP leaders sitting in Delhi and Lucknow are lying. People who were shown a dream of travelling in an airplane in ‘chappals’, are today not able to ride their motorcycles due to rise in petrol price,” he said.He alleged that the BJP is cheating in the name of Kisan Samman Nidhi.“Farmers are getting Rs 500 in the name of this fund but they are being looted in the name of diesel, fertilisers and other things. Farmers have been protesting for the last 11 months against the new farm laws and during their protest over 600 farmers have died. But the BJP is not bothered about them,” he said.“When farmers demand justice and protest, they are being crushed under cars. The son of a Union minister is involved in the incident, and the minister has not resigned or being sacked. How can one expect justice in such a situation,” Yadav said, referring to the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.Rajbhar said that he has brought the future CM before the people and promised that if voted to power, caste census will be conducted in the state.Free treatment will be made available to the poor by enacting a law and work hours of police personnel will be reduced from 16-18 hours to eight hours, and they will also get a weekly off, he promised.“Old pension of state employees will be restored and domestic electricity bill for five year would be waived,” the SBSP leader said.On his resignation from post of minister, he said he resigned due to non-fulfilment of demand for implementation of recommendations of the Social Justice Committee.Rajbhar claimed that he told the prime minister and the UP chief minister that he had not come to serve them, but work to get justice to society.The BJP had forged a poll alliance with the SBSP, which won four seats in the 2017 Uttar Pradesh assembly elections.Rajbhar was then made a minister in the state government but he resigned ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sp-sbsp-join-hands-give-slogan-khadeda-hobe-on-lines-of-mamatas-khela-hobe-battle-cry-330446
27-10-2021||United Nations||Let COP26 be COP of actions in finance, technology support, not just promises & pledges: India at UN||As nations head into the crucial climate summit in Glasgow, India has said that the conference should not be just “promises and pledges” and the world needs rapid and deep emission cuts in this decade rather than distant targets.“Science has time and again clearly stated the urgency of accelerated climate action. Recent incidents of extreme weather events across the world corroborate what science is telling us,” Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav said.Addressing the high-level meeting ‘Delivering Climate Action—for People, Planet & Prosperity’ convened by President of the 76th session of the UN General Assembly Abdulla Shahid on Tuesday, Yadav said the world needs rapid, sustained, and deep emission cuts in this decade rather than distant targets. “However, the current discourse on climate ambition seems to be shifting the goalposts.”The high-level summit was convened just days before world leaders gather for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 26th Climate change conference in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12. “The trust and confidence of the world in the UN processes and forums must be safeguarded by all. Let COP26 be a COP of actions in finance and technology support and not just promises and pledges,” Yadav said.He asserted that as a global community, there is a need to ensure that everyone has the right to sustainable development and growth. “Combating climate change is a shared global challenge. The global climate action must be guided by the principles and values of climate justice, equity, and common but differentiated responsibilities in the light of national circumstances, as enshrined in the UN Framework Convention and its Paris Agreement,” he said.Emphasising that “it is already late”, Yadav stressed that it is time for all to take accelerated action on climate change. “Those who are historically responsible for climate change and have benefited in the past through a carbon intensive development must step up their action and take lead in providing timely and adequate finance and technology to support developing countries to accelerate their actions,” he said.Yadav told global leaders at the event that at a time when the developed world is exhibiting shortfall in actions with just 14.8 per cent emission reduction against the target of 18 per cent reduction in the pre-2020 period, India is overachieving its voluntary target of emission reduction. “We have reduced our emission intensity of GDP by 24% between 2005 and 2016, thereby achieving our pre-2020 voluntary target. Our 2030 targets under the Paris Agreement are considered ambitious and compatible with the Paris Agreement goals. We are on the path to achieving those targets,” he said.India has also set out an ambitious target of 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030. Currently, India has 389 GW total installed capacity and has already achieved 155 GW of non-fossil fuel installed capacity as of now. “We are accelerating action and we are confident to achieve this ambitious target by 2030,” he said, adding that India is also taking ambitious actions in energy efficiency measures, biofuels, sustainable transport, e-vehicles, enhancing green cover, sustainable agriculture.India has also taken an ambitious initiative of National Hydrogen Mission for the generation and export of green hydrogen.Yadav further said that the current stock of greenhouse gases is a result of the economic growth in the industrialised countries in the past which demanded increasing amounts of energy in the form of fossil fuels and they became today’s prosperous countries with capital stock and infrastructure. “In contrast, the adverse impacts of climate change falls disproportionately on developing countries who contributed little to the stock of greenhouse gases,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/let-cop26-be-cop-of-actions-in-finance-technology-support-not-just-promises-pledges-india-at-un-330441
27-10-2021||Vibha Sharma||Pegasus verdict: BJP welcomes SC order, calls it as per government affidavit||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 27The BJP on Wednesday welcomed the Supreme Court decision to set up an independent expert committee led by former top court judge RV Raveendran to look into allegations of snooping on journalists, activists, politicians, etc, using the Israeli Pegasus spyware and termed it “according to the affidavit submitted by the government in the court”.The party also slammed Rahul Gandhi for doing ‘brham ki rajniti’ (illusionary politics) and spreading falsehoods for his observation that Pegasus was a “weapon used by the government to crush Indian democracy”.“The government in its affidavit had categorically stated to the Supreme Court that we are also of the opinion that in order to counter the false narrative of certain vested interest groups it will be fair that if we establish a committee of experts to look into the entire issue and this is exactly what has happened. We welcome the order,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said.On the observation that the government actually wanted an experts committee of its own which was not allowed, Patra said: “It doesn’t matter experts are experts.”Notably, Gandhi also claimed that “Pegasus spyware was ordered either by Prime Minister or the Home Minister”.“If the PM has done this, we would like to know why the PM is doing an illegal act,” Gandhi questioned, stating that using Pegasus is “illegal” and that the Prime Minister “is not above the law”.Slamming Gandhi, Patra said it is obvious that the Congress leader is not interested in politics and just wanted to do “‘bhram ki rajniti’, spread falsehoods and create enmity in the country”.“Rahul Gandhi has nothing new to offer. Repetition and Rahul Gandhi stand hand in hand. In every press conference he uses the same vocabulary. If you hear all his press conferences together, you will not know which one is which.“On the Supreme Court order also he used the same vocabulary,” Patra saidAsserting that the issue was not taken to the court either by Gandhi or the Congress, patra said it is based on “surmises and unsubstantiated reports… the committee will do its investigations. Union Minister Aswini Vaishnaw had already given his statement in the Parliament which is also there in the annexure of the affidavit. We have seen their (Congress) conduct when the statement was being presented in Parliament,” he said.Patra also questioned Gandhi whether he “really has faith in the court”.“Whenever the Supreme Court announces its verdict the Congress Party and Rahul Gandhi attacks it. We have seen it happen in the case of the verdicts on Ram Mandir and Rafale…we saw how in every issue he attacks the court. The BJP is a democratic party, we believe in democracy. Truth shall prevail,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-verdict-bjp-welcomes-sc-order-calls-it-as-per-government-affidavit-330437
27-10-2021||New Delhi||SC refuses bail to gangster Abu Salem in 1995 Pradeep Jain murder case||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to grant bail to extradited gangster Abu Salem serving life imprisonment in the 1995 murder case of Mumbai-based builder Pradeep Jain. A bench of Chief Justice NV Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli said: “This is an application filed on behalf of the applicant/appellant seeking bail during the pendency of the appeal. Having heard counsel for the parties and carefully perusing the averments made in the application, we are not inclined to grant bail to the applicant/appellant”.The bench, however, taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the case, directed the Registry to list his appeals against the February 2015 verdict of the special TADA court, for final disposal in the third week of November 2021.On February 25, 2015, the special TADA court had awarded Salem life imprisonment for murdering the builder, along with his driver Mehndi Hassan.Another accused in the case Virendra Jhamb’s sentence was set off against the period of detention undergone by him in prison during the various stages of investigation in the case.According to police, on March 7, 1995, Jain was shot dead by assailants outside his Juhu bungalow after he allegedly refused to part with his huge property to Salem.While one other accused Naeem Khan had turned approver, another accused Riyaz Siddiqui, who had also become approver, later turned hostile in the court. The trial of Siddiqui was later separated.The court, in January 2014 had dropped some charges against Salem in the case on the request of prosecution which said that some changes need to be withdrawn to maintain cordial relations between two sovereign countries—India and Portugal.Salem, also a convict in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, was extradited from Portugal on November 11, 2005, after a prolonged legal battle. The Supreme Court of Portugal, in 2012, had dismissed an appeal of the CBI which had challenged the termination of his extradition.In June 2012, Salem was shot at in Taloja Central Jail in Navi Mumbai allegedly by gangster Devendra Jagtap alias JD, an accused in the murder case of advocate Shahid Azmi who had represented a 26/11 Mumbai attack accused.In June 2017 Salem was convicted and later awarded a life sentence for his role in the 1993 serial blast case in Mumbai.Salem was found guilty of transporting weapons from Gujarat to Mumbai ahead of the blasts.On March 12, 1993, the country’s commercial capital had witnessed an unprecedented attack with a series of 12 bomb explosions that took place one after another in about two hours.The dastardly attacks had left 257 dead, 713 persons seriously injured, and destroyed properties worth crores.In 2020, a Portugal court has dismissed a plea of Salem claiming that the Indian government had violated the condition of his extradition. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-bail-to-gangster-abu-salem-in-1995-pradeep-jain-murder-case-330436

27-10-2021||Aditi Tandon||SC probe into Pegasus issue a big step, will still raise it in Parliament: Rahul||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 27The Congress on Wednesday hailed the Supreme Court order of probe into Pegasus spyware issue saying it would still raise the issue in Parliament to hold the government accountable for key questions the snooping row has raised.Addressing the press today, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi termed Pegasus an illegal tool to attack Indian democracy and the idea of India, saying, “It is a big step that the SC had said it will look into the matter.We are confident we will get the truth in the matter.”Gandhi, however, said the issue would resonate in Parliament in the upcoming session as these are many questions awaiting answers and the opposition would want the government to have a debate on the issue.“Pegasus is an attack on the democratic structure of the country, the constitution. We had jointly stormed parliament on the issue. We will raise the issue in Parliament and our three basic questions are —who authorised the use of Pegasus, a weapon; who were its victims and whether the data of Indians is lying with some other country,” asked Rahul.He said the Pegasus spyware use could have only been authorised by the prime minister or the home minister and it was used to “attack the conversations and vibrancy of Indian democracy and to control people”.The muted opposition you see is due to this, Gandhi said, adding that if the PM used Pegasus as a personal tool to get information on opposition leaders, chief ministers and the CEC, it would mean a criminal act.“We will pursue this issue. The PM is not above the nation or institutions.” Gandhi also said the government attacked national security using Pegasus spyware and it was ironic they raised the national security bogey to evade SC queries in the matter as the SC also noted today.The Congress leader also said since the matter was before the apex court, the party would not press for a JPC probe.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-probe-into-pegasus-issue-a-big-step-will-still-raise-it-in-parliament-rahul-330418

I told her I am fine,” said the septuagenarian leader, underscoring his personal equation with the Congress president which has kept the RJD-Congress alliance afloat in the choppy waters of politics.“I also said that she is the leader of a party with an all-India presence and she should convene a meeting of all like-minded parties which are opposed to the BJP,” said Prasad, whose party recently snubbed the Congress with its unilateral decision to contest by-polls to both the seats.The Congress had reacted with uncharacteristic aggression, with the AICC in-charge of Bihar Bhakt Charan Das asserting that his party, which has fielded its own candidates for the two seats in the by-poll, will contest all 40 Lok Sabha seats in the next general elections.Later, Prasad addressed the rally in Tarapur where huge crowds had turned up to catch a glimpse of the colourful leader who was addressing an election meeting after a gap of six years.Prasad claimed that the RJD-led Grand Alliance had, in the assembly polls last year, fallen short of majority because of “beimaani” (rigging) and that had he not been away in jail, serving sentences in the fodder scam, “they (pliant officials) would not have dared to do so”.He also seethed at Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, his arch rival, who had the previous day said that the RJD supremo “could get me killed”, a sarcastic reference to the former CM’s reputation for strong-arm tactics.“Why do I need to kill him? I have said that I have come to complete his visarjan (political annihilation). He will be finished because of his own deeds. He betrayed us and sided with the BJP though the RJD had helped him return to power in 2015. His prohibition law is a sham,” said Prasad, who, along with wife Rabri Devi, had ruled the state for 15 years on the trot.The former Railway minister also fumed at the high rate of inflation, blaming it on the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and pointing out “today, you have to cough up Rs 50 for buying a platform ticket. This was unthinkable in my time”.The RJD president is scheduled to sign off his electioneering with a rally at Kusheshwar Asthan, a reserved seat that became the bone of contention between his party and the Congress, which has been unsuccessfully contesting from there.The RJD hopes it will break the jinx with its imaginative play of the caste card. It has fielded a candidate belonging to the Musahar community which has a sizeable presence in Kusheshwar Asthan but remains politically under-represented.The party, by fielding a Musahar candidate, also hopes to dilute the age-old animosity in the area between Dalits and Yadavs – the castemen of Prasad – which could come in handy amid the state’s rapidly changing political landscape.

27-10-2021||Mumbai||Cruise drugs party organisers took nod from Centre, not Maharashtra goverment: Nawab Malik||Maharashtra minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik on Wednesday claimed the Cordelia cruise drugs party organisers had taken permission directly from the "directorate of shipping" at the Centre and not the state police or the state home department.Speaking to reporters here, Malik also claimed that a member of an international drugs mafia was present on the same cruise, and asked how he was allowed to go while some others were arrested, following a raid on the ship earlier this month.Malik also said if the Narcotics Control Bureau Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede's birth certificate, which the minister had posted online to claim the official forged documents to secure job, turns out false, then he will resign from his ministerial post and retire as a politician. "I wonder why BJP leaders are getting uncomfortable when I am trying to expose Sameer Wankhede," he said. The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) raided the cruise ship off the Mumbai coast on October 2 during which drugs were allegedly seized. Later, Aryan Khan, actor Shah Rukh Khan's son, and some others were arrested. Malik has repeatedly termed the cruise drug bust case as "fake" and levelled a string of allegations against Wankhede, who led the raid. On Wednesday, the minister said, “The Cordelia cruise drugs party organisers—Fashion TV— had not taken any permission from the Maharashtra Police or the state home department. They obtained the permission directly from the directorate of shipping, which comes under the Union Ministry for Ports, Shipping and Waterways.”  "I believe that a top committee of NCB officials from Delhi has arrived here. They should check the call detail records of personal phones of NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede, (witnesses) K P Gosavi, Prabhakar Sail and Wankhede's driver Mane. You will need no recording of statements. The phone calls will be self-explanatory," he said. The minister also claimed that a member of an international drugs mafia was present on the same cruise. "There are some of videos of the party in which the person, sporting a beard, can been seen. I am told he was in the Tihar Jail (Delhi) and in a Rajasthan jail in the past. The NCB's Delhi team should check the CCTV cameras of the cruise. How come a few people were arrested and the international level drugs mafia (member) is moving scot-free?” the NCP spokesperson asked. Malik also said that if Wankhede's birth certificate, which he had posted on social media, turns out to be false, then "I will resign from my post and retire as a politician". "If my claims are true, then Sameer Wankhede should at least apologise to me and my family. He will lose his job for sure," the minister said. Malik claimed he was giving "clues" to top officials of the NCB who needed to carry out a probe into this matter.   "They should find out who are the friends of Sameer Wankhede and how he is connected with drug dealer Sam D'Souza. As per my information, Kiran Gosavi had moved some Rs 50 lakh cash to his flat and he later gave another bag to Sam D'Souza. These are suspicious movements,” he claimed. Malik also said he was told that lot of drugs supplied to Goa were controlled by the "man with the beard" who was present at the Cordelia cruise party.  "Despite several efforts from the NCB to take action, Sameer Wankhede always opposed initiating any action against these people. The NCB officials should also probe this angle," he said. To a query by reporters, Malik said he had posted on his Twitter handle a picture of Sameer Wankhede and the latter's first wife Shabana Qureshi. "Their marriage took place on December 7, 2006 in the Lokhandwala complex. The marriage registration clearly says that his father's name is Dawood and Sameer Wankhede is a Muslim. One of the witnesses of the marriage was Aziz Khan, husband of Yasmeen Dawood Wankhede- the elder sister of Sameer Wankhede," he said. The minister also claimed he did not use his "political privilege" to find out information about Sameer Wankhede.  "I have not asked any police officials to help me in it. I wonder why BJP leaders are getting uncomfortable when I am trying to expose Sameer Wankhede," the minister said.  Malik had earlier levelled a number of allegations against Sameer Wankhede and also accused him of illegal phone tapping and forging his documents to secure job. Wankhede, who visited the NCB office in Delhi on Tuesday, has denied the allegations. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cruise-drugs-party-organisers-took-nod-from-centre-not-maharashtra-goverment-nawab-malik-330409

27-10-2021||Patna||NIA court convicts 10, acquits one in 2013 Patna serial blasts||A special NIA court on Wednesday convicted 10 persons in connection with the serial blasts that took place in 2013 at the venue here of a political rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was then the chief minister of Gujarat.Special NIA judge Gurvinder Mehrotra, who passed the order, also acquitted one of the accused for want of evidence.“The NIA had submitted charge-sheets against 11 people in the course of investigation. Of these, one was a minor and his case was referred to the juvenile justice board. The remaining were put on trial.“Today, all but one were convicted. The quantum of sentence will be pronounced on November 1,” Special Public Prosecutor Lalan Prasad Singh, who appeared for the probe agency, told PTI-Bhasha.Those who were pronounced guilty are Imtiaz Ansari, Mujibullah, Haider Ali, Firoz Aslam, Omar Ansari, Iftekhar, Ahmed Husain, Umair Siddiqui and Azharuddin. The court acquitted Fakhruddin, he added.The blasts had taken place at the Gandhi Maidan on October 27, 2013, when the BJP’s ‘Hunkar Rally’ addressed by Modi, who had been declared the party’s prime ministerial candidate, was under way.The explosions and the ensuing stampede had claimed six lives, while scores were injured.Although no terror outfit claimed responsibility for the serial blasts, the involvement of SIMI and its new avatar, the Indian Mujahideen, have been suspected.

27-10-2021||New Delhi||Pegasus snooping row: Freedom of press is important pillar of democracy, says SC||Freedom of the press is an “important pillar” of democracy, the Supreme Court observed on Wednesday and said the court’s task in the Pegasus matter assumes great significance with regard to the importance of protection of journalistic sources and the “potential chilling effect” that snooping techniques may have.The apex court, which appointed a three-member expert panel to probe into the alleged use of Israeli spyware Pegasus for surveillance of certain people in India, highlighted the aspect pertaining to the freedom of press and said it is compelled to take up the cause in the matter to determine truth and get to the bottom of the allegations made.A bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana said it is undeniable that surveillance and the knowledge that one is under the threat of being spied on can affect the way an individual decides to exercise his or her rights.“Such a scenario might result in self-censorship. This is of particular concern when it relates to the freedom of the press, which is an important pillar of democracy. Such chilling effect on the freedom of speech is an assault on the vital public-watchdog role of the press, which may undermine the ability of the press to provide accurate and reliable information,” said the bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli.In its 46-page order passed on a batch of pleas seeking independent probe into the alleged Pegasus snooping matter, the top court said protection of journalistic sources is one of the basic conditions for the freedom of press and without it sources may be deterred from assisting the media in informing the public on matters of public interest.“Having regard to the importance of the protection of journalistic sources for press freedom in a democratic society and the potential chilling effect that snooping techniques may have, this court’s task in the present matter, where certain grave allegations of infringement of the rights of the citizens of the country have been raised, assumes great significance,” it said. Referring to the apex court judgement delivered in January last year on pleas against curbs imposed in Jammu and Kashmir after the Centre’s abrogation of provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave special status to the erstwhile state, the bench said in that verdict the court had highlighted the importance of freedom of press in a modern democracy.“An important and necessary corollary of such a right is to ensure the protection of sources of information,” it said.It said initially, the court was not satisfied with the pleas filed in the matter as they were completely reliant only upon certain newspaper reports.The bench said the apex court has generally attempted to discourage writ petitions, particularly public interest litigations, which are based entirely on newspaper reports without any additional steps taken by the petitioner.“While we understand that the allegations made in these petitions pertain to matters about which ordinary citizens would not have information except for the investigating reporting done by news agencies, looking to the quality of some of the petitions filed, we are constrained to observe that individuals should not file half-baked petitions merely on a few newspaper reports,” it said.The top court said such an exercise, far from helping the cause espoused by an individual filing the plea, is often detrimental to the cause itself.“This is because the court will not have proper assistance in the matter, with the burden to even determine preliminary facts being left to the court. It is for this reason that trigger happy filing of such petitions in courts, and more particularly in this court which is to be the final adjudicatory body in the country, needs to be discouraged,” the bench said.It said this should not be taken to mean that news agencies are not trusted by court, but to emphasise the role that each pillar of democracy occupies in the polity.The bench said news agencies report facts and bring to light issues that might otherwise not be publicly known and these may then become the basis for further action taken by an active and concerned civil society as well as for any subsequent filings made in courts.“But newspaper reports, in and of themselves, should not in the ordinary course be taken to be readymade pleadings that may be filed in court,” it said.The bench said later, various other pleas were filed in the court, including by individuals who were purportedly victims of the alleged Pegasus spyware attack.It said the subsequently filed petitions and additional documents filed by others have brought on record certain materials that cannot be brushed aside. “Additionally, the sheer volume of cross—referenced and cross-verified reports from various reputable news organizations across the world along with the reactions of foreign governments and legal institutions also moved us to consider that this is a case where the jurisdiction of the court may be exercised,” it said.It noted that during the arguments, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had suggested that many of these reports are “motivated and self­serving”.“However, such an omnibus oral allegation is not sufficient to desist from interference,” it said.An international media consortium had reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for alleged surveillance using Israeli firm NSO’s spyware Pegasus. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pegasus-snooping-row-freedom-of-press-is-important-pillar-of-democracy-says-sc-330403
27-10-2021||Mumbai||Qazi claims Wankhede was Muslim at the time of his first marriage; NCB officer says he never converted||The Qazi who had performed the first marriage of Sameer Wankhede, the Mumbai zonal director of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in 2006, on Wednesday claimed the officer belonged to a Muslim family otherwise the ‘nikah’ would not have been solemnised as per Islam.The Qazi’s claim came in the backdrop of Maharashtra minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik’s allegations that Wankhede was born Muslim, but forged documents, including a caste certificate, to show that he belonged to the Hindu SC category to get a job under quota after clearing the UPSC examination.Now, Nawab Malik celebrates 'nikaah' of 'sweet couple Sameer Dawood Wankhede-Shabana Quraishi'“I had performed the ‘nikah’ of Sameer Wankhede and Shabana Qureshi. Her father had approached me to perform the marriage in the Lokhandwala complex area of Mumbai. The groom’s name was Sameer Dawood Wankhede who married Shabana Qureshi,” Maulana Mujammil Ahmed told a news channel.When asked about Wankhede’s claim that he is Hindu the Qazi said had Sameer Wankhede been a Hindu the ‘nikah’ would not have been performed.“I can remember it was a joyful wedding for sure,” he said.The Maulana also claimed that all the witnesses had signed the Nikahnama as per Islamic customs.“If Sameer Wankhede and his family members are claiming that he is Hindu by birth and that his father is also Hindu, then I would say it is wrong,” he added.He also claimed that the “Mehar” amount mentioned in the nikahnama was Rs 33,000.“Mehar” in Islam is a security deposit. The term “Mehar” signifies a contract made by the groom and his family to his bride at the time of their nikkah.     Wankhede had said that his father is a Hindu and his late mother Zaheeda was Muslim.Wankhede had also said he belongs to a “composite, multi-religious and secular family in true Indian tradition” and he is proud of his heritage.The NCB officer also stated that he married Dr Shabana Qureshi in 2006 under the Special Marriage Act. Both of them divorced mutually through a civil court in 2016. Later, in 2017, he married Marathi actress Kranti Redkar, the official added.As the controversy over his marriage and religion refused to die down, Wankhede, who is in the eye of a political storm following allegations of extortion in the high-profile cruise drugs case in which actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan was arrested, on Wednesday said he had married (in 2006) as per Muslim customs as per the wish of his late mother.“Fulfilling the wish of one’s mother in a secular country is not a crime. I am proud of secularism in our country. My mother was Muslim and my father is Hindu. I love both of them very much,” Wankhede told PTI.Wankhede asserted that he never converted to Islam and he belonged to a Hindu caste.He said his first marriage was registered under the Special Marriage Act within a month. “The process of divorce was also completed as per the Special Marriage Act. I was never converted to Islam and I belong to a Hindu caste of my family,” Wankhede claimed.Meanwhile, Wankhede’s father once again refuted allegations of Nawab Malik about his religion. Malik had said Wankhede senior’s real name is Dawood Wankhede and not Dnyandev Wankhede.“I do not understand Urdu, hence I am not aware what my name was written in their documents (nikahnama). She (my late wife) might have mentioned my name as Dawood affectionately. People do call each other with different names out of love,” he told reporters.He said all the government documents mentioned his name as Dnyandev Wankhede. “When the state government recruited me, they must have done some verification as well,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/qazi-claims-wankhede-was-muslim-at-the-time-of-his-first-marriage-ncb-officer-says-he-never-converted-330402

27-10-2021||New Delhi||‘Jumla’ version of Covid-19 vaccine story will not save lives: Rahul||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said actual vaccinations and not the “jumla (rhetoric) version” of the Covid-19 vaccine story would save lives and pointed out to the large number of people who are yet to be vaccinated in the country.He shared an article by Congress president Sonia Gandhi in a newspaper, which lauded Indian scientists and researchers on achieving the 100-core vaccination milestone but pointed out to the large number of people and children who are yet to be inoculated against Covid-19.“Jumla-version of the vaccine story won’t save lives. Actual vaccination will,” he said on Twitter using the hashtag “#DutyToVaccinate”.The Congress also shared on Twitter Sonia Gandhi’s article and quoted her, “The PM likes to emphasise that vaccines are free, while conveniently forgetting that they have always been free. It is the BJP government that moved away from India’s universal free vaccination policy.”              Sharing the article on Twitter, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, “The floundering economy can be turned around if we can drive away the dark clouds of COVID19. That requires us to ramp up the pace of the rollout of vaccines to all, completely free, including to our children.”Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also quoted the Congress president and said, “Not hollow announcements but genuine execution is the key to not only health of our citizens but wealth of our Nation”.“Vaccine for all..including our children.. usher in the festive season…with genuine optimism,” he also said quoting Sonia Gandhi and shared her article on Twitter.                             In the article, “The vaccination milestone and a distant goal”, Sonia Gandhi pointed out that the government ought to realise that vaccinating all Indians as quickly as possible is linked to their health and progress.“Our frontline health-care workers deserve our fulsome congratulations for crossing the milestone of 100 crore COVID-19 vaccine doses. They, along with our scientists, researchers, medical professionals, and vaccine manufacturers, have heroically overcome multiple obstacles in the quest to protect our citizens from COVID-19. Thanks to their efforts, our vaccination drive has picked up pace after the initial months of delay, indecision, and confusion,” Gandhi has said in her article.She also said that this milestone also marks the triumph of science and of India’s research and manufacturing infrastructure built and nurtured over decades.The Congress president has also pointed out that the promise of all eligible Indians being doubly vaccinated by the end of 2021 is unlikely to be accomplished.“The hollow announcement has not been accompanied by either appropriate planning or execution. Experts assert that we will miss this target by at least five to six months,” she said.

27-10-2021||Mumbai||Now, Nawab Malik celebrates 'nikaah' of 'sweet couple Sameer Dawood Wankhede-Shabana Quraishi'||In another shocker, the Nationalist Congress Party Minister Nawab Malik on Wednesday presented the purported 'nikaah' (Muslim marriage certificate) of Narcotics Control Bureau Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede, a day after the latter's wife and sister rubbished all allegations.In a series of tweets, Malik posted the wedding photo of the 'Sweet Couple' and the 'nikaah-nama' of Sameer Dawood Wankhede's first marriage with Dr. Shabana Quraishi, performed on December 7, 2006 at 8 p.m. in Lokhandwala Complex in Andheri west."The 'mehr' amount was Rs 33,000... The witness No. 2 was Aziz Khan, husband of Yasmeen Dawood Wankhede, the sister of Sameer Dawood Wankhede," Malik said.He reiterated that the exposures about Sameer Dawood Wankhede were not about his religion, as is being portrayed in some quarters, including the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party."I want to bring to light the fraudulent means by which he has obtained a caste certificate to get an IRS job and has deprived a deserving Scheduled Caste (SC) person of his future," Malik declared.Wankhede has earlier stated that he and Dr Qureishi divorced with mutual consent and he later married Marathi actress Kranti Redkar-Wankhede.The latest revelations came a day after Redkar-Wankhede and Yasmeen Wankhede-Wankhede's wife and sister, respectively -- slammed the minister for the personal attacks and resorting to 'kitchen politics', and challenging him to prove his allegations before the courts.Their ire stemmed from the serial exposes by Malik over the past three weeks on Wankhede, topped off Tuesday with a stunning claim that the over Rs 1,000-crore has been extorted from Bollywood people in Mumbai and Maldives.The NCP Minister's contention is that Wankhede had allegedly submitted forged caste certificates to get a central government job under SC quotas even though he is a Muslim -- a charge vehemently denied by the Wankhede's father, sister and others.The NCP leader now plans to forward all the documents to the Caste Verification Committee for probe and necessary action.Malik's independent investigations into Wankhede's background and the allegations of corruption plaguing the NCB has both rattled and regaled many in the central probe agency, besides triggering a massive political row with a series of accusations and counter-accusations hurled.The NCB is sending a team to investigate and verify the charges against Wankhede after a 'Panch-Witness' Prabhakar Sail's purported affidavit making startling allegations of an extortion bid from Shah Rukh Khan to release his son Aryan Khan, accused in the cruiser party raid.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/now-nawab-malik-celebrates-nikaah-of-sweet-couple-sameer-dawood-wankhede-shabana-quraishi-330359

And together with Japan and Australia, it would enable the United States to form a real deterrent to potential terrorist threats in Afghanistan as well as to counter China,” they said.Arguing that post-withdrawal, it is only India which can effectively keep a watchful eye on Afghanistan, Haley and Waltz wrote that only New Delhi can keep track of China's southern flank.“India operates Farkhor Air Base in Tajikistan, the only air base with the proximity to conduct counterterrorism strikes in Afghanistan. With an alliance, India could allow us access to strategic bases to protect US interests in Afghanistan and the broader region,” they wrote.“A US-India alliance would also give us an edge over China. Like the United States, India recognises that China is a rapidly growing threat. Not only is it attempting to capitalise on our withdrawal from Afghanistan, which goes against both the United States and India's interests, China is also pressuring India on its own borders,” Haley and Waltz said.The two Republican leaders said that a US-India alliance would give China pause before further expanding into Central and Southern Asia.

27-10-2021||Washington||Indian military cannot operate effectively without Russian supplied equipment: CRS report||There has been a considerable drop in India’s dependence on arms and equipments from Russia but the Indian military cannot operate effectively without Russian-supplied equipment and will continue to rely on its weapons systems in the near and middle terms, a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report has said.The report comes ahead of a crucial decision that the Biden administration has to take on India buying military arms from Russia, whether it plans to impose sanctions against the country under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) ."Many analysts in India and beyond conclude that the Indian military cannot operate effectively without Russian-supplied equipment and will continue to rely on Russian weapons systems in the near and middle terms," the independent CRS said in a report 'Russian Arms Sales and Defence Industry'."As put by one senior American observer, New Delhi's continuing purchases 'remain one of the few levers of influence that India still possesses vis-à vis Moscow'. In this sense, much of Moscow's influence in India comes through its willingness to provide weapons systems and technologies that no other country will export to India. Russia also continues to offer advanced weapons platforms at relatively attractive rates," the CRS said.The CRS prepares periodic reports on various issues using independent subject experts. Its reports are not official reports of the Congress and are prepared to help lawmakers take informed decisions.A graph showed that since 2015, under the Modi government, there has been a consistent drop in import of equipment from Russia.Noting that India's plan to purchase Russian-made S-400 air defense systems, in progress since 2016, could trigger US sanctions under Section 231 of CAATSA, the CRS said Indian planners appear to have concluded that alternatives to the S-400 offered by Washington - the Patriot and THAAD systems - lack the purported range and versatility of the Russian equipment."Despite a trend away from Russian arms imports, India in late 2019 submitted USD 800 million towards the full USD 5.4 billion contract for S-400 systems (it also entered a new USD 3.1 billion contract for indigenous production of 464 Russian-designed T-90S tanks)," it said.The CRS said recent press reports indicate that New Delhi is going "full steam ahead" with the induction of S-400 and added that the first deliveries are set for autumn 2021, to be completed by early 2023.It said that in August 2021, Russian officials stated that S-400 deliveries would begin by the end of 2021.The CRS report said that since 2010, Russia has been the source of nearly two-thirds (62 per cent) of all Indian arms imports and India has been the largest Russian arms importer, accounting for nearly one-third (32 per cent) of all Russian arms exports, according to SIPRI.Between 2016 and 2020, India accounted for nearly one-quarter (23 per cent) of Russia's total arms exports and Russia accounted for roughly half (49 per cent) of Indian imports, it said.

27-10-2021||New Delhi||Ministry proposes 40 kmph speed limit for motorcycles with child pillion passenger||To introduce safety measures for child passengers, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has proposed that the speed limit of a motorcycle, with a child up to 4 years of age being carried as a pillion, shall not be more than 40 kmph.The ministry in a draft notification has also proposed that the driver shall ensure that the child pillion passenger, aged between 9 months and 4 years, must wear a crash helmet.“The speed of the motorcycle with the child up to age 4 years being carried as a pillion, shall not be more than 40 kmph,” according to the draft notification issued by the ministry.The ministry further said the driver of a motorcycle shall ensure that for children below four years, safety harness shall be used for attaching the child to the driver of the motorcycle.A safety harness is a vest to be worn by the child, which shall be adjustable, with a pair of straps attached to the vest and forming shoulder loops to be worn by the driver.“This way, the upper torso of the child is securely attached to the driver. A feature by which this is achieved is by attaching the straps to the back of the vest and crossing the straps over the vest so that two large crossing-over loops are formed that pass between the legs of the passenger,” the ministry explained.The protective gear, including safety harness has to be lightweight, adjustable, waterproof and durable, according to the draft notification.This must be made of heavy nylon or multi-filament nylon material with high-density foam and should be designed to hold weight up to 30 kg.The MoRTH has also asked for objections and suggestions to these draft rules, if any.International Road Federation (IRF) a global road safety body working for better and safer roads has welcomed the proposal by the MoRTH to limit the speed of a two-wheelers with a child up to four ages of age as a pillion passenger to not more than 40 kmph.“A two-wheeler is more often than not the only mode of transport for lower and middle class families. The new rule, when implemented rigorously, will naturally help curb accidents,” K K Kapila, President Emeritus, International Road (IRF) said.

What should matter to each and every one of us is the strengthening of the organisation. — Sonia Gandhi, Congress Chief“I would like to re-emphasise the paramount need for discipline and unity. What should matter to each and every one of us is the strengthening of the organisation. In this lies both collective and individual success,” she said at a meeting of party general secretaries, in-charges and state chiefs held at the AICC headquarters to discuss election preparedness and cadre training to counter what she described as the BJP-RSS’ “malicious propaganda”.The three-hour meeting discussed the Congress membership drive that will commence from November 1 until March 31 next year.Stressing equally the need to train party workers in Congress ideology and equip them to take on the BJP, Sonia said, “The fight to defend democracy, Constitution and Congress ideology begins with being fully prepared to identify and counter false propaganda.”She noted that the Congress must train its workers to take on the unceasing onslaught of malicious disinformation campaigns at the behest of the BJP and RSS.Sonia’s abiding message was, however, one of discipline. The message came when several state units of the Congress were beset with internal squabbling. In a sigh of relief for the party, Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu attended the meeting.Sonia rued that the Congress messaging was not percolating to the masses and policy issues were shrouded by confusions. “The AICC releases important statements almost every day on issues facing the nation. But they do not percolate down to our grass-root cadres at the block and district levels. There are policy issues on which I find a lack of clarity and cohesion even among our state-level leaders,” Sonia noted, urging priority for training of cadres.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-gandhi-congress-strengthening-must-override-personal-ambitions-330132

But the proposal saw no progress, prompting the TMC to decide to go its own way to expand its base, Roy said.“The proposal was given by the TMC chairperson herself. Besides Sonia, she also met other leaders,” Roy said today.The TMC leader said they waited for six months, but there was no response from other opposition parties, including the Congress. “Perhaps the Congress is too busy with its internal issues,” Roy remarked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-cant-wait-for-congress-to-unite-oppn-against-bjp-330138

Eyewitness evidence is more credible. It is always better to have first-hand evidence,” the Bench noted.“There was a crowd of 4,000-5,000 persons, who were all locals. Most of them were agitating even after the incident. This is what has been reported. All of them are serious witnesses. The identification of these people should not be a problem,” it said.As the CJI said, identification was important, Salve said, “All 16 accused have been identified.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/protect-lakhimpur-kheri-witnesses-file-separate-report-on-lynching-of-4-men-sc-to-up-330114

All five arrested have been sent to judicial custody.Caught by CBICBI officials said the probe agency had initiated action in a secret operation last month in which two retired Navy officers and as many private persons in addition to the serving officer were taken into custody.The agency has so far conducted searches at 19 locations in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and a few other places from where they have seized important documents and digital evidence. All the seized material is being examined, the officials said.It is alleged that the Commander had discussed crucial details about the ongoing modernisation project of Kilo-class submarine with the two retired officers for illegal gratification, the officials said.The Anti-Corruption Unit of the CBI, which handles sensitive and high-profile cases, was tasked to unearth the leakage of information following which the operation was undertaken.The CBI search team has also questioned several other officers and ex-servicemen who were in regular touch with the arrested officer and retired personnel.The agency is conducting a forensic analysis of digital devices used by the officer to find out if the information has fallen into the hands of people with vested interests.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/navy-commander-2-retd-officers-held-for-leaking-sub-info-330116

The Prime Minister’s Office did not issue an official notification of Lt General Anjum’s appointment as the new ISI chief, leading to speculation about the strain in civil-military relations.For days, rumours of an army takeover had swirled in Islamabad. Lately, the government’s troubles multiplied after it faced a law and order threat from Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a radical Islamist organisation. The Bajwa-Imran Khan rapprochement coincided with an end to protests by the TLP that had claimed 10 lives, including those of three policemen.On Tuesday, all trappings of a set procedure were followed. General Bajwa called on the Pakistan PM and presented a panel of three officers. The PM “interviewed all the nominees” and then held a round of “final consultations” with General Bajwa. “After this detailed consultative process, the name of Lt General Anjum was approved as the new DG ISI. The designated DG ISI shall assume charge on November 20,” said a statement from the Pakistan PMO.Though it was clear within days that the will of the Pakistan army would prevail, the manner in which the resolution should be done took time.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/imran-khan-relents-army-has-its-say-over-isi-chief-pick-330121
