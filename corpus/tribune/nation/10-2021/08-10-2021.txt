Our only demand is that the Minister is dismissed immediately and all accused are arrested”.“We want a commission of two sitting judges to be set up under whose supervision an SIT should be formed and the guilty punished within 30 days,” he added, saying that only then the Constitution and the law could be saved otherwise “people will lose faith in them”.“Modiji, you did not follow ‘Raj Dharma’ after Atal Bihari Vajpayee told you to do so earlier. But this is a test for him (Modi) to follow ‘Raj Dharma’ now,” he said.Surjewala also demanded the constitution of a special bench to hear the pending murder case against Ajay Mishra and decide on it on its next date of hearing on October 20. A case of murder of one Prabhat Gupta was registered against the Minister and the verdict of the revision petition filed in the Allahabad High Court is pending for three-and-half years.Violence had broken out on Sunday after two SUVs allegedly ran over a group of anti-farm law protesters who were demonstrating against the visit of Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya at Tikonia-Banbirpur road in Lakhimpur Kheri. Eight people were killed in the violence which included four farmers.Union Minister Ajay Mishra’s son has been accused of hitting farmers with his vehicle in Lakhimpur Kheri.

The technology has immense application in the strategic sector such as satellite communication and defence industry, which at present depends upon costly imports.Referred to as Low-Temperature Cofired Ceramic (LTCC) tapes and High-Temperature Cofired Ceramic (HTCC) substrates the technology is in the fifth stage of ‘Technology Readiness’ and is being supplied by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for tests.If the testing is successful, the technology can be employed in several microwave components like ‘S’ and ‘C’ band receivers in satellite transponders. ISRO requires thousands of tapes and substrates every year. Deference research laboratories and some defence public sector undertakings also require them.Low orbit satellites which are in demand today need a sustainable technology for compact satellite volume and mass, besides reduced production time and affordable cost. Hybrid micro-systems based on LTCC technology that integrates components such as capacitor, resistor, inductor, resonator and filter into a multilayered ceramic module, is a potential solution in future communication satellites due to their outstanding performance and moderate cost.Dr KP Surendran, Principal Scientist at CSIR’s National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology (NIIST) developed a series of LTCC tapes and HTCC substrates that have dielectric properties or the ability of storing electric energy in an electric field. A patent has already been filed on tape casting of HTCC substrate based on zircon. An aqueous tape casting technique has been developed, which is relatively free from health hazards, since it does not employ volatile organic components like xylene and methyl ethyl ketone.According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology today, a project for developing an all-gold system as a substitute for the imported LTCC tape system has also been proposed under the ISRO Respond programme. Commercial exploration and mass production of this product is also being planned after testing the gold paste-based LTCC tapes by ISRO.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/csir-develops-tech-to-replace-costly-imported-electronic-items-in-satellites-321923

08-10-2021||Mumbai||I-T Dept raided Ajit Pawar’s kin because I likened Lakhimpur incident to Jallianwala Bagh: Sharad Pawar||NCP president Sharad Pawar on Friday reiterated that the Income Tax Department’s raids on Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar’s relatives and aides came after his comparison of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in Uttar Pradesh to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre during the British rule.Speaking at a meeting of his party in Solapur, Pawar wondered if people had the right to express their views freely in the country. “The I-T raids were carried out because I likened the Lakhimpur Kheri violence to Jallianwala Bagh massacre...Don’t we have the right to air our views in democracy?” he asked. The I-T department on Thursday raided some businesses linked to family members of Ajit Pawar and some real estate developers on charges of alleged tax evasion. The premises linked to business groups such as DB Realty, Shivalik, Jarandeshwar Sahkari Sugar Karkhana (Jarandeshwar SSK) and businesses linked to Ajit Pawar’s sisters were raided during the operation, official sources had said. On Tuesday, Pawar had drawn a parallel between the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, in which eight persons were killed, and the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, and said people would show the BJP its place. The former Union minister on Friday alleged that the BJP-led Central Government was leaving no stone unturned to trouble the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government (of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) in Maharashtra. “The state government is not being given its rightful share in the central funds,” he added. “We need to remove the BJP from our path. In the recent bypolls of local bodies, the MVA allies, which contested separately, won 70 per cent of the seats. There is no doubt in my mind that if we fight together we will get better results. We have to now figure out how to contest the future elections,” he said. Pawar accused the BJP of being “anti-farmer” and indulging in “misuse of power”. He said that a complete shutdown should be observed during the October 11 ‘Maharashtra bandh’ and it should be carried out in a peaceful manner. “Nothing should be open except the essential services,” he said. The Maharashtra Cabinet had on Wednesday expressed regret over the death of farmers in the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri, while the ruling allies here called for a statewide bandh on October 11 to protest against the incident in the Uttar Pradesh district as they sought to corner the BJP over the tragedy. The Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress, allies in the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), gave the call for Maharashtra bandh to protest against the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight people, four of them farmers, were killed on Sunday.

08-10-2021||Lucknow||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: No action will be taken under pressure, without evidence, says UP Chief Minister Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath on Friday said no arrest will be made without evidence in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case and termed opposition leaders heading to meet the bereaved families as “no goodwill messengers”.The violence left eight people, including four farmers, dead on Sunday.“Everyone is equal before the law and according to the Supreme Court, no one can be arrested without evidence, and investigation is underway. FIR has been lodged against a written complaint and no one will be spared,” the chief minister said at a conclave organised by a private news channel.Adityanath also stressed that there will be no injustice with anyone and no action will be taken under any pressure.“There is no place for violence in a democracy, and when the law is giving guarantee to secure everyone, there is no need to take it into one’s hands, whosoever they be,” he said.Attacking opposition leaders, who are going to Lakhimpur Kheri after the incident, he said: “They are no goodwill messengers”.“The priority of the government is to maintain peace and harmony. Many faces among those who wanted to go to Kheri are behind the incident. However, things will become clear after investigation,” the chief minister said.On allegations that attempts are being made to save BJP leader and Union Minister Ajay Mishra’s son, Ashish Mishra, who is named in the FIR in the case, Adityanath said: “There is no such video. We have issued numbers, and if anyone has evidence, they can upload it. All will be crystal clear. There will be no injustice with anyone. No one will be allowed to take the law in his hand but no action will be taken under any pressure”.“We will not arrest anyone on allegations. But yes, if someone is guilty, he will also not be spared irrespective of who he is,” he stressed.Four of the eight people who died on Sunday were farmers, allegedly knocked down by vehicles carrying BJP workers. Angry farmers then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles. The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver.Farmers have claimed that Ashish Mishra was in one of the vehicles, an allegation denied by him and his father who say they can produce evidence to prove he was at an event at that time.Referring to a video of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra sweeping the floor of a guesthouse’s room where she was kept in Sitapur after being stopped from going to Lakhimpur Kheri, Adityanath said: “They have been reduced to this by the people of the state”.                On the controversy over his “Abba jaan” remark, he said: “Abba jaan is not an unparliamentary word. There are political parties who want Muslim votes but are shying away from the word Abba jaan”. Referring to Union Minister Ajay Mishra’s and Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s speeches against the farmers’ protest, which allegedly led to anger among the people, Adityanath said: “There is a difference between a political speech and a threat”.         “There is no meaning of such statements during political speeches as they are made according to the condition. However, one should take care. It is not only limited to BJP leaders as other party leaders also make such political statements. However, no one can take the law into their hands and kill any passerby,” he said.On Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav’s claims that Adityanath is only cutting ribbons and signing MoUs but no investment is coming to the state, the chief minister said: “Akhilesh ji has no time to know these things as he is the son of a rich man”.       “He wakes up at 12 noon, gets ready by 2 pm and meets his friends. By 4 pm, he goes for cycling. When the people were in need, he was touring Australia and London. I wish him to go to Australia or Europe and have fun, I will be happy that one man of Uttar Pradesh has become NRI,” Adityanath said.On AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi alleging that 35 per cent Muslims are feeling harassed, Adityanath said: “If he could give a statement on the incidents in Kashmir, where Hindus and Sikhs are being killed, he would have become leader”.         About Owaisi calling Ayodhya as Faizabad, the chief minister said: “Ayodha will be Ayodhya but Hyderabad will become Bhagyanagar”.On the issue of illegal religious conversion, he said: “We have made a law against it.  Bargaining in the name of service or for love jihad is not acceptable”.“The Goraksha Peeth and thousands of organisations serve people but do not bargain for conversion. I advise the governments of states like Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan to focus on such issues,” he said.The chief minister also praised Shivpal Singh Yadav, the estranged uncle of Akhilesh Yadav, and former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh as leaders having massive people’s support. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-no-action-will-be-taken-under-pressure-without-evidence-says-up-chief-minister-adityanath-321898

Unfortunately, there are no quickfix solutions to the deep-rooted problems and structural weakness of GOP”.His pointing to “deep-rooted problems and structural weakness” in the Congress appeared to hint towards its internal troubles in Punjab, Rajasthan, and perhaps his own disenchantment with the GOP, or the Grand Old Party, observers say. This after reports that he was in negotiations with the Gandhis to create a role within the Congress that would give him power and responsibility to bring it out of the political slump.Observers, and also those within the Congress, say his entry could have further complicated the matters for the party at a time it is barely managing to hold itself together amid the pressure from the “G-23”, a group of senior Congress leaders wanting an organisational overhaul of the embattled party.“Reports of his discussions for a free hand in reworking the structure with the Gandhis did not go down well with many,” say sources. Apparently, many in the party also found him having “too many demands”.Meanwhile, Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala refused to comment on Kishor’s observation saying “I do not comment on the remarks made by any consultant”.Regarding a statement by West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee that “only TMC can take on the BJP as the Congress has failed” against the saffron party”, Surjewala said in politics everyone has the right to look for opportunities. “Ultimately, it is the people who decide. In Uttar Pradesh, the fight on the ground is only and only being led by Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi,” the Congress leader said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-quickfix-solutions-to-deep-rooted-problems-and-structural-weakness-of-congress-prashant-kishor-321890
08-10-2021||Vibha Sharma||Upcoming Assembly elections: Has Congress forced saffron forces to tweak strategy||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 8It has been a while since the BJP has talked of a “Congress-mukt Bharat”, a very common phrase by the saffron leaders to run down the grand old party.The seemingly interesting shift in strategy (if one at all) comes ahead of elections to five states early next year, of which at least in two the Congress is a direct contender - Punjab and Uttarakhand. While Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and sister Priyanka have successfully managed to keep the heat on against BJP's Yogi Adityanath in Uttar Pradesh, key stakeholders Samajwadi Party and BSP have not been so successful so far.  Whether it helps the Congress in UP remains to be seen, but observers maintain that landing of two Congress chief ministers, one Dalit and one OBC, in UP will “positively” affect the grand old party's prospects in Punjab and Uttarakhand. "Visiting UP by Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, a Dalit, and Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, an OBC, and both announcing more compensation than the BJP's Yogi Adityanath government, has been an excellent move," say political analysts who are following the developments in poll-bound states.Though the Congress has not been in such a great shape in UP it once ruled (recently it also lost some senior leaders to the main opposition party, (Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party), it has a certain vote share that has the potential to dent best of plans in tough situations, like the one the BJP is currently facing. While the Opposition has been successful in maintaining pressure, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "silence" over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident has also not helped the BJP's situation, they add.However, despite the attention its top leaders have been grabbing, the Congress is not in a very great shape in UP.Recently, its two prominent Bundelkhand leaders and former MLAs, Gayadeen Anuragi and Vinod Chaturvedi, joined the SP and speculation is that more may follow.Clearly, losing elections consecutively, Congress leaders feel Akhilesh Yadav stands a better chance as the SP has a strong cadre across the state. With the RLD as an alliance partner in western UP, the Akhilesh Yadav-led party stands a better chance.Though the developments since Lakhimpur Kheri appear to have revived interest for the Congress in the state, claim observers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/upcoming-assembly-elections-has-congress-forced-saffron-forces-to-tweak-strategy-321886
08-10-2021||Mumbai||Was BJP leader's brother-in-law among two let off by NCB after cruise ship raid in Mumbai?||Stepping up its attack on the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), the NCP on Friday alleged that the anti-drug agency let off two persons after a raid on a cruise ship off Mumbai coast recently, with one of them being the brother-in-law of a “high-profile” BJP leader.Targeting NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede, NCP spokesperson and Maharashtra Minister Nawab Malik also raised questions over the conduct of the agency officials.Also read: How were the drugs taken to the ship in Mumbai? The curious case of NCB cruise bustRaid on cruise ship ‘fake’, no drugs found: Maharashtra ministerRave party raid: Were BJP leader Manish Bhanushali, 'private detective' Kiran Gosavi involved in NCB operation on Sunday?The BJP, however, hit back saying that the ruling NCP’s claims against the NCB were “baseless”, and added that Malik “vents out” his anger against the agency due to his personal reasons.Malik alleged, “After the raid, NCB officer Sameer Wankhede said 8-10 people were held. How can an official who conducts an entire operation give an indefinite answer? If 10 people were held, then why were two people let off? And of the two, one was brother-in-law of a high-profile BJP leader.” The allegations by the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) against the NCB, a central agency, comes a day after the I-T Department raided the premises of commercial entities linked to its party leader and state Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.Editorial: Catch the big fish: Disproportionate attention to cruise case, not Mundra haulMalik said he would address a press conference on Saturday to reveal the name of the BJP leader whose brother-in-law was let off by the NCB.He said the motive behind the I-T Department’s raids on entities linked to Pawar was to malign him.On Wednesday, Malik had dubbed the NCB’s October 2 raid on the cruise ship as “fake” and alleged that no narcotic drugs were found during it.The NCB has so far arrested 18 people, including Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, after allegedly seizing drugs from the Goa-bound ship.Notably, Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan had been arrested by the NCB on January 13 this year in an alleged drugs case. He had got bail in September.Reacting to Malik’s allegations, BJP leader Pravin Darekar asserted that the NCP’s claims against the NCB were “baseless”.Darekar, who is the Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council, said it was improper to raise doubts against the agencies like the NCB, which is involved in curbing the menace of drugs.“He (Malik) is making only political statements. The claims made by Malik are baseless. If he has any proof, then he should give inputs to the investigating agency,” he said.“Nawab Malik and NCB’s relation is well-known. I don’t want to talk about his son-in-law. Whenever he (Malik) gets a chance, he tries to vent out his anger against the NCB. The NCB has very clearly clarified its stand,” the BJP leader added.The NCP shares power with the Shiv Sena and the Congress in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state, while the BJP sits in the opposition.

"The artisans have been given advanced tools and attractive packaging of their products has been ensured, and an agreement signed with e-commerce majors Flipkart and Amazon so that they can be marketed globally." He said the financial problems of artisans were being addressed by connecting them with banks.ACS Navneet Sehgal expressed the hope that as brand ambassador, Kangana Ranaut would take ODOP "to new heights and these products would eventually become the choice of people".Kangana responded by saying that she would gift ODOP products to members of her family and friends during Diwali this year. She was of the view that consumer aspirations should be addressed through her advertisements promoting ODOP products."We had a good discussion," the minister said. "I briefed her about the micro and small industries that are coming up and shaping the state's rural economy. She said she wanted to begin shooting to promote the scheme as quickly as possible," he added."There are products in UP that one cannot usually find elsewhere, such as the 'Kala Namak' rice variety," the minister said.

08-10-2021||United Nations/Geneva||High Covid rate in 0-19 age group in India; frequent post-jab infections with Delta variant: Study||A cross-sectional study conducted in India among Covid cases has found an increased number of infections among the younger age group of 0-19 years and women, higher mortality rate and more frequent incidences of post-vaccination infections with Delta variant as compared to a non-Variant of Concern lineage.The Covid Weekly Epidemiological Update, released by the World Health Organisation (WHO) this week, said a cross-sectional study, which is not yet peer reviewed, focused on demographic characteristics, including severity of the illness and mortality rate.It was conducted in India among Covid cases caused by the non-Variant Of Concern (B.1) variant and the Delta variant (B.1.617.2).“Using viral genomic sequences from 9,500 Covid patients, the study found an increased number of infections among younger age groups (0-19 years) and women, a lower mean age for infection and symptomatic illness/hospitalisation, higher mortality and more frequent incidences of post-vaccination infections with Delta variant compared to the non-VOC (B.1) variant,” the WHO update said.The update said that globally, the number of weekly Covid cases and deaths continued to decline, a trend that has been observed since August.Over 3.1 million new cases and just over 54,000 new deaths were reported during the week of September 27 to October 3, 2021.The cumulative number of confirmed cases reported globally is now over 234 million and the cumulative number of deaths is just under 4.8 million.Cases this week decreased by 9 per cent as compared to the previous week, while the number of deaths remained similar to that of the past week.All regions reported a decline in the number of new cases this week apart from the European Region.The largest decrease in new weekly cases was reported from the African Region (43 per cent), followed by the Eastern Mediterranean Region (21 per cent), the South-East Asia Region (19 per cent), the Region of the Americas (12 per cent) and the Western Pacific (12 per cent).The update said that the number of new weekly deaths reported showed an over 10 per cent decline for all regions except for the Regions of the Americas and Europe.The largest decline in weekly deaths was reported from the African Region, with a 25 per cent decline as compared to the previous week.Globally, cases of the Alpha variant have been reported in 195 countries, territories or areas, while 145 countries have reported cases of the Beta variant; and 99 countries have reported cases of the Gamma variant.The Delta variant has been reported in 192 countries (seven new countries since last week) across all six WHO regions as of October 5.

08-10-2021||New Delhi||How were the drugs taken to the ship in Mumbai? The curious case of NCB cruise bust||The high-profile Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) bust in the financial capital of the country has left a series of difficult conundrums for the public to understand, further deepening the mystery.The NCB has so far arrested around 18 people in the drugs case, including, Bollywood megastar Shah Rukh Khan's son -- Aryan Khan who has been sent to 14 days of judicial custody.Editorial: Catch the big fish: Disproportionate attention to cruise case, not Mundra haulBut even as the case is progressing further, there are some layers, when unearthed, raise eyebrows. The first thing, which comes into our mind is how was the contraband taken to the luxury ship?The NCB had said that during the raid, it recovered various popular party drugs like cocaine, MDMA, ecstasy, mephedrone and charas. Of all the contraband, the cocaine was 13 grams, charas 21 grams, 22 pills of MDMA and five grams MD. It is yet 'unanswered' as to how the starkids were able to procure these drugs.Also read:Raid on cruise ship ‘fake’, no drugs found: Maharashtra ministerRave party raid: Were BJP leader Manish Bhanushali, 'private detective' Kiran Gosavi involved in NCB operation on Sunday?Shah Rukh Khan fans say 'we are with you Aryan Khan' as they change Twitter DPs to this viral photoThe NCB's swoop, which shook the Bollywood's core as the future potential superstar-kid of the one of the reigning actors was involved, almost sounded unbelievable till a picture of a dazed Aryan sitting on a bench inside the agency's office in south Mumbai emerged from nowhere.A bald man, who was later identified as an alleged Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kiran Gosavi, clicked a picture with the starkid on the ship deck triggering a row that BJP activists were involved in the October 2 raid conducted by the NCB on the luxury ship Cordelia Cruise.Another BJP leader Manish Bhanushali was seen hauling out some of the accused, including Aryan and Arbaaz Merchant. How did a private person who is a BJP activist hand over the accused? -- another unanswered question.Of the eight people that were the first detained by the NCB, three -- Mohak Jaswal, Nupur Sarika and Gomit Chopra are from Delhi. Mohak and Nupur are both fashion designers, while Gomit is a hair stylist. Sources earlier confirmed to IANS that both Mohak and Nupur had come to Delhi with Gomit but still there is no further details about them. Did they go to Mumbai to attend the party or were they already residing there? It is yet to be answered.It is being said that the luxury ship, the Cordelia Cruises, which was raided by the sleuths of NCB when it was preparing to lift anchor for a fun-filled two-night gala voyage to Goa, had around 1,300 affluent passengers on board. Were only eight of these 1,300 people, consuming or carrying drugs with them? Is NCB going to question the remaining voyagers....?Coming back to the centre of attraction of this drug-bust, Aryan Khan, due to which this case became a high-profile case. The NCB had clearly stated that drugs were not recovered from the possession of the megastar's lad, while only six grams of charas was found in the possession of Arbaaz Merchant.If the quantity was so low, why was the NCB demanding another four days of his custody?Aryan's lawyer Satish Maneshinde, too, fired several questions at the drug probe agency, as the NCB said it needed custody extension so they could confront him with other accused.On Wednesday, the NCB arrested Achit Kumar whose name popped up from WhatsApp chats."Why did the NCB not confront Aryan and Arbaaz with Achit yesterday only? NCB is well equipped, they have more than 100 officers," the lawyer asked posing another question that was not answered."Confrontation cannot be grounds for custody," he quipped.Last but not the least, two days ago, the NCB made four more arrests in connection with the case.All the four arrested were employees of Namas'cray, a Delhi-based event management company that organised the 'rave party' onboard Cordelia Cruises' Empress ship.But wait, why are we forgetting that the Covid-19 pandemic is still ravaging the country. The country is still witnessing nearly 300 fatalities every day. Then how come under pandemic-induced restrictions, such a party was allowed. Another unanswered question!  IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/how-were-the-drugs-taken-to-the-ship-in-mumbai-the-curious-case-of-ncb-cruise-bust-321860

Gurnah, who recently retired as a professor of post-colonial literatures at the University of Kent, got the call from the Swedish Academy in the kitchen of his home in southeast England — and initially thought it was a prank.He said he was “surprised and humbled” by the award. Gurnah said the themes of migration and displacement that he explored “are things that are with us every day”— even more now than when he came to Britain in the 1960s.“People are dying, people are being hurt around the world. We must deal with these issues in the most kind way,” he said.He said he “stumbled into” writing after arriving in England as a way of exploring both the loss and liberation of the emigrant experience. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tanzanian-wins-nobel-in-litt-for-cross-culture-work-321634

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had discussed the matter with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of a meeting, Bagchi said. “We (India and China) can work together to disengage in the remaining areas. In some areas of the LAC, disengagement has been done,” he said. On Afghan nationals who are stuck in India post the Taliban takeover, he said, “All of them are getting their visa renewed automatically.”On US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman expressing “unease” over New Delhi’s procurement of S 400 Russian missile system, Bagchi said discussions were going on with the US on the matter. Meanwhile, the extradition of Peter Kim Davy, one of the accused in the Purulia arms drop case of 1995, is on the agenda with Denmark.

Taking a strong stand on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, Varun had posted messages demanding strict and time-bound action. In a tweet on Wednesday, what he called a “crystal clear” version of the Lakhimpur violence, Varun said, “Protesters cannot be silenced through murder. There has to be accountability for the innocent blood of farmers.” He had also written to CM Yogi Adityanath, asking for a CBI probe and Rs 1 crore compensation for victims’ families.Others dropped from the panel include former Union minister Chaudhary Birender Singh, who too is believed to be disgruntled over the farmers’ issues, Ambala MP Rattan Lal Kataria, Chandigarh MP Kirron Kher, firebrand Hindutva leader Vinay Katiyar, Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy and old-timers like CP Thakur, Vijay Goel, Suresh Prabhu and Arti Mehra.Party leaders claim more than 30-40 per cent of the names are changed every time a new executive is formed. Some are bound to be dropped to make way for new faces. The party has expanded in West Bengal, therefore new leaders from the state had to be included, they say.The executive is a key deliberative body of the party which meets to discuss important issues and shapes the organisation’s agenda. The disruption caused by the pandemic has prevented its meeting for a while now. The last meeting was in January 2019. Sources claim a meeting could be held early next month.Those inducted into the new executive include Jyotiraditya Scindia, S Jaishankar, Meenakshi Lekhi, Anurag Singh Thakur, Hardeep Puri, Som Prakash, Bhupender Yadav, Krishan Pal Gurjar, Sunita Duggal, Mithun Chakraborty and Swapan Dasgupta.Other prominent exitsBirender Singh, Subramanian Swamy, Rattan Lal Kataria, Kirron Kher, Vinay KatiyarEntrants from region||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/day-after-lakhimpur-tweets-bjp-drops-varun-maneka-from-national-executive-321579

We are prepared,” says a distraught Ram Dulare Kashyap as the Uttar Pradesh Police on Thursday summoned the prime accused in the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence that killed eight, including Kashyap’s son Raman.Also read:UP violence: 2 arrested; SC seeks status report on accused in 24 hrsWhy are you silent on Lakhimpur incident, Kapil Sibal asks PM ModiPriyanka Gandhi asks PM Modi to see video clip showing SUV mowing down farmersAnother video from Lakhimpur Kheri shows minister's vehicle mowing down farmers at great speedNot too enthused with the news of police summons to Ashish Mishra, accused of mowing down protesters, Dulare said his hope for justice was pinned on the Supreme Court, which has taken cognisance of the deadly incident. Much like Kashyap, the kin of other victims of the Sunday violence, including Nachatar Singh and Lovepreet Singh, fear lack of justice in the matter.The UP Government’s move today to constitute a single-member judicial commission under Pradeep Kumar Srivastava, a retired judge of the Allahabad High Court, has also not inspired confidence among the affected families or the local inhabitants who have set their eyes on the apex court and its next moves.“The Supreme Court has come to our rescue. It is only after the SC intervention that the local police have summoned the accused. He may well have absconded already. It has been four days since my brother passed away and there have been no arrests let alone questioning. We are still hearing only of summons. What can we say of the future? We are between hope and despair,” rues Amanpreet Kaur, sister of deceased farmer Lovepreet Singh, whose mother continues to be on saline drip unable to bear the shock of her son’s sudden death.Even though Lucknow range IG Lakshmi Singh today said summons had been issued to Ashish Mishra, and two more (Ashish Pandey and Luv Kush) were being interrogated for leads, the level of confidence in the police inquiry and state action remains low.Editorial: Mowing down protest: If video clip is genuine, Centre should act now“No inquiry can help unless the Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra resigns. He controls the police. How will the cops do justice in a case involving his son? We have not yet forgotten the 2003 murder case against Ajay Mishra, who was acquitted in 2004 with the appeal against the acquittal pending in Allahabad High Court. Prabhat Gupta was too young to die,” says Chandra Mohan Mourya, a local teacher who lives in Tikonia just some distance away from where the vehicles belonging to Mishra and his son allegedly rammed into agitating people killing four.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-kin-look-to-top-court-little-faith-in-uttar-pradesh-police-321577

Angry farmers then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles.The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver.Farmers claimed that Ashish Mishra was in one of the vehicles, an allegation denied by him and his father who say they can produce evidence to prove he was at an event at that time.Police said they have formed a nine-member team headed by Deputy Inspector General (Headquarters) Upendra Agarwal to investigate into the FIR lodged against the minister’s son and the others.The arrests came on a day when the Supreme Court termed the Lakhimpur Kheri incident “unfortunate” and sought a status report by Friday from the Uttar Pradesh police.The court specifically asked the UP Police to specify whether the accused named in the FIR have been arrested. Within hours, the UP Police announced the arrests.A notice has been pasted at the Union Minister’s house in Lakhimpur city under Section 160 of the CrPC, seeking the presence of his son at the police lines in Lakhimpur to present any oral, written or digital evidence.According to police, the investigations so far had named an accused and mentioned six unnamed accused.Three of them had died at the spot.
