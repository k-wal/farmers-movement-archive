The first phase comprised combat conditioning and tactical training by both the contingents.“Training received by both contingents in the first phase was put into practice in the validation stage. Both contingents jointly took part in the validation exercise which comprised combat shooting, rappelling and helicopter-based mobilisation of quick response teams,” the statement said.The troops were organised into composite companies with mixed platoons of Indian and US armies and the validation exercise culminated in a raid on an enemy position in mountainous terrain and securing of critical infrastructure, it said.The joint training exercise was named ‘Ex Yudh Abhyas 2021’.The Indo-US defence ties have been on an upswing in the last few years. In June 2016, the US had designated India a ‘Major Defence Partner’.The two countries have also signed key defence and security pacts over the past few years, including the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2016 that allows their militaries to use each other’s bases for repair and replenishment of supplies as well as provides for deeper cooperation.The two sides also signed COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement) in 2018 that provides for interoperability between the two militaries and provides for the sale of high-end technology from the US to India.In October last year, India and the US sealed the BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) agreement to further boost bilateral defence ties.The pact provides for sharing of high-end military technology, logistics and geospatial maps between the two countries.

30-10-2021||New Delhi||Moderate to high turnout in bypolls to 29 assembly and 3 Lok Sabha seats||A turnout of 50 per cent to over 73 per cent was recorded on Saturday in bypolls to three Lok Sabha seats and 29 assembly seats spread across 13 states, with INLD leader Abhay Chautala, who quit the Haryana assembly in protest against the agri laws, and Congress' Pratibha Singh, wife of late chief minister Virbhadra Singh, among the prominent candidates in the fray.The polling passed off peacefully and it was ensured that all Covid-19 safety measures were followed, officials said.In Himachal Pradesh, Mandi Lok Sabha seat from where Pratibha Singh is contesting saw a relatively lower turnout of 49.83 per cent till 5 pm. She was pitted against BJP's Khushal Singh Thakur, a Kargil war hero who is trying his luck at the hustings for the first time.The Mandi seat fell vacant after the death of Ramswaroop Sharma (BJP) in March.The first voter of independent India, 104-year-old Shyam Saran Negi, cast his vote at the model polling station of Kalpa in Kinnaur district.The polling percentage in the three assembly seats - Fatehpur, Arki and Jubbal-Kotkhai - was 62.4 percent, 61.33 per cent and 66.1 percent respectively till 5 pm.The byelections in Himachal Pradesh are crucial as assembly polls are due in the state early next year.Besides the three assembly seats in HP, bypolls were held in five assembly seats in Assam, four in West Bengal, three each in Madhya Pradesh and Meghalaya, two each in Bihar, Karnataka and Rajasthan and one seat each in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Mizoram and Telangana.Out of these, the BJP was holding around half a dozen seats, the Congress had nine, while the rest were with the regional parties.The counting of votes will take place on November 2.Over 73 per cent voter turnout was recorded till 5 pm in the bypolls to the Ellenabad Assembly constituency in Haryana, necessitated by the resignation of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Abhay Singh Chautala as MLA in protest against the Centre's new farm laws.Chautala, son of INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala, is contesting against Congress nominee Pawan Beniwal and BJP-JP candidate Gobind Kanda, the brother of Haryana Lokhit Party chief and legislator Gopal Kanda.It is an important contest for the Chautalas as Abhay had won the 2010 bypolls from Ellenabad, when Om Prakash Chautala vacated the seat, and then retained it in 2014 and also in 2019 Assembly polls, when he was the lone INLD MLA in the House.Dadra and Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha seat saw 67 percent polling by 5 pm, Election Commission officials said.The byelection in the constituency which is part of the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu was necessitated due to the death of seven-time independent MP Mohan Delkar whose wife Kalaben Delkar is contesting as Shiv Sena candidate against BJP's Mahesh Gavit and Congress' Mahesh Dhodi.Khandwa Lok Sabha seat in Madhya Pradesh, whose MP Nand Kumar Singh Chauhan of the BJP had died, witnessed a turnout of 63.88 per cent, while an estimated 64.60 per cent voting was recorded in the three Assembly seats.In Assam, 69.60 percent was reported in five assembly constituencies of Gossaigaon, Bhabanipur, Tamulpur, Mariani and Thowra seats till 5 pm.The ruling BJP has fielded candidates in three seats leaving the other two to alliance partner UPPL. The Congress put up nominees in all five, while its former allies, the AIUDF and the BPF, are contesting in two and one seats respectively.A high voter turnout of nearly 71 percent was recorded till 5 pm in West Bengal's four assembly constituencies. The BJP and TMC held two seats each.Barring a few stray incidents, polling, which began at 7 am, passed off peacefully in all four constituencies, an Election Commission official said.Scuffles between TMC and BJP supporters were reported outside a booth in Khardah and security personnel used batons to disperse the crowd.Kajal Sinha's death due to COVID-19 necessitated the bypoll in Khardah.According to TMC members, Sinha's son Arjodeep was injured in the melee and had to be hospitalised.In Dinhata, TMC heavyweight Udayan Guha is looking to reclaim the seat, which the BJP had snatched from him in the April elections.The by-election was necessitated following the resignation of Nisith Pramanik, now Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, as he chose to retain his Lok Sabha membership.In Santipur, BJP MP Jagannath Sarkar resigned from the assembly, thus calling for a bypolls.Bypolls to Dinhata and Santipur are seen as a prestige battle for the BJP, which is currently grappling with an exodus of MLAs and senior leaders.In Bihar, an estimated 49.60 per cent voting was recorded in the two assembly constituencies of Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur which were held by the JD(U).An average of 65 per cent voter turnout was recorded in the bypolls to Dhariawad and Vallabhnagar assembly constituencies of Rajasthan till 5 pm.The bypolls were necessitated due to the demise of Congress MLA from Vallabhnagar Gajendra Singh Shaktawat and BJP legislator from Dhariawad Gautam Lal Meena.In Vallabhnagar, the ruling Congress party has given a ticket to Gajendra Shaktawat's wife, Preeti Shaktawat, while the BJP has fielded Himmat Singh Jhala.The Congress has fielded Nagraj Meena in Dhariawad against BJP candidate Khet Singh Meena.Though the number of constituencies going to bypolls is not crucial from the viewpoint of the government's stability, the results will send a message across the state about the performance of the Congress-led government, which had faced a major threat last year due to rebellion of the then deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 MLAs led by him.An estimated 56.78 per cent voter turnout was recorded in the bypolls to Sindgi and Hangal assembly constituencies in Karnataka.The by-elections have been necessitated following the death of Sindgi JD(S) legislator M C Managuli and BJP's C M Udasi from Hangal and will be the first electoral test for Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who had replaced B S Yediyurappa.While Ramesh Bhusanur, who came second behind Managuli in the 2018 polls, is the BJP candidate from Sindgi, Shivaraj Sajjanar is its candidate from Hangal constituency.The Congress has named M C Managuli's son Ashok Managuli, who has joined the party, as its candidate from Sindgi, while former MLC Srinivas Mane is its candidate from Hangal.The JD(S), which was the first to announce its candidates, has fielded 33-year-old Naziya Shakeel Ahmed Angadi from Sindgi and 35-year-old B.E, M.Tech graduate Niyaz Shaikh from Hangal.In Telangana, byelection was held in the Huzurabad assembly constituency with the ruling TRS, opposition BJP and Congress locked in a triangular contest.The by-election has been necessitated in view of the resignation of Eatala Rajender in June following his removal from the state Cabinet over allegations of land grabbing. Rajender, who dismissed the allegations, had quit the TRS and is contesting on a BJP ticket.The byelection is seen as a do-or-die battle for Rajender, while it is significant for the BJP as it aims at emerging as the alternative to ruling TRS in the 2023 Legislative Assembly elections.Though byelection was also announced for the Shamator-Chessore assembly constituency in Nagaland, Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party candidate S Keoshu Yimchunger was declared elected uncontested on October 13.Bypolls were also be held in Andhra Pradesh's Badvel seat, earlier held by YSRC .Meghalaya's Rajabala, Mawryngkneng and Mawphlang seats recorded a voting percentage of over 64 per cent.Former national footballer Eugeneson Lyngdoh is contesting the election from Mawphlang on a United Democratic Party (UDP) ticket.

30-10-2021||Guwahati||Blast on Assam-Mizoram border, one policeman held||Fresh tension brewed between Assam and Mizoram along the inter-state border in Hailakandi district after a blast near a police outpost and arrest of a Mizoram policeman for his alleged involvement in it, a senior official said on Saturday.The "low-intensity blast" took place near the Baicherra forward outpost of Assam Police at around 1:30 am on Friday, Hailakandi Superintendent of Police Gaurav Upadhyay told PTI.The incident occurred around three months after a clash between police forces of the two northeastern neighbours in a disputed border area in Cachar district left seven people including six Assam policemen dead."Our outpost was on a hillock and the blast took place just below it. After the explosion, we immediately cordoned off the area with the help of neutral central forces and started an investigation," the Hailakandi SP said.On Friday morning, an Indian Reserve Battalion (IRBn) personnel of Mizoram Police was found loitering in the area and he could not explain his presence there, Upadhyay said."We picked him up and during interrogation, we found his involvement in the blast. We arrested him yesterday and produced him in a court, which sent him to judicial custody," he added.The blast took place just two days after Assam Police objected to the construction of a bridge at Kachurthal area on the Assam side that was abandoned after a confrontation erupted over it in August."After our objection and at the Centre's intervention, Mizoram had stopped construction of the bridge. But on October 26, they again started working on it. When we objected, they left the place without taking their equipment," Upadhyay said.On August 20, a few workers from Mizoram were trying to build a bridge at Kachurthal under Ramnathpur police station. Around 40-50 security personnel from Mizoram reached the site when Assam Police had objected to the construction.Two days later, in order to assert the position of Assam and to ask Mizoram forces to retreat from the Assam side of the bridge, a party of around 200 Assam Police personnel and commandos under Upadhyay's leadership had reached Kachurthal and the issue was settled."Today, the Mizoram administration came to the bridge site and dismantled the construction that they had started. They also took away all their equipment and machinery," the SP said.A clash between police forces of Assam and Mizoram on the disputed border area in Cachar district on July 26 left seven people—six Assam Police personnel and a civilian—dead and over 50 others injured.The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)  issued notices to the Centre, Assam, and Mizoram on August 22 over the deadly border clash between the two northeastern states in July, stating that "grave violation of human rights" took place.Assam's Barak Valley districts of Cachar, Karimganj, and Hailakandi share a 164.6 km long border with Mizoram's three districts of Aizawl, Kolasib and Mamit.The long-standing dispute has its origin in a notification of 1875 issued during the British era that differentiated Lushai Hills from the plains of Cachar, and another of 1933 that demarcates a boundary between Lushai Hills and Manipur.Mizoram insists the inter-state boundary should be demarcated on the basis of the 1875 notification, a corollary to the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation (BEFR) Act, 1873.Mizoram leaders have, however, been arguing against the demarcation notified of 1933, claiming that the Mizo society was not consulted, while Assam wants that notification to be enforced. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/blast-on-assam-mizoram-border-one-policeman-held-332061

30-10-2021||Mumbai||Court refuses to stay production warrant against Sachin Waze in extortion case||A magistrate on Saturday refused to stay a production warrant issued against dismissed police officer Sachin Waze in an extortion case, citing that the accused cannot approach the court directly with a plea saying he should not be produced before the court.The special NIA court had on Friday allowed the Mumbai Police to take custody of Waze for interrogation in connection with an extortion case registered at Goregaon police station.The special court had directed the prison authorities to hand over Waze’s custody to the crime branch on November 1 and has further instructed the prison to take back Waze’s custody after he is produced before the magistrate court.Waze’s lawyer Raunak Naik approached the magistrate court on Saturday, seeking a stay on the production warrant it had issued.The accused in his plea claimed that he has not fully recovered post his complex heart surgery in September, and has been advised to follow certain dos and don’ts.Appearing for the Mumbai police, advocate Shekhar Jagtap vehemently objected to the application on the ground that there is no provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to stay a production warrant.After hearing both sides, additional chief metropolitan magistrate S B Bhajipale found that the application was not maintainable and rejected it.    As per provisions in the CrPC, the officer in charge of prison may abstain from carrying out the production warrant on the ground of reason of sickness or infirmity of the person, unfit to be removed from the prison, the court said.However, the court noted that the jail authorities had not intimated it about such a situation.“The accused cannot claim directly by approaching before this court that he should not be produced before the court,” the magistrate said.It further said that the investigating officer is authorised to make a decision regarding the place of interrogation of the accused.“Considering the facts and circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that the present application is not maintainable, hence rejected.”  Waze, an accused in the Antilia bomb scare case and in the murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran, is currently in judicial custody, and lodged in Taloja jail. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/court-refuses-to-stay-production-warrant-against-sachin-waze-in-extortion-case-332057

Small banners were hung on various electric poles, one such poster depicting a smiling Puneeth with s pigeon perched on his shoulder.His admirers also mounted posters at the entrance of Cauvery Theatre in Sadashivanagar, shopfront of a wood and metal furniture agency, and boundary walls and fences of various public buildings in Bengaluru.The mood was mirrored in heritage city of Mysuru with the royal family and commoners both paying tributes to the actor in their own ways.A huge framed poster was mounted near Hardinge Circle in the heart of Mysuru, while a smaller one was pasted on a security barricade in a market zone right outside the premises of the centuries-old Chamundeshwari Temple, revered as the presiding deity of the city.Almost all the posters had a white garland made of mogra flowers.A digital billboard on a street near an educational institution in Mysuru also displayed condolence messages along with the actor’s photograph.Poster paying homage to the actor were also seen mounted at several public places in Ramnagra—where Bollywood cult film ‘Sholay’ was also shot—toy town Chennapatna, and various places in Mandya on the road route between Bengaluru and Mysuru.Puneeth Rajkumar’s untimely demise shocked the Kannada and the film fraternity at large and drew condolences from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Union Culture Minister G Kishan Reddy, among others.Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, the current scion of the Mysore royal family, also expressed his condolences in a statement issued on his official social media platforms, and prayed for the actor’s “soul to attain peace and tranquility”.Soon after the news came out that the actor suffered a heart attack, scores of anxious fans started gathering around Vikram Hospital, where he later died at 2.30 pm despite best efforts by doctors to save him.On Friday, the mood was sombre in Mysuru as people struggled to come to terms with the sudden death of the superstar.“Everyone is feeling low due to his death. He was a superstar. His father was a legendary film icon, and both were greatly admired by generations of fans,” said Ganesh K, who works at Hotel Mayura Hoysala in Mysuru, run by the Karanataka State Tourism Development Corporation.After midnight, many of the fans took to the streets as their chants of ‘Appu love you’ in Kannada broke the silence of the night.Around 1 am, a group of youths assembled near the Mayura Hoysala located on Jhansi Laxmibai Road near the Mysuru Railway Station and raised the chants of ‘Appu, Appu’.While some fans chose to play at full blast hit songs from the actor’s films inside their cars as they drove around the city, thumping their fists out of the windows and raising slogans in chorus. Puneeth Rajkumar fast outgrew his father’s shadow to carve a place of his own in the Kannada showbiz industry.He was adored by his fans and gave a series of hits starting with “Appu”, which later became his nickname following the success of the film. Many of his fans also call him ‘Power Star’.After a stint as a child actor, the Kannada film star had made his debut as a leading man in the 2002 movie “Appu” and followed it up with a string of successful films, including ‘Abhi’, ‘Maurya’, ‘Ajay’ and ‘Arasu’.He was also a popular celebrity host on television.

I heard he had donated his eyes, such a good human being. We really enjoy serving our guests, but today the enthusiasm is running low,” said a senior employee of a leading luxury heritage hotel in Mysuru. Puneeth Rajkumar’s body will be kept at the Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru for the public to pay their last respects, state minister R Ashoka told reporters on Friday. He said the actor’s last rites will be performed with full state honours and the family will decide when it will happen. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/posters-in-streets-chants-of-appu-in-air-as-mysuru-bengaluru-mourn-puneeth-rajkumars-death-332051
30-10-2021||Satya Prakash||Karnataka government takes U-turn on deportation of Rohingyas||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 30Having told the Supreme Court that it had no immediate plan to deport Rohingyas living in Bengaluru, the BJP Government in Karnataka has taken a U-turn on the contentious issue.In a fresh affidavit filed in the top court, the Karnataka Government – which had earlier opposed Delhi BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay’s petition seeking deportation of illegal Rohingya immigrants – dropped the controversial part of its September 20 affidavit which said there was no immediate plan to deport them.The latest affidavit dated October 26 also omitted certain other portions its earlier “statement of objection” filed before the top court that had sought dismissal of Upadhyay’s PIL “in the interest of justice”, terming the grounds raised by him as “self-serving” and “untenable in law”.Now it has said that 126 Rohingyas living in Karnataka had been identified and that they were not living in any camp/detention centre. “… whatever the order that would be passed by this court will be scrupulously adhered to and followed in its letter and spirit,” it said.The latest affidavit of the Karnataka Government was silent on the reasons for the sudden change in its stand on the issue of illegal Rohingya immigrants. However, it was clear that the earlier affidavit went against the categorical stand taken by the Centre which said they were a security threat to the country and had no fundamental right to stay in India.Amid raging controversy over Rohingya infiltrators allegedly getting settled in various parts of the country, the BJP Government in Karnataka has opposed before the Supreme Court Upadhyay’s PIL seeking directions to “identify, detain and deport all illegal immigrants and infiltrators, including Bangladeshis and Rohingyas within one year”.The Karnataka Government had earlier said it had no immediate plan to deport 72 Rohingyas living in Bengaluru. “The Bengaluru City Police have not housed Rohingyas in any camp or detention centre within its jurisdiction. However, 72 Rohingyas identified in Bengaluru city are working in various fields and Bengaluru City Police have not taken any coercive action against them,” it had said.The top court had in March this year issued notice on Upadhyay’s PIL seeking directions to the Centre and states to detect, detain and deport all illegal immigrants within a year. He also wanted the top court to direct the Central and states to declare creating forged or fabricated PAN, Aadhaar numbers, Passports, Ration and voter cards and other such documents a non bailable and non-compoundable offence.Alleging large-scale entry of illegal immigrants, particularly from Myanmar and Bangladesh, Upadhyay had in his PIL filed in 2017 contended that it not only threatened the demographic structure of bordering districts but also seriously impaired national security.“Demographic composition in the country, particularly the bordering districts has altered with illegal immigration from Myanmar and Bangladesh. The bordering districts of Assam, West Bengal Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura have recorded growth of population higher than the national average. Illegal immigrants have been using West Bengal as a corridor to migrate to other parts,” he had submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-government-takes-u-turn-on-deportation-of-rohingyas-332050

30-10-2021||Vibha Sharma||Give another opportunity to Modi-Dhami team to ‘bring prosperity to every home’: Shah in Uttarakhand||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 30After Uttar Pradesh, Home Minister Amit Shah today landed in poll-bound Uttarakhand seeking another term for the BJP under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami “to bring prosperity to every home” in the state.Launching the party’s poll campaign, Shah said Uttarakhand has “taken big strides in development due to the vision of Prime Minister Modi”.Speaking of road and rail infrastructure development projects during the BJP rule, he slammed the opposition Congress for “not doing much” for the state during the 10 years it ruled. “What did it (Congress) do for Uttarakhand during this period? It should tell the people of the state,” he said, adding that it was the PM’s vision for the reconstruction of Kedarnath (which suffered extensive damage in 2013) that led to unprecedented development in and around the temple.Shah credited former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee for creation of the state and asked the people to give another opportunity to the Modi-Dhami team to bring prosperity to every home.Warning that a wrong decision could lead to a “corrupt government” coming to power, he reminded former chief minister Harish Rawat of the sting video showing him negotiating a deal to buy support of rebel MLAs and the ‘Dennis liquor scam’ during his tenure. Claiming that the Congress believes in “appeasement”, Shah also recalled how “Muslims were allowed to offer namaz in the middle of highways on Fridays” during its rule.Praising Dhami for the urgency with which he responded to the recent floods in Uttarakhand, Shah said he hardly left any scope for the Centre to do anything. The senior BJP leader also launched schemes for the poll-bound state, including the Chief Minister Ghasyari Kalyan Yojana which will help women from travelling long distances to fetch fodder.Elections to the 70-member Uttarakhand Assembly are scheduled early 2022.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/give-another-opportunity-to-modi-dhami-team-to-bring-prosperity-to-every-home-shah-in-uttarakhand-332046

I immediately closed the bonnet and contacted the Wildlife SOS on their 24-hour helpline."A three-member team from Wildlife SOS promptly arrived at the location with all the necessary rescue equipment.As a large crowd had also gathered around the car to get a glimpse of the python, the rescuers implemented crowd control measures, before extricating the snake.Wildlife SOS CEO and co-founder Kartick Satyanarayan, said: "Due to the large size of pythons, their rescue operations can be a formidable task. Our team is meticulously trained in handling such sensitive operations while ensuring the safety of public and the animal."Director Conservation Projects, Baiju Raj M.V. said: "The Indian Rock Python is native to the tropical regions in the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia. These reptiles are often mistaken to be venomous snakes due to their appearance.

30-10-2021||Lucknow||BJP MLA and 6 BSP legislators join SP in UP; Akhilesh taunts ruling party||Seven MLAs — one from the BJP and six suspended from the BSP — joined the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday in the presence of Akhilesh Yadav, who hit out at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and also claimed the BJP and the Congress “are the same”.“The people of the state are so agitated that the BJP will be wiped out in the coming days and Bhajpa pariwar (BJP family) will appear as Bhaagta Pariwar (runaway family),” the SP chief said here while taunting the ruling party over its MLA Rakesh Rathore’s desertion and indicating that some others from the BJP were also in touch with him in the poll-bound state.Those who joined the SP include BJP MLA from Sitapur Rakesh Rathore and BSP rebels Aslam Raini (Shrawati), Sushma Patel (Madiyahon), Aslam Ali (Hapur), Hakim Lal Bind (Handia), Mujtaba Siddiqui (Phoolpur) and Hargovind Bhargava (Sidhauli). The seven MLAs expressed their resolve to make Akhilesh the Chief Minister again in the coming Assembly elections.Earlier this year, an audio clip purportedly of Rathore criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for asking people to clap and clang bells and plates during the Covid-19 pandemic had gone viral on social media and he was asked by the party leadership to explain his alleged anti-party activities.The BSP rebels who joined the SP were suspended by BSP president Mayawati after they had opposed the nomination of the party’s official candidate Ramji Gautam for the Rajya Sabha in October 2020. They had reportedly met Akhilesh Yadav earlier this year and had hinted that they may switch sides soon.Yadav also took a swipe at Union Home Minister Amit Shah for saying that 90 per cent works of the BJP manifesto have been completed and the 10 per cent remaining in the ‘lok kalyan sankalp patra’ will be taken up in the next few months.Yadav said it seems that the BJP leaders have not shuffled its pages and have forgotten about what all was there in their manifesto.“The first thing mentioned in it was for the farmers that a roadmap to double their income will be prepared by 2022 and they assured farmers in this regard from various platforms. I want to know what has happened to it,” he said reading out for the BJP’s 2017 manifesto and asked about the fate of other promises as well.He also again distanced himself from the party’s former ally Congress.“The opinion of Samajwadis for the Congress and BJP is that both are the same,” the SP chief said to a query.The SP chief also contested the claims of improved law and order and said the statistics of the Government of India and services like Dial 100 and 1090 will clear the picture about the cases of injustice against the girls.Recalling the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, he said a BJP minister was seen threatening the people in a video and said that this very minister is “being honoured on the dais with the Union Home Minister Amit Shah”.He also accused the BJP of ruining educational institutions by posting people of a particular ideology.Yadav alleged that instead of carrying out development works, the budget was being spent on publicity.Questioning the outcome of the investment meet held in Uttar Pradesh, he asked how many youths got jobs after the event.“Those who came here seeking jobs were chased away using canes and humiliated. Now, these youth will cast their votes to wipe out BJP,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-mla-and-6-bsp-legislators-join-sp-in-up-akhilesh-taunts-ruling-party-332017
30-10-2021||Agra||Agra lawyers refuse legal help to Kashmiri students booked for sedition||Several lawyers’ associations of Agra have decided to deny legal help to the three Kashmiri students of an engineering college here, who were charged with sedition.The students were booked under the Act that dates back to the British era allegedly for posting a WhatsApp status praising Pakistan players after the team’s victory against India in a T20 cricket match on October 24.“We will not provide any legal help to those who are involved in anti national activity or anti social activity,” Nitin Verma, President of the Young Lawyers’ Association, Agra, told PTI.“It will send a message to the country that the lawyers of Agra have decided not to provide legal help to anyone who is involved in anti-national activity,” he said.Verma argued that freedom of speech doesn’t allow engaging in “anti-national” activities and that he condemns the students’ praising of the Pakistan cricket team.“We will also oppose any lawyer who agrees to provide legal help to these students whenever he comes to Agra,” he added.Sunil Sharma, President of the Agra Advocates’ Association, echoed the same sentiment.“No organisation has the right to involve in anti-India activity. The decision of lawyers’ to not provide legal help would send the message to everyone in the country that no one should help those involved in anti-national activity,” Sharma said.Besides these two, Janpad Bar Association, Adhivakta Sehyog Samiti, and other similar bodies, too have issued similar dicta against the three Kashmiri students.Nasir Khuehami, national spokesperson of the Jammu and Kashmir Students’ Association, said the body will extend legal help to the students.“This is true that lawyers associations in Agra have refused to provide help to Kashmiri students and have said they won’t plead the case.“But the J&K Students Association has decided to support and extend them a helping hand as far as legal support is concerned,” he said.“We have got a lawyer now through our Delhi team and friends there. Advocate Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi will defend the students on behalf of the Association,” he added.Khuehami also expressed worry that sedition will ruin careers of these students.On Thursday, when the students were exiting the court, few right wing activists raised slogans against Pakistan in the court’s premises and chased the students.The Agra police escorted the students back into the police van.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agra-lawyers-refuse-legal-help-to-kashmiri-students-booked-for-sedition-332013
30-10-2021||New Delhi||PAEG flags acute shortage of funds under MGNREGA scheme||A group of activists has flagged an “acute shortage” of funds under the rural employment guarantee programme MGNREGA despite a pandemic-induced surge in demand for work, and said almost 90 per cent of the allocated budget has been used up with five months remaining of the financial year.The Rural Development Ministry on Saturday said the government is committed to release funds for wage and material payments for proper implementation of the programme and added that whenever additional fund is required, the Ministry of Finance is requested to provide it.Underlining that the Centre’s flagship rural employment guarantee programme is a lifeline for millions of rural poor, especially in times of the Covid-19 pandemic, the People’s Action for Employment Guarantee (PAEG) in a statement on Friday said the total budget for it in 2021-22 is 34 per cent less than that of the previous year.PAEG is a group of the activists who were earlier members of the Central Employment Guarantee Council, a statutory body under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA).In the Union Budget presented earlier this year, the government allocated Rs 73,000 crore to the scheme for financial year 2021-22. It was 34 per cent less than the 2020-21 revised estimate of Rs 1.11 lakh crore.In the previous financial year, the Centre had revised the allocation to Rs 1.11 lakh crore from an initial allocation of Rs 61,500 crore.PAEG working group member Nikhil Dey said the Covid-19 pandemic as well as the resultant lockdowns have had an unprecedented impact on workers across the country.“As a result during the first wave in 2020, millions of rural poor turned to MGNREGA in historically high numbers since it was the only source of a basic income security. A total of 7.75 crore households were provided work in the financial year 2020-21,” Dey said.However, the Centre in this fiscal reduced the fund allocation to MGNREGA despite the evident importance of it during the first wave and the devastating economic impact of the second wave.Sharing the details based on data from the NREGA Management Information System (MIS), Dey said, “Almost 90 per cent of the allocated budget for the year has been used up till now, with five months of the programme still remaining.”         “The remaining funds can cover at most 13 days of employment per household for the rest of the year,” he further said.Dey said 13 per cent of the total households that demanded employment did not get employment and only around two per cent completed 100 days of employment.In a statement on Saturday, the Ministry of Rural Development which is the nodal ministry for MGNREGA said the government is committed to release funds for wage and material payments for proper implementation of the scheme.“A total of more than six crore households have got wage employment during the current financial year against their demand.... Employment has been offered to 99.63 per cent of the total demand of wage employment and against the offer of employment, a total of 87.35 per cent of beneficiaries has turned up for work as per their will,” it said.Fund release towards wage and material is a continuous process, the ministry said, adding, “Currently Rs 8,921 crore funds are available which can meet the wage liability equal to this current availability.”                The Centre is committed to release funds for wage and material payments for proper implementation of the scheme as per the provisions of the Act and guidelines applicable for the central government as well as state governments.“Whenever additional fund is required, the Ministry of Finance is requested to provide the funds. In the previous financial year, the Ministry of Finance allocated Rs 50,000 crore additional funds for the scheme over and above that of BE (budget estimate),” it said.MGNREGA is a demand-driven employment scheme. Not less than 100 days of employment is provided to registered workers upon receipt of their demand.These workers are given job cards which are linked with their Aadhaar numbers and bank accounts.It provides supplementary means of livelihood to people in rural areas, primarily during lean periods.The Centre has also announced additional employment over and above 100 days per household to up to 150 days in notified drought-affected districts in various states of the country.Assets created under the programme include works related to natural resource management such as water conservation, land development and irrigation. Besides these, dams, irrigation channels, check dams, ponds, wells and anganwadis are also built under the scheme.

30-10-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav takes swipe at Amit Shah for sharing dais with Union Minister Ajay Mishra||Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday took a swipe at Union Home Minister Amit Shah for sharing a dais with his junior colleague Ajay Mishra, under a cloud over the recent violence in Lakhimpur Kheri in which eight people were killed.In a post on Twitter, Yadav also tagged a photograph of the two ministers during a programme of Uttar Pradesh’s ruling BJP here on Friday.“Jhoothi doorbeen lekar dhoondne ka dhong pura tha, jabki bagal mein chora jagat dhindora tha (the pretense of searching with false binoculars was complete, the person being searched was standing alongside),” the SP president posted. The reference was to Shah’s remark during his speech on Friday that no ‘bahubali’, as politicians with a criminal history or strongmen are often called, can be found even if you look for them with binoculars.Praising the law and order situation under the Yogi Adityanath Government, Shah had said, “Before 2017, seeing the bad condition of the law and order of Uttar Pradesh my blood would boil. In the era of the earlier government, girls could not come out of the house. There were two-three ‘bahubalis’ in every district but today, even if I look with binoculars, I do not see any ‘bahubali’ anywhere.”  On October 3, of the eight people killed in during the violence in Lakhimpuri Kheri, four were farmers. Union Minister of State for Home Mishra’s son Ashish has been arrested. Some farmers claimed that Ashish Mishra was in one of the vehicles that ran down the four farmers, an allegation denied by him and his father.Opposition parties, including the SP and the Congress, have demanded the dismissal of Ajay Mishra.

The Congress believes in uniting India’s people and taking them forward. For us, every single Indian has the right to be given the space that he requires,” he said addressing the gathering. Congress’s response to the hatred spread by BJP is love and affection, he said. “So, wherever they spread anger hatred and division, we spread love and affection,” he added. “I am not here to waste your time or my time. Just as your time is important, my time is also important. The commitment that we will make to you in manifesto is not just a commitment but a guarantee,” he added. Talking about the assurances made by the Congress, he said, “My credibility is important to me. Unlike many other leaders, when I say something here, I will make sure it happens.”  “If I come here I say to you that we will not allow coal hub and I don’t do it, next time I come here I will have no credibility,” he said in his address to the fishermen, who are opposing the project of double tracking of South Western Railway as they allege that it is an attempt to turn the state into a coal hub. Gandhi said that the party has fulfilled the commitments made to the farmers at Chhattisgarh on waiving their loan. “You can go to Punjab and Karnataka, we did the same (thing of keeping up the commitment),” he said.During his visit, Gandhi will be addressing party workers’ convention in the evening and will also meet those dependent on the mining industry.

30-10-2021||New Delhi||Modi 24-carat gold, perhaps only leader after Gandhi with deep understanding of our society: Rajnath||Hailing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as "24-carat gold", Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said he is perhaps the only leader after Mahatma Gandhi with deep understanding of Indian society and its psychology.Singh, a former BJP president, said Modi's political journey of last two decades as head of government should be taught in management schools as a case study on "effective leadership and efficient governance".Speaking at length about the last two decades of Modi's political journey, Singh said, "A true leadership is identified by its intent and integrity and in both cases, Modiji is 24-carat gold. There is not a single stain of corruption on him even after being the head of a government for 20 years."  He was speaking at the valedictory session of a national conference on 'Delivering Democracy: Reviewing 2 Decades of Narendra Modi as Head of Govt'.Singh said Modi is not merely a person, but an idea, a thought. "If we look at his political journey of the last two decades, we will find that new challenges kept coming before him. But the way he faced those challenges should be taught in management schools as a case study on effective leadership and efficient governance," the defence minister said.Singh said the way Modi overcame challenges, it shows his deep understanding of Indian society. "He is perhaps the only leader after Mahatma Gandhi with deep understanding of Indian society and its psychology."     Referring to the systematic changes that the Modi government is trying to bring in, Singh said the government has changed many times in this country, "but for the first time efforts are being to made change the system. You can find loopholes in this effort but Modiji's intent cannot be disbelieved."     Touching upon the government's agenda of a self-reliant India, the defence minister said hundred years ago Mahatma Gandhi spoke about 'Swadeshi' and after him, Deendayal Upadhyaya spoke about it.“Now Modiji has brought Swadeshi 4.0 with new context and subtext. This is not a campaign against anyone but a positive effort to strengthen local products and brands," Singh said.Talking about Modi's tenure as Gujarat chief minister, Singh said he took the state on the path of holistic development and worked for the progress of every section of the society.The defence minister said Modi gave the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' and then as prime minister added 'Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas' to it.“Yeh nara 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' dete huiyae Narendra bhai  Modi ne Gujarat mein panth nirpekshta ki ek nai ibarat likh di (By giving this slogan of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas', Narendra Bhai Modi in Gujarat wrote a new chapter of unbiasedness towards any religion)," Singh said, adding secularism does not mean unbiasedness towards any religion.Singh also cited various reforms and schemes started by Modi as Gujarat chief minister.Stating that there is no difference between Modi's words and deeds, the defence minister said he accepted the crisis of credibility in Indian politics as a challenge and overcame it.Discussing Modi's commitment to development, Singh said for a long time, promotion of trade, industry and business was avoided in this country.“It was believed that if you stand with business and industry then your social commitment is weak. Modiji gave a tough challenge to this misconception. He recognised and respected industry and entrepreneurs in nation building, supported and promoted them also," Singh said.Singh shared details of his long association with Modi when they were chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat respectively, and said Modi's amazing decision-making ability and imaginative power impressed him the most.Modi served as chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 till his election as prime minister in 2014.

All in all, Jammu and Kashmir is peaceful except for a few incidents,” Rajnath said at the valedictory session of a national conference on ‘Delivering democracy: Reviewing two decades of Narendra Modi as head of government’.He said Rajouri and Poonch in the Jammu region had been witnessing a rise in infiltration attempts since June, resulting in the killing of nine terrorists in separate encounters. “Pakistan is not able to gather any support on Kashmir. Earlier, if there were terrorist incidents, there used to be talks regarding giving ‘safe passage’ to them. Now, the situation has changed. Our government has said clearly that terrorism and talks cannot go hand in hand,” he asserted.Hailing the Prime Minister as “24-carat gold”, Rajnath said Narendra Modi was perhaps the only leader after Mahatma Gandhi with a deep understanding of the Indian society and its psychology.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajnath-singh-warns-pak-on-cross-border-terrorism-331576

Earlier, two scientists would not work together, two laboratories would not work together, two institutions would not work together; two organisations would not work together, two ministries would not work together. That has changed now,” Bhargava said at the launch of his book “Going Viral: The inside Story of Covaxin”. The book documents the Indian journey to the production of indigenous Covid vaccine and the unique ICMR-Bharat Biotech public-private partnership that developed the shot.“Secondly, we have learnt the need for speed.

Mountains are one of the most fragile eco-systems on earth. Deforestation is accelerating the process. Lt Gen SA Hasnain, member, NDMA (on increasing number of disasters in himalayas)Lt Gen Mehta, former Western Army Commander, alluded to five threats and referred to them as “elephants in the room”.“The first is internal security, followed by external security. We have China on one side and Pakistan on the other. Warfare in the past has seen kinetic dimension, today we are witnessing a non-kinetic dimension. Security in the non-kinetic dimension is that we have to worry about,” he said.“Another threat is climate change. If it happens the way it is anticipated, it will have serious impact,” said Lt Gen Mehta. “Then come disaster and pandemics, which will impact all living beings. The fifth threat is from non-traditional threats as security is no more about guns, tanks or aircraft,” he added.Kishore said the scale of the Covid-19 pandemic is unprecedented. Disaster risk management, he said, is the key to survival of business and all spheres of national life depend on how a disaster is tackled.“What we are seeing in the Himalayas are cascading disasters. It is hard to make prediction models for these. The nation has achieved success in reducing mortality during cyclones and in heat waves. We need to make infrastructure resilient to current as well as future risks,” he added.Lt Gen SA Hasnain, member, NDMA, said 12 battalions of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had been deployed across the country and four more were being raised.Krishna Vatsa, member, NDMA, said, “Disasters in India in the past were seen in the agriculture sector... The green revolution brought an end to droughts and famines. The nations fought a decisive battle in 1971 as by then the green revolution meant no shortage of grain.”Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, Director General of Meteorology, Indian Meteorology Department, asserted, “In the past five years we invested in technology and now we have a five-day advanced warning system for cyclones.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disaster-management-key-to-biz-survival-ndma-official-331579

If you want to see him as PM in 2024 then you will have to elect Yogi Adityanath as CM in 2022,” Shah said.Shah also told party cadres that a “toran” with slogan “Mera Parivaar-BJP Parivaar” should adorn every house, but while doing so they should also ask people their problems and expectations. “The party’s manifesto will be prepared on the feedback you bring from people,” he said.Amid speculations of differences between the two top BJP leaders, Shah praised Adityanath for law and order in the state. Shah did not spare rivals — SP and BSP — calling them “barsati” politicians that think only about themselves.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-will-cross-300-mark-in-up-says-amit-shah-331580

Also during the Covid period, both EU and India were impacted by overdependence on supply chains originating from China. On Afghanistan too, India and the EU are on the same page on vital issues such as inclusiveness in governance and not allowing the country to breed terror groups targeting other countries.PM Modi during his talks touched on trade, commerce, culture and the environment. “The leaders discussed ways to enhance economic as well as people-to-people linkages aimed at creating a better planet,” tweeted the PMO. The Prime Minister described his meeting with the EU leaders as “wonderful” during which they had wide-ranging talks on deepening the India-EU friendship.Michel said India had a key role to play in green transition and mentioned the EU-India strategic partnership, the situation in Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific as the prominent topics of discussion.Security-related convergence with the EU is set to grow after it unveiled an Indo-Pacific strategy which followed similar positions taken by France and Germany.An impetus to the free trade agreement was also discussed, according to Leyen. “We agreed that our trade negotiators will start to work. We’ll deepen our cooperation on climate, including on innovation and technology. Looking forward to cooperating in the Indo-Pacific,” she said.She also congratulated India for its “excellent progress” on vaccination and for resuming vaccines exports. “We need to join forces to help vaccinate the world and beat the global pandemic,” Leyen said.The 15th India-EU summit was held in virtual mode in July 2020. PM Modi later also held the first in-person meeting with his Italian counterpart Mario Draghi during which the two leaders had extensive talks on diversifying the bilateral ties.The PM will be in Rome and the Vatican City from October 29 to 31 to participate in the G-20 Summit and meet the Pope and the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin.‘Maja ma chho’, PM tells IndiansNew Delhi: Covid and farmers’ struggle necessitated a carefully curated crowd at Rome for an interaction with PM Modi but there was no diminishing of exuberance as he was greeted by lusty chants of “Bharat Mata ki jai” and “Modi-Modi” by local Indians.After paying tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at Piazza Gandhi, the PM interacted with Indians, one of whom was heard asking, “Narendra bhai, khem chho” (How are you Narendra bhai?).“Maja ma chho” (I am fine), the PM replied, which was captured on a video put out by the PMO. The PM also spoke to a crowd largely from his home state in Gujarati. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-holds-talks-with-european-union-leaders-on-trade-security-afghanistan-331585
30-10-2021||New Delhi||Bypolls to 3 Lok Sabha, 29 Assembly seats on Saturday, tight security in place||Bypolls to three Lok Sabha seats and 29 Assembly constituencies spread across 13 states and Dadra and Nagar Haveli will be held on Saturday with many contests seen as prestige issue for parties hit by defections.Adequate security and Covid safety measures have been put in place for the electoral exercise.In majority of the seats, the main fight will be between BJP and Congress candidates.The seats where Lok Sabha bye-elections will be held are Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Mandi in Himachal Pradesh and Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh.Of the 29 Assembly constituencies going to the bypolls, five are in Assam, four in West Bengal, three each in Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Meghalaya, two each in Bihar, Karnataka and Rajasthan and one seat each is in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Mizoram and Telangana.The counting of votes will take place on November 2.Though bypoll was also announced for the Shamator-Chessore Assembly constituency in Nagaland, Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party candidate S Keoshu Yimchunger was declared elected uncontested on October 13.In all the three Lok Sabha constituencies, the sitting members had died. The Mandi seat fell vacant after the death of Ramswaroop Sharma (BJP) in March. The bye-election to the Khandwa parliamentary constituency was necessitated following the death of BJP member Nand Kumar Singh Chauhan while in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, it was due to the demise of Independent Lok Sabha member Mohan Delkar.In Assam, bypolls will be conducted in Gossaigaon, Bhabanipur, Tamulpur, Mariani and Thowra seats. The ruling BJP has fielded candidates in three seats leaving the other two to alliance partner UPPL. The Congress put up nominees in all the five, while its former allies, the AIUDF and the BPF, are contesting in two and one seats respectively.Bypolls in Gossaigaon and Tamulpur were necessitated due to death of the sitting MLAs, while the incumbents of Bhabanipur, Mariani and Thowra resigned from their seats to join the ruling BJP. Elected MLAs Rupjyoti Kurmi and Sushanta Borgohain resigned from the Congress and Phanidhar Talukdar from AIUDF and are now fighting on BJP tickets.Four assembly constituencies in West Bengal will go to the bypolls with all eyes set on Dinhata where TMC heavyweight Udayan Guha is looking to reclaim the seat, which the BJP had snatched from him by a whisker in the April elections. The bypoll to Dinhata was necessitated following the resignation of Nisith Pramanik, now Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, as he chose to retain his Lok Sabha membership.The other three seats where polling will be held are Santipur in Nadia district, Khardah in North 24 Parganas and Gosaba in South 24 Parganas.In Santipur, too, BJP MP Jagannath Sarkar resigned from the assembly, thus calling for a bypoll.Bypolls to Dinhata and Santipur are seen as prestige battles for the BJP, which is currently grappling with exodus of MLAs and senior leaders.In Madhya Pradesh, bypolls will be held for the Khandwa Lok Sabha constituency and Jobat (ST), Raigaon (SC) and Prithvipur assembly seats.Bye-elections in Rajasthan’s Vallabhnagar and Dhariawad are being viewed as a significant test for the performance of the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government.Though the number of constituencies going to bypolls is not crucial from the viewpoint of the government’s stability but the results will send a message across the state about the performance of the government, which had faced a major threat last year due to rebellion of the then deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 MLAs led by him.The bypoll to the Ellenabad assembly constituency in Haryana’s Sirsa district is set to witness a triangular contest, with opposition INLD’s Abhay Singh Chautala, whose resignation over the farm laws issue necessitated the election, eyeing another win.The three central farm laws have emerged as key issue as a major part of Ellenabad is rural with people mostly relying on agriculture.The bypolls to Mandi Lok Sabha and Arki, Fatehpur and Jubbal-Kotkhai Vidhan Sabha seats in Himachal Pradesh are crucial as assembly elections are due in the state next year.According to local Congress and BJP leaders, the results of the bypolls are likely to impact the assembly elections.Polling will also be held in Huzurabad assembly constituency in Telangana with the ruling TRS, opposition BJP and Congress locked in a triangular contest.The bye-election has been necessitated in view of the resignation of Eatala Rajender in June following his removal from the state Cabinet over allegations of land grabbing. Rajender, who dismissed the allegations, has quit the TRS and joined the BJP. He is seeking re-election on BJP ticket.The bypoll is seen as a do-or-die battle for Rajender, while it is significant for the BJP as it aims at emerging as the alternative to ruling TRS in the 2023 Legislative Assembly elections. It is crucial for the TRS as well as it would like to demonstrate that its dominance in state politics continues unchallenged.The bye-elections in Karnataka’s Hanagal and Sindgi constituencies will be the first electoral test for Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who had replaced B S Yediyurappa.Bypolls will also be held in Andhra Pradesh’s Badvel seat; Tarapur and Kusheshwar constituencies in Bihar;  Meghalaya’s Rajabala, Mawryngkneng and Mawphlang seats; Deglur in Maharashtra; and Tuirial assembly seat in Mizoram.

30-10-2021||New Delhi||Ex-CAG Vinod Rai should apologise to nation for conspiring to destabilise UPA Government: Congress||The Congress accused former CAG Vinod Rai on Friday of being a conspirator to destabilise the Manmohan Singh-led UPA Government and demanded that he apologise to the nation for doing so.It said Rai stood “exposed” after he tendered an unconditional apology to former Congress MP Sanjay Nirupam for “wrongly mentioning” him as one of the MPs who had pressured him not to name former prime minister Manmohan Singh in the CAG report on 2G spectrum allocation.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera told reporters here that Rai admitted on Thursday that he had lied in 2014 to Nirupam and apologised to him.“Imagine a man who can lie to sell a book, what all can he do to push his own agenda and the agenda of his masters,” he said.“We demand that Rai apologise to the entire nation in the same manner in which he unconditionally apologised to Nirupam,” Khera said.He said the former Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) needs to issue an unconditional apology to the country as he owes one “for making a fool of everyone”.Khera said the time has come to undo the wrong done to Singh’s government, to the Congress and to the country.“We are convinced beyond any doubt that this was a massive conspiracy to derail the economy, to discredit a popularly-elected government of Manmohan Singh. We demand an apology from Rai and the other co-conspirators and as far as their master is concerned, people will take care of him very soon.“We also demand that all those puppets, who were involved in this treason by becoming co-conspirators, should apologise to the country,” he said.Khera said the Congress also demands that Rai return all the facilities given to him as “a reward or remuneration” after his retirement to the government treasury.He said the media that brandished Rai’s image as an honest government officer should also answer today. “If he was honest, why did he offer an unconditional apology through the court to Sanjay Nirupam? Why isn’t the media asking those very tough questions to Vinod Rai today?” the Congress leader asked.He said there are major concerns emerging as a result of these developments and the credibility of all the reports authored by Rai during his tenure as the CAG ought to be questioned as his actions since he demitted office seem to suggest a disturbing trend.Khera said one should not forget that Rai was associated with the “India against Corruption” movement, the key players of which included Anna Hazare, who has never uttered a single word against the Narendra Modi Government, Arvind Kejriwal, who became the Chief Minister of Delhi, and Kiran Bedi, who was made the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry.“This clearly shows how the then CAG Vinod Rai had, along with his buddies from the India against Corruption farce movement, orchestrated a criminal conspiracy to destabilise and bring down a constitutionally-elected government that was working for the welfare of the common people, especially the poor and the marginalised,” he said.The Congress leader said the most significant question is, who was the mastermind behind all of this.“Who hatched the criminal conspiracy to destabilise a democratically-elected government? Who worked hard to derail a sound economy and defame an honest and capable Prime Minister?” he asked, adding that the CBI gave a clean chit to Singh in the 2G spectrum case and the special CBI court, in its judgment, stated that the prosecution had miserably failed to prove any charge.

The law is the same for all. The deadline for receiving the bail papers was 5.30 pm. That has passed. He won't be released today,” senior jail official told PTI.The HC on Friday afternoon made available its operative order in which it imposed 14 bail conditions on Aryan Khan and his co-accused in the case, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha, who were also granted bail, stipulating their release on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh each with one or two sureties of the same amount.In the five-page order, signed by Justice N W Sambre, the high court said the trio will have to surrender their passports before the NDPS court and shall not leave India without taking permission from the special court.Also, they will have to attend the NCB office each Friday between 11 am and 2 pm to mark their presence, the HC said.The judge will give a detailed bail order with reasons next week.The HC said if the trio violates any of the conditions imposed then the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), which is probing the cruise drugs case, shall "straightaway apply to the special judge/court for cancellation of their bail." "Each of the applicants/accused shall execute personal bond of Rs 1 lakh with one or more sureties in the like amount," the order said.The HC said the accused shall not personally or through anyone make any attempt to influence witnesses or tamper with the evidence.The high court directed the trio to surrender their passports before the special NDPS court and shall not leave India without taking permission from the special court. The accused should give prior intimation to the NCB before leaving Mumbai and shall provide with their itinerary.It added that Aryan Khan, his friend Merchant and Dhamecha, a fashion model, shall not indulge in any activity similar to the activities on the basis of which the present case stands registered against them for offences under the NDPS Act.The HC further said the trio shall not establish any contact with any of the co-accused in the case or anyone involved in similar activities, and join the investigation as and when called by the NCB."Once the trial begins, the applicants/accused shall not in any manner try to delay the trial," the court said.While Aryan Khan and Merchant are lodged at the Arthur Road prison in central Mumbai, Dhamecha is at the Byculla women's prison.Chawla arrived at the special court along with Aryan Khan's legal team, including advocate Satish Maneshinde, and submitted the surety and necessary documents.They appeared before special Judge V V Patil where Maneshinde said Chawla would be standing as surety and submitted her Aadhaar card for verification.While Chawla stood in front of the judge, Maneshinde told the court that the actress knows the applicant (Aryan Khan) since his childhood and that she and his father (Shah Rukh Khan) are professionally associated.The court, after verification, accepted the surety following which Chawla was asked to go to the court's registry department to sign the necessary papers.Once there, a crowd gathered to click photos with the actress.After Chawla signed the papers, they were sent back to the court for the judge to sign the surety bond and issue the release memo.While leaving the court building, Chawla told reporters, "There is a sense of relief in the family. We are all happy it is over." Aryan Khan's legal team later left the court with the memo for the Arthur Road prison, but failed to meet the 5.30 pm deadline for jail officials to accept release documents.Earlier, Aryan Khan's legal team had indicated that a “slight postponement till 7 pm" was possible.Aryan Khan, Merchant and Dhamecha were arrested by the NCB on October 3 and booked under relevant sections of the NDPS Act for possession, consumption, sale/purchase of banned drugs and conspiracy and abetment.Their arrest came a day after the NCB raided the cruise ship and claimed to have seized banned drugs. So far, 20 people have been arrested in the case and two of them were granted bail by the special NDPS court earlier this week.

30-10-2021||New Delhi||We stand vindicated, say farm unions as cops begin removing barricades at farmers' protest sites||With Delhi Police beginning to remove barricades at two farmer protest sites -- Tikri and Ghazipur -- farm union leaders on Friday said the move vindicated their stand that they never blocked roads at the city border points.Also read: Barricades put up by Delhi Police, not farmers: BKU after SC order to unblock roadsPolice start removing barricades at Ghazipur farmers’ protest siteBarricades removed at Tikri borderFarmer leaders said any decision to entirely clear both the carriageways at the protest sites would be taken by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM).They, however, said way would be made for traffic to move in the coming days.Delhi Police's decision comes days after a Supreme Court hearing that saw farmer unions argue that the police were responsible for the blockade at the city's borders.Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) office-bearers said police and not farmers had blocked roads, adding that they are being "reopened on the directions of the Supreme Court".In light of the removal of barricades at Ghazipur border protest site, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said, “The future course of the ongoing farmers' protest will be decided by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, which is leading the movement against the three farm laws.”Senior farmer leader and SKM member Darshan Pal said false allegations were being levelled against farmers that they had blocked roads, which had been rejected by them from day one.Pal said that at Singhu border, farmers had occupied the portion of road which is already closed for traffic due to construction of a flyover.“Now, the exercise of removal of barricades by the police clearly proves our point that it was the police who had blocked roads and not the farmers. We never created any problem. Any bottleneck from our side will also be cleared for traffic movement,” Pal told PTI.

30-10-2021||Panaji||Leander Paes, Nafisa Ali join Trinamool Congress||Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee, on a visit to Goa where polls are due next year, on Friday said her party is national and “can go anywhere”, and its initials—TMC—also stand for “temple, mosque and church.”  The BJP calls her “anti-Hindu”, but it has no right to issue a “character certificate”, the West Bengal chief minister said.Asked whether she was eyeing the prime minister’s post in 2024, she evaded reply.The West Bengal chief minister, who arrived in the BJP-ruled Goa on Thursday evening on a three-day visit, said the TMC did not intend to divide votes in the coastal state, and if it came to power, Goa will not be run from Delhi.On Friday, she met local party leaders and also interacted with members of the fishing community at Malim Jetty near here.Tennis player Leander Paes, actor Nafisa Ali and entrepreneur Mrinalini Deshprabhu joined the TMC in her presence.Addressing local TMC leaders at another event, Banerjee said, “When I come to Goa, they deface my posters. You (BJP) will be blacklisted by the people from the country.“You deface us, show black flags, refuse to grant permission (to hold event) because you know that TMC will die but will never compromise,” she further said.If the TMC won power in Goa, it will not pursue an agenda of revenge but work for the state, she said.Listing various welfare schemes implemented by her government in West Bengal, she said her party can do it in a smaller state like Goa too.“I will be happy to do it. I am not going to be the chief minister of Goa, but I will see to it that there is a policy, mechanism and no corruption in the government,” Banerjee added.The TMC is a national party and “it can go anywhere,” she asserted.“We will work for Goa in a resolute way. It is not that we want to divide votes. You have given opportunity to all (other) parties, now give opportunity to the TMC,” Banerjee said.“BJP calls me anti-Hindu, but they are no one to give me character certificate. They should first decide their own character certificate,” she said.The TMC doesn’t divide people on the basis of religion but “we unite people,” and the party’s initials “stand for temple, mosque and church,” Banerjee added.Recalling her stint as a Union minister in the past, the TMC chief said she has travelled across the country. “I know India very well,” she said.Speaking to the media, Banerjee, who inflicted defeat on the BJP in an intensely fought assembly election in her home state earlier this year, evaded reply when asked if she was aiming for the prime minister’s post in 2024.“If I tell you everything right now, what will I tell later?” she said.Asked whether the TMC’s decision to contest Goa elections next year was part of a larger plan about the 2024 general elections, Banerjee said, “We will contest the elections in 2024.“We are transparent. We don’t play hide and seek. We will are a transparent party,” she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/leander-paes-nafisa-ali-join-trinamool-congress-331460

30-10-2021||Ghaziabad||Police start removing barricades at Ghazipur farmers’ protest site||Delhi Police on Friday started removing the barricades and concertina wires it had put in place at the anti-farm laws protest site at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border.Multiple layers of iron and cement barricades, and at least five layers of concertina wires were put up last year, and further strengthened after the January 26 violence this year during the farmers' protest against the three contentious farm laws.Also read: Farmers have right to protest but they can’t block roads indefinitely: Supreme CourtBarricades put up by Delhi Police, not farmers: BKU after SC order to unblock roadsDeputy Commissioner of Police (East) Priyanka Kashyap said on Friday, "The process of removing barricades on NH-9 has been started. The temporary barricading is being removed to ease out vehicular movement. However, the National Highway 24 was already opened for the traffic."The opening of the road stretch will help thousands of commuters in Ghaziabad, Delhi, Noida as well as those travelling between the national capital and interiors of Uttar Pradesh to Meerut and beyond.Police officials and labourers were also seen removing iron nails that were studded on the NH9 at Ghazipur, where hundreds of protesters, chiefly belonging to the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), have been occupying a road stretch since November 2020.Also read: Barricades removed at Tikri borderThe BKU is a participant of the anti-farm laws movement spearheaded by farmers collective Samyukta Kisan Morcha.The removal of barricades comes after the October 21 Supreme Court direction that called for unblocking of roads which have remained out of bounds for commuters due to the protests at Delhi's border points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur.While the protesting farmers have been claiming that the three laws enacted last year are against their interest, the Centre has been saying these legislations are pro-farmer.Thousands of farmers have been camping at the three borders points -- Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur -- protesting the Centre's three farm laws since November 26, 2020.About the removal of blockades at the Tikri Border on Thursday night, a senior police officer had said some layers of barricades that were placed by the police had been removed.The Supreme Court on October 21 had said farmers protesting at Delhi borders against the three farms laws had the right to agitate but they could not block roads indefinitely.
