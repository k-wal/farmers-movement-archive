13-10-2021||New Delhi||Row over Rajnath Singh’s comments on Savarkar: Congress, historian Irfan Habib and Owaisi slam BJP for ‘distortion of history’||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh appears to have stirred up quite a controversy with his comment that it was on Mahatma Gandhi’s request that Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, or Veer Savarkar as he is popularly known, wrote mercy petitions.Opposition leaders, and some historians as well, attacked him, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and the BJP, accusing them of “trying to rewrite history”.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi shared on Twitter a letter by Gandhi on January 25, 1920 to Savarkar’s brother regarding a case and accused Singh of giving a “twist” to that.“Rajnath Singhji is amongst the few sober and dignified voices in Modi Sarkar. But he doesn’t seem to be free of the RSS habit of rewriting history. He has given a twist to what Gandhi actually wrote on January 25, 1920. Here is that letter to Savarkar’s brother,” Ramesh said, sharing the letter.Owaisi said the BJP will soon declare Savarkar as ‘father of the nation’ after the defence minister called him ‘mahanayak’ of Indian freedom struggle yesterday.The AIMIM chief said the first petition Savarkar wrote was in 1911, just six months after getting to prison and Gandhi was then in South Africa. Savarkar wrote again in 1913/14 and Gandhi’s advice is from 1920.“Rajnath Singh you said that Savarkar’s grovelling mercy petitions were on Gandhi’s advice. Here’s the letter to Savarkar from Gandhi. No mention of petition to British begging for leniency, mercy & promising to be a faithful servant of the crown,” Owaisi tweeted.Historian S Irfan Habib said, “Yes, monochromatic history writing is really changing, led by the Minister who claims Gandhi asked Savarkar to write mercy petitions. At least it is accepted now that he did write. No documentary evidence needed when the Minister makes a claim. New history for New India.”Defending Savarkar, Rajya Sabha MP Rakesh Sinha said “Congress opposes Savarkar ji who never integrated with British administration and exhibited the highest sacrifice for the Motherland. However, some people had regular dining at Mountbatten’s home!”BJP IT cell in-charge Amit Malviya quoted Gandhi on Savarkar: “He is clever. He is brave, he is a patriot. The evil, in its hidden form of the present system of Government, he saw much earlier than I did. He is in the Andamans for having loved India too well. Under a just government he would be occupying a high post.”BJP ally Janata Dal (United) demanded that letters exchanged between Gandhi and Savarkar should be made public to shed light on the matter.Singh at an event to release a book on Savarkar yesterday alleged a “deliberate conspiracy” to defame Savarkar saying that it was on Gandhi’s advice that he wrote his mercy petitions. “He was an icon of Indian history and will remain so.“Lies are spread about Savarkar repeatedly. It was spread that he filed many mercy petitions seeking his release from jails. It was Mahatma Gandhi who asked him to file the mercy petitions,” the Defence Minister claimed.Bhagwat also alleged big game-plan to defame the Sangh Parivar and Savarkar after the Independence, describing him as a “true nationalist”. Amid the to and fro, historian and Savarkar’s biographer Vikram Sampath slammed the critics, saying “for the doubting Toms & asinine commentators, asking source etc pls (please) refer “Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi” vol 19, pp 348 & Vol 20, pp 368-371.“I hope you don’t say Gandhi Ashram has doctored these letters. Can’t spoon feed you fellows more than this.  “Some needless brouhaha about the statement by Rajnath Singh.“In my Vol 1 and in countless interviews I had stated already that in 1920 Gandhiji advised Savarkar brothers to file a petition and even made a case for his release through an essay in Young India 26 May 1920. So what’s noise about.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/row-over-rajnath-singhs-comments-on-savarkar-congress-historian-irfan-habib-and-owaisi-slam-bjp-for-distortion-of-history-324102

13-10-2021||Bengaluru||Congress spokesman, media coordinator link party unit chief to scam; video goes viral||The Congress in Karnataka on Wednesday found itself in a tight spot after a video showed a purported conversation between the party media coordinator M A Saleem and former Lok Sabha member VS Ugrappa attributing the Congress state president DK Shivakumar to an alleged scam when he was a minister.Taking strong exception to the clipping that went viral, Shivakumar said he cannot deny that the conversation did not take place and rejected the content of the conversation. Acting swiftly, the party suspended Saleem from the party for six years and served a show-cause notice to Ugrappa, who is Congress spokesperson, seeking an explanation in three days.The conversation is said to be related to the scams in the Irrigation Department when Shivakumar was the Irrigation Minister in the coalition government of Congress-JD(S), which ran for 14 months and collapsed in June 2019.    The video gave the BJP cause to hit out at the Congress and Shivakumar with a spokesperson of the saffron party alleging that former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was behind the drama.However, Ugrappa clarified that Saleem was only briefing him what the BJP leaders have been talking about the raids carried out by the Income Tax (I-T) Department since October 7 against three major contractors executing irrigation and highway project on their 47 premises in four states, including Karnataka and Maharashtra.The search and seizure by the I-T officials have resulted in detection of undisclosed income of about Rs 750 crore, the I-T Department said in a statement on Tuesday.Minutes before the press conference by Ugrappa on Tuesday, Saleem sat next to him and started whispering about the scams. Incidentally, the conversation was recorded.In the purported video, Saleem is heard saying, “Earlier, it was eight per cent. He increased it to 12 per cent. These are all adjustments by DKS.”   “Uppar and G Shankar, the one from Hospet in Ballari, whom you know. Uppar is from Bengaluru,” Saleem was seen explaining.When Ugrappa corrected him that Uppar is from Vijayapura, Saleem said Uppar’s house is right opposite to former Chief Minister SM Krishna’s in Bengaluru.“It’s (Irrigation) a big scandal. If dug properly, his (D K Shivakumar) role will also come out. You don’t know, sir, the three (contractors) made Rs 50-100 crore. If they had made so much (of wealth), then guess how much he (Shivakumar) would have made. He is a collection ‘giraaki’ (extortionist),” Saleem is heard saying.In reply, Ugrappa said he did not know those things.“I don’t know this. We all lobbied to make him (Shivakumar) state president. That’s why I am not saying anything. These are the reasons...,” Ugrappa is heard saying.Further, Saleem said Shivakumar stammers these days.“He stammers these days, maybe because of low BP or something else,” Saleem said to which Ugrappa agreed.Saleem also wondered whether Shivakumar drinks as he gets emotional these days.He then hailed Siddaramaiah for his strong body language.Shivakumar said the conversation between Saleem and Ugrappa, which media has shown, has actually taken place.“You have shown that they have spoken ill against me. I will not deny it. They have spoken against me,” Shivakumar said in a press conference.He further said he has no connection with the content of the conversation.“I am unrelated to what they have spoken. I was never part of any ‘percentage’ (share in contracts) and I don’t need it. I have no connection with it (share in contracts),” Shivakumar said.Clarifying, Ugrappa held a press conference today and said Shivakumar and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah are like the two eyes of the party in Karnataka and both were dear to him.Ugrappa said Saleem was briefing him about what the BJP leaders were talking outside following raids. However, the place chosen by him was wrong and he could have spoken in private and not before the media, he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-spokesman-media-coordinator-link-party-unit-chief-to-scam-video-goes-viral-324092

But when contacted later, he told PTI over phone that he had gone to extend condolences and pay his tributes.“We are with the families of all the deceased. It is a very unfortunate incident and the guilty will be punished after an impartial inquiry,” he said.He said he met the families of the two deceased and assured medical help and treatment to the parents of one of them who are not well.“The families have not made any demand but we are with the families of all the victims. We also assured them of impartial action in the matter,” he said, adding that he will visit the third victim soon.“I will meet the families of all the victims,” he said.While Rahul Gandhi, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, BSP general secretary S C Mishra, AAP MP Sanjay Singh and Delhi MLA Raghav Chadha have visited the homes of the four farmers and journalist Raman Kashyap, they are yet to meet the families of the other three deceased.While some district-level BJP leaders did visit the homes of the two party workers and driver, Pathak is the first notable personality to do so.A sum of Rs 45 lakh each was also given to the families of the two BJP workers and the minister’s driver as compensation, an amount equal to that provided to the kin of the four farmers and the journalist.The compensation cheque to the families Shubham Mishra and Hariom Mishra was given by BJP’s Lakhimpur (Sadar) MLA Yogesh Verma, away from the media glare on Thursday.A government official has said the ex-gratia money has been given to families of all eight people by the government.The visit of Pathak, who is a Brahmin, also appears to have a political overtone as the three belonged to the same caste as the minister. It is also being seen as a message to BJP workers that they are cared for by the party.

He was picked up by a joint team of the Jewar police, the Special Operations Group, and the SWAT,” a police spokesperson said.“A reward of Rs 25,000 was announced on information leading to the arrest of Mahendra in the wake of the incident in which another person has already been arrested and sent to jail,” he added.An FIR in connection with the incident has been lodged under Indian Penal Code sections 376D (gangrape), 352 (punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation), and 506 (criminal intimidation), police said.Sections under the stringent Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, have also been invoked in the case, they added.Mahendra, according to the police, was also booked for house trespassing and theft in the past.He is the only named accused in the FIR. Of the three other accused, one was arrested on Monday after the rape survivor identified him from a picture shown to her by the police. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-key-accused-in-dalit-womans-gangrape-in-jewar-arrested-324090

13-10-2021||Washington||India among countries to lead thematic discussions at counter ransomware initiative meet: WH||India is among the four countries that have volunteered to organise and lead specific thematic discussions at the first-of-its-kind international meeting to counter ransomware convened by the Biden administration, that will chalk out a four-part strategy to address the challenges posed in the cyberworld, the White House said on Wednesday.Joined by ministers and senior officials from over 30 countries and the European Union to accelerate cooperation to counter ransomware, the two-day meet that ends on Thursday, builds on President Joe Biden's leadership to rally allies and partners to counter the shared threat of ransomware.“While the United States is facilitating this meeting, we don't view this solely as a US initiative. Indeed, we're bringing other countries together,” a senior administration official said.“Many governments have been indispensable in organising the meeting, and four countries in particular have volunteered to lead and organise specific thematic discussions: India for resilience, Australia for disruption, the UK for virtual currency, and Germany for diplomacy,” said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.The White House official described a four-part strategy to coordinate a whole-of-government effort.“First: disrupt ransomware infrastructure and actors. We're bringing the full weight of US government capabilities to disrupt ransomware actors, networks, financial infrastructure, and other facilitators,” the official said.The second part of the strategy is bolstering resilience to withstand ransomware attacks.“Even as we work to disrupt criminal ransomware networks, we also have to address our own vulnerabilities so we're not easy targets,” the official said.“Third, we're addressing the abuse of virtual currency to launder ransom payments. We're leveraging existing and acquiring new capabilities to trace and interdict ransomware proceeds,” the official said.“Finally, leveraging international cooperation to disrupt the ransomware ecosystem and address safe harbours for ransomware criminals,” said the official.Countries participating in the two-day meet include Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Estonia, the European Union, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, the UAE, and the UK.According to a White House fact-sheet, ransomware incidents have disrupted critical services and businesses worldwide – schools, banks, government offices, emergency services, hospitals, energy companies, transportation, and food companies have all been affected. Ransomware attackers have targeted organisations of all sizes, regardless of where they are located.The global economic losses from ransomware are significant. Ransomware payments reached over USD 400 million globally in 2020, and topped USD 81 million in the first quarter of 2021, illustrating the financially driven nature of these activities.According to the White House, the Administration is working closely with international partners to address the shared threat of ransomware and galvanise global political will to counter ransomware activities – as reflected in the recent G7 and North Atlantic Treasury Organisation (NATO) joint statements, and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) efforts, among others. The Administration continues to advocate for expanded membership in, and implementation of, the Budapest Convention and its principles, it said.Further, US departments and agencies continue to engage with countries to improve their capacity for addressing ransomware threats, including through capacity building that promotes cybersecurity best practices and combats cybercrime, such as trainings on network defence and resilience, cyber hygiene, virtual currency analysis, and other training and technical assistance to foreign law enforcement partners to combat criminal misuse of information technologies.“The United States remains committed to eliminating safe harbours for ransomware criminals through a more direct diplomatic approach.

13-10-2021||Hamirpur (UP)||Akhilesh attacks ‘chillumjeevi’ Adityanath, says BJP will never act against Union minister Mishra||Lashing out at the BJP, Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday said the saffron party would never act against the Union minister whose son has been arrested in connection with the Lakhimpur killings as it “stands with criminals”, who are the happiest under the current regime.In an indirect reference to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, he used the term “chillumjeevi”. “Chillum” is a smoking pipe often used by “sadhus”.On his “Vijay Rath Yatra” here, Yadav said Adityanath has a liking for two things—the bull and the bulldozer—but the people of Bundelkhand have decided that the steering of the bulldozer, which is in their hands, will be snatched from him in next year’s Assembly election.“They will run the bulldozer of votes on the BJP in the coming polls,” he said.Yadav was apparently referring to the stray cattle menace in Uttar Pradesh and the government’s drive to raze buildings, the plans for many of which were not approved, in various parts of the state.“The BJP will never act against the (Union) minister because it stands with criminals. If criminals are the happiest anywhere, it is under the BJP government,” he said, replying to questions from reporters on the Lakhimpur Kheri incident.Eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed in the October 3 violence that erupted during a farmers’ protest in Lakhimpur Kheri. Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra is among those arrested in connection with the incident.Without taking any names, Yadav said the “chillumjeevi” is out to distribute tablet computers among students now and wondered why such an initiative was not taken in the last over four years.He warned the people against the “chillumjeevi” and asked them if they had understood who was he referring to.The SP president was apparently referring to the chief minister distributing tablet computers and smartphones among youngsters recently.Addressing a public meeting later, Yadav said, “When farmers protested against agriculture laws, they were crushed under the wheels of vehicles.”Hitting out at the ruling BJP over three contentious farm laws of the Centre, he said, “I want to tell the farmers of Bundelkhand, Uttar Pradesh and the country that the manner in which the BJP has brought the three black laws, it will crush you like the (four) farmers were crushed and killed in Lakhimpur Kheri.”“As of now, farmers and laws have been crushed, and the Constitution might also be crushed. So the BJP needs to be removed on the strength of votes,” the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister added.On the state of affairs in the water-scarce Bundelkhand region, he said, “Maximum number of farmers have committed suicide in Mahoha, Hamirpur, Banda and the surrounding areas and after coming to power, the SP government will extend all facilities to the farmers here, be it irrigation or mandis.”He alleged that the three new farm laws brought by the Centre will force farmers to quit farming and make them labourers.“There is very less time left for the election. The BJP does not want to give the backward classes and Dalits their rights and therefore, a caste-based census has not taken place till now. It should be done as the BJP says that Yadavs have benefitted the most. I want to tell them that they are misleading the people,” the SP chief said.Reiterating his charge that projects launched during his tenure as chief minister have been re-inaugurated and renamed by the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, Yadav alleged that the current regime has sold away government assets.He also alleged that in the name of a defence corridor in the Bundelkhand region, the land of farmers has been acquired but no industry has come up here.“This is the ‘sutli bomb’ (damp squib) of the BJP. They had shown the dream of a defence corridor and betrayed the poor people of Bundelkhand. These are people who tell lies and there is a need to be alert about them. Just think, if a yogi is telling lies, where will the people go,” Yadav said.Talking about the “samajwadi pension scheme” launched by his government, he said if needed, the amount under the scheme would be increased three-fold after the SP comes to power again.The scheme, started by Yadav in 2014, provides a monthly pension of Rs 500 to families falling under the Below Poverty Line.

13-10-2021||New Delhi||Centre notifies new rules for allowing abortion till 24 weeks of pregnancy for certain categories of women||The central government has notified new rules under which the gestational limit for termination of a pregnancy has been increased from 20-24 weeks for certain categories of women.According to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Rules, 2021, these categories include survivors of sexual assault or rape or incest, minors, women whose marital status changes during an ongoing pregnancy (widowhood and divorce) and those with physical disabilities.The new rules also cover mentally ill women, cases of foetal malformation that has a substantial risk of being incompatible with life or if the child is born it may suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities to be seriously handicapped and women with pregnancy in humanitarian settings or disaster or emergency situations as may be declared by the government.The new rules come under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2021, passed by Parliament in March.Earlier, abortion required the opinion of one doctor if it is done within 12 weeks of conception and two doctors if it is done between 12 and 20 weeks.According to the new rules, a state-level medical board will be set up to decide if a pregnancy may be terminated after 24 weeks in cases of foetal malformation and if the foetal malformation has a substantial risk of it being incompatible with life or if the child is born it may suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities to be seriously handicapped.The function of the Medical Board shall be to examine the woman and her reports if she approaches for medical termination of pregnancy and provide the opinion with regard to the termination of pregnancy or rejection of a request for termination within three days of receiving the request.The Board has also been tasked to ensure that the termination procedure, when advised by it, is carried out with all safety precautions along with appropriate counselling within five days of the receipt of the request for medical termination of pregnancy.Poonam Muttreja, the Executive Director of the Population Foundation of India (PFI), said given the advancements in scientific and medical technology, the extended 24 week gestation period should apply to all women and not just ‘special categories of women’.“We welcome the new rules under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act notified by the Union Government recently, which are an outcome of the MTP Amendment Act, 2021, passed by Parliament in March this year.”“However, given the advancements in scientific and medical technology the world has witnessed over the years, the extended 24 week gestation period should be for all women and not just ‘special categories of women’,” she said.“In addition, the creation of state medical boards could potentially create impediments for women’s access to abortion services as many women discover they are pregnant at a later stage,” Muttreja added.Dr. Jaideep Malhotra, founder of Rainbow IVF and former president of Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India, said it is a “much-awaited, sensitive and forward-looking amendment” for both the beneficiaries and the gynaecologists, who faced this turmoil for years and had their hands tied in the face of the law.Dr. Loveleena Nadir, a senior gynecologist, said the new rules of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act notified by the Union Government are a welcome move and a leap ahead for women’s reproductive choices.“I hope that this is a first step towards making safe abortion accessible to all women and not just restricted to women in special categories,” said Dr. Loveleena Nadir, Senior Gynecologist in New Delhi.“This would empower women and make India a liberal woman supporting country,” Nadir added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-notifies-new-rules-for-allowing-abortion-till-24-weeks-of-pregnancy-for-certain-categories-of-women-324067
13-10-2021||Mumbai||‘Congratulations’: Pawar’s dig at Fadnavis over his ‘I still feel CM’ remarks||In a dig at senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis, who had said that he still feels as chief minister of Maharashtra, NCP president Sharad Pawar on Wednesday said he lacked this trait even though he had served as CM for four times.Fadnavis on Tuesday said that because of the people’s love, he did not feel that he had ceased to be the Chief Minister.“It’s good that the BJP leader still considers himself as the chief minister. I congratulate him. After being the chief minister for five years, Fadnavis still feels he is holding the post. I lacked this trait. I had served as chief minister (of Maharashtra) four times. But I don’t even remember,” Pawar said.He also referred to Fadnavis’ famous “Me Punha Yein” (I will return) slogan which had become popular before the 2019 Maharashtra assembly elections.The slogan had become a subject of ridicule and inspired many mock-filled messages and WhatsApp memes taking a dig at the BJP leader.Fadnavis, while speaking at an event in Navi Mumbai, had said that “the people of Maharashtra never made me feel that I am not the chief minister”.“I still feel that I am chief minister as I have been roaming in the state over the last two years. The love and affection of people have not receded,” he had said.Fadnavis became the chief minister of Maharashtra after the 2014 elections and went on to complete a full term, something which no chief minister of the state had managed in the previous three decades.After the Shiv Sena walked out of the alliance with the BJP after the 2019 polls, he forged a tie-up with a breakaway group of NCP MLAs led by Ajit Pawar and was sworn in as chief minister with Pawar as his deputy.But this government lasted only for three days for want of the numbers and was replaced by an alliance of the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, headed by Uddhav Thackeray.

Senior NCP leader and former state minister Anil Deshmukh is also facing probe by Central agencies on multiple charges.The NCB recently conducted a number of raids, including on some high-profile people.Apart from the recent drugs bust onboard a cruise liner off the Mumbai coast, that led to the arrest of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan, the NCB last year investigated a drug case linked to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and several other matters related to narcotics involving high-profile people.

He also interacted with the veterans of the Sri Lankan Army.He had served in the IPKP in Sri Lanka’s north and east from 1987-1990.“(His) Visit will pave (the) way for deeper cooperation in defence between India and Sri Lanka,” the Indian High Commission here said in a tweet on Tuesday.During his visit, Gen Naravane is expected to call on President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who is the Commander-in-Chief of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces, and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.On Thursday, he will witness the final demonstration of the ongoing bilateral Exercise ‘Mitra Shakti’ at Maduru Oya Special Forces Training School in the east.India and Sri Lanka last week began a 12-day mega military exercise with a focus on enhancing counter-terror cooperation at the Combat Training School in the island nation’s eastern district of Ampara.The eighth edition of the ‘Mitra Shakti’ exercise from October 4 to 15 got underway with the participation of an all arms contingent of 120 Indian Army personnel, headed by Colonel Prakash Kumar.The joint military exercise has been designed to enhance understanding of transnational terrorism, inter-operability skills, conduct of joint tactical operations, sharing of each other’s best practices and experiences, the Sri Lanka Army said.The annual training programme, which has largely contributed to strengthen bilateral military cooperation, understanding and bonds of neighbourly relations between both services, takes place alternately either in India or Sri Lanka every year, it added.Gen Naravane’s visit is taking place a week after Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla visited Sri Lanka and met the country’s top leadership and underscored the importance India attaches to expeditiously taking forward mutually beneficial projects.

13-10-2021||New Delhi||Delhi riots: HC denies bail to 2 accused in case concerning recovery of body from drain||The Delhi High Court has refused bail to two persons who were arrested in a Delhi riots case related to the recovery of a 15-year old boy’s body from a drain in Gokulpuri area.Justice Mukta Gupta stated that in view of the witnesses, who saw the petitioners—Ankit Chaudhary and Rishabh Chaudhary—assault people of the other religion, no ground for their release was made out.The judge added that since the petitioners resided in the vicinity of the place of the crime, their “tower location” as per call records was not sufficient to conclude that the petitioners were not present at the spot as they may have left phones at their residences.According to the prosecution, the body, found to be of a 15-year-old, had injury marks on the backside of the head, was recovered from the drain on March 1, 2020.The father of the deceased identified the body by the clothes on March 13, 2020, it was said.The FIR was registered for the commission of several offences under the Indian Penal Code, including murder by Gokulpuri police station.The court noted that as per the statement of an eyewitness, some people, including the petitioners, had gathered near a poolia (bridge) and attacked passers-by with sticks, rods and stones and thereafter threw the body in the nala (drain).“It is evident that the three witnesses have clearly identified the two petitioners with the other accused who were present at the spot and were looking at the IDs of each and every person and on being identified from the other religion, the said passer bye’s were being assaulted. Since the accused have been named in statements of the witnesses, no TIP was required to be performed of the accused,” the court said.“As regards the call detail record location of the petitioners is concerned, the petitioners are residing in the vicinity of the place of incident and hence the tower location of the petitioners at the relevant time would not be sufficient to conclude that the petitioners were not present at the spot for the reason it may also be possible that the petitioners left their mobile phone at their residences,” it added.After perusing the testimony of the witnesses, the court also opined that prima facie, there were no material contradictions in the statement of the witnesses.“Considering the nature of evidence against the two petitioners particularly the ocular testimony of the witnesses who are local residents this Court finds no ground to grant regular bail to the petitioners. Petitions are dismissed,” the court ruled.Counsel for Ankit Chaudhary contended that there was a material contradiction in the statements of witnesses and the cell location of his client did not show him present at the place of incident.It was also argued that there was no recovery from the petitioner and there was no CCTV footage to shows his involvement in the alleged offence.Counsel for Rishabh Chaudhary also alleged that the evidence was manipulated and that he was not a member of a WhatsApp group ‘Kattar Hindu Ekta’ whose participants were implicated in FIRs concerning the recovery of several dead bodies from the drain. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-hc-denies-bail-to-2-accused-in-case-concerning-recovery-of-body-from-drain-324046

13-10-2021||---||'Taxpayers’ money wasted in past, no longer': PM launches Rs 100 lakh cr Gati Shakti plan to boost infra||New Delhi, October 13Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday launched Rs 100 lakh crore Gati Shakti National Master Plan to boost Indian infrastructure and multi-modal connectivity over the next 25 years and reduce logistics cost for improved global competitiveness.Noting that taxpayers' money was wasted in the past by way of delayed projects and lack of inter-departmental coordination, the PM said the government was now nurturing a work culture of completing projects "in time and ahead of time by bringing departments together"."Over the years, the signage --work in progress -- became a symbol of distrust in the government. People reconciled to prolonged delays in infra projects. Today, 21st century India is leaving behind old practices. The Gati Shakti Plan will give impetus to 21st century India and remove obstacles from its path," said the PM lamenting that infrastructure was never a political priority in India.He said the subject of infrastructure was not even visible in political party manifestos.“Today some parties are criticising the development of infrastructure necessary for the development of the country even though it is globally accepted that building quality infrastructure is the only route to sustainable development which also boosts economic activity and creates large scale jobs," the PM said adding that India was today working at a much faster speed than ever.Citing a study showing logistics cost in India at 13 pc of the GDP, the PM said Gati Shakti Plan would reduce these costs and lay the foundation for a self-reliant India over the next 25 years.  He said people, industry, manufacturers and farmers were at the heart of the Plan, which will bring government departments on one platform, enhancing efficiency."Gaps between macro planning and micro implementation, lack of coordination between departments and advance information to the industry, an approach of working in silos were all hampering infrastructure development and leading to budget wastage. Such an approach dissipated energies instead of harnessing them. The new plan will change this and lead to optimum utilisation of resources," said the PM citing the greater progress made under NDA-2 compared to the past 70 years.He said work was now underway to double farmers' incomes."In 2014, there were only two Mega Food Parks in the country. Today 19 are functioning and the target is to have 40 in all. There were five waterways in 2014, today we have 13. Turnaround time of vessels at ports has reduced to 27 hours today as against 41 hours in 2014," said the PM.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/taxpayers-money-wasted-in-past-no-longer-pm-launches-rs-100-lakh-cr-gati-shakti-plan-to-boost-infra-324031

13-10-2021||Boston||UN, World Bank, IMF in need of urgent reforms: Finance Minister Sitharaman||Institutions such as United Nations, World Bank and International Monetary Fund need to be urgently reformed as they no longer speak for countries whose issues have remained unattended to for decades, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.All these organisations would have to look at reforming themselves, she said at Harvard Kennedy School here on Tuesday.During the conversation with Professor at Harvard University Lawrence Summers at the talk organised by the Mossavar-Rahmani Centre for Business and Government, Sitharaman said “while reforms in countries are happening in different stages, these global institutions have remained the way they have been for the last several decades”.Many of them now no longer speak for countries whose issues have remained unattended to for decades together, whether it is on trade, security, monetary framework and on funding development, she stated.“There is a desperate need for all these institutions to be more transparent, represent and speak for countries which don't get adequate representation; and therefore I would think that is something which has to happen immediately.”When these institutions become more representative, she said there would be more equitable distribution of resources, more concern for equitable development for growth. “This whole dialogue which used to happen - north-south - looked as if it's moving towards irrelevance.“But the issues of north-south still remain. Development has not reached many parts of Africa, many parts of the small Pacific islands. Many parts of those countries, even within countries, where there is differentiated development. So I think that's what would have happened if only this reform agenda had been taken up by these institutions,” she said.Sitharaman arrived in the US on Monday for a week-long trip to attend the annual meet of the World Bank and IMF in Washingon as well as G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) meeting. During the official visit to the US, Sitharaman is expected to meet US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

Now, when its prices are high, they are looking for domestic coal, they said while accusing states like West Bengal and Jharkhand of not mining enough and not picking up stocks from Coal India.The main reasons, admitted the sources, were the prolonged monsoons and the sharp increase in foreign coal prices.The Power Ministry, in a separate missive, asked states to refrain from profiteering. “Some states are imposing load shedding and at the same time selling power in the power exchange at high price. In case any state is found to be not serving their consumers and selling in the power exchanges at a higher rate, the unallocated power shall be withdrawn and allocated to other needy states,” it warned.The PMO also asked the Coal Ministry to ramp up the supply of coal while the Railways will make available rakes for transportation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coal-stock-rising-says-centre-323778

Without a unified response, the PM warned that it would be difficult to bring about the desired change in Afghanistan.Speaking at an extraordinary G-20 virtual summit on Afghanistan where UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres complained that the international community was “moving too slowly” to prevent Afghanistan’s economic collapse, PM Modi agreed that Afghanistan must have immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance. But he pitched for a central role for the UN in providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan as per the UN Security Council Resolution 2593 on Afghanistan. This resolution is a bone of contention in the UNSC as Russia and China abstained from the Resolution, demanding that the aid should be routed through the dispensation in Kabul, the Taliban.While stating that every Indian feels the pain of Afghan people facing hunger, the PM also underlined the need to ensure that Afghan territory does not become a source of radicalisation and terrorism, regionally or globally. He emphasised the need to enhance the fight against the “nexus of radicalisation, terrorism and drug smuggling”.‘GatiShakti’ to be launched todayPrime Minister Narendra Modi will launch “PM GatiShakti”, a master plan for multi-modal connectivity, at Pragati Maidan here on Wednesday.

Nitin Gadkari floats idea||New Delhi, October 12Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari on Tuesday said that with the rollout of flex-fuel vehicles on 100 per cent bio-ethanol, the demand for ethanol will jump by four to five times.A government order mandating all vehicle manufacturers to power vehicles with flex engines (that can run on more than one fuel) is in the pipeline and likely to be issued before the end of the 2021-22 fiscal.Clean alternativeI am giving a special push for ethanol as fuel. The biggest benefit is that it is a clean fuel with very low greenhouse gas emission. —Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister“The biggest benefit of bio-ethanol as an alternative fuel is that it is clean with very low greenhouse gas emissions,” Gadkari said at a conference on “Alternative fuel-Road ahead” organised by the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).Gadkari further said that looking at the ethanol production capacity and its adoptability as a fuel, the government had redesigned and launched the E-20 fuel programme which would ensure the use of bio-ethanol in 20 per cent blend with petrol by 2025 in India.“To achieve 20 per cent ethanol blending, the country will require around 10 billion litres of ethanol by 2025. At present, the sugar industry contributes to 90 per cent of ethanol demand as a blended fuel in the country,” said the Union Minister.To increase ethanol production with available resources, Gadkari suggested to add 15-20 per cent sugar into B-Heavy Molasses. “This will have multiple benefits as it will utilise an excess stock of around 45 to 60 lakh MTs of sugar and improve the ethanol recovery by 30 per cent.” Gadkari also spoke about the need to discouraging the production of C-Heavy Molasses from sugar.“This will standardise the production of B-Heavy Molasses and will permanently lead to lesser production of sugar by 1.5 per cent per metric tonne of sugarcane,” he said, adding that these steps could boost ethanol output.The minister pointed out that the country’s import dependence on petroleum was expected to go up to the tune of Rs 15 lakh crore in the next five years.Aviation sector to benefitUnion Minister Nitin Gadkari has said bio-ethanol can be a sustainable fuel for the aviation purpose as it can provide 80 per cent savings on the greenhouse gas emissions and can be blended up to 50 per cent with conventional jet fuel without any modification. It has been already tested and approved by the Indian Air Force, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bio-ethanol-as-alternative-fuel-nitin-gadkari-floats-idea-323792

Although there is no clear evidence of children being more vulnerable to a potential third wave of the virus, countries have been expanding vaccination drives to cover children.India’s apex national body that lays down guidance for inoculations – the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation – is currently working to give guidance for Covid vaccination in children.The NTAGI is already engaged on which segments among children should be prioritised for vaccination. The guidance for ZyCoV-D use among 12 to 18 year olds is also being deliberated upon.The NTAGI will now take a combined call on vaccination for children, with Covaxin also approved today for emergency use in children.The World Health Organisation, however, has given no guidance on Covid vaccine use among children, with larger evidence suggesting a natural immunity among children to viruses.Countries are taking individual calls on the matter with the US and UK having taken the lead in inoculating children against Covid.The approval of child vaccines by the DCGI means these can be used provided the expert vaccination panel that guides Indian policy on Covid inoculation lays down the conditions for use.For instance, when the adult Covid vaccine drive was launched in January this year, it was prioritised for elderly and co-morbid populations before being further expanded.A similar policy could be followed for children to start with considering the production would be limited.It also remains to be seen how Covid shots for children will be rolled out. The adult vaccine drive is being managed by the government, with the Centre procuring 75 per cent produce from manufacturers for free distribution further to states.Covaxin is a collaboration between ICMR and Bharat Biotech.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dcgi-panel-clears-covaxin-for-emergency-use-in-kids-as-young-as-2-323580

The country must remain guarded against such moves, he added.Modi batted for correlation of rights and duties. He said they are organically related with regard to constructing a value-based society, and development of human civilisation.He said his government is focused on initiatives for the welfare of poor, small farmers and marginalised by providing them with basic amenities like houses, toilets, electricity and health care and empowering them through inclusive and participatory growth.He referred to schemes like Ujjawala, opening of Jan Dhan accounts, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi.He said the examples of development and implementation of schemes could also be seen in Jammu and Kashmir and north-easterm states.He said transparent and equitable implementation of government's policies and schemes ensures human rights. When the poor become free of worries of daily chores and struggles for basic amenities, they feel a sense of dignity and self-confidence and resultantly become mindful of their rights.He said the government had opened the doors of sectors for women to take up jobs. Laws had been strengthened to prevent atrocities and abuse of various sections of society like transgenders, children, women and the physically challenged, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-slams-selective-interpretation-of-human-rights-issues-323563
