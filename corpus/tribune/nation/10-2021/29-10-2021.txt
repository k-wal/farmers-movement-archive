29-10-2021||New Delhi||Pilots can’t withdraw resignation once tendered: Air India tells Delhi HC||Air India on Friday opposed before the Delhi High Court the reinstatement and payment of back wages to over 40 pilots, saying that unless resignation is specifically made prospective, it is effective immediately and a pilot cannot withdraw it subsequently.“Unless otherwise specified, resignation is effective immediately. There is no competence (with pilots) to withdraw on the ground that I am still serving notice period,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing Air India, told a Bench headed by Justice Rajiv Shakdher.The Bench, also comprising Justice Talwant Singh, reserved its judgement on a batch of appeals by Air India against a single judge order quashing the carrier’s decision to terminate the services of several pilots, both permanent and on contract, and directing their reinstatement.In its June 1 order, the single judge had said that the back wages, including allowances, have to be paid at par with what in-service pilots were receiving and in accordance with the government rules.The solicitor general said that there is no such “notice period” within which pilots can be said to have a right to withdraw their resignation.Once a resignation is tendered, a pilot has to continue to work for six months in terms of the Civil Aviation Requirements, in the public interest, he added.“Law stipulates that resignation comes into effect when you tender it. It is because of public interest that six months come into play. Although the relationship severs, he is supposed to work for six months. For training a pilot, a huge amount goes into it. You can’t say I won’t come from tomorrow,” the solicitor general said.The solicitor general also said that the service conditions for pilots are industry-specific and need not apply even to the ground staff.Earlier, pilots had argued that Air India’s stand could not be accepted as a resignation is prospective, which comes into effect after a mandatory six-month notice period.It was pointed out that in certain instances before the court in the present batch of appeals, the withdrawal of resignation was even accepted by Air India.The pilots had moved to the high court after Air India refused to accept the withdrawal of their resignations and terminated their employment. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pilots-cant-withdraw-resignation-once-tendered-air-india-tells-delhi-hc-331547

29-10-2021||New Delhi||Death of Kanpur trader: SC seeks Centre, UP government’s replies on plea of widow for CBI probe||The Supreme Court on Friday sought response from the Centre and Uttar Pradesh government on a plea seeking a CBI probe into the death of a Kanpur-based businessman in which six policemen have been charged with murder.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna issued notice to the Centre and UP government and sought their response.The Bench posted the matter for further hearing after the Diwali break.Advocate Amit George, appearing for the widow of the businessman, said that just after the incident, there was a press release by the office of Chief Minister Adityanath saying the government would recommend a CBI probe.“Till now CBI has not registered the case nor there is any investigation going on by the SIT constituted by the state government. Not even crime scene recreation has been done till now,” he said.The bench said it is issuing notice in the matter.Manish Gupta (36) died in a Gorakhpur hotel during a police raid. He was staying along with two friends in the hotel.Police had earlier denied the charge and said he received a head injury after he fell on the ground as he was drunk.On September 29, a case of murder has been registered against six policemen involved in the raid.The policemen booked for murder include J N Singh, Sub-Inspector Vijay Yadav, and Phalmandi police post-in-charge Akshay Mishra, Gorakhpur DM Vijay Kiran Anand said.The authorities had suspended the policemen, including the Ramgarh Taal SHO, and handed over the probe to the superintendent of police (city).In her plea filed through advocate Anand Shankar, the widow of the deceased has said that her husband’s death was a cold-blooded murder in a hotel room at Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, by certain local police officials. She said that her husband was on a visit to Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh in the last week of September 2021 and had accordingly checked into the Krishna Palace Hotel which fell with the jurisdiction of the Police Station Ramgarh Taal. On September 27, certain police officials from the Police Station, namely the Station Officer Jagat Narayan Singh, Sub-Inspectors Akshay Mishra, Vijay Yadav, and Rahul Dubey, Head Constable Kamlesh Yadav, and Constable Prashant Kumar arrived at the hotel in the late hours of the night. “In a shocking display of high-handedness and police brutality, they proceeded to viciously assault the petitioner’s husband, leading to his death. It is noteworthy that the factum of brutal violence and torture having been inflicted upon the petitioner’s husband was confirmed upon post-mortem of the dead body by the post-mortem report,” the plea said.She alleged that she was even pressurized to not mention any name of police officers and further dissuaded by high officials of the local administration and the police from taking legal recourse under the shocking rationale that a proceeding in a Court would take years and years.“However, much to the agony and grief of the petitioner, the CBI has not assumed charge of the investigation till the date of filing of the present petition, even though as on date a period of almost three weeks has already elapsed from the date of the official announcement,” she said in her plea. She said that aggrieved by the lack of initiation of appropriate action for the assumption of charge by the CBI, the petitioner has even addressed a representation to the CBI and the concerned officers of the Government of Uttar Pradesh through email, related to the CBI probe as per the recommendations made by the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh to register the FIR and carry out the desired investigation to prevent the possible destruction of evidence and ensure that the accused does not escape the hands of justice.She said that in this case, influential and well-connected local police officials are themselves complicit in the ghastly act of murder, significantly increasing the chances of the destruction of evidence and providing avenues for the accused to escape the hands of justice.“The petitioner has no faith in the investigation being carried out by the SIT considering the status and power of the accused persons and the overt actions undertaken by the local administration and police authorities to shield them initially, before ultimately grudgingly succumbing to public pressure and calls for accountability. Accordingly, the Petitioner most respectfully prays that the investigation of the present matter concerning the aforesaid ghastly incident be taken over by the CBI,” the plea said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/death-of-kanpur-trader-sc-seeks-centre-up-governments-replies-on-plea-of-widow-for-cbi-probe-331530
29-10-2021||New Delhi||Pre-Covid, two scientists wouldn’t work together, no longer: ICMR chief||Head of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the apex body coordinating the national response to Covid-19, Balram Bhargava, has said working together was the most abiding lesson from the fight against the pandemic as prior to the outbreak “two scientists wouldn’t work together”.“The most important thing that we have learnt during this pandemic in India and from the point of view of our organisation I think is working together. Earlier two scientists would not work together, two laboratories would not work together, two institutions would not work together; two organisations would not work together, two ministries would not work together. That has changed now,” Bhargava said at the launch of his book “Going Viral: The Inside Story of Covaxin”, which documents the Indian journey to the production of indigenous Covid vaccine and the unique ICMR-Bharat Biotech public-private partnership that developed the shot.Bhargava said the pandemic taught India the whole of government approach with everyone working together.“That is one of the most important things we have achieved during the pandemic. That everyone is working together. Secondly, we have learnt the need for speed. We had to work with clear cut deadlines and timelines so that we could achieve our targets,” Bhargava said, noting how India scaled up testing capacities with just one lab on January 30, 2020 when the first case of Covid was detected.As the third lesson of the pandemic, Bhargava cited “the political will and leadership that delivered and executed the world’s largest and fastest Covid vaccine drive with India administering one billion doses recently”.Bhargava said so far India has tested over 550 million samples and the national tests per million are 1500 (ten times higher than the WHO requirement).“The cost of RT-PCR test has been reduced in India by tenfold since the pandemic outbreak to USD 2 per test and the cost of rapid antigen test is just USD 1 per test. As of today, 39 per cent of Indian labs are working one shift; 29 per cent two shifts and 32 per cent three shifts to conduct nearly one to two million tests a day,” Bhargava said, adding that ICMR labs had published 10 papers on Covaxin efficacy against variants.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pre-covid-two-scientists-wouldnt-work-together-no-longer-icmr-chief-331529

Wankhede has denied all allegations.Mumbai Police, who are also probing these allegations separately, had recorded Sail’s statement over the last three days.Singh said they tried to contact Sail and also requested the Mumbai police commissioner to help as  “there were reports in the media that he is in contact with police and they are examining him.”  “We also appealed Sail through the media to come forward to record his statement and submit the evidence as we are not able to serve him notice,” the NCB official said, adding the team also contacted his relatives.   “I expect he could join the enquiry and give his valid statement as he is our most critical witness and without him it is not possible to reach any conclusion,” said Singh.The NCB team will also move a court to seek permission to question K P Gosavi, another witness in the cruise ship drugs case who is now in the custody of Pune Police in a cheating case, he said.Asked whether Aryan Khan will also be called for enquiry, Singh said every person who is needed to be questioned will be summoned, but he can not speak about any specific individual.

29-10-2021||New Delhi||COP-26: PM Modi to participate in high-level segment with 120 heads of states||Technology transfer and climate finance—the two factors essential for a “level playing field between developed and developing countries”—will form the basis of India’s pitch at the Glasgow-COP 26 that begins October 31.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who will participate in the high-level segment of COP-26 titled ‘World Leaders’ Summit (WLS) along with 120 heads of states/governments from around the world on November 1-2, said he will highlight the need to comprehensively address climate change issues, which include equitable distribution of carbon space, mobilisation of finance and technology transfer.    “I will also highlight the need to comprehensively address climate change issues including equitable distribution of carbon space, support for mitigation and adaptation and resilience-building measures, mobilisation of finance, technology transfer and importance of sustainable lifestyles for green and inclusive growth,” the prime minister said in a departure statement before leaving for Rome and Glasgow. Stating that the Summit will provide an opportunity to meet with all the stakeholders and explore possibilities for further accelerating clean growth, the PM said: “Today, India is creating new records in collective effort for climate adaptation, mitigation and resilience and forging multilateral alliances. India is among the top countries in the world in terms of installed renewable energy, wind and solar energy capacity. At the WLS, I will share India’s excellent track record on climate action and our achievements”.The upcoming COP 26 summit (October 31 to November 12) aims to review and amend promises by countries and companies worldwide to contribute to mitigation efforts. Amid a growing number of extreme climate events, there is tremendous pressure on developing nations like India to revise nationally determined commitments (NDCs), cut-off coal/fossil fuels, and declare a Net Zero target.However, with per capita carbon emissions per year  “far less than countries like the USA, EU and China”, India’s stance is that the country is doing what is required to help tackle climate change and is willing to contribute “constructively” to further efforts. However, “fossil fuels are essential for its growth plans and targets” and “what is happening today is due to historic actions of developed nations”.“India is not against enhanced targets for renewable energy and investment in several new-age green fuel technologies, but we cannot commit to phasing out coal,” officials say. India’s INDC pitch includes approximately 450-Gigawatt renewable energy by 2030, and other mitigation efforts.Officials said Indian negotiators are expected to move to establish a mechanism for ‘loss and damage’ due to climate change-related events and compensating regions most vulnerable and help them prevent and manage mishaps in the future. The country will pitch for the $100 billion per year climate financing by developed nations, which has also been specified by Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, who left for the climate summit on Friday.While India is willing to contribute “constructively, including loss and damage’ caused by extreme climate events”, the main responsibility lies with developed nations, the historic polluters, according to “polluter pays principle”, they say.The Indian team of negotiators includes representatives of several ministries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cop-26-pm-modi-to-participate-in-high-level-segment-with-120-heads-of-states-331511

It is submitted that there are both qualitative and quantitative increases in public spaces in larger vision.“For example, North and South Blocks which cover nearly 27 acres and are proposed to be converted into National Museums showcasing ‘India in making’ prehistoric to present date. The museums will be open to the public at large and serve important public purposes,” the affidavit said.The affidavit stated that the area of Plot No.1 is currently being used as government offices for almost 90 years now and no recreational activity (neighbourhood play area) exists as per actual ground conditions on Plot no. 1.“It is also averred that the place has not ever been open for the general public to utilise it for any public recreational purposes. It is also submitted that there is no residing population or residential colony in the said vicinity and only the office premises of Ministry of Defence are functioning in the said area. Hence, ‘Neighbourhood play area’ was not in existence [nor is required], and is not therefore required to be in de-jure mentioned in the Master Plan,” the affidavit said.In its consolidated reply, the Centre said considering the overall public purpose of the Central Vista and the overall vision behind the same, it has compensated and increased various public areas for the purpose of recreation and added numerous facilities in the overall Master Plan of Central Vista Project which shall be public amenities, over and above the existing ones, for the larger benefit of the public.“It is submitted that the Respondents are cognisant of the public nature of the projects and specifically seek to add various public facilities to the larger vision plan and has suo motu created a lot of space for recreational purposes. It is submitted that there are both qualitative and quantitative increase in  public spaces in larger vision,” the affidavit stated.“It is submitted that the Six plots on the Central Vista with which the present issue relates to, housed structures which were built as temporary barracks or stables during the Second World War according to the needs and requirements of that time. As of today, these structures occupy an area of over 90 acres, including L&M Block near North Block (Plot No. 1), A&B Block near South Block, Plot No.30 on Tyagraj Marg, Plot No.36 & 38, Jamnagar House and Jodhpur House,” the Centre said.The affidavit said that precious pieces of land on the Vista are highly under-utilised and these structures mostly house Defence establishments, with some offices of other Ministries.“Defence offices complexes i.e. buildings for Defence Offices have been constructed at Africa Avenue and KG Marg and the process of their shifting has already commenced. It is submitted that Hon’ble Vice President Residence has been proposed to be constructed on Plot No. 1 in Central Vista i.e. L & M Block near North Block.“It is submitted that the Plot No. 1 of Central Vista is located on Church Road near Delhi Transport Corporation Central Secretariat Bus Terminal, New Delhi. The said site falls within Central Vista Area and Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone. As per MPD-2021, the land use of the site was under Transportation (Bus Terminal/Parking) and Recreational (Neighbourhood Play) as per Zonal development of Zone-D, prepared under MPD-2001. That as a part of Redevelopment Master Plan of Central Vista, existing Vice President Residence is proposed to be relocated to the plot near North Block i.e. Plot No. 1,” the Centre said.This will in turn help ease the traffic situation in Central Vista as the movement of the Vice President will be mainly to the Parliament when in session, it said.The notified land use of the site is residential now, the affidavit said.The Centre submitted that the existing VP Residence plot shall then be made available for three Common Central Secretariat buildings which will form the Defense Enclave.The proposed VP Residence will have all necessary, updated, latest technology-based security, Access Control, IT network for communication, facilities in terms of space to meet functional requirements, it said.The affidavit submitted that all the central ministries will be relocated in the Common Central Secretariat buildings being developed on two sides of the Rajpath on the current footprints of different buildings.It contended that there will be no loss of public recreational areas.“The respondent before going further seeks to unequivocally state that the Central Vista Development/ Redevelopment Master Plan has been proposed to meet the present and future needs of space for the Parliament, Ministries/Departments; providing world class public space for interactions, recreation, better public facilities, amenities, parking, vending areas, facilities for conduct of national festivals and to infuse synergy & efficiency by integration of all the buildings of Common Central,” it said.The affidavit stated that the petition challenging the change in land use of plot number one from recreational area to residential is misconceived and liable to be dismissed with costs.The Central Vista revamp, announced in September 2019, envisages a new triangular Parliament building with a seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs that is to be constructed by August 2022 when the country will celebrate its 75th Independence Day.The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024 under the project that covers a 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in the national capital.In January this year, the apex court, by 2:1 majority, had held that the grant of environmental clearance and the notification for change in land use for construction of new Parliament building under the project was valid.The top court’s verdict had come on several pleas, including those against various permissions given to the project by authorities including the grant of environmental clearance and the nod to change of land use.The top court had in June this year dismissed a separate plea challenging the Delhi High Court order which had rejected a petition seeking to halt Central Vista construction work in view of the Covid pandemic. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/north-south-blocks-to-be-converted-into-national-museums-centre-tells-sc-331502

29-10-2021||---||Let’s wait for WHO’s decision: SC on PIL seeking international recognition of Covaxin||New Delhi, October 29The Supreme Court on Friday said that it will prefer to wait for the WHO’s decision on the recognition of Covaxin before considering a PIL seeking permission for voluntary revaccination against COVID-19 with Covishield for those fully vaccinated with Covaxin to enable them to travel abroad.A Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said it can’t play with lives of people by directing the government to permit those already fully vaccinated with Covaxin to get revaccinated with Covershield.The apex court was hearing a petition that said that Covaxin was not approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and people here are facing difficulty in getting permission to travel abroad.A Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said that the court does not have any data of what will be the effect on the people and it cannot simply direct the Centre to re-vaccinate people with Covishield.“We cannot play with the lives of people by directing the Centre to revaccinate. We don’t have any data with us. We have read in newspapers that Bharat Biotech has filed an application with the WHO for recognition. Let’s wait for the WHO authorisation and have it after Diwali. Let us wait for a little while,” the Bench said.Petitioner advocate Kartik Seth said students and others who wanted to go abroad were denied entry to foreign countries as Covaxin was not recognised by the WHO. At the time of rolling out of Covaxin, the Centre didn’t make the public aware that it wasn’t approved by the WHO.As WHO approval remains pending, several countries such as the US, the UK, Germany, Canada etc. have been treating Indians vaccinated with Covaxin as un-vaccinated, he contended. He demanded that Covexin-administered people should be allowed to get re-vaccinated after three months of the second dose, since Covaxin hasn’t been approved by the WHO for emergency use for the last five months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lets-wait-for-whos-decision-sc-on-pil-seeking-international-recognition-of-covaxin-331495

29-10-2021||Surat||Defamation case: Rahul Gandhi appears before Surat court to record statement||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday appeared before a magistrate’s court here to record his statement in a criminal defamation case filed against him over his remark about the “Modi surname” during a campaign rally in 2019.He had appeared before the court twice earlier.During Friday’s hearing, the Congress leader replied “I don’t know” to most of the questions asked by the court on the basis of recent testimonies of two witnesses—the then electoral officer of Kolar in Karnataka where Gandhi had made the speech, and a videographer appointed by the Election Commission to shoot that rally.Gandhi claimed ignorance and said “I don’t know” when Chief Judicial Magistrate A N Dave asked if he knew about the appointment of Arun Kumar as official videographer to shoot the rally.He gave the same reply when asked about other technical details such as storage of that video in a computer.The Congress leader had earlier appeared before the court on June 24 this year. The magistrate asked him to remain present again on October 29 after the statements of the other two witnesses were recorded.He had appeared before the court first in October 2019 and pleaded not guilty.Local BJP MLA Purnesh Modi—now a Minister in the Gujarat government—filed the case against Gandhi under Indian Penal Code sections 499 and 500 which deal with defamation in October 2019.He alleged that Gandhi, addressing a poll rally, defamed the entire Modi community by saying “how come all the thieves have Modi as the common surname?” In his speech at the rally in Kolar on April 13, 2019, ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, the then Congress president had reportedly asked, “Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi, Narendra Modi...how come they all have Modi as the common surname”. On Friday, Purnesh Modi’s lawyers filed an application seeking to call one Chandrappa, the then head of the Video Viewing Team, as a witness. The magistrate said he would decide the plea on Saturday. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defamation-case-rahul-gandhi-appears-before-surat-court-to-record-statement-331491
29-10-2021||October 29||Senior aide to Myanmar’s Suu Kyi sentenced to 20 years in prison||Win Htein, a senior aide to Myanmar’s ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi, was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Friday on charges of high treason, media and one of his family members said.Win Htein, 79, is a stalwart supporter of Suu Kyi and a long-time political prisoner during decades campaigning to end army rule.He was arrested in the aftermath of a Feb. 1 coup that has plunged Myanmar into chaos and that ended a decade of tentative democratic rule.Win Htein’s daughter, Chit Suu Win Htein, said in a message to Reuters: “So this is as we expected. It’s not a surprise but it’s a sad and outrageous thing to hear about the ridiculous sentencing. Perpetrators of this injustice will be held accountable for this ...  Please hold on people! We will win!” Suu Kyi, who is also on trial, is charged with a litany of offences, including breaking coronavirus protocols, illegally possessing two-way radios, accepting bribes of cash and gold, incitement to cause public alarm and violating the Official Secrets Act.In her first court testimony on Tuesday she denied a charge of incitement in connection with her party publishing a letter in February calling on international organisations not to cooperate with the ruling military junta.Myanmar’s state media has not reported developments in Suu Kyi’s multiple legal cases, and one of the only sources of public information on her trial—her lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw—received a gagging order from the military authorities earlier this month.That was after Myanmar’s former president Win Myint said during his court testimony that the military had tried to force him to relinquish power hours before the coup, in comments which challenged the military’s insistence that no coup took place.The military has said it took power because elections last year that returned Suu Kyi’s party to office were flawed—an assertion the country’s electoral commission has dismissed.Before she was deposed, Suu Kyi led a civilian government after her party swept a 2015 election, called when the military stepped back from half a century of direct rule.The coup ended years of tentative steps towards democracy and economic growth in Myanmar after decades of authoritarian rule and economic stagnation.—     Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/senior-aide-to-myanmars-suu-kyi-sentenced-to-20-years-in-prison-331490

The attack on Hindu society in Bangladesh is not a sudden event. An attempt was made to create communal frenzy on the basis of fake news. It was a planned attempt to eradicate the Hindu society there,” Arun Kumar said.Strongly condemning the “conspiracy of jihadi organisations for violence and widespread Islamisation of Bangladesh”, the resolution states that “the real purpose of repeated violence targeting Hindu society is the complete extermination of Hindu society from Bangladesh”.“The population of Hindus has been decreasing continuously since the time of the Partition. At that time the population of Hindus in East Bengal was about 28 per cent which has now come down to about eight per cent.“Atrocities by radical Islamic groups like Jamaat-e-Islami (Bangladesh) forced a large number of Hindus to migrate to India since the Partition, especially during the 1971 war,” it stated, expressing concern over the “silence of the concerned organisations”.The RSS also called upon the international community to come forward to condemn this violence and raise its voice “for the protection and security of Hindus, Buddhists and other minority communities in Bangladesh”.“The rise of radical Islamic power in Bangladesh or any other part of the world will prove to be a serious threat to the democratic system and human rights of peace loving countries of the world,” the resolution stated, appreciating the work done by organisations like ISKCON, Ramakrishna Mission, Bharat Sevashram Sangh, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and other Hindu organisations and institutions to help the victims of the violence.The executive board also urged the government to use all available diplomatic channels to apprise the government of Bangladesh about “the concerns of Hindu societies and institutions around the world regarding invasion of human rights and abuse in Bangladesh so that Hindus, Buddhists can be protected,” said Arun Kumar briefing about the developments at the second day of the meeting at  Dharwad.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-condemns-attacks-on-hindus-in-bangladesh-calls-it-a-planned-effort-to-eradicate-community-331489
29-10-2021||New Delhi||Told Pakistan action against terrorism will be taken on their side of border if needed: Rajnath||India has clearly told Pakistan that action against terrorism will be taken not only on this side of the border but also on their side if needed, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on Friday.“People used to say that if Article 370 is abolished, then the entire Kashmir will burn...All in all, Jammu and Kashmir is peaceful except for a few incidents,” he said at an event here.Rajouri and Poonch in Jammu region have witnessed a rise in infiltration attempts since June this year, resulting in the killing of nine terrorists in separate encounters.The Centre had on August 5, 2019, abolished Article 370 of the Constitution that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir.Singh said, “It is true that our enemy forces are fidgety. I can say with surety that terrorists’ confidence has been broken in Kashmir Valley.”                Since October 11, the Indian Army is conducting a massive search operation to track down hiding terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir’s twin border districts of Poonch and Rajouri.Pakistan was not able to gather any support on the topic of Kashmir even after trying a lot, the minister said.“Modiji has redesigned and redefined India’s attitude against terrorism. Remember, what a soft attitude was maintained against terrorists during earlier governments,” Singh told the gathering.If there were terrorist incidents, there was talk of giving “safe passage” to them, there used to be talk of playing or not playing matches against Pakistan, he said.“Now the situation has changed. Our government has said clearly that terrorism and talks cannot go hand in hand. For the last few years, we have stopped having any talks with Pakistan,” the minister mentioned.“Now we don’t talk about playing or not playing (cricket) matches. Instead, we have stated it clearly that action against terrorism will be taken—on this side of the border as well as on the other side of the border if needed,” he added.

29-10-2021||New Delhi||Varun Gandhi demands legal guarantee for MSP||Launching an attack on the Uttar Pradesh government over the issues of farmers, BJP MP Varun Gandhi alleged on Friday that "crippling corruption" in procurement centres is completely out in the open and that they are forced to sell their grains to middlemen. He also demanded a legal guarantee for the minimum support price (MSP), also one of the demands of farmer unions protesting against three farm laws, saying farmers will continue to be exploited in 'mandis' (markets for agricultural produce) as long as this is not done. Gandhi sought stringent action in the matter. He also posted a video of him speaking apparently to a government official at a mandi in Bareilly. Raising the issue of hardship facing farmers, Gandhi is heard saying that it is a matter of "big shame" for the state government. The "nexus" between officials and middlemen to force farmers to sell their grains at a much lower price than stipulated is visible across the country, he alleged. He is also heard warning the official that if his representative records any evidence of corruption or ill-treatment to farmers, then he will not make any request to the government but instead move court and get such officials arrested. "At every procurement centre in the state there is crippling corruption which is completely out in the open. Farmers' grains are forcibly rejected after which they sell their produce out of desperation to middlemen. The administration takes a cut," he alleged. He added,"With farmers already facing steep input costs, lack of fertilisers and inclement weather, saddling him with a system that ensures he sells at a loss is going to drive the next generation away from agriculture and threaten both our food and national security. It will also lead to social unrest and create fissures where none need exist." — PTIजब तक एमएसपी की वैधानिक गारंटी नहीं होगी, ऐसे ही मंडियों में किसानों का शोषण होता रहेगा। इस पर सख़्त से सख़्त कार्यवाही होनी चाहिए। pic.twitter.com/pWKI13e4Vp||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/varun-gandhi-demands-legal-guarantee-for-msp-331480

Banerjee's tour is being seen as an attempt by her to gauge political mood in the state ahead of the Assembly polls slated in early 2022. During her maiden interaction with the TMC leaders in Goa, Banerjee accused the BJP of defacing her posters in the state and said people of India will deface the saffron party. "When I come to Goa, they deface my posters. You will be defaced from India," she said. "You deface us (our posters), show black flags, refuse to grant permission (to hold event) because you know that TMC will due but will never compromise," she said while targeting the ruling BJP in Goa. Banerjee said that if the TMC comes to power in Goa, it will not work with the agenda of revenge, but work for the state. Listing out various welfare schemes rolled out by her government in her home state, she said if the TMC can do it in West Bengal, the it can also do it the small state of Goa. "I will be happy to do it. I am not going to be the chief minister of Goa, but I will see that there is policy, mechanism and no corruption in the government," she said. Banerjee said the TMC is a national party and it can go anywhere. "We will work for Goa in a strong manner. It is not that we want to divide votes. You have given opportunity to all parties, now give opportunity to the TMC," she said  She said the initial three letters in her party's name TMC also stand for temple, mosque and church. "BJP calls me anti-Hindu, but they are no one to give me character certificate. They should first decide their own character certificate," the 66-year-old leader said. Stating that the TMC doesn't divide people on the basis of religions - be they are Hindus, Muslims or Christians, Banerjee said, "We unite people."  She narrated how she has been associated with the all the religions by way of festivals and rituals.Recalling her stint as a Union minister earlier, the TMC chief said she has travelled the country."I know India very well," she said.Calling the TMC a transparent party, she said, "If you trust us, the party will give its fullest to back to you...Goa will not be run from Delhi."  Banerjee said her party wants to make Goa strong and self-sufficient and also protect the state's cultural heritage.Referring to the Congress, she said the party has contested elections for 60-70 years."Last time (in 2017 Goa polls), you (Congress) allowed the BJP to form the government.

We will make UP number one state", he promised while launching the special membership drive."There should be a 'toran' with the slogan on every house," he told cadres, also telling them to ask people their problems and expectations from the Modi-Yogi governments."The party's manifesto will be prepared on the feedback you bring from people," Shah told party leaders and cadres. He also "promised" people that the BJP would fulfill all the commitments in UP.Claiming that the BJP government had fulfilled 90 per cent of promises made in the 2017 manifesto, Shah said the remaining 10 per cent would also be completed by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in the next two months.Amid speculations of differences between the two, Shah praised Adityanath for law and order in the state saying that 'palayan' had stopped completely and now there are no 'bahubalis' in the state. "The biggest work that Yogi Adityanath has done is getting rid of mafias," he said.Listing the welfare works by the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and the Adityanath government in the state, Shah expressed confidence that the BJP would cross the mark of 300 seats in 2022 and Adityanath would return to power.Invoking the Ram Mandir, Shah asked, “Did anyone even imagine there will be a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya" and reminded Samajwadi leader Akhilesh Yadav of his jibe, 'Mandir wahin baneyenge, tithi nahi batayenge'.Slamming the Samajwadi Party and BSP as "barsati" politicians, he called them "family-based parties which think only of themselves".He also flagged off the campaign vehicles to various districts.The senior BJP leader is in UP to review the party’s strategy in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh ahead of the Assembly elections next year.Shah is expected to hold separate meetings with Adityanath, key state leaders and office-bearers on election preparations and other issues.The BJP currently has 312 seats in the 403-member UP Assembly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-will-cross-the-300-mark-in-up-this-time-says-amit-shah-331465

Yesterday, Israel's Ambassador publicly stated that Pegasus spyware was sold only to government. So, in India's case, the buyer was certainly the Government of India," Chidambaram tweeted.Will the Minister for Telecommunications admit that the buyer of Pegasus was the Government of India, he asked."If he remains silent, the blot on his report card will remain," Chidambaram said.Israel's newly-appointed Ambassador to India Naor Gilon said on Thursday that Israel does not allow companies like NSO to sell their products to non-governmental actors."...Every export of NSO or such companies needs an export licence of the Israeli government. We grant this export licence only for exporting to governments," he had said."This is the only main requirement...Under the requirements, they cannot sell it to non-governmental actors.

But observing that induction of women to the NDA could not be postponed by a year, the apex court had allowed women candidates to take the exam in November this year and not wait till May 2022 as requested by the government.In his speech, the army chief also appealed to the cadets to stay abreast of the new technology to counter the contemporary challenges.He said he was greatly honoured to review the parade."A little over 42 years back, when I stood as a cadet at the same drill square as you stand today, little could have I imagined that I would be reviewing this parade," he said."From here on, you will step into the respective career service academies for more focused military training.

Wankhede was a senior officer of the Narcotics Control Bureau and not a “drug peddler”, the lawyer said.Besides a direction to the police not to arrest him, the petition sought that the allegations against him be probed by an independent agency such as the CBI or the NIA.Wankhede feared that the Mumbai police’s probe against him was likely to be biased and unfair, it said.A “decorated officer” of the NCB was being subjected to “public vilification” following Aryan Khan’s arrest, the petition said.“Ever since the said investigation (into Khan’s case) has commenced, the petitioner has been systematically made target of public vilification and harassment by vested interests using the powerful medium of persons holding public office in the very government of the day,” it said.The police’s probe against him was “occasioned due to a clear programme by the respondent state (Maharashtra government) to implicate the petitioner in false cases”, the petition alleged. — PTIPolice complaint against Malik||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wont-arrest-ncb-zonal-head-sameer-wankhede-without-notice-mumbai-cops-tell-hc-331110

Tytler is the second top Congress leader suspected for his role in the 1984 riots after Sajjan Kumar, who stands convicted for life and is serving jail term for his involvement in the riots.In the Tytler case, the CBI filed closure reports in 2007, 2009 and 2014. But Delhi’s Karkardooma courts rejected the CBI closure report on December 4, 2015, following a petition by Lakhwinder Kaur, who lost her husband in Gurdwara Pul Bangash attack.

He thinks it is just a matter of time when people will throw Modi away,” Kishor said, attending an interface with residents of Goa.He said it was important to acknowledge the strengths of adversaries to defeat them, rather than just wait for the time when a fatigued electorate would vote out the party. “The BJP is going to be at the centre of Indian polity… whether they win, whether they lose …like it was for the first 40 years for the Congress,” Kishor said.Rahul’s belief wrongThe problem with Rahul Gandhi is he thinks it’s a matter of time before people throw away PM Modi, that’s not happening.

A joint statement issued after the virtual summit would help both sides chart the way forward in the implementation of the convergences that exist between the AOIP and IPOI, said MEA’s Secretary (East) Riva Ganguly Das.The seven central pillars of the AOIP are maritime security, maritime ecology, maritime resources, capacity building, disaster risk reduction, S&T cooperation and trade connectivity.“India’s IPO and ASEAN’s Outlook for the Indo-Pacific are the framework for our shared vision and mutual cooperation,” the PM said.He underlined the centrality of ASEAN in India’s vision for a free, open, inclusive and rules-based Indo-Pacific region. He assured ASEAN of India’s support, exemplified most recently through the contribution of medical supplies worth $200,000 for Myanmar and $1 million for ASEAN’s Covid response fund.The MEA Secretary said the PM highlighted the importance of greater physical and digital connectivity between ASEAN and India and called for an early review of the ASEAN-India trade in goods agreement, which had been pending for a long time.Focus on strong tiesWe all had to deal with many challenges due to the pandemic…but our mutual cooperation will continue to strengthen our relationship and will be the basis of goodwill among our people.

29-10-2021||New Delhi||New law won’t affect boundary pacts: China||Responding primarily to concerns flagged by India, China on Thursday said its new land boundary law would not affect the existing treaties on this issue with other countries.“The law won’t also change China’s current mode of boundary management and cooperation with countries sharing land boundary with it. Nor will it alter China’s position and proposition on relevant boundary issues,” said Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Wang Wenbing at a briefing. Asked to respond specifically to Indian MEA’s concerns, Wang said, “I just shared China’s consideration behind promulgating the law. We hope relevant countries will abide by norms of international relations and refrain from wanton speculations on China’s normal domestic legislation.”The law had clear provisions on conducting cooperation with countries sharing a national land boundary with China and handling boundary affairs on the basis of adhering to relevant treaties related to national land boundary affairs and the principle of equality and mutual benefit, said Wang on being asked the rationale for the National People’s Congress of China approving the National Land Boundary Law on October 23.A day earlier, the Ministry of External Affairs said China’s “unilateral decision” to bring about a legislation could have implications on the existing bilateral arrangements on border management as well as on the boundary question. MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi also said the law did not confer any legitimacy to the so-called China Pakistan Boundary Agreement of 1963, which India had consistently maintained was illegal and invalid. Under the agreement, Pakistan had surrendered 5,300 km of territory to China in the Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK) region.The Chinese MFA said the law stipulates the leadership system and division of duties among different departments as well as between military and civilian authorities. “This is an important measure China has taken to implement rule of law and normal domestic legislative activity. It is in keeping with the practical needs in China’s national boundary work and consistent with international law and practice,” he added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-law-wont-affect-boundary-pacts-china-331011

He is, however, not likely to walk out of the jail immediately as the court is yet to give its operative order on the conditions imposed while granting bail.Justice NW Sambre also granted bail to co-accused Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha. “All three applications are allowed. I will pass detailed order by tomorrow evening,” Justice Sambre said.Aryan Khan’s advocates sought permission to submit cash bail to which the court refused and said surety is to be given. “I could have given the order tomorrow also. But I gave it today,” Justice Sambre said.The legal team of 23-year-old Aryan Khan will now try to complete the formalities for his release by Friday or Saturday. Gosavi, whose selfie and video with Aryan Khan had gone viral, was produced in a court that remanded him in police custody till November 5. Recently, Prabhakar Sail, another witness in the Aryan Khan case, had claimed that he had overheard Gosavi telling one Sam D’Souza on the phone about a demand of Rs 25 crore, and “to settle at Rs 18 crore as they have to give Rs 8 crore to Sameer Wankhede”, the Zonal Director of the NCB who supervised the raid on the cruise ship.On Monday, Gosavi had refuted Sail’s claim and said he would surrender before the Lucknow police.

29-10-2021||Beijing||New land border law will not affect existing boundary treaties: China on India’s concerns||China said on Thursday that its new land border law will not affect the implementation of existing border treaties and urged relevant countries to avoid making “wanton speculation” about a “normal domestic legislation”, a day after India raised concerns over the legislation.China’s national legislature - the National People’s Congress (NPC) - on October 23 adopted the new law on the protection and exploitation of the land border areas which drew sharp reaction from India as it was passed amid the protracted military standoff between the two sides in eastern Ladakh region.India and Bhutan are the two countries with which China is yet to finalise the border agreements, while Beijing resolved the boundary disputes with 12 other neighbours.While the India-China border dispute covers 3,488-km along the Line of Actual Control, the China-Bhutan row covers about 400 km.On Wednesday, India hit out at Beijing for bringing out the new land border law and said it expects China to avoid taking any action under the “pretext” of the legislation that could “unilaterally” alter the situation in the border areas.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi described China’s decision to bring out the law as a matter of “concern” as it can have implications on the existing bilateral pacts on the management of the border and the overall boundary question.“China’s unilateral decision to bring about a legislation which can have implication on our existing bilateral arrangements on border management as well as on the boundary question is of concern to us,” he said.“Such unilateral move will have no bearing on the arrangements that both sides have already reached earlier, whether it is on the boundary question or for maintaining peace and tranquillity along the LAC in India-China border areas,” he said.Responding to questions on the Land Border Law, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said, “The law has clear provisions on conducting cooperation with countries sharing a national land boundary with China and handling boundary affairs on the basis of adhering to relevant treaties related to national land boundary affairs and the principle of equality and mutual benefit.”In an apparent response to India’s concerns, he said, “It will not affect China’s compliance with existing treaties related to national land boundary affairs China has already signed or change China’s current mode of boundary management and cooperation with countries sharing a land boundary with it. Nor will it alter China’s position and proposition on relevant boundary issues.”To a specific question about India’s criticism of the law, Wang said, “I just shared China’s consideration behind promulgating the National Land Boundary Law. We hope relevant countries will abide by norms of international relations and refrain from wanton speculations on China’s normal domestic legislation”.He, however, did not respond to Bagchi’s remark that the “new law does not in our view confer any legitimacy to the so-called China Pakistan “Boundary Agreement” of 1963 which the Government of India has consistently maintained is an illegal and invalid agreement.”Under the agreement, Pakistan had surrendered approximately 5,300 km of territory to China in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK) region.Earlier, elaborating on the provisions of the new law adopted by the NPC last week, Wang said President Xi Jinping signed a decree No. 99 on the same day announcing that the law will come into effect from January 1, 2022.“This law consists of seven chapters and 62 articles. It stipulates clearly the leadership system and division of duties among different departments as well as between military and civilian authorities,” he said.“It also offers clear provisions regarding delineation and demarcation of national land boundaries, defence and management of national land boundaries and borders, and international cooperation in national land boundary affairs,” he said.“China has a land boundary of approximately 22,000 km, with 14 countries. The main purpose for formulating and promulgating this law is to further coordinate, regulate and strengthen boundary management and advance international cooperation in relevant fields,” he said.Defending China’s move to promulgate the law, he said, “This is an important measure China has taken to implement rule of law and a normal domestic legislative activity. It is in keeping with the practical needs in China’s national boundary work and consistent with international law and practice.”India and China over the years have worked out a host of agreements to resolve and handle the border differences. These include the Special Representatives mechanism, the Agreement on Political Parameters and Guiding Principles of 2005, the WMCC (Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs) besides protocols and CBMs to ensure peace and tranquillity along the LAC.India and China have already held 22 rounds of border talks under the framework of the Special Representatives dialogue which was set up to find an early solution to the border dispute.Both sides have been maintaining that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.In his statement, the MEA Spokesperson had also said India expects that China will avoid undertaking action under the pretext of this law which could unilaterally alter the situation in the India-China border areas.China promulgated new land boundary law in the midst of a 17-month border standoff between the two countries in eastern Ladakh.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.The tension escalated following a deadly clash in Galwan Valley on June 15 last year.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in February and in the Gogra area in August.The last round of military talks on October 10 ended in a stalemate following which both sides blamed each other for the impasse.

Treat this as a moot court. We have 10 minutes to rise for lunch. You must have read the brief. Please argue. We know you can argue. You must avail the opportunity of arguing the matter whenever your senior is absent. A lawyer without a brief is like a Sachin Tendulkar without his bat on the cricket ground,” the bench said.A moot court is where law students argue imaginary cases for practice.The top court then asked the lawyer what he does in the chambers and whether he reads the case files.“You must always read the case files and be ready with the briefs whenever you are to appear before the court. Now, please start arguing. We will help you. You can start with the synopsis,” the top court told the young lawyer.When the young lawyer started reading the synopsis of the case which was related to some dispute about taxation, the bench frequently asked the meaning of certain words and even went on to explain the meaning of it to the young lawyer.When the lawyer read the word ‘cogent’ the bench asked the meaning of it which he failed to answer.“Take out your mobile phone. Now, Google the meaning of cogent and tell us what it is”, the bench said and added that it is rational, convincing, or compelling.In a rare scene, the bench went on to explain the meaning of several such words like ‘Merchant Trade Taxation’, ‘entity’, and others.The bench even asked him whether the Jabalpur bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court is a principal seat or a bench and what is the difference between the bench and the principal seat.“Now, we are rising for lunch. Utilise this time in reading the case file and you will argue the case”, the bench told the young lawyer.The matter was argued by senior lawyers in post-lunch sessions assisted by the young lawyer and the bench reserved its verdict.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lawyer-without-brief-is-like-sachin-tendulkar-without-his-bat-on-cricket-ground-sc-330991
29-10-2021||New Delhi||India proposes reciprocal Covid vaccine certification mechanism to its partners: Shringla||India has proposed a mutually acceptable Covid-19 vaccine certification framework to its partner countries to ensure a simplified international travel regime and several of them have already agreed to it, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Thursday.The mechanism is based on reciprocal recognition of the integrity of the vaccine certification process by the partner countries and it will help in normalising international travel, he said at a media briefing.On the delay in the grant of Emergency Use Listing (EUL) for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin by the World Health Organisation, Shringla said India is hopeful of getting the approval soon.The foreign secretary said the regulatory body concerned of the WHO put some questions to Bharat Biotech and approval for the vaccine should come if the queries are responded to effectively.“India has proposed to its partner countries, primarily countries that Indian citizens normally travel to, that we should have a mutual (mechanism) that you recognise our vaccine certification and we will mutually recognise your vaccine certification,” Shringla said.“Now the advantage of this is that as we keep adding new vaccines to our stock of national vaccines, you do not need to go to every country to try and get recognition. You recognise the certification that we issue, you recognise its integrity and we will give you mutual treatment,” he said.The foreign secretary said a number of countries have already agreed to the proposal. He, however, did not name the countries.“So we have achieved some reciprocal arrangements with a number of countries. We are working with all of our partner countries to have similar arrangements. It will simplify international travel, it will normalise international travel,” Shringla said.He said such a mechanism could be helpful in the G20’s objective of recovering from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.“Business travellers, tourists which contribute to the recovery of economies will be greatly benefitted from this simplified international travel regime that we are proposing and we have taken it up with the G20, we have taken it up bilaterally, we have taken it up in plurilateral forums,” he said.“We will continue to advocate this as a means of better and easier access to citizens travelling all over the world,” Shringla added.To a question on delay in WHO’s nod for Covaxin, he said the regulatory committee of the global body in its meeting on October 26 asked certain questions to Bharat Biotech and the manufacturer will soon provide its response.“It is a technical and regulatory group. The emergency authorisation by the WHO is based on technical considerations and we are carefully following up the discussions at the WHO. We are hopeful that Covaxin will get approval soon,” Shringla said.On India proposing waivers by the World Trade Organisation on Covid-related medical products including vaccines, he said India is for ensuring affordable and equitable access to Covid-19 disease control tools.“We have advocated for technology transfer and diversification of supply chain and production hubs to ensure affordable and equitable access to Covid-19 disease control tools,” he said.“I am happy to share that G20 has recognised extensive vaccination as a global public good and I think that is where discussions in the G20 will be relevant,” he added.

So, do not ever get into this trap that people are getting angry and they will throw away (PM Narendra) Modi,” he added.“Maybe, they will throw away Modi, but BJP is not going anywhere. They are going to be here, you have to fight it out for the next many decades. It’s not going in a hurry,” Kishor said.Referring to Rahul Gandhi, he said, “That is where the problem lies with Rahul Gandhi. Probably, he thinks it’s just a matter of time that people will throw him (Modi) away. That’s not happening.”Kishor had helped craft the election strategies for the TMC and the DMK in the Assembly polls in West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, respectively, held earlier this year. These parties had emerged victorious in those states.The TMC has announced that it would be contesting the Assembly elections in Goa due in February next year. TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee is beginning her three-day visit to Goa from Thursday.Slamming the TMC after Kishor’s remarks, Goa Pradesh Congress Committee chief Girish Chodankar said, “Since last one month TMC landed in Goa. I have always said that @AmitShah and #ED were behind sending TMC to Goa. Now, their strategist whose services are hired has confirmed my apprehensions when he said BJP is here to stay. #TMC is here to divide the votes. TMC Agenda stands exposed.” Later, he also issued a statement in which he said that time and again, he has been saying that Amit Shah and the ED were behind the ‘Operation Goa’ of the TMC to divide secular votes and give mileage to the BJP.“Prashant Kishor is neither a politician nor does he have any ideology. Whoever hires him, he works for them,” the Congress leader said, adding that his attack on Rahul Gandhi proves the point.Another local Congress leader, Rakhi Prabhudesai Naik, said in a tweet, “If #TMC strategist thinks that BJP is not going anywhere then the party should pack it’s bags from #Goa. Rather than dividing the votes, they should go back to #WB. Or else, it will confirm that their presence here is a BJP game-plan.” —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-wont-go-anywhere-for-next-many-decades-says-prashant-kishor-takes-swipe-at-rahul-gandhi-330962

Every export of NSO or such companies needs an export licence of the Israeli government. We grant this export licence only for exporting to governments,” he said.“This is the only main requirement...Under the requirements, they cannot sell it to non-governmental actors. What’s happening here in India is an internal thing for India and I would rather not go into your internal matters,” Gilon said.He was replying to questions over allegations of unauthorised surveillance using NSO Group’s spyware Pegasus and whether the Indian government contacted Israel over the issue.An international investigative consortium had claimed that many Indian ministers, politicians, activists, businessmen and journalists were potentially targeted by the NSO Group’s phone hacking software.The Supreme Court has set up a three-member independent expert panel to probe the alleged use of Pegasus for targeted surveillance in India, observing the state cannot get a “free pass” every time the spectre of national security is raised.Asked about the new quadrilateral grouping comprising India, Israel, the US and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the envoy said it is focused on cooperation in areas of the economy, trade, infrastructure and technology among others and that there is “no military element” to it.               When referred to India’s close ties with Iran and whether it will impact the cooperation under the grouping, he said it is to promote something positive and not to create something negative against anyone.“Our cooperation is to promote something positive, it is not to create something negative against someone else,” he said.“We are very much aware that India has its own interests when it comes to Afghanistan and Iran....I think that in discussions between countries, especially between friends, each country puts forward its own concerns and each country has its own interests, and then you see over time how it circles down, how it comes out,” the envoy said.At the same time, he said the biggest threat Israel has been facing is from Iran, alleging that the country has been a source of instability in the Gulf region.Gilon said Israel is keen to expand its cooperation with India in areas of economy and trade and said the proposed free trade agreement between the two sides is expected to increase the volume of economic engagement.He said the FTA is expected to be finalised by June next year.The envoy also said Israel is cooperating with Indian agencies probing the bombing outside the Israeli embassy in the national capital earlier this year.“We don’t know yet the identity of the perpetrators. It is an ongoing investigation. I hope we will get to them as soon as possible,” he said.The envoy said Israel’s cooperation with India in areas of agriculture, water and irrigation sharing is on an upswing.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar paid a visit to Israel this month during which he held talks with Israel’s top leadership to further expand the strategic ties between the two countries.

His selfies and videos with Aryan have appeared on social media.He has been called an "independent witness" by the NCB, which is probing the drugs case in which nearly 20 people were arrested.The Pune police had earlier arrested Gosavi's assistant Sherbano Kureshi in the cheating case, filed by one Chinmay Deshmukh, who had alleged that Gosavi cheated him of Rs 3.09 lakh under the pretext of providing him a job in the hotel industry in Malaysia. Kureshi had received the money in her account.The case was registered at Faraskhana police station here.Earlier, a lookout circular was also issued by the police to prevent Gosavi from leaving the country.
