So something new needs to be done. But how to reach an amicable settlement, that is something on which people are working on the matter. Whenever there is any water dispute, then the judiciary is also involved”, the Governor told reporters here.The Governor’s statement came a day after the Supreme Court directed the supervisory committee to take a “firm decision” on the maximum water level to be maintained in Mullaperiyar dam.The apex court has directed all the authorities concerned to interact immediately on an urgent basis on the issue saying it has something to do with lives.The top court had told Kerala’s counsel that their officers should responsibly interact with the concerned officers of Tamil Nadu and the committee on the issue.Responding to queries in the Assembly on Monday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had slammed social media scaremongers claiming “danger” to Mullaperiyar dam and warned of legal action against such elements.The CM had also told the state Assembly that the government is committed to its demand for a new dam at Mullaperiyar despite opposition, including from the Centre.Mullaperiyar dam, built in 1895 on Periyar river in Idukki district of Kerala, is operated by the Tamil Nadu government for its irrigation and power generation needs.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mullaperiyar-dam-kerala-asks-tamil-nadu-to-maintain-water-at-137-feet-330005

The cruise drugs case impacted him momentarily but it has not dented his enormous popularity with the masses...it is not surprising that Shah Rukh is back in visible circulation,” Indian Institute of Human Brands Chief Mentor Sandeep Goyal said.Another senior executive at an advertising firm said brands leveraging Khan have lots to gain, given his personality and charm that audience across age groups love.Khan is a popular choice for brands. He has endorsed several brands in the past, including Dish TV, Hyundai, Pepsi, D’decor and others.Confectionery major Mondelez India has released the second edition of its festive campaign featuring the actor recently.The Bollywood heartthrob is seen batting for the local traders this Diwali in the latest “Iss Diwali Aap #KiseKhushKarenge?” campaign.This is the first major campaign by the Bollywood star after his son was arrested by the authorities in the drugs case.Mondelez India Senior Director (Marketing) Anil Viswanathan said the launch of the new campaign was a way of lending support to local ventures, helping them build resilience, especially after the pandemic.“It is the success of our first edition that inspired us to further take our purpose of generosity at the heart of these businesses and make their 2021 Diwali even more joyful, and we are thrilled to onboard the nation’s most beloved and talented actor, Shah Rukh Khan as the face of the current campaign,” he added.Edtech company Byju’s, which had suspended ads featuring the actor after the controversy, has also resumed its campaigns.The company was heavily trolled on social media for having the actor as its ambassador, given that its campaigns talk about a better future for children.Byju’s did not respond to queries on the reason for suspending and resuming the ads again.Khan isn’t alone when it comes to celebrities landing in controversy and brands having had to make difficult choices on whether or not to continue their engagement. Aamir Khan saw his deal with Snapdeal being terminated after he made a controversial remark.Khan is also back in the advertisement of Vimal Pan Masala and LG Electronics.According to Duff & Phelps Celebrity Brand Valuation Study 2020, Khan has a brand valuation of USD 51.1 million. He was ranked fourth after cricketer Virat Kohli, who was on the top of the list, followed by Bollywood actors Akshay Kumar and Ranveer Singh.SRK is also popular on social media platforms, with 42.1 million followers on Twitter and 26.8 million followers on Instagram. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ads-featuring-shah-rukh-khan-coming-back-after-a-pause-329991
26-10-2021||Mumbai||Anti-Wankhede people threatening us, trolling us, we’re living in fear: Wife||The wife of under-fire NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede on Tuesday came out in strong support of her husband and said they were getting threat calls, facing vicious trolling online and living in fear as she rejected allegations levelled against him by Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik.Talking to the media in suburban Andheri, Kranti Redkar, who is an actress, described her husband as an honest government officer and also refuted the extortion attempt claims made by an NCB witness in the Mumbai cruise drugs case which is being supervised by Wankhede.Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan is among 20 persons arrested in connection with the case, which relates to the alleged seizure of drugs from a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast early this month.Redkar claimed a section is working against her husband.“My husband is an honest officer and doing his duty with sincerity for the last 15 years. Sameer is not attached to any political party, he is a central government employee and doing his work, some people are having a problem from his work due to which everything (row related to allegations against  Wankhede) is happening,” she said.“People who are against Sameer have been threatening us, saying they will burn us and kill our family, but the police have given us security, and they are taking very good care of us,” Redkar said.Asked about the series of allegations made against  Wankhede by Malik, she said the state minister has made his claims on social media and not in front of a court of law.“Minister Nawab Malik has put allegations against us on Twitter, and Twitter is not a court. If Malik submits allegations against Sameer in a court and if all allegations are proved, then only the person becomes a criminal. Media trials can not help him,” Redkar said.Malik on Monday claimed Wankhede is a Muslim by birth and was hiding his religious identify.Asked about  Malik’s claims, Redkar said they were untrue.“Sameer and I are born Hindus. We have never converted to any other religion. We respect all religions. Sameer’s father, too, is a Hindu who married a Muslim woman...my mom-in-law is no more,” she said.Asked about NCB witness Prabhakar Sail’s claim that there was an extortion bid of Rs 25 crore by some agency officials, including Wankhede, and others for letting off Aryan Khan in the drugs case, Redkar said if he has evidence, he should produce it in a court.Earlier in the day, Malik launched a fresh attack on Wankhede and accused him of illegal phone tapping and said he will hand over a letter listing the IRS officer’s ‘misdeeds’ to the NCB head.“Sameer Wankhede through two persons in Mumbai and Thane is illegally intercepting the mobile phones of some people,” said Malik, who has been targeting Wankhede after his son-in-law’s arrest in a separate drugs case.The state minister also claimed that Wankhede had sought the call detail record (CDR) of a   member of his family from the police.Wankhede, in an affidavit submitted to a Mumbai court on Monday, claimed he was under a “lurking threat of arrest as it does not suit some vested interests for conducting an honest and impartial investigation”.In the past, Malik has made a series of allegations against Wankhede, ranging from forging documents, lying about his religion to dubbing some of the cases investigated under his supervision as fake.The 2008-batch IRS officer has refuted all allegations made by Malik. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anti-wankhede-people-threatening-us-trolling-us-were-living-in-fear-wife-329986

26-10-2021||New Delhi||DCW Chief asks police to add rape sections in Bulandshahr case, writes to UP CM||Delhi Commission For Women chief Swati Maliwal on Tuesday wrote to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister  Adityanath asking to direct police to add sections of rape in the case of a minor girl who was allegedly sexually assaulted by her neighbour in Bulandshahr.Noting that the minor girl is currently admitted at a hospital in Delhi, Maliwal urged Adityanath to provide compensation to the victim's family and ensure that the trial of the case takes place in a fast-track court.The girl is being treated at a hospital in Delhi.Maliwal said the girl was brutally raped by a man in Bulandshahar, who inflicted several injuries on her and tried to strangle her."I visited her in the hospital and she is in a very critical condition," Maliwal wrote in the letter.The incident took place on October 15, when the victim's parents had gone to work in the field and the girl was playing outside her home along with her two sisters. Around 12 noon, their neighbour, a 45-year-old man took the girl inside the house and raped her."Thereafter, he attacked her with a knife and tried to strangulate her and fled from the spot. Her five-year-old sister witnessed the whole incident," the letter stated.The parents of the girl took her to a nearby hospital in Bulandshahr, but she was referred to a facility in Meerut. Due to her critical condition, she was eventually referred to Delhi.Presently, the girl is admitted to a leading hospital in Delhi and has still not gained consciousness, she said."The doctors have informed me that she has several brutal injuries on her body. She has also developed a serious neurological issue due to a brain injury," she said.In her letter, Maliwal claimed that "the most shocking aspect of the case" is that despite the brutality of the crime, while the UP Police registered an FIR in the matter, it failed to add sections of rape."This is deeply distressing.

26-10-2021||New Delhi||Govt notifies framework for traffic management of drones in lower airspace||The Civil Aviation Ministry has notified a traffic management framework for drones under which public and private third-party service providers will manage their movement in the airspace under 1,000 feet.Current air traffic management (ATM) systems have not been designed to handle the traffic from unmanned aircraft, the framework issued on October 24 stated.“Integration of unmanned aircraft in the Indian airspace using conventional means may require unmanned aircraft to be equipped with bulky and expensive hardware, which is neither feasible nor advisable,” it noted.This requires the creation of a separate, modern, primarily software-based, automated UAS (unmanned aircraft system) Traffic Management (UTM) system, it said, adding that such systems may subsequently be integrated into traditional ATM systems.The integration of UTM and ATM will be important to continuously separate manned and unmanned aircraft from each other in the airspace.The framework allows third-party service providers to give services such as registration, flight planning, dynamic deconfliction and access to supplementary data like weather, terrain and position of manned aircraft.Also, a set of supplementary service providers will also be permitted under the framework to provide services such as insurance and data analytics to support the UTM ecosystem.DigitalSky platform shall continue to be the interface for government stakeholders to provide approvals and permissions to drone operators wherever required, according to the framework.All drones (except Nano drones operating in the green zone) shall be required to mandatorily share their real-time location through the network to the Centre either directly or through third-party service providers, it mentioned.It said the third-party service providers will first be deployed in small geographical areas that could be increased gradually.Moreover, these service providers will be permitted to charge drone operators a service fee and a small portion of it might have to be shared with the Airports Authority of India (AAI), which manages the ATM.Smit Shah, director of industry body DroneFederation of India, said in a statement: “Traditional traffic management services provided by ATCs (air traffic controllers) for manned aircraft cannot be scaled for managing drone traffic which is expected to become at least 100 times higher since the traditional ATM is manual and requires human intervention.”This policy framework shall allow third-party service providers to deploy highly automated, algorithm-driven software services for managing drone traffic across the country, he added.The Union government had on September 15 approved a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for drones and drone components with an allocation of Rs 120 crore spread over three financial years.The ministry had on August 25 notified the Drone Rules, 2021 that eased the regulation of drone operations in India by reducing the number of forms that need to be filled to operate them from 25 to five and decreasing the types of fees charged from the operator from 72 to four.The framework has been issued under the Drone Rules, 2021, only.

26-10-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Baby kidnap case rocks Kerala Assembly; UDF terms it ‘honour crime’||The Kerala Assembly on Tuesday witnessed heated arguments and protests as the opposition UDF raised the issue of a ruling CPI (M) leader putting up his grandchild for adoption without the knowledge of his daughter, terming it as one of the most heinous “honour crimes” reported in the state.Hitting hard at the Left government, the Congress-led opposition alleged that the top leaders of the Marxist party and the entire government machinery were complicit in the crime and demanded a judicial probe into the incident.They also questioned the present claim of the CPI(M) leadership that their stand was to get the mother her baby back.It was interesting to note that Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) leader and Vadakara legislator K K Rema, an arch critic of the CPI(M) and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, sought notice for the adjournment motion on behalf of the opposition.In her hard-hitting speech, Rema alleged that the police and the State Council for Child Welfare, who should have acted in accordance with the law, had committed serious lapses in the case under the influence of the complainant Anupama S Chandran’s father, a local committee member of the CPI(M).Vijayan, who holds the home portfolio, could stand only with his head down in front of the mothers and children of the state, she said.“Anupama and her child are the victims of one of the most heinous honour crimes Kerala has ever witnessed....It was as an honour crime executed collectively by the entire state machinery,” she said.Not just to Anupama, but they have shown cruelty also to the couple that adopted the child without knowing all the background, she said.“It was a shock to know that all the government system were in complicit in the crime along with the family. The child welfare committee should be dissolved and a judicial probe should be conducted into the incident,” Rema said.Meanwhile, the opposition members trooped to the well of the House and protested alleging that Speaker MB Rajesh did not give enough time for the woman leader to complete her speech.Leader of Opposition, V D Satheesan said though the actions of the state-run Council was “mysterious” in connection with the incident, the government was trying to whitewash their crimes and protect them instead of punishing the wrongdoers.The Marxist party and its government, who were always waxing eloquent about progressive ideologies, had adopted a reactionary stand in the issue and intervened in it in the way an extreme right wing group would do, he further charged.However, State Minister for Health and Woman and Child Welfare Veena George rejected the demand of the opposition to discuss the matter in the House suspending all other proceedings.Rubbishing the charges, she said the state-run panel had put up the child for adoption after fulfilling all mandatory legal proceedings.The court proceedings should be completed for Anupama to get her baby back, she said adding that the infant should be with its mother if she is ready to look after it.The 24-year-old Anupama had accused her parents of having taken away her newborn child forcibly from her soon a year ago and alleged that though she had complained about it to the police several times since April, they were reluctant to register a case against the family members.However, Peroorkkada police here have said a case was registered earlier this week against six people, including her parents, sister and husband, and father’s two friends, and said the delay happened as they were awaiting legal opinion.A family court here on Monday stayed the adoption process of the child and directed the police to submit a detailed report in a sealed cover.The matter was posted for further hearing on November 1. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/baby-kidnap-case-rocks-kerala-assembly-udf-terms-it-honour-crime-329941

Another woman joins them and gifts both of them a saree to wear for the occasion.In the night, both women are seen facing each other like husband-wife with a decorated plate having a glass of water, signalling them as partners following which Fem's logo appears on the screen and the voiceover says, "glow with pride".WHY these kind of woke experiments are being deliberately done only with Hindu Festivals & traditions?? #Dabur #DaburAd #KarwaChauth pic.twitter.com/PYA0Y2WWez   Though a section of people also hailed Dabur for its pro-LBGQTIA+ stance. On Monday, Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra had said he has directed the state police chief to convey to Dabur India to withdraw the "objectionable" beauty product advertisement and take legal steps if the ad is not taken back by the consumer goods maker.  Earlier on Sunday night, Dabur had responded to the social media backlash in a separate statement, saying, “Dabur and Fem as a brand strive for diversity, inclusion and equality, and we proudly support these values in our organisation and within our communities. “Our campaigns too reflect the same. We understand that not everyone will agree with our stance, and we respect their right to hold a different point of view. Our intention is not to offend any beliefs, customs and traditions, religious or otherwise. If we have hurt the sentiments of any individual or group, it was unintentional, and we apologise,” it had said. Attacks on corporate houses on such progressive commercials are on the rise in recent times.Earlier, Tata Group's jewellery brand Tanishq was forced to withdraw an advertisement that showed an interfaith couple at a baby shower organised for the Hindu bride by her Muslim in-laws.It withdrew the advertisement after trolling soon spread to physical threats to company employees and stores.Clothing brand Manyavar too was at the receiving end when its advertisement featuring Bollywood actor Alia Bhatt in wedding attire, appeared to question an old tradition. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dabur-withdraws-ad-showing-lesbian-couple-celebrating-karwachauth-tenders-unconditionally-apology-329940

26-10-2021||Lucknow||Midnight drama in Lucknow over 'surrender' of Gosavi, who took selfie with Shah Rukh's son Aryan during drugs raid||Lucknow witnessed high drama around midnight on Monday when Kiran Gosavi, the private detective from Mumbai who made headlines with his selfie with Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan after his arrest by the Narcotics Control Bureau  (NCB), announced that he would surrender at Mandiaon police station 'any moment.' Kiran Gosavi, the Narcotics Control Bureau's 'independent witness' in the cruise ship drugs case, against whom a lookout notice is out, said he wanted to surrender before the Uttar Pradesh police as he felt 'threatened' in Maharashtra.But the expected drama ended in anti-climax when Gosavi failed to turn up and Lucknow police commissioner DK Thakur said that Gosavi cannot surrender in the Lucknow 'because the Lucknow police station does not have the jurisdiction to take any action against him'.An unverified audio clip circulated by sources close to Gosavi, indicated the policemen at a local station in Lucknow unceremoniously turned him down.The clip was of a phone call where a man, purportedly Gosavi, is heard asking if it was the Madiaon police chowki. After confirming, he says "I want to come there. I am Kiran Gosavi. I want to surrender here."Why do you want to come here?" the policeman asks."This is the nearest police station for me at the moment," Gosavi says.Once the policeman confirms that he indeed wanted to surrender, he says, "No, you can't surrender here. Try somewhere else." As the audio clip went viral, huge crowds, mainly media, started collecting at the Mandiaon police station and security was beefed up.A number of officers were seen waiting outside the building.Senior officials did not rule out the possibility of Gosavi deliberately talking about surrendering in Lucknow to deflect the focus of the police in Maharashtra.It was only around midnight that the crowds dispersed when the police confirmed that there would be no surrender.In a telephonic conversation with some news channels, earlier on Monday evening, Gosavi had said that he wished to surrender in Lucknow as he felt 'threatened' in Mumbai.A private investigator, Gosavi was present during the cruise ship raid and later at the NCB office with Aryan Khan. His selfie and videos with Aryan Khan at both places indicated that he had unlimited access to the son of Shah Rukh Khan.This  fueled questions from Maharashtra's ruling alliance about the anti-drugs agency's investigation. Several leaders questioned why an 'independent witness' of the agency should be present at the raid and its office and take selfies with the high-profile  accused.A day ago, a man claiming to be Gosavi's personal bodyguard made allegations of bribery against him.Prabhakar Sail, who is another witness in the case, said he heard Gosavi having a telephonic conversation about pay-offs with one Sam D'Souza.Sail claimed he heard Gosavi say they should ask for a 'bomb Rs 25 crore' and then settle at Rs 18 crore, of which Rs 8 crore is for the NCB's zonal officer in charge of the investigation, Sameer Wankhede.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/midnight-drama-in-lucknow-over-surrender-of-gosavi-who-took-selfie-with-shah-rukhs-son-aryan-during-drugs-raid-329864

The petitioner submitted that for the public, the number of weapons in possession of licensee may or may not be reducible from three to two, but the reduction did not apply to the category of licensees who were members of a rifle association. — TNSNo NEET counselling for now, says Centre The Centre on Monday told the SC that the counselling process for the NEET-PG will not commence till the court decided the challenge to 27% reservation for OBC and 10% for EWS candidates in the PG All-India quota seats.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mha-gets-notice-on-plea-against-directions-to-deposit-weapon-329608

Quoting Brown, the health journal added, “Rich nations have promised to donate vaccines to poorer ones, but have failed to deliver.”Data show only two in five healthcare workers are fully vaccinated on average, but this is less than one in 10 in the African and Western Pacific regions.The Indian Medical Association has reported that 800 doctors have died of the virus at home.

In a “statement of objection” filed before the top court, it sought dismissal of Delhi BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay’s petition “in the interest of justice”, terming the grounds raised by him as “self-serving” and “untenable in law”.“The Bengaluru City Police have not housed Rohingya in any camp or detention centre within its jurisdiction. However, 72 Rohingya identified in Bengaluru city are working in various fields and Bengaluru City Police have not taken any coercive action against them,” the Karnataka Government said, while submitting a list of Rohingya living in Bengaluru.The Supreme Court had in March this year issued notice on Upadhyay’s PIL seeking directions to the Centre and states to detect, detain and deport all illegal immigrants within a year. He also wanted the top court to direct the Central and states to declare creating forged or fabricated PAN, Aadhaar numbers, Passports, Ration and voter cards and other such documents a non bailable and non-compoundable offence.Alleging large-scale entry of illegal immigrants, particularly from Myanmar and Bangladesh, Upadhyay had in his PIL filed in 2017 contended that it not only threatened the demographic structure of bordering districts but also seriously impaired national security.“Demographic composition in the country, particularly the bordering districts has altered with illegal immigration from Myanmar and Bangladesh. The bordering districts of Assam, West Bengal Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura have recorded growth of population higher than the national average. Illegal immigrants have been using West Bengal as a corridor to migrate to other parts,” he submitted.72 identified in Bengaluru||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-opposes-bjp-leaders-pil-seeking-rohingya-deportation-329587

The big achievement of the farmers’ movement was that it got the support of all sections of society not only in the country but also globally, he added. “Had we entered New Delhi on November 26 last year, the movement would have been limited to Delhi. Now, it is spread all across the country, which is a big success for the movement,” he claimed. Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, BKU (Lakhowal) said the morcha had completed 11 months of peaceful protest at the Delhi border even though the government “attempted to defame the morcha several times”. Darshan Pal Singh, SKM convener and president of the Krantikari Kisan Union, said 500 organisations were working with the morcha. Besides those related to the organisations, other people too had reached out to express solidarity with the SKM.All these months, the unity and coordination between the farmers’ organisations have only strengthened, claimed the morcha. The movement has focused on the demands and problems of the farming community. Besides, it has also united the people against privatisation and the “pro-corporate culture”, he added.Farmers await and go by the call of the SKM, which lends might to the movement, added Darshan Pal Singh. Stir a big success… all across countryHad we entered New Delhi on November 26 last year, the movement would have been limited to the Capital.

He is also the chief vigilance officer of the anti-narcotics agency.“We have received the affidavit and a report from our DDG (northwest) based in Mumbai and the NCB Director General (DG) has taken cognisance of this report. He has marked it to the vigilance section for inquiry,” Gyaneshwar Singh said.Asked if Wankhede would continue to probe the case, he said the question was “premature and we will take a call as the inquiry progresses”.Officials said the inquiry would look at all aspects of the claims made by independent witness Prabhakar Sail and would also record Wankhede and other officers’ statement.Meanwhile, a special Mumbai court said it “cannot pass a blanket order barring courts from taking cognisance” of an affidavit of an independent witness, in which he has levelled allegations of extortion attempt by Wankhede and others. The NCB and Wankhede had earlier in the day filed two separate affidavits before the court against the allegations. The agency and officer sought the court to pass an order saying no court should take cognisance of the affidavit prepared by Prabhakar Sail.According to them, the allegations were only an attempt to create hurdles and scuttle the investigation into the case. Speaking on the matter, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said deliberate attempts were being made to malign Maharashtra through the case, and claimed “some officials will get exposed”.Raut claimed a person named Sam D’Souza, seen in some pictures related to the arrest of Aryan, was the “biggest money laundering player in Mumbai”.

26-10-2021||New Delhi||Congress seeks JPC probe into Facebook’s alleged role in ‘influencing’ India’s elections||The Congress on Monday accused Facebook of “influencing” India’s elections and “undermining” democracy and demanded a joint parliamentary committee probe into it.“Facebook has reduced itself to a Fakebook,” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said while raising the purported leaked internal reports of the social media giant on not initiating action against hate speech posts on its platform in India.The Congress leader also alleged that Facebook was acting as an ally of the ruling BJP and pushing its agenda.He referred to research documents by whistleblower Frances Haugen, who has worked at Facebook, and alleged that it took no decisive action against the perpetrators of such hate posts in Hindi and Bengali.A Facebook company spokesperson here said it is improving enforcement.“We’ve invested significantly in technology to find hate speech in various languages, including Hindi and Bengali. As a result, we’ve reduced the amount of hate speech that people see by half this year. “Today, it’s down to 0.05 percent. Hate speech against marginalised groups, including Muslims, is on the rise globally. So we are improving enforcement and are committed to updating our policies as hate speech evolves online,” the spokesperson said.Khera alleged that Facebook’s internal reports identified fake accounts with over a million impressions, yet it did nothing about it.“We demand a JPC probe to look into the role of Facebook in influencing our elections,” he told reporters.He alleged that Facebook was trying to “compromise and undermine our democracy in trying to shape through fake posts the opinions of people”.He alleged that BJP workers and those of its affiliates have infiltrated into the structure and functioning of Facebook.“What right does Facebook have to push a particular ideology through fake posts, pictures and a narrative.“It is shocking how only 0.2 percent of hate speech is removed by Facebook, which despite making the most money from India, does not have the mechanism to filter posts in Hindi or Bengali,” he said.Khera said just 9 per cent of users in India are in English and yet they do not have systems to filter the posts of regional languages.Alleging that the role of Facebook during Delhi riots and West Bengal elections has been under suspicion, he said “The role of Facebook can no longer be dismissed as an error of omission as they are knowingly furthering the agenda of the ruling party and its ideology which is hate-filled, bigotry and dividing society.”                “Why should we not accuse Facebook of interfering in our elections by influencing the voting behaviour of its consumers. This is serious election fraud and this is serious interference in our elections by a foreign company,” he alleged.“Why is Facebook quiet on these accusations which have come from within it. Why is the government silent on this, just because it suits their agenda and Facebook has become a tool in the hands of the BJP and its affiliates,” he asked.Khera alleged that in the wake of an expose by its own former employee, there are many questions that Facebook, as well as the government, need to answer.“Despite knowing all of this, why hasn’t Facebook designated RSS and Bajrang Dal as ‘dangerous organisations’ based on its own internal reports?“While the Government of India had been extremely proactive against Twitter citing Social Media safety compliance, why are they not uttering a word now,” he asked.He also alleged that internal reports and recommendations of Facebook’s security team went against the recommendations of Facebook’s safety team, insofar as they prioritised commercial interests over the safety of Indian citizens, and yet no action has been taken by the Government.“Doesn’t this clearly implicate the presence of a ‘quid pro quo’,” he asked.Internal documents at Facebook show “a struggle with misinformation, hate speech and celebrations of violence” in India, the company’s biggest market, with researchers at the social media giant pointing out that there are groups and pages “replete with inflammatory and misleading anti-Muslim content” on its platform, US media reports have said.

He has marked it to the vigilance section for inquiry.“We are a professional organisation and we are open for inquiry against any allegation against our staffers. The inquiry will be transparent and fair,” Gyaneshwar Singh told PTI.Asked if Wankhede will continue to probe the cruise case till this inquiry goes on, Singh said the question was “premature and we will take a call as the inquiry progresses and evidence are gathered”. Officials said the NCB inquiry will look at all aspects of the claims made by Sail and will also record the version of Wankhede and other officers of the Mumbai zonal unit involved in this drugs bust case.The inquiry team may also question Sail, they said.Wankhede, an Indian Revenue Service (IRS) of 2008 batch Customs cadre, is expected to join the inquiry at the NCB headquarters here in the next few days.He has denied the charges made in the affidavit by Sail.The officer on Sunday also wrote to Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale, seeking protection from likely legal action “being planned” against him by unknown persons to falsely frame him concerning an alleged vigilance-related issue.Officers have impeccable service record, NCB tells court     Meanwhile, the NCB in an affidavit submitted before a special court inn Mumbai on Monday said Wankhede and other officers have an impeccable service record.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncb-orders-vigilance-inquiry-into-cruise-drugs-extortion-allegations-329427
26-10-2021||Bhopal||Bajrang Dal activists ransack set of 'Ashram-3' in Madhya Pradesh; throw ink at Prakash Jha||Bajrang Dal activists allegedly ransacked the set of the third season of web series 'Ashram' here and also threw ink at its producer-director Prakash Jha, accusing him of portraying Hindus wrongly, police said.The windscreens of two buses of the crew were also broken in stone-pelting, they said.Bajrang Dal also threatened to stop the series' shoot.Talking to PTI, Superintendent of Police (SP), Bhopal south, Sai Krishna Thota, said that some people raised objections and staged protests over the name of the web series when its shooting was underway at Old Jail Premises located in Arera Hills."Bajrang Dal activists objected that this web series hurt the sentiments of Hindus as it contains obscene scenes," he said.The protesters also threw ink on Prakash Jha and pelted stones, the officer added.Thota said that the windscreens of two buses were damaged due to stone-pelting and one person was injured.He said that immediately after the incident, police personnel reached the spot and brought the situation under control.No person has been arrested in this regard so far, he said.Bajrang Dal activists also raised slogans against Prakash Jha and Bollywood actor Bobby Deol, who is in the lead role in the web series Ashram, accusing them of hurting the Hindu sentiments, eyewitnesses said.Talking to reporters, Bajrang Dal's state convener Sushil Surhele said the activists of his organisation will not allow the shooting of 'Ashram' in Bhopal."Prakash Jha wrongly portrayed the arrangements in a Hindu ashram in its previous seasons by showing the exploitation of women by gurus. There have been ashrams in Sanatan Dharma for the past thousand years that played important role in building social values. There is no truth in what has been shown in this web series," he said.Will Jha dare to make such a web series on other religions, he asked."We blackened the face of Prakash Jha and are searching for Bobby Deol, who should learn from his elder brother Sunny Deol (Bollywood actor and BJP MP), who has played roles in patriotic movies," he added.So far, no statement was issued on behalf of Prakash Jha.Talking to reporters, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Irshad Wali said strict action will be taken against those involved in the incident."Three-four vehicles were damaged and we will identify the people involved in this ruckus. Action will be taken against such persons," he said.‘Disgusting’: Industry condemns attackThe Producers Guild of India and Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) on Monday criticised the attack.In a statement posted on Twitter, the Producers Guild of India said it strongly condemns the “brazen acts of violence, harassment and vandalism” faced by the crew.“Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident and the Guild is alarmed to note the frequency with which both the production and exhibition sectors are severely and illegally disrupted by various elements with impunity.“Content production contributes significantly to local economies, generates employment and promotes tourism, which is why authorities in India and across the world formulate policies to attract producers to their respective regions,” the statement read.The Guild said the least that production units should expect—more than incentives and benefits—is for the authorities to provide the guarantee of safety and security for their units.“We urge the relevant authorities to take immediate and strict action against the perpetrators of these acts of violence and to bring them to justice,” the statement read.In another press statement, the FWICE appealed to the government to take cognizance of the incident and initiate “stringent action” against those involved in the vandalism.“The safety and security of our members is at high risk and increasing day by day due to such incidents and ignorance of the same by the respective authorities. We look for justice. The FWICE is and will always stand strongly with the Producer/Director and their crew members and extends all its required support to eradicate such happenings from the otherwise peaceful Industry,” the statement read.Superintendent of Police (SP), Bhopal south, Sai Krishna Thota told PTI that some people raised objections and staged protests over the name of the web series when it’s shooting was underway.“Bajrang Dal activists objected that this web series hurt the sentiments of Hindus as it contains obscene scenes,” he said.The officer said that the windscreens of two buses were damaged due to stone pelting and one person was injured. No person has been arrested in this regard so far.According to eyewitnesses, Bajrang Dal activists also raised slogans against Jha and Deol, accusing them of hurting the Hindu sentiments.The first and the second season of the series premiered last year on MX Player.The vandalism has been criticised by filmmakers Hansal Mehta, Sanjay Gupta and others.“Scared silence and continued deference will only empower such hooligans and further such oppression. But who will bell the cat?” Mehta captioned a news feed.Producer Pritish Nandy tweeted, “There appears to be no end to these kind of attacks. It is time the ministry spoke out and reined these guys in. They are running amuck.”       Filmmaker Sudhir Mishra also shared a news clip of the incident and wrote, “What? This is terrible. The industry has to get together otherwise … (do I have to state it). Come on, ‘Associations’. Stand with your members!”         Gupta reacted to the news by tweeting, “DISGUSTING!!!”— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bajrang-dal-activists-ransack-set-of-ashram-3-in-madhya-pradesh-throw-ink-at-prakash-jha-329416
