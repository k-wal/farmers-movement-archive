The High Court also noted that the District Judge's approach to the identification of a prima facie case in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud case was “correct”."Given the test he had to apply, and the volume of evidence relied upon against the appellant [Modi], he was entitled to conclude that each of the requests disclosed a prima facie case,” the High Court ruling notes.Modi is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of letters of undertaking (LoUs) or loan agreements, and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.He also faces two additional charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death”, which were added to the CBI case.If Modi wins the December appeal hearing in the High Court, he cannot be extradited unless the Indian government is successful in getting permission to appeal at the Supreme Court on a point of law of public importance.On the flip side, if he loses that appeal hearing, Modi can approach the Supreme Court on a point of law of public importance, to be applied for to the apex court against the High Court's decision within 14 days of a High Court verdict. However, this involves a high threshold as appeals to the Supreme Court can only be made if the High Court has certified that the case involves a point of law of general public importance.Finally, after all avenues in the UK courts are exhausted, the diamantaire could still seek a so-called Rule 39 injunction from the European Court of Human Rights.

20-10-2021||Dehradun/New Delhi||Uttarakhand struggles with rain aftermath: 46 people dead, 11 still missing||Eleven people remained missing, boulders blocked roads and many villages went without electricity as authorities took stock Wednesday of the aftermath of the rains that battered Uttarakhand for over two days.Forty-six people have died due to the rains since Sunday night and some are still feared buried under the debris of collapsed houses.The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) said it has rescued over 1,300 people from flood-affected areas of Uttarakhand. The federal force has deployed 17 rescue teams in the state.“So far, NDRF rescuers have evacuated more than 1,300 stranded people from Udham Singh Nagar and Nanital. They are also distributing relief material in flood-affected areas of Uttarakhand,” a spokesperson said.Six NDRF teams are deployed in Udham Singh Nagar, two teams each are stationed in Uttarkashi, Chamoli and one each in Dehradun, Champawat Pithoragarh and Haridwar.“Two teams and a sub-team have been deployed in Nainital while one sub-team is placed at Almora,” the spokesperson said.The weather cleared up Wednesday morning but authorities faced the challenge of rescuing people trapped under debris and restoring road and power links to places cut off by the rains.Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami toured rain-hit areas in Kumaon region, instructing officials to prepare an estimate of the damage.Union Home Minister Amit Shah was also expected to conduct an aerial survey and visit the state capital Dehradun later in the day.Tourist town Nainital was returning back to normalcy.A furious Gaula river has damaged the tracks at Kathgodam railway station in Nainital, which experienced a record 445 mm rainfall on Tuesday.  The district accounts for 29 of the 46 deaths so far.The damaged tracks in Kathgodam may take four or five days to be repaired, DGP Ashok Kumar told PTI.In Nainital, tourists woke up to a bright morning without a trace of rain on Wednesday and were out on the streets for shopping and sightseeing. Taxis had begun running through the town.“It was suffocating to be locked up inside our hotel rooms due to the incessant rains on Tuesday,” a young tourist from Uttar Pradesh said.He added that the scenic beauty of the place had made up for what they had suffered over the last two days.By Wednesday morning, most of the water had receded from the roads in Nainital, where movement had become nearly impossible after Naini lake overflowed.Electricity supply and telephone connectivity, badly hit by the rains, have been restored in the town.

Searches were then conducted by the NIA in Chennai, Coimbatore and Vijayawada at premises of the accused.

20-10-2021||Agra/Lucknow||Priyanka Gandhi allowed to proceed to Agra by UP police||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who was stopped by the Uttar Pradesh police on Wednesday from going to Agra to meet the family members of a man who died in police custody, was allowed to proceed in the evening.The police have allowed Priyanka Gandhi to go and she has left for Agra, Congress spokesperson Anshu Awasthi said.The Lucknow police have allowed four people, including UPCC president Ajay Kumar Lallu and senior leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam, to accompany Priyanka Gandhi, Awasthi said.Police said the Congress general secretary was stopped at the Lucknow-Agra expressway as the Agra district magistrate had requested not to allow any political personality to go there following the man’s death.“She was neither taken into custody nor arrested. Because of the massive crowds, the traffic movement was being hampered and she was first asked to either go to the party office or her residence but when she did not agree, she was sent to the police lines,” Lucknow Police Commissioner D K Thakur said.A Congress spokesperson had claimed that Priyanka Gandhi was taken into custody while she was going to Agra.To a query from reporters in Kushinagar on the Congress leader being stopped from going to Agra, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said, “Law and order is supreme and no one will be allowed to play with it.”While being taken to the police lines, Priyanka Gandhi told reporters that she will definitely go to Agra.A similar confrontation had occurred earlier this month when the Uttar Pradesh police had prevented the Congress leader from visiting the families of the farmers killed in Lakhimpur Kheri.She was taken into preventive custody for over 48 hours before being allowed to visit the families along with Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders.“Do I need someone’s permission whenever I move out of Lucknow? Is there a problem? Why am I not being allowed to go to Agra? Is there a law-and-order issue?” Priyanka Gandhi asked the policemen who stopped her cavalcade.“Someone has died, how can it be a law-and-order issue? Ask the DM by calling him. It is too much that I cannot go out anywhere and should remain confined to a guesthouse in Lucknow,” she told the policemen when they showed her the Agra district magistrate’s message.Congress workers who had reached the spot in large numbers raised slogans against the Uttar Pradesh government after Priyanka Gandhi was not allowed to proceed to Agra.In a tweet in Hindi, the Congress general secretary asked if beating anyone to death in police custody was any kind of justice.“The incident of Arun Valmiki’s death in police custody in Agra is condemnable. On the day of Valmiki Jayanti, the Uttar Pradesh government has acted against his messages. A high-level investigation should be held and action taken against the policemen, and the victim’s family should be compensated,” she said.In another tweet after being stopped from going to Agra, the Congress leader said, “Arun Valmiki died in police custody. His family is seeking justice. I want to visit the family. What is the Uttar Pradesh government afraid of? Why am I being stopped? Today is Valmiki Jayanti, the prime minister spoke a lot about Buddha but is attacking his messages.”Close on the heels of a Kanpur-based businessman’s death allegedly after being thrashed by police in a Gorakhpur hotel, a man accused of stealing Rs 25 lakh from a police station in Agra died in police custody after his health deteriorated during interrogation.Senior Superintendent of Police (Agra) Muniraj G said the accused, Arun, suddenly fell sick on Tuesday night while a raid was being carried out at his house to recover the stolen money.He was taken to a hospital where doctors declared him dead, the officer said.Manish Gupta (36), a businessman from Kanpur, died due to alleged police thrashing in a Gorakhpur hotel last month. The Uttar Pradesh police have already recommended a CBI probe into the incident.Arun was accused of stealing the money on Saturday night from the “malkhana” (a storage house where items confiscated by police are kept)” of the Jagdishpura police station, where he worked as a cleaner.Following the theft, six police personnel, including the station house officer, were suspended by the additional director general (ADG) of police of the Agra zone.During the investigation, police rounded up several suspects. Arun was one of them as he had access to the “malkhana”.He was arrested from the Taj Ganj locality in Agra on Tuesday. According to the police, Arun had shaved his head to hide his identity.“Police teams were questioning several suspects in connection with the theft. On Tuesday evening, a man named Arun, who is a resident of the Lohamandi area, was taken into police custody,” the SSP said.“During interrogation, Arun admitted that he had committed the theft and informed us that the stolen money was kept at his home,” he added.Police recovered Rs 15 lakh during the raid at his house before his health deteriorated and he died.The SSP said the body was sent for a post-mortem examination and suitable action will be taken after the report comes. A complaint has also been filed by Arun’s family in connection with his death, he added.People from the Valmiki community gathered at Arun’s house and demanded a fair probe into his death.Local leaders of the community said they would not observe “Maharishi Valmiki Jayanti” on Wednesday until a fair investigation is launched in the matter.

20-10-2021||New Delhi||Actor Jacqueline Fernandez appears before ED||Actor Jacqueline Fernandez appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday for questioning in connection with an over Rs 200 crore money laundering case being probed against alleged conman Sukesh Chandrashekar, officials said.The actor deposed before the federal agency around 3:30 pm after skipping its summons at least thrice earlier.Fernandez, 36, has once appeared before the federal agency in August and recorded her statement under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in this case.It is understood that the agency wants to confront her with the main accused in the case Chandrashekhar and his actor wife Leena Maria Paul and also record her statement again.The agency, they said, wants to understand some trail of funds and transactions that are allegedly linked to Fernandez in this case.Actor and dancer Nora Fatehi, 29, recorded her statement with the ED last week in this case.Fatehi’s representative had said that she has been the victim in the case and being a witness, she is cooperating and helping the officers in the investigation.Chandrashekhar and Paul were recently arrested by the ED while they were already lodged in a local jail after they were taken into custody by the Delhi Police on charges of cheating some people, including some high-profile individuals like former Fortis Healthcare promoter Shivinder Mohan Singh’s wife Aditi Singh.In August, the ED had raided some of Chandrashekhar’s premises and seized a sea-facing bungalow in Chennai, Rs 82.5 lakh cash and over a dozen luxury cars.It had claimed in a statement that Chandrashekhar is a “known conman” and is being probed by the Delhi Police in a case of alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating and extortion to the tune of about Rs 200 crore.“Chandrasekhar is the mastermind of this fraud. He has been part of the crime world since the age of 17. He has multiple FIRs against him and is presently lodged in Rohini jail (in connection with the Delhi Police case),” the ED had said.Despite being in the jail, it said, Chandrashekhar “did not stop conning” people, the ED said.“He (with a cellphone procured illegally in prison) with the help of technology, made spoof calls to dupe people as the numbers displayed on the called party’s phone number belonged to senior government officers.“While speaking (from prison) to these people, he claimed to be a government officer offering to help people for a price,” the ED had claimed. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/actor-jacqueline-fernandez-appears-before-ed-327099
20-10-2021||Mumbai||IPS officer Param Bir Singh not traceable, Maharashtra tells HC||The whereabouts of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh were not known, the Maharashtra government on Wednesday told the Bombay High Court.As the IPS officer was not traceable, it did not wish to continue its assurance that no coercive action (such as arrest) would be taken against him in an Atrocities Act case, the government said.Senior counsel Darius Khambata, appearing for the state, told a division bench of Justices Nitin Jamdar and Sarang Kotwal that the circumstances had changed.“He isn’t traceable. In these circumstances, we do not want to continue our earlier statement where the government said it would not take any coercive action against him,” Khambata said.Param Bir Singh’s counsel Mahesh Jethmalani said he had not been declared as an absconder yet.“In this case, he was summoned twice and both the times he responded,” Jethmalani said.The high court was hearing a petition filed by the senior IPS officer seeking to quash the FIR lodged against him under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and relevant IPC sections on a complaint filed by police inspector Bhimrao Ghadge.The judges adjourned the hearing to the next week.Ghadge, presently posted in Akola district, has leveled allegations of corruption against Singh and some other officers when Singh was Thane police commissioner.Singh pressurised him to drop the names of some persons from a case and when he refused, he was framed up in false cases, Ghadge claimed.The FIR was registered under the Atrocities Act as the complainant belongs to an SC community as well as for extortion and some other Indian Penal Code offenses.Singh’s lawyer claimed that the FIR was a backlash over Singh’s allegations of corruption against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh.The IPS officer is also facing at least four extortion cases in Thane and Mumbai.He was transferred from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March after the arrest of police officer (now dismissed) Sachin Waze in the case of an SUV with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran.Singh then accused Deshmukh of asking Waze to collect Rs 100 crore every month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai. The NCP leader, who denied the allegation, soon stepped down as minister and is facing CBI probe.

20-10-2021||New Delhi||Rajbhar ties up with Samajwadi Party instead of BJP||The alignment of political forces against the ruling BJP appears to be falling in place with a former minister in the Yogi Adityanath government on Wednesday committing to the Samajwadi Party.In a major political development today, Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav and Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar declared that they are together in the fight for Dalits, backwards and other weaker sections of the society.“The Samajwadi Party and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party will fight together the battle of the deprived, oppressed, backwards, Dalits, women, farmers, youths and other weaker sections of the society,” the SP tweeted from its official handle adding “Sapa-Subhspa (SP-SBPS) saath-saath, UP main bhajpa (BJP) saaf”.  “The SP and the SBSP are together, the BJP is clearly out,” it said along with a photograph of the meeting between Yadav and Rajbhar.Interestingly though, there was no mention of whether the two will also contest the upcoming elections in a coalition or of a pre-poll understanding.Observers, however, said the intention and wordings of the tweet was clear.“Sapa-Subhspa (SP-SBPS) saath-saath, UP main bhajpa (BJP) saaf. Coming barely months before the elections, it is a significant statement,” they saidRajbhar, who contested the last Assembly elections with the BJP, last week hinted he might again form an alliance with the saffron party for the upcoming elections. His meeting with state BJP president Swatantra Dev Singh had also triggered speculation that he might go with the BJP again.Rajbhar also called today’s meeting with Akhilesh Yadav a “courtesy call”.“This time BJP is out. SP and SBSP have come together. The BJP government, which ditched Dalits, backwards, minorities and other sections, has just a few days left,” Rajbhar tweeted.Having four MLAs in the present house, his party holds influence in over a dozen districts in the Poorvanchal region.In 2017, the BJP contested in alliance with the SBSP. Rajbhar was also made a minister in the Adityanath government but he resigned before the 2019 polls.Rajbhar is also a part of “Bhagidari Morcha”, a “participatory political front”, with Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM and some other outfits. Also, though the SP and the SBSP announced “they are together”, none of their leaders clearly said if they will contest together. Samajwadi Party leaders said “Akhilesh Yadav will decide seat-sharing, if any. Things will become clear soon”.Rajbhar-led Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha has also announced a rally in Mau later this month.So far, the BJP is contesting with Sanjay Nishad-led Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (Nishad party), which represents communities like fishermen and boatmen whose traditional occupations are centred on rivers, and the Apna Dal, whose leader Anupriya Patel is also a minister of state in the Narendra Modi council in the Centre.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajbhar-ties-up-with-samajwadi-party-instead-of-bjp-327086

20-10-2021||Kushinagar (UP)||Lord Buddha inspiration for India's Constitution even today: Modi||Lord Buddha is the inspiration for India's Constitution even today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday.Addressing a gathering at the Abhidhamma Day programme here, he also asserted that the 'dhamma chakra' on the Tricolour is the driving force for the country.The day symbolises the end of the three-month rainy retreat – 'varshavaas' or 'vassa' – during which Buddhist monks stay in a monastery to pray and meditate."Even today, when someone enters Parliament (of India), they see the mantra 'Dharma Chakra Pravartaanye'," the prime minister, who inaugurated a new international airport here, said while contemporising the message of the Buddha."Buddha is global because he talks about starting from within. Lord Buddha's Buddhatatva is the sense of ultimate responsibility," he added."Today, when the world talks about climate conservation and expresses concern over climate change many questions come up. But if we adopt the message of Buddha, then the path of what has to be done, instead of who has to do it, will be visible," he said.Kushinagar, about 320 km from the state capital Lucknow, is the final resting place of the Buddha. This is where he attained Mahaparinirvana after his death.The inauguration of the Kushinagar International Airport was marked by the landing of a flight from the Sri Lankan capital Colombo bringing a Sri Lankan delegation of over 100 Buddhist monks and dignitaries.

She should take up the fight for the rights of women in Rajasthan," he said.Thousands of people are sitting on a dharna with the dead body in Jamwaramgarh, the MP added."Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is busy glorifying the Gandhi family to save his chair. Women safety must be given priority but Gehlot and the Gandhi family are doing only politics," he said.

It has been developed by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) in association with the Uttar Pradesh government.

20-10-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court sets aside Gujarat High Court order granting furlough to Asaram Bapu's son Narayan Sai||The Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside the order of the Gujarat High Court granting 14-day furlough to rape convict Narayan Sai, son of self-styled godman Asaram Bapu.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna allowed the appeal of the Gujarat government challenging the June 24 order of the high court granting furlough to Sai.The top court said furlough is not an absolute right and it depends on various factors.It said the jail superintendent had given a negative opinion for grant of furlough to Sai as a mobile phone was found from his cell.On August 12, the top court had stayed the Gujarat High Court order giving two-week furlough to Sai.The top court had issued a notice to Sai on the Gujarat government's plea challenging the high court's single-judge order of June 24 and stayed it till further orders.It had said that the proviso to Rule 3(2) of the Bombay Furlough and Parole Rules, 1959, provides that a prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment may be released on furlough “every year” after he completes seven years actual imprisonment.The single-judge bench of the high court ordered the release of Sai on furlough for two weeks on June 24, 2021, but the division bench had stayed it till August 13 and thereafter the state has moved the top court challenging the June 24 order.The state government has contended that under the rules and even in a judgement of this court, it has been held that furlough is not an absolute right and it depends on various factors.It had said Sai and his father were arrested for offences under rape charges and they wield considerable influence with money and muscle power.On April 26, 2019, Sai was convicted under the Indian Penal Code sections 376 (rape), 377 (unnatural offences), 323 (assault), 506-2 (criminal intimidation), and 120-B (conspiracy) by a Surat court and sentenced to life imprisonment.

20-10-2021||New Delhi||UNESCO prize for world-acclaimed Kung Fu Nuns||The world-renowned Kung Fu Nuns of the Drukpa order of Buddhism has won the prestigious Martial Arts Education Prize 2021 from the UNESCO International Centre for Martial Arts for their brave acts of service.The prize recognises the Kung Fu Nuns’ heroic acts of service and championing of gender equality across the Himalayas.Through martial arts, the Drukpa nuns empower young girls to defend themselves, build confidence, and take on leadership roles in their communities.This award from UNESCO ICM also recognises the Kung Fu Nuns’ work in Indian and Nepali communities hit especially hard by the pandemic, leaving many marginalised groups in need of supplies and education.The Kung Fu Nuns hail from the Drukpa Lineage of Indian Buddhism and began learning Kung Fu to build strength and confidence.They now use those skills to serve others through unimaginable acts of bravery—from their recent 2,500 km “Bicycle Yatra for Peace” from Kathmandu, Nepal, to Ladakh, India, to speak out against human trafficking, to their refusal to evacuate after the 2015 Nepal earthquake in order to deliver critical aid to neglected regions.Adept in both weaponry and hand-to-hand combat, they have begun a self-defence training initiative for young girls in the Himalayas, where violence against women is rarely reported.With over 700 Drukpa nuns in the ranks, there is a long waiting list of women and girls who want to join them.The Kung Fu Nuns have transformed the way the Himalayans view not only nuns, but women. Their Kung Fu demonstrations draw audiences in the tens of thousands, inspiring a new generational mindset that women can do anything.Through their acts of service, and by setting an example of empowerment for the marginalised, the young Kung Fu Nuns have become heroes in their own right.Their efforts were honoured with several prestigious international awards. The nuns are recipient of the Atlantic Council’s prestigious Unsung Heroes Award 2020 and the Asia Society’s Game Changer Award 2019. They were also finalists  for the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize for their humanitarianism in the Himalayas.

20-10-2021||New Delhi||What caused devastating rains in Uttarakhand, Kerala at this time of year?||As scary visuals of devastating floods causing damage to infrastructure in Uttarakhand steadily poured out of the state on social media, a most common question asked was, 'Is this happening because of climate change?'Over two dozen people lost their lives, several bridges were washed away, rail track near Kathgodam was upturned and twisted, houses at many places were swallowed by swollen rivers and landslides leading to roadblocks made life difficult for people of Uttarakhand, especially the Kumaon region on Monday and Tuesday when torrential rain pounded the Himalayas breaking several records for the season. Prior to this, over the weekend, large parts of Kerala and some districts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu had witnessed extremely heavy rainfall. There too, over two dozen people lost their lives due to flooding and landslides, and several residential areas suffered massive damages with houses along the riverbank washed away like a pack of cards.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC's) Sixth Assessment Report of the Working Group I (AR6WGI) titled "Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science" released on August 9 this year has warned of increased variability in precipitation and with it, increased spells of heavy rainfall. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued warnings for both the states -- as it had for the eastern coast and Gangetic West Bengal, Bihar, and eastern Uttar Pradesh -- from relevant days ahead of what are termed as 'extreme weather events'. As per IMD predictions, the extremely heavy rainfall in Uttarakhand on Monday and Tuesday was a result of interaction between a Western Disturbance and a low-pressure area over Madhya Pradesh. As per the IMD glossary, Western Disturbance (WD) is a storm that originates over the Mediterranean Sea, Caspian Sea and Black Sea and moves eastwards towards north India.Frequency of Western Disturbances is maximum in the months of December and January, but throughout the year, there are WDs. "In monsoon season too, there is WD. In 2013, on June 16, it was an active WD like the current one. The low-pressure area was laying over Uttar Pradesh. Both interacted and it caused extremely heavy rainfall leading to the Kedarnath tragedy," recalled IMD Director General, Mrutyunjay Mahapatra.  However, Mahapatra refused to directly attribute the frequency of WD or the extreme weather event to climate change as he said, interaction between WDs and low-pressure areas led to this extreme weather episode, and this has happened earlier too."The frequency of heavy rainfall events is increasing due to climate change, especially in association with low pressure areas."   In the case of Kerala too, there have been debates about the impact of climate change. However, the nuanced analysis gives away two separate issues. One of extremely heavy rainfall and the other is the damage due to it. While the experts are divided over whether climate change is responsible for the rainfall quantum, that too in October, there is no debate whatsoever about the widespread destruction to property and infrastructure. Every year since August 2018, when Kerala received once in a century rainfall, a debate on 'whether or not floods in Kerala are man-made?' has become common. The Gadgil Committee Report -- about leaving the Western Ghats untouched in certain areas, bringing in conservation efforts in some others and opening only a few for developmental activities -- has been put on the back burner by all six states, including Kerala.     The tropical forests, the mountain regions and the rain brought because of it makes the Western Ghats one of the 10 "biodiversity hotspots", meaning, harbouring a diversity of flora and fauna. The once-dense forest all over is now reduced substantially, but whatever remains not just soaks up large quantities of monsoon rainfall but also gives birth to 20-odd main rivers and scores of tributaries that flow both east-wards and west-wards nourishing the earth. The Gadgil Committee had suggested classification according to usage and clearly identified the ecological dangers of allowing infra projects in ecologically sensitive zones. It had also recommended restrictions on mining and quarrying. All six states along the Western Ghats have refused to implement the recommendations in full. Perhaps, the visual of a well-made, pucca house being swallowed by the river in Kerala is proof enough of what can happen if the states continue to neglect warnings, allow encroachment of rivers, forests chopped off or for that matter, mining continues. Speaking about meteorology, as in the case of Uttarakhand, warnings about rainfall were given in Kerala too. Monsoon does not follow IMD's timetable of June 1 to September 30 and the withdrawal of monsoon is not yet complete. Plus, a low-pressure area on the Arabian Sea is not very unexpected. To a question, 'If this much rain in October in Kerala is common or not?' a senior meteorologist from IMD Pune, K.S. Hosalikar curtly said, "It is not uncommon." Low pressure areas in southeast Arabian Sea moved towards the coast of Kerala and Karnataka. This LPA does result in a lot of rain. And even when it was spread over several districts, it was actually a highly localised rainfall event in central Kerala and not widespread. "There are two different stories for climate change -- one at the regional level and the other at the global scale. But what is important is that the experts have warned how climate change will have an unequal impact in a given area. Localised extreme weather events are a cause of worry," Hosalikar said.Climate change or anthropogenic reasons, fact remains that the extreme weather events are set to rise. No one has disputed that.  IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-caused-devastating-rains-in-uttarakhand-kerala-at-this-time-of-year-327028

It said during the prevailing security milieu, a strict monitoring watch had been kept by the Pakistan navy to safeguard maritime frontiers of the nation.According to the statement, it’s the third such incident when an Indian submarine had been prematurely detected and tracked by the Pakistan navy’s long-range maritime patrol aircraft. The army also shared a short footage of the purported incident. A similar incident was last reported in March 2019 when the navy thwarted an attempted entry by an Indian submarine, the statement claimed.Sources in India shot down the claim by questioning the short footage of the purported incident put out by the Pakistani side. “The submarine has been shown with its snorkel outside, which means that it is unafraid of being detected. This is hardly the approach to be followed by a submarine that is entering hostile waters,” they said.New Delhi also rubbished as a lie the Pakistani statement claiming that this was the third such incident of an Indian submarine getting detected and tracked by Pakistan navy. But the implication of the sources here was Pakistan was circulating a dated footage of an Indian submarine with its periscope up, which meant either it was in an emergency or it wanted to announce its presence. In either case, it could have scarcely been threatening. In the best scenario, it was announcing its presence and in the worst seeking help, Indian sources said. — TNS/PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-rubbishes-paks-sub-claim-326787

It has also marginally increased troops and troop habitat on its side across the LAC in Arunachal Pradesh.Eastern Command chief Lt Gen Manoj Pande said: “The annual training exercises of the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) have increased. The duration of such exercises has also gone up. PLA’s reserve formulations that had moved (forward) continue to remain in position.” He said this while interacting with a group of mediapersons from Delhi.‘India focusing on tech use’We are maximising the use of technology, instead of increasing the number of troops along the LAC. — Lieutenant General Manoj Pande, Eastern Command Chief“The PLA is doing more integrated exercises in its traditional training areas,” Lt Gen Pande said. “India’s Mountain Strike Corps is now fully operational. Its logistics and combat units are fully equipped. We are also looking at the integrated battle group (IBG) model for the corps. The setting up of the IBG has been approved,” the Army Commander said.He said the idea was to maintain peace and tranquillity, besides remaining ready for any exigency.Both sides want to improve infrastructure close to the LAC, hence there is a marginal increase in the number of border defence troops, he said.General Pande said, “We have adequate forces in each sector, we are practising and rehearsing for various contingencies. Deployment has been strengthened in certain areas. We are maximising the use of technology, instead of increasing the number of troops along the LAC.”The Eastern Command is adding all-terrain vehicles, counter-drone technology and precision-guided ammunition, better radio sets, radars and night-vision equipment. “On the Indian side, we are running projects and there is no disparity with China,” he added.On Asaphila, he said there was some infrastructure development (essentially accommodation) on the Chinese side. It basically aims at accommodating more PLA troops. The number of patrols has increased marginally.About Naku La in Sikkim, he said, “We have had faceoffs, but we have been able to resolve most of them at the tactical level and the level of local commanders.”On Doklam, he said both sides were aware of the sensitivities and there had not been any major increase in troops, while infrastructure had remained what it was earlier.About Siliguri corridor, he said radicalisation and separatists can prove inimical to the safety of this corridor.

On the same date last year, the total number of pending Constitution Bench cases stood at 430 (44 “main matters” and 386 “connected matters”).Generally, the Supreme Court sits in Division Benches, comprising two or three judges. However, cases involving substantial questions of law with regard to interpretation of the Constitution are referred to a Constitution Bench consisting of five or more judges.In his capacity as the “master of roster”, the Chief Justice of India decides on the composition of Benches, including Constitution Benches.

It is being executed by No.3 Base Repair Depot, which is responsible for the maintenance and overhaul of Russian-origin helicopters.According to IAF officers, the work of refurbishing the fleet is expected to begin in December and only one helicopter will be handled at a time. The entire work will take about six or seven months to complete.After Mi-8 helicopters, which were earlier used for VVIP transport, exhausted their service lifespan and plans to replace them with 12 Italian Agusta Westland helicopters ran aground due to allegations of kickbacks, the IAF opted for modifying a few newly acquired Mi-17 V5s for the role.The modification included cabin refurbishment, furnishing, air-conditioning and soundproofing of the passenger cabin, fitting executive passenger seats as in commercial airliners, making provision for baggage compartments, a galley and a small toilet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iaf-to-refurbish-its-fleet-of-vvip-copters-326779

Reasons are too complex. — Zalmay Khalilzad, US DiplomatNot only did Khalilzad’s deal exclude Ashraf Ghani’s US-backed government, it gave generous concessions to the Taliban, including the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners in return for just 1,000 pro-Ghani captives.The man who wished to be the President of Afghanistan one day, say his critics, had sensed the turn of events two days before the Taliban takeover in Kabul and had drastically cut down his prolific social media presence.Khalilzad, a US diplomat, has long been a controversial figure for his involvement in “war on terror”. He also led Washington’s talks with the Taliban, which many see as the main precursor to the Pashtun-dominated group’s lightning victory in Afghanistan. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biden-sacks-khalilzad-as-special-afghan-envoy-326780

Sri Lanka was even better with 62.9 points in this category on the GFS Index 2021, a global report released by Economist Impact and Corteva Agriscience on Tuesday said.Ireland, Australia, the UK, Finland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Canada, Japan, France and the US shared the top rank with the overall GFS score in the range of 77.8 and 80 points on the index.The GFS Index was designed and constructed by London-based Economist Impact and is sponsored by Corteva Agriscience.The GFS Index measures the underlying drivers of food security in 113 countries, based on the factors of affordability, availability, quality and safety, and natural resources and resilience. It considers 58 unique food security indicators including income and economic inequality – calling attention to systemic gaps and actions needed to accelerate progress toward United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger by 2030.According to the report, India held 71st position with an overall score of 57.2 points on the GFS Index 2021 of 113 countries, fared better than Pakistan (75th position), Sri Lanka (77th Position), Nepal (79th position) and Bangladesh (84th position). But the country was way behind China (34th position).In the food affordability category, Pakistan (with 52.6 points) scored better than India (50.2 points). Sri Lanka was also better at 62.9 points on the GFS Index 2021.In case of availability of food, quality and safety as well as protecting natural resources for food production, India scored better than Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka on the GFS Index 2021, the report added.However, over the past 10 years, India’s incremental gains in overall food security score were lagging behind that of Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.India’s score improved only by 2.7 points to 57.2 in 2021 from 54.5 in 2012 when compared with Pakistan by 9 points (to 54.7 in 2021 from 45.7 in 2012) while that of Nepal by 7 points (to 53.7 points in 2021 from 46.7 points in 2012) and Bangladesh by 4.7 points (to 49.1 in 2021 from 44.4 points in 2012).China’s score improved by 9.6 points to 71.3 in 2021 from 61.7 in 2012, the report said.“The GFSI looks beyond hunger to identify the underlying factors affecting food insecurity around the world,” said Tim Glenn, Executive Vice-President and Chief Commercial Officer, Corteva Agriscience.The findings of GFS Index 2021 also showed that global food security has decreased for the second year in a row after seven years of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goal of achieving zero hunger by 2030.According to Pratima Singh, Head of the Global Food Security Index at Economist Impact, “The index shows that, while countries have made significant strides toward addressing food insecurity in the past 10 years, food systems remain vulnerable to economic, climatic, and geopolitical shocks. Action is imperative at all levels—local, national, and global—to end hunger and malnourishment and ensure food security for all.”In its global report, Economist Impact stated that the Index shows that to meet these present and emerging future challenges requires that investments in food security are sustained – from innovation in climate-resilient crop yields to investing in programs to assist the most vulnerable.

20-10-2021||Satya Prakash||421 Constitution Bench matters pending in Supreme Court||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 19There were 421 Constitution Bench matters, including the challenge to nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution, pending in the Supreme Court where 69,922 cases awaited adjudication as on October 1 this year.According to data officially released on the Supreme Court’s website, there were 271 Five-Judge Bench matters, 15 Seven-Judge Bench matters and 135 Nine-Judge Bench matters.The top court has categorised 49 of the 421 Constitution Bench cases as ‘main matters’, while the rest 372 have been described as ‘connected matters’.This is 132 Constitution Bench matters less than the October 1, 2019 figure of 553 – which included 56 ‘main matters’ and 497 ‘connected matters’. On the same date last year, the total number of pending Constitution Bench cases stood at 430 (44 ‘main matters’ and 386 ‘connected matters’).Generally, the Supreme Court sits in Division Benches comprising two or three judges. However, cases involving substantial questions of law with regard to interpretation of the Constitution are referred to a Constitution Bench consisting of five or more judges. In his capacity as the ‘master of roster’, the Chief Justice of India decides on the composition of Benches, including Constitution Benches. Once the Supreme Court clarifies the legal position on an important constitutional issue, it leads to early disposal of a large number of cases that otherwise hang fire.In August last year, petitions challenging the Centre’s decision to grant 10% reservation to economically weaker sections (EWS) of general category in public employment and education, including private educational institutions, were referred to a Constitution Bench. Similarly, the top court had in February 2019 referred the issue with regard to minority status of Aligarh Muslim University to a seven-judge Constitution Bench.Out of the total 69,922 cases pending in the top court, 51,581 were ‘admission matters’ while 18,341 were ‘regular matters’.Going by the categorisation done by the court, out of the 51,581 ‘admission matters’ – also described as ‘miscellaneous’, 37,735 were ready for hearing as all preliminaries i.e. pre-hearing formalities – had been completed.The rest 13,846 ‘admission matters’ categorised ‘incomplete miscellaneous’ were not ready for hearing as preliminaries such as payment of process fee, service of notice and completion of filing of necessary documents/pleadings were not complete.Similarly, of the 18,341 ‘regular hearing matters’, 18,272 were ready for hearing with all the necessary formalities having been completed. Only 69 of the ‘regular hearing matters’ weren’t ready for hearing as preliminaries had not been completed.In almost 20 per cent cases (19.9 % to be precise) preliminaries had not been completed leading to delay in hearing.Out of 69,922 pending matters, 13,915 matters (13,846 incomplete miscellaneous matters and 69 not ready regular hearing matters) were such matters which can’t be listed for ‘hearing’ before the Supreme Court, it has been officially stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/421-constitution-bench-matters-pending-in-supreme-court-326649
20-10-2021||New Delhi||Centre should listen to ‘right thinking people’ in BJP: Farmer leaders on Guv Malik’s offer of mediation||With Meghalaya Governor Satya Pal Malik offering to mediate between the agitating farmers and the Centre, farmer leaders said on Tuesday that they do need any mediation but the BJP government should listen to the “right thinking people” in the party and resume the dialogue, which is stalled since January.Malik, who has been supporting the protesting farmers, on Sunday asserted that he is ready to mediate if the Centre agrees to give legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP) for crops.“There is only one thing which will solve the entire issue. If the government agrees to give the MSP guarantee, I will mediate and convince the farmers,” Malik had said at an event in Rajasthan’s Jhunjhunu on Sunday.Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture (ASHA) believes that the “right-thinking people” in BJP should continue to put pressure on the leadership to fulfil the farmers’ demands.“I think that there is no mediation required between the farmers and the government. However, what right-thinking people in BJP should do is continue to put pressure on the party and its leadership for fulfilling the farmers’ demands,” Kuruganti said.She added that the refusal to fulfil the “legitimate, evidence-based demands” has no sound reasoning behind it.“These farmer-friendly voices in the party should also make sure that the morality bar of the party does not slip so low that it is irretrievable. They should ensure that (Minister of State) Ajay Mishra Teni is sacked and arrested,” she said.Echoing Kuruganti’s opinion, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), a part of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) and an influential group in western UP, said that Malik had offered support earlier as well but the BJP did not listen to him.It was, however, ready for anyone to act as a mediator if the demands are met.“We have two main demands. The Bills must be taken back and a law made to ensure MSP for crops. Satya Pal Malik or anyone who thinks they can mediate the issue are welcome,” BKU’s media in-charge Dharmendra Malik told PTI.He added that Malik, who hails from western Uttar Pradesh, had earlier also offered his advice to the Centre over the farmers’ issue but the BJP did not listen to him.“Instead of listening to him, his own party made him the Governor of Meghalaya and sent him there,” Malik added.Farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar of Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh said that mediation would have helped if the government did not know their demands and about the situation.“We don’t need mediation. The 11 rounds of talks we had with the government were without mediators and it’s not like they don’t know our demands. When they are clearly aware of our demands then it’s just them and us who need to sit down, talk and reach a decision,” Kohar told PTI.Farmers from different parts of the country have been camping at the Delhi borders since November 26 last year, demanding the repeal of the three central farm laws.While the farmers have been expressing fear that the laws would do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving them at the mercy of the corporations, the government has been projecting them as major agricultural reforms.With the last talk held on January 22, the 11 rounds of talks between the two parties have failed to break the deadlock.The Supreme Court had in January suspended the implementation of the laws.  Another farmer leader, Shiv Kumar Kakka, the convener of Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh, a constituent of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, also said that the government will never allow a mediator as it was adamant over not repealing the three farm laws.“Governor Malik is a good man. He has supported farmers earlier as well. But the government will never allow a mediator because they don’t want to repeal the laws.” —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-should-listen-to-right-thinking-people-in-bjp-farmer-leaders-on-guv-maliks-offer-of-mediation-326632
20-10-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19: India’s R-value below 1 since September, say researchers||India’s R-value, which reflects how rapidly the coronavirus pandemic is spreading, has remained below 1 since September, suggesting that the infection rate is declining, according to a study.The Reproduction number or R refers to how many people an infected person infects on an average. In other words, it tells how ‘efficiently’ a virus is spreading.An R-value smaller than 1 means the disease is spreading slowly. Conversely, if R is greater than 1, the number of infected people is increasing in each round - technically, this is what is called the epidemic phase.The bigger the number than 1, the faster the rate of spreading of the disease in the population.According to figures calculated by researchers of the Chennai-based Institute of Mathematical Sciences, the R-value of top 10 states with most number of active cases was below 1 till October 18.However, some of the cities continue to show a rising number of active cases. Kolkata has an R-value over 1, perhaps “unsurprising” given the mass gatherings during the (recently-concluded) Durga Puja, said Sitabhra Sinha, who is leading the research.Bengaluru also has R-value over 1 — it has been so ever since mid-September — while the R-values of Chennai, Pune and Mumbai are just below 1.The country’s R-value, calculated between September 25 and October 18, was 0.90.Between August 30 and September 3, the value was 1.11. It started declining since then — the R-value was 0.94 between September 4 and 7, 0.86 between September 11 and 15, 0.92 between September 14 and 19 and 0.87 between September 17 and 21, as per the study.After the brutal second wave of coronavirus between March to May this year, the daily Covid-19 cases have been on a decline.On Tuesday, India logged 13,058 new coronavirus infections, the lowest in 231 days, according to the Union Health Ministry’s data.The daily rise in new coronavirus infections has been below 30,000 for 25 straight days and less than 50,000 daily new cases have been reported for 114 consecutive days now.The active cases comprise 0.54 per cent of the total infections, the lowest since March 2020, while the national Covid-19 recovery rate was recorded at 98.14 per cent, the highest since March 2020, the ministry said.

20-10-2021||New Delhi||Zomato reinstates customer agent after TN customer's 'Hindi is national language' row||As online food delivery major Zomato faced flak over the national language issue, the company on Tuesday issued a clarification after a Tamil Nadu customer was told that 'Hindi is the national language'.A Zomato user named Vikash on Monday tweeted with screenshots that his order was missing an item and he was unable to get a refund due to a linguistic problem. Post that, the micro-blogging site was flooded with people criticising the company for forcing the language on customers.An ignorant mistake by someone in a support centre of a food delivery company became a national issue. The level of tolerance and chill in our country needs to be way higher than it is nowadays. Who's to be blamed here?  "An ignorant mistake by someone in a support centre of a food delivery company became a national issue. The level of tolerance and chill in our country needs to be way higher than it is nowadays. Who's to be blamed here?" CEO Deepinder Goyal wrote.The customer service representative with whom the user communicated told him that she is attempting to obtain a refund but that there is a "language barrier." In response, Vikash stated that since Zomato is available in Tamil Nadu, they should have engaged people who are fluent in the language.The CEO mentioned that we should all tolerate each other's imperfections. And appreciate each other's language and regional sentiments.Goyal also said that the company's call centre agents are young people, who are at the start of their learning curves and careers. They are not experts on languages and regional sentiments.He emphasised that Zomato loves Tamil Nadu just as much as they love the rest of the country.Having said that, we should all tolerate each other's imperfections. And appreciate each other's language and regional sentiments.Tamil Nadu – we love you. Just as much as we love the rest of the country. Not more, not less. We are all the same, as much as we are different.❤️  "Tamil Nadu -- we love you. Just as much as we love the rest of the country. Not more, not less. We are all the same, as much as we are different," he said.Goyal added that the company did not sack the customer service agent."We are reinstating the agent -- this alone is not something she should have been fired for. This is easily something she can learn and do better about going forward," Goyal wrote.

20-10-2021||Lucknow||Priyanka announces 40% tickets to women in UP polls||In a major decision that could prove to be a game-changer for the Congress, in particular and, Indian politics, in general, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, on Tuesday, announced that her party would give 40 per cent tickets to women in the upcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.She said that all women who want to bring about a change in the system, are welcome to come forward and contest elections."Any woman who wants to contest can give an application till October 15," she announced at a press conference.Priyanka said the decision was for the woman named Paro, who had held her hand in Prayagraj and had said that she wanted to join politics."This decision is for Vaishnavi in Chandauli and the sisters-in-law of two rape victims of Hathras and Unnao, who are fighting for justice and against the system."This is for every woman who wants to be heard -- whether it is Laxmi Valmiki of Lucknow who wants to be a doctor, the daughter of journalist Raman Kashyap who was killed in Lakhimpur Kheri violence."This is also for two women constables -- Madhu and Pooja, who arrested me in Sitapur and were with me till 4.a.m. Power today amounts to trampling over the weaker sections of society, primarily women," Priyanka said.She said that women were not only stronger but more compassionate and sensitive and could bring a change in the political system.Asked whether the same formula of 40 per cent reservation for women would be extended to the Congress-ruled states, including Punjab, Priyanka said, "I am in charge of UP and we have taken this decision here. If they (Punjab), they are welcome to implement the formula." She said that women were being divided on the basis of caste which weakened their battle for justice."A woman's struggle is not limited to a gas cylinder or Rs 2,000. It goes beyond that. We have to rise above the shackles of casteism and communalism and come together as a group," she said.Priyanka, when asked whether wives and daughters of leaders would not take advantage of this reservation, said, "What is wrong with that if it leads to empowerment. In Amethi, a village pradhan's wife contested and won elections. After some months, he met me and said that his wife has started making decisions in the house as well. This is empowerment." She said the Congress would help women fight elections and next time, they will be stronger. She further said that the candidates would be decided on the basis of merit.Priyanka, however, parried questions about the chief ministerial candidate of the Congress in Uttar Pradesh and whether she would contest elections."These issues will be decided later and we will let you know," she stated.Talking about the opposition onslaught on her, Priyanka said, "The other parties should get more creative when they attack me. Political tourist and Twitter leader have become stale," she said.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priyanka-announces-40-tickets-to-women-in-up-polls-326595

Dozens of tourists were stranded in some parts of the state.According to a rough estimate, around 100 pilgrims from different parts of Gujarat who had gone to Uttarakhand for the Chardham Yatra were stranded following heavy rains and landslides, Gujarat Revenue Minister Rajendra Trivedi said.The National Disaster Response Force has rescued over 300 people from flood-affected areas of Uttarakhand, the federal force said on Tuesday.The NDRF has deployed 15 teams in the state.Rainfall was reported from other parts of the country as well including Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, according to the IMD, which forecast an intense spell of rain over east and northeast till Wednesday, and south peninsular region during next four-five days.Authorities in the national capital said Prof Joginder Singh Marg in the western part of the city had been closed after the road caved in.A 35-year-old woman and her mother-in-law died in Uttar Pradesh’s Fathepur after a wall of their house collapsed following heavy rains.In Bareilly, also in UP, two labourers died of electrocution in Bisalpur road after coming in contact with a solar panel following heavy rains, police said.In West Bengal, the Met department said heavy rainfall is very likely to continue till Thursday morning even as the low-pressure system that developed over the Gangetic Basin in the southern part of the state moved to Bihar, parts of which received heavy rains during the day.The weatherman warned of extremely heavy rainfall over Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Alipurduar till Wednesday morning and downpour till Thursday over all sub-Himalayan districts.The IMD forecast more rain on Wednesday in Odisha, which has already been battered by low-pressure area-induced downpour for the last three days. Fishermen were advised not to venture into the Bay of Bengal for the next 48 hours.Down south in Kerala, after a relative respite of two days, the IMD Tuesday issued an Orange Alert for 11 districts of Kerala indicating heavy rainfall.

20-10-2021||Ajay Banerjee||China has increased its military exercises facing India’s eastern sector, says army commander||Tribune News ServiceTenga (Arunachal Pradesh), October 19China has increased the number of its military exercises facing India’s eastern sector; it has also marginally added troops and added to troop habitat on its side across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Arunachal Pradesh.Eastern Army Commander Lt Gen Manoj Pande, in an interaction with a group of mediapersons from Delhi while referring to changes seen across the LAC, said: “The annual training exercises of the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) have increased and also the duration of exercises has gone up. The reserve formulations of the PLA that had moved (forward) continue to remain in position.”To a question if the location of these exercises was closer to the LAC or south of the Tsangpo river, the Eastern Army Commander said the PLA exercises are in their traditional training areas. “The PLA is doing more integrated exercises of its troops”, Lt Gen Pande said.An official later explained that this included that rocket forces, air force and land forces are doing joint exercises.On being asked about the changes on the Indian side, specifically on the Mountain Strike Corps, the Army Commander said, “The Mountain Strike Corps is now fully operationalised; its logistics units and combat units are fully equipped. Its operational philosophy has stabilised. It has carried out validation and integrated training with other formations.”“We are also looking at the Integrated Battle Group (IBG) model for the Mountain Strike Crops.  The setting up of IBG for the Corps has been approved and the Mountain Strike has come up as the capability desired when it was approved a decade ago. The IBG addresses the changing character of warfare which is that our forces remain agile and lean,” he said.On being asked about the situation along the LAC, the Army Commander said the idea is to maintain peace and tranquillity but remain alert and ready for any exigency. “Both sides want to make infrastructure close to the LAC, hence there is a marginal increase in number of border defence troops,” General Pande said.On the level of preparedness, Gen Pande said, “We have adequate forces in each sector to deal with any contingency and are practicing and rehearsing for various contingencies that may come about. In certain areas deployment has been strengthened.“The eastern command is adding all terrain vehicles, counter drone technology and precision guided ammunition. We are also looking at better radio set, better radars and night vision capability and artificial intelligence. We are looking at drones and counter drone technology,” he said.“On the Indian side, we are running projects and there is no disparity with China,” he added.Addressing the issue of Aspahilla, the Commander said some infrastructure development had been done on the Chinese side. “It is essentially habitat that has allowed more number of PLA troops getting stationed there. The number of patrols has increased marginally,” he said.About Naku La in Sikkim, he said, “We have had face-offs but we have been able to resolve most of them at the tactical level and level of local commanders.”On Doklam, he said both sides were aware on sensitivities and there had not been any major increase while infrastructure had remained what it was earlier.About the challenges of radicalisation and  separatists, he said, “The Siliguri corridor is sensitive to us. We have set up a joint coordination centre to the Siliguri corridor.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-has-increased-its-military-exercises-facing-indias-eastern-sector-says-army-commander-326572
