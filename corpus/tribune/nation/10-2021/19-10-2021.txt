19-10-2021||New Delhi||India occupies top spot globally in emissions related to crop burning: Report||India is ranked at the top in emissions related to crop burning, accounting for 13 per cent of total global emissions for the 2015-2020 period, according to a new report released by climate tech startup Blue Sky Analytics, which is also part of global coalition “Climate TRACE”.Blue Sky Analytics, the Indian climate tech startup founded by an IIT alumnus, also pointed towards a 12.2-per cent contribution by India to cropland fire emissions in 2020.The data in the report reveals new insights into recent trends in biomass fires, including emissions from forest and crop residue fires in India. For example, the data verifies the downward trend in crop fires being observed between 2016 and 2019, citing a reduction in the GHG emissions due to cropland fires by 11.39 per cent in the said period.However, it also points to an increase in emissions by 12.8 per cent in 2019-20, increasing India’s global contribution to 12.2 per cent.Climate TRACE is a global coalition with a mission to accelerate climate action by providing independent high-resolution and near-real-time (GHG) emissions data. Its innovative approach fills critical knowledge gaps for all countries that rely on the patchwork system of self-reporting that currently serves as the basis for most existing emissions inventories.“For effective climate action, it is essential to have an independent, system-level view of emissions. This is especially critical for sources like fires, which are rapidly increasing in frequency and scale, but whose emissions are still poorly tracked and accounted for in most multi-sector inventories,” said Abhilasha Purwar, an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) alumnus and the founder and CEO of Blue Sky Analytics.The emissions estimates from Blue Sky Analytics cover both fires caused by human activities, including burning in forest areas for conversion to agricultural land or of crop residues and wildfire activity, producing a comprehensive picture of fire emissions.By combining multiple satellite data sources for active fire identification and characteristics with higher resolution global land cover maps, these estimates supplement the existing country-level reporting methods, which rely primarily on seasonal estimations and ground measurements of the burned area.“For far too long, climate action has been hindered by a lack of independent, verifiable data on emissions. Climate TRACE is built on the notion that we can only manage what we can measure,” explained former US vice-president and Climate TRACE coalition convening member Al Gore.“We are helping to create a level-playing field for everyone who wants to take an active role in reducing emissions—from government ministers and regulators to investors and business leaders to journalists and citizen activists. This new era of radical transparency will put everything out into the open,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-occupies-top-spot-globally-in-emissions-related-to-crop-burning-report-326658

19-10-2021||New Delhi||Experts explain what is causing heavy rains that killed dozens in Uttarakhand, Kerala over few days||A confluence of cyclonic storms forming in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea is among the biggest reasons behind heavy rains in different parts of the country over the past few days that have claimed dozens of lives in Uttarakhand, Kerala and other states, experts said on Tuesday.Climate experts also warn the intensity of rains in Kerala and Uttarakhand is “alarming” and must draw immediate attention towards “climate emergency”.“The latest rains in Kerala are a result of a normal climatic event called retreating monsoon that happens every year. However, the intensity of rains there and in Uttarakhand is alarming and must draw our attention to the severity of climate emergency.“We have seen a steady rise in the number of adverse climatic events over the past few years and as a tropical country, I believe it is time India takes solid steps to help meet the climate targets as events since the past few years and this trend seems to be getting worsened,” said Kamal Narayan Omer, CEO, Integrated Health and Wellbeing Council (IHW Council).Ishteyaque Ahmed, Senior Climate Campaigner, Greenpeace India, said these rains were a consequence of the cyclonic storms from the east and the west and can lead to huge environmental losses and derail food security of the country.“Rising oceanic temperatures can strengthen otherwise weak cyclones and make them deadlier than expected. India is facing this crisis from three sides. In the last few days cyclonic storms are continuously forming in the Bay of Bengal as well as in the Arabian Sea.“The confluence of such eastern and western storms is among the biggest causes of such disastrous rains in different parts of the country. These untimely erratic rains, responsible for big human and environmental losses can derail the food and nutritional security initiatives of the country, which is already at the brink of a major food and nutrition crisis,” Ahmed said.He also said that more such extreme weather events can occur in the future.“In a transitional phase, it is next to impossible to predict for the future, but seemingly rising oceanic temperatures and destruction of floral and faunal aquatic lives, more frequent and frightening extreme weather events cannot be ruled out,” he said.According to V Vinoj, Assistant Professor, IIT Bhubaneswar, states and the country as whole need to be “climate smart”. He suggested specific warning system to be installed to tackle the climate situation better.“It is now well-known that anthropogenic climate change will lead to extreme weather patterns. Therefore, it is now imperative that their impacts on life and property are minimised by following locally relevant adaptation measures. In parallel, efforts on mitigation efforts should be hastened so as to slow climate change.“A specific warming system taking in to consideration the local vulnerabilities will go a long way in saving lives. In addition, adaptation measures, again taking climate resilience as the central issue will be beneficial in the long run. In summary, our country, states and cities should be climate smart,” he said.Incessant rains have claimed at least 28 lives in Uttarakhand in the last two days, razing houses to the ground and leaving many trapped in the debris.Nainital was cut off from the rest of the state with three roads leading to the popular tourist spot blocked due to a series of landslides.Landslides have blocked the exits in the town and electricity, telecom and internet connectivity in Nainital district was also hit badly.The death toll in incidents related to heavy rains, including landslides and flash floods in Kerala rose to 27 on Monday. Meanwhile, a red alert has been issued for 11 dams across Kerala as water levels have breached the danger mark in several areas.Heavy rains are again expected in the state between October 20 and 24.

19-10-2021||New Delhi||Coal crisis: Number of power projects with less than 4-day coal stock dips to 58||The coal stock situation at thermal power projects has improved further as the number of non-pit head projects having less than four days of coal (supercritical stock) reduced to 58 on Monday from 69 a week ago, government data showed.According to latest coal stock data of the Central Electricity Authority (CEA), the number of non-pit head projects having less than four days of coal was 58 on October 18 and 69 on October 11.The data showed that the number of plants with supercritical stock was 61 this Sunday (October 17). Thus, the coal stock situation is inching towards normalcy.The improvement in the coal stock situation assumes significance in view of the ongoing shortage of the dry fuel at thermal power plants in the country.The Central Electricity Authority monitors coal stock situation of 135 thermal power plants with cumulative generation capacity of over 165 GW.The data also showed that the number of power plants with zero days of coal has come down to 13 as of Monday with cumulative installed generation capacity of 11,710 MW, compared to 15 with 15,290 MW capacity a week back.The number of the plants with one day of coal stock has increased to 28 with 34,795 MW capacity as on October 18, compared to 27 with 35,360 MW capacity on October 11.The number of plants with two days of coal decreased to 18 (with 27,490 MW capacity) from 20 (22,755 MW) a week ago.The number of plants with three days of coal also came down to 12 (with 16,874 MW capacity) from 21 (27,014 MW) a week ago.The number of plants with four days of coal has decreased to 18 with 20,725 MW capacity as of Monday, from 20 with 25,840 MW capacity a week ago, showing improvement in dry fuel stock.The number of plants with five days of coal has increased to 12 (12,840 MW capacity) from five (4,105 MW) a week ago.The power ministry data also showed improvement in the power shortage situation as it came down to 2,060 MW on October 18 from 6,857 MW a week back.Amid the coal shortage at power plants, the peak power shortage had moderated to 986 MW on October 15, in sharp contrast to 11,626 MW on October 7.The 11,626 MW peak power shortage on October 7 was the highest during the first half of this month.As per experts, power demand further moderated from last weekend with the onset of autumn and heavy rains in many parts of the country.They opined that the coal stock situation at power plants would further improve in coming days with government’s efforts to scale up supplies.Earlier last week, the power ministry had stated that the capacity of units under outage due to low coal stocks reduced from 11 GW on October 12 to 5 GW on October 14.

19-10-2021||New Delhi||India-Pak T20 World Cup match should be called off in view of civilian killings in Kashmir: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday said the cricket match between India and Pakistan at the T-20 World Cup should be cancelled in view of the recent killing of civilians by terrorists in Kashmir.Addressing a press conference, AAP MLA Atishi said the match should not be held until Pakistan stops sponsoring terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.She also sought to know Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s opinion on this issue.“We are seeing repeated attacks on Indians in Kashmir. There should not be a cricket match with Pakistan under these circumstances. Our prime minister will agree to this,” Atishi said.The MLA was asked if her party supports demands for cancellation of the India-Pakistan match at the T-20 World Cup in view of the recent killing of civilians by terrorist in Kashmir.“I am sure that not only the AAP but even the BJP and its leadership as well as the prime minister will agree that until Pakistan stops sponsoring terror attacks in India territory, there should not be any cricket match between India and Pakistan,” she said.The AAP leader said when Modi was in opposition, he used to raise this issue, asking why should there be a cricket match between India and Pakistan when Pakistan-sponsored terrorism is taking place in Indian territory.“Today when Pakistan sponsored terror attacks are happening, can we just sit down and watch? What is the opinion of our prime minister?” she said.So far in this month, 11 civilians have been killed by terrorists in Kashmir. On Sunday, terrorists had shot dead two workers from Bihar and injured another after barging into their accommodation in Kulgam in south Kashmir.

19-10-2021||Vibha Sharma||Top honour for Indian environmental historian||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 19The American Historical Association has announced the winners for 2021. Vice Chancellor and Professor of History and Environmental Studies, Krea University, Mahesh Rangarajan (former HoD, Ashoka University), has been made the 'Honorary Foreign Member' of the society for exhaustive work in his academic field. The previous honorary overseas members from India include eminent historians Sir Jadunath Sarkar, Prof Romila Thapar and Prof Ramachandra Guha. An author and co-author of several books and papers, Rangarajan talks to The Tribune on the honour, his work, history and its correlation with the past, present and future of environment, upcoming COP-26 and also the manmade disaster unfolding in ecologically-sensitive Kerala and Uttarakhand.    What does this honour mean to you? What do you think is its significance for the country?It is a recognition for my teachers at the universities of Delhi and Oxford where I studied and for my colleagues now at Krea University and also at Ashoka and Delhi University where I taught earlier; equally so for students and fellow researchers. The scholarship of history in India is not new but environmental themes have picked up pace in the last few decades. My own work on forests and wildlife, nature and nationalism, ecology and empire is only one of a rich mosaic of work by many. History and environmental studies: how have you correlated the diverse subjects in your works? The search for peace with nature is a major challenge of our times. It also requires us to ask when and where the battles with and about nature began or when there have been times of peace and cooperation. So, the lion was common enough near Delhi to be shot in 1857-58 but by 1900 was only found in and near Gir in Gujarat. Tigers were shot for sport till just about fifty years ago when a nationwide effort came in the nick of time. Regional pride helped the former and kind of ecological patriotism in the “Indian” tiger helped the latter.But we also face ironies. Forests are vital for livelihood but the Adivasis and marginal people were seen most so in the British imperial era as destroyers. Kipling's Mowgli grew up (in the novel) to be a forest guard. How do we get over our mindset? For a student of history, the past is not a mystery but a vital resource in terms of stories that can inform us for today and the tomorrows to come. Historians have studied states, society and economy: ecology and environment are now vital to the wider picture. In rethinking the role and relations with nature you may need to revisit much else besides.In today's context of certain changes in climate, how does your work help in bringing awareness?Scholarship, if accessible, can and will influence public debate. For me the book ‘Environmental issues in India, a reader’ and the Hindi version were a big learning as these issues came up in first year university students’ lives. It was an edited collection. There is no direct link but there is a large efflorescence of such scholarship and it is inspired by movements for change. Climate change is not to be seen in isolation. The nitrogen cycle and its changes are as important as the carbon cycle. Vanishing species affect the life support system. Chemical contamination means there are very few cultures across the skies in India. The question is why and how all this happened and how there can be corrections. As you say, awareness of the past can inform us for the future.What is the solution for man-made disasters unfolding in ecologically sensitive states like Kerala and Uttarakhand?It is not the task of a historian to suggest answers. It is to help inform us to ask better questions. Most of all we may wish to ask how a land and water scape that has sustained humans for centuries, even millennia in south Asia, often becomes unsafe and unlivable. Some of the drivers such as permanent construction on the sea shore at the water’s edge or in areas prone to floods are very recent. So, there is a need to learn critically from the past. In other cases, as with satellite imagery and modern climate studies, we may have to draw on recent insights. There is no silver bullet, only intelligent approaches; and no one easy answer but knowledge-based adaptation.Your views on the upcoming COP-26 and India's stand vis-a-vis developed nations.The planet is one but the fossil fuel age means different nations, indeed different sets of people affect the biosphere in vastly different ways. How to get cleaner energy may need sharing knowledge, and technology. But it also means keeping the energy poor and resource poor in the picture and not imposing new burdens on them. There is now more resolve across the world but we may need to rethink a lot of basics. What is growth for? What kind of economic growth can lessen destruction of the life support systems?Over the past few years there has been a raging debate over India's history and how it has been portrayed. As a historian, what is your opinion?Debate is always welcome. There is no one way to write history since human society has many aspects and dimensions. To me environmental history is as much about cultures, economies, states and people as it is about animals, mountains, cities and rivers. It helps to have a sense of both curiosity and humility, both important in a discipline where we have more to learn than all that we know.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/top-honour-for-indian-environmental-historian-326589

19-10-2021||New Delhi||FabIndia withdraws Jashn-e-Riwaaz promo after right-wing backlash||Clothing brand FabIndia has removed a promotional capsule about its new festive line after a backlash from right-wing groups.While the brand was accused of "defacing" the Hindu festival of Diwali by naming its festive collection as Jashn-e-Riwaaz (celebration of tradition), the company insisted that it is not a Diwali collection, which will be soon launched under 'Jhilmil si Diwali' promo.FabIndia was trolled on social media for what some said was unnecessarily uplifting secularism and Muslim ideologies in a Hindu festival, saying it hurt their religious sentiments.After it put on Twitter the Jashn-e-Riwaaz collection on October 9, some social media users called for a boycott of the brand, making their campaign one of the top trends."We at FabIndia have always stood for the celebration of India with its myriad traditions in all hues," a company spokesperson said."Our current capsule of products under the name Jashn-e-Riwaaz is a celebration of Indian traditions. The phrase means that, literally. The capsule is not our Diwali Collection of products. Our Diwali collection is called 'Jhilmil si Diwali' is yet to be launched."Jashn-e-Riwaaz is a phrase in Urdu, a language that was born in India.The tweet, which went viral on Monday, said: "As we welcome the festival of love and light, Jashn-e-Riwaaz by Fabindia is a collection that beautifully pays homage to Indian culture".This was deleted after the backlash.BJP Yuva Morcha President Tejasvi Surya was among those who slammed the ad in a post on Twitter."Deepavali is not Jash-e-Riwaaz. This deliberate attempt of abrahamisation of Hindu festivals, depicting models without traditional Hindu attires, must be called out. And brands like @fabindiaNews must face economic cost for such deliberate misadventures," he said on Monday afternoon.Author Shefali Vaidya, known for her views supporting right-wing, slammed FabIndia for 'de-Hinduising' festivals.“Wow @FabindiaNews great job at de-Hinduising Deepawali! Call it a 'festival of love and light', title the collection 'Jashn-e-Riwaaz', take Bindis off foreheads of models but expect Hindus to buy your overpriced, mass-produced products in the name of 'homage to Indian culture'!" she tweeted.Soon hashtag #BoycottFabindia began trending. FabIndia did not say why it removed the tweet.The ethnic retail behemoth is not the first brand to face right-wing attacks and buckle under pressure.Tata Group's jewellery brand Tanishq was forced to withdraw an advertisement that showed an interfaith couple at a baby shower organised for the Hindu bride by her Muslim in-laws.It withdrew the advertisement after trolling soon spread to physical threats to company employees and stores.Clothing brand Manyavar, too, was at the receiving end when its advertisement featuring Bollywood actor Alia Bhatt in wedding attire, appeared to question an old tradition.Established in 1960, FabIndia sources its products from villages helping to provide and sustain rural employment in India.According to reports, the products are currently produced by over 40,000 artisans and craftspeople across India.In 2019, a Holi ad by Surf Excel had received similar flak by certain groups, as it showed children of two different religions celebrating the festival of colours.

19-10-2021||Washington||US court dismisses plea filed by Nirav Modi, associates||A bankruptcy court in New York has dismissed a petition of fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi and his associates, seeking dismissal of fraud allegations against them.The allegations were made by Richard Levin, the court-appointed trustee of three US corporations - Firestar Diamond, Fantasy Inc and A Jaffe -indirectly owned by Nirav Modi previously.Levin had also sought a minimum compensation of USD 15 million for “harm” suffered by the debtors of Modi and his associates Mihir Bhansali and Ajay Gandhi.Southern District of New York Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean H Lane issued the order last Friday, in a major blow to the Indian fugitive and his accomplices.“SDNY Bankruptcy Court Judge Lane in a clear decision denied defendants Modi, Bansali and Gandhi's motions to dismiss US Trustee Richard Levin's amended complaint in the adversary proceeding arising out of Modi's initial chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, alleging fraud, breach of fiduciary duties, RICO and related state law claims,” Indian American attorney Ravi Batra told PTI.Explaining the 60-page order, Batra said Modi ploughed his profits back into his own company as additional sales to falsely raise the stock price/company valuation by setting up a scheme to defraud Punjab National Bank and others of over USD1 billion. “But to get the ill-gotten funds by bank fraud out of his companies, he engaged in a separate fraud to hide those withdrawals for personal benefit as if they were ordinary business transactions,” Batra said.According to the court order, Levin's petition sought to recover damages for harm inflicted by Modi and his two accomplishes on the debtors and their estates as a result of the his six-year extensive international fraud, money laundering and embezzlement scheme. It said from early 2011 to early 2018, Modi and his associates orchestrated and carried out a scheme to “obtain loans, credits or other funds under false pretences and without collateral” from numerous banks, including the PNB.

Besides, an ongoing “infrastructure push” is speeding up troop movement, logistics and supplies.The Tezpur-Bomdilla-Tawang-Bumla axis — that is the area of operations of 4 Corps headquartered at Tezpur — has upgraded technologies to keep “an eye” across the LAC. The idea is to harness technology and upgrade it to avoid the need to physically deploy forward for surveillance.“Enhancing technical capabilities and improving road infrastructure is the focus,” said Maj General Zubin A Minwalla, Commander of 5 Mountain Division.Series of assets like electronic radars, air-based sensors, satellite imagery, surveillance planes, UAVs, ground-based sensors provide real time feed at the headquarters of the 5 Mountain Division at Tenga.The feed is integrated seamlessly, collated, deciphered and analysed by a dedicated team. The imagery is clear and provides a “heads up” to commanders on ground to deal with an emerging situation.A high-speed broadband line is used to transmit information collected from across the LAC to the unit at Tenga.On infrastructure front, the BRO is creating alternate road axis to Tawang located at altitude of 10,000 feet. The Tezpur-Tawang road has been traditional road route. A new route from Itanagar joins the existing road at “Zero point” north of the Elephant Pass. It provides access from the eastern Assam and shortens the supply route.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/enhanced-tech-to-keep-eye-across-lac-326312

19-10-2021||Rupa (Arunachal Pradesh)||India giving major push to infra development for quick mobilisation of troops in Arunachal sector||India is giving a major push to boosting connectivity and use of high-tech surveillance along the nearly 1,350-km Line of Actual Control in the Arunachal Pradesh sector to ensure quick mobilisation of troops and heavy weaponry to deal with any eventuality in the face of the standoff with China in eastern Ladakh.As part of the mega plan, around 20 bridges, a number of tunnels, airbases and several key roads are being developed in strategically key areas in Arunachal Pradesh to bolster the overall military preparedness, officials said on Monday.Major General Zubin A Minwalla, General-Officer-Commanding of the 5 Mountain Division, said the focus has been to further strengthen road infrastructure as well as the use of high-tech surveillance equipment to create more battlefield transparency.The 5 Mountain Division is tasked with keeping vigil over areas from Bum La to west of Bhutan and is considered one of the most critical formations of the Indian Army.“The adversary cannot surprise us now. We are confident of what our goal is and we are not going to be surprised by them,” he told a group of reporters while elaborating on steps being taken by the Indian Army to boost military preparedness.“We are following an approach of confidence in dealing with any possible situation. The Indian Army’s focus has been on maintaining the sovereignty of the land,” Maj Gen Minwalla said.He said there has been a “tremendous push” on infrastructure development by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) and the civilian government.“There is no such increase in deployment (of troops). We are creating more (battle field) transparency through technology. We are using technology to increase our awareness of the entire situation,” he said.Maj Gen Minwalla said besides road connectivity, the larger push has been on use of high-tech equipment for surveillance and to enhance assets of the Army Aviation so that they can act as “force multiplier”.“We are giving more push in terms of enhancing capabilities by our own means of  technology and processes in terms of infrastructure,” he said.“We are not reacting. We have our own plans and are confident of meeting our own goals and targets in terms of capability building,” he said when asked whether India’s overall approach is reactionary towards China.Anant Kumar Singh, an engineer with the Border Roads Organisation, said around 20 bridges are being constructed besides many key roads and tunnels.He said the tunnels in Nechiphu and Sela pass will be ready much ahead of their scheduled timeline for completion in August next year.The major road projects include construction of a road from Zero Point near Tenga to Itanagar and another one called ‘Western Axis road from Shergaon to Tawang.“These two roads will be crucial for overall capability enhancement,” said Singh.As tensions with China increased following the eastern Ladakh row last year, India ramped up overall deployment of troops along the LAC besides speeding up infrastructure development to gain tactical advantage.The Army is also cranking up its day and night surveillance over the LAC in the region using a fleet of remotely piloted aircraft.A sizeable fleet of Israeli-made Heron medium-altitude long endurance drones is carrying out round-the-clock surveillance over the LAC in the mountainous terrain and sending crucial data and images to command and control centres.Along with the drones, the Indian Army’s aviation wing has also been deploying the Weapon System Integrated (WSI) variant of the Advanced Light Helicopter Rudra in the region, adding more teeth to its tactical missions in the region, they said.The government is also working on connecting Tawang with a railway network as part of a decision to enhance infrastructure in the region.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.The tension escalated following a deadly clash in Galwan Valley on June 15 last year.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in the Gogra area in August and in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in February.The last round of military talks on October 10 ended in a stalemate following which both sides blamed each other for the impasse.In a strong statement after the 13th round of talks, the Indian Army said the “constructive suggestions” made by it at the negotiations were neither agreeable to the Chinese side nor could Beijing provide any “forward-looking” proposals.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.

19-10-2021||Bengaluru||WHO says it ‘cannot cut corners’ in approving India's Covaxin shot||The World Health Organisation on Monday asked for further data from India's Bharat Biotech to consider the company's request for an emergency-use listing for its Covid-19 shot, saying the WHO could not "cut corners" in making a decision.Bharat Biotech, which developed Covaxin with an Indian state research body, started sharing data with the WHO from early July.The vaccine was given emergency-use authorisation in India in January even before the completion of a late-stage trial, which later found the shot to be 78% efficacious.Without a WHO nod, the two-dose Covaxin is unlikely to be accepted as a valid vaccine around the world and would complicate travel plans for tens of millions of Indians who have taken it. Covaxin accounts for 11% of the 985.5 million total doses administered in India, and has also been exported."We are aware that many people are waiting for WHO’s recommendation for Covaxin to be included in the #COVID19 Emergency Use Listing, but we cannot cut corners," the WHO said on Twitter."Before recommending a product for emergency use, we must evaluate it thoroughly to make sure it is safe and effective." The WHO was expecting "one additional piece of information from the company today", it added, without specifying.Bharat Biotech, which has struggled to meet production timelines for Covaxin, did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.WHO Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan said on Sunday its technical advisory group would meet on October 26 to consider the listing for Covaxin. He said the WHO's goal was to "have a broad portfolio of vaccines approved for emergency use & to expand access to populations everywhere".India is the world's biggest producer of vaccines, with a capacity to make more than 3 billion Covid shots a year, mainly the AstraZeneca one.
