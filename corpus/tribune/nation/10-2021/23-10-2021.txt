The game of cricket and the game of terror cannot be played at the same time”.Queried on his statement that repatriation of black money will reduce fuel prices, Ramdev said he had suggested that the price of petrol should be in line with the prices of crude oil and proposed lower taxation.“The government has to continue with welfare programmes of the national interest and it has to also handle various financial challenges. Because of these factors, the government is not able to reduce taxes. However, someday this dream will come true,” he said.

23-10-2021||Guwahati||Danger to stability in South Asia due to China’s ambitions, Sino-Pak nexus ‘anti-Indian’: Gen Rawat||Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat on Saturday said China’s ambitions and aspirations to global power presented an “omnipresent danger” to stability in South Asia.China is making “huge” inroads in South Asia and in the Indian Ocean region to strengthen its position as an emerging global power he said, while delivering the first Ravi Kant Singh Memorial Lecture here.“Of late, we are witnessing a geo-strategic competition and huge investment by China in the region to create a favourable posture to provide sufficient security to its interests,” he said.Bangladesh and Myanmar have been the largest recipients of Chinese military aid in the recent past, along with significant investments in Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives “to gain strategic foothold (in the region),” he said.He added that China’s foray into Myanmar and Bangladesh are not in India’s national interest as these are attempts to ‘engulf India’.“There exists an omnipresent danger of regional strategic instability,” Rawat said, adding that it has the potential of ‘threatening India’s territorial integrity and strategic importance’.The General also said Pakistan’s state sponsored terrorism as well as by non-state actors against India is a stumbling block to peace process between the two countries.He described the ‘partnership’ between Pakistan and China on a range of issues, from China providing military hardware to Pakistan and supporting it in international fora, as an ‘anti-India nexus’.Later addressing a press conference, the chief of defence staff said border issues with China has to be viewed in its totality, and not as issues pertaining to the Ladakh sector or North Eastern states.“In 2020, there was a little bit of problem (between India and China). Issues are being resolved with talks at different levels, from military to political level,” he said.Rawat also said such issues have cropped up in the past too between the two neighbours, but have been resolved.“There are suspicions between the two countries, and hence, it takes time to resolve the issues. The people must have faith and confidence in the system and the armed forces,” he added.He said as a measure to counter China’s influence in the region, India has to step up its engagement in neighbouring countries.He said, “Chinese have a habit of using money power to gain popularity in a country (they are trying to influence). But as our prime minister has given a clarion call, we believe in security and growth for all.”“We have to tell our neighbours that we are here as permanent friends and engage with them on equal terms and we consider all neighbours as equal partners in development,” he added.Rawat also emphasized on the need to exploit cultural linkages with the neighbouring countries to strengthen ties.On the country’s defence preparedness, Rawat said, “We are standing strong.”He said there is adequate defence and arms systems at India’s disposal, and the government has allowed the armed forces to procure needed armaments by invoking emergency powers.“No questions are being asked (by the government) as long as our security mechanism improves,” he added.Commenting on the recent violence against security forces as well as civilians in Jammu and Kashmir, Rawat said, “Our western adversary (Pakistan) is indulging in a proxy war with us. They will do anything to disturb peace in Jammu and Kashmir.” He also said the killings in Jammu & Kashmir were an attempt by the neighbouring country to spread fear among the people.“We should not fear them or fall prey to such traps,” he said, adding that any possible exodus of people from J&K should be stopped.To counter Pakistan’s designs, the chief of defence staff said the intelligence network is being strengthened.Rawat added that the freedom of movement that people in Jammu & Kashmir were starting to enjoy in recent times may be disrupted due to the current situation and urged for people’s cooperation in tackling the situation.

All three were arrested.“Chandrasekhar was the mastermind of this fraud. He has been a part of the crime world since the age of 17. He has multiple FIRs against him and is presently lodged in the Rohini jail (in connection with the case lodged by the Delhi Police),” the ED had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gifted-luxury-car-to-bollywood-actor-nora-fatehi-says-conman-sukesh-chandrasekhar-328672

23-10-2021||New Delhi||India to join G-20 ‘troika’ at Rome next week||Though at least half a dozen leaders have dropped out, next week’s G-20 summit is important for India as it will be the in-waiting Chair of the world’s most powerful economic grouping from this meeting in Rome.India will hold the G20 presidency from December 1, 2022, and will convene the G20 leaders' summit in 2023 for the first time. Indonesia will take over the chair from Italy and India will join both as the “G-20 troika” which comprises past, present and future chairs of G-20.Though the Summit is scheduled to be held from October 30-31, Prime Minister Modi may depart for Rome a day earlier on October 28 as his audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican has been confirmed for the next day. The MEA was among the several foreign offices that had been trying for a call-on by their leader on the Pope on the sidelines of the G-20 summit.Prime Minister Modi will then attend the 26th meeting of a UN sponsored meeting on climate change in Glasgow. There are indications that he may stay on in Glasgow for another day to co-chair an event with UK PM Boris Johnson.PM Modi has been leading India's representation at all successive G20 summits since 2014. India is a founder-member of the G20 which has not changed in size since its inception in 1999.At the G-20 meeting, there are expectations that the threads will be picked up on Afghanistan after the 10-country meeting with a Taliban delegation in Moscow and the earlier talks at the UN where generous humanitarian donations were announced. The Taliban has yet shown no inclination of meeting the prerequisites for recognising their dispensation in Kabul—an inclusive government accommodating Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazara leaders.The setting for the discussions at the G-20 this time will be different because the Chinese and Russian Presidents are not attending. Though they will be represented by senior leaders, their absence could enable the G-20 push through a demand to allow aid agencies to receive humanitarian aid from overseas donors.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-join-g-20-troika-at-rome-next-week-328665

23-10-2021||Kolkata||Modi govt trying to confuse people with campaign on Covid inoculation figures: Adhir Chowdhury||Senior Congress leader Adhir Chowdhury on Saturday alleged that the BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to “confuse” the people of the country with its campaign on COVID-19 vaccination figures.The leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha claimed that Modi’s campaign on administration of 100 crore vaccine doses was projected in a way that made it look like 100 crore people have been inoculated.“On completion of 100 crore vaccine doses, 100 places were lit up. And the Prime Minister is trying to send across the message that 100 crore people have been fully vaccinated. This is not the fact,” he said in a video posted on Facebook.Chowdhury, who is also the West Bengal Congress chief, noted that India’s population stands at 139 crore, of which 106 crore are adults.He further pointed out that the government has said that 29 crore people have received double doses, which is just 21 per cent of the entire population.“Only this 21 per cent is in the safe zone. Also, booster doses are not being given in the country as yet,” the Congress MP from Berhampore stated.India had started immunisation programmes way back in 1975 and country is called the “vaccine hub of the world”, he maintained.“The central government is trying to project its vaccination campaign in a way like it was the first-of-its-kind initiative undertaken in the country,” the Congress MP claimed.Chowdhury also took a dig at Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over her claim that the state is giving free vaccines to its people, “quite like what the Centre has also said”, and sought to know where money came from.The revenue is being generated by imposing taxes on petrol, diesel and LPG, he added.India achieved a milestone in its inoculation programme against COVID-19 as the cumulative vaccine doses administered surpassed the 100-crore mark on Thursday, resulting in celebratory events in parts of the country.The PM hailed the landmark reached in little over nine months time since the countrywide vaccination drive was launched on January 16 as a triumph of Indian science, enterprise and collective spirit of 130 crore.

Some courts function out of dilapidated buildings. Judicial infrastructure is important for improving access to justice," he said."It is baffling to note that the improvement and maintenance of judicial infrastructure is still being carried out in an ad-hoc and unplanned manner," CJI Ramana added.He further said that the building that was inaugurated at Aurangabad on Saturday was envisioned in 2011."That it has taken 10 years for this vision to be implemented is extremely worrisome. This is a deeper problem that has plagued the judicial infrastructure planning in our country since the Independence," the CJI said."An effective judiciary can aid in the effective growth of the economy," he said.The CJI said he had sent a proposal for the establishment of the National Judicial Infrastructural Authority to the Union Minister of Law and Justice, and added that he was hoping for a positive response.

The Assembly polls in Goa, which is currently ruled by the saffron party, are due in February next year."Goa can become 'swayampurna' (self-sufficient) only when it makes cent per cent use of the developmental avenues and possibilities," Modi said, adding that 'Swayampurna Goa' is a means to fulfilling the aspirations of common people."Swayampurna Goa is an assurance of well-being and health of our mothers and sisters. Swayampurna Goa will provide employment and self-employment opportunities to the youth and unemployed people," he added.Modi said that it is not just a programme of five months or five years, but it is a first phase of the vision for next 25 years.Each one from Goa would have to contribute to achieve the goal, he added."That is why, Goa needs continuation of development by the double engine government. Goa needs clear policies like the way they are today and a stable government," he said.

23-10-2021||Mumbai||Life expectancy in India dropped by two years due to Covid: Study||The coronavirus pandemic, which has affected the lives of people at different levels, has also caused a drop in the life expectancy of the country by almost two years, a statistical analysis by scientists of the city-based International Institute for Population Studies (IIPS) has revealed. The analytical report, which points out the drop in life expectancy at birth in both men and women due to the pandemic, has been published in the journal 'BMC Public Health' recently. IIPS professor Suryakant Yadav has authored the report."The life expectancy at birth in 2019 was 69.5 years for men and 72 years for women, which came down to 67.5 years and 69.8 years, respectively, in 2020," the report said.The life expectancy at birth is calculated on the basis of the average number of years a newborn is expected to live if mortality patterns at the time of the birth of the infant remain constant in future.The study undertaken by Prof Yadav also included a factor termed 'length of life inequality' and found that Covid has claimed maximum lives of men in the age group of 39-69."The 35-79 age group had excess deaths caused by Covid in 2020 as compared to normal years and it is this group that has contributed immensely to the drop," Yadav said.This study was conducted to look at the burden repercussions of the Covid on mortality patterns in the country.IIPS director Dr KS James said, "Every time we are affected with some epidemic, the life expectancy at birth figures dwindle. For instance, after the HIV-AIDS epidemic in African nations, the expectancy had dropped. Once it was brought under control, the life expectancy recouped as well."

Upcoming festivities will fuel this spirit Narendra Modi, Prime MinisterModi asked people to make mask-wearing a habit and hailed the 100 crore vaccine dose landmark as a “picture of new India which can set and achieve high targets and can tirelessly work to achieve its goals”. As he reflected on the challenges faced since the outbreak of the pandemic, the PM said one billion shots was an answer to cynics who questioned how a democratic country like India could vaccinate such a large population in time to beat the pandemic. “Administering 100 crore plus doses is not just a statistic.It is a reflection of the Indian capacity to script history and a matter of pride for every citizen,” said the PM, speaking of the government’s “free vaccine programme”. He said questions were raised from the start about Indian preparedness, considering the nation’s conventional dependence on the West for vaccines.Hailing the national Covid inoculation programme as science-born, science-driven and science-based, the PM said it was not allowed to be overwhelmed by VIP culture. “If the disease did not discriminate, why should the vaccination programme discriminate?” he asked, adding the feat would cement India’s place as the pharmacy of the world and was already spurring “all-round optimism”.“The world will see India as a safer destination now. There is new energy everywhere, the economy is looking up and the world is bullish on India. This is the time to buy local and make “vocal for local” a mass campaign like ‘Clean India’,” said the PM ahead of Diwali.In apparent jibes at the Opposition, he noted Indians made collective participation their first line of defence against Covid.“We clapped and clanged thalis, lit diyas to harness energies.

23-10-2021||Chandigarh||Army, IAF to re-enact 1947 landing of Indian troops that saved Srinagar from Pak raiders||As part of the ongoing commemorations of ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahaotsav’, the armed forces have planned a re-enactment of the 1947 landings of Indian troops at Srinagar that had saved the Valley from Pakistani raiders, along with some other associated events at Srinagar on October 27.It was 74 years ago on October 27 that the first wave of Indian troops were flown to Srinagar on Dakota transport aircraft. In the first phase of the operations, elements of the First Battalion of the Sikh Regiment landed at Srinagar airfield and secured the airfield and established a blocking position east of Baramulla. The day is since commemorated as Infantry Day each year.A Dakota aircraft that is believed to have participated in the landings is now back in the IAF’s fleet, having being painstakingly restored after being decommissioned years ago and then flown to India from the United Kingdom.The restored aircraft bears the Tail Number VP 905, the same as that of the first Dakota which had touched down at Srinagar in 1947. Now flying with the IAF’s Vintage Aircraft Flight based at Palam, it was part of the Air Force Day fly past over Hindon this year.“We are making efforts to secure the participation of the sole vintage Dakota with the IAF for the historic event,” a senior officer said.“If the Dakota is not available, the alternative would be to use AN-32,” he added.The US-origin Douglas C-47 Dakota, an iconic propeller driven aircraft that dates back to 1941, was extensively used by the Allied Forces during World War II and remained in service with military forces across the globe as well as civilian operators for many years.The first transport squadron of the erstwhile Royal Indian Air Force, No 12 Squadron, was raised in 1946 with 10 Dakota aircraft at Panagarh. This squadron, initially raised on Spitfire fighters at Kohat in 1945, is now based at Agra, flying the AN-32.The venerable Dakotas had served the IAF from 1946 to 1987, with over 200 such aircraft having been bought over a period of time. These saw extensive participation in all wars as well as the IAF’s pioneering missions in the Himalayas and the north-east.The aircraft, now back with the IAF was built in 1944, and besides serving with the British and Indian air forces, was also operated by various civil airlines. It was retrieved from scrap in 2011 and was restored to flying condition in the UK by Rajya Sabha Member Rajeev Chandrasekhar and presented to the IAF in February 2018.After being upgraded with a new navigation system, it winged its way to India from Coventry through France, Italy, Greece, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Oman and across the Arabian Sea before touchdown at Jamnagar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-iaf-to-re-enact-1947-landing-of-indian-troops-that-saved-srinagar-from-pak-raiders-328121

The cause was suspected to be a short circuit inside a flat but this was yet to be confirmed, officials said.Inquiry would be conducted into the incident, said Mumbai municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal who along with Mayor Kishori Pednekar visited the spot.The flames spread from the 19th floor to the 20th before being doused after five hours. As many as 16 fire engines, nine water tankers and two ladders were pressed into service, a fire brigade official said.“After the fire broke out, Arun Tiwari, a security guard of the building, rushed to the 19th floor. But he soon realized that he was trapped and to save himself he went to the balcony of the flat where the fire had erupted,” another official said.“He held on to the balcony’s railing, dangling precariously for several minutes before losing grip and falling to his death,” the official said.He was rushed to the civic-run KEM Hospital where he was declared dead.The fire brigade said it was a “level-4” fire, which means a major blaze.Mayor Pednekar said Tiwari could have been saved had the private security guards appointed at the building been well-trained.“They (Tiwari’s colleagues) had 15 minutes to take necessary steps. Had they caught him in a bedsheet below or put mattresses on the floor, he might have survived,” she said.He lost grip on the railing before the fire brigade could put up the ladder, she added.As many as 16 persons who were stuck on the upper floors were safely rescued through the staircase while two people, earlier said to be missing, were safe in their flat, officials said.Hemant Parab, chief fire official of the Mumbai Fire Brigade, told PTI that the fire was confined to only 19th and 20th floors.Initially, the internal fire-fighting system of the building did not have sufficient water pressure, but later it started working, he said. The fire could have been contained quicker had the system functioned well from the start, he added.Maharashtra Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray also visited the spot.“Fire has been doused and cooling ops are underway. I met and thanked the brave jawans of the Mumbai Fire Brigade for their swift response,” he tweeted.After five hours, around 5 pm, the fire brigade declared that the fire was completely doused.Pednekar called an immediate meeting of deputy municipal commissioners in the evening on the issues of fire safety and illegal constructions.Commissioner Chahal said strict action would be taken if the complaints made by the building’s residents were found to be true.“An administrative inquiry into the fire incident will be conducted. Also, if the complaints are found be factual, strict action will be taken against the concerned,” Chahal said.Pednekar said some furniture work was going on in the flat where the fire started. The building has 300 flats and around 200 of them are occupied, she said.Residents of the building alleged while speaking to the media that the developer had not yet transferred the premises formally to them though society was formed long ago, and therefore they can not carry out any work.Some residents also alleged that the builder was carrying out illegal construction on the premises.Pednekar said she had asked the administration to probe these allegations.

23-10-2021||Aditi Tandon||No matter how strong the shield, can’t lay weapons till Covid war is on, PM urges caution during festivities||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 22Describing the 100 crore plus Covid vaccine mark as a symbol of India’s collective strength, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday urged caution in the coming festive season, even as he asked people to buy made-in-India products riding high on what he described as “allround optimism yielded by the 100 crore plus Covid doses”.Also read: PM Modi misleading country on vaccinations: Congress“No matter how strong the protection and the shield, and how strong its guarantee, we can’t lay our weapons till the Covid war is on,” the PM said in his 20-minute address to the nation a day after India became the second country in the world after China to cross the one billion vaccine doses mark.The PM asked people to celebrate with precautions and make masks a habit, while congratulating them for the feat of one billion doses.“Just like we don’t move out of the house without our shoes we have to make masks a habit. The unvaccinated must use masks on priority,” the PM said.Devoting most of bis address to the 100 crore vaccine dose landmark and the challenges faced in reaching it, the PM said it was an answer to those who asked if a democratic country like India could vaccinate its people enough and in time to beat the pandemic.“The 100 crore plus vaccines is not just a statistic. It is a reflection of new India which can set and achieve mighty goals and an India which can work tireless to achieve its targets,” said the PM.He recalled how questions were raised about Indian preparedness when the pandemic broke out considering “India has always depended on the West for vaccines”.“When once-in-a-century pandemic came, questions were raised about us. Will India be able to fight Covid? How will it arrange money to buy vaccines? Will it even get vaccines? Can india inoculate enough people to stop the pandemic? All kinds of questions were asked. The 100 crore vaccine doses answer all those questions and show that Indian democracy is all about ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayas,” the PM said.He hailed the Indian vaccine programme as science-born, science-driven and science-based, adding, “VIP culture was not allowed to overwhelm the vaccine programme. No matter how rich anyone is they got the vaccine like anyone else.”Terming the achievement of the one billion vaccine goal as difficult and unprecedented, the PM said today there is “optimism across segments due to this feat and the world will see India as a safer place after this record vaccination”.He noted that there was new energy all over, the economy was looking up and the world was bullish on India and asked people to make ‘vocal for local’ a campaign, saying, “This Diwali, I urge you all to buy ‘made in India’. There was a time when made in other countries was a craze but today ‘made in India’ should become the practice.”Citing a Vedic reference, the PM said Indians discharged their duties during the pandemic and reaped outcomes.“When collective efforts are made, outcomes are unprecedented. We made collective participation our strength and our first line of defence. We clapped and clanged thalis. We lit diyas to harness our collective strength. Some people asked if this would defeat the disease but we saw in it our unity and power as a nation,” the PM said in apparent jibes at the Opposition.He said that Indians beat vaccine hesitancy to achieve this milestone at a time when many other nations were struggling with hesitancy.“We used innovative methods to accomplish the phenomenal task of reaching vaccines to remote areas,” said the PM, asking people to be cautious as upcoming festivities give more energy to “allround positive activities”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-matter-how-strong-the-shield-cant-lay-weapons-till-covid-war-is-on-pm-urges-caution-during-festivities-327956
