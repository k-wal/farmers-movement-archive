Ajay Mishra’s arrest and dismissal are awaited in addition to arrests of all culprits in Lakhimpur Kheri farmers’ massacre,” it added.Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son, who was arrested in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, was remanded to judicial custody for 14 days and placed under Covid quarantine in the district jail in Lakhimpur Kheri, officials said on Sunday.Four of the eight people who died in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence were farmers, allegedly knocked down by a vehicle carrying BJP workers. Angry farmers then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles.The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver.Farmers have claimed that Ashish Mishra was in one of the vehicles, an allegation denied by him and his father who say they can produce evidence to prove he was at an event at that time.The farmer unions had said if the government does not accept their demands by October 11, they will take out a ‘Shaheed Kisan Yatra’ from Lakhimpur Kheri with the ashes of the farmers who died.The SKM had also given a call for a ‘rail roko’ protest across the country from 10 am to 4 pm on October 18 and a ‘mahapanchayat’ in Lucknow on October 26.“Planning, meetings are happening in various states to implement SKM call for action for justice in Lakhimpur Kheri farmers massacre,” the SKM statement said on Sunday.The SKM pointed out that Ajay Mishra, continuing as a minister in the Modi government and that too for Home Affairs, is completely “untenable and inconceivable”.“It is clear that the MoS Home had a role to play in promoting enmity and disharmony, in criminal conspiracy and murder, as well as in harbouring offenders and trying to obstruct justice and to tamper with/conceal evidence,” the statement said.

Nowhere in the world would the police invite a murder accused for interrogation, she said.Priyanka said people should compel those in power to give justice.“The Congress workers do not fear anyone even if you put them in jails or beat them. We will continue to fight till the Union MoS (Ajay Mishra) resigns. Our party has fought for the country’s Independence and no one can silence us,” she said.She also said families of aggrieved people in the state, be it from Sonbhadra (where 13 tribals were killed), Hathras or even Lakhimpur Kheri, said they do not want compensation but justice, of which they have no hope.“Time has come and I am not talking about the elections, I am talking about the country. The country is not the fiefdom of BJP office-bearers, their ministers or the prime minister. This is your country. If you do not become aware and remain entangled in their politics, then neither will you be able to save yourself nor the country,” she said.About the farmers’ protest, she said, “Farmers are protesting against farm laws for the past 10 months and 600 of them have lost their lives. They are protesting because their farm, income and produce will go to the billionaire friends of Modiji through the provisions of these (central) laws.” “The billionaire friends of Modiji purchased apples last year at Rs 88 per kg in Himachal Pradesh and this year, it was purchased at Rs 72 per kg. everybody is compelled to sell apples at lower price. This situation will prevail in the country when the laws are implemented,” she claimed.The PM who calls himself a ‘Gangaputra’—son of the Ganga—has insulted crores of “Gangaputras” by hatching a conspiracy to give their crops and income to his billionaire friends, Priyanka alleged.Priyanka said when she speaks to people, they tell her that there are no jobs and income.People may belong to any caste and religion, they are not safe, the Congress leader alleged.“In this country, the prime minister, his council of ministers, people from his party and their billionaire friends are safe. Understand this properly. The country is getting destroyed,” the Congress leader said.Before the rally, Priyanka visited the Kashi Vishwanath and Kushmanda temples.Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel also offered prayers at the Kashi Vishwanath temple.The rally started with the recitation of “mantras”, Gurbani and verses from the Quran. After Priyanka reached the rally venue, the Congress leaders present on the stage raised the religious slogan of “Har Har Mahadev”.At the beginning of her speech, Priyanka recited “Sanskrit shlokas” and chanted “Jai Mata Di”.Senior UP Congress leader Pradeep Mathur told PTI that Congress workers from different walks of life accorded a warm welcome to the party general secretary.State Congress spokesperson Ashok Singh said with Sunday’s event, the party has launched itself aggressively for the upcoming 2022 UP Assembly elections.“The Congress under the leadership of Priyankaji will comprehensively defeat the demon power, which has unleashed itself in various parts of the state,” Singh said.

10-10-2021||Bengaluru||‘Modern Indian women want to stay single; unwilling to give birth even after marriage’: Karnataka minister||Karnataka Health Minister Dr K Sudhakar on Sunday claimed that modern Indian women want to stay single, unwilling to give birth even after marriage and desire children by surrogacy.“Today, I am sorry to say this, lots of modern women in India want to stay single. Even if they get married, they don’t want to give birth. They want surrogacy. So there is a paradigm shift in our thinking, which is not good,” he said during the World Mental Health Day at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurological Sciences (NIMHANS).Lamenting the “western influence” on Indian society, the Minister said people are not willing to let their parents be with them.“Unfortunately, today we are going in a western way. We don’t want our parents to live with us, forget about grandparents being with us,” the minister said.Speaking about mental health in India, Sudhakar said every seventh Indian has some kind of mental issue, which could be mild, moderate and severe.However, according to him, stress management is an art and Indian need not have to learn but preach the world how to handle it.“Stress management is an art. This art we need not learn as Indians. We need to preach to the world how to handle stress, because yoga, meditation and Pranayama are the wonderful tools which our ancestors had taught the world thousands of years back,” he said.About Covid-19 and mental health, Sudhakar said the relatives were not able to touch the bodies of their near and dear ones, which caused them mental agony.“The pandemic made the government start counselling Covid-19 patients. Till date we have counseled 24 lakh Covid-19 patients in Karnataka. I don’t know any other state which has done this,” Sudhakar said.Expressing his gratitude to the NIMHANS, he said the institute was counseling people from its digital platform and was offering tele-medicine.Sudhakar also expressed his gratitude to Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, who spoke earlier at the event, for giving 1.5 crore COVID-19 vaccines to Karnataka every month since September, which increased the inoculation coverage in the state.He hailed the union government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for giving 94 crore vaccines till date since the launch of vaccination drive as the country undertook the Herculean task of vaccinating the entire population free of cost.“We are the only country which is offering vaccines free of cost. Elsewhere, people are made to pay between Rs 1,500 to Rs 4,000 per vaccine,” Sudhakar said.

10-10-2021||Naveen S Garewal||Andhra seeks PM Modi’s intervention on energy crisis||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, October 10Andhra Pradesh is heading for an energy crisis with coal shortage and bad fiscal health of the power distribution companies. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has sought the immediate intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi given the alarming situation.In a letter to the prime minister, Jagan has voiced his concern and sought immediate remedial measures. The letter reads, “It has become increasingly difficult for the state to meet the energy demand and the situation was pushing it towards load shedding.”He stated that given the state’s precarious financial situation, it was not able to purchase the required power from the open market as the purchase prices have also shot up with growing demand.The state has requested Coal Ministry through the prime minister for the allotment of 20 coal rakes to thermal power stations in Andhra Pradesh. The chief minister also sought a revival of stranded and non-working pit head coal plants on an emergency basis regardless of the ongoing proceedings before the National Companies Law Tribunal.This letter reads will save the coal transport time and quantity limitations in coal transportation to non-pit head coal plants.“The deficit of nearly 500 MW from central generating stations due to plant maintenance can be bridged by reviving the plants at the earliest or the maintenance be postponed,” the chief minister wrote.Chief Minister has told the PM that in the post-Covid era power demand in Andhra Pradesh increased by 15 per cent in the last six months and by 20 per cent in the last month. This coupled with the coal shortage is pushing the energy sector into turmoil, he said.He also urged PM Modi to direct banks/lending institutions to provide working capital loans liberally to distribution companies till the crisis is tided over in order to make coal payments and undertake market purchases.Andhra Pradesh is currently meeting power demand of about 185-190 million units per day.The chief minister also said in his letter that more water was required in the current last stage of harvesting. If the power supply was to be denied, the fields would dry up causing yet another crisis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-seeks-pm-modis-intervention-on-energy-crisis-322769
10-10-2021||Mumbai||Cruise drugs case: NCB arrests Nigerian national; 20 people held so far||The Narcotics Control Bureau arrested a Nigerian national on Sunday in connection with the cruise drugs party raid case, an NCB official said.With this, 20 people have so far been arrested by the NCB in connection with the case, including Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan, he said.Giving details of the latest arrest, the official said a team of the NCB laid a trap in suburban Goregaon and apprehended the accused, identified as Okaro Ouzama, “along with an intermediate quantity of cocaine” on Saturday.This is the second arrest of a foreign national in the case, the official said.Earlier also, the NCB had arrested a Nigerian in the case.The NCB is making effort to explore the foreign linkages in the case on the basis of interrogation of the all accused persons, the official said.He also said that two men, whom NCP leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik had claimed as “outsiders” involved in the raid, were actually among the nine independent witnesses involved in the whole operation.He said the duo was not known to the NCB before October 2, when the raid was conducted on the Goa-bound ship.A total of nine independent witnesses were involved in the whole operation (cruise ship raid) and Manish Bhanushali and K P Gosavi were among them. “None of the independent witnesses, including the two (Bhanushali and Gosavi) were known to the NCB before October 2,” the official said.The NCB had earlier said all the allegations levelled against it in connection with the cruise ship raid were “baseless, motivated afterthoughts and prejudicial”.NCB’s Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede had said the anti-drugs agency works professionally. “We do not see any political party and religion. We do our job professionally,” he added.Based on a tip-off, an NCB team raided the Goa-bound cruise ship on October 2 and claimed to have recovered banned drugs.The case took a political turn when NCP leader Nawab Malik on Wednesday claimed that the raid was “fake” and that “outsiders” were involved in it.On Saturday, Malik alleged that the NCB had initially detained 11 people from the Goa-bound cruise ship, but let off three of them, including the brother-in-law of a BJP leader, a couple of hours later.

10-10-2021||Ahmedabad||Man held for abandoning toddler son in Gujarat; was fleeing after killing live-in partner||A man who was held from Kota in Rajasthan for abandoning his toddler son in Gandhinagar in Gujarat had allegedly murdered the infant’s mother before fleeing the state, a police official said on Sunday.The 10-month-old child was found abandoned late Friday night outside a cowshed in Gandhinagar’s Pethapur village, and 14 police teams soon zeroed in on his father, Sachin Dikshit, after checking CCTV footage of the vicinity and he was held on Saturday and brought here this morning, police said.“Dikshit was married but had a live-in relation with the victim, identified as Menhndi alias Heena Pathani, with whom he had the boy. He first strangled Heena in a Vadodara flat, then abandoned baby Shivansh near the cowshed and fled,” Abhay Chudasama, Inspector General of Police (Gandhinagar Range) told reporters.“The body of the toddler’s mother was found packed in a bag in the kitchen of their flat in Vadodara on Sunday. Dikshit used to live five days a week with Heena in Vadodara, where he worked, and spent the weekends in his Gandhinagar flat with wife and parents,” the IG said.He met Heena in 2019 when she was working in a showroom in Ahmedabad, and then after a brief separation, reunited and started living in with her after he got a job in Vadodara, with Shivansh being born in 2020, he added.Two days ago, the couple had a fight after Dikshit said he was going to his native Uttar Pradesh to live with his parents and wife, the official said.“An argument broke out and he strangled Heena and then packed the body in a bag, leaving it in the kitchen, possibly as he could not muster courage to dispose it off. He abandoned the baby near a cowshed from where he frequently bought milk,” he said.The IG said Dikshit later left for Uttar Pradesh via Rajasthan with his parents and wife but was nabbed by police en route at Kota after CCTV cameras caught him coming out of his car and abandoning the child near the cowshed.“The baby is in an orphanage and his DNA samples will be matched with the accused. Dikshit, who was arrested on charges of abandoning the baby, will be booked for murder as well. Primarily, it appears the accused’s wife did not know anything about his live-in status with Heena,” said Chudasama. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-held-for-abandoning-toddler-son-in-gujarat-was-fleeing-after-killing-live-in-partner-322766

10-10-2021||New Delhi||Centre allows export of Russian Covid vaccine Sputnik Light manufactured by Indian drug firm||The government has permitted the export of Russia’s single-dose Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik Light domestically produced here as the jab has not yet been approved for emergency use in India, sources said on Sunday.Indian drug firm Hetero Biopharma Limited has been allowed to export 40 lakh doses of Sputnik Light to Russia, sources in the know of the developments told PTI.Sputnik Light is the same as component-1 of the Russian vaccine Sputnik V which is being used in India’s anti-Covid inoculation programme after getting emergency use authorisation from India’s Drug Regulator in April.The Russian ambassador had urged the Indian government to allow the export of Sputnik Light produced by Hetero Biopharma, one of the partners of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) in the production of the jab, to his country till the vaccine gets emergency use authorisation from India’s drug regulator.In a communication to the Centre, Russian Ambassador Nicholay Kudashev had stated that Hetero Biopharma Limited already has manufactured one million doses of Component 1 of the Sputnik V and two million doses of the Sputnik Light but the six-month shelf life of the vaccine may expire before its registration which will result in the wastage of vaccine doses, sources said.“The government has permitted Indian drug firm Hetero Biopharma to export 40 lakh doses of Sputnik Light to Russia. The decision was taken this week following detailed deliberations,” a source said.Over the past months, the RDIF has been working closely with Indian pharmaceutical companies to ramp up the production of Sputnik vaccine in India that could be used in the local and global markets, the ambassador had stated in his communication last month.At the moment RDIF together with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is working with authorities concerned on the registration of the Sputnik Light in India.“We would like to note that Indian manufacturers of the Russian vaccine are discouraged by the current ban that prevents the use of the produced Sputnik Light vaccine in India and its export to other countries,” stated the communication from the ambassador to V K Paul, chair of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC).If permanent or time-to-time permission could be granted to Hetero Biophar Limited to export the produced Sputnik Light vaccine by selling it to RDIF until its registration in India, this could encourage the company to scale up the production of the vaccine and provide the Indian market with more supplies of the Sputnik Light by the moment of its regulatory approval, it said.The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) had in September given permission to Dr Reddy’s Laboratory Limited to conduct phase-3 bridging trials of Sputnik Light in India.The DCGI’s permission was based on the recommendations by the Subject Expert Committee on COVID-19 of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation(CDSCO), which held its meeting on August 5.According to the recommendations of the SEC meeting held last month, Dr Reddy’s, which has tied up with the RDIF to market the jab in India, presented updated safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data of Phase III clinical trial of Sputnik Light vaccine conducted in Russia, along with the proposal to conduct the clinical trial in India.“After detailed deliberation, the committee recommended for grant of permission for conduct of Phase III immune-bridging clinical trial in Indian population subject to the condition...”, the SEC recommendation had said.The Committee noted that the firm has now presented the safety and immunogenicity along with the longevity of the antibodies, which gives a measure of the persistence of antibodies in the participants.In July, the subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation had refused to grant emergency-use authorisation for Sputnik Light.The single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine demonstrated 79.4 percent efficacy according to analysed data taken from 28 days after the injection was administered as part of Russia’s mass vaccination program between December 5, 2020 and April 15, 2021.An efficacy level of almost 80 percent is higher than that of many two-dose vaccines.Sputnik Light has proven effective against all new strains of coronavirus, as demonstrated by the Gamaleya Center during laboratory tests, a press release from RDIF had said on May 6.

10-10-2021||New Delhi||Gravity of offence be looked into by court while granting anticipatory bail: SC||The gravity of an offence and specific allegations are the parameters that should be looked into by a court while granting anticipatory bail to an accused, the Supreme Court has said.A bench of justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna made the observations while setting aside an order passed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court granting anticipatory bail to two persons accused in a murder case.The top court said it has to determine whether, on the basis of the material available at this stage, the high court applied the correct principles in allowing the applications for anticipatory bail.“Courts ought to be generally guided by considerations such as the nature and gravity of the offences, the role attributed to the applicant, and the facts of the case, while considering whether to grant anticipatory bail, or refuse it,” the bench said.The top court was hearing appeals challenging anticipatory bail granted to two accused in connection with an offence registered under Sections 302 (murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) read with 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.The apex court said the offence is of a serious nature in which a person was murdered and the FIR and the statements indicate a specific role of the accused in the crime.“The order granting anticipatory bail has ignored material aspects, including the nature and gravity of the offence, and the specific allegations against the accused. Hence, a sufficient case has been made out for cancelling the anticipatory bail granted by the high court,” the bench said.The apex court said that facts need not be examined in detail at the present stage and it would examine whether the high court had correct principles for the grant of anticipatory bail.“The material at this stage cannot be examined with a fine-tooth comb in the manner of a criminal trial. What needs to be determined is whether the parameters for the grant of anticipatory bail were correctly formulated and applied by the single judge,” the bench said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gravity-of-offence-be-looked-into-by-court-while-granting-anticipatory-bail-sc-322737

His team said he had produced around 150 images of the wrestling match where he was present on the day of the incident."To every question, he had one answer -- I was not present at the spot where the incident took place. We asked him who drove his SUV, how many people were sitting in it, how many cars were there in the convoy and for every question he said he was not present," said the police officer.When asked why the vehicle did not stop after hitting the people and why there was a crowd on the road, Ashish Mishra had one reply -- I was not there.At times, he even lost his cool and said, "Even if you ask me one lakh times, my answer will be the same." He even feigned complete ignorance about the fact that his men carried arms with them.The families of at least two deceased have claimed that there were gunshot wounds on the bodies -- fact denied in the postmortem report.However, two empty cartridges of 315. bore rifle have been found at the site of the incident, proving that someone opened fire.When the police team asked him the veracity of video footage, he had produced to substantiate his presence at the wrestling match earlier in the district, Ashish said, "You can get it tested from forensic experts." He still had no explanation for his whereabouts at the time when the incident took place because the wrestling match had ended by then.When asked why he was not cooperating with the investigations, Ashish said, "Whenever I am needed, I will come. I am not a criminal-- I am the son of a politician and a businessman in my own right."Mishra was arrested a day after the Supreme Court reminded the Uttar Pradesh Government that the law must take its course against “whoever is involved” amid nationwide outrage over the incident and mounting pressure from farmer groups.Two persons,  Luv Kush and Ashish Pandey, were arrested on Thursday as the case reached the Supreme Court. They were reportedly in the same vehicle that ran over a journalist and farmers, the police said.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had earlier stated that his government will “not arrest anyone on the basis of allegations”. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-union-minister-ajay-mishras-son-ashish-evades-crucial-questions-322701

Here is an exchange that followed between JRD and Indira Gandhi, who was then out of power.” On February 1, 1978, the then Morarji Desai government had removed JRD Tata from the boards of Air India and Indian Airlines.

But he did not return as chairman.You Raised Air India to int’l levelYou (JRD Tata) were not merely chairman, but the founder and nurturer who felt deep personal concern… The meticulous care you gave to the smallest detail, including the decor and the saris of the hostesses, raised Air India to the international level. —Indira Gandhi, Former PMIn a handwritten letter, Indira had expressed concern for the government’s decision and lauded Tata’s efforts in building the airlines. “You were not merely chairman, but the founder and nurturer who felt deep personal concern,” she had written, addressing JRD Tata as “Dear Jeh”.“There was some misunderstanding between us, but it was not possible for me to let you know of the pressures under which I had to function and the rivalries within the Ministry of Civil Aviation,” she wrote.Ramesh also shared JRD’s response. “I was touched by your kind reference to the part I played in building up the airline. I was fortunate in the loyalty and enthusiasm of my colleagues and the support I got from the government,” JRD had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/when-indira-gandhi-lauded-dear-jeh-for-building-air-india-322502

If they are there to stay at the LAC, we won’t retract too. We have matched the infrastructure on our side,” the Army Chief said at a function organised by a media house.J&K killings a desperate moveTargeting civilians in Kashmir shows the psyche of the terrorists and looks like their last-ditch effort to remain relevant… Spurt in activities in Kashmir cannot be directly linked to events in Afghanistan. —General MM Naravane, Army chiefAsked if the LAC could turn into a Line of Control (LoC)-type deployment, the General said, “We will be in LoC-kind of a situation, but not as active as the LoC.”The LoC is the 749-km divide between India and Pakistan where troops are at eyeball-to-eyeball contact.Talking about the trigger to the ensuing military stand-off in eastern Ladakh, the Army Chief said the Ministry of External Affairs had made it very clear.On October 7, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said, “This (tension along the LAC) started with China’s unilateral move that disturbed peace and tranquillity. We made counter deployments to counter China.”On being asked to judge what could the adversary be thinking, the General said, “This is a question to understand why the Chinese have done this (at LAC) when the world was reeling under a pandemic and they had their own issues on their eastern sea board (with US over Taiwan).” China had not achieved anything because of the rapid response of the Indian Army, he said.The nature of warfare was changing and technology was going to play a very important part in war, he said. “Future could have more over the horizon strikes rather than physical engagement… in case of India, the unsettled borders mean we cannot do away with ‘boots on the ground’ as we embrace technology,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/massive-infrastructure-build-up-by-china-along-lac-army-chief-322506

Just as Ashish appeared before the Uttar Pradesh SIT, his father and Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra reached his Lakhimpur Kheri office. Within minutes, hundreds of BJP workers from the parliamentary segment which Ajay Mishra represents, began arriving at his office in a show of solidarity with Ashish.A section of the Union Minister’s supporters raised slogans in favour of his son, claiming a “conspiracy against Ashish” who, they said, was preparing to contest the UP elections from Nighasan in the Kheri Lok Sabha segment. They also claimed that Ashish was not present at the site of the deaths — Tikonia-Banbirpur road — on October 3, the day three SUVs allegedly mowed down protesting farmers.The FIR against Ashish Mishra, however, charges him with grave offences, including murder and firing. It says he was on the left seat of Thar Mahindra, the first in the convoy of three vehicles to hit a group of farmers returning from a protest site, and had escaped after firing shots into the air. The vehicle was later torched by angry protesters.“We now look forward to the sacking of Ajay Mishra,” said Satnam Singh, father of deceased farmer Lovpreet Singh. Pawan Kashyap, the brother of deceased Raman Kashyap, demanded an impartial probe. In Lakhimpur Kheri town, where the Police Lines, Ajay Mishra’s office and the local court are located within a radius of 1 km, there was palpable tension due to the presence of the minister’s supporters. “Only the powerful have their way here. Let’s see what happens,” observed a local shopkeeper.Ashish’s arrival at the Police Lines today didn’t come easy. The police had to paste summons at the local residence of the family’s native village Banbirpur. The October 12 memorial service also mounted pressure on state police to act fast.Sidhu ends fastChandigarh: PPCC president Navjot Sidhu ended his fast after Ashish Mishra appeared before the police. “The Almighty gave me the strength to fight for a just cause … Path of truth will always triumph,” he tweeted.

Announcing their strategy, Yadav said, “Effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah will be set on fire on Dasehra.”The plan includes an ‘antim ardas’ on October 12 to pay tribute to farmers killed at Tikonia, a countrywide ‘rail roko’ agitation on October 18 and a ‘mahapanchayat’ in Lucknow on October 26. BKU leader Rakesh Tikait criticised the PM over his silence whereas many Opposition leaders had met and consoled the victims’ families.Regarding allegations against him for “striking a deal”, Tikait said, “Bodies were lying without last rites… How long that could continue? Our settlement will only come when Ajay Mishra and his son are arrested.”Tikait said he did not consider those who killed BJP workers at Lakhimpur as culprits as they only reacted to SUV running over protesters. “The killing of two BJP workers after a convoy of cars mowed down four farmers was a reaction to an action,” Tikait said.Joginder Singh, president of the BKU (U), said the stir was peaceful, but the BJP governments were trying to discredit it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dismiss-union-minister-ajay-mishra-samyukt-kisan-morcha-322494

Two units were shut at Talwandi Sabo Power Plant, Mansa, while one at Guru Hargobind Thermal Plant, Lehra Mohabbat. Two units at Guru Gobind Singh Super Thermal Plant, Ropar, were shut because of technical glitches.Though one unit of Talwandi Sabo plant was made operational later in the afternoon, there was still a gap in demand and supply. Punjab today faced a shortage of 1,000 MW of electricity from its own generation capacity. Consumers faced cuts ranging from one to three hours in cities, while cuts of six to seven hours were imposed in rural areas. After the state bid at extremely high rates to buy power on the Power Exchange, it managed to get 284.3 lakh units of power for Rs 11.60 per KWh.Sources in the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) said the only saviour today was the low demand in the farm sector due to harvesting. As a result, the demand is around 8,500 MW, as compared to an average demand of 12,500 MW during the paddy season.A Venu Prasad, chairman and managing director, PSPCL, said the matter was taken up with the Government of India at the highest level, including by Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, requesting for additional coal linkage to the state’s thermal plants. “We have been assured of a regular supply of eight rakes of coal daily.

AICC general secretary KC Venugopal tweeted that the CWC would meet “to discuss the current political situation, forthcoming Assembly elections and organisational elections.”The meeting has been convened following demands from some quarters within the party to discuss important issues, including some recent defections. Former Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad had written to the Congress president to convene a CWC meeting at the earliest.Sources say the highest executive body of the party is expected to focus on farmers’ issues and may address questions related to the turmoil within party units, including the Punjab unit, and concerns raised by “G-23” leaders. The CWC meeting held on January 22 had decided that the Congress would have an elected president by June 2021, but the same was deferred at the May 10 meeting because of the Covid-19 situation. The latest meeting is being held in the wake of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight persons lost their lives, four of them farmers, who were allegedly run over by an SUV in MoS Ajay Kumar Mishra’s convoy.The incident has given enough ammunition to the Congress to corner the BJP government.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi should dismiss Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra within 24 hours, if he is serious about saving democracy,” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said. Party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had visited the kin of deceased farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cwc-meets-on-oct-16-internal-polls-on-agenda-322500
10-10-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand planning to enact UP-like stringent anti-conversion law||The Uttarakhand government is contemplating making the state’s anti-conversion law more stringent, providing for jail terms up to ten years and has sought a proposal to this effect from the state police chief.The Pushkar Singh Dhami government has sought the proposal citing “worsening of communal amity” amid “demographic changes” in some regions of the state.Uttarakhand Director General of Police Ashok Kumar on Saturday said Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami recently asked the Police Department to put up a proposal for enacting a more stringent anti-conversion law.Accordingly, the Police Department has forwarded a two-page proposal to the government to amend the state’s anti-conversion law on the line of that for Uttar Pradesh.He said the police have recommended making acts of “forcible religious conversion” a cognisable offence with a sentence of a minimum three-year jail term to the maximum of 10 years along with a fine of Rs 25,000.He said the state’s current law on the issue makes the forcible conversion a non-cognisable offence requiring the complaint to file a complaint in a court seeking its directions to the police to register an FIR.But the state’s new proposal seeks to make the forced religious conversion a cognisable offence, authorising police to lodge an FIR on its own without waiting for any court direction.Additional Chief Secretary Abhinav Kumar of Chief Minister Dhami said that the police proposal is being examined currently.The government’s decision to tighten the anti-conversion law comes in the wake of an attack by miscreants at a church in Roorkee of Haridwar district for allegedly promoting mass conversion.Last month, the state government had asked police to act against the consistent migration by the people of a particular community amid the rising population of another community in a particular region of the state.In this context, the state government had asked the police to identify the affected districts and act against the anti-social elements living there.Police have also been asked to prepare a list of anti-social elements with criminal antecedents who have settled in those affected districts of the state after migrating from outside.The police have been asked to prepare a record of such people after verifying their native places.The districts magistrates of these regions too have been asked to keep a tab on illegal sale purchase of land in their areas and ensure that no land transaction takes place under duress. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uttarakhand-planning-to-enact-up-like-stringent-anti-conversion-law-322402

10-10-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Why does this Karnataka man call the jungle his home? Read to know||For 17 years, Chandrashekhar has called a forest in Dakshina Kannada his home. He lives in his ambassador car, bathes in the river, makes a living out of weaving baskets from things lying around in the forest, and socialises with animals.  He could be the Indian version of Tom Hanks from the 2000 movie 'Cast Away'. He looks the part too, with his long flowing beard and his gaunt, weather-worn face. The 56-year-old Chandrashekhar moved into the forest between Adtale and Nekkare in Dakshina Kannada’s Sullia Taluk when hard times hit him: after a cooperative bank took away his home and his 1.5-acre land because he couldn’t repay a loan of Rs 40,000, he moved in with his sister and his family in Adtale but that got rough, forcing him to set off in his car— the one possession he still owned, News 18 said in its report.And 17 years later, he’s still there—a tarpaulin covering his car home, and a working radio that he uses to keep in touch with the world outside the forest.His contact with the outside world is limited to the radio and his visits to a shop in Adtale village, where he sells his baskets in exchange for rice, sugar, and other groceries, the report said.Wild elephants take a peek into his house every once in a while, as do wild boars, antelopes, leopards, and bison. Snakes are almost always around, but it doesn’t disturb him, the report said.Things became hard however when the pandemic struck, News 18’s report said. In the few months that everyone in the country withdrew into the homes to fight the pandemic, Chandrashekhar was forced to survive on water and other fluids to survive, but things began looking up again once the lockdown lifted, the news report said.  And what about authorities? They’ve largely kept away and left him alone, he says. The last time he met any authorities was when he was given the Covid-19 vaccine.  He claims he’s never harmed or looted resources from the forest and even uses only dead creepers for his baskets and so the forest department leaves him alone. “I don’t even cut bamboos in the forest. If I cut even a small shrub, I will lose the faith that forest department has on me," News 18 quoted him as saying.He was offered a real home once—a real house to live in—when District Collector AB Ibrahim visited him a few years ago, but Chandrashekhar refused, because that house was in the middle of a rubber forest.He dreams of getting back his real home—his farmland, but fears that his forest abode, his ambassador, might not make that journey.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-does-this-karnataka-man-call-the-jungle-his-home-read-to-know-322367

Both are in Eastern Ladakh that shares an 832-km undefined LAC on the ground with both sides making claims and counterclaims.The talks are slated to commence at 10:30 am at the Moldo Garrison of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), China. Moldo, located at the western edge of the Spanngur Tso (lake), faces the Indian garrison at Chushul in Eastern Ladakh.A partial success has been achieved at the last meeting , with India and China pulling back troops from the Patrolling Point (PP) 17-A, also referred to as Gogra.The disengagement from Gogra was undertaken as per the agreement arrived at the 12th round of India-China Corps Commander-level talks.“All temporary structures and other allied infrastructure created in the area (along the LAC) by both sides have been dismantled and mutually verified,” said the MoD. The landform in the area has been restored by both sides to the pre-standoff period, a statement of the Ministry of Defence had said after dis-engagement  at GograCurrently, the troops are not face to face, but are within striking range. There has been no faceoff since February.India wants that troops in close proximity should ‘disengage’ first, the next steps of de-escalation and de-induction of troops can happen in a graded fashion.A military stand-off between the two sides started in April 2020 and since February 2021, there has been graded improvement along the LAC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-stand-off-india-china-to-hold-13th-round-of-military-level-talks-on-sunday-322362
10-10-2021||Mumbai||NCP leader Nawab Malik names BJP leader whose kin was ‘let off’ by NCB hours after detention in cruise drugs case||NCP leader Nawab Malik on Saturday claimed that the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) had initially detained 11 people from a Goa-bound cruise ship off Mumbai coast last week, but let off three of them, including the brother-in-law of BJP leader Mohit Bharatiya, a couple of hours later.Addressing a press conference here, Malik, who is NCP's spokesperson and a Maharashtra minister, alleged that Bharatiya's brother-in-law Rishabh Sachdeva was among the three persons.Two others - Pratik Gabba and Aamir Furniturewala - who had brought Aryan Khan, son of actor Shah Rukh Khan, to the cruise party, were released along with Sachdeva two hours after their detention, he said.When contacted, Bharatiya declined to comment on the NCP's allegation, but his office said he would hold a press conference later in the day."The names of Pratik and Aamir figured in the ongoing hearings in the court," Malik said.Malik had earlier announced that on Saturday he would reveal the name of the BJP leader whose brother-in-law, he claimed, was let off by the anti-drug agency.Based on a tip-off that a party was to take place on board the ship, an NCB team led by its zonal director Sameer Wankhede had raided the Cordelia cruise last Saturday and claimed to have recovered banned drugs. A total of 18 people have been arrested in the case, including Aryan Khan.The NCP leader demanded that the call records of these three persons along with that of Wankhede be examined."Rishabh Sachdeva's father and uncle came to the NCB office and telephonic conversations happened between Wankhede and the BJP leaders in Mumbai and Delhi from the phone of Sachdeva's father," Malik claimed."Why were the phones of these three persons not seized?" he asked.According to Malik, the Mumbai police were also given information that 11 people had been detained from the cruise ship.Malik alleged that the NCB's raid on the cruise was "fake, planned and conspired to defame the film industry and the Maharashtra government"."Selective people have been arrested...The matter is serious. CCTV footage should be taken and a detailed inquiry conducted," the minority affairs minister alleged.He also hit out at the BJP for attacking him over his allegations."The BJP says that I am attacking the NCB since my son-in-law was arrested by the agency. I have never supported my son-in-law and he will fight his case. How can I give information I have in this case to the NCB which has framed a false case? If an independent commission is set up to conduct a probe, I will do so," Malik said.His son-in-law Sameer Khan had been arrested by the NCB on January 13 this year in an alleged drugs case. He had got bail in September. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncp-leader-nawab-malik-names-bjp-leader-whose-kin-was-let-off-by-ncb-hours-after-detention-in-cruise-drugs-case-322350

This is a sign of far-reaching thinking and respect for the environment by both our countries," he said.The green partnership, finalised at a virtual summit between the prime ministers of the two countries, aims to create a framework for significant expansion of cooperation in areas of renewable energy, environment, economy, climate change and science and technology.Describing the talks as "fruitful", Modi said both sides decided to cooperate in areas like efficient supply chain, smart water resources management and technologies relating to the farm sector to increase agricultural productivity in India.In her remarks, Frederiksen said the cooperation between India and Denmark is a great example of how green growth and green transition go hand-in-hand.She said both sides decided to boost cooperation, particularly in the health and agriculture sectors.Frederiksen arrived here early on Saturday morning on a three-day state visit.Earlier in the day, Modi welcomed Frederiksen to India at a ceremony in the Rashtrapati Bhavan.The Danish prime minister also visited Rajghat and paid tribute to Mahatma Gandhi.Ahead of the talks between the two prime ministers, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar called on Frederiksen."Welcomed Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on her first visit to India.

10-10-2021||New Delhi||Day before talks, Army chief says infrastructure shows PLA is 'here to stay' at LAC||Indicating that the militaries of India and China have “dug in their heels” along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Indian Army Chief General MM Naravane on Saturday said the infrastructure build-up by China along its side of the LAC seems they are “here to stay”.“We are keeping a close watch on development. If they are there to stay at the LAC we are there to stay too. We have matched the infrastructure on our side,” said the Army Chief.   The built-up by the Chinese shows they are at the LAC for a second winter—the first one being last year.The Army Chief was speaking at a function organised by media house,  India Today, and his remarks come a day ahead of the scheduled 13th round of talks between senior military commanders of either side.On being asked if the LAC could turn into a Line of Control (LoC) type deployment, the General said “ We will be in LoC-kind of a situation but not as active as the LoC.”  The LoC is the 749 km divide between India and Pakistan. Troops are eyeball-to-eyeball.Talking about the trigger to the ensuing military stand-off in Eastern Ladakh, the Army Chief said the Ministry of External Affairs has made it very clear. On October 7, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said “this (tension along the LAC) started with China’s unilateral move that disturbed peace and tranquility. We made counter deployments to counter China”.On being asked to judge what could the adversary be thinking, the General said  “This is a question to understand why the Chinese  have done this ( at LAC) when the world was reeling under a pandemic and they had their own issues on their eastern seaboard (with US over Taiwan).” China has not achieved anything because of the rapid response of the Indian Army, he added.  The nature of warfare is changing and technology is going to play a very important part in war. “Future could have more over the horizon strikes rather than physical engagement,” he said adding in the case of India unsettled borders means we cannot do away with ‘boots on the ground’ as we embrace technology. After the LAC stand off the Army is now focused on intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/day-before-talks-army-chief-says-infrastructure-shows-pla-is-here-to-stay-at-lac-322321
