02-10-2021||New Delhi||‘Farmers’ victory’: Congress on Centre’s order to procure paddy in Punjab, Haryana from Oct 3||The Congress on Saturday hailed as “farmers’ victory” the Centre’s order to commence paddy procurement in Punjab and Haryana from October 3 instead of October 11.The Centre’s earlier decision to postpone procurement till October 11 due to recent heavy rains sparked protests by farmers in the two states.  Responding to the development, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “The Modi government had to take back its arrogant decision to put off procurement till October 11.” “Yesterday Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit (Singh) Channi had raised this demand with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This is a tremendous victory for the farmers,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.The government will also have to take back the three farm laws, he said.In another tweet in Hindi, Surjewala said, “Now our demands are :- Every grain lying in the ‘Mandis’ should be procured and payment made, guidelines for procurement 2021-22 be issued, in view of unseasonal rains and delay in procurement, the moisture content of the crop should be relaxed up to 25 per cent, compensation for the damage of crop be given within seven days.”Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar met Union Consumer Affairs Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey on the issue on Saturday in Delhi. “I am happy that the Union Consumer Affairs Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey has accepted our request, and procurement will start in Haryana from October 3,” Khattar, who was flanked by his deputy Dushyant Chautala and Agriculture Minister J P Dalal said after the meeting.Chief Minister Channi, who had taken up the issue during his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, said that farmers will be satisfied with the decision as it will ensure smooth and hassle-free procurement.The procurement of Kharif crops - Paddy and Millet- was earlier to start from October 1, but due to heavy rains, the central government had postponed the procurement till October 11 as the moisture content in fresh arrivals was beyond permissible limits.The decision irked farmers and many of them protested on Saturday in several parts of the two states, laying siege to the houses of many ministers, MPs and MLAs.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions that is spearheading the agitation against the three central agri laws, had on Friday had given a call for holding protests outside the residences of legislators in Punjab and Haryana.

02-10-2021||New Delhi||Climate Change: India promises to engage constructively at COP 26||India will engage constructively at COP 26 and evaluate bridging proposals to conclude the Paris rulebook, which can be done by delivering on the climate finance promises of the developed countries, Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said at a pre-COP 26 meeting in Milan, Italy.Yadav highlighted that India recognises the urgency of strong climate action in this decade to ensure that the world is on track to stay within the temperature goal of the Paris agreement, as well as to adapt to its impacts and minimise loss and damage. Hence, the COP 26 outcome must emphasise the need to plug the ambition gap by delivering the means of implementation support that will allow developing countries to enhance their climate actions, he said.Yadav said India strongly believes that the only way to deliver climate goals particularly on mitigation is through concrete action on speedy, assured, and sustained finance.Climate change is embedded in India’s development strategy and the country has been a frontrunner in taking ambitious climate action, he said. However, India has a large population that is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Hence, adaptation is among the top priorities for our country, he added.Highlighting the gravity of climate finance, he stated that India strongly believes that COP 26 must initiate the process of setting the new collective long-term climate finance goal for post-2020.The Pre-COP 26 meeting was hosted by Italy from September 30 to October 2, 2021, in Milan to set the path to COP 26 and provide a platform to Parties to share insight on their expectations from the Conference which is scheduled to be held in Glasgow from October 31 to November 12.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/climate-change-india-promises-to-engage-constructively-at-cop-26-319250
02-10-2021||Ahmedabad||For residents of Sabarmati Ashram precincts, it may be last Gandhi Jayanti before they move out||For 59-year-old Hemant Chauhan, this could be the last birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi he is celebrating while living on the premises of Sabarmati Ashram here. Some 250 families which lived for decades in the vicinity of the Ashram founded by the Mahatma are preparing to shift as the government has set in motion an ambitious project to redevelop the 55-acre precincts.The association of some of these families with the Ashram dates back to the period when Gandhi himself lived here. After returning from South Africa, the Mahatma established his first Ashram in Kochrab area of Ahmedabad on May 25, 1915. It shifted to its present location on June 17, 1917.In August this year, over 130 eminent personalities, including historians Ramachandra Guha, Rajmohan Gandhi, retired High Court Justice AP Shah, and carnatic singer TM Krishna, had issued a statement opposing the redevelopment project.The statement said this most authentic monument of Mahatma Gandhi and India’s freedom struggle would be lost to “vanity and commercialisation”. But residents like Chauhan are happy with the government’s compensation package.Mahendra Vyas, 73, said it was the right decision to vacate his house on the Ashram premises where he had lived all his life. He and many others have already taken possession of their new apartments.  The government’s offer of Rs 60 lakh to purchase an apartment of their choice or a 4-BHK unit in a government scheme along with Rs 5 lakh in cash was generous, they feel. For those like Chauhan who were unwilling to shift far away from the Ashram due to emotional attachment to the area, the government has offered to construct a building nearby. “My mother made Harijan Vaas her home in 1955, and I was born here in 1962 and have lived here ever since. My two sons got married and I am blessed with three granddaughters, and we all live together in the house in the colony,” said Chauhan.“We expect the foundation stone for our new building to be laid soon. The building may or may not be completed in the next one year, but we believe the government will not disappoint us,” he said.Vyas celebrated Gandhi’s birth anniversary in his new apartment in Gota area, around 8 km away from the Ashram.  “We lived in the Harijan Vaas as tenants, as the buildings belonged to the trust. But the government’s compensation package helped us become house owners,” said Vyas, whose father shifted to the Ashram colony in 1928.The redevelopment project will improve the facilities at the Ashram for visitors who come from world-over, he said. Kartikeya Sarabhai, trustee of the Sabarmati Ashram Preservation and Memorial Trust, said the government is holding regular meetings with the six trusts who look after various activities of the Ashram.“Currently, visitors can see only Hriday Kunj, Vinoba Kutir and Sabarmati Ashram, which are spread over an area of three acres. The government plans to develop the area like the Ashram which existed during Mahatma Gandhi’s times when it was spread over 35-40 acres with 63 heritage properties,” Sarabhai said.  As many as 48 of these properties have survived, he added. Sabarmati Harijan Ashram Trust, Gujarat Khadi Gramodyog Mandal, Sabarmati Ashram Gaushala Trust, Gujarat Harijan Sevak Sangh and Khadi Gramodyog Prayog Samiti are the five other trusts that take care of the Ashram’s activities.“The main purpose of the redevelopment is to create the Ashram in a single unit by diverting the road that passes through and add some more attractions for visitors,” he said.

02-10-2021||New Delhi||Blanket ban on listing bail pleas infringes upon personal liberty of incarcerated, says SC||A blanket ban on the listing of pleas for bail or suspension of sentence infringes upon the right of personal liberty of the incarcerated, the Supreme Court has said and observed that by giving such orders a Rajasthan High Court judge went “beyond his allocated judicial business”.The apex court made the remarks in a rare case where the Rajasthan High Court approached the Supreme Court against two orders of its own judge.One order was passed on March 31 last year directing the registry to not list bail pleas, appeals, applications for suspension of sentence and revisions in the category of extreme urgent matters till the Centre lifts the nationwide complete lockdown imposed due to Covid-19 pandemic.The other order by the same judge, which was challenged by the high court was of May 17, 2021, in which police were directed not to make arrests till July 17 for offences entailing up to a three-year jail term.A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose said: “In our view, orders under appeal passed on March 31, 2020, and May 17, 2021, encroached upon the administrative power of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Rajasthan in the matter of allocation of business to judges of that Court”.The bench, while referring to various verdicts of the top court said the position of the chief justice for allocation of business to the individual judges’ stands well established in the light of the decisions of the top court.“Apart from this jurisdictional issue, on which we find the single judge went beyond his allocated judicial business, a blanket order prohibiting listing of bail applications or applications for suspension of sentence in appeals also infringe upon the right of personal liberty of incarcerated persons,” the bench said in its recent verdict.It said such right has been taken away by judicial order, without compliance of procedure established by law, which in constitutional jurisprudence, is akin to “the due process dictum”.“Right to apply for bail is an individual right implicit in Articles 14, 19, and 21 of the Constitution. The right of an accused, an undertrial prisoner or a convicted person awaiting appeal court’s verdict to seek bail on suspension of sentence is recognized in Sections 439, 438, and 389 of the CrPC,” the bench said.It said the factors guiding appeal provision is contained in the Scheduled Castes and Schedule Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and if there is a blanket ban on listing of these applications, even for offences with lesser degree of punishment that would effectively block access for seekers of liberty to apply for bail and in substance suspend the fundamental rights of individuals in or apprehending detention. Senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, who represented the High Court, had contended that decisions for listing of matters by fixing the roster rest with the chief justice of a high court and such administrative power cannot be appropriated by any bench.Dealing with the jurisdiction of the judge to pass such orders, the bench said, “Such sweeping orders in our adversarial adjudicatory system would be contrary to law as many persons would be impacted by such orders without having any knowledge of the proceeding”.The top court said: “It was also improper for the single judge to come to a general finding that when there is complete lockdown the bail applications, appeal under SC/ST Act and applications for suspension of sentence in appeals and revisions could not be considered to be matters of extreme urgency”. “The orders were passed in relation to criminal matters and would have had adverse effect on those suffering or anticipating pre-trial detention or convicts awaiting their appeals. There could be individual cases of extreme urgency for undertrial prisoners or convicts also to apply for bail, upon suspension of sentence for the latter category of litigants.”           The top court held that in the impugned orders, the judge “was in error” in picking up the categories of litigations and arrived at a finding that these categories of cases could not be considered to be of extreme urgency.  “It was also not within his jurisdiction to direct the Registrar (Judicial) not to list bail, appeals and applications for suspension of sentence in appeals and revisions in the category of extreme urgent matters,” it said.The Supreme Court said that in passing such an order, the judge had assumed administrative jurisdiction of the chief justice to allocate business to individual judges of the court. “Also, by issuing such sweeping directions, decision has been taken which should have been left to be decided by the respective Benches for determining as to whether the specific cases fell in the category of extreme urgent matters warranting listing, even during the pandemic,” the bench said.Both the orders of the judge were earlier stayed by the top court on April 3, 2020, and on May 25, 2021.The SC said though the impact of the orders under appeal no more survives, it has decided to express its opinion on the subject-controversy as the directions issued had the potential for breaching the constitutional and legal rights of individuals who could be or are arraigned in criminal action and also put fetters on power of investigating agencies. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/blanket-ban-on-listing-bail-pleas-infringes-upon-personal-liberty-of-incarcerated-says-sc-319248
02-10-2021||New Delhi||CJI hopes names recommended by Collegium will be cleared ‘very soon’, seeks govt’s cooperation||Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Saturday pressed for early clearance of the names recommended by the collegium for appointment as judges in the higher judiciary, saying he is seeking the government’s “cooperation and support” to facilitate equal access to justice and strengthen democracy.Justice Ramana, who has been actively recommending names for appointment of judges in the higher judiciary after assuming charge as the CJI on April 24, said the collegium has recommended 106 names for high court judges since May, and clearing them would take care of pendency of cases to “some extent”.Speaking at an event here, the CJI referred to the assurance given by union law minister Kiren Rijiju and said: “The government has cleared some of them (names for judgeship) and the Hon’ble Law Minister has assured that the rest of the things will come in one or two days. I thank the government for clearing these vacancies and giving quick access to justice to the people”.The CJI also noted that the Covid-19 pandemic has “exposed some deep-rooted problems” in the judiciary and underscored the need to ensure equal access to justice, especially to vulnerable sections.“My companion judges and I have attempted to enable litigants to get faster justice. I want to state that, since May onwards, my team so far has recommended the appointment of 106 Judges and nine new Chief Justices to various High Courts.“The government has cleared seven names out of the 106 judges and one out of the nine for chief justices, so far. I expect that the government will clear the rest of the names very soon. These appointments will take care of pendency to some extent. I seek the cooperation and support of the Government to enable access to justice and to strengthen democracy,” he said.The CJI, who is also the Patron-in-chief of the National Legal Services Authority, was speaking at the launch of the six-week-long ‘The Pan India Legal Awareness and Outreach Campaign’ by NALSA at Vigyan Bhavan that was inaugurated by President Ram Nath Kovind on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary.“For a healthy democracy, a vibrant judiciary is essential. Covid-19 has created many problems for many institutions including the judiciary. Thousands of cases have accumulated in different fora.“Apart from large vacancies, the non-working of courts and lack of virtual conferencing facilities in rural areas, the pandemic has exposed some deep-rooted problems,” the CJI said.The constitutional guarantee of equal justice will be rendered meaningless if vulnerable sections cannot enforce their rights, the CJI said, adding that sustainable and inclusive growth cannot be achieved without providing “inclusive access to justice” especially to the poor.The framers of our Constitution were well aware of socio-economic reality and therefore, they envisaged a welfare state where no one is denied basic needs of life, he said.“In order to protect the aforesaid rights, the framers accorded us all, the equal protection and equality before law. But this guarantee of equal justice will be rendered meaningless if the vulnerable sections cannot enforce their rights,” he said.Equality and “access to justice” complement each other and in countries with major socio-economic gaps, unequal access to justice leads to widening of these divides, he said.Every person comes across legal issues such as employment, inheritance, business or those related to family, he said, adding “suppression of unmet legal needs results in the suppression of the full potential of an individual”.“In a complex society like ours, which is full of inequities, problems tend to multiply on their own. Loss of daily wage, the prospect of eviction, lack of health care and uncertainty about the next meal- all these flow from the absence of justice. The social costs of this are unimaginable,” he said.Socio-economic justice would be impossible to achieve without providing equal access to justice, he said, adding that all the three organs of the state, the executive, the legislature and the judiciary have come together, to strive for a future based on inclusion, equality and fairness.“The key to equal access to justice lies in creating legal awareness first. Legal awareness will be the galvansing force behind the reform process that we are propagating. Only when the vulnerable classes are aware about their rights, they can shape their own future,” he said.The people should feel that law and the institutions are for everyone and in a democratic country, it is the faith and trust of the people that sustains institutions, he said.Faith of the people in constitutional institutions must be earned, he said, adding that the quality of democracy rests on the quality of justice.He also hailed NALSA for its services since its inception 25 years ago and said that it has helped people in realising their rights and entitlements, all free of cost.“Empowering and enabling the people is the key to true freedom - freedom from inequity, freedom to dream, freedom to achieve,” he said, adding that now the efforts should be turned into a movement and the NALSA should reach to “the remotest corner and to the weakest person in this country”.Speaking at the occasion, Justice UU Lalit, the senior-most judge and executive chairman of NALSA, urged senior lawyers to offer legal aid pro-bono in at least three cases per year as it would instil faith in the legal aid seekers.Referring to the concept of internship in medical colleges, he said on that line, law students can be asked to offer legal services to the poor in remote parts of the country.“I am already in touch with the Bar Council of India people and they have assured us that perhaps, I think all law colleges would be extending this kind of support,” Justice Lalit said, adding that apart from helping in legal awareness programme, law colleges and students will help NALSA in “reaching the goal and realising our expeditions”.Justice AM Khanwilkar, who heads the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee, also spoke at the event. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-hopes-names-recommended-by-collegium-will-be-cleared-very-soon-seeks-govts-cooperation-319243
02-10-2021||Ahmedabad||In Modi regime, silence is no safe harbour: Sibal||Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Saturday said remaining silent was not an option under the BJP government as it would mean one is complicit in its “atrocities”.Speaking about the turmoil within the Congress, Sibal, who is part of the so-called ‘G-23’ group of dissidents, said he did not know if the party was ready for reforms but he can only voice his own sentiments.“I don’t want to comment on that tweet of P Chidambaram as he is a dear colleague. I can only say that in politics when I talk about Modi (government), safe harbour is not silence,” Sibal told reporters here in reply to a question on a recent tweet by the former finance minister.“This is no time to be silent, if you are silent against the atrocities of the Modi government then you are complicit,” he added.Chidambaram had tweeted on September 30 that he felt helpless “when we cannot start meaningful conversations within party forums” and when one sees Congress workers shouting slogans outside the residence of a colleague and MP.“The safe harbour to which one can withdraw seems to be silence,” he had said. The tweets came after Congress workers shouted slogans against Sibal.To a question about the G-23 group, Sibal said, “There is no G-23, you called it G-23. It is a set of people who want reforms from within, that’s about it. The reforms that we want, we have spoken about in the past, there is no point in repeating it.”“I have no grievances (against the party), whatever I have said, I have said, there is nothing more that I wish to say,” Sibal said in reply to another question.Asked if the Congress leadership was not inclined to implement the reforms suggested by the group, the Rajya Sabha member said, “I don’t know if the party is ready for reforms or not, I can only voice my sentiments.” To the question whether he thought if the party was taking a strong stand against the “atrocities” of the Modi government, Sibal said the party was speaking about it. “Rahul Gandhi has raised his voice against it, that is good of Rahul Gandhi,” he added.When asked if the Congress had ceded the “middle ground” to the BJP and taken a left turn, Sibal said he disagreed.“They (BJP) have changed the rules of the game. Cricket is played by the rules of the game. If you have a doubt about an LBW or a catch, the decision is to be given by the third umpire. But here they have taken over every system and they have become umpires,” Sibal said.“ED is the umpire, CBI is the umpire, they try to influence courts, they have captured the system. If you change the rules, then there will be no middle ground,” the Congress leader said.Prime Minister Modi speaks about Mahatma Gandhi and tries to appropriate him from the Congress, but “he is doing everything opposite of what Gandhi said,” Sibal stated.On the trouble within the Punjab Congress, Sibal said, “I am a party worker, if I had been a decision-maker, I would have told you. I am a worker, and I will continue to work.”On the recent government change in the BJP-ruled Gujarat, Sibal said the chief ministers were also made to resign in Karnataka and Uttarakhand, and the saffron party also “tried to do it in Uttar Pradesh but it could not be done.”The BJP replaced governments in these states because it felt the incumbent leaders would not win it elections, the Congress leader claimed.He credited Rahul Gandhi for the Congress’ impressive performance in the 2017 Assembly polls in Gujarat, saying he came and stayed for three months and energized the party. “What is the situation now in Gujarat Congress I don’t know,” he added.

It cannot become Punjab. The two states have only one similarity that both have numbers in their names,” Baghel told reporters at the helipad here when asked that the BJP has equated Chhattisgarh and Punjab over turmoil in the ruling Congress.“Punjab is land of punj (five) aab (water). It is made up of five rivers. Similarly Chhattisgarh has derived its name from ‘chhattis’ (thirty six) ‘garh’ (fort). No other states have numbers in their names. There is no other similarity between the two states,” he added.The political corridor in Chhattisgarh has been rife with speculation of possible leadership change in the Congress government soon as around two dozen party MLAs, considered close to Baghel, flew to Delhi in the last three days.While the purpose of their trip is yet to become clear, some party sources said the MLAs were visiting the national capital to express solidarity with Baghel.The CM had said on Thursday that the visit by Congress MLAs to Delhi should not be seen through the prism of politics.When asked on Saturday about the MLAs’ trip to Delhi, Baghel said, there is no ban on the legislators from going somewhere and they are independent.“It is not a political movement. You ask if it is a political movement. They will visit and return,” he added.Health Minister T S Singh Deo, who is apparently seeking to replace Baghel, too, played down the visit by MLAs to Delhi as he had said it should not be made an issue.About the possible leadership change, Singh Deo had reiterated that the decision is reserved with the party high command.Brihaspat Singh, who is among the legislators who were in Delhi, had said on Wednesday that 15 to 16 party legislators were in Delhi to meet P L Punia ahead of Rahul Gandhi’s proposed tour of the state. Singh is considered to be close to Baghel.The buzz about possible leadership change began after Baghel completed two-and-a-half years as chief minister in June 2021. The Singh Deo camp claimed the top Congress leadership in 2018 had agreed to hand over the CM’s post to him after the government completed half its term.

The people who are tweeting ‘Godse Zindabad’ should be named and shamed publicly. The lunatic fringe must not be allowed to enter the mainstream,” he said.The Lok Sabha member’s comments came amid “Nathuram Godse Zindabad” (long live Nathuram Godse) being among the top Twitter trends on the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi.A section of right wingers have often posted comments eulogising the man, who shot dead Mahatma Gandhi on January 30, 1948, especially on the days linked to India’s most famous freedom fighter.

02-10-2021||---||I always look forward to healthy criticism and miss genuine critics: Modi||New Delhi, October 2Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that he always looks forward to healthy criticism and misses genuine critics.In an interview to a magazine, the PM while responding to queries that the opposition has not been able to figure him out said, “The problem here is not Modi…but when any person tries to see anything with a preconceived mindset, then either he is able to see only half of the view or is inspired to see wrong things. And if he is not able to see anything as per his preconceived notion, then he creates a perception to feed his preconceived mindset."PM questions opposition’s ‘intellectual dishonesty’on farm lawsHe said if someone had only analysed his work there would not be any confusion."After I became chief minister, the first thing I did, about 20 years ago, when I didn’t have any prior experience of administration…I first of all went to the people affected by the Kutch earthquake. I publicly stated that this is the first Diwali after the earthquake, so we will not celebrate it and I was there with the families of the earthquake victims on the day of Diwali and shared their suffering," the PM said.He added that he did not have even a remote connection with politics and plunged into it after the earthquake of Kutch."From the younger days, my bent of mind was spiritual. The tenet of ‘Jan Seva Hi Prabhu Seva’ always inspired me. And the first public function I did after becoming CM was the Garib Kalyan Mela. If someone would have understood all this, then the work done by me today, like building toilets in poor people’s homes or providing free ration to the poor, would have been easier for them to understand," he said.The PM said it is not as though he has no faults."For my own healthy development, I attach a big importance to criticism. I, with an honest mind, respect critics a lot. But, unfortunately, the number of critics is very few. Mostly, people only level allegations, the people who play games about perception are more in number. And the reason for this is that, for criticism, one has to do a lot of hard work and research, and in today’s fast-paced world, maybe people don’t have time. So sometimes, I miss critics," the PM added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-always-look-forward-to-healthy-criticism-and-miss-genuine-critics-modi-319217

It also said that people who do not smoke also suffer from lung cancer.The insurance company had rejected the claim of Rs 93,297 incurred by policy holder Alok Kumar Banerjee on treatment of his “adenocarcinoma of lung” or lung cancer, at a private hospital, on the ground that he was addicted to smoking as mentioned on his treatment papers.Banerjee’s wife, Smita, challenged this in the Ahmedabad Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission together with Consumer Education and Research Centre.On September 30, the consumer court allowed her petition and observed that there is no evidence to prove that her husband was addicted to smoking, apart from the mention of “addiction smoking” on the treatment papers. Neither was any clarification of evidence sought from the doctor who made the same observation. Observations made in discharge summary or treatment papers alone cannot be counted as conclusive proof. Independent proof is required to be presented to support the claim, it said.“The complainant’s husband had lung cancer, but there is no proof to ascertain that it was due to his addiction to smoking. The insurer has presented a report from a doctor that says that smokers are 25 times more likely to get lung cancer, but that alone does not prove that he suffered from lung cancer due to smoking,” said the order passed by commission’s president K S Patel and member K P Mehta.“People who do not smoke also suffer from lung cancer, and all those who smoke do not necessarily suffer from lung cancer. Therefore, the Commission is of the opinion that the insurance company falsely rejected the claim without providing any conclusive proof in its support,” it said.The court ordered the insurance company to pay Rs 93,297 as claim with 7 per cent interest from the date of application on August 2, 2016. Further, the insurer will pay Rs 3,000 for mental torture and Rs 2,000 towards cost of litigation within 30 days, it said.The policy was valid between May 2014 and 2015, and the complainant’s husband was treated on July 29, 2014 and incurred a cost of Rs 93,297 over treatment which he claimed form the insurer.The insurer rejected the claim and said in its repudiation letter that the complainant is not qualified for the claim as per the policy terms and conditions, as he was addicted to smoking. This is based on the hospital papers which mention “addiction smoking,” it said.The complainant was a chain smoker and was suffering from lung cancer and had sought treatment in different hospitals. He got cancer due to his smoking habit, as smoking and lung cancer are directly related,  the insurance company said in its reply to the court.

The reason they didn't do so is because they were not aware of the shortage of water…flush with abundance of water in their houses, swimming pools, they had not seen and experienced pangs of poverty…”“Poverty to them was a mere intellectual marvel and titillation to be adorned in literature and books. They loved villages to be in penury and hardships,” Modi said.JJM, which was launched on August 15, 2019, aims to provide piped drinking water to every rural household in the country by 2024. To mark Gandhi’s birth anniversary, gram sabhas were organised across the country to discuss implementation of JJM, water security, and kindred issues, including conservation of water.“Empowerment of villages is the priority of my government,” Modi said. He said that before JJM was launched only over three crore people had piped water supply; now, more than eight crore households are provided tap water.As on date, about 8.26 crore (43 per cent) rural households have tap water supply in their homes.Every rural household in 78 districts, 58 thousand gram panchayats and 1.16 lakh villages is getting tap water supply. Till now, tap water supply has been provided in 7.72 lakh (76 per cent) schools and 7.48 lakh (67.5 per cent) anganwadi centres.Of over 6 lakh villages, Pani Samitis/VWSCs have been constituted in around 3.5 lakh villages under JJM. More than 7.1 lakh women have been trained to test the quality of water by using field test kits.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-takes-a-jibe-at-earlier-govts-for-not-addressing-poverty-water-issues-319175

All under the shadow of the Covid pandemic, which continues to devastate people and economies alike,” the UN chief said.On this year's observance of the International Day of Non-Violence, Guterres said “let us heed” Gandhi's message of peace, “and get down to the business of building a better and more peaceful future for all”.“We call on combatants around the world to lay down their arms and focus on defeating humanity's common enemy—Covid—not one another,” he said, underlining the urgent need to deliver life-saving vaccines and treatment, and support countries in the long road to recovery ahead.

India is going to play one of the most important roles on planet earth in bringing this pandemic to an end. Because of its innovation, because of the investments that have been made over a long period of time in expanding vaccine manufacturing capacity,” United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Administrator Samantha Power said.“...Right now we're in a really difficult period because there are significant vaccine shortages as you know. And... India is very soon going to be back online. As a critical engine in meeting the targets that the world's leaders just rallied behind at the Covid summit, which is mainly to get 70 per cent of each of the world's country's populations vaccinated by the UN General Assembly next year,” she said.“I think it's also India as an inspiration. You know, we -- and I'll stay on Covid, just because it's certainly the topic of our time, along with the climate. But in both domains, in fact. You know, as India innovates in its transition to renewables, on the climate front, as it extends its vaccine manufacturing capacity,” Power said, participating in the USAID discussion with former US Ambassador to India Richard Verma.Speaking at the virtual event, Power said, “Not only for Covid vaccines but now to make itself again a hub for vaccinations for other diseases that have been concentrated in the developed world.  That manufacturing capacity, that's giving a lot of countries ideas. We are talking of Rwanda, Senegal, we just, through the Development Finance Corporation, made a big investment in South Africa." “Once India is in a position, you know, to move past Covid in a way that, of course, is in the interests of the Indian people to do. And we're seeking to support them to do. For it to bring its expertise to bear on how a country like South Africa can extend already what it is doing in the manufacturing space,” Power said.

02-10-2021||United Nations||‘I got Covishield from India’, says 76th UN General Assembly president Abdulla Shahid||President of the 76th session of the UN General Assembly Abdulla Shahid has said he had received the two doses of the Covishield vaccine manufactured in India, as had a “large portion” of other countries around the world.Also read: India going to play most important role in bringing this pandemic to end, says top Biden admn officialThe Covishield vaccine, which has been developed by British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, is manufactured in India by Pune-based Serum Institute of India."On vaccines, that's a very technical question you have asked me. I got Covishield from India, I've got the two doses. I don't know how many countries would say that Covishield is acceptable or not, but a large portion of the countries have got Covishield,” Shahid said at his first press conference here on Friday.He was responding to a question on whether any Covid vaccine should be recognised and considered or the ones that have been validated by the World Health Organisation or any other group.“And I've survived. But let someone else, a medical person, make that call, not me,” he added with a laugh.India has exported over 66 million vaccine doses to nearly 100 countries through grants, commercial shipments and the COVAX facility. The Maldives, home country of Shahid, was among the first nations to receive the India-made vaccines in January when 100,000 doses of Covishield were dispatched to Male.In all, the Maldives has received a total of 3.12 lakh doses of Made-in-India Covid vaccines through grants, commercial shipments and the COVAX facility.The UK had initially refused to recognise Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. However, following India's strong criticism of the decision, the UK on September 22 amended its new guidelines and included the vaccine.However, the move did not provide any relief from quarantine rules for Indian travellers vaccinated with two doses of Covishield. Later, British officials said the UK had issues with India's vaccine certification process and not with the Covishield vaccine.Under the new British rules that are coming into effect from Monday, fully vaccinated Indians will have to undergo 10-day quarantine as the UK has issues with India's Covid-19 vaccine certification.India has decided to impose reciprocal curbs against all British nationals arriving in the country, official sources in New Delhi said on Friday, as the contentious issue relating to the UK not recognising Indian vaccine certificates could not be resolved despite holding a series of technical-level talks.Shahid, who plans to convene a high-level meeting of the General Assembly in January to take stock of the global vaccination effort and equity, said the message that he had received so far on vaccines in listening to world leaders at the General Debate, “has been most positive from the United States, from China, from India, from many, many corners of the world, from the vaccine producers themselves”.“And I intend to utilise the convening power of the president of the General Assembly to bring all of them together in January, and my desire is to make sure that we all come out of the January meeting with a much more optimistic timeline where hereby we will be able to vaccinate the entire world by end of 2022,” he said.

But the incident only came to light two days later after a fully burnt car with a dead body on the driver's seat was discovered in a forest area.The arrested persons have been identified as the victim's wife Binu (42), his elder son Vivek (21), younger son Vishnu (19), Binu's sister's son Ashok (23) and Vinod's brother Sanjay (36).The arrests were made on Friday.After killing Vinod, the accused transported the body in a car to the Hunasekoppa forest area and torched it to make it look like a case of suicide, according to the police.The police added that the victim fought with his family over an affair with a lady from a neighbouring town. The issue created a rift in the relationship between him and all his family members. Recently, Vinod had sold his land and planned to give a major share to his friend. He was also planning to sell off another property.The family members upset with the conduct of Vinod hatched a conspiracy to kill him, the police said.The accused purchased petrol and made other preparations on September 26. They allegedly strangulated Vinod with an iron wire and smashed his head with an iron rod, after which his body was placed in the car, which they later torched.Meanwhile, the Theerthahalli police who traced the burnt car initially thought it to be a case of suicide.But when the police started inquiring the family members, their statements differed from each other.The five accused have been sent to judicial custody.

All are waiting to cross over to Pakistan since September 23.Camping at a parking lot near the International Check Post (ICP), the group caught the attention of Saurab and Mandeep, who run a sweet shop nearby.“It had already been 24 hours and none of them had hardly purchased any food or cooked anything. It seemed odd as the group has 47 children under the age of 10 years. They seemed poor but we had no idea that they were so broke,” said Saurab.Next, the duo discussed the issue with others at the village. “It was already 5 pm. We decided that women would make chapattis and men would cook daal. By 6.30 pm, we had 800 chapattis — much more than we needed,” said Jodhbir Singh, a former panchayat member from Attari.“Ever since that evening, the residents are providing three meals, tea and medicines to them. Another resident of the village purchased 100 steel bowls for them as they had no utensils. Some have given clothes to the children,” said Jasbir Singh Sahoora, president, Ex-serviceman Sainik Welfare Society.The residents have also convinced the parking contractor to open toilets for them. Instead of sleeping in the open, like they did on the first day, they now use the sheds of nearby dhabas.As the group has at least six children below the age of six months (who were born in India), the youth from Rorawala village give them 10 litre milk every day. “The milk is delivered to Saurab’s shop, who keeps it refrigerated and gives it to children’s mothers whenever they ask for it,” said Jaswinder Singh, another ex-serviceman.While most of them are from Sanghar district of Sindh province, a few of them are from West Punjab. A few of them had come to India for “Ganga Snan” before the lockdown was announced in March last year and were stranded. There are others, too, who came in 2017 and later on the same pretext overstayed their visa.Kewal Das, a member of the group, said all of them had been staying in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. “The authorities here say that we require permission from the Jodhpur police for which we have applied now,” said Mohan, who had come to India in 2018.Maghia Ram from Rahim Yar Khan district of West Punjab said: “We request the officials concerned to expedite the process of sending us home as soon as possible.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/99-pak-hindus-get-help-from-local-community-gurdwaras-to-stay-afloat-319111

The residents around… are they happy with the protest? This business should stop. You are obstructing security and defence personnel. This was in the media. All this should stop…. There has to be a balanced approach,” a Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar told the counsel for Kisan Mahapanchayat.“There is no point in protest once you come to the court challenging the laws,” the Bench told the farmers’ body during hearing on its petition seeking directions to the Centre, Delhi Lt Governor and Delhi Police Commissioner to allow it to stage “satyagraha” at Jantar Mantar in the Capital.“Are you protesting against the judicial system? Once you have approached the judicial system, have faith in the court. You pursue that matter for urgent hearing instead of protesting again,” the Bench told the counsel for Kisan Mahapanchayat, who said the farmers’ body did have faith in the court. After the petitioner’s counsel denied that farmers blocked highways, the Bench asked him to declare it on an affidavit and posted it for hearing on Monday.This is the second consecutive day that the Supreme Court has questioned the continued blockade of roads by protesting farmers. On Thursday, the court had wondered how highways could be blocked perpetually. “The redressal of problems can be through judicial forum, agitation or through parliamentary debates. But how can the highways be blocked and this is happening perpetually. Where does this end?” another Bench led by Justice SK Kaul had asked. It had said it was the duty of the executive to implement the law laid down by it.Maintaining that farmers had the right to protest, the top court on Friday emphasised that citizens also enjoyed equal right to move freely and without fear. “Their (citizens’) properties are being damaged. Do you take permission from the residents around whether they are happy with your protest…. This coaxing business should stop,” it said.Citing media reports, the Bench pointed out that even security personnel were obstructed, stopped and heckled during the protests.As the petitioner’s counsel said the farmers were holding peaceful protests, the Bench shot back, “What’s this peaceful protest? You block trains, highways and then you say your protest is peaceful and without causing any harm to the public.”On January 12 this year, the top court stayed the implementation of the three farm laws — the Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act and Amendment to Essential Commodities Act.It had constituted a four-member panel to hear stakeholders’ views and report back to it.

The media will be informed of the government’s decision as and when it is taken.”Sources, however, confirmed that the bids put in by Tata Sons and SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh were opened a few days ago and vetted last Wednesday by the core group of secretaries on disinvestment, a body headed by the Cabinet Secretary.They also confirmed that the bids were evaluated against the reserve price and Tata Sons emerged as the highest bidder. The highest bid would now be placed before the ministerial committee.Incidentally, if Tata Sons’ bid is accepted, one of India’s oldest industrial conglomerates will take over the national carrier that it once founded. Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy (JRD) Tata had founded the airline in 1932, called Tata Airlines then.In 1946, the aviation division of Tata Sons was listed as Air India and in 1948, Air India International was launched with flights to Europe. The international service was among the first public-private partnerships in India, with the government holding 49 percent, Tatas 25 per cent and the public owning the rest. But in 1953, Air India was nationalised.

The naval exercise, ‘MILAN 2022’, is scheduled for March next year in Visakhapatnam. The invitations have been sent to 46 countries, senior official said today.Some of the nations have confirmed their participation. Among the countries that have been reportedly invited are the Quad nations — the US, Japan and Australia.The exercise is conducted once in two years. The one in 2020 was cancelled due to the Covid pandemic. The exercise MILAN, which commenced two decades ago, was conducted at Port Blair, Andaman Nicobar. Since the space for berthing of warships at the islands was limited, Visakhapatnam was chosen. This will be the first multi-nation exercise of such a scale since the military stand-off in Eastern Ladakh and the laying down of agenda of cooperation by the Quad in the Indo-Pacific.Sources say all those who were on the invite list in 2020 have been invited this time as well. This includes countries located east and west of India such as Saudi Arabia, Israel, New Zealand, the UAE, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Bangladesh, France, Kuwait and Myanmar.Also on the invite list are countries which are locked in a dispute with China over territorial boundaries in the South China Sea. The invitees include Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and the Philippines. These nations are locked in framing a “code of conduct” on navy and cargo operating in the South China Sea.China, which has lost its argument at the United Nations on defining territorial waters under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), has refused to accept the verdict. It has opened its own negotiations to establish a “code of conduct” in the hydro-carbon rich sea.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-plans-jumbo-46-nation-naval-exercise-318947

He also interacted with the troops and complimented them for their resoluteness and high morale,” an Army spokesperson said.His visit to the region came a day after he said that the “unprecedented” military standoff with China required an immediate response and large-scale mobilisation of resources at a time when the country was faced with the coronavirus pandemic.“The unprecedented developments necessitated large scale resource mobilisation, orchestration of forces and immediate response, all this in a Covid-infested environment,” he said while delivering a lecture at an industry chamber on Thursday.Also on Thursday, India hit out at China for attempting to blame it for the border row and asserted that the “provocative” behaviour and “unilateral” attempts by the Chinese military to alter the status quo along the LAC in the region seriously disturbed peace and tranquillity.The comments by External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi came in response to China’s fresh allegations that the “root cause” of the tensions between the two countries was New Delhi following a “forward policy” and “illegally” encroaching Chinese territory.The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year in eastern Ladakh following a violent clash in the Pangong lake area.Both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in the Gogra area last month.In February, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in line with an agreement on disengagement.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.

The grain will become vulnerable to shriveling, blackening, discolouration and prone to infestation. This may lead to rejection at procurement centres and would lead to distress sale of paddy and consequent loss to the farmers,” officials said, adding that the Haryana government had also written to the Centre intimating about the untimely rain and requested for relaxation in moisture content in the paddy.“The better course would be to harvest the paddy crop offered after a period of 10 days, that is after proper maturity then the problem of moisture in the paddy grain can be minimised.  Accordingly, the governments of Punjab and Haryana have also been requested to advise their agencies to dry the paddy already arrived and further produce may be brought to the mandi after proper drying,” the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said a day after it announced that paddy procurement in Punjab and Haryana will start from October 11.According to officials, widespread untimely showers across Punjab and Haryana during the second fortnight of September have affected the standing paddy crop in both the agrarian states. The maximum temperature at most of the places has also been recorded below normal due to downpour. “There was heavy downpour on September 29 and 30 in some parts of the states of Punjab and Haryana. Because of the untimely rains, maturity of paddy grains is delayed,” they said. Quoting the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), officials said rainfall during September 2021 is 77% and 139% above normal in Punjab and Haryana, respectively.“On the basis of moisture content check by FCI’s regional offices at Punjab and Haryana, it was reported that paddy samples are having moisture ranging from 18% to 22% in Punjab and 18.2% to 22.7% in Haryana against the permissible limit of 17%.“Accordingly, to save farmers from inconvenience and to protect farmer’s interest, the Centre decided that procurement of paddy under MSP operation would commence from October 11 in Punjab and Haryana and advised all agencies to gear up for drying the paddy to help farmers,” they added.Stating that procurement at high moisture content is fraught with risk of increase in damage percentage of rice grain, they said: “The better course would be to harvest the paddy crop offered after a period of 10 days, that is after proper maturity then the problem of moisture in the paddy grain can be minimised. Accordingly, state governments of Punjab and Haryana have also been requested to advise their agencies to dry the paddy already arrived and further produce may be brought to the mandi after proper drying.“The decision to start the procurement of paddy under MSP from October 11 in Punjab and Haryana is in the overall interest of farmers and consumers as well as to accept paddy stock as per FAQ specifications to ensure quality procurement for millions of consumers under PDS of National Food Security Programme. However, moisture content is the main determining factor,” they added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-cites-high-moisture-content-for-postponement-of-paddy-procurement-in-punjab-haryana-318797

They will also have to undergo mandatory quarantine at home or in the destination address for 10 days after arrival in India.Authorities in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Ministry of Civil Aviation have been asked to take steps to implement the new measures, said the sources.The action comes after 10 days of inaction by London after External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had met UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and pressed for an early resolution of the quarantine issue in “mutual interest’’.Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla was more forthright. “I have raised the discriminatory nature of UK vaccine recognition for AstraZeneca but not Covishield. Discussions on, but if they do not satisfy us, we would be well within our rights to take reciprocal action,’’ he had observed. Congress leader Shashi Tharoor had cancelled a visit to Britain as its “offensive to ask fully vaccinated Indians to quarantine’’. Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan had also asked London to find a quick solution or India or be prepared for consequences.Australia okays CovishieldAustralia declares two jabs of the India-made Covishield as “recognised” for international travellers as part of its next steps to safely reopen to the world. It also simultaneously approved the Chinese vaccine Sinovac as it prepares to open its money-spinning educational institutions where students from these two countries form the majority.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-imposes-reciprocity-makes-10-day-quarantine-must-for-uk-travellers-318788

02-10-2021||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: IAF officer accused of rape handed over to Air Force||A 29-year-old Flight Lieutenant with the Indian Air Force, who was charged for allegedly raping his colleague at the IAF Administrative College at Red Fields, Coimbatore was handed over to the Air Force.Judge (in-charge) N. Thilageswari of the Mahila Court, Coimbatore on Thursday had directed the police to hand over the case to the Indian Air Force. The IAF had argued that under the provisions of the Indian Air Force Act 1950, the case should be handed over to them for court-martial proceedings.N. Sundaravadivelu, the counsel of the accused argued that the case is probed only by court-martial and if proved guilty, he would be punished.However, the Coimbatore All Women Police, who had taken the accused in custody, argued that he be handed over to them for further questioning. The police requested two days of custody of the accused officer.The advocate appearing for the accused also stated that the IAF should take cognizance of the FIR registered by the City police and that investigation cannot be continued without the documents collected by the civil police.The Flight Lieutenant was arrested on September 25 after a 28-year-old woman IAF officer complained that she was sexually assaulted by the accused entering her room while she was sleeping after taking a medication.According to the FIR of the Coimbatore Police, the woman IAF officer has alleged that the IAF officers, including the medical officers, were trying to put pressure on her to withdraw the complaint. She also complained to the Supreme Court that she was subjected to the "two-finger" test by the Air Force medical department.The accused Flight Lieutenant was taken to the Air Force Administrative College, Red Fields immediately after the court pronounced the judgment.The National Commission for Women has taken cognizance of the controversial “two-finger” test, which several women’s rights activists have condemned in the past as humiliating and insensitive, has issued a notice.The outmoded two-finger test, which supposedly measures vaginal laxity, involves a medical professional inserting two fingers into a woman’s most private part. The test has long been seen as unethical and a violation of an individual’s privacy, with the Supreme Court calling for better medical tests to confirm sexual assault in its 2013 verdict and the Indian Council for Medical Research calling it unscientific in 2014.  —AgenciesNational Commission For Women writes to Air Chief Marshal regarding a woman Air Force officer allegedly being subjected to the banned two finger test by doctors after she complained about sexual assault by a Flight Lieutenant at Air Force Administrative College in Coimbatore. pic.twitter.com/IvHPEpS5gQ||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tamil-nadu-iaf-officer-accused-of-rape-handed-over-to-air-force-318748

He should do a rethink, and not help the BJP directly or indirectly,” said Rawat.Capt rejects Rawat’s claims, says Congress clearly on back foot in Punjab nowTaking strong exception to Harish Rawat’s no-holds barred attack against him, former Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday rejected the Congress Punjab in-charge’s outrageous claims and allegations, which he said were clearly prompted by the pathetic situation the party now found itself in the state after being on a winning spree for four and a half years.“Three weeks before stepping down as CM, I had offered my resignation to Mrs. Sonia Gandhi but she had asked me to continue,” said Capt Amarinder, adding that the humiliating manner in which he was pushed into resigning just hours before the CLP meeting, which was clearly convened to oust him, was a matter of public record.“The world saw the humiliation and the insult heaped on me, and yet Mr. Rawat is making claims to the contrary,” he remarked, adding “If this was not humiliation then what was it?”Rawat, he said, should put himself in his (Capt Amarinder’s) shoes, and then, perhaps, he would realise how insulting the entire affair was.The former chief minister of Punjab recalled that Rawat himself had publicly stated after meeting him that he was satisfied by his government’s track record on the 2017 poll promises.In fact, the Congress in-charge of Punjab had categorically stated, as recently as September 1, that the 2022 elections would be fought under his (Capt Amarinder’s) leadership and the high command had no intention of replacing him, he pointed out.“So how can he now claim that the party leadership was dissatisfied with me, and if they were, then why did he deliberately keep me in the dark all this time?” he asked.Ridiculing Rawat’s remarks that he (Capt Amarinder) seemed to be under pressure, the former chief minister said the only pressure he had been under for the past few months was that of his own loyalty to the Congress, because of which he continued to tolerate insult after insult.“If the party did not intend to humiliate me then why was Navjot Singh Sidhu allowed to openly criticise and attack me on social media and other public platforms for months? Why did the party give the rebels, led by Sidhu, a free hand in undermining my authority? Why was no cognisance given to the uninterrupted spree of electoral wins I handed over to the party through the 4 and a half years I was in the saddle?” he asked.Capt Amarinder asked why the Congress was allowing Sidhu even now to hold the party to ransom and continue to dictate terms.“What is the pressure he exerts on the party leadership that they are so defenceless against him and are allowing him to have his way even to the cost of the Congress’ future in Punjab?” he asked.Reacting to Rawat’s comment regarding his secular credentials, Capt Amarinder said even his worst critics and enemies could not doubt his integrity in this regard.“But I am no longer surprised that a senior and seasoned Congress leader like Mr. Rawat is questioning my secular credentials. It is quite evident that I am no longer trusted and respected in the party that I have served loyally all these years,” he added.Categorically denying Rawat’s allegation that he (Capt Amarinder) had refused to meet Channi after the latter’s swearing-in, the former chief minister said Channi had called him up on the day of his swearing-in and was supposed to come over but failed to turn up.As for not taking Rawat’s calls, Capt Amarinder said it was all humbug. “We spoke just a day before the CLP meeting was called. Mr. Rawat told me then there was nothing in the works and even claimed he had not seen any letter sent by 43 MLAs. I am shocked at the blatant way in which he is now lying about this,” the former chief minister added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rawat-questions-amarinders-closeness-to-bjp-says-insulted-by-congress-charge-baseless-capt-hits-back-318733
02-10-2021||Satya Prakash||You have strangulated entire city, now you want to come inside and protest, SC tells farmers’ body||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 1The farmers protesting against farm laws received a rap on the knuckles on Friday from the Supreme Court which questioned the rationale behind blocking of roads even after approaching the judiciary and reminded them that citizens have equal rights to move freely without fear.”You have strangulated the entire city, now you want to come inside the city and start protesting again here … The residents around … are they happy with the protest? This business should stop. You are obstructing security and defence personnel. This was in the media. All this should stop … There has to be a balanced approach,” a Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar told the counsel for ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’.“There is no point in protest once you come to the court challenging the laws”, the Bench told the farmers’ body during hearing on its petition seeking directions to the Centre, Delhi Lt. Governor and Delhi Police Commissioner to allow it to stage ‘satyagraha’ at Jantar Mantar in the National Capital.“Are you protesting against the judicial system? Once you have approached the judicial system, have faith in the court. You pursue that matter for urgent hearing instead of protesting again,” the Bench told the counsel for Kisan Mahapanchayat who said the farmers’ body did have faith in the court.After the petitioner’s counsel denied that farmers blocked highways, the Bench asked him to declare it on an affidavit and posted it for hearing on Monday.This is the second consecutive day that the Supreme Court has questioned the continued blockade of roads by protesting farmers. On Thursday, the court had wondered how highways can be blocked perpetually. “The redressal of problems can be through judicial forum, agitation or through parliamentary debates. But how can the highways be blocked, and this is happening perpetually. Where does this end?” another Bench led by Justice SK Kaul had asked. It had said it’s the duty of the executive to implement the law laid down by it.Maintaining that farmers had the right to protest, the top court on Friday emphasised that citizens also enjoyed equal right to move freely and without fear. “Their (citizens’) properties are being damaged. Do you take permission from the residents around whether they are happy with your protest … This coaxing business should stop,” it said.Citing media reports, the Bench pointed out that even security personnel were obstructed, stopped and heckled during the protests.As the petitioner’s counsel said the farmers are holding peaceful protests, the Bench shot back, ”What’s this peaceful protest? You block trains, highways and then you say your protest is peaceful and without causing any harm to the public.”On January 12 this year, the top court stayed the implementation of the three farm laws—the Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act 2020, Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act & Amendment to Essential Commodities Act.It had constituted a four-member panel comprising Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director South Asia international Food Policy), Shetkari Sanghatana President Anil Ghanwat and agriculture-economist and former Chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) Ashok Gulati to hear the various stakeholders’ views on and report back to it. The fourth member of the panel Bhartiya Kisan Union President Bhupinder Singh Mann had recused himself. The panel submitted its report to the court in March.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/you-have-strangulated-entire-city-now-you-want-to-come-inside-and-protest-sc-tells-farmers-body-318723
