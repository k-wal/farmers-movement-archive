However, the cement barricades are still there and the road remains closed for commuters, an officer said.In videos doing the rounds on social media, JCB machines were seen removing blockades at the Tikri border.Sources in the Delhi Police said that such exercise is likely to be launched at Singhu and Ghazipur border points in the coming days.Thousands of farmers have been camping at the three borders points --- Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur --- protesting the Centre's three farm laws since November 26, 2020.About the removal of blockades at the Tikri Border on Thursday night, a senior police officer said some layers of barricades that were placed by the police have been removed."The arrangement at the Tikri border in terms of infrastructure has been reduced. Seven to eight layers of different types of barricades were placed earlier and we have removed some of them," the officer said.This is done as a move to open the road for traffic soon, he said."At present, there is no traffic flow as the roads are closed. Barricades will be completely removed soon to slowly ease the flow of traffic," the officer added.The Supreme Court on October 21 had said farmers protesting at Delhi borders against the three farms laws have the right to agitate but they cannot block roads indefinitely even as the farmer unions and the government got embroiled in a blame game.While the farmers' unions alleged that the police were responsible for the blockade as it suits them to allow a feeling among citizens that farmers are blocking the road, the Centre said there was an oblique purpose behind the protests.After the court hearing, the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), whose supporters and office-bearers led by Rakesh Tikait are camping at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border since November 2020, had said the barriers at the protest site have been put by the Delhi police and not farmers.Tikait, the national spokesperson of the BKU, said protesters at Ghazipur have cleared the path on a service lane leading to the national capital but Delhi Police's barricades were still present there.

28-10-2021||United Nations/Geneva||We trust Indian industry, Bharat Biotech has been submitting data regularly, very quickly: WHO official on Covaxin EUL||India’s Bharat Biotech has been submitting data on the EUL of Covaxin “regularly and very quickly” to a technical committee which hopes to have a final recommendation to the WHO next week, a top official of the global health agency said on Thursday, stressing that the UN body “trusts” the Indian industry that manufactures high quality vaccines.Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, which has developed Covaxin, had submitted EOI (Expression of Interest) to the World Health Organisation on April 19 for the vaccine’s Emergency Use Listing (EUL).A technical advisory group of the UN health agency which met on Tuesday has sought “additional clarifications” from Bharat Biotech for Covaxin to conduct a final “risk-benefit assessment” for Emergency Use Listing of the vaccine. The technical advisory group will now meet on November 3 for a final assessment.“Bharat has been submitting data regularly and very quickly, but they submitted the last batch of data on the 18th of October,” Dr Mariangela Simao, Assistant Director General, Access to Medicines and Health Products at WHO, said at a press briefing in Geneva.She was responding to a question on the delay in granting the Emergency Use Listing to Covaxin while Chinese vaccines Sinopharm and Sinovac were given approval even “with lack of data”.Simao said that when the technical advisory group met on October 26 to discuss the EUL for Covaxin, they asked Bharat Biotech for additional clarifications.She said WHO is in touch with Bharat Biotech and has “daily conversations” and calls and meetings “clarifying what additional data needs” to be submitted to the technical expert group.“Let me just clarify and without wanting to mention any specific manufacturer but saying that we have assessed an Indian manufacturer earlier in the year and it took 30 days,” she said, a reference to the Serum Institute of India which manufactures the AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine.“So this is not about moving quicker with one or another vaccine…We really trust the Indian industry. India produces different majority of vaccines in the world, high quality vaccines. We are right now at the last stage of the assessment by this external advisory group and we hope to have a final recommendation to the WHO next week. I hope that’s well understood.”Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s Covishield are the two widely used vaccines in India.The WHO has so far approved Covid-19 vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca-SK Bio/Serum Institute of India, Johnson & Johnson-Janssen, Moderna, and Sinopharm for emergency use. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-trust-indian-industry-bharat-biotech-has-been-submitting-data-regularly-very-quickly-who-official-on-covaxin-eul-331002
28-10-2021||New Delhi||Govt seeks details of Facebook’s algorithms, processes amid hate speech allegations: Sources||Amid allegations of Facebook’s system fuelling hate speech and fake news, the government has asked the US-based social media giant to provide details of algorithms and processes used by it, sources aware of the matter said.The Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeITY) is learnt to have sought a clarification from the platform following recent revelations by whistle-blower Frances Haugen.These revelations have led to concerns that Facebook has done little to shed its ‘growth at all costs’ culture that turbocharged its rise to capture 2.91 billion monthly active users globally, including over 400 million in India.Researchers at the social media giant had pointed out that there are groups and pages “replete with inflammatory and misleading anti-Muslim content” on its platform, as per US media reports.According to the sources privy to the development, MeitY has written to Facebook asking for information around the algorithms and processes used by the platform.The government has also asked Facebook to provide details of steps taken to safeguard users, they added.When contacted, Facebook declined to comment.Haugen, an employee of the Facebook integrity team until May 2021, leaked tens of thousands of internal documents, including many from employee discussion sites, company presentations and research papers, that have unveiled the inner workings of Facebook.She has suggested that Facebook made changes to its “dangerous” algorithms that contributed to divisiveness in society, and realised these tweaks kept people returning to the platform.She has also filed eight complaints against the company with US securities regulator.The latest revelations assume significance as the social media giant has been under the lens for the past many years for not doing enough to curb hate speech on its platform and to safeguard data of its users.Facebook, in turn, has sought to portray Haugen as a junior employee cherry-picking to fit her own narrative, with little knowledge of some of the issues on which she has taken a view.On Saturday, The New York Times said that in February 2019, a Facebook researcher created a new user account to look into what the social media website will look like for a person living in Kerala.For the next three weeks, the account followed all the recommendations generated by Facebook’s algorithms to join groups, watch videos and explore new pages on the site. The result was documented in an internal Facebook report that showed a struggle with misinformation, hate speech and celebrations of violence in the country, the company’s biggest market, as per the NYT report.The documents are part of a larger collection of material collected by Haugen, who recently testified before the Senate about the company and its platforms.A Facebook spokesman had stated that Facebook has reduced the amount of hate speech that people see globally by half this year.As per data cited by the Indian government earlier this year, there are 53 crore WhatsApp users, 41 crore Facebook subscribers and 21 crore Instagram account holders in the country.It is pertinent to mention here that India enforced new IT intermediary rules earlier this year, aiming to bring greater accountability for big tech companies, including Twitter and Facebook.The rules require social media platforms to remove any content flagged by authorities within 36 hours and set up a robust complaint redressal mechanism with an officer being based in the country. Social media companies are required to take down posts depicting nudity or morphed photos within 24 hours of receiving a complaint.Significant social media companies — those with over 50 lakh users — also have to publish a monthly compliance report disclosing details of complaints received and action taken as also details of contents removed proactively.According to sources, the IT Ministry will soon release ‘Frequently Asked Questions’ (FAQs) around the intermediary guidelines to enable better understanding of the goals and provisions of the new rules among various stakeholders, including users.Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar is learnt to be spearheading the initiative on the proposed FAQs.The FAQs will drive the overall objective of ensuring that Indian internet is seen as safe for consumers and attractive for investments by investors, the sources added.Simply put, the FAQs would comprise questions that people ask about the rules, and are geared to make it easier for users to understand the norms around internet and social media in India. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-seeks-details-of-facebooks-algorithms-processes-amid-hate-speech-allegations-sources-330997

They were returning to their village in Punjab’s Mansa district after participating in the farmers’ protest at the Tikri border against the Centre’s agri laws.“Mother India—annadatas of the country (the food provider of the country) -- have been crushed. This cruelty and hatred are hollowing out our country. My condolences,” Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi using the hashtag ‘FarmersProtest’.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also slammed the BJP over the alleged problems being faced by the farmers.“There is no proper price for the crop when the farmer grows it by working hard. There is no fertilizer when the farmers prepare to grow the crop. Two farmers of Bundelkhand have died due to non-availability of fertilisers,” Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.She alleged that the BJP government has been unmoved by the problems of farmers and there was an “anti-farmer” attitude in both its intention and policy.Priyanka Gandhi also tagged with the tweet a video of a woman expressing problems faced by her in getting fertiliser.

28-10-2021||New Delhi||Centre releases full Rs 1.59 lakh crore to states this fiscal as back-to-back loan to compensate for GST shortfall||The Centre on Thursday released the balance Rs 44,000 crore to states as loan to compensate for the GST shortfall, taking the total such amount to Rs 1.59 lakh crore this fiscal.This release of funds as back-to-back loans is in addition to the bi-monthly GST compensation being given out of cess collection.The 43rd GST Council meeting on May 28, 2021, had decided that the Centre would borrow Rs 1.59 lakh crore in 2021-22 and release it to states and UTs with legislature on a back-to-back basis to meet the resource gap due to the shortfall in compensation on account of inadequate amount collected in the GST compensation fund.This amount is as per the principles adopted for a similar facility in the last fiscal 2020-21, where Rs 1.10 lakh crore was released to states.“The Ministry of Finance has released Rs 44,000 crore today to the states and UTs with legislature under the back-to-back loan facility in lieu of GST compensation,” the ministry said in a statement.The ministry had on July 15 and October 7 released Rs 75,000 crore and Rs 40,000 crore, respectively, to the states. With the release of Rs 44,000 crore on Thursday, the total amount released in the current financial year as back-to-back loan in-lieu of GST compensation is Rs 1.59 lakh crore, the statement added. This amount of Rs 1.59 lakh crore is over and above the compensation in excess of Rs 1 lakh crore (based on cess collection) that is estimated to be released to states/union territories with legislature during this financial year. “The sum total of Rs 2.59 lakh crore is expected to exceed the amount of GST compensation accruing in FY 2021-22,” the ministry added.The Rs 44,000 crore being released now is funded from the Government of India securities issued in the current financial year, at a Weighted Average Yield of 5.69 per cent. No additional market borrowing by the Central government is envisaged on account of this release.“It is expected that this release will help the states/UTs in planning their public expenditure among other things, for improving health infrastructure and taking up infrastructure projects,” it said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-releases-full-rs-1-59-lakh-crore-to-states-this-fiscal-as-back-to-back-loan-to-compensate-for-gst-shortfall-330977
28-10-2021||Vijay Mohan||Rajnath calls for long term strategy, tie up with academia to keep pace with fast changing defence technology||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 28Stating that the nature of today’s warfare is very dynamic and technology dominance in coming years will increase, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh called upon all stake holders, including scientists, armed forces and the industry, to keep an eye on evolving technologies and prepare a long term strategy to enhance indigenous capabilities.Addressing scientists at DRDO’s Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL) here after inaugurating the Augmented Environmental Test Facility for evaluating warheads and reviewing the laboratory’s technical infrastructure, he said technology in the present era is changing very fast. “By the time technology is developed and converted into a product, more advance technology emerges. This calls for introspection and formulating a long term strategy,” he said.Rajnath suggested that defence research and development organisations like TBRL should forge long term associations with academic institutions as this would enable scientists to work on core technical problems, create better technical employability and build a strong theoretical foundation. On the other hand, institutions will get the emphasis on conversion of research into actual products by moving from the theoretical analysis, which will be a win-win situation for both and will boost the defense ecosystem of the country, he said.Emphasising on the need to strengthen technology forecasting and invest in cutting edge manufacturing and testing capabilities, the defence minister said that increase in scientific capabilities and new inventions have made a big impact on security and stressed upon the need to be equipped and ready at all times to deal with any challenge arising out of the fast-changing geopolitical scenario around the world.Rajnath said many reforms have been undertaken by the government to increase the participation of the private sector in defence manufacturing. These include introduction of new provisions under Defence Acquisition Procedure 2020; DRDO’s initiative to involve the industry from the initial stages of development of systems, free of cost transfer of technology by DRDO and availability of its patents to the industry.Stating that there was a need to develop ‘Indian Standard’ in the defence manufacturing sector, Rajnath appreciated the fact that an Indian Standard has already been promulgated for the testing of bullet resistant jacket, with TBRL playing a key role in its manufacturing. “Indian Standards for design, development and methodology are being developed for other protective systems and gears. Test methodologies have been standardised for evaluation of anti-mine boots, mine protected vehicles and gears. Such Indian standards will certainly help the industry to not only benchmark the product against threats, but also help them compete with foreign manufacturers,” he added.The defence minister also listed out various other technologies developed by TBRL, including the multi-mode hand grenade, the first munition to be manufactured by the private sector and the upgraded bund blasting device, meant to destroy embankments and earthen defences that was handed over the Indian Army earlier this month.The defence minister and senior service officers were briefed about TBRL’s role, ongoing projects and future plans as well as technical and administrative aspects by the director, Prateek Kishore.Chief of Defence Staff, Gen Bipin Rawat, Chairman DRDO, Dr G Satheesh Reddy, Vice Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sandeep Singh, Director General Missiles and Strategic Systems (DRDO), Dr BHVS Narayana Murthy and Director General, Aeronautics (DRDO), Dr Tessy Thomas, were also present on the occasion.On the occasion, documents of the transfer of technology to manufacture the explosive warhead developed by TBRL for the Man-Portable Anti-Tank Guided Missile Mark-II were handed over to Economic Explosives Limited, Nagpur, a private firm.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajnath-calls-for-long-term-strategy-tie-up-with-academia-to-keep-pace-with-fast-changing-defence-technology-330974
28-10-2021||---||Govt extends nationwide containment measures till November 30||New Delhi, October 28The Centre on Thursday extended the nationwide Covid-19 containment measures till November 30 as there has been localised spread of the virus in a few states and the disease continues to be a public health challenge in the country.In a communication to chief secretaries of all states and union territories, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla also said existing protocols for curbing the spread of Covid-19 will continue till November 30.Last month, he had said there was a possibility that Covid-appropriate behaviour might not be adhered to strictly, especially during the festival season and hence it was critical to enforce guidelines which allowed regular festivities in a cautious, safe and Covid-appropriate manner.Bhalla had said the daily cases and overall number of patients in the country were declining steadily but there were localised spread of virus in a few states and Covid-19 continued to be a public health challenge in the country.The home secretary said states and union territories, on a regular basis, should closely monitor case positivity, hospital, ICU beds occupancy of every district falling under their jurisdiction.He said there should be continued focus on the five-fold strategy i.e. Test-Track-Treat-Vaccination and adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour, to safely navigate through the festive season to avoid the possibility of surge in Covid-19 cases.He said the state governments and union territory administrations should continue with their vaccination programmes with focus to accelerate inoculation of eligible age groups and prioritisation of second dose to eligible beneficiaries.The home secretary urged the chief secretaries to issue directions to the district and all other local authorities concerned, to take necessary measures as advised by union health ministry advisory for prompt and effective management of Covid-19.India’s total tally of Covid-19 cases rose to 3,42,31,809 with 16,156 more people testing positive, while the active cases declined to 1,60,989, the lowest in 243 days, according to Union health ministry data updated on Thursday.The death toll climbed to 4,56,386 with 733 fresh fatalities including 622 from Kerala, according to the data updated at 8 am.Of the 622 deaths in Kerala, 93 were reported in the last few days, 330 were those which were not confirmed until June 18 last year due to lack of adequate documentation and 199 were designated as Covid deaths after receiving appeals based on the new guidelines of the Centre and Supreme Court directions, a state government release said.The health ministry said the daily rise in new coronavirus infections has been below 30,000 for 34 straight days and less than 50,000 daily new cases have been reported for 123 consecutive days now.

28-10-2021||Pune||Warfare areas have shifted from territorial frontier to civil society: Ajit Doval||National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on Thursday said the new areas of warfare had shifted from territorial frontiers to civil societies, adding that factors like people’s health, their sense of well-being and security, and their perception of government impacted the will of a nation.Speaking on ‘National Security Preparedness in the Age of Disasters and Pandemics’, at the Pune Dialogue on National Security organised by Pune International Centre here, Doval said disasters and pandemics could not be tackled in isolation."You are all aware of the changes taking place in the global security landscape. Wars are increasingly becoming cost ineffective instruments of achieving the nation's political and military objectives."The new areas of warfare have shifted from merely territorial frontiers to the civil societies. The common people's thinking, their perception, health, sense of well-being and their perception of their government have assumed new importance," Doval said. All these elements cumulatively impacted the will of the nation, he added.Protecting people from false and motivated propaganda also becomes “absolutely necessary” in the age of information revolution, Doval said. National security planning needs to factor in all these challenges and strategies to maximum international cooperation, he added.The coronavirus pandemic and devastating natural disasters have the potential to impact the collective psyche of the people, their economic well-being, and instil fears about their survival, Doval said.“It generates social imbalance that can threaten the political stability, economic growth, and even the capacity of a nation to resolutely meet its external and internal threats," he said.These new genres of security threats present multi-level dilemma on a massive scale, he said. At the micro-level, they include saving individual lives, providing medical care and supporting people, ensuring the supplies of food and essential commodities, and maintaining law and order, he added.The issues include finding effective preventive and curative medicines and administering them to combat the ever-evolving new strains of viruses, and ensuring smooth supply chains, he said.

The officer is facing the departmental vigilance probe.State minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik had levelled a string of allegations against the NCB official, including illegal phone tapping.He had also alleged Sameer Wankhede was born as a Muslim, but forged documents, including a caste certificate, to show that he belonged to the Hindu SC category to get a job under quota after clearing the UPSC examination.In her letter to the CM, the NCB official's wife, said, "Being a Marathi person, I expect some justice from your side as my personal life is unnecessarily being dragged into a controversy. Had late Balasaheb Thackeray (father of Uddhav Thackeray) been alive today, he would not have tolerated such personal attack on a woman's dignity.”"I see you as the torch-bearer of his teachings and leadership. The dignity of a woman has become a joke in the regime that draws inspiration from the tenure of 17th century king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,” she said.Kranti Redkar, who is a Marathi actress, further said she is an artist and does not understand politics and is not interested in it.“The personal attacks reflect the lowest level of politics. I trust you and feel that there will be no injustice against me or my family,” she said in her letter to the CM. On Wednesday, she had said her husband was born as Hindu and he never changed his religion. She had also contested the claim made by the Qazi, who performed the first marriage of Sameer Wankhede in 2006, that he was Muslim at the time of the 'nikah'. Kranti Redkar, who married Sameer Wankhede in 2017, had also slammed Malik for playing "low level" politics by making various allegations against her husband.

They're concerned about the intersection between instability there and their counterterrorism concerns," Colin H Kahl, Under Secretary of Defence for Policy, told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee during a hearing on Afghanistan, South and Central Asia Security."They (Indians) want to work with us on those issues, sharing intelligence, cooperating where we can," he said, adding that there is a tremendous convergence between US and Indian national interests right now."It provides a lot of opportunity for us to cooperate with India, not just on Afghanistan and counterterrorism, but on broader regional security questions, in the Indian Ocean and as it relates to the broader Indo-Pacific," Kahl said.He was responding to a question from Senator Gary Peters."India's policies towards Afghanistan have been conceived largely through the lens of competition and proxy conflict with Pakistan. So it stands to reason that New Delhi should be no less concerned about the possibility that a Taliban government could benefit anti-Indian terrorist groups, especially those oriented towards Kashmir," he said."In view of our commitment to joint cooperation with this critical partner, and the fact that India is the only designated major defence partner of the United States, I believe it's important for us to understand how its view towards Afghanistan has and will evolve," Peters said.

Way back in 2019 during his US visit, the minister had said, “I am reasonably convinced of the powers of my persuasion.

The “Land Boundary Law”, among other things, states that China abides by treaties concluded with or jointly acceded to by foreign countries on land boundary affairs. It also has provisions to carry out re-organisation of districts in the border areas. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinas-new-boundary-law-has-india-worried-330531
28-10-2021||---||Right to privacy sacrosanct, says Supreme Court; retired judge to head Pegasus probe||New Delhi, October 27Noting that the right to privacy is sacrosanct, though not absolute, the Supreme Court today set up an independent expert committee led by former top court judge RV Raveendran to look into the allegations of snooping on journalists, activists, politicians, etc. using Pegasus spyware.No omnibus bar against judicial reviewNational security can’t be the bugbear that the judiciary shies away from... Although this court should be circumspect in encroaching upon the domain of national security, no omnibus prohibition can be called for against judicial review.A Bench led by Chief Justice NV Ramana said Justice Raveendran would be assisted by former IPS officer Alok Joshi and Dr Sundeep Oberoi, Chairman, Sub-Committee (International Organisation of Standardisation/International Electro-Technical Commission/Joint Technical Committee), in overseeing the work of a three-member technical committee. The members of the technical committee are Naveen Kumar Chaudhary, Professor (cyber security and digital forensics) and Dean, National Forensic Sciences University, Gandhinagar; Dr Prabaharan P, Professor (School of Engineering), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri, Kerala; and Dr Ashwin Anil Gumaste, Institute Chair Associate Professor (computer science and engineering), IIT, Bombay.Asking the panel to expeditiously probe the issue and submit a report to it, the Bench posted the matter for hearing after eight weeks.The court also turned down the Centre’s offer of setting up an expert panel to look into the allegations, saying, “Rather than relying upon any government agencies, we have constituted the committee and shortlisted expert members based on biodatas and information collected independently.” It also rejected Solicitor General Tushar Mehta’s arguement that the petitions and media reports were motivated, saying such omnibus oral submissions can’t be accepted. “Privacy is not the singular concern of journalists or social activists. Every citizen of India ought to be protected against violations of privacy,” said the Bench, which also included Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli.Admitting that the scope of judicial review was limited on issues of national security, the Bench said, “However, this does not mean that the state gets a free pass every time the spectre of ‘national security’ is raised. National security cannot be the bugbear that the judiciary shies away from, by virtue of its mere mentioning. Although this Court should be circumspect in encroaching upon the domain of national security, no omnibus prohibition can be called for against judicial review.” Pointing out that there had been no specific denial of snooping by the Centre, the top court said it had no option but to accept the petitioners’ submissions and appoint an expert committee.Noting that there were restrictions on right to privacy, the Bench said the restrictions had to withstand constitutional scrutiny. “In today’s world, restrictions on privacy are to prevent terrorist activities and can only be imposed when needed to protect national security,” it added.Referring to KS Puttaswamy vs Union of India (2017) case – in which right to privacy was declared a fundamental right – the top court said the verdict has recognised that “the right to privacy is as sacrosanct as human existence and is inalienable to human dignity and autonomy”.However, the Bench clarified, “Although declared to be inalienable, the right to privacy, of course, cannot be said to be absolute, as the Constitution does not provide for such a right without reasonable restrictions.”Compelling circumstances behind orderCommittee’s terms of reference||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/right-to-privacy-sacrosanct-says-supreme-court-retired-judge-to-head-pegasus-probe-330535
28-10-2021||---||India expresses concern over China’s new boundary law||New Delhi, October 27India has expressed concern over China’s Land Boundary Law passed on October 23.“China’s unilateral decision to bring about legislation which can have implications on our existing bilateral arrangements on border management as well as on the boundary question is of concern to us,” said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.The passage of this new law does not confer any legitimacy to the so-called China-Pakistan “Boundary Agreement” of 1963 which India has consistently maintained is an illegal and invalid agreement, he added.Analysts believe this law which entrusts the border area responsibility to the People’s Liberation Army from January 1 would make any Indian attempts to persuade a pull back in eastern Ladakh difficult.Such unilateral move will have no bearing on the arrangements that both sides have already reached earlier, whether it is on the Boundary Question or for maintaining peace and tranquillity along the LAC in India-China Border areas. “We also expect that China will avoid undertaking action under the pretext of this law which could unilaterally alter the situation in the India-China border areas,” observed Bagchi.The new “Land Boundary Law” passed by China on October 23, among other things, states that China abides by treaties concluded with or jointly acceded to by foreign countries on land boundary affairs. It also has provisions to carry out reorganisation of districts in the border areas.“It may be noted that India and China have still not resolved the boundary question,” Bagchi pointed out. Both sides have agreed to seek a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable resolution to the Boundary Question through consultations on an equal footing. Both sides have also concluded several bilateral agreements, protocols and arrangements to maintain peace and tranquility along the LAC in India-China border areas in the interim, he reminded the Chinese side.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-expresses-concern-over-chinas-new-boundary-law-330472
28-10-2021||Vijay Mohan||AFT sets aside order to try Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel by court martial for financial misappropriation||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 27The Armed Forces Tribunal has set aside the army’s orders for the re-assembly of a summary general court martial (SGCM) of a Colonel and a Lieutenant Colonel who were facing charges of alleged financial misappropriation.A joint trial was convened at Akhnoor in 2020 to try the officers, where they had raised a special plea to jurisdiction on the grounds of procedural irregularities, averring that they had been denied adequate opportunity not defend themselves.The SGCM had accepted their plea of jurisdiction after observing that the mandatory Army Rule 22, which allows an accused person to examine defence witnesses, was not complied with during initial proceedings and referred its decision to the convening authority for confirmation.The convening authority, in this case the General Officer Commanding, 10 Infantry Division, did not agree with the findings of the SGCM directed that the court martial re-assemble on July 1, 2021 for re-examining its decision on the special plea of jurisdiction raised by both the officers.Thereafter the officers moved the AFT challenging the re-assembly order. “The Tribunal’s Principal Bench, in its order today, has set aside the order after observing that mandatory pre-trial proceedings were not complied with by the Army,” Col Indra Sen Singh (retd), counsel for one of the officers said. “The Bench held that the officers did not get adequate opportunity to defend themselves and in the given circumstances, they now cannot be tried further by this SGCM,” he added.One of the accused officers, a Colonel, was the commanding officer of an Electronics and Mechanical Engineers’ (EME) battalion in the northern sector, while the other, a Lieutenant Colonel, was commanding one of the battalion’s field workshop.The alleged irregularities came to light during the handing over -- taking over process on change of command. The matter was reported to higher authorities, following which a court of inquiry (COI) was ordered in 2017 to investigate the lapses. Both officers were posted out within a few days of each other, sources said. They were later attached back, along with the unit’s Subedar Major, for disciplinary action.An EME battalion receives technical grants for maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment, including IT hardware and paraphernalia. During the COI, it was brought out that bookings for equipment and work amounting to about Rs 40 lakh had been made by the Colonel against this grant while similar books amounting to Rs 17 lakh had been made by the Lieutenant Colonel. The equipment was not received in the battalion.In addition, the Lieutenant Colonel had also been charged with siphoning Rs 1.86 lakh from the condiment allowance meant for troops, while the Colonel has been charged for failure of command and control for inability on his part to detect and prevent this.Further, the officers were also involved in surreptitiously felling about 200 trees in unit area and selling them. They were charged under Sections 52(b) and Sector 63 of the Army Act for intent to defraud and acts prejudicial to good order and military discipline.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aft-sets-aside-order-to-try-colonel-lieutenant-colonel-by-court-martial-for-financial-misappropriation-330456
28-10-2021||Mumbai||Cruise drugs case: Bombay HC to continue hearing Aryan Khan's bail plea on Thursday||The Narcotics Control Bureau spoke about Aryan Khan, Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son, and others of being accused of a conspiracy, but it never pressed that charge officially following their arrest in a drugs case, their lawyer told the Bombay High Court during bail hearing on Wednesday.The hearing on bail applications of Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha before Justice NW Sambre remained incomplete on the second day.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, representing the Narcotics Control Bureau, would be making arguments on Thursday.Khan (23) and other two are in jail since October 3 after the NCB raided a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast and allegedly recovered narcotic drugs.“Tomorrow we will try to finish it,” Justice Sambre said after Wednesday’s hearing which went on for over two hours.Senior advocate Mukul  Rohatgi, appearing for Aryan Khan, argued that the arrest was a direct infringement of constitutional provisions as the arrest memo did not give the “true and correct grounds”.Senior counsel Amit Desai, appearing for Merchant, pointed out that the special court for Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on Tuesday granted bail to two other accused in the case—Manish Rajgaria and Avin Sahu.“The allegations against them are also the same. In fact there was recovery of 2.6 grams of ganja (cannabis) from one of the accused and the second had said that he had consumed,” Desai said.“If not on (the ground of) parity but on liberty these boys (Aryan Khan and Merchant) should be granted bail...Release them on bail with strict conditions,” Desai argued.He further told the court that the charge of conspiracy and abetment was invoked in the case by the NCB as an afterthought.Instead of arresting them, the NCB should have first issued them a notice under section 41A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (under which an accused is asked to appear and record a statement in minor offenses), the lawyer said.“What was the need to arrest them at that time when conspiracy charge was not even applied,” Desai said, adding that the charge of possession of small quantity of drugs only attracts one year’s imprisonment, so it was a minor offense.The NCB’s arrest memo of October 3 contained only sections 20(B) and 27 of the NDPS Act which relate to consumption and possession of drugs, and   “there is no mention of sections 28 and 29 pertaining to abetment and conspiracy,” advocate Desai said.“So as per the NCB’s assessment of material based on recovery at that time...these three individuals were doing individual acts of consumption and possession,” Desai said, claiming further that to date the charge of conspiracy has not been officially invoked against the trio.“The magistrate on October 3 was misled by the NCB to believe that conspiracy charge was also invoked while seeking their remand,” he said.Merchant’s alleged statement that he had on him six grams of charas for consumption along with Aryan was inadmissible as evidence, and the NCB never sent them for medical examination, the lawyer said.The high court asked if there was any connection between the two co-accused who have got bail, and Aryan Khan and Merchant. Desai said there was absolutely no connection.“There are no WhatsApp chats between these three accused with the other accused. The WhatsApp chats being relied upon by the NCB are old and have no connection with this case,” the lawyer added.These alleged WhatsApp chats of Aryan and others were provided to the media but were not part of court records, he said, questioning their veracity.Justice Sambre said the United Kingdom has done away with the need to supply a certificate to prove the authenticity of electronic evidence, but the same is needed in India.Advocate Kaashif Ali Khan Deshmukh,  appearing for Dhamecha, said she was made a scapegoat only because she was detained with Aryan and Merchant.“The NCB has made Dhamecha a part of the alleged drug network. She doesn’t even know these persons (Aryan and Merchant). She comes from a small town in Madhya Pradesh and is a fashion model,” he said.Dhamecha never consumed drugs and a medical examination can confirm it, her lawyer added.Aryan Khan, Merchant and Dhamecha moved the high court last week after the special NDPS Act court rejected their bail applications. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cruise-drugs-case-bombay-hc-to-continue-hearing-aryan-khans-bail-plea-on-thursday-330421

28-10-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court sets up expert panel led by retired judge to probe Pegasus row||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 27Noting that citizens need to be protected from violation of privacy, the Supreme Court on Wednesday set up an independent expert committee led by former top court judge RV Raveendran to look into allegations of snooping on journalists, activists, politicians, etc, using the Israeli Pegasus spyware.A Bench led by Chief Justice NV Ramana said Justice Raveendran would be assisted by former IPS officer Alok Joshi and Dr Sundeep Oberoi, Chairman, Sub Committee in (International Organisation of Standardisation/International Electro-Technical Commission/Joint Technical Committee) in supervising the work of a three-member technical committee.The members of the technical committee are Naveen Kumar Chaudhary, Professor (Cyber Security and Digital Forensics) and Dean, National Forensic Sciences University, Gandhinagar, Dr Prabaharan P, Prof (School of Engineering), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri, Kerala, and Dr Ashwin Anil Gumaste, Institute Chair Associate Professor (Computer Science and Engineering), IIT, Bombay.The top court asked the panel to expeditiously probe the issue and posted the matter for hearing after eight weeks.“It was an uphill task to choose independent members; we have selected this based on data gathered personally,” the CJI said.Noting that it had chosen renowned experts in cyber security and forensics to be a part of this committee, the top court said the terms of reference were detailed in the order.“Members of a democratic society have reasonable concerns about privacy. Citizens need to be protected from violation of privacy,” said the Bench, which also included Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli.Noting that there’s serious concern of a foreign agency’s involvement in surveillance on Indians, it said such a committee was needed to discover the truth as violation of right to privacy was needed to be examined in view of the Centre’s refusal to take a clear stand.Quoting George Orwell (‘1984’), the CJI said, "If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.”The CJI said, “The state cannot get a free pass every time by raising national security concerns. No omnibus prohibition can be called against judicial review. The Centre should have justified its stand here and not render the court a mute spectator.”Pointing out that there had been no specific denial of snooping by the Centre, the top court said, “We have no option but to accept the submissions of petitioner prima facie and thus we appoint an expert committee whose function will be overseen by the Supreme Court.”Taking note of the fact that some of the petitioners had claimed to be direct victims of Pegasus snooping, the Bench said, “We live in the era of information…We must recognise that while technology is important, it’s important to safeguard right to privacy…Not only for journalists but privacy is important for all citizens…It’s incumbent upon the Centre to seriously consider the use of such a technology.”The Bench said it gave ample time to the Centre to disclose all information regarding the Pegasus scandal since 2019 but the latter chose to file only a limited affidavit throwing no light. Had the Centre made its stand clear, the burden on the court would have been less, it added.Earlier, the Centre wanted to set up an expert panel to look into the snooping scandal.Maintaining that surveillance affects the right and freedom of people, the Bench said it’s also about freedom of press and the role played by them and use of such technology may have a chilling effect on the right of the press.The Bench – which was initially not satisfied with the petitioners’ contentions based on newspaper reports – said it usually discouraged PILs based on media reports. However, it said there were several petitions filed by direct victims of snooping.It turned down Solicitor General Tushar Mehta’s submission that the petitions and media reports were motivated, saying such omnibus oral submissions can’t be accepted.Noting that there were restrictions on right to privacy, the Bench said the restrictions had to withstand constitutional scrutiny. “In today's world, restrictions on privacy are to prevent terrorist activities and can only be imposed when needed to protect national security,” it added.The order was delayed as several experts had expressed unwillingness to be part of the expert committee.An international media consortium had reported that over 300 verified Indian mobile phone numbers were on the list of potential targets for surveillance using Pegasus spyware. It was also reported that phones of a former judge of the Supreme Court and its registrars were allegedly intercepted using the spyware.Around 10 petitioners, including the Editors Guild of India and senior journalists N Ram and others, have sought an independent probe into the alleged snooping on eminent citizens, politicians and scribes by using Israeli firm NSO's spyware Pegasus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-sets-up-expert-panel-led-by-retired-judge-to-probe-pegasus-row-330344
