KCR clarified his party’s position at a joint address to the TRS Parliamentary Party and the Legislative Party members in Hyderabad today.The TRS government is completed half its term so far. Many promises made during the previous elections in November 2018 had been fulfilled, while there were still others to be worked up. So, there was no question of going in for polls before all promises made to the people had been fulfilled.Party working president KT Rama Rao, a state minister and son of the chief minister, has been made in charge of the party’s celebrations to mark two decades of TRS coming into being. Buses and other vehicles in large numbers will be arranged to ferry participants to the meet to celebrate the occasion at a function being held at Warangal.Given the still prevailing Covid-19 situation, the party has decided to reduce the number of the audience attending the TRS plenary from 14,000 to 6,000.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cm-dispels-rumours-of-an-early-poll-in-telangana-325831

PM Modi had last month released a commemorative coin stamp on his 125th birth anniversary.Bangladesh media reported the rape of a Hindu family that led to the death of a girl-child, raising the death toll to about 20.Bangladesh Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said the Comilla incident, in which several Hindu temples were simultaneously attacked, was planned. “The people of Bangladesh are religious but not fanatic. We never allowed militancy and terrorism on the soil of Bangladesh. We contained militancy and terrorism through united efforts,” he said.“No incident has been reported since Saturday night. Our security forces are working with patience. Those who are trying to destroy communal peace will not succeed,” assured the Minister.However, it now transpires that the attacks have been going on for nearly a month. On September 22, Hindu organisations reported the defacing of the idols being prepared for the festival. In the latest bout of violence and vandalism, the attacks had started about a week back but were reported and noticed after they gathered intensity from Thursday. For instance, on October 11, mobs stopped a puja at the Sankhannidhi Temple in Dhaka and on the same day, an attack took place as the Durga idol was being taken into the puja mandapa in Kotwali, Chittagong.Seven months back, a dozen people were killed, properties ransacked and a temple set on fire in protest against PM Modi’s visit to Bangladesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bangladesh-settles-into-uneasy-calm-as-isckon-seeks-pm-modis-intervention-325827
17-10-2021||New Delhi||Lakhimpur incident: SKM to hold ‘Rail Roko’ on Monday to demand dismissal, arrest of Union Minister||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Sunday said ‘Rail Roko’ protests will be held across the country on October 18 to demand the dismissal and arrest Union Minister Ajay Mishra in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident.In a statement, the umbrella body of farmer unions spearheading the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s three agri laws, said “protests will only be intensified until justice is secured” in the Lakhimpur Kheri case.The SKM said during the ‘rail roko’ protest, all train traffic will be stopped for six hours from 10 am till 4 pm on Monday.“To press for its demand for MoS Home Ajay Mishra’s dismissal and arrest, so that justice can be secured in the Lakhimpur Kheri massacre, Samyukt Kisan Morcha has announced a nation-wide Rail Roko program tomorrow.“SKM put out a call to its constituents to stop rail traffic for six hours on October 18, between 10 am and 4 pm. The SKM asks for this action to be taken up peacefully, without any destruction and damage of any kind to any railway property,” it said.Four of the eight people who died in the violence on October 3 were farmers, allegedly knocked down by a vehicle carrying BJP workers. Angry farmers then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles.The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver.Farmers have claimed that Ashish Mishra was in one of the vehicles, an allegation denied by him and Ajay Mishra who say they can produce evidence to prove he was at an event at that time.Ashish Mishra was arrested in the case on October 9.The SKM also claimed that at effigy-burning events across Uttar Pradesh, several farmer leaders were put under house arrested while some were detained.SKM condemns this and asks the UP government not to suppress the right to protest of ordinary citizens, it added.

In such a situation, all the technical aspects and state-of-the-art technology are being considered regarding how the rays of the sun reach the sanctum (of Ram temple)”.The member said a committee consisting of experts from the National Institute of Building Construction, including Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, IIT Mumbai, and IIT Roorkee, has been formed to focus on the technical aspects related to the construction of the temple.Another senior official of the trust said, “The construction work of Shri Ram temple is going on at a fast pace. Efforts are being made (to ensure) that by December 2023, the construction of the sanctum sanctorum should be completed and people can have darshan.”         He informed that the first phase of foundation has been completed, while the second phase will be over by mid-November.During the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya, several aspects, including geological, geographical and ecological conditions, are being taken into consideration, he said.Chaupal said according to the geological classification, Uttar Pradesh is prone to earthquakes and there is a river near the temple complex while the entire area comes under the Himalayan region.“From November 15, the work of construction of the plinth (the base part of the pillar) will also start. The construction of pillars and overhead structure on the plinth is expected to start from April 2022,” he said.Some changes have been made in the earlier model regarding the construction of the temple, Chaupal said, adding that three floors would be constructed now instead of the two planned initially.Chaupal informed that the temple will have a museum, archives room, research centre, auditorium, gaushala, tourist centre, administrative building, yoga centre and other facilities. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sun-rays-to-illuminate-sanctum-sanctorum-of-ram-temple-in-ayodhya-trust-member-325818
17-10-2021||New Delhi||Road safety: IIT researchers working on first-of-its-kind geography based smart speed warning system||Researchers at different Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are working on development of a first-of-its-kind “smart speed warning system” for vehicles which will alert the driver on the basis of road infrastructure and geographical location to avoid over-speeding related crashes.According to statistics available with the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, about 70 per cent of road fatalities in India occur due to over-speeding.To minimise such fatalities, the government had mandated that all new cars sold from July 1, 2019, should include a speed governor device that will generate intermittent warning beeps for above 80 kmph and the constant beep for above 120 kmph for drivers. To further reduce damage to lives, the fine for speeding was increased by ten times under the new Motor Vehicles Act of 2019.However, the researchers at IIT Guwahati and Bombay believe the current speed governing device is a “one size fits all” solution and does not have much intelligence and the same system cannot effectively work while driving in hilly terrains, plains or desert areas.“Our studies revealed the safe speed for a vehicle can significantly vary with changes in road geometry like on sharp or blind curves or hairpin bends. Therefore, there is a need to develop a smart speed warning system incorporating a dynamic and adaptable speed threshold based on upcoming road infrastructure to avoid overspeeding-related crashes,” Akhilesh Kumar Maurya, Civil Engineering Professor at IIT Guwahati, told PTI.“Traditional warning systems are based on the fixed speed threshold, however, the concept of a smart warning system is based on upcoming road infrastructure and vehicle location. On approaching curves along a roadway, including blind curves or hairpin bends, vehicles equipped with such a system will warn drivers in advance, which will allow drivers to adopt corrective actions and avoid accidents,” he added.The researchers, who are in process of filing a patent for the system, claim that such a system is not available anywhere across the globe.According to the team, algorithm for the smart speed warning system was developed based on the field data collected from a 45 km stretch of four-lane highway (NH-40) between Jorabat in Assam and Nongpoh in Meghalaya, consisting of 285 horizontal curves. The study section covered a broader range of road geometry (curve radius ranges from 20-800m, curve length varies from 30-244 m and gradient varied from seven per cent to nine per cent.“We are in the process of analysing data of two-lane undivided highway NH-61 between Mumbai and Malshej Ghat in Maharashtra. We have now completed our pilot studies along four-lane divided highway, NH-160 between Thane and Nashik (Maharashtra) and now planning to collect detailed data very soon,” Maurya said.The team plans to conduct similar pilot studies at different highways across the country to get an idea of different geographical locations and present the model ultimately to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).During the pilot studies of speed prediction model development, the researchers came up with car speed model and HCV and LCV speed model.According to Avijit Maji, Associate Professor at IIT Bombay’s Civil Engineering department, researchers have used operating speed of vehicles as one of the surrogate measures for safety evaluation of horizontal curves.“Now, the 85th percentile speed of vehicles in free-flow condition is widely considered as the operating speed. However, the geometric features of highways are designed on the basis of design speed. Some studies pointed out that the design speed might be represented by 95th to 98th percentile speed of vehicles in free-flow condition,” he described in a paper published in the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) journal.“Drivers in developing nations are not well disciplined and often drive solely based on their perception of the road geometry. Hence, the 98th percentile vehicle speed can be useful in evaluating safety of a highway section in such country. Now, the available vehicle speed prediction models vary widely. Differences in driver behaviour and highway geometry might be the reasons for these variations,” he added.Another research scholar from the team asserted that studies show that the decision-making process and driver performance greatly depends on situational awareness.“Drivers intend to operate vehicles at safe speed based on the roadway geometric features. These features are characterised by gradient, horizontal curvature, length of curves and tangent sections, superelevation, etc. Perceptive and consistent geometric characteristics of the roadway can ease the decision making burden and thus minimise driver error.“So far, majority of the studies on geometric design consistency are conducted on isolated curve sections in plain terrain for traffic with strong lane discipline. The effect of gradient is not significant in these terrains. Further, the driving behaviour of traffic with weak lane discipline is not represented in these studies,” he described.

17-10-2021||Lucknow||BJP needs yogya government not Yogi government: Akhilesh||Samajwadi Party president and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday attacked the BJP dispensation, saying the state needs a ‘yogya’ (competent) government and not a Yogi government.Speaking to reporters at the party’s headquarters here, he further alleged the BJP “has no work to do” aside from changing names.“It believes in filling pockets instead of potholes. Uttar Pradesh needs a ‘yogya’ (competent) government and not a Yogi government,” he said.He was speaking after former Uttar Pradesh chief of Bahujan Samaj Party RS Kushwaha and former MP Kadir Rana joined the SP.Yadav reiterated his party’s demand for a caste census, and said that when the Congress was in power at the Centre, Netaji (Mulayam Singh Yadav), RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and Sharad Yadav had demanded that a caste census was done.The SP chief also attacked the BJP government over rising prices of petrol, diesel and LPG.“At a number of places, the price of petrol has crossed Rs 100 per litre, and the public is forced to buy everything at a higher price. The prices of diesel and LPG cylinders have also increased. Do they have any answer to this?” he said.He also attacked the BJP over Samajwadi Party MLA Nitin Agarwal filing nomination for the deputy speaker’s post in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly with the support of the ruling party.“Which party does the candidate put up by the BJP belong to? What can be expected of a government which inaugurates already inaugurated projects, and lays foundation stone of the projects, for which the foundation stone has already been laid?” he asked.He also rubbished claims of factionalism in the Samajwadi Party and claimed the BJP will not give tickets to 150 MLAs in the 2022 polls.Yadav had earlier said that SP will win 400 out of the 403 seats in the UP Assembly. He termed the BJP government “anti-farmer”.“Both the UP government and the Centre have deceived (people). The truth is that no one has got a job,” Yadav said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-needs-yogya-government-not-yogi-government-akhilesh-325810

Since then, the site has added several more attractions for the visitors, such as theme-based gardens, jungle safari, children nutrition park, river rafting, night tourism, among others.In March this year, the Statue of Unity crossed the 50-lakh tourists’ mark in just a little more than two years of its opening. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/statue-of-unity-to-remain-shut-for-visitors-from-oct-28-to-nov-1-for-national-unity-day-celebration-325805

17-10-2021||New Delhi||Govt will decide on Covid vaccination of children, adolescents on ‘scientific rationale’, supply situation: V K Paul||The government will take a final decision on vaccinating children and adolescents against coronavirus on the basis of overall scientific rationale as well as the supply situation of vaccines available for those below 18 years old, Covid Task Force chief V K Paul said on Sunday.Paul, who has been playing a key role in the government’s efforts in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also cautioned that even though infections are coming down and the second wave is subsiding, it will not be fair now to say that the worst is over since many countries have seen more than two waves.Currently, three vaccines—Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V—being administered in the country are only for those above 18 years of age. All of them are two-dose vaccines.Zydus Cadila’s indigenously developed needle-free Covid-19 vaccine ZyCoV-D is set to become the first vaccine that will be available in India for those in the age group of 12-18 years. It has received Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).“We do know that several countries have introduced vaccination for adolescents (people) and children. We will take a final decision based on the overall scientific rationale and the supply situation of the child licenced vaccines, going forward,” Paul told PTI in an interview.An expert panel of India’s central drug authority has recommended granting EUA to Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for children and adolescents in the 2-18 years age group with certain conditions.If approved by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI), it will be the second vaccine after ZyCoV-D to get EUA for use among those below 18 years.The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) is looking at how ZyCov-D should be positioned for most optimum use.According to Paul, Covaxin is a part of the adult vaccination programme and how to provision the vaccine, if at all for children, has to be also examined in the totality of the requirements of the vaccination programme.“A pragmatic decision (on vaccination of children and adolescents) can be taken (only) by balancing the supply and the potential eligibility,” he said.While noting it will not be possible now to give a particular timeline on when Covid vaccination will start for children, Paul said, “The preparation for incorporation of Zydus Cadila’s vaccine into the vaccination programme is proceeding well, training is already being held. NTAGI advice for the best use of the vaccine is explored. So soon, this will be rolled out”.According to Paul, children are part and parcel of the chains of Covid transmission and are infected in large numbers. At the same time, Covid infections in children are very mild or asymptomatic, and that is one side of the story.On the other side, he said that once there is enough vaccine available that can be used in children, “so why not protect them”.Schools have reopened in many states, mainly for higher classes.When asked whether the worst of the pandemic is over, Paul said, “It is reassuring that the number of COVID cases are now on the decline and the second wave is now subsiding but to say that the worst is over will not be fair because we have seen in other nations, there have been more than two waves”.Cautioning that the country is passing through a phase when there are festivals and potential gatherings, he said this is a critical phase as the virus can spread again.“We have seen that even in other countries where vaccine coverage is good, the escalation in the pandemic can happen and has happened.“Therefore, certainly we should not assume that this situation of the declining trend will continue and definitely we should not think that the worst is over, we have to be ever watchful,” he emphasised.While stressing that the vaccination programme has picked up huge speed, Paul also said that states which are for whatever reasons lagging behind must work hard and must push vaccination.“Now, of course, there is no dearth, no inadequacy of vaccine supply. They are as of today 10 crore doses of vaccines with the state governments for the vaccination programme,” he said.As the supply situation is excellent, Paul said the states must ensure that they reach out to those who are left out in the vaccination programme.“Given the present generous vaccine supply situation and the performance of the vaccine implementation programme, it is well within our grasp to accomplish universal vaccination of the adult population,” he asserted.On some reports that India simply will not have enough syringes for Covid vaccines if every single adult is to be fully vaccinated by the end of the year, Paul said, “there is no problem of syringe availability, we are in a good shape”.The country recorded 14,146 fresh Covid infections in a day while active cases declined to 1,95,846, the lowest in 220 days, according to the Union Health Ministry’s data released on Sunday.

17-10-2021||New Delhi||Govt yet to decide on 12 names reiterated by SC Collegium for appointment as judges||The government is yet to decide on 12 names reiterated by the Supreme Court collegium between March and September this year for appointment as judges in four high courts, sources aware of the procedure of appointment in the higher judiciary have said.On different occasions, the government had returned these names to the Supreme Court Collegium with a request to reconsider its recommendations to elevate these people as judges of high courts.While five names are for the Calcutta High Court, three are for the Jammu and Kashmir HC. Two names each are for Karnataka and Allahabad high courts.Between March and September this year, the Supreme Court Collegium had reiterated to the government its recommendations to appoint these 12 candidates as high court judges, the sources said.While HC judges are being appointed from the list of fresh recommendations made by the SC Collegium, the government is yet to take a call on the names reiterated by the three-member body headed by the chief justice of India, they said.As per the established procedure, high court collegiums send names of candidates they deem fit to be appointed as HC judges, to the Law Ministry. The ministry, in turn, attaches IB reports about the candidates and other details, before forwarding them to the Supreme Court Collegium.The apex court Collegium then processes these names and recommends some to the government for elevation as HC judges.The 12 names were recommended by the respective HC collegiums two to four years ago.On Saturday, seven advocates were appointed as judges of the Gujarat High Court, in a fresh set of appointments to the higher judiciary.On October 14, seven judges, including four advocates, were appointed to three high courts.A total of 14 new judges were on Wednesday appointed to three high courts, a day after a record 17 appointments across three other high courts.On October 11, three advocates and two judicial officers were elevated as judges of the Rajasthan High Court.On October 9, eight judges were elevated as chief justices of high courts and five high court chief justices were transferred based on recommendations made by the Supreme Court collegium.In a separate development, seven judges were on October 11 transferred to different high courts.On October 5, as many as 15 judges of 11 high courts were transferred.

17-10-2021||Mumbai||‘Government killings’ have replaced ‘contract killings’ with the help of Central agencies: Sanjay Raut||Launching a stinging attack on the BJP and the Centre over the alleged misuse of investigative agencies, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday alleged that “contract killings” are now replaced by “government killings” to finish off political rivals in Maharashtra.With some ministers in the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Government under the scanner of the Enforcement Directorate (ED), income tax, and at least one of them facing a CBI inquiry, Raut said that Central investigating agencies are working as “contract killers for the party in power in Delhi”.“Is there a rule of law or (a rule of) raids in Maharashtra? This is the question which comes to one’s mind considering the record-break raids being conducted through Central investigating agencies,” Raut wrote in the weekly column ‘Rokhthok’ in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ of which he is the executive editor.Earlier, Delhi rulers used to lie but now (ordering) frequent raids have become a new business without any capital investment, he stated. “Use people’s money, government machinery to remove political opponents. In the past, contract killings were the order of the day in Mumbai (when Underworld was active). Hitmen were hired on contract to kill rivals (by gangs). This is now replaced by ‘government killing’. Central investigating agencies are working as contract killers for the party in power in Delhi,” Raut said.Finishing off the unwanted political rivals through these agencies seems to have become a new policy, Raut stated.Referring to the arrest of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and state minister Nawab Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Raut said Khan had been arrested under the pretext of his involvement in a drug racket and was put in jail for eight months.“Now the court has granted him bail. The court said herbal tobacco was found in the possession of Khan and not drugs. Malik should file cases against NCB officials,” Raut said in the write-up.The Sena leader further said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was raiding homes of former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh instead of finding out the whereabouts of Param Bir Singh, the former commissioner of Mumbai police who had accused Deshmukh of corruption with the help of some police officers when he was serving as the home minister of the state.Raut also slammed the raids conducted recently by the Income Tax department on the family members of NCP leader and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.The details of the PM Cares Fund are not made public. It is said this fund is not a government fund but a private fund. Funds worth crores of rupees are collected in the name of the prime Minister,” Raut stated.

His funeral will be conducted at his ancestral village Chadi in the Osian subdivision of Jodhpur,” Prakash said.A Public Health Engineering Minister in the 2008-2013 Ashok Gehlot government, Maderna was a key accused in Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) Bhanwari Devi’s murder that took place in September 2011. After the furore hit the headlines, Maderna was sacked on October 16 the same year.He was granted interim bail on health grounds on September 18 last year after he was diagnosed with malignancy.“He was out on bail since then. He moved a fresh application for permanent bail in August, admitting which, the high court allowed his bail plea and was granted bail like all the 16 accused in the case in August,” said his counsel Pradeep Choudhary.During the recently held Panchayat election in Rajasthan, Maderna returned to Jodhpur to oversee the election preparations with his wife Leela Maderna as a contestant for the post of Zila Pramukh in Jodhpur.The CBI had filed its first chargesheet in the Bhanwari Devi case in December 2011. The trial in the case is currently under way in the lower court with the recording of statements of defence witnesses under progress.

Wankhede is in news after he led a raid on a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast earlier this month and arrested actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan among others following alleged drug seizure.Independent witnesses which are present at crime scenes should have no prior connection to the investigation agency, said Malik, the state minority affairs minister.But this particular witness had been seen in pictures with Wankhede's family members in the past, the NCP leader alleged. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-ncb-staffers-friend-made-a-witness-in-three-cases-asks-malik-325620

17-10-2021||Washington||Climate financing area of worry: FM seeks clarity on $100 bn pledge||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said climate financing continues to be an area of worry as she flagged India’s concerns over funding mechanism and technology transfer.US firms have welcomed economic reformsThe Biden administration as well as leaders from the corporate sector in the US have welcomed as a very positive step the reforms undertaken by the Indian government, particularly the withdrawal of the retrospective tax. — Nirmala Sitharaman, FMHer remarks came ahead of the upcoming COP26 summit to be held at Glasgow in the United Kingdom. Leaders of nearly 200 countries, including India, will gather at the high-level summit on climate change, scheduled to be held from October 31 to November 12, to discuss the way forward to tackle climate action and submit their updated targets.Sitharaman said it is unclear how the USD 100 billion per year commitment given in the wake of COP21 has been extended.“From my side, of course, one of the issues that I did raise and it is also something which many people do take cognisance of, is we actually don’t know if there were any measures given to measure if money spent on a particular project by somebody will be part of that USD 100 billion,” Sitharaman said after the conclusion of her meetings at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank here on Friday.“So, what constitutes USD 100 billion? How do we measure if actually USD 100 billion has been given or only some of them had been given? So, not just that USD 100 billion per year is coming or not but how do we measure that it is indeed coming or not, is also one of the issues,” she said.Sitharaman said several participants, both in the IMF and World Bank meetings, highlighted this particular issue. “So funding is continuing to be a question of worry for many countries, as much as even the transfer of technology,” she said.“The issue is, again, as much as it is in the fund, do we know which technology that we are asking for transfer? Do we know which are those things which have to be considered for the debate and transfer of technology,” she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/climate-financing-area-of-worry-fm-seeks-clarity-on-100-bn-pledge-325623

Officials said personnel of the Army, Air Force and the Navy were on the way to Koottickal and Peruvanthanam — the two hilly villages falling under Kottayam and Idukki districts respectively — where an overflowing river swept through houses, displacing and isolating many.According to the India Meteorological Department, “red alert” was sounded for six districts — Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur and Palakkad. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/six-dead-12-missing-as-rains-lash-kerala-red-alert-sounded-325625

He termed it a conspiracy against the farmers’ agitation. Tikait said it would not affect farmers’ protest.BJP’s IT cell in-charge Amit Malviya said, “Twentyfour hours after the murder of Lakhbir Singh, Rahul Gandhi hasn’t said a word. “Neither has Punjab CM announced any compensation for the family, which hails from Punjab.”Citing police lathicharge on a group of protesting farmers in Congress-ruled states of Punjab and Rajasthan and a law on contract farming brought in by Punjab that says “farmers can be arrested for breaking the agreement”.

17-10-2021||Aditi Tandon||Congress president  poll by Sept 20 next year||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 16Sonia Gandhi will continue as interim chief until the Congress elects its new president by September 20 next in line with the internal election schedule the party’s working committee approved at a four-hour meeting held on Saturday. The Congress Working Committee (CWC) unanimously urged Sonia to continue till then, reposing faith in her leadership and dismissing recent voices of distrust emanating from the G-23. Two senior G-23 members, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma, attended the meeting.Lakhimpur a diabolic attack on farmers: CWCThe CWC called Lakhimpur Kheri a diabolic attack on farmers, slamming the Centre for not sacking MoS (Home) Ajay Mishra whose son was accused of murder in the case.Restoration of full J&K statehood soughtThe CWC sought restoration of full statehood to J&K along with polls and adopted resolutions against inflation, farm distress.Bigger role for Rahul?Importantly, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot even proposed for Rahul Gandhi to assume the Congress mantle, a suggestion the former party president said “he would consider”. The meeting, the party later said, progressed in a positive atmosphere with no “thunder or storm”.Rahul: Channi cried when told he’ll be CMFor some time during the CWC meeting, mood became sombre when Rahul Gandhi told the members Charanjit Singh Channi broke into tears when told he would be the Punjab CM. Present at the event, Channi said, “I could have never dreamt of being a CM as I am from a community where we are conditioned not to have any dreams.” Rahul, citing Channi’s example, said people expected the Congress to fight for them.‘Repeal move to raise BSF powers’The CWC also took note of the recent government notification extending the BSF jurisdiction from 15 to 50 km in states, including Punjab. It said the party would work with all stakeholders to press the government for repeal of the notification, which it termed a dangerous precedent and encroachment on state powers.The tone for deliberations was set this morning when Sonia, in a stern message to the G-23 leaders who had recently questioned her decision-making citing the absence of a full-time elected chief, said, “I am, if you will allow me to say so, a full-time and hands-on Congress president.” She also reminded the leaders that they need not speak to her through the media.“I have always appreciated frankness,” said the 74-year-old whom the CWC thanked for her guidance despite frail health.Without naming anyone, the Congress chief, in veiled response to the G-23’s routine refrain of the need to revive the Congress, said, “The entire organisation wants a revival of the Congress. But this requires unity and keeping the party’s interests paramount. Above all, it requires self-control and discipline. Undoubtedly, we face many challenges but if we are united, if we are disciplined and if we focus on the party’s interests alone, I am confident we will do well.”The Congress Working Committee, which was briefed on the party’s preparedness for the upcoming five state polls, later approved the organisational election schedule with the membership drive slated between November 1 this year and March 31 next.Elections for block committees and one member each of the Pradesh Congress Committee will be held from April 16 to May 31, 2022; district committee chiefs and executive will be elected between June 1 and July 20; PCC chiefs and AICC members between July 21 and August 20 and AICC president between August 21 and September 20, 2022.“After the Congress chief, elections for the CWC and other bodies will be held at the plenary expected preferably in September or October 2022,” said AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal. The CWC passed three resolutions—a political resolution attacking the government for “deteriorating internal and external security situation and demanding restoration of full statehood to J&K along with elections”; a resolution against inflation and another on farmers’ distress.The CWC also condemned Lakhimpur Kheri killings, slamming the Centre for not sacking MoS (Home) Ajay Mishra whose son was accused of murder in the case.In other important decisions, the working committee cleared a proposal for organising regular training programmes for party workers and leaders in party ideology, expectations from a Congress worker, grassroots messaging, election management, government’s failures and countering propaganda.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-president-poll-by-sept-20-next-year-325613

He said the BJP was “keeping mum” on the issue of rising prices of fuel and accused the saffron party of not lowering rates of petrol and diesel despite a fall in the international prices of crude.“Thackeray was selected by leaders of three parties (in the MVA). When we held a meeting to form the MVA and to discuss the leadership of the alliance, I forced him (Uddhav Thackeray) to become the CM. I have seen these people since their childhood. (Shiv Sena founder) Balasaheb Thackeray and I might have political differences but we were close.“I thought why not the son of a person who had contributed for Maharashtra should become the CM and I insisted Uddhav Thackeray to become the CM. Fadnavis had worked with Uddhav so he knows how Uddhav is. He should stop questioning repeatedly about how Uddhav became CM,” the NCP chief said.Earlier in the day, Fadnavis had alleged that the MVA government was formed through dishonesty. “I feel that respected Uddhavji should now accept that he had ambitions of becoming a CM which he fulfilled. In politics, having ambitions is not wrong. But if you wanted to keep the word, you could have made senior Sena leaders Diwakar Raote, Subhash Desai or Eknath Shinde a CM,” Fadnavis said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pawars-snipe-at-fadnavis-i-insisted-uddhav-be-cm-325618

Travel in the hilly areas or places where rains are occurring should be best avoided and areas prone to landslides should also to be watchful,” said Vijayan.State ministers have been asked to coordinate with the various teams of the police, fire force and the disaster management teams and have started their work.Later after chairing a meeting of top officials, Vijayan said all arrangements are in place and none need to be worried as various relief camps have been opened and all facilities will be made available at the camps.He also emphasised that the people in the camps should be aware that Covid protocols should be followed.Meanwhile, in areas where there are heavy rains, tourist centres have been asked to close down until further notice and boating services have also been suspended.At Pathanamthitta district, a car was swept away by the rushing waters but an alert auto-rickshaw driver, sensing the danger, threw stones at the car which broke the windshield allowing the driver to come out through it who swam to safety.Meanwhile, the saving grace is that the rains appear to have slowed down and that has come handy for those engaged in rescue and relief operations. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/8-dead-4-missing-as-heavy-rains-lash-kerala-325424

It cannot be allowed to continue."Besides seeking the removal of protesting farmers, the plea has also sought the issuance of guidelines by the Centre to the states and Union Territories to stop all kinds of protests and not permit them until the pandemic gets over.

17-10-2021||Aditi Tandon||Election for Congress chief to be concluded by September 2022||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 16The Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Saturday decided that the election to the post of Congress president will be concluded by September 2022.The CWC passed three resolutions — Political, against inflation and on farmers. It attacked the Centre for deteriorating internal and external security situation, the Lakhimpur Kheri killings and the recent BSF notification and resolved to work with like minded parties to force the government to repeal the BSF order.“The CWC unanimously asked Sonia Gandhi to continue as party chief until the next president’s election,” AICC media head Randeep Surjewala said.During a five-and-a-half-hour long meeting of the CWC, which is the party’s highest decision-making body, several leaders, including chief ministers Ashok Gehlot of Rajasthan, Bhupesh Baghel of Chhattisgarh and Charanjit Singh Channi of Punjab urged Rahul Gandhi to take over as the president.“Many leaders of the CWC also proposed that Rahul Gandhi should take over the party chief’s role, Rahul Gandhi thanked leaders for the affection,” Surjewala said.All senior leaders, including AK Antony, Ambika Soni, Ghulam Nabi Azad, P Chidambaram, Anand Sharma, Harish Rawat, KC Venugopal, Randeep Surjewala, Priyanka Vadra, Jairam Ramesh and Ajay Maken attending the meeting.Chief ministers of Punjab Charanjit Singh Channi, Chhattisgarh Bhupesh Baghel and Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot were also present.The last meeting of the CWC, held on January 22, had postponed the organisational elections until the Covid situation eased.Today’s meeting is the first in a physical format since Covid outbreak.Of late, the Congress has been faced with massive factionalism across state units in Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and the pro-revamp G-23 group has been active.In Punjab, trouble continues between state party chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi; in Chhattisgarh health minister TS Singh Deo is reminding the party of its promise to rotate the CM’s post after two and a half years of rule; in Rajasthan, former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot is seeking accommodation while CM Ashok Gehlot looks the other way.On September 29, G-23 leaders Kapil Sibal and Azad had demanded a CWC meeting urgently to discuss the challenges and also why leaders like Sushmita Dev were leaving the Congress.“In our party at the moment there is no president. So we don't know who is making these decisions. We know and yet we don't know," Sibal had said, adding that it was ironic how those who have left the Congress are the closest aides of Gandhis while those they think are not close to them are still in the Congress.The CWC will also discuss the prevailing political situation in the country and the ongoing farmers’ protest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/election-for-congress-chief-to-be-concluded-by-september-2022-325397
