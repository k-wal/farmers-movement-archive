21-10-2021||Mumbai||Nawab Malik launches fresh salvo on NCB’s Sameer Wankhede over foreign visits; officer says never went to Dubai||Continuing his tirade against NCB Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede, Maharashtra minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik on Thursday claimed the officer was specifically brought to the agency by the Centre post the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput after which it started “playing games with the film industry”, and sought to know the motive behind his visits to the Maldives and Dubai.Wankhede refuted the slew of allegations made so far against him by Malik and said he has never been to Dubai though he has visited the Maldives along with his family after taking permission from the central government.Malik also alleged that Rajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty was implicated in a “fake case” by the NCB.Wankhede supervised a raid on a cruise liner off the Mumbai coast earlier this month that led to the alleged recovery of drugs, following which Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan and some other people were arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).Malik has repeatedly claimed the case related to the alleged recovery of banned drugs from the ship was “fake” and arrests were made just on the basis of WhatsApp chats.The NCP leader’s son-in-law Sameer Khan was also arrested by the NCB in a drugs case in January this year and he was granted bail last month.“After Sushant Singh Rajput’s suicide (in June 2020), a special officer was brought in to the NCB. The suicide case was handed over the CBI, but the mystery over his suicide or murder remains unresolved. But, after that, the NCB started playing games with the film industry,” Malik claimed.He said dozens of actors were “paraded “before the NCB merely on the basis of WhatsApp chats.“Attempts were made to implicate certain people in false cases. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the entire film industry was in the Maldives. What was the officer and his family doing in the Maldives and Dubai? This has to be clarified by Sameer Wankhede,” the NCP spokesperson said.“We demand that he clarify whether he was in Dubai,” Malik said.Was his family there in the Maldives when the entire film industry was in the Maldives? What was the reason behind them going there? he asked.“We are very clear. All this ‘vasuli’ (extortion) took place in Maldives and Dubai and I will release those photos,” Malik said.On Wednesday, Malik renewed his demand to check WhatsApp chats of Wankhede, saying it will reveal how bogus the NCB cases are.The IRS officer, speaking to the media, condemned the relentless verbal attack on him and rejected the allegations made by Malik.“The allegations of my visit to Dubai are totally false. This is false information. I was in Mumbai on the date the minister has mentioned in his allegations and he can fully investigate it,” he said.The photo which Malik has tweeted (to claim he was in Dubai) is from Mumbai and not Dubai, Wankhede said.He said the NCP leader can use established mechanisms to check his location on the given date, go through data from the Mumbai airport and gather other relevant information.Wankhede, however, said he did visit the Maldives.“I went to the Maldives with my family after taking permission from the government,” he said, adding if Malik is linking the visit to “extortion” then it is not appropriate.Asked whether he met any celebrity in the Maldives, Wankhede replied in the negative. “I did not meet anybody there. It was with all due permissions...everything was legal...have not done anything wrong.”Queried about Malik’s reported remarks that Wankhede will not be in government service by the year-end, the IRS officer quipped that his wishes are with the minister, whose party is a key constituent in the Shiv Sena-led MVA government.“He is a big minister and I am a small government servant..., if he wants to send me to jail for service to the nation, honest work and anti-drugs action then I am welcoming it,” said Wankhede.“There has been continuous personal attack since the last 15 days against my dead mother, my retired father and my sister and I am condemning the attack,” he said.Asked about the allegation that he was brought to the NCB to target Bollywood and “defame” Maharashtra, Wankhede said he applied to join the central agency in 2019 when “the (drugs) case (related to film industry) was not with us”.Responding to the allegations over foreign visits, NCB Deputy Director (South Region) Ashok Mutha Jain issued a press note in which he said Wankhede joined the agency on “loan basis” on August 31, 2020, and after this he has not submitted any application for ex-India leave to Dubai.“As per the approval of Competent Authority vide NCB Order on July 27, 2021, the officer has availed ex-lndia leave along with his family to Maldives,” the note said.

21-10-2021||Lucknow||‘Fuel prices don’t matter, 95 pc people don’t need petrol’: UP minister||Dismissing criticism over the rising fuel prices, Uttar Pradesh minister Upendra Tiwari on Thursday said 95 per cent people have no use for petrol.Tiwari also argued that fuel prices had not really risen in real terms when the per capita income now is compared with that in 2014, referring to the year when a BJP-led government first came to power at the Centre.“Today, there are just a handful of people who travel in four-wheel vehicles and use petrol. At present, 95 per cent people don’t need petrol,” Tiwari told reporters in Jalaun.Higher fuel costs, however, impact virtually every citizen. For example, they lead to an increase in the price of all commodities—including foodgrain, fruit and vegetables—that are transported from one part of the country to another.The minister’s remark comes when petrol prices have crossed Rs 100 per litre in most parts of the country, and diesel hovers close to that mark.He claimed that the opposition doesn’t have any real issue to attack the government.“You see the data before 2014. What is the per capita income after the formation of the Modi and the Yogi governments?” he said, referring to the BJP-led governments at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh.“Today, the per capita income is double,” he claimed.He also referred to free schooling and the coronavirus vaccination offered by the government.

21-10-2021||Mumbai||Drugs case: Aryan Khan’s judicial custody extended till October 30||A special NDPS court here on Thursday extended the judicial custody of Aryan Khan, son of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, and seven others till October 30 in connection with the case of seizure of banned drugs from a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast earlier this month.Their judicial custody was extended by Special Judge V V Patil, designated to hear cases related to the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, though they were not produced in the court.On Wednesday, the same court had rejected the bail pleas of Aryan Khan and two other co-accused in the case.Besides Aryan Khan (23), the other accused whose judicial custody was extended by the court are Arbaaz Merchant, Munmun Dhamecha, Nupur Sarika, Ismeet Singh, Mohak Jaswal, Vikrant Chhoker and Gomit Chopra. Their current judicial custody was till October 21.The previous day, besides Aryan Khan, lodged in the Arthur Road jail in central Mumbai, the NDPS court had rejected the bail pleas of his friend Arbaaz Merchant (26) and fashion model Munmun Dhamecha (28).While denying bail to the trio, the special court had noted that the WhatsApp chats of Aryan Khan prima facie revealed he was indulging in “illicit drug activities on a regular basis” and that he was in touch with drug peddlers.The court also held that Aryan Khan knew his friend and co-accused Arbaaz Merchant was in possession of drugs and hence this amounts to “conscious possession” even though the NCB (Narcotics Control Bureau) had made no recovery of drugs from him.Aryan Khan, Merchant and Dhamecha have moved the Bombay High court for bail and their pleas will be heard on October 26.Meanwhile, the special court on Thursday heard the arguments on bail pleas of three other accused — Achit Kumar, the alleged drug supplier to Aryan Khan, Manish Rajgaria and Avin Sahu.Advocate Taraq Sayed, appearing for Rajgaria, submitted that his client was arrested right after the cruise ship came back from Goa in connection with alleged recovery of 2.4 grams of ganja, “a nano-small quantity”.However, he argued that ‘panchnama’ doesn’t mention from where the contraband was allegedly recovered.Citing the last year’s drugs case related to actor Rhea Chakraborty, Sayed said even in that matter 33 people were arrested, but not all were connected.He said there can be a connection between people, but the NCB should show their link with drugs.Sahu’s lawyer Sana Khan claimed nothing has been recovered from her client. The only allegation against Sahu was that he consumed ganja twice while on the cruise, she said.While making submissions for Kumar, his lawyer Ashwin Thool claimed that Kumar’s custody was illegal as he wasn’t produced before a court within 24 hours of detention.Citing an application of Kumar’s father, Thool argued he was illegally detained by the NCB from 5.14 pm on October 5.As per the NCB, he was formally arrested on October 6 and produced before the court the next day. He also relied on a TV report where there is a video of him being taken into the NCB office on October 5.Referring to the panchnama, Thool argued it is a “fabricated and concocted document”, and cannot be relied upon.The lawyer argued that Kumar has nothing to do with party on the cruise.On the probe agency’s claim that he was part of drug network, Thool argued “They say I am part of a ganja network. Have they got even one person to say that a one paisa was taken or given to me? At least one transaction, no.”    The hearing of the bail pleas will continue on October 22.The NCB has arrested as many as 20 people in connection with the case until now. Further investigation into the matter was on. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drugs-case-aryan-khans-judicial-custody-extended-till-october-30-327609

Accordingly, she along with her father Chunky Panday appeared before the NCB officials, the sources said.The NCB officials, however, are yet to clarify about her role, if any, in the case.There was heavy deployment of police outside the NCB office and a large number of media persons were also present there. Aryan Khan was arrested with a few others on October 3 after the NCB raided a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast and claimed to have seized drugs, including charas.An NCB team visited Shah Rukh Khan’s residence ‘Mannat’ in suburban Bandra this afternoon for seeking from him certain material related to the investigation into the case, an official said.On Thursday morning, Shah Rukh Khan met his son Aryan Khan at the Arthur Road jail in Mumbai where the latter has been lodged following his arrest in the case.

21-10-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala CPM leader booked for kidnapping after daughter’s complaint||A 23-year-old woman, daughter of a senior CPM leader here, has accused her parents of forcefully having taken away her new-born child from her soon after its birth a year ago and approached the police seeking to get the baby back.Anupama S Chandran, daughter of CPM local committee member P S Jayachandran, alleged that though she had lodged a complaint with the police several times since April, they were reluctant to register a case against the family members.However, police here said a case was registered on Tuesday against six people including her parents, sister and husband and father’s two friends, and said the delay happened as they were waiting for the legal opinion.Multiple charges, under IPC Section 343 (wrongful confinement), 361 (kidnapping from wrongful guardianship), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and so on, were imposed against the accused, they said.A former leader of the Students’ Federation of India (SFI), a feeder organisation of the CPM, Anupama alleged that though she had submitted her complaint to the senior Marxist party leaders including Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, no one had helped her to get her baby back.“Is this the way the how the police should react when a woman approaches them with the missing complaint of her child? Do they seek legal opinion for every such case? I strongly feel that the delay was made deliberately to protect my father and family members,” she told media.According to Anupama’s complaint, her parents did not like her relationship with Ajith, who was also a youth federation leader of the Left party.As the child was born out of wedlock, they had forcefully taken away the boy child, three days after she got discharged from the hospital post delivery.She left home in April and has been living with Ajith since then, she said.Police, however, said, her father Jayachandran admitted that the child was separated from his daughter by them, but claimed during the interrogation that it was done with her consent.“The father claimed she had given her consent in a signed stamp paper that she has no objection to hand over the child as she was not able to take care of the infant. However, the complainant said that the family had made her sign on the paper by force,” a police officer told PTI.According to the father’s statement, the child was placed in “Ammathottil”, the electric cradle located in front of the state-run Child Welfare Centre at Thycaud here in October last year.As per the rules of the centre, when they receive a child in the cradle, they would keep it with them for the next two months, he said adding that if no one comes claiming the child’s ownership, they would allow the public to adopt the infant.“We have contacted the Welfare Committee authorities...they have admitted that they received a child on the same day but not ready to reveal anything further as it is against their rules and norms regarding adoption,” the police officer added.The probe is still going on to collect more details and trace the baby, the official said.Meanwhile, the State Women’s Commission on Thursday registered a case into the incident based on the woman’s complaint.The Commission chairperson, P Sathidevi sought an immediate report from the police chief in this regard and decided to summon the accused during its sitting scheduled next month, an official statement said here.

Let's give the Government credit."                "After severe mismanagement of the second Covid wave & botching the vaccination orders that might have prevented it, Govt has now partly redeemed itself. It remains accountable for its earlier failures," the Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram said.Tagging Tharoor's tweet, Khera, a Congress spokesperson, said giving credit to "the government is an insult to millions of families who suffered and are still suffering from the after-effects and side effects of widespread Covid mismanagement"."Before seeking credit, PM must apologise to those families. The credit belongs to scientists & medical fraternity," he tweeted.

It cannot be an unending story," the bench had observed while asking the police to give a timeline for concluding the probe."We will list it on Monday," the bench, which also comprised Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli, said.Senior advocate AM Singhvi, appearing for Singh, said the accused had been in jail for the last two years. Moreover, his custody is not needed for the investigation as two charge sheets had already been filed, he added.Delhi Police have said they need four more months to conclude the investigation if unforseen circumstances do not hit the ongoing probe, the bench said after perusing the report of the police. In May, the Delhi High Court cancelled Singh's bail, noting that his detention was necessary to unearth the “conspiracy hatched by him" and trace the alleged siphoned-off money.The order was passed on a plea by Religare challenging the March 3 order of the trial court granting bail to Singh in the case registered against him by the EOW under charges of cheating, criminal conspiracy and criminal breach of trust.Singh has moved the top court against the Delhi High Court cancelling the bail granted to him by the trial court in the case.

Thereafter, during investigation, the role of accused came to the notice of the investigation officer after which the approval was sought, he said.During the arguments, the counsel appearing for the accused had said anyone can be said to be member of the syndicate if the arguments of the prosecution are to be accepted.Kavitha Lankesh’s counsel had argued that the high court had erred in coming to the conclusion that KCOCA was not applicable against the accused. He referred to the role of the accused, as noted in the high court order, and said it was alleged he had taken a house on rent in the guise of running an acupressure clinic but it was meant to accommodate members of the syndicate.In its order, the high court had said, “If the approval order itself is bad in law, the sanction order, the charge sheet and the approval order so far as the offences under the Act (KCOCA) against the petitioner (Nayak) have no legs to stand.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gauri-lankesh-murder-sc-sets-aside-hc-order-quashing-charge-sheet-against-accused-for-kcoca-offences-327561

Estimated cost savings achieved in the initial management of casualty by tele-consultation was about Rs 1.46 lakh per case.A study, undertaken recently by three army doctors, including the Deputy Chief of Integrated Defence Staff (Medical), found that 34.2 per cent of casualties could successfully be stabilised on-site using available health care resources with the peripheral hospitals. Each year 18 casualties were managed at the periphery on-site by tele-consultations, averting air transportation efforts.Air evacuation of casualties from the rugged, mountainous terrain in the northern sector as well as the north-east is an important aspect of management of serious medical cases, whether physical injury or other illness. Pointing out that the strength of telemedicine is knowledge updation, faster decision-making, improved pre-hospital care and increased confidence in case management, the study observed that reduction in air effort and enhancing remote management of casualties make a substantive case for scaling up telemedicine interventions.Telemedicine is of immense significance to the Armed Forces as the nature of their jobs and the terrain in which they are deployed makes them vulnerable to injury or illness.  At times, immediate evacuation, either by air or road, may not be possible due to weather conditions, operational reasons or enemy activity.The Armed Forces began its foray into telemedicine soon after the 1999 Kargil conflict, with some medical establishments in forward areas being linked to larger hospitals over data lines. Connectivity and low bandwidth, however, were issues. In 2005, a pilot project was implemented with the Army Research and Referral Hospital, New Delhi, being connected with hospitals in Srinagar, Udhampur, Kargil, Leh, Partapur and Port Blair.The Indian Space Research Organisation, too, was roped in at a later stage to execute a project to set up 65 telemedicine centres through satellite communication and dedicated software. More centres have been planned, by the Armed Forces, including linking ships at sea, besides having vehicle-based and man-pack links.Telemedicine consultation got a fillip during the pandemic period when patients, even in peace stations and cities, were encouraged to interact with doctors through online means.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telemedicine-significantly-reduces-cost-of-managing-casualties-in-border-areas-says-army-study-327543

21-10-2021||Satya Prakash||Lakhimpur violence: Prepare foolproof case, dispel notion you’re dragging your feet, SC tells SIT||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 20The Supreme Court on Wednesday asked the Uttar Pradesh SIT probing the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, in which eight persons, including four farmers, were killed on October 3, to record statements of more witnesses before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC to prepare a foolproof case.“We get the impression that you are dragging your feet… Please do the needful to dispel that,” a three-Judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana told senior advocate Harish Salve, who represented the Uttar Pradesh Government.Also read: Ashes of Lakhimpur Kheri victims immersedAfter perusing a status report filed by the Uttar Pradesh Government, the Bench repeatedly sought to know the number of accused arrested, the status of their police or judicial custody and how many witnesses’ statements had been recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC, which will make it difficult for them to retract.Salve told the court that so far 10 accused had been arrested in connection with the death of farmers and statements of 40 witnesses before police and four before a magistrate had been recorded. He said four of the accused were in police custody.As the Bench sought to know why the rest of the accused were not in police custody, Salve explained that they were initially in police custody and after their interrogation and recording of statements, they were sent to judicial custody.The Bench, which also included Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli, clarified that it wanted the SIT to record statements of witnesses under Section 164 of the CrPC as many of them might be vulnerable to threat.“Recording of statements under Section 164 is different! It’s before a Judicial Magistrate. Its evidentiary value is far better…Your SIT can recognise who are the most vulnerable witnesses and can be browbeaten.. then why only four witness statements (under Section 164, CrPC) have been recorded?” the CJI asked Salve, who said the investigation was still on and it got delayed because courts were closed for Dasehra vacation. Directing the Uttar Pradesh Government to file a further updated status report, the top court posted the matter for further hearing on October 26.At the very outset of the hearing, the Bench took exception to filing of the status report in a sealed cover. “No, that was not required…. We have just received it now... I waited till 1 am last night for any filing. But we received nothing.”As the CJI said the report has to be filed at least a day before the scheduled hearing, Salve assured that the next status report on the SIT probe would be filed by Monday.The top court asked the SIT to bifurcate the two cases – mowing down of farmers by an SUV and the subsequent lynching of BJP workers by an angry mob. Salve told the Bench that it was difficult to investigate the second case.The Bench — which had on October 8 expressed dissatisfaction over the manner in which the Uttar Pradesh Police had handled the probe into the “brutal” murders – asked the UP Government to ensure that the victims and witnesses were protected properly.Four farmers were mowed down by an SUV in Lakhimpur Kheri when farmers agitating against farm laws were holding a demonstration against Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit on October 3. Two BJP workers and a driver were beaten to death allegedly by angry protesters. A local journalist was also killed in the violence.Ten people, including Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra Teni’s son Ashish Mishra, have been arrested in the case by an SIT set up by the UP Government.Dissatisfied with the handling of the case, the top court had on October 8 pulled up the UP Police for their failure to arrest accused Ashish Mishra, who has since been arrested.The Bench – which had earlier hinted at handing over the probe to an agency other than the CBI – didn’t talk about changing the probe agency on Wednesday.Acting on a letter written by advocates Shiv Kumar Tripathi and CS Panda, the top court had on October 7 taken up their plea for a CBI probe into the matter. On Wednesday, Tripathi urged the Bench to direct the UP Government to make a copy of the status report available to him to enable him to assist the court. However, the CJI declined his request, saying there were some sensitive issues involved. “We will see it on the next date,” the CJI told Tripathi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-violence-prepare-foolproof-case-dispel-notion-youre-dragging-your-feet-sc-tells-sit-327210

He said due to the hard work of his government in the last six-seven years, a faith had been established among people that corruption could be stopped. “People have faith today that they will get benefits of government schemes without any give and take or without any middlemen,” he said.“Corruption, big or small, takes away the rights of common people. It is a hindrance in the progress of the country and affects our collective energy,” he said, while noting that the previous government lacked the will to control corruption.After independence, he said, the mindset of the governments was to keep everything under their control. Those governments kept maximum control with themselves and due to it the system witnessed many wrong practices, he said, adding: “Maximum control, be it at home, in family or in the country, causes maximum damage.”“We started as a mission to simplify the life of people by reducing controls, we believe in minimum government and maximum governance,” he said, while asking the CBI and CVC to brainstorm on how to find ways to save people from cyber frauds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ensure-no-safe-haven-to-those-who-betray-india-pm-to-cbi-cvc-327229

Headed by junior officers, who have been given freedom of operations, each unit has an integrated infantry troops, artillery, engineers, air defence guns, drones, aviation assets and even armed helicopters.Aggressive strategy Major Rufus Johnson, a leader of one such unit stationed along Bumla-Assam hill axis at 15,000 feet, told a group of mediapersons that during a battle, independent decision-making at lower levels was encouraged. Major Johnson and other leaders at his level can requisition artillery fire from Bofors guns and also from the latest M777 ultra light howitzer (ULH) stationed just south of the LAC. Troops on ground are carrying the latest Sig Sauer assault rifles. A live feed of the situation on ground across the LAC keeps the integrated units well informed and enables decision-making.A senior functionary said, “These are the areas through which the Peoples’ Liberation Army (PLA) attacked in 1962. Defensive positions and offensive capabilities have been continuously upgraded and this integration of all assets is the latest”.Ironically, the PLA attack started on this very day – October 20 — in 1962. A method of keeping the troops fit is called a “190 plan” devised by the 190 Brigade headquartered at Tawang. It is a mix of meditation, yoga and strenuous exercise.On the infrastructure front, helipads built at forwards locations allow quick movement of troops and materials. Roads leading to forward posts are paved. Troops at the unit have been provided with new technology water supply pipes that prevent water from freezing in the winters when temperature drops to minus 20 degrees.

After stopping Priyanka at the Lucknow-Agra Expressway citing orders of the Agra District Magistrate, the Uttar Pradesh Police permitted her and three others to proceed to Agra.This was the second time this month that the Congress leader was prevented from travelling to meet families of victims of violence, the first being in the aftermath of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence that killed eight.Arun Valmiki, a sanitation worker accused of stealing Rs 25 lakh from the Jagdishpura police station here, died in police custody after his health deteriorated during interrogation. The police claimed he was taken to hospital, where doctors declared him dead.“Arun Valmiki died in police custody. His family is seeking justice. I want to go and meet the family. What is the UP Government afraid of? Why am I being stopped? Today is the Jayanti of Bhagwan Valmiki. The PM spoke of the ideals of Lord Buddha, but the UP Government is attacking those very ideals,” Priyanka said earlier, asking the police what potential law and order disruption her visit to a grieving family could cause.Earlier today, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had also said no one would be allowed to “play with the law”.After she was detained at the police lines following a massive jam along the expressway, Lucknow Police Commissioner DK Thakur said, “Priyanka Vadra has neither been taken into custody, nor arrested. Because massive crowds had gathered along the road and movement of traffic was being hampered, she was first asked to either go to her party office or her residence. When she did not agree, she was sent to the police lines.”Citing her fundamental right to free movement, she said, “If I am at my office, it is fine; if I am at my home, it is fine, but the moment I want to travel anywhere in UP there’s a problem.

The ‘integrated defended locality’ is a specialised unit comprising various arms of the Army, including infantry, air defence, and artillery.Military officials said the upgraded L70 guns were deployed in several key locations in Arunachal Pradesh in addition to other sensitive positions along the entire LAC and that their inductions have significantly enhanced the Army’s air defence mechanism.“The guns can bring down all unmanned aerial vehicles, unmanned combat aerial vehicles, attack helicopters and modern aircraft. The gun has enhanced target acquisition and automatic target tracking capability under all weather conditions with high-resolution electro-optical sensors comprising a daylight television camera, a thermal imaging camera and a laser-range finder,” said Capt Sariya Abbasi of the Army Air Defence.“The gun is also equipped with a Muzzle Velocity Radar for enhancing the accuracy of fire. The gun has the ability to be integrated with tactical and fire control radars which give it more flexibility in its deployment,” she said.Capt Abbasi said the legacy gun has now been transformed into a sophisticated air defence gun.Another official said the upgraded gun system that operates along with a high-end Israeli radar can be counted among the best available air defence guns in its class globally.In the last few months, the Army has deployed a good number of easily transportable M-777 ultra light howitzer guns which are at times moved from one place to another in Chinook helicopters depending on operational requirement.The M-777 artillery guns, having a maximum range of 30 km and manufactured by the BAE Systems, were first received by the Army in 2018. The procurement had come after a 30-year wait for new artillery guns since the Bofors scandal.“The addition of upgraded L70 air defence guns to the existing Bofors guns and recently inducted M-777 howitzers significantly enhanced the Indian Army’s overall operational capability,” said a senior official on condition of anonymity.The L70 guns were originally manufactured by Swedish defence firm Bofors AB in 1950s and India has started inducting over 1,000 of them in the 1960s.The guns have been upgraded by state-run Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL).Following the escalation in tension in eastern Ladakh standoff, the Army has taken a series of measures to boost its operational capabilities in the eastern sector bordering China that included procurement of all terrain vehicles, precision guided ammunition, high-tech surveillance equipment, radars and weapons.Officials said enhancing combat capability is a continuous process and it will go in sync with operational requirements and overall security situation.They said an equal amount of focus has been given to enhancing operational capability in the Northern as well as eastern sector.Eastern Army Commander Lt Gen Manoj Pande on Tuesday said that China has increased the intensity of military exercises and deployment of troops in its depth areas opposite the Arunachal Pradesh sector and that India has correspondingly readied contingency plans to deal with any eventualities.The commander asserted that the Indian preparedness to respond to any contingency is of a “very high order”.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.The tension escalated following a deadly clash in Galwan Valley on June 15 last year.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in the Gogra area in August and in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in February.The last round of military talks on October 10 ended in a stalemate following which both sides blamed each other for the impasse.In a strong statement after the 13th round of talks, the Indian Army said the “constructive suggestions” made by it at the negotiations were neither agreeable to the Chinese side nor could Beijing provide any “forward-looking” proposals.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.

21-10-2021||Beijing||Indian diplomat’s mike goes silent at UN conference while criticising China’s BRI||India has voiced its strong opposition to China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its flagship project - the CPEC - at the just concluded second UN Sustainable Transport Conference where the Indian diplomat’s mike curiously went silent while she was highlighting New Delhi’s objection to the controversial projects.The sudden “mike failure” at the UN meet hosted by China here from October 14 to 16 created a flutter and took several minutes to restore.Even the video of the next speaker began to play but it was halted by UN under-secretary-general Liu Zhenmin, the former vice foreign minister of China, who urged the Indian diplomat, Priyanka Sohoni, Second Secretary of the Indian Embassy here, to continue her speech. After the mike system was restored at the conference hall, Liu said, “Dear participants, we are sorry. We are confronting some technical problems and played the video of the next speaker. I am sorry for that” and asked Sohoni to resume her speech.“You are lucky..You are back and welcome back,” he told Sohoni following which the Indian diplomat continued her speech without interruption.“We share the international community’s desire for enhancing physical connectivity and believe it should bring greater economic benefits to all in an equitable and balanced manner,” Sohoni said.“Expansion and strengthening of physical connectivity is an integral part of India’s economic and diplomatic initiatives,” she said.“There have been some references to the Belt and Road Initiative or BRI at this conference. Here, I wish to say that as far as China’s BRI is concerned, we are uniquely affected by it. It’s inclusion of the so-called China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship project impinges on India’s sovereignty,” Sohoni said.The BRI is a multi-billion-dollar initiative launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping when he came to power in 2013. It aims to enhance China’s influence and also link Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf region, Africa and Europe with a network of land and sea routes.The USD 60 billion CPEC, which connects Gwadar Port in Pakistan’s Balochistan with China’s Xinjiang province, is the flagship project of the BRI.India has been vocally objecting to China over the CPEC as it is being laid through the Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK). Beijing for its part is playing down India’s objections, saying it is an economic initiative and has not affected its principled stand on the Kashmir issue.“No country can support an initiative that ignores its core concerns on sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Sohoni said.“This aside there are also larger issues regarding how connectivity initiatives should be pursued. We are of the firm belief that connectivity initiatives must be based on universally recognised international norms,” she said.“They must follow principles of openness, transparency and financial responsibility and be pursued in a manner that respects sovereignty, equality and territorial integrity of nations. India for its part abides by these principles and stands ready to make collective efforts for sustainable development through a human-centric approach,” she said.Sohoni also said India has adopted bold measures in the realm of clean energy, energy efficiency, deforestation and biodiversity.“We have ambitious renewable energy target of 450 GW by 2030 demonstrating our commitment towards combating climate change. It is not without a reason therefore we are among few countries whose NDC (Nationally Determined are two degrees compatible,” she said.“We are on track and exceed our commitments and targets from Paris. A drop of 24 per cent in emission intensity has already been achieved,” she said.Earlier, a few speakers ahead of Sohoni, a Pakistani diplomat had showered praise on the BRI and its flagship project CPEC, terming it as a “game-changer” for the region.Xi, who aggressively promoted BRI in the last few years, himself referred to it in his speech on the opening day of the UN conference on October 14 which focussed on promoting sustainable transport to bring down the carbon emissions.“China will not change course in its pursuit of a new system of open economy of higher standards, and China will not waver in its resolve to promote trade and investment liberalisation and facilitation,” Xi said.“China’s door of opening-up will only open wider, and will never be closed. China will continue to advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, strengthen infrastructure connectivity with other countries, and develop a green Silk Road and a digital Silk Road at a faster pace,” he said.After Sohoni’s speech, Chinese transport minister Li Xiaopeng, who was present at the conference, responded to the Indian diplomat’s criticism.“I would like to extend my apologies for the technical glitch just now when the Indian delegate spoke,” Li said.“I don’t want to be offensive. Just now you have mentioned a lot of topics. As for the topics you mentioned, I would like to make some complements,” Li said in an apparent reference to Sohoni’s speech.“The BRI is open and inclusive. We tried to improve the connectivity and seek the development of all countries. In the past eight years, all the international communities have welcomed this initiative. Up to now about 141 countries and 32 organisations have signed more than 200 agreements with China,” Li said.“A lot of important and practical projects have been implemented, which includes a lot of important transport projects. I would like to invite all parties to contribute to the development of this (BRI) project,” Li said.Diplomatic sources said the Chinese minister’s response at the conference to the Indian diplomat may constitute a breach of UN protocol.

21-10-2021||Mumbai||Aryan Khan moves Bombay HC for bail in cruise drugs case||A special court here on Wednesday denied bail to Aryan Khan, the son of Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, observing that ‘on the face of it’, he was indulging in “illicit drug activities on a regular basis”.His WhatsApp chats also showed, prima facie, that he was in touch with drug peddlers, the court noted.Aryan (23), arrested with a few others on October 3 after the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) raided a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast and claimed to have seized drugs including charas, has now moved the Bombay High Court. VV Patil, special judge for the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act cases, rejected the bail pleas of Aryan Khan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant (26) and fashion model Munmun Dhamecha (28).The lawyers of Aryan Khan and Dhamecha moved the High Court seeking bail soon thereafter. The matter is likely to be mentioned on Thursday before Justice NW Sambre seeking urgent hearing, legal sources said.The special NDPS Act court in its 21-page order noted that WhatsApp chats of Aryan Khan prima facie revealed that he was “dealing in illicit drug activities on a regular basis” and therefore it cannot be said that he was not likely to commit a similar offence if released on bail.It also held that Aryan knew that his friend and co-accused Arbaaz Merchant was in possession of drugs, and hence there was “conscious possession” even though the NCB had not found any drugs on Aryan himself.“Considering the prima facie involvement of the applicants/accused No 1 to 3 (Aryan Khan, Merchant and Dhamecha) in commission of grave and serious offence, this is not a fit case for granting bail,” the judge said in the order.The material placed before it by the NCB showed on the face of it that section 29 of the NDPS Act, pertaining to conspiracy, was applicable, said the court.“Therefore, it is not possible to record a satisfaction at this stage that the applicants have not committed any offence under the NDPS Act,” the order said.Case papers and voluntary statements of Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant disclosed that they possessed drugs for consumption and enjoyment, the court noted further.“These things go to show that accused No 1 (Aryan) was having knowledge of the contraband concealed by accused No 2 (Merchant) in his shoes,” it said.“Although no contraband is found in the possession of accused No 1, six grams of charas was found in possession of accused No 2 of which accused No 1 (Aryan) was having knowledge and thus it can be said that it was in conscious possession of both the accused,” the court added.In Aryan’s WhatsApp chats, there is reference to “bulk quantity and hard drugs” and “there is prima facie material showing that accused No 1 was in contact with persons dealing in prohibited narcotic substances”, the order said.“Prima facie it appears that there is a case of conspiracy and abetment as alleged by the prosecution,” it said.Earlier, a magistrate’s court had rejected the accused’s bail pleas, saying only a special court can hear these matters.Khan, Merchant and Dhamecha, among others, were arrested on October 3 for alleged conspiracy, possession, consumption, purchase and trafficking of drugs under the NDPS Act.They are now in judicial custody. While Aryan Khan and Merchant are lodged at the Arthur Road prison, Dhamecha is lodged at the Byculla women’s prison in the city.So far, 20 persons have been arrested in the case. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aryan-khan-moves-bombay-hc-for-bail-in-cruise-drugs-case-327091

The need to monitor the continuously changing nature of virus and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) must still remain in focus. The existing guidelines (issued on 17th February 2021 with subsequent addendums) for international arrivals in India have been formulated taking a risk-based approach.“In view increasing vaccination coverage across the globe and the changing nature of the pandemic, the existing guidelines for international arrivals in India have been reviewed,” the ministry said.The new document provides protocols to be complied with international travellers as well those to be followed by airlines, points of entry (airports, seaports and land border) for risk profiling of passengers.This Standard Operating Procedure shall be valid from October 25 till further orders. Based on the risk assessment, this document shall be reviewed from time to time, the ministry said.According to the ministry, India has signed agreements for mutual recognition of nationally or WHO recognised COVID-19 vaccines with 11 countries - the UK, France, Germany, Nepal, Belarus, Lebanon, Armenia, Ukraine, Belgium, Hungary and Serbia.Travellers coming from these countries who are fully vaccinated and 15 days have elapsed since completion of Covid-19 vaccination schedule, they shall be allowed to leave the airport and shall self monitor their health for 14 days post arrival, according to the revised guidelines.While planning for travel, all travellers should submit self-declaration form on the online Air Suvidha portal before the scheduled travel and upload a negative Covid-19 RT-PCR report. This test should have been conducted within 72 hours prior to undertaking the journey, according to the guidelines.Each passenger shall also submit a declaration with respect to authenticity of the report and will be liable for criminal prosecution, if found otherwise. If traveller is coming from a country, excluding those covered under these category A  (coming from a country with which India has reciprocal arrangements for mutual acceptance of WHO approved Covid-19 vaccines,) they would be required to undergo the measures such as   submission of sample for post-arrival Covid-19 test at the point of arrival after which they will be allowed to leave the airport, home quarantine for seven days, re-test on the eighth day of arrival in India and if negative, further selfmonitor of their health for next seven days, irrespective of their Covid-19 vaccination status. “Travellers from countries excluding those countries at risk, will be allowed to leave the airport and shall self-monitor their health for 14 days’ post arrival. This is applicable to travellers from all countries including countries with which reciprocal arrangements for mutual acceptance of WHO approved Covid-19 vaccines also exist,” the guidelines stated. The list of countries from where travellers would need to follow additional measures on arrival in India, including post-arrival testing (countries at-risk) are South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand Zimbabwe and countries in Europe, including the UK. Travellers under home quarantine or self-health monitoring, if develop signs and symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 or test positive for Covid-19 on re-testing, they will immediately selfisolate and report to their nearest health facility or call national helpline number (1075) or state helpline number. Thermal screening would be carried out in respect of all the passengers by the health officials present at the airport. The self-declaration form filled online shall be shown to the airport health staff. The passengers found to be symptomatic during screening shall be immediately isolated and taken to medical facility according to health protocol. If tested positive, their contacts shall be identified and managed under laid down protocol.There are countries which have agreement with India on mutual recognition of vaccination certificates of nationally recognised or WHO recognised vaccines. Similarly, there are countries which currently do not have such an agreement with India, but they exempt Indian citizens fully vaccinated with nationally recognised or WHO recognised vaccines. On the basis of reciprocity, the travellers from all such countries which provide quarantine-free entry to Indians are allowed certain relaxations on arrival (Category A countries).  During travel in-flight announcement about COVID-19 including precautionary measures to be followed shall be made at airports and in flights and during transit. During in-flight crew shall ensure that Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed at all times and if any passenger reports symptoms of COVID-19 during flight, he/she shall be isolated as per protocol, the guidelines stated. International travellers arriving through seaports/land ports will also have to undergo the same protocol except that facility for online registration is not available for such passengers currently. Such travellers shall submit the self-declaration form to the concerned authorities of government of India at seaports/land ports on arrival.

21-10-2021||Satya Prakash||Dispel impression that you are dragging your feet, Supreme Court tells UP SIT on Lakhimpur Kheri violence||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 20The Supreme Court on Wednesday told the Uttar Pradesh SIT probing into the Lakhimpur Kheri violence - in which eight people, including four farmers, were killed on October 3 – to record statements of more witnesses before the Magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC to prepare a foolproof case.“We get the impression that you are dragging your feet…Please do the needful to dispel that,” a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice NV Ramana told senior advocate Harish Salve, who represented the UP government.After perusing a status report filed by the Uttar Pradesh government, the Bench repeatedly sought to know the number of accused arrested, the status of their police/judicial custody and how many witnesses’ statements had been recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC, which would make it difficult for them to retract.Salve told the court that so far 10 accused had been arrested in connection with the death of farmers and statements of 40 witnesses before police and four before a magistrate had been recorded. He said four of the accused were in police custody.As the Bench sought to know why the rest of the accused were not in police custody, Salve explained that they were initially in police custody and after their interrogation and recording of statements they were sent to judicial custody.The Bench – which also included Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli – clarified that it wanted the SIT to record statements of witnesses under Section 164 of the CrPC as many of them might be vulnerable to threat."Recording of statements under 164 is different! It’s before a judicial magistrate. Its evidentiary value is far better…Your SIT can recognise who are the most vulnerable witnesses and can be browbeaten.. then why only four witnesses’ statements have been recorded?" the CJI asked Salve who said the process was on and it got delayed because courts were closed for Dussehra vacation.Directing the Uttar Pradesh government to file a further updated status report, the top court posted the matter for October 26.At the very outset of the hearing the Bench took exception to filing of the status report in a sealed cover. “I kept waiting till 1 o’clock at night for the report….,” the CJI said, adding, “There is no need for the report to be filed in a sealed cover.”As the CJI said the report had to be filed at least a day before the scheduled hearing, Salve assured him that the next status report on the SIT probe would be filed by Monday.The top court asked the SIT to bifurcate the two cases – mowing down of farmers by an SUV and the subsequent lynching of BJP workers by an angry mob. Then it went on to seek details of the probe into the farmers’ death. Salve told the Bench that it was difficult to investigate the second case.The Bench - which had on October 8 expressed dissatisfaction over the manner in which Uttar Pradesh Police handled the probe into the “brutal” murders – asked the Uttar Pradesh government to ensure that the victims and witnesses were protected properly.The Bench – which had earlier hinted at handing over the probe to an agency other than the CBI – didn’t talk about changing the probe agency on Wednesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dispel-impression-that-you-are-dragging-your-feet-supreme-court-tells-up-sit-on-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-327058
