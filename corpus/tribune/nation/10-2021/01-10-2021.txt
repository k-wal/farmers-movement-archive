The cut-off for students who will include the subject in their best of four (BFS) marks is 99 per cent.Last year, the cut-off for Psychology (Hons) was 99.5 per cent if the subject was not included in BFS or if a student had scored less than 85 per cent in the subject, while for the others it was 98.5 per cent.To get into BSc (Hons) Computer Science at Hansraj College, a student requires cent per cent marks, a significant increase from last year when 97.25 per cent was needed to get into the course.This year, Hindu College and Ramjas College have kept a perfect score for getting into BA (Honours) Political Science.

Have you yourself seen that CoWIN app recently, it has been updated. Now, you don’t require Aadhaar mandatorily, there are a list of other documents also. Go to the Frequently Asked Questions section of CoWIN and you will now see there are varieties of ID proofs with which you can register,” the Bench said.Kshirsagar said this policy is there but it’s only on paper, but when one visits the vaccination centre, they always insist on Aadhaar.  “Aadhaar card is not the only ID which they are accepting. You can also register with a driving licence, PAN card, voter’s card, ration card and passport. You can verify yourselves, we may keep this matter pending,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-sc-notice-to-centre-on-pil-alleging-insistence-on-aadhaar-for-vaccination-318817

Today people belonging to other ideologies are also joining us. All the students should be vaccinated at the earliest and after that the student union elections should be held,” said Kundan.NSUI national secretary and Delhi in-charge Nitish Gaur said his organisation will help students from all over the country in a big way through this helpline number and the number will be shared on the social media.Former NSUI state president Akshay Lakra said soon more students will also join NSUI after being impressed by the work done by NSUI during the corona period.In a related development, former Delhi unit president of RSS-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) Ram Niwas Bishnoi joined the NSUI.“The ABVP was sitting at home when NSUI was helping the whole country during the corona period. I have joined NSUI influenced by the thoughts of Rahul Gandhi,” he said.However, the ABVP said no one by the name of Ram Niwas Bishnoi was associated with the outfit in any official capacity.“No one by the name of Ram Niwas Bishnoi was currently holding any position in ABVP cadre of Delhi. ABVP’s DU unit president Rohit Sharma and secretary Gunja Singh are actively working for student issues.“It is petty that NSUI, which is unable to connect with students, has come down to falsely claiming the joining of ABVP members.” —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nsui-launches-helpline-number-to-address-students-queries-about-du-admission-process-318815

Not only has nano urea been produced on a large scale today, but we are happy that farmers are adopting it on a large scale since the very beginning. It started production in June and till now we have produced more than 5 million bottles of nano urea. More than one lakh bottles of nano urea are being produced every day”, he said.Mandaviya said many questions and doubts remain in the minds of people regarding conventional spraying of fertilisers and pesticides.“Concerns are also expressed about the potential harm to the health of the sprayers. Drone-spraying will solve these questions and problems. Drones will be able to spray more land in less time. This will save the time of the farmers. The cost of spraying will be less. This will result in financial savings to the farmers. Along with this, the safety of the sprinklers will also be ensured,” he said“Liquid Nano Urea has emerged as a powerful alternative to conventional Urea,” he said, adding that increasing use of liquid nano urea will result in economic savings to the farmers, increase productivity and reduce India’s dependence on urea imports.This will also reduce the subsidy burden on the government and the government will be able to use this savings on other public welfare schemes, he said.Vice President of IFFCO Dilip Bhai Sanghani was also present on the occasion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iffco-conducts-field-trial-of-spraying-of-nano-urea-by-drone-at-gujarats-bhavnagar-318812

Further, the project proponents are required to install reliable and low-cost PM2.5 and PM10 sensors at the C&D project sites,” they said.“This technological shift will not only help the project proponents to self-audit and certify compliance of stipulated dust control measures but will also strengthen monitoring of dust control measures at C&D sites,” they added.The project proponents are also expected to upload the self-declaration on a fortnightly basis.Further, directions have been issued to Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and other State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB) of National Capital Region to strictly monitor compliance of dust mitigation measures by project proponents, officials said.An exhaustive checklist will form the basis for monitoring compliance of dust mitigation measures in the NCR through this online mechanism.The list of dust control/ mitigation measures, include the use of anti-smog guns, water pills, water cannons, hoses, fire hydrants, sprinklers, etc.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/500-square-metres-and-above-construction-projects-in-ncr-will-have-to-register-at-web-portal-318808

He was recently sworn in as Cabinet minister in the UP government and the governor also nominated him as member of the Legislative Council.The party’s state vice-president Gayadin Anuragi joined the Samajwadi Party on Friday.Congress spokesperson Javed Khan said the situation in UP has been deteriorating continuously in the last 32 years and the development of the state has been hampered. He said law and order has completely collapsed and Congress is continuously fighting against the “anti-people” policies of the BJP.Gandhi, who had arrived here on Monday, attended the state election committee meeting of the party on Thursday where it was decided that the first list of candidates for the 2022 UP assembly polls will be released soon.“The meeting of the state election committee was held in which it was decided that the first list of candidates will be released soon,” a senior party leader had said.The Congress had fought the 2017 assembly polls in alliance with the Samajwadi Party and won only seven of the 114 contested seats with a vote share of 6.25 per cent.This time, the Congress has announced that it would fight the upcoming polls without aligning with any big political party. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priyanka-gandhi-to-hold-public-meeting-in-pm-modis-constituency-varanasi-on-october-10-318805

In June 2020, the Defence Ministry had issued orders that extended the delivery period for all existing capital acquisition contracts with the Indian vendors by four months, from March 25, 2020, to July 24, 2020, due to supply chain disruptions.Invoking the FMC came as a relief to the domestic defence industry, whose production schedules have been adversely affected by COVID-19 situation. Foreign vendors in both cases are required to approach the Defence Ministry or respective service headquarters which would consider cases on the basis of the situation prevailing in their respective countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/for-second-time-in-pandemic-vendors-get-more-time-to-deliver-defence-equipment-318804
01-10-2021||New Delhi||SC asks Army not to discharge women officers not considered for Permanent Commission till next hearing||The Supreme Court Friday restrained the Army from discharging 72 Women Short Service Commission Officers (WSSCO) who were not considered for Permanent Commission (PC), till further hearing of the matter and sought a reply within a week on why they were not considered for the service.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna asked the Army to file its reply by next week on a batch of pleas filed by the women officers who alleged that top court’s March 25 ruling was not considered and all 72 of them were rejected from consideration for the PC at one go.“Don’t discharge these women officers from services till further hearing in the matter,” the bench said, while listing a batch of pleas for further hearing on October 8.In its March 25 verdict, the Army was directed by the top court to consider granting PC to the WSSCOs subject to their obtaining 60 per cent marks in the assessment subjects, being found fit on medical criteria as per the August 1, 2020 order of the Army and having received disciplinary and vigilance clearances.At the outset, senior advocate V Mohana, appearing for some of the WSSCOs, said that they have passed the order rejecting the officers at one go on Wednesday without giving reasons.“This court has directed the Army in March to consider all the 72 officers for grant of permanent commissions but they have rejected all of them. This act is against the verdict of the top court and the order be set aside,” she said.The bench asked Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain, appearing for the Centre, what is happening in this matter. Jain said that as per his understanding there cannot be one reason for rejecting all of the officers at one go but there has to be 72 reasons for rejecting them and he along with senior advocate R Balasubrmanian have sought information from the concerned department and all the relevant document to examine the factual matrix.He sought time of two weeks to come back to the court with all the relevant details.Mohana said that they have scored over 60 per cent marks in their subjects, they were found to be medically fit and no disciplinary and vigilance inquiry was pending against them as per the three criteria listed by the top court in its verdict.“There is no justification that all of these women officers were not considered at one go. This is in clear breach of the top court’s verdict,” she said.Senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, also appearing for women officers, said that these women have cleared all the three criteria laid down by this court and now they will be discharged from services.Balasubramanian said that as per his knowledge that out of this batch of 72 officers only 25 will be released in November and not before that and hence the court may grant some time to file their replies in the matter.Senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi, also appearing for one of the WSSCOs, said that this order of the Army was in teeth of the top court’s verdict and tantamount to breach of the conditions laid down by this court.The bench said it will be taking up this matter for further hearing on October 8.On March 25, the top court had said that the evaluation criteria set by the Army for granting permanent commission to women SSC officers constituted “systemic discrimination” which has caused an economic and psychological harm and an “affront to their dignity”.The apex court said the administrative requirement imposed by the Army while considering the case of WSSCOs for PC, of benchmarking them with the officers lowest in merit in the corresponding male batch, is “arbitrary and irrational”.It had said this administrative requirement “shall not be enforced” while implementing the last year’s verdict of the top court which had directed that women officers in the Army be granted PC.It had directed that all women officers, who have fulfilled the cut-off grade of 60 per cent in the Special No 5 Selection Board held in September last year, shall be entitled to grant of PC subject to their meeting medical criteria prescribed by the general instructions dated August 1, 2020, and receiving disciplinary and vigilance clearance.It had said that medical criteria stipulated in the general instructions shall be applied at the following points of time—at the time of fifth year of service or at the time of tenth year of service, as the case may be.“In case the officer has failed to meet the medical criterion for the grant of PC at any of these points in time, the WSSCO will not be entitled to the grant of PC,” it had said.The top court had clarified that a WSSCO, who was in the temporary low medical category (TLMC) in the fifth or tenth year of service and subsequently met the SHAPE-1 criterion after the one-year period of stabilization, would also be eligible for grant of PC. On February 17 last year, in a landmark verdict, the top court had directed that women officers in the Army be granted permanent commission, rejecting the Centre’s stand of their physiological limitations as being based on “sex stereotypes” and “gender discrimination against women”.The apex court had directed that within three months, all serving SSC women officers have to be considered for PCs irrespective of them having crossed 14 years or, as the case may be, 20 years of service. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-army-not-to-discharge-women-officers-not-considered-for-permanent-commission-till-next-hearing-318803

So, obviously, there’s that step that needs the approval process, and then our Therapeutic Goods Administration will look at it...”     The Australian PMO said the government will finalise in the coming weeks the processes for people to be able to show their vaccination status if they have had a TGA recognised vaccine.

01-10-2021||New Delhi||Questioning time-tested leadership style in isolation from workers’ opinion ‘worrying’: Khurshid||With P Chidambaram expressing helplessness over lack of “meaningful conversations” within the Congress, party colleague Salman Khurshid on Friday said he had hoped the discussions the former finance minister speaks of might have been led by him and called for a dialogue between the leaders of the party.In an apparent swipe at the ‘Group of 23’ leaders and Kapil Sibal’s remarks questioning the party’s functioning amid a raging feud in the Congress, Khurshid, known to be close to the Gandhi family, said questioning time tested leadership style and substance in isolation from the popular prevailing opinion of ground-level workers, despite strong opinion amongst sundry leaders, is “very worrying”.Weighing in on the internal bickering within the Congress following Navjot Singh Sidhu’s resignation as the party’s Punjab unit chief, Khurshid, in a long Facebook post, said just “as we saw” a ray of hope in the appointment of the new chief minister of Punjab “things tumbled out of control”.“The new order astutely carved out of the crisis of confidence at several levels was challenged from within before the bonhomie pictures had become dated in terms of hours, not days. We continue to hope and pray that the disagreements will settle down in the interest of the party that deserves to win another term,” he said, referring to the developments in Punjab.The former Union minister also expressed his views over the protests outside Sibal’s house after he demanded that an immediate meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) be convened and wondered who in the party was taking decisions in the absence of a full-time president.In his post, Khurshid singled out Chidambaram’s tweet in which he had expressed hurt and helplessness over the protests outside Sibal’s house.“I feel helpless when we cannot start meaningful conversations within party forums. I also feel hurt and helpless when I see pictures of Congress workers raising slogans outside the residence of a colleague and MP,” Chidambaram tweeted on Thursday.The safe harbour to which one can withdraw seems to be silence, he had said.One cannot escape noting the sadness and helplessness of the tweet by Chidambaram, not one to be at a loss for ideas and expression in the toughest of situations, Khurshid said.“I had indeed hoped that the conversations he speaks of might have been led by him. Be that as it may, and without giving up on hope, one has to empathise with his rejection of the manner of protests that greeted some statements that the protesters found unsavoury. But to forgive my reiteration, once again it is a matter of pigeons coming home to roost,” Khurshid said.“Good or bad, over the past we have encouraged or condoned certain conduct today being described as hooliganism as opposed to sycophantic conduct,” he said.“But of course Mr Chidambaram let us all talk, not just talk but talk with each other,” Khurshid added.Addressing Chidambaram, Khurshid said it would not serve to seek silence and certainly not by someone with eloquence and intellect like yours.“However, it would be fair that we speak with the young workers who expressed their ire in a manner seemingly unbecoming, but as I said, frequently condoned or encouraged when we were not the targets,” he said.Khurshid said curiously the prevailing norm in national politics seems to be that unless such demonstration of disquiet is publicly expressed political entities are dismissed as ineffective and invisible.“If we are concerned about fixing decision making in our party we can surely fix communications with ordinary workers. They are the ones who have made us what we are. Without them we are just names. Perhaps they will, if encouraged to speak up, tell us that we are the mistakes. In other words, there may be a lot to say about others in the party but perhaps we need to reflect on ourselves a bit as well,” he said.In this moment of “trial and tribulation”, Khurshid said, Congress leaders’ paramount obligation is to restore faith in ourselves and each other.“Our leaders have led us from the front and for decades together ensured that we have the comfort of being in power. They believe that they get their strength and power from the thousands of workers and ordinary folk. Today they face the crisis with confidence because at the end of the day it is the workers’ devotion that sustains them,” he said.Congress is a way of life and a matter of faith for millions of workers, he said.“If there is a sense amongst some people that the way of life should change they must account for those who do not wish to leave the path shown to them by their ancestors. We hope to find the end of the rainbow along this very road. What conversation can we have with those who cannot see the colours of the rainbow anymore,” Khurshid said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/questioning-time-tested-leadership-style-in-isolation-from-workers-opinion-worrying-khurshid-318794

State unit president Navjot Singh Sidhu had also put in his papers recently.Asked about Anuragi leaving the party, Congress spokesperson Ashok Singh said, “Who leaves the party at a time of struggle? History doesn’t forgive such people. We are not in power for 30 years in the state, but under the leadership of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, we are fighting.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-up-unit-vice-president-gayadeen-anuragi-crosses-over-to-sp-318786

Twitter can't decide||After butter chicken golgappas, the latest food to outrage Twitter is the normally innocuous idli—but this one on an ice-cream stick.This version of idli, a South Indian rice dumpling that’s now omnipresent in India, is, except for seemingly offending stick, is really quite the same and comes with the standard accompaniments—‘sambhar’ and ‘chutney’.It's still unknown who served it up—news portal News Minute, in fact, quoted the manager of a Bengaluru restaurant, Colombo Idli House, which is widely attributed to have been behind what some see as an abomination, as denying ever having such a dish on its menu. Regardless, although it hasn’t offended quite as many people as the butter chicken golgappas—which met with near-universal revulsion—it has spurred a heated debate on Twitter."Bengaluru, India’s innovation capital can’t stop its creativity from manifesting itself in the most unexpected areas… Idli on a stick—sambhar & chutney as dips…Those in favour, those against," business magnate Anand Mahindra said.  Bengaluru, India’s innovation capital can’t stop its creativity from manifesting itself in the most unexpected areas… Idli on a stick—sambhar & chutney as dips…Those in favour, those against?? pic.twitter.com/zted3dQRfL  There were of course the standard stock of the people wondering why anyone would do it.

01-10-2021||Lucknow||Extortion racket link behind killing of Kanpur businessman: Akhilesh Yadav||Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav attacked the Uttar Pradesh government on Friday over the death of a Kanpur businessman in a police raid, claiming that the case is linked to an extortion racket and “someone” is trying to save himself.Businessman Manish Gupta died in a Gorakhpur hotel during the raid late on Monday night, prompting authorities to suspend six policemen and book them for murder. The policemen are absconding.“No policeman has been arrested in the Manish Gupta murder case. This shows that they did not escape themselves but were made to escape. Actually, someone is not saving the accused but saving himself as its strings are linked to the ‘vasooli tantra’ (extortion racket),” Yadav said in a tweet in Hindi.“’Zero-tolerance’ is also a BJP jumla (rhetoric),” he said, in an apparent reference to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s assertion that the state has zero-tolerance towards crime and corruption.Referring to the incidents of violence during the panchayat elections, Yadav told a press conference that as the BJP had used officials of the administration during the polls for “political reasons”, its government is now defending them.“A top official posted in Gorakhpur is relative of a BJP leader,” he said when asked about a viral video in which the Gorakhpur district magistrate and senior superintendent of police are seen allegedly pressuring Gupta’s family not to lodge an FIR.“When you use the administration’s officials for political reasons, how can you take action against them when they do anything wrong,” Yadav said.He said this is not the first incident of police atrocity. Earlier, such incidents have taken place in Lucknow, Jhansi and other parts of the state, the Samajwadi Party (SP) leader said.“The National Human Rights Commission has served maximum number of notices to the state,” he said. On the accused policemen being at large, Yadav said why is this “damdar” (strong) government not apprehending these policemen.“An IPS is also absconding in the state. Such people have been made to abscond by the government, which is helping them,” he alleged.On being asked about the rise in petrol and diesel prices, Yadav said: “Why are they not being brought under the Goods and Services Tax (GST). The BJP has majority in the GST Council as it has governments in states. Why it is not taking a decision”.             About use of ballot in elections, Yadav said, “Bring a SP government, and remove electronic voting machines”.“The panchyat polls were held using ballot papers and SP won the majority of seats. In the US also ballot paper is being used,” he said.On the 2022 assembly polls, Yadav said that it is not the just the fight of the SP but “it is the fight to save the country and the Constitution”, adding that BJP was humiliating all the sections of society by its behaviour.He said that even good officers in the state cannot work in the present regime and they were “forced to lie” under government pressure. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/extortion-racket-link-behind-killing-of-kanpur-businessman-akhilesh-yadav-318767
01-10-2021||New Delhi||Developments in Afghanistan will have very, very significant consequences: Jaishankar||India was not taken into confidence on various aspects of the Doha deal inked between the US and the Taliban last year and the latest developments in Afghanistan will have “very, very significant consequences” for the region and beyond, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said.He said that the key concerns for India at this juncture included whether Afghanistan would have an inclusive government and that Afghan soil was not used for terrorism against other states and the rest of the world.Speaking virtually at the annual leadership summit of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum on Thursday, Jaishankar suggested that India was in no hurry to deliberate on giving any recognition to the new dispensation in Kabul.In an interactive session with former American ambassador Frank Wisner, the External Affairs Minister said the Quad or Quadrilateral coalition comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan is not against any country and it should not be seen as some kind of "ganging up" and a negatively driven initiative.India and the US are on the same page on many issues relating to the recent developments in Afghanistan including apprehensions about the possible use of Afghan soil for terrorism."I think, to some degree, we would all be justified in having levels of concern and to some degree, I think the jury's still out. When I say levels of concern, you know, there were commitments which were made by the Taliban, at Doha, I mean, the US knows that best I mean, we were not taken into confidence on various aspects of that," he said."So whatever, whether deal which was struck in Doha, I mean, one has a broad sense. But beyond that, you know, are we going to see an inclusive government? Are we going to see respect for the rights of women, children, minorities?" he asked."Most important are we going to see an Afghanistan whose soil is not used for terrorism against other states and the rest of the world, I think, these are our concerns," Jaishankar added.The Doha deal was signed between the US and the Taliban in February last year in which the US promised to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan while the Taliban committed to several conditions including ending violence.Jaishankar said what had happened in Afghanistan, is going to "have very, very significant consequences for all of us, and we are so close to the region".He said that the key concerns were captured by a UN Security Council resolution in August and that how those questions are addressed today is still an open question, which is why "I said the jury is still out"."If you ask me is this the time to draw sharp conclusions, I would sort of take my time and study this with a certain degree of deliberation, because as I said, a lot of this, whatever understandings, there have been, many of these are not known to the entire international community," he added.To another question on how India and the US looked at the situation in Afghanistan, Jaishankar said both sides are on a similar page, at a principle level on many of the issues, particularly on possible usage of Afghan soil for terrorism.

However, the petition had some defects and was declared “infructuous” for not following the required procedures, Akhtar said.This clearly goes on to show that the present petition is an orchestrated tactic to delay the proceedings pending, it added.The matter has been posted for hearing on October 18.Akhtar (76) had filed the complaint in the court in November last year, claiming that Ranaut had made defamatory statements against him in a television interview, which allegedly damaged his reputation.In his complaint, Akhtar claimed that Ranaut dragged his name during an interview while referring to a ‘coterie’ existing in Bollywood, following the alleged suicide committed by actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June last year.Ranaut has also moved a counter-complaint in the court against Akhtar for alleged “extortion and criminal intimidation” before the metropolitan magistrate court.The actor in her complaint against Akhtar said following her public dispute with her co-star, the lyricist had called her and her sister Rangoli Chandel to his house with “malafide intentions and ulterior motives and then criminally intimidated and threatened” her.As per the complaint, Akhtar had forced Ranaut to tender a written apology to her co-star. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kangana-ranauts-plea-for-defamation-case-transfer-devoid-of-merit-javed-akhtar-tells-court-calls-it-her-delay-tactic-318756
01-10-2021||Jaipur||Congress leader Digvijaya Singh demands judicial inquiry into drug haul from Gujarat port||Veteran Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Friday demanded a judicial inquiry into the 3,000 kg heroin valued at Rs 21,000 crore seized recently at a port in Gujarat, which was shipped from Iran.Showing a video at a press conference here having names of people allegedly having connection with the BJP and involvement in drug smuggling, Singh also wanted the Centre to reveal what action was taken against them under provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.The former Madhya Pradesh chief minister also said a probe into the case related to the drug seizure has been handed over to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) but trusting the organisation is difficult as it has worked to get acquitted every individual who had connections with the BJP."We do not trust the NIA. The agency under Modi-Shah rule has worked to get acquitted every individual who had connection with the BJP and were involved in terrorist activities," Singh told reporters at the press conference.He further said, "Such advocates are posted at NIA who instead of prosecution argue for their acquittal. We demanded that the matter of seized drugs should be probed by a sitting or retired Supreme Court judge."                  The former Congress national general secretary was here on the directions of AICC to raise the issue, Congress state president Govind Singh Dotasra said.Singh said drug smuggling is a more serious issue than terrorism as it destroys the youth of the country.He said a similar consignment of 25,000 kg heroin was seized in June this year in Gujarat.The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) recently seized almost 3,000 kg of heroin. After the seizure, the probe was widened to Andhra Pradesh, as one Vijaywada-based couple had imported the consignment; Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and other places.One Aashi Trading Company was identified as the importing firm and is alleged to be run by M Sudhakar and his wife, G Durga Purna Vaishali. Both were arrested from Chennai and taken into custody for interrogation.The former MP CM said demonetisation of high value currency notes was done to stop terrorism, corruption and fake currencies but surprisingly cash liquidity in the country has increased.He said there was Rs 17.8 lakh crore currency in September 2016, which is presently Rs 26.7 lakh crore as per RBI figures. The report of an SIT constituted to bring back black money is yet to be tabled, he added.

But there is no concrete information yet,” he said.“Being a government officer, there are restrictions on travelling abroad. You can’t leave the country without the government permission. Still if he has left, it is not good,” Walse Patil added.He said the state government was in touch with the Centre to find Singh, who had levelled allegations of bribery against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are probing the allegations made against Deshmukh by the senior IPS officer.Days after he was shunted out as Mumbai police commissioner and transferred to the Home Guards in March this year, Singh had claimed in a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray that Deshmukh used to ask police officers to collect money from restaurant and bar owners in Mumbai.The state government had formed a one-member commission of Justice Kailash Uttamchand Chandiwal (retd) to conduct a probe into the corruption allegations levelled by Singh. The commission had issued summons to Singh multiple times to appear before it, but he failed to do so. After that, the panel had also issued a bailable warrant against him.Singh has been booked in multiple cases of extortion. He is also facing a case under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act registered in April this year on a complaint lodged by a police inspector.

He also said all the restrictions imposed by the court last year will remain the same.The Advocate General, who appeared for the state, said the state government has no objections if the court imposes these kinds of restrictions for the greater benefit of the people.Last year the division bench of the high court comprising Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Arijit Banerjee, hearing a public interest litigation filed by the same person, said that no visitors would be allowed to enter the marquees.For small pandals, barricades will have to be put up five metres from the entrance, while for the bigger ones, the distance has to be 10 metres, the court had ordered.There should be no-entry boards at the barricades, it had said.The court also had ordered that only 15 to 25 persons belonging to the organising committees will be allowed to enter the pandals.The court had also said that the organisers will have to distribute masks and sanitisers to the visitors, do awareness campaigns and make continuous announcements so that the people get aware of the impending threat of the disease.This year all these restrictions will remain active during the Durga Puja and Kali Puja celebration.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/visitors-will-not-be-allowed-inside-puja-pandals-calcutta-hc-318749

01-10-2021||New Delhi||Tata Sons top bidder for Air India: Sources||Tata Sons has emerged as the top bidder for the takeover of debt-laden state-run airline Air India but the bid is yet to be approved by a group of ministers headed by Home Minister Amit Shah, sources said.Financial bids put in by the salt-to-software conglomerate and SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh were opened a few days back and were vetted by the Core Group of Secretaries on Disinvestment headed by the Cabinet Secretary on Wednesday, sources with knowledge of the matter said.The bids were evaluated against the reserve price set and Tatas emerged as the highest bidder, they said, adding this will now have to be placed before the committee of ministers on Air India privatisation led by Shah.The other members of the panel called Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) are Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Civil Aviation Minster Jyotiraditya Scindia.The finance ministry and Tata Sons declined to comment on the matter.Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary to the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) -- the government department responsible for privatisation—in a tweet said the Centre has so far not approved any financial bid for Air India.“Media reports indicating approval of financial bids by Government of India in the AI disinvestment case are incorrect. Media will be informed of the Government’s decision as and when it is taken,” he tweeted.Post the submission of bids on September 15, security clearance of the bidders was obtained, following which their financial bids were opened by the Core group of Secretaries on disinvestment (CGD).If its bid is accepted by AISAM, Tatas will take over the national carrier they once founded.Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy (JRD) Tata founded the airline in 1932. It was called Tata Airlines then.In 1946, the aviation division of Tata Sons was listed as Air India and in 1948, Air India International was launched with flights to Europe.The international service was among the first public-private partnerships in India, with the government holding 49 per cent, the Tatas keeping 25 per cent and the public owning the rest.In 1953, Air India was nationalised.The government is seeking to sell 100 per cent of its stake in the state-owned national airline, including Air India’s 100 per cent shareholding in AI Express Ltd and 50 per cent in Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd.The stake sale process, which began in January 2020, faced delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2021, the government asked potential bidders to put in financial bids.September 15 was the last day for putting in financial bids.Tata Group was among the multiple entities that had put in an initial expression of interest (EoI) in December 2020 for buying the Maharaja.With previous attempts since 2017 failing to get any significant interest and after receiving feedback from potential investors, the government had in October last year sweetened the EoI clause relating to the transfer of Air India’s debt to the new investor, giving bidders flexibility to decide on the quantum of humongous debt they want to absorb.As per the Air India EoI floated by DIPAM in January 2020, of the airline’s total debt of Rs 60,074 crore as of March 31, 2019, the buyer would be required to absorb Rs 23,286.5 crore.The rest would be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), a special purpose vehicle.Air India has been in losses ever since its merger with domestic operator Indian Airlines in 2007.The airline will give the successful bidder control of 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports, as well as 900 slots at airports overseas.Besides, the bidder would get 100 per cent of the low-cost arm Air India Express and 50 per cent of AISATS, which provides cargo and ground handling services at major Indian airports.

If anyone has an issue with us, we are ready to resolve it through talks and understanding,” said the Taliban’s Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Abdul Ghani Biradar in a statement on Friday.Seeking to address global anxieties on Afghanistan becoming a crucible for radical extremism, Baradar said, “We neither intend nor have the policy to harm others.”A day earlier, Foreign Minister Maulvi Amir Khan Muttaqi replied to concerns of a Pashtun-dominated government by assuring them that the Taliban wanted to “open a new political chapter in good governance at home and in regional and global relations”. He was addressing mostly ambassadors in Kabul at a luncheon.The Taliban has inducted no woman but three traders from Uzbek, Hazara and Tajik (Panjshir) ethnicities as deputy ministers in a cabinet expansion. The world largely saw the Taliban’s signal of inclusiveness as inadequate.In a reference to its claims to be Afghanistan’s legitimate government, Muttaqi said, “The Kabul Administration exists no more and IEA has all components of a government.”The Taliban has already applied to the UN for the nomination of its representative as the Afghan Permanent Representative at New York.So far, only a small group of countries and UN aid organisations have interacted with the Taliban. These include the Ambassador of Turkmenistan in Kabul Hoja Ofzov with whom Muttaqi discussed TAPI projects in detail, said Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen.Significantly for India, which is interested in Afghanistan’s mineral deposits, the Taliban have highlighted its meetings with traders and industrialists associated with the mining sector. The previous regime had allocated three iron ore mines in Bamyan district to a SAIL-led consortium while China was allocated a copper mine near Kabul. China has hosted Taliban leaders in Beijing and its Ambassador in Kabul Wang Yu frequently interacts with the top leadership.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/taliban-leaders-discuss-tapi-gas-pipeline-mining-projects-318727

There was communal violence in the area in 2018, which had paralysed life in Shillong for weeks.Gurjit Singh, Harijan Panchayat Committee chief, said handing over the report at this juncture was violation of the Meghalaya High Court order pronounced on April 9 this year. “We will again have to move the HC as the committee is indifferent to the court’s order,” Gurjit told The Tribune over phone from Shillong.He also demanded that the Meghalaya Government provide the Harijan Panchayat a copy of the report as the Sikhs were stakeholders in the matter.According to the panchayat committee, the government panel was appointed for examination of records and for making recommendations regarding relocation of the Sikhs. “But the panel went beyond its mandate and has taken decisions regarding evicting the Harijan Colony residents,” it said.In the April 9 order, Justice Ranjit More acknowledged the fear of panchayat committee as “justified” and asked for status quo to be maintained with regard to Harijan Colony.The CM refused to divulge the content of the report. “It will be discussed by the Cabinet,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/resisting-relocation-shillong-sikhs-allege-hc-order-violated-318450

It and posted the matter for further hearing on October 4.“The redressal of problems can be through judicial forum, agitation or through parliamentary debates. But how can the highways be blocked and this is happening perpetually. Where does this end?” a Bench led by Justice SK Kaul asked.“We may lay down a law but how to implement the law is your (the government’s) business. The court can’t implement it. It is the executive which has to implement it,” it noted while hearing a petition filed by Monicca Agarwal, a women resident of Noida, on the issue.Agarwal — a single parent with some medical issues — alleged that due to blockade of roads by the agitating farmers, travelling between Noida and Delhi was taking two hours instead of the usual 20 minutes and that it had become a nightmare to commute.Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the top court had on October 7, 2020, ruled that roads and public spaces couldn’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent had to be in designated places alone.On Thursday, it allowed the Centre to file a formal application to make farmer unions a party to the plea seeking removal of road blockade on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border at UP Gate here and posted the matter for further hearing on October 4.“When we lay down the law, you will say it is encroachment and we trespassed into the domain of the executive. This has ramifications but there are also grievances which need to be addressed. This cannot be a perpetual problem,” the Bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who said when it was invited, it couldn’t be termed encroachment.Earlier, Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj told the court that the government had convened a meeting with protesting farmers, the details of which were there in the affidavit.Mehta said a three-member committee was formed at the highest level to address farmers’ grievances but their representatives refused to join talks.At Mehta’s request, the court allowed him to file an application to make farmers’ unions a party to the case. Mehta said the Centre would file the application by Friday.Earlier, the Haryana Government had told the SC that it was making “sincere” efforts to remove the blockade.The Uttar Pradesh Government had also filed a similar affidavit stating it was making all efforts to convince farmers that their act of blocking roads was causing grave inconvenience to commuters.The SC had on August 23 asked the Centre and governments of UP and Haryana to find a solution to the blockade of roads.

Six-time Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh had to bite the dust as he suffered defeat at the hands of Ram Lal Thakur who won as the Himachal Congress candidate after his exit from the Congress. The nine-time MLA later returned to the Congress.As such, the electorate of Jubbal-Kotkhai, considered a Congress bastion, chose a former Chief Minister as their MLA over the sitting CM Virbhadra Singh. This is the only Assembly election besides one Lok Sabha election that Virbhadra lost in his entire political career spanning six decades.Though both BJP and Congress are yet to finalise their candidates, as of now Jubbal-Kotkhai seems to be heading to be a fight for political supremacy between the families of Chief Minister Ram Lal Thakur and former BJP minister Narinder Bragta. The seat fell vacant due to the demise of Bragta. The BJP is hoping to cash in on the sympathy factor as the ruling party is likely to field Chetan Bragta, son of the former minister. In all probability, the Congress too is likely to field Rohit Thakur, grandson of Ram Lal Thakur. Rohit had lost the 2017 election to Bragta. Rohit has remained an MLA twice and was also Chief Parliamentary Secretary in the Congress regime headed by Virbhadra.Out of the 13 elections held here, the Congress has won 10 times while the BJP twice, with Bragta being victorious on both occasions. In the 1990 Assembly polls, the seat was won by Ram Lal Thakur as the Himachal Congress candidate.While the picture is fairly clear in the Congress as Rohit remains the frontrunner without any strong opposition, in the BJP there are murmurs of resentment at Bragta’s son Chetan being fielded.The threat of undercutting looms large with many local BJP leaders opposing dynastic rule.The fear of undercutting by the Virbhadra camp is also giving sleepless nights to Rohit’s supporters. With Virbhadra and Rohit’s father having remained archrivals, the antagonism between the two families still continues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/himachal-assembly-bypoll-jubbal-kotkhai-may-see-battle-between-scions-318447
