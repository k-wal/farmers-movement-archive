She died allegedly after police personnel broke open the door of her hut during a search operation injuring her fatally on the night of October 20.The autopsy report revealed that the elderly woman died of severe injuries including those on the head, Deputy Commissioner Madhvi Mishra said.A three-member medical board conducted the post-mortem examination in presence of a magistrate and the report was submitted to the deputy commissioner on Saturday.Mishra said it was sent to the police authorities for further legal action.The woman’s family members filed a complaint at Rajrappa police station against cops, the deputy commissioner said.Ramgarh SP Prabhat Kumar on Saturday said a probe has been ordered into the death of Malo Devi and assured her family of lawful action against persons who will be found guilty.Malo Devi was injured when the police broke open the door as she was near it, her family said.The effigy of the mythical 10-headed king of Lanka was burnt in the village on October 16 in defiance of the protocol of the state government to stop the spread of Covid-19. Violence erupted when policemen tried to stop the ritual.Deputy Superintendent of Police Sanjiv Kumar Mishra and Rajrappa police station in-charge Vipin Kumar had suffered injuries in the violence, which led to massive night search operation by cops to apprehend the culprits.Altogether 26 villagers were arrested so far in connection with the violence, police said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jharkhand-woman-died-due-to-multiple-injuries-during-police-search-autopsy-report-329047
24-10-2021||Tawang (Arunachal Pradesh)||China does not have any right in choosing next Dalai Lama: Head of Tawang monastery||China has no authority at all to get involved in choosing the next Dalai Lama as it does not believe in religion and the succession plan is entirely a spiritual matter and not a political issue for the Tibetan people, the head of the Tawang monastery in Arunachal Pradesh has said.Gyangbung Rinpoche, the Abbot of the nearly 350-year-old monastery near India’s border with China, also said that it is important to counter Beijing’s “policy of expansionism” and New Delhi must maintain a strict vigil over the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with that country, in an oblique reference to the eastern Ladakh standoff.Referring to China’s aggressive posturing along the LAC, Rinpoche said though India believes in peace and prosperity, its approach in dealing with such belligerence has to be based on the ground reality.“It is important to counter China’s growing assertiveness. It is necessary for India to keep a strict vigil over the border (with China),” he told PTI in an interview.The head of the second largest monastery in the world after the Potala Palace in Tibet’s Lhasa said only the current Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people have the right to decide about the successor to the Tibetan spiritual leader and China has no role to play in the matter.“The Chinese government does not believe in religion. How can a government that does not believe in religion decide the next Dalai Lama. The succession plan is a matter of religion and faith; it is not a political issue,” Rinpoche said.“China does not have any right to even get involved in the process of choosing the next Dalai Lama. Only the current Dalai Lama and his followers have the right to decide on the issue,” he said.The comments by the Abbot of the monastery that is located in a region claimed by China came amid strain in ties between the two countries following the eastern Ladakh border standoff. India maintains that its state of Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of the country.Rinpoche said the Tibetan people will never accept any decision on the issue by China and that Beijing’s attempt to get involved is part of efforts to “capture” the Tibetan heritage and “hold control” over the Tibetan people.“It will be difficult for China to win the hearts of the people of Tibet. China is tightly controlling Tibet. The authorities do not even allow people from outside to meet Tibetans. There are so many restrictions. It is important that countries like India support the Tibetans,” he said.The issue of a successor to the 14th Dalai Lama, who has been living in exile in Dharamshala in India since 1959, gained traction as he turned 86 in July. The Dalai Lama is believed to be a living Buddha who is reincarnated after his death.China has been insisting that the selection of the next Dalai Lama has to be decided within Chinese territory and that it has to have a say in the matter.Referring to China’s aggressive posturing along the LAC, Rinpoche said, “India believes in peace and prosperity. India does not like to fight or to have hatred against any country. India believes in living in peace with the countries which share a border with it.” “India needs to maintain a strict vigil over the border. Though India believes in peace and prosperity, its approach has to be based on the ground reality. Regions like Tawang and Ladakh are part of India,” he said.The religious leader said it is important to counter China’s policy of expansionism.The monastery headed by Rinpoche is located in Tawang at an altitude of around 9,000 feet, a region that has significant political, spiritual and strategic dimensions       After a failed anti-Chinese uprising in 1959, the 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet and came to India where he set up a government-in-exile.Beijing has in the past accused the Dalai Lama of indulging in “separatist” activities and trying to split Tibet and considers him as a divisive figure.However, the Tibetan spiritual leader has insisted that he is not seeking independence but “genuine autonomy for all Tibetans living in the three traditional provinces of Tibet” under the “Middle-Way approach”.The Chinese government officials and the Dalai Lama or his representatives have not met for formal negotiations since 2010. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-does-not-have-any-right-in-choosing-next-dalai-lama-head-of-tawang-monastery-329038
24-10-2021||Vijay Mohan||Freak weather results in significant rain surplus over North India||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 24Many parts of North India, including Punjab, Haryana and Himachal, witnessed unusually heavy downpour and hail over the past 24 hours, resulting in not only a dip in temperature but also in the cumulative rainfall for the month of October being significantly above normal.From October 1 to October 24, rain in Punjab was 264 per cent above the long period average for this period, while it was above normal by 136 percent in Haryana and by 69 per cent in Himachal Pradesh.According to data compiled by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) Punjab received 29.5 mm rain during the aforementioned period against the normal of 8.1 mm. Haryana and Himachal received 21.3 mm and 41 mm rain, respectively, against the normal of 9 mm and 24.2 mm, respectively.The unseasonal rains over the past week have been caused by a Western Disturbance, weather officials said. Consequently, the day temperatures came down by a few degrees, which, coupled by snow in the upper reaches, heralded the onset of winters.While most of Punjab witnessed surplus rain during this month, the districts of Patiala, SAS Nagar, Rupnagar and Moga remained largely dry, with the deficiency being as high as minus 89 per cent.Similarly, in Haryana most areas received good rains barring the horizontal belt comprising Sirsa, Fatehbad, Jind and Panipat, where the shortfall ranged up to minus 80 percent.In the hill state of Himachal Pradesh, the source of several rivers as well as tributaries of the Sutlej, rains fared poorly in five districts – Chamba, Hamirpur, Mandi, Bilaspur, Una and Solan.The fresh spell of rain over the past few days comes in the wake of an erratic and extended monsoon, which had finally withdrawn from north India on October 8. In 2021, monsoon was surplus by 31.3 percent in Haryana, but below the long-period average by 4.2 per cent in Punjab and 9.4 per cent in Himachal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/freak-weather-results-in-significant-rain-surplus-over-north-india-329032
24-10-2021||New Delhi||‘Tax dacoity’: Congress slams govt over rising fuel prices||The Congress on Sunday slammed the Centre over rising fuel prices, with former party chief Rahul Gandhi alleging that the “tax dacoity” on petrol prices is rising and there would be some respite from it if elections take place somewhere.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also attacked the Centre over rising prices of petrol and diesel, alleging that the Narendra Modi government has created records in “giving trouble” to people.Taking to Twitter, the Congress general secretary tagged a media report which said this year, petrol prices have increased by a record Rs 23.53.“Modi ji’s government has made big records in giving trouble to the public. Highest unemployment: in Modi government. Government properties being sold: in Modi government. Petrol rates increased the most in a year: in Modi government,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.Taking a swipe at the government, Rahul Gandhi, in a tweet in Hindi, said, “Tax dacoity over petrol prices is rising. There would be some respite from it if elections take place somewhere.”        He used the hashtag ‘TaxExtortion’ with his tweet.Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram also took a swipe at the government, saying PM Modi led his ministers in celebrating 100 crore vaccinations and should also lead by example in celebrating other centenaries—petrol crossed Rs 100 per litre a few weeks ago and now diesel has crossed Rs 100 per litre.When a gas cylinder crosses Rs 1,000 per cylinder, there will be another opportunity to celebrate, Chidambaram said.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tagged the same media report shared by Priyanka Gandhi and tweeted, “Achche Din” (good days).Petrol and diesel prices on Sunday were hiked for the fifth straight day by 35 paise per litre each, pushing pump rates to a new high across the country.The price of petrol in Delhi rose to its highest-ever level of Rs 107.59 a litre and Rs 113.46 per litre in Mumbai, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.In Mumbai, diesel now comes for Rs 104.38 a litre, while in Delhi, it costs Rs 96.32 per litre.

24-10-2021||Chennai||Matchbox to cost Rs 2 from December 1, consumers to get more matchsticks||Effective December 1, the price of a matchbox would be Rs 2 from the present Rs 1 and this is in view of a rise in production cost, triggered by an increase in price of raw materials, the industry body said on Sunday.Consumers would, however, get more matchsticks in a box when they buy it at Rs 2, up from 36 matchsticks to 50 per box.The proposed price increase comes after a gap of 14 years, Secretary of the National Small Matchbox Manufacturers Association, V S Sethurathinam said.The prices of raw materials have increased leading to a jump in cost of production, he said, adding “we have no other option but to increase the selling (Maximum Retail Price) price.” The prices of all the 14 key raw materials have increased. “A kilo of red phosphorous has increased from Rs 410 to Rs 850, wax from Rs 72 to Rs 85, pottasium chlorate Rs 68 to Rs 80, splints (sticks) from Rs 42 to Rs 48. Outer box Rs 42 to Rs 55 and inner box from Rs 38 to Rs 48. Like this, the price of all raw materials have increased manifold,” he told PTI.“The rise in fuel prices is also a factor. It has led to an increase in transportation cost.” Hence, from December 1, the price of a matchbox would be increased to Rs 2 (MRP) from the present Rs 1, he said.“After about six months we may review the situation. In 2007, the price was increased from fifty paisa to Rs 1 per matchbox.” However, Sethurathinam said the count of matchsticks in a matchbox would be increased to 50 from the present 36. “When you pay Rs 2, you will get 50 matchsticks.”The price increase would help tackle the situation that has arisen due to the rise in production cost and the decision to go for a hike was taken after discussions with all associations, he said.About 5 lakh people are dependent on the matchbox industry directly and indirectly and 90 per cent of the workforce is women, he said.Tamil Nadu is a leading manufacturer of matchboxes and Kovilpatti, Sattur, Sivakasi, Thiurthangal, Ettayapuram, Kazhugumalai, Sankarankoil, Gudiyattam and Kaveripakkam are the major production centres.Approximately, there are 1,000 matchbox units which include small and medium sized matchbox manufacturers as well.

24-10-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi to visit Italy, UK from Oct 29 to Nov 2 for G-20, COP-26 summits||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to pitch for a united global approach in dealing with the situation in Afghanistan and combating challenges of climate change and the coronavirus pandemic at the two-day G-20 Summit in Italy beginning October 30, people familiar with the development said on Sunday.The Prime Minister will be travelling to Rome and Glasgow from October 29 to November 2 to attend the 16th G-20 Summit and the World Leaders’ Summit of COP-26, respectively, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said.It said Modi will be participating in the 16th G-20 Summit in Rome from October 30-31 at the invitation of Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi. Italy has been holding the presidency of the G-20 since December last year.The G-20 is a leading global forum that brings together the world’s major economies. Its members account for more than 80 per cent of the global GDP, 75 per cent of global trade and 60 per cent of the population of the planet.The forum has met every year since 1999 and includes, since 2008, a yearly summit, with the participation of the respective heads of state and government.The MEA said India is scheduled to host the G-20 summit in 2023 for the first time.The Rome summit will be attended by heads of state and government of G-20 member countries, the European Union, and other invited countries and several international organisations.The G-20 leaders are expected to deliberate on a number of key challenges such as recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, addressing climate change and overcoming poverty and inequality in various parts of the world.The situation in Afghanistan is expected to figure prominently at the summit, said one of the people cited above.Prime Minister Modi is likely to present India’s perspective to combat the key challenges facing the globe and is expected to call for a united approach to the situation in Afghanistan as well to deal with the pandemic and climate change, they said.It will be the eighth G-20 summit Modi would be attending. The G-20 has emerged as the premier global forum for international economic cooperation.The forthcoming summit will be centred around the theme ‘People, Planet, Prosperity’, focusing on areas of recovery from the pandemic and strengthening of global health governance.It will also focus on economic recovery and resilience, climate change and energy transition, and sustainable development and food security, the MEA said in a statement.The Prime Minister will also hold several bilateral meetings, including with Draghi.From Rome, Modi will travel to Glasgow to attend the World Leader’s summit of the 26th Conference of Parties (COP-26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the MEA said.The Prime Minister is attending the climate summit at the invitation of his British counterpart Boris Johnson.The COP-26 is being held from October 31 to November 12 under the presidency of the UK which is partnering with Italy for the event.The MEA said the high-level segment of COP-26, titled the World Leaders’ Summit (WLS), will be held on November 1 to 2. The summit will be attended by heads of state and government of more than 120 countries.“The UNFCCC embodies the global will and vision to combat climate change. The periodic Conference of Parties to this Convention have emerged as global climate summits, providing an opportunity for stocktaking and for charting the way forward,” the MEA said.The Prime Minister last attended the COP-21 in Paris in 2015, when the Paris Agreement was concluded, and whose implementation commences this year.“At COP-26, the parties will work to achieve the completion of Paris Agreement implementation guidelines; the mobilisation of climate finance; actions to strengthen climate adaptation, technology development and transfer; and keeping in reach the Paris Agreement goals of limiting the rise in global temperatures,” it said.The MEA said Modi will hold numerous bilateral meetings on the sidelines of COP-26, including with Johnson.The COP-26 summit is being billed as one of the biggest ever congregations of world leaders and experts in combating climate change.On Thursday, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, highlighting India’s climate action in meeting its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) related to the Paris climate agreement, said that New Delhi intends to go in with a strong message with full commitment to COP26.“We are perhaps the only G-20 country to have fulfilled our NDCs and outperformed them,” Shringla said in a virtual address at the India Global Forum.

24-10-2021||New Delhi||With changing weather patterns, late withdrawal of monsoon is new normal, say experts||The late withdrawal of Southwest Monsoon 2021 appears to be the “new normal”, say experts, attributing the deadly weather fury in the hill state of Uttarakhand to the climate related change in pattern.At the same time, however, the mass destruction is not only because of the climate crisis, they also warn, cautioning that “development plans and human interference are not complimenting the ecological balance” of ecologically fragile states.According to Prof YP Sundriyal (head of Geology Department, HNB Garhwal University) the higher Himalayas are highly sensitive both climatically and tectonically.“So much so that the construction of mega hydro-projects should be avoided or they should be of small capacity. The roads should also be constructed with scientific techniques. However, we see roads are being made or widened without taking proper measures such as no slope stability, lack of good quality retaining wall and rock bolting, measures that can restrict the damage done by landslides up to some extent,” he said.Sundriyal adds that development is important but hydro-power plants, especially in higher Himalayas should be of less capacity.“Policy and project implementation should consist of local geologists who understand the terrain well and how it responds,” he said.The “manifold increase in the tourist influx over the years”, which has led to more “development” is also one of the reasons.Environmentalist Atul Satti says earlier Uttarakhand used to host around 6 lakh tourists per year, a number which has now increased to over 15 lakhs.“With this, there has been an increase in vehicular pollution, river pollution, construction activities, and commercialisation.“The construction of hydropower projects and road widening activities have had a major impact over the region and all have contributed to the increase in temperatures along with change in rainfall pattern,” Satti added.Meanwhile, the IMD said that the Southwest Monsoon is expected to withdraw from the entire country during next 48 hours with the setting in of northeasterly winds over Bay of Bengal and extreme south Peninsular India. Simultaneously, the Northeast Monsoon rains are also likely to commence over Southeast Peninsular India during next 48 hours. Widespread rainfall with isolated heavy falls can again be expected over Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal and south interior Karnataka over the next couple of days.Flash flood fury in Uttarakhand is a classic example of extended stay of monsoon, say experts.Though extreme weather events are not new, their increasing frequency is worrying the experts.GP Sharma of the Skymet Weather says destructive rains in Uttarakhand can be attributed to the extended stay of the Southwest Monsoon 2021.  “It is very much evident that had the monsoon departed timely, we would not have seen such torrential rains. Weather conditions were very favourable for such heavy precipitation on account of multiple weather systems coming together,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-changing-weather-patterns-late-withdrawal-of-monsoon-is-new-normal-say-experts-329001
24-10-2021||New Delhi||HC asks AIIMS to pay over Rs 50 lakh to illegally terminated employee||The Delhi High Court has directed the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to pay over Rs 50 lakh to a former employee, who was illegally terminated from service, noting that the man has been running from pillar to post for the last several years.Raj Singh, who was appointed as a driver by AIIMS sometime in the 1980s, will also be paid Rs 19,900 as pension every month.According to the petitioner, he was illegally terminated after which he approached the labour court. The labour court in December 1998 held that the termination of service was an unfair labour practice, Singh said in his petition.The labour court’s order was challenged before various forums and finally the Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed by AIIMS was dismissed by the Supreme Court on June 3, 2016.Petitioner Singh, represented through advocate B T Kaul, served a legal notice to authorities seeking compliance of the award and payment of the amount, but it was not paid.Thereafter, he approached the high court.Justice Prathiba M Singh directed that the man be paid Rs 50,49,079 towards salary for the period from December 4, 1998, which is the date of award, and the date of superannuation, which is October 31, 2016, his leave encashment and his gratuity.It was directed that Rs 19,900 be paid to him as monthly pension.This amount was calculated by the authorities and the court was informed about it. However, the basis for the computation has still not been explained.“However, considering that the petitioner (Singh) has been running from pillar to post since 2016 when the Supreme Court dismissed the SLP till date, the respondents (authorities) are directed to pay the amounts in terms of order dated March 9, 2021, on or before October 30, 2021, to the petitioner workman,” the high court said in its October 12 order.The court was also told by advocate Sonali Malhotra, representing AIIMS officials, that the workman was also required to deposit Rs 30,000 as a lifetime validation amount for being enrolled under the Employees Health Scheme.To this, the court said that in view of the long duration for which Singh has been fighting the present litigation, the amount of Rs 30,000 shall now be deposited on his behalf by AIIMS itself, in lieu of costs for the long-drawn litigation.It said all the amounts due and payable shall be released by October 30 and a compliance affidavit giving the details of the computation and the manner in which it has been done, as also confirming the payment, shall be filed on or before November 15.The court asked the petitioner’s counsel to give details of the workman’s bank accounts to the counsel for AIIMS for remitting the payment.

24-10-2021||New Delhi||SC slams Uttarakhand government for filing ‘frivolous’ appeal, warns of penal action||The Supreme Court has slammed the Uttarakhand government for filing a “frivolous” appeal challenging the reduction of sentence of a man in a case of attempt to murder.A bench of Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Vikram Nath noted that the counsel for the accused did not challenge the conviction before the Uttarakhand High Court and only argued for reduction of sentence and the lawyer for the State did not oppose such a prayer for reduction of sentence.The top court dismissed the petition filed by the Uttarakhand government with a warning to the State that any other attempt of frivolous litigation in this court may be visited with penalisation of the officers responsible for sanctioning.“It is rather disturbing to note that in such a matter, where the State’s counsel before the high court did not even oppose the prayer for reduction of sentence and the high court made a slight modification in the sentence considering the facts and circumstances of the case in totality, the State has chosen to approach this court seeking special leave to appeal without any justification."“The present petition could only be said to be a frivolous litigation by the State,” the bench said in its October 20 order.The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by Uttarakhand challenging judgement and order dated August 20, 2020, passed by the high court in which it maintained the conviction of the accused of offences under Sections 307 (attempt to murder)/34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 25 of the Arms Act.The high court, however, reduced the sentence in relation to the offence under Sections 307/34 IPC to rigorous imprisonment of four years and five months instead of seven years and also reduced the fine amount to Rs. 15,000 instead of Rs 20,000. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-slams-uttarakhand-government-for-filing-frivolous-appeal-warns-of-penal-action-328993

24-10-2021||New York||Internal Facebook documents show struggle with misinformation, hate speech and celebrations of violence in India: Report||Internal documents at Facebook show “a struggle with misinformation, hate speech and celebrations of violence” in India, the company’s biggest market, with researchers at the social media giant pointing out that there are groups and pages “replete with inflammatory and misleading anti-Muslim content” on its platform, US media reports have said.In a report published on Saturday, The New York Times said in February 2019, a Facebook researcher created a new user account to look into what the social media website will look like for a person living in Kerala.“For the next three weeks, the account operated by a simple rule: Follow all the recommendations generated by Facebook’s algorithms to join groups, watch videos and explore new pages on the site. The result was an inundation of hate speech, misinformation and celebrations of violence, which were documented in an internal Facebook report published later that month,” the NYT report said.“Internal documents show a struggle with misinformation, hate speech and celebrations of violence in the country, the company’s biggest market,” said the report based on disclosures obtained by a consortium of news organisations, including the New York Times and the Associated Press.The documents are part of a larger cache of material collected by whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee who recently testified before the Senate about the company and its social media platforms.The report said the internal documents include reports on how bots and fake accounts tied to the “country’s ruling party and opposition figures” were wreaking havoc on national elections.The NYT said in a separate report produced after the 2019 national elections, Facebook found that “over 40 per cent of top views, or impressions, in the Indian state of West Bengal were fake/inauthentic”. One inauthentic account had amassed more than 30 million impressions.In an internal document titled ‘Adversarial Harmful Networks: India Case Study’, Facebook researchers wrote that there were groups and pages “replete with inflammatory and misleading anti-Muslim content” on Facebook.The internal documents also detail how a plan “championed” by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to focus on “meaningful social interactions” was leading to more misinformation in India, particularly during the pandemic.The NYT report added that another Facebook report detailed efforts by Bajrang Dal to publish posts containing anti-Muslim narratives on the platform.“Facebook is considering designating the group as a dangerous organisation because it is “inciting religious violence” on the platform, the document showed. But it has not yet done so,” the NYT report said.The documents show that Facebook did not have enough resources in India and was not able to grapple with the problems it had introduced there, including anti-Muslim posts.A Facebook spokesman, Andy Stone, said Facebook has reduced the amount of hate speech that people see globally by half this year.“Hate speech against marginalised groups, including Muslims, is on the rise in India and globally,” Stone said in the NYT report. “So we are improving enforcement and are committed to updating our policies as hate speech evolves online.” In India, “there is definitely a question about resourcing” for Facebook, but the answer is not “just throwing more money at the problem,” said Katie Harbath, who spent 10 years at Facebook as a director of public policy, and worked directly on securing India’s national elections.The NYT report said Facebook employees “have run various tests and conducted field studies in India for several years. That work increased ahead of India’s 2019 national elections”.In late January 2019, a few Facebook employees travelled to India to meet with colleagues and speak to dozens of local Facebook users, it said.“According to a memo written after the trip, one of the key requests from users in India was that Facebook ‘take action on types of misinfo that are connected to real-world harm, specifically politics and religious group tension’,” the report said.The report added that after India’s national elections had begun, “Facebook put in place a series of steps to stem the flow of misinformation and hate speech in the country, according to an internal document called ‘Indian Election Case Study’.“The case study painted an optimistic picture of Facebook’s efforts, including adding more fact-checking partners — the third-party network of outlets with which Facebook works to outsource fact-checking — and increasing the amount of misinformation it removed.“The study did not note the immense problem the company faced with bots in India, nor issues like voter suppression. During the election, Facebook saw a spike in bots — or fake accounts — linked to various political groups, as well as efforts to spread misinformation that could have affected people’s understanding of the voting process.”Citing the Facebook report, the NYT said of India’s 22 officially recognised languages, Facebook has trained its AI systems on five. But in Hindi and Bengali, it still did not have enough data to adequately police the content, and much of the content targeting Muslims “is never flagged or actioned.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/internal-facebook-documents-show-struggle-with-misinformation-hate-speech-and-celebrations-of-violence-in-india-report-328981

24-10-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi applauds India's health workers for making a success of Covid vaccine programme||Prime Minister Narendra Modi applauded India’s vaccination programme on Sunday—days after the country crossed a billion cumulative doses of Covid-19 vaccines.Modi, who was addressing the 83rd edition of his monthly broadcast ‘Mann ki Baat’, said health workers across the country worked hard and fought many an odd to keep the programme going.“I used to be often asked the reason for my confidence about the vaccination drive. The reason was my confidence in people of the country,” Modi said.Modi also pitched for drone technology in his address, saying the use of drones will dominate the socio-economic landscape in the coming times. Modi opened his address with reference to the vaccination drive, noting that crossing the billion-plus vaccination milestone inheres within a legion of untold and challenging experiences and emotions, including of medical fraternity, especially health workers.With regard to the use of drones, he urged the youth to innovate in its technology to make India among the front-rankers in this field.India is among the first countries to use drone service for mapping of village land, he said. Drones are being used for community services, he said as he referred to their use in the delivery of utilities and transportation of vaccines in challenging geographical terrains in places such as Manipur and Gujarat.The Union government recently has eased the rules for the use and manufacture of drones.

24-10-2021||Kohima||New interlocutor ‘failed to live up to hype’, unable to resolve demand for flag, constitution: NSCN(IM)||The NSCN(IM) has said talks with the new central interlocutor had “failed to live up to the hype” created and been unable to resolve Naga demands for a separate flag and a Yehzabo (constitution or a chapter in the constitution).The Naga rebel group’s strongly worded statement comes within a month of a new interlocutor, A K Mishra, a former IPS officer who has specialised in northeast affairs in the Intelligence Bureau, being appointed replacing then Nagaland Governor R N Ravi as the government’s negotiator.The NSCN(IM), the main rebel group holding out on a peace deal, accused the government of indulging “in political escapism on the very issues that are holding up the road to the Naga solution”.The Indian government has till now been unwilling to accept the Naga demands for a separate constitution or a chapter on Nagaland in the Indian constitution or a separate flag. This is seen by observers as stemming from the fact that it had abrogated Article 370 which gave a separate status to Jammu and Kashmir and it was unwilling to concede similar demands from other states or groups.As a via media, negotiators had indicated that the demand for a flag for Nagaland could be accommodated as a cultural symbol.The NSCN (IM), however, made it clear that “the Naga issue is not a cultural issue” and treating the flag as a “cultural symbol” and not as “political identity as symbolised by the Naga flag” was not acceptable to it.“Where is the need for the ceasefire if the Naga issue is a cultural problem and where is the need to drag on the talks for more than two decades if the issue is to solve cultural conflicts?” the statement questioned.The rebel group pointed out that the Naga political talks had “ultimately led to the signing of the historic Framework Agreement on the 3rd August, 2015” and claimed that gave “due recognition to the sovereign identity of the Naga nation.” It went on to state that the Government of India is “still pretentiously acting stubborn as the crucial rounds of talks that focused on the Naga flag and the constitution is driven to hang in balance.”It termed the “stalemate created” as “unfortunate”.Officials said a final pact which would comprehensively deal with all issues was being worked out. The aim was to finalise it by the next year when the nation would be celebrating its 75th independence day.However, the NSCN(IM) statement issued on Saturday seems to indicate that the pact is far from ready.Earlier, the last interlocutor Ravi and the NSCN(IM) had crossed swords over a ruling that the Naga rebel group could not collect “tax” from businessmen in Nagaland, which the Centre considered to be a form of extortionist appropriation which undermined the sovereign right of the state.

The MEA was among the several foreign offices that had been trying for a call-on by their leader on the Pope on the sidelines of the G-20 summit.PM Modi will then attend the 26th meeting of an UN-sponsored meeting on climate change in Glasgow. There are indications that he may stay on in Glasgow for another day to co-chair an event with UK PM Boris Johnson.PM Modi has been leading India’s representation at all successive G-20 summits since 2014. India is a founder-member of the G20 which has not changed in size since its inception in 1999.At the G-20 meeting, there are expectations that the threads will be picked up on Afghanistan after the 10-country meeting with a Taliban delegation in Moscow and the earlier talks at the UN where generous humanitarian donations were announced. The Taliban has yet shown no inclination of meeting the prerequisites for recognising their dispensation in Kabul – an inclusive government accommodating Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazara leaders.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-all-set-to-join-g-20-troika-in-rome-next-week-328775

PTIThe study shows India has been pushed back to early 2010 when it comes to gains made on the front of life expectancy. Researchers concluded that the pandemic had negative effect on both the life expectancy (e0) at birth and inequality in age at death (G0). They said the men had been more vulnerable.“Covid-19 has demonstrated its potential to cancel the gains of six to eight years in life expectancy at birth and has slowed the mortality transition in India.
