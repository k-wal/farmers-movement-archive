16-10-2021||New Delhi||BJP questions Congress silence on Singhu border killing, mocks the Congress Working Committee meeting||The BJP on Saturday mocked the Congress Working Committee meeting as “parivar bachao working committee”, claiming that it offered no answers to the party’s “internal rift and leadership failures” and instead resorted to “spreading lies”.BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia also criticised the CWC for not reacting to the gruesome murder of a Dalit man at the Singhu border and questioned if the opposition party stood with the “Talibani mindset” behind the killing.Anarchic elements are using farmers for their politics, he also claimed.Bhatia claimed the Opposition, especially the Congress, will maintain a “deafening silence” because “it does not suit their political narrative”.He also attacked farmer leader Rakesh Tikait for his reported remarks that organisers cannot be blamed for such an incident.BJP’s IT cell in charge Amit Malviya said that 24 hours after the gruesome murder of “Lakhbir Singh, a Dalit Sikh, Rahul Gandhi hasn’t said a word. Neither has Punjab CM announced any compensation for the family, which hails from Punjab. Clearly, for the Congress, Dalit lives are expendable, as long as it suits their politics”.Bhatia, meanwhile, also took a swipe at Sonia Gandhi over her assertion that she was a “full time and hands on” Congress chief, noting her status as the interim president of the organisation and the demands of the “G-23” for a full time chief.“It will not be wrong to say that it was less a Congress Working Committee and more a parivar bachao working committee (save family working committee),” he said, alleging that Gandhi’s opening remarks did not touch on a host of issues facing the party and left unanswered people’s questions about Congress-run governments in different states.The BJP spokesperson said the Congress again advanced the politics of lies and spreading confusion, in an apparent reference to her attack on the Narendra Modi government over a host of issues, including three “black (farm) laws”, killings in Jammu and Kashmir, Lakhimpur Kheri violence and the state of the economy.He cited the police lathi-charge on a group of protesting farmers in Congress-ruled states of Punjab and Rajasthan and a law on contract farming brought in by Punjab that says “farmers can be arrested for breaking the agreement”.“This is what a black law is, and the Congress president should ensure that it is withdrawn,” he said.He also took a dig at Gandhi for the part of her statement in which she says all CWC are now doubly vaccinated, paving the way for its first physical meeting since the Covid-19 outbreak, reminding the Congress criticism of the government’s vaccination policies.“The Congress should offer words of thanks to scientists and doctors when 100 crore doses of vaccines are completed in a few days,” he added. He also criticised Gandhi for not visiting her Lok Sabha constituency of Rai Bareli for over 21 months, calling her a failure as an MP.Tikait calls the killing ‘unfortunate’, says ‘will not affect farmers’ protest against the Centre’s three farm laws’BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, who called the alleged killing “unfortunate”, has also termed it a conspiracy against the farmers’ agitation.Tikait said that it will not affect farmers’ protest against the Centre’s three farm laws.“Whatever happened is wrong and unfortunate. Someone killed him and later the police arrested the killer. The matter is subject to investigation. It will not affect our protest,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-questions-congress-silence-on-singhu-border-killing-%C2%A0mocks-the-congress-working-committee-meeting-325466

16-10-2021||Mumbai||Releasing HIV+ woman involved in sex trade poses danger to society: Court||A sessions court in Mumbai upheld a magistrate’s order to detain a HIV positive woman, allegedly involved in prostitution, and noted that setting her at large is likely to pose a danger to society.The woman, as per her lawyer, is an actor and her father is a policeman.The sessions court upheld the magistrate’s order earlier this month, but the details were made available on Friday.Earlier, the Mazgaon metropolitan magistrate court had directed the detention of the woman, also referred to as victim who as per police was caught red-handed while trying to indulge in prostitution, for two years under section 17(4) of Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act (PITA).As per the 17(A) of PITA, a magistrate can order a person in need of care and protection to be sent to a protective home or custody.The woman had filed an appeal in the sessions court in Dindoshi claiming there was an error in the magisterial order, with her lawyer arguing her father could maintain her and that everyone in the victim’s family was financially sound.The lawyer further said she was held due to a misunderstanding and because she was HIV positive, with the prosecution refuting the claim stating she was caught red-handed.The prosecution further said she was sent for vocational training etc as she was HIV positive and that the magistrate court’s order was proper.Additional Sessions Judge SU Baghele said even though the appellant had submitted she was not involved in prostitution, the perusal of the FIR, prima facie, reveals otherwise due to which she was considered a victim.“As the victim is indisputably suffering from HIV, which can be easily transmitted through sexual intercourse, the setting of the victim at large is likely to pose danger to the society,” he said.The court stated care and protection of the victim can be ensured by detaining her, as directed by the magistrate, so that the victim leads a normal life in future.The court held the magistrate’s order as “correct and legal” and said it didn’t require any interference. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/releasing-hiv-woman-involved-in-sex-trade-poses-danger-to-society-court-325460

16-10-2021||New Delhi||India to reach 100-crore Covid vaccination mark next week: Health minister||India will cross the landmark of 100-crore Covid-19 vaccine doses next week, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Saturday as a Covid-anthem penned by singer Kailash Kher was released to dispel myths and shed vaccine hesitancy.Till this evening, as many as “97.23 crore have been administered the first dose of Covid vaccine in the country”, he said at the launch event.The vaccines administered suggest about 70 per cent of the population getting at least one dose and about 30 per cent of the population has got two doses, he said.“We administered 2.5 crore doses one single day on September 17 and next week we will reach the 100 crore mark,” he said.“This has happened because of the effort put in by all.” Covid-19 infections are decreasing in India, with 15,981 new infections reported in a day, according to official data on Saturday. That’s 4 per cent of the peak — the highest daily average reported on May 9 this year.The minister said while it takes 5-10 years to test and develop vaccines, India has researched and developed an in-house vaccine, and to add to the complex manufacturing, the humongous logistics involving setting up cold chains, airport transfers, delivery to states, local storage and last-mile connectivity were set up in no time.Kher, who has composed and sung the anthem, said it is essential to dispel myths and rumours surrounding vaccines and promote its usage so as to ensure all get the vaccine.The development of a song called ‘tika-anthem’ or vaccine anthem has been sponsored by oil industry body FIPI.Speaking on the occasion, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said vaccination has now become a people’s movement despite the negative narrative and falsehood spread by some in the country.“It is not the government which is the enemy, it is the virus which is the enemy,” he said referring to the narrative opposition parties tried to build around the vaccination drive in the country.Stating that vaccine manufacturing in the public sector was stopped during the Congress-led UPA regime between 2004 and 2014, he said the opposition tried to create a “negative narrative” over the issue of domestically manufactured vaccines being safe.“Vaccine hesitancy was spread but with the determination, focus and commitment of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we were able to overcome and vaccination became a ‘jan andolan’ (people’s movement),” he said.Puri said when the second wave of Covid infections broke out in April/May, modelling of rate of infections threw a maximum number of infections of 2.5-3 lakh but the peak touched 4.24 lakh cases.“It’s a combined effort due to which we have reached where we are,” he said. “Artists capture people’s imagination directly and so when we are within striking distance of the 1 billion vaccination mark, the vaccine anthem will look to promote greater use and reach the target of vaccine for all.”       He, however, cautioned that it was too early to declare victory over the virus.“We will be better equipped to deal with (a new challenge) both in terms of infrastructure and medical science” but “we should not declare victory yet”. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-reach-100-crore-covid-vaccination-mark-next-week-health-minister-325446
16-10-2021||New Delhi||CCTV cameras, security review by farmer unions in the aftermath of Singhu border lynching||Facing flak over the gruesome killing of a man at the Singhu border, farmer leaders on Saturday said they will upgrade security by installing CCTV cameras and increasing the number of volunteers at the protest sites even as they asserted that the incident will have no impact on the agitation against the Centre’s three agri laws.Lakhbir Singh, a 36-year-old Dalit farm labourer, was lynched on Friday allegedly by a group of Nihangs who accused him of desecrating a Sikh holy book. His body was found tied to an overturned police barricade at the Singhu Border protest site, with the left hand chopped off and over 10 wounds caused by sharp-edged weapons.One Sarabjit Singh has been arrested and remanded in police custody for a week.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmer unions is spearheading the protests, issued a statement on Friday distancing itself from the incident and said that it wanted to make it clear that “both the parties to the incident”, the Nihang group and the victim, have no relation with the Morcha.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), which is leading the charge at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border, said more cameras would be installed and there shall be a change in the deployment of volunteers at the protest site in the wake of the Friday incident.“So far volunteers affiliated to local groups of farmer unions were deployed at the protest site to monitor the situation and coordinate security-related issues. But it has been decided now that such volunteers shall be deployed only by SKM at protest sites,” BKU’s media in-charge Dharmendra Malik told PTI.It was also decided that the groups or individuals who are participating in the movement but hold ideologies that are different from the SKM’s policies shall be asked to vacate the protest sites or adopt the agendas of the farmers’ collective, he added.Farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar of Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh, which is part of SKM, said that the farmers’ body stays proactive whenever such an incident occurs and revises its security details, if needed.“Be it the West Bengal girl’s incident or any other small issues, SKM remains at the front to offer help to the administration and the victims. And we keep reviewing our security arrangement and improve it when needed,” Kohar said.Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary of BKU (Lakhowal), alleged that the incident was a ploy to divert attention from the Lakhimpur Kheri incident.“Tell me one place where such incidents don’t occur? In villages, cities, towns everywhere. But they create so much noise about this because they want to divert attention from Lakhimpur Kheri. No leader is talking about it, everyone is waiting for it to pass,” Lakhowal said.Farmer leader Kavitha Kuruganti of the Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch also blamed the government “for pointing at one or two such incidents” and terming the protesters violent in the hope of weakening the movement.“They pick up one or two incidents and say you are growing violent. We are not growing violent. We have been consistently peaceful.“It’s the government’s tactics hoping that incidents like this will weaken the movement that ultimately it will disperse but is id not going to happen. We will only grow stronger. Our core value is of non-violence,” Kuruganti said.Meanwhile, the Congress also said on Friday that it was the government’s responsibility to investigate the lynching, while the BJP asserted that in the name of farmers, the “anarchists” behind these protests need to be exposed.Hundreds of farmers from different parts of the country have been camping at the Delhi borders since November 26 last year, demanding the repeal of the three new farm laws.While the agitating unions have been expressing fear that the laws would do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving farmers at the mercy of the corporations, the government has been projecting them as major agricultural reforms.Over 10 rounds of talks between the two sides have failed to break the deadlock.The Supreme Court had stayed the implementation of the laws in January.

16-10-2021||Lucknow||Extremely sad, shameful: Mayawati on Singhu border lynching||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Saturday said the lynching of a Dalit man at a farmers’ protest site near the Delhi-Haryana border was extremely sad and shameful.The body of a Dalit farm labourer from Punjab, Lakhbir Singh, 35, was on Friday found tied to an overturned police barricade at the Singhu border where farmers are protesting against the Centre’s agri laws. His left hand was chopped off and his body had over 10 wounds caused by sharp-edged weapons.Hours after the macabre crime, a man wearing the blue robe of Sikhs’ Nihang order appeared before the media, claiming that he had “punished” the victim for “desecrating” a Sikh holy book.“The brutal murder of a Dalit youth from Punjab at Delhi’s Singhu border is extremely sad and shameful. The police must take the incident seriously and take strong action against the accused persons.“The BSP demands that the Dalit chief minister of Punjab should give a financial assistance of Rs 50 lakh and a government job to the aggrieved family, as was done in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident,” Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmer unions that is spearheading the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s three agri laws, said a group of Nihangs has claimed responsibility for the brutal killing after the man allegedly tried to desecrate the ‘Sarbloh Granth’.A man, Sarabjit Singh, has been arrested in connection with the lynching. Earlier on Saturday, a Haryana court sent him to seven-day police custody.According to police, Sarabjit named four more people during interrogations while pointing to their involvement in the incident. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/extremely-sad-shameful-mayawati-on-singhu-border-lynching-325443

16-10-2021||Kohima||Naga issue: NSCN-IM firm on separate flag, constitution; NNPG holds talk with GoI pointsman||Hardening its stand on peace talks with the government, the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN-IM) has said its position on the demand for a separate Naga national flag and constitution is unchanged as these are emblematic of the Naga political struggle and identity.The NSCN-IM, which resumed talks to find a solution to the decades-old Naga political issue after a gap of almost two years, said in a statement on Friday that the problem is “deeply rooted in India’s malicious pleasure, violating the historical and political rights of the Naga people”.Meanwhile, A K Mishra, the Government of India’s representative for Naga talks, held a meeting with the Working Committee members of Naga National Political Groups (NNPG), an umbrella organisation of seven outfits opposed to NSCN-IM, in New Delhi on Friday, a release issued by the media cell of NNPG said.“The consultation was a cordial affair with both sides displaying consistency and commitment of purpose, taking up the thread from where former Interlocutor R N Ravi left,” it said, adding further deliberations will continue in the near future to work out the finer details of an enduring relationship.However, talking tough, the NSCN-IM said the issue of a Naga national flag and Yehzabo (Constitution) were stalling a solution to the lingering problem, and accused the Centre of indulging in divisive policy. “Ironically, when the issue gets too hot to handle, the Government of India started to indulge in divisive policy and flattery in the name of finding the Naga political solution,” it said, apparently referring to the talks between the NNPG and the government interlocutor.“The chequered history of the Indo-Naga political issue is clear enough before us, with accords and agreements that were never meant to be implemented in letter and spirit,” it said and added “the Naga flag with divine origin cannot be traded or bargained to make the Nagas infidel people.”The NSCN-IM had signed a Framework Agreement with GoI on August 3, 2015, but final agreement has not been reached yet.The Working Committee of NPPG entered into a parallel dialogue with the Centre in 2017 and inked the Agreed Position the same year.Talks were said to have concluded with both the groups in October 2019 during the tenure of then interlocutor R N Ravi but a final solution is still elusive.The NSCN-IM, the largest of the extremist groups active in Nagaland, joined the peace talks with the government in 1997.Hopes of a solution to the vexed Naga question brightened when Ravi, then the Centre’s interlocutor, was appointed the governor of Nagaland in 2019. However, things got bitter soon afterwards as Ravi accused NSCN-IM of delaying a comprehensive agreement and wrote a letter to Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, calling the outfit “armed gangs” who were running a parallel government.NSCN-IM responded by seeking removal of Ravi as the governor and interlocutor. Ravi was removed in September 2021 and Mishra was appointed the Centre’s interlocutor for carrying forward the peace talks.

16-10-2021||Bhopal||MP: Pragya Thakur terms man who shot her kabaddi video as 'Ravana'||After a viral video showed her playing kabaddi, Bhopal's BJP MP Pragya Singh Thakur, who was confined to a wheelchair for a long time and had obtained bail in the 2008 Malegaon blast case on medical grounds, described the one who shot and circulated the clip as "Ravana" and said his old age and next birth will get spoiled.Thakur was speaking during a Dussehra programme in Bhopal's Sant Nagar (Bairagarh), a Sindhi community-dominated area, on Friday night.“I went for offering aarti (at a Durga pandal) two days back, when some sportsmen playing on a ground requested me to conduct a (kabaddi) raid. A small clip of this was captured and shown in the media," she said. "If someone fretted and fumed, it was Ravana among you, some Sindhi brother...someone who is a big enemy (of mine). I am not his enemy, but he considered me as his enemy. I don't know what precious thing I snatched from him...But Ravana can be anywhere," she added. "I am telling the person, whose sanskaras have got spoiled, to mend them. If you don't, your old age and next birth will also get spoiled because whenever anyone has clashed with the patriots, revolutionaries and above all saints, neither Ravana or Kansa survived, nor will the 'adharmi' or 'vidharmi' of the present be saved," she said. She said that her 'tapasya' (penance) and meditation was for public. The video that went viral on social media showed Thakur playing a game of kabaddi on the premises of a Kali temple.Earlier, another video of her taking part in a Garba dance during the just-concluded Navratri festival had emerged.Defending the Bhopal MP, her elder sister Upma Thakur had earlier said that she suffers from a spine problem, which can give trouble to her any time.“You never know at which moment it can create problems for her. There is a problem with her L4 and L5 bones (vertebrae) as they got dislocated because ATS Maharashtra (investigators) threw her on the floor. "Whenever these problems occur, the lower portion (of her body) is left with no sensation....It can happen even when she sits or gets down from a vehicle," Upma had said. On the other, MP Congress leaders, while taking a swipe at Pragya Thakur accused her of having many faces as sometimes she is seen in a wheelchair, sometime she plays Garba and kabaddi too.

16-10-2021||Aditi Tandon||I am a full-time, hands-on Congress chief, Sonia Gandhi says at Congress Working Committee meeting||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 16Sonia Gandhi on Saturday firmly told the Congress Working Committee that she is a “full-time and hands-on Congress president”, days after G-23 leader Kapil Sibal had said that no one knew who was taking decisions in the party since there was no elected president.Putting the Congress organisational election schedule on the table, Gandhi took on dissenters within and said they don’t need to speak to her through the media.“I have always appreciated frankness. There is no need to speak to me through the media. So let us all have a free and honest discussion. But what should get communicated outside the four walls of this room is the collective decision of the CWC,” she said at a time when several veterans, including Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma, have been voicing anxieties over the sliding Congress strength and exodus of leaders besides demanding internal elections.Sonia in her opening remarks said, “I am, if you will allow me to say so, a full-time and hands-on Congress president. Never have we let issues of public importance and concern go unaddressed. You are aware that I have been taking them up with the Prime Minister as have Dr Manmohan Singh and Rahul ji. I have been interacting with like-minded political parties regularly. We have issued joint statements on national issues and coordinated our strategy in Parliament as well.”Apart from addressing internal issues, Sonia also attacked the government for mishandling the farmers’ agitation and for the spate of killings in Jammu and Kashmir.On the government’s reaction to a flailing economy, Sonia said the Centre’s single-point agenda is, “Becho becho becho.”On the farmers’ issue, Sonia said the shocking incidents at Lakhimpur Kheri recently betrayed the mindset of the BJP, how it perceived the Kisan Andolan, how it had been dealing with this determined struggle by farmers to protect their lives and livelihoods.She was silent on the Singhu killing of Friday.The Congress chief, however, commented on the killings in J&K saying, “In recent days, there has been a sudden spurt in killings in Jammu and Kashmir.  Minorities clearly have been targeted. This must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. We have done so and I do so again this morning. J&K has been a Union Territory for two years. The entire responsibility for bringing the perpetrators of these barbaric crimes to justice is that of the Union Government. Restoring social peace and harmony and confidence among the people of J&K rests with the Modi government.”She also accused the government of disturbing the broad domestic political consensus on foreign policy saying, “Foreign policy has become a diabolical instrument of electoral mobilisation and polarisation. We face serious challenges on our borders and on other fronts. The Prime Minister telling the opposition leaders last year that there had not been any occupation of our territory by China and his silence ever since is costing our nation dearly.”The CWC would also be hearing of the party’s preparations for the forthcoming assembly elections with Sonia stressing the need for unity and discipline to win.“Undoubtedly, we face many challenges but if we are united, if we are disciplined and if we focus on the oarty’s interests alone, I am confident that we will do well,” she said.According to the organisational election schedule shared at the CWC, the Congress president’s election is proposed to be concluded by September 2022.The CWC meeting concluded after five and a half hours.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-am-a-full-time-hands-on-congress-chief-sonia-gandhi-says-at-congress-working-committee-meeting-325405

Being a government department, the OFB was handicapped in reaching out to newer technologies or functioning with flexibility at the speed at which technology is changing.The MoD has set a target of achieving a turnover of Rs 1,75,000 crore in aerospace and defence goods and services by 2024. This includes exports worth Rs 35,000 crore.

But when she insisted that the photographer leave the room, “she was completely ignored”.“She was very upset. My parents are trying to cope in a difficult situation. They are elderly people. Not animals in a zoo,” Daman Singh said.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said for the BJP people everything is a “photo op”.“Everything is a ‘Photo Op’ for BJP. Shame on health minister, who made a visit to meet former PM in AIIMS, a ugly ‘PR Stunt’,” he said in a tweet.“This is..Negation of every ethical norm, Breach of ex-PM’s privacy, insult of established tradition, reflects absence of basic decency. Apologise now!” Surjewala tweeted.Rajya Sabha MP and senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said, “Photo op is the hallmark of the Modi government”.Congress leader Manickam Tagore said the minister’s actions were a “serious breach of privacy” and asked why Mandviya walked in with cameras.“When former PM Vajpayee was in hospital whether we got pictures from AIIMS? It’s crime @crpfindia must answer? AIIMS must answer?” Tagore tweeted.Tagore said he will write to President Ram Nath Kovind to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers to stop these “petty things”.Another senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi said, “I know you all are concerned about the health of former PM Manmohan Singh but kindly do stop sharing photos of him from his hospital bed. It’s invasion of his and his family’s privacy and not good conduct in any way.”           Congress leader Salman Anees Soz said that when the Union Health Minister visited Manmohan Singh at AIIMS, his photographer went inside over the objections of the family.“How distasteful is this propaganda regime?” he said.Daman Singh said her parents had expressly insisted that visitors be restricted because her father is suffering from dengue and his immunity is low, and there is the risk of infection.The former prime minister had contracted COVID-19 in April, at the height of the second wave in Delhi, despite two doses of the vaccine.“It was nice of the health minister to visit and express his concern,” Daman Singh said, adding, “However, my parents were in no state to be photographed at the time.”       Manmohan  Singh was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here on Wednesday evening after he complained of weakness following fever.The 89-year-old former prime minister has been admitted to a private ward in the cardio-neuro centre of the hospital and is under the care of a team of cardiologists led by Dr Nitish Naik.
