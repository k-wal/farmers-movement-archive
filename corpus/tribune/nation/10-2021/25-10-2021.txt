Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine has received full US FDA approval for use in individuals 16 years of age and older.The cumulative COVID-19 vaccines administered in the country has exceeded 102.27 crore. Of all the vaccine doses administered, around 90 per cent are Covishield and close to 10 per cent are Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. Less than one per cent of the doses given are Sputnik V.The Pune-based SII has submitted the final phase 2/3 clinical study report of India with its application for grant of regular market authorisation for Covishield, an official source said.According to the application by Singh, the firm has already submitted phase-3 clinical study results of 24,244 subjects from the UK, Brazil and South Africa on June 8, 2021, to the  Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO).Also, phase-3 clinical study results of 32,379 subjects from the US, Chile and Peru were submitted on July 9.“In addition to the successful completion of our phase 2/3 clinical study in India, till now more than 100 crore doses of our Covishield has been administered to people in our country and worldwide.“Such a large-scale vaccination with our Covishield vaccine and containment of COVID-19 infection is in itself a testimony to the safety and efficacy of Covishield,” the official source quoted Singh as having stated in the application.Singh thanked the DCGI office and Subject Expert Committee for granting restricted emergency use approval to Covishield on January 3, because of which, he said, the vaccine played a crucial role in the pandemic control and has been the mainstay of India’s Covid inoculation drive.“It is a matter of pride for us that we have been a part of the world’s largest vaccination drive under the dynamic and visionary leadership of our Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji,” Singh is learnt to have said in the application.Under the kind guidance of Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, Team Government of India and leadership of CEO Adar C Poonawalla, Team Serum Institute of India has been working relentlessly to manufacture and supply Covishield vaccine for making the world’s largest Covid vaccination drive successful, he said.“In line with our prime minister’s clarion call of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, we have made our country Aatmanirbhar for COVID-19 vaccine. In view of the above-mentioned facts, we request for your kind approval for regular market authorization of Covishield,” Singh is learnt to have written in the application.

MD Mahima Datla on Monday unveiled the expansion of the vaccine maker’s manufacturing facility in Hyderabad.They finalised a US government financing arrangement formalising $ 50 million to expand the company’s capacity, said a DFC news release here.This work is in support of the commitment set out by President Biden and his counterparts in the “Quad” – Australia, India, Japan, and the US – added the release.The aim is to support Biological E to produce over 100 crore vaccine doses by the end of 2022 for India and for developing countries.Marchick is leading a team of Biden officials for this initiative. “We’re trying to help create hubs for vaccine manufacturing and hubs for this type of expertise. Much like Silicon Valley is a hub for technology,’’ he has said.The DFC helps secure US financing for infrastructure projects in the developing world. It was created, in part, to compete with China’s infrastructure loan program, the Belt and Road Initiative.The DFC has committed nearly $600 million to Covid vaccine-related investments.“What we’ve learned through the pandemic is that we need stronger and diversified supply chains. So we’ve been focused on driving manufacturing in different regions in large countries like India and smaller countries like South Africa,’’ Marchick has said.Biden has stepped up to meet the developing world’s vaccine needs through the Quad but he’s also faced criticism from the WHO and others for offering booster shots to fully vaccinated Americans when millions of people around the world were yet to receive a first dose.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-be-silicon-valley-for-vaccines-us-329482
25-10-2021||---||Don’t cast doubt on Covid-19 vaccination, says SC; rejects PIL against it||New Delhi, October 25Maintaining that vaccination was key to protecting people from Covid-19, the Supreme Court Monday dismissed a petition seeking directions to stop mass vaccination of Covishield and Covaxin till all stages of clinical trials were completed.“Let’s not cast doubt on the vaccination process. It’s a key to protecting the population. We don’t want the petition to be argued at all. Even issuing notice on this appeal will be subject to great mischief,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud told the petitioner’s counsel.In its May 26 order, the High Court had dismissed the PIL filed by Mathew Thomas—an ex-serviceman—and two others and imposed a cost of Rs 50,000 on them for filing a frivolous PIL.The petitioners had contended before the High Court that it’s not clear under which law has the union government allowed mass vaccination of the population without completion of clinical trials.On Monday, the petitioner’s counsel submitted that allowing mass vaccination without completion of the clinical trial violated the relevant rules and, therefore, administering Covishield and Covaxin vaccines was harmful and illegal. But the Bench wasn’t convinced at all.However, the top court refused to entertain the challenge to the May 26 order of Karnataka High Court dismissing Mathew’s petition, saying “The High Court is right in dismissing the plea. It said the country had gone through a very critical stage during the pandemic and India was not the only country where vaccination was underway, it added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-cast-doubt-on-covid-19-vaccination-says-sc-rejects-pil-against-it-329476
25-10-2021||Dinhata (WB)||Mamata only vaccine against "Virus BJP": Abhishek Banerjee||TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee Monday courted controversy by calling BJP a "virus"  and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee the "only vaccine" which will "eradicate" it  in the next Lok Sabha poll in the country.Banerjee also slammed the saffron camp calling it the "enemy of the Hindus" for trying to allegedly polarise the upcoming assembly by-poll in West Bengal by using as a poll plank the violence against the Hindu minority in neighbouring Bangladesh.The de facto number two in the Trinamool Congress also criticised BJP for "thrusting" on the people the by-election in two of the four seats that will go to the poll later this week."Winning BJP candidates Jagannath Sarkar (Shantipur) and Nisith Pramanik (Dinhata) had resigned as MLAs after being elected by the people. They had thought that they would become ministers after BJP wins in Bengal. But the party failed and they were no longer eager to continue," he said addressing a poll campaign rally here.The two resigned to retain their post as MPs. If they were so keen on holding on to their Lok Sabha seat, they should not have fought assembly election, Banerjee said.Pramanik was inducted to the central ministry as union minister of state for home and sports.By-election to two other seats - Gosaba and Khardah are being held following the death of their elected MLAs. "They (Sarkar and Pramanik) dishonoured the verdict of the people to retain their parliamentary berths. The BJP leaders used to visit Coochbehar regularly during the assembly poll but have stopped coming after their defeat. They had made false promises of a Narayani Sena in the central forces, but Mamata Banerjee has kept her promise of creating a Narayani battalion. This is the difference," the nephew of Mamata Banerjee pointed out.The TMC leader asserted that the party would make a "4-0 sweep" in the October 30 by-poll."The entire country is eagerly waiting for the by-poll result. People of the country want a leader like Mamata Banerjee. That is why they raised slogans such as 'Desh ki netri kaisi ho, Mamata didi jaisi ho'. Like the vaccines that fight Covid-19,  Mamata Banerjee is a vaccine against virus BJP,"  Elaborating, he said  "Just as we have to take two doses of the vaccine to fight Covid, the first jab against virus BJP will be on October 30 through your vote in the by-poll. The second dose to eradicate the virus BJP will be during the next Lok Sabha poll."  Banerjee contended that BJP is trying to win the by-election in Shantipur and Dinhata riding the wave created the recent communal violence in Bangladesh.  "The BJP leaders are saying that they will benefit from the violence against the minorities in Bangladesh. The BJP, which boasts of being the saviour and the flag bearer of Hindu religion, is trying to gain mileage from the communal violence in Bangladesh. What kind of Hindus are these BJP leaders who seek to gain mileage from the attack on fellow Hindus in Bangladesh?" he asked. BJP has kick started a high pitch campaign in Dinhata and Santipur in Coochbehar and Nadia districts which border Bangladesh and has highlighted the atrocities on Hindus in the neighbouring country.The two constituencies have a sizeable number of voters who trace their roots to Bangladesh. They had to leave erstwhile East Pakistan during partition in 1947 or its Liberation War in 1971. Both the seats were won by BJP in the April-May state poll on the party's CAA poll plank. Banerjee also hit out at Congress for failing to fight against BJP and claimed that the TMC supremo is emerging as the "undisputed leader" from Kashmir to Kanyakumari."There are several other national parties. But they have failed to put up a fight against the BJP. Congress has surrendered before the BJP in the last seven years. It is only TMC that has not bowed before the threats of the saffron camp," he said.The TMC leader asserted "We will never bow our heads - the more you threaten us, the more fearsome force we will turn into ... Mamata Banerjee is the spearhead to fight and defeat the Modi-Shah regime in the next general election," he asserted.TMC, he said, has already expanded its footprints in Tripura and Goa and is planning to venture out to a few other states in the days to come. "Our party is making its presence felt all over the country. We will win the Goa assembly poll in a few months and we will dislodge the BJP government in Tripura in 2023. Wherever BJP is in power, we will go there and fight against them," Banerjee said.

During the visit, Shah is likely to hold meetings with party leaders to discuss election strategy.Though the exact schedule of the visit, during which Shah may also address a public rally, has not been officially announced, but the speculation around Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya has also created a buzz in the political corridors of the state.Shah will hold separate meetings with Adityanath, key state leaders and office-bearers on election preparations and other issues. The focus will be on including beneficiaries of government schemes to first-time voters, intellectuals, minorities and women. In the membership drive, a target has been set to add 100 people to each booth.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-shah-to-launch-bjps-membership-drive-in-poll-bound-uttar-pradesh-on-october-29-329463

He spent about an hour in the police commissioner’s office.He later approached the Sahar police in Mumbai, seeking security whenever he comes to meet his wife, children, and mother-in-law, who live in the Sahar village here, officials said.Sail did not file any written complaint against anyone at the police station, but only approached the police for the purpose of his and his family’s security, they said.  Sail had told the press on Sunday that he feared a threat to his life and had claimed he could be harmed.Sail had claimed that Rs 25 crore was demanded by an official of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and other persons, including absconding witness K P Gosavi, to let off Aryan Khan in the cruise drugs case.He had said that he overheard Gosavi telling one Sam D’Souza over the phone, after Aryan Khan was brought to the NCB office following the October 3 raid, about a demand of Rs 25 crore and “to settle at Rs 18 crore as they have to give Rs eight crore to Sameer Wankhede”, the zonal director of NCB.He also claimed NCB officials had asked him to sign nine to ten blank papers.However, a senior NCB official had denied the allegations, terming them as “completely false and malicious”.Wankhede on Sunday wrote to Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale, seeking protection from likely legal action “being planned” against him by unknown persons to falsely frame him concerning an alleged vigilance-related issue.On Monday, the NCB and Wankhede approached a special court here against the allegations of extortion levelled against them in the cruise drugs seizure case.Wankhede in his affidavit submitted to the court refuted the allegations levelled against him, and claimed he was under a “lurking threat of arrest as it does not suit some vested interests for conducting an honest and impartial investigation”.The NCB and Wankhede in their affidavits, submitted to the court designated to hear cases related to the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS), also said the allegations against them were an attempt to create hurdles and scuttle the investigation in the case.The NCB in its affidavit sought that there should be no tampering with the evidence or investigation in the case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cruise-drugs-case-after-making-rs-25-crore-bribery-claim-ncb-witness-meets-senior-mumbai-cop-for-protection-329449

Earlier, they had jurisdiction of 15 km, there were incidents of firing in Balurghat or Cooch Behar. Now, they extended it to 50 km. This is an attempt to interfere into the federal structure of the country,” Banerjee said at an administrative review meeting here.“We do not have problems in the border areas and share very cordial relations (with neighbouring countries). There is no need to create this confusion. Law and order is a state subject. BSF must look after what they are responsible for and we will have total support for that,” she said.West Bengal shares an international border with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan.Banerjee had on Sunday appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately withdraw the Union Home Ministry’s notification that extended the jurisdiction of BSF. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/extension-of-bsfs-jurisdiction-attempt-to-interfere-with-federal-structure-mamata-329447

There may be differences in appearance and name, but from inside, we all are one,” Bhagwat said.Speaking at the event, yoga guru Ramdev stressed on values of unity, equality, freedom and universal brotherhood.

The result was an inundation of hate speech, misinformation and celebrations of violence, which were documented in an internal Facebook report published later that month,” the NYT report said.The documents are part of a larger cache of material collected by whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee who recently testified before the Senate about the company and its social media platforms.

A person accused of possessing even a small quantity of drugs is prosecuted and undergoes jail term. Section 27 of the Act prescribes imprisonment of up to one year or a fine of up to Rs 20,000, or both, for consumption of narcotics or psychotropic substance. At present, there is no immunity for the addict. The proviso is that the accused will be exempted if he volunteers to undergo rehabilitation in a government-run de-addiction centre.The ministry, on the other hand, has pitched for automatic and mandatory rehabilitation at the centres for the addicts accused of possessing small quantity for personal consumption. This would enable them to provide them with immunity.The ministry has recommended leniency in the law in the midst of actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan’s arrest under Section 27 of the NDPS Act. He is being prosecuted by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in the cruise drugs case.Recently, the ministry had undertaken a drive to increase the number of de-addiction centres and upgrade the existing ones.

Army Commanders’ Conference is an apex level biannual event which is held in April and October every year,” the Army said in a statement.The conference is an institutional platform for conceptual-level deliberations, culminating in making important policy decisions for the Indian Army.“The apex leadership of Indian Army will brainstorm on current and emerging security and administrative aspects to chart the future course for the Indian Army in the backdrop of the situation along the borders and challenges imposed by COVID-19 pandemic,” the Army said.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh is scheduled to address and interact with the top commanders of the 13 lakh-strong Army.Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh and Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari are also scheduled to address the senior leadership of the Indian Army on avenues for promoting tri-service synergy, the Army said.The Army commanders are also expected to deliberate on various reform measures recommended by separate internal committees, the people said.They said the discussions on the situation in eastern Ladakh and ways to further bolster India’s military preparedness in the region are likely to dominate the conference.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.The tension escalated following a deadly clash in the Galwan Valley on June 15 last year.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in the Gogra area in August and in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in February this year.The last round of military talks on October 10 ended in a stalemate, following which both sides blamed each other for the impasse.In a strong statement after the 13th round of talks, the Indian Army said the “constructive suggestions” made by it at the negotiations were neither agreeable to the Chinese side nor could Beijing provide any “forward-looking” proposals.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the LAC in the sensitive sector.

25-10-2021||Mumbai||NCB official demanded Rs 25 cr from Shah Rukh Khan to release Aryan, alleges witness; agency denies claim||In a new twist to the cruise drugs seizure case, an ‘independent witness’ on Sunday claimed that Rs 25 crore was demanded by an official of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) and other persons, including absconding witness K P Gosavi, to let off Aryan Khan, the son of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, who was arrested in the case.Prabhakar Sail, the ‘independent witness’, told media persons that he had overheard Gosavi telling one Sam D’Souza over the phone after Aryan Khan was brought to the NCB office after the October 3 raid about a demand of Rs 25 crore and to settle at Rs 18 crore as they “have to give Rs 8 crore to Sameer Wankhede”, the zonal director of NCB.He also claimed NCB officials had asked him to sign nine to ten blank papers.However, a senior NCB official denied the allegations, terming them as “completely false and malicious”.An NCB team led by Wankhede earlier this month allegedly seized drugs on board a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast, following which Aryan Khan was arrested on October 3. He is currently lodged in the Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai. His bail application is likely to be heard by the Bombay High Court on October 26.Sail is the personal bodyguard of Gosavi, who is absconding in a 2018 job cheating case.Sail, who had accompanied Gosavi on the night of the raid, said that after Aryan Khan was brought to the NCB office, Gosavi met D’Souza.Sail claimed he overheard Gosavi telling D’Souza over the phone about a demand of Rs 25 crore and to settle at Rs 18 crore as they “have to give Rs eight crore to Sameer Wankhede”.The NCB, while stating that Wankhede has categorically denied the allegations, also said that as the matter is sub judice, Sail should have submitted his prayer to the court if he had anything to say.Mumbai NCB’s Deputy Director General (DDG) Mutha Ashok Jain issued a statement saying that he came to know through social media that Sail is a witness in the case.“As he (Sail) is a witness in the case and the case is before the honourable court and is sub judice, he needs to submit his prayer to the court rather than through social media if he has anything to say,” the statement said.In addition, there are certain vigilance-related allegations against certain persons in the affidavit, which are based on overhearing by Prabhakar Sail, it said.“Zonal Director of Mumbai NCB Sameer Wankhede has categorically denied these allegations. As some of the contents of the affidavit are related to vigilance matter, we are hereby forwarding the affidavit to the Director General (DG) NCB and requesting him for further necessary action,” the statement added.Sail, who has prepared a notarized affidavit and claimed to have submitted in court, also said that Rs 50 lakh was delivered to Gosavi by two persons, and he later returned Rs 38 lakh.Sail stated that he reached the NCB office on October 2 morning and saw Gosavi getting down along with an NCB official. NCB zonal director Samir Wankhede also came out of the office, he claimed.Later in that afternoon, Gosavi sent 10-12 photographs on Sail’s mobile phone and asked him to identify if any of these persons coming to board the cruise ship through the green gate. Sail stated that he identified only Munmun Dhamecha.After the raid, Gosavi, accompanied by NCB officials, took Aryan Khan in a white Innova car to the NCB office. Sail stated he and D’souza followed Gosavi in another car.He claimed that D’Souza and Gosavi later went to Lower Parel, where a blue colour Mercedes car carrying Shah Rukh Khan’s manager Pooja Dadlani arived at a particular spot.
