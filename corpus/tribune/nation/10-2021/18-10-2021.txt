The Congress, with a leadership crisis, will always find itself on the fringes,” he tweeted.“The Family may enjoy these imaginary garlands of blandishment by Congress slaves, but India will not tolerate the insult of its greats, including the revered Sardar Patel,” he added.The Congress, Patra alleged, is reduced to being a party of a family and works to advance the family’s rule.“What sort of mindset is this that one family has done everything and others have done nothing. What the CWC has done is a sin,” he said.He noted that Karra also batted for Rahul Gandhi to take over as the Congress chief while lauding the contribution of the Nehru-Gandhi family and criticising Patel.“This is the height of sycophancy,” he said.

18-10-2021||Satya Prakash||SC frowns upon misuse of criminal proceedings in civil disputes||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 18Frowning upon the misuse of criminal law in disputes of civil nature, the Supreme Court has said criminal proceedings should not be allowed to be used as a weapon of harassment.“There can be no doubt that a complaint disclosing civil transactions may also have a criminal texture. The High Court has, however, to see whether the dispute of a civil nature has been given colour of criminal offence. In such a situation, the High Court should not hesitate to quash the criminal proceedings,” a Bench led by Justice Indira Banerjee said.Allowing an appeal filed by one Randheer Singh—a property purchaser—against an Allahabad High Court order refusing to quash criminal proceedings against him, the top court said the high court should examine if a complaint disclosed criminal offence or not.“Whether a complaint discloses a criminal offence or not depends on the nature of the allegation and whether the essential ingredients of a criminal offence are present or not has to be judged by the High Court,” the Bench—which also included Justice JK Maheshwari – clarified in an order last month.However, it said, “There can be no doubt that jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC should be used sparingly for the purpose of preventing abuse of the process of any court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice.”After examining the FIR, the top court noted, “In this case, it appears that criminal proceedings are being taken recourse to as a weapon of harassment against a purchaser (appellant).”“The FIR does not disclose any offence so far as the Appellant is concerned. There is no whisper of how and in what manner, this Appellant is involved in any criminal offence and the charge sheet… is absolutely vague,” it said, adding the other accused—Rajan Kumar – had also died.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-frowns-upon-misuse-of-criminal-proceedings-in-civil-disputes-326252

Consumers pick good ones and the rotten ones are left behind which is a loss to us. So, we keep rates in such a way to recover that loss also,” said a vegetable hawker Shiva Lal Yadav who sells in Karol Bagh colony of Delhi.Currently, harvesting is underway in key growing states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.Last week, Azadpur Tomato Association President Ashok Kaushik had said, “Unseasonal rains in producing states like Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra have damaged the crop due to which the supply to consuming markets like Delhi has been affected. This has led to a rise in prices both in wholesale and retail markets.”The tomato crop is ready for harvest in about 2-3 months after planting. Harvesting is done as per the requirement of the market.India, the world’s second-largest tomato producer after China, produces around 19.75 million tonnes from an area of 7.89 lakh hectares with an average yield of 25.05 tonnes per hectare, according to the National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation.

Angry farmers then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles. The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver.Farmers have claimed that Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish was in one of the vehicles, an allegation denied by him and his father who say they can produce evidence to prove he was at an event at that time. Ashish Mishra was arrested in the case on October 9.Security was deployed at rail stations in the wake of the protest.The ‘rail roko’ protest affected 150 locations in the Northern Railway zone and hindered the running of 60 trains, said its chief public relation officer (CPRO).In the North Western Railway (NWR) zone, rail traffic was affected in some sections in Rajasthan and Haryana with 18 trains cancelled, 10 partially cancelled and one diverted due to the protest.The trains that have been affected in the Northern Railway zone include the Chandigarh-Ferozepur Express.

18-10-2021||Chandigarh||IAF to refurbish its VVIP helicopter fleet||About five years after the IAF modified a batch of Russian Mi-17 V5 helicopters to meet the requirement of transporting VVIPs, the fleet of five choppers is now being refurbished and upgraded.The project involves an internal facelift of the modified cabin as well as replacement of accessories, fixtures, electrical items, panels and flooring and inspecting the avionics and other systems, IAF sources said.The project is being executed by No.3 Base Repair Depot (BRD), which is responsible for the maintenance and overhaul of Russian origin helicopters.According to IAF officers, the work of refurbishing the fleet is expected to begin in December and only one helicopter will be handled at a time. The entire work will take about six or seven months to complete.After the Mi-8 helicopters that were earlier used for VVIP transport exhausted their service lifespan and plans to replace them with 12 Italian Agusta Westland helicopters ran aground due to allegations of kickbacks, the IAF opted for modifying a few newly acquired M-17 V5s for the role.The modification included cabin refurbishment, furnishing, air-conditioning and soundproofing of the passenger cabin, fitting executive passenger seats as in commercial airliners, making provision for baggage compartments, a galley and a small toilet besides retrofitting the requisite security, communications and safety equipment. Some of the items were sourced from overseas.These helicopters form part of the Air Headquarters Communication Squadron, also known as Pegasus, based at Palam Air Force Station in Delhi. It operates a mix of fixed-wing and rotor wing aircraft for VVIP transport which include the IAF’s latest induction, the Boeing 777-300ER that flies with the call sigh Air India One when ferrying VVIPs such as the president, vice-president and prime minister. A sister aircraft is expected to join the fleet soon.Other aircraft in the 74-year-old squadron are three customized Boeing 737 business jets and four Embraer executive jets. Unlike the low-visibility grey drab worn by other IAF aircraft, those in service with the Communication Squadron wear a distinct white livery and are equipped with self-protection suites that include radar warning receivers, missile-approach warning and counter-measure systems such as chaff and flares.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iaf-to-refurbish-its-vvip-helicopter-fleet-326223

18-10-2021||Mumbai||ED issues fresh summons to Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawali for questioning on Oct 20||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has issued fresh summons to Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawali to appear before it on October 20 for questioning in a money laundering case registered against her and others, official sources said on Monday.The 48-year-old Gawali is a sitting Lok Sabha member from the Yavatmal-Washim constituency in Maharashtra. She was first summoned by the agency to appear on October 4 but she sought adjournment and a new date citing work commitments.The Shiv Sena MP has now been asked to depose before the investigating officer of the case at the ED office located in South Mumbai on October 20, they said.The agency in September had arrested her aide Saeed Khan in this criminal case filed under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The ED, while taking the custody of Khan, claimed before a special PMLA court that Gawali criminally conspired to convert a trust into a private company through Khan by “forgery and fraud” for layering of funds worth around Rs 18 crore.It is understood that the agency wants to question Gawali about her links with Khan and the trust identified as ‘Mahila Utkarsha Pratishthan’ and related transactions.The ED had told the court that its investigation done so far suggested that misappropriation of funds to the tune of Rs 18.18 crore and theft of Rs 7 crore (cash) have been layered.The agency said the trust filed for conversion into a Section 8 company by alleged fraudulent forgery of signatures of the management and documents from public institutions.The total assets of Rs 69 crore in the book value (of the trust) were transferred to the newly formed Section 8 company limited, the agency told the court.                         The Companies Act defines a Section 8 company as one whose objective is to promote fields of arts, commerce, science, research, education, sports, charity, social welfare, religion, environment protection, or other similar objectives.The directors of this company, as per the ED, are Khan and Shalinitai Gawali, the mother of the Sena MP.Bhavana Gawali along with the two is stated to be a member of this company.“It is stated that Bhavana Gawali, through her aide Saeed Khan, Shergul Khan and his accomplices have criminally conspired to convert the Trust ‘Mahila Utkarsha Pratishthan’ into a Section 8 company through forgery and fraud for the purpose of layering the trust fund,” the ED had said.Initial probe shows that there is a huge cash deposit and the withdrawal of bigger amounts from the account of the trust maintained at the Risod Urban cooperative society.    Then branch manager of Risod Urban cooperative society in his statement stated that the society was not entitled to receive a cash deposit of more than Rs 3 lakh.However, there are multiple cash deposits of much bigger amounts followed by the withdrawal of the same amount on the same day. He (the manager) also stated that these transactions were merely book entries and no physical cash was moved. This was all done on specific instructions of Bhavana Gawali, the ED claimed.Thus, it has come to light that the complaints alleging misappropriation of funds of Rs 18.18 crore and theft of Rs 7 crore (cash) are layered, the probe agency said.The ED counsel had claimed that Khan played an active role in forging documents and creating companies.Khan’s lawyer opposed the ED argument, and said, “Let them (ED) show if any money has come to my account...there is nothing against me ....I am targeted because I am affiliated to a state party.”      The ED case is based on an FIR registered by Risod police station in Washim district for cheating and criminal breach of trust.The agency had earlier conducted searches in this case at multiple premises in Yavatmal, Washim and Mumbai.

Punia said earlier also -- be it Sonbhadra, Unnao or Hathras incidents -- Priyanka Gandhi had fought for justice."So, the people are impressed by her and currently in the entire state, no politician is more popular than Priyanka Gandhi. As far as around whom the campaign will be centred, we are fortunate that Priyanka Gandhi is available for (campaigning) all the time," he said.There are always demands from other states for Priyanka Gandhi to campaign and hold one or two meetings, but in UP she is available 24X7, Punia said.Punia also said the Lakhimpur Kheri incident and justice for farmers would be important issues in the elections, asserting that the way the farmers were "trampled upon", was a condemnable incident."What was more appalling was that those in power gave protection to the perpetrators (of the crime). Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said no one will be arrested without evidence which was an indication that seeking arrest of the Union minister's son is wrong," Punia said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priyanka-gandhi-vadra-to-be-face-of-up-campaign-pl-punia-325901

The subject experts of the national drug regulator recently recommended the emergency use authorisation of Covaxin in 2 to 18-year-olds. The Drug Controller General of India’s approval is awaited.ZyCov-D was earlier approved by the drug regulator for emergency use in persons above 12 years. The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, India’s apex body guiding vaccine plans nationally, is currently studying how to roll out ZyCov-D and whether to prioritise adolescents (12 to 18-year-olds) for inoculation by first covering those with comorbid conditions.The US and UK were among the first countries to inoculate adolescents against Covid.The larger view in the research community is that children have greater natural immunity to viruses than adults and may therefore not need the same level of vaccine outreach as adults.The issue is being extensively researched worldwide.14,146 fresh casesTOTAL DEATHS 4,52,124ACTIVE CASES 1,95,846144 deaths in 24 hours||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-go-by-scientific-rationale-on-vaccination-for-kids-govt-325903
