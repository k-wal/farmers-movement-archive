09-10-2021||New Delhi||India doesn’t yet have that Covid safety armour needed to start reopening: Virologist Ian Lipkin||The percentage of India’s population vaccinated against Covid-19 is very low, renowned virologist Dr W. Ian Lipkin said on Saturday and opined the country does not yet have the sort of safety armour needed to start reopening.Addressing India Today Conclave 2021, he said India has the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world which the country should be proud of.“Serum Institute of India is poised to lead here. I think this is something that India should be proud of and should acknowledge and promote,” he said.About the reopening procedure, Lipkin said the percentage of India’s population that is vaccinated is very small.“Less than 20 per cent of your population that’s vaccinated. Then 30 per cent of your population under the age of 18 who are not yet eligible for vaccination. So this means that you don’t have the sort of armour that you need to safely reopen in that way,” he said.Warning about the long-term effect of Covid-19, the virologist said people usually don’t talk about it “which I think is going to be extraordinary in terms of its impact.“These are not people who necessarily have an acute disease, they may have an only mild form of it, but they remain permanently or at least for a long period, crippled with cognitive dysfunction, shortness of breath, fatigue. This can represent as many as 30 per cent of people who become infected,” Lipkin said.“These individuals, even if the virus were to magically disappear, might continue to be infected and have a huge impact on their lives for decades to come,” he said. Lipkin said there were many lessons from the Spanish flu of 1918 which have not been carried forward.“I hope we will revise our approach in the future. But I’m not even confident that this is the worst of potential pandemics. We need to make sure that whatever we’ve learned here carries forward into the next months and years,” he said.He warned there are several more variants of SARS-CoV-2 which are circulating.“There are variants, already circulating, don’t have names. Will they be more capable of transmission? We don’t know. Delta variant seems to be extraordinarily well adapted to spread in humans,” Lipkin said.He said the world needs to start thinking not only about vaccines to prevent severe disease, but also that can prevent transmission.“We need to improve our public health infrastructure, be able to track and trace individuals who have been exposed so that we can adopt a ring vaccination strategy, which was so successful in India in eradicating smallpox. “Masking, even if these masks are not what I would consider state-of-the-art can also be useful. But people need to change the way they think about themselves and others and be less selfish,” Lipkin added.

09-10-2021||Mumbai||Extortion case: Mumbai police ask Param Bir Singh to appear on October 12||Mumbai Police on Saturday pasted a notice outside the residence of IPS officer Param Bir Singh, asking him to appear before it in connection with an extortion case on October 12, an official said here.Recently, Maharashtra Home Minister Dilip Walse-Patil had said there were reports that Singh, a former Mumbai police commissioner who is now facing at least five criminal cases in the state, had left the country, but there was no confirmed information.The crime branch of Mumbai Police is probing an extortion case registered against Singh in suburban Goregaon and wanted to question him, the official said.A police team went to Singh’s flat in Nilima building in Malabar Hill area and pasted a notice outside as he was not there, the official added.The case was registered at Goregaon police station on the complaint of builder-cum-hotelier Bimal Agrawal. Besides Singh, dismissed police officer Sachin Waze, Sumit Singh alias Chintu, Alpesh Patel, Vinay Singh alias Babloo and Riyaz Bhati are named as accused in the FIR.Param Bir Singh was shunted out as Mumbai police chief and transferred to the Home Guard after Sachin Waze’s arrest in the case of an SUV with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence.Singh later accused then state home minister Anil Deshmukh of asking Waze to collect Rs 100 crore from hotels and bars in Mumbai every month, a charge which Deshmukh denied.Subsequently, while Deshmukh resigned, police registered four cases of alleged extortion against Singh in Mumbai and Thane. Also, a case under SC-ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act is pending against him.In the last few weeks the IPS officer has not been found at his residence in Mumbai or other known addresses, including one in Chandigarh, police sources said.

The summons was sent by email, he added.The case relates to the ‘leak’ of a report prepared by IPS officer Rashmi Shukla about alleged corruption in police transfers in Maharashtra when she headed the state intelligence department (SID). Jaiswal was the director general of police during this period.It was alleged that phones of senior politicians and officials were tapped illegally during the inquiry and the report was leaked deliberately, but the FIR registered in this regard by the cyber cell does not name Shukla or any other official.Officials of the BKC cyber police station had earlier recorded Shukla’s statement.Shukla is now posted as Additional Director General of CRPF.The FIR was registered against unknown persons for obtaining “a classified letter and classified information” of the SID under section 30 of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 (fraudulently retaining a message delivered by mistake), sections 44(b) (failure to furnish information in time) and 66 (computer-related offence) of the Information Technology Act, 2008, and section 5 (wrongful communication of information) of the Official Secrets Act, 1923.Jaiswal, a 1985 Maharashtra-cadre IPS officer, has also served as Mumbai police commissioner in the past.

Considering all these aspects, the bail applications filed by the accused are not maintainable before this court. The same are required to be rejected," he added. When the matter came up for hearing earlier on Friday, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh had challenged the bail pleas claiming the magistrate court had no jurisdiction to hear such applications in this matter. A lawyer said Khan, Merchant and Dhamecha are likely to move the Sessions court for bail on Monday. The three and others were held after the NCB raided a Goa-bound cruise ship on the evening of October 2. Meanwhile, the magistrate court on Saturday sent Achit Kumar, who was held based on the statement of Khan and Merchant, to judicial custody. The NCB has claimed Kumar used to supply drugs to the duo. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drug-case-no-jurisdiction-says-court-that-rejected-bail-pleas-of-aryan-khan-two-others-322397

09-10-2021||Lucknow||BSP’s right turn: Mayawati promises no derailment of BJP’s work in Mathura, Kashi and Ayodhya||BSP supremo Mayawati on Saturday promised not to derail the ongoing work of the BJP government in “Ayodhya, Varanasi, Mathura and other religious places”, if voted to power.Claiming that the BJP’s government’s works in the three holy cities are only the follow-ups of her government’s initiatives, Mayawati went on to promise, in what is being seen as a subtle shift towards soft Hindutva ahead of the Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, to complete all those work on time.She made the promise while addressing the 15th death anniversary of BSP founder Kanshi Ram here and asserting that if voted to power, she will not indulge in misappropriating the credit for work done by the preceding governments like the SP and the BJP regimes.“The BSP, if voted to power, will not stop the developmental work of the current BJP government, which followed the footsteps of the BSP, in Ayodhya, Varanasi, Mathura and other religious places,” said Mayawati.“The unfinished works will not be stopped with a feeling of vengeance but will be completed,” she promised.“The drama of changing names of the work done by other governments will not be done by the BSP like the Samajwadi Party and the Bhartiya Janata Party did,” she said.“All the works of their governments will be honestly reviewed. The work which is appropriate and in the public interest will definitely be taken ahead and finished on time,” she added.Apart from the construction of a massive Lord Rama temple, a multi-pronged developmental work, including the construction of an international airport, is going in Ayodhya.Developmental work in form of the construction of the Kashi Vishvanath corridor project is going on in Varanasi while several beautification projects have been undertaken for Mathura and Vrindavan.Earlier while addressing a Brahmins conclave organised by the party on September 7, Mayawati had also promised that rather than building statues and memorials, she would, if voted power, focus on changing the face of Uttar Pradesh through developmental works.In the run-up to the Punjab assembly elections, which the BSP has decided to fight in alliance with Shiromani Akali Dal, Mayawati also took a dig at the Congress over the appointment of an SC chief minister in the state.“Despite trumpeting about making a SC the Punjab chief minister and dramatics to woo the Sikhs, people of that community cannot forget the pain of the anti-Sikh riots under its rule,” she said.She also lashed at the Aam Aadmi Party accusing its government in Delhi of doing little in facilitating the movement of UP-bound migrant workers to their native state during the Covid lockdown.She also dismissed the AAP’s promise of providing free power and water in UP and Punjab as “promises made in air”.Addressing the function at Kanshi Ram Smarak Sthal, the BSP chief also demanded a Bharat Ratna the BSP founder.Insinuating that media houses take up pre-poll surveys only to influence popular mandate, Mayawati said she would soon write to the Election Commission of India to ban pre-poll surveys by media for at least six months before the elections.Mayawati’s remarks came a day after a news channel survey showed that the BJP is poised to win most of the UP assembly seats in 2022 and retain power.She also alleged that the BJP-led Centre and UP governments were misusing the state machinery to make the atmosphere in their favour for the elections in the most populous state.“It is known to everyone that when these tactics do not work, the BJP will eventually give the election a Hindu-Muslim colour and try to take full political advantage in its garb. Elections have to be fought keeping this in mind,” she said.Taking on the AAP for its pre-poll promises of providing free water and power etc in UP, Mayawati said, “The BJP, SP and Congress along with the AAP, Shiv Sena and party of (Asaduddin) Owaisi are making various types of promises to the people of the state to get votes.” “There is no strength in these promises. This time, all the political parties are going to make more lucrative promises in their election manifesto. The people of the state should never be misled by those promises,” she said.Elections for the 403-member UP assembly is scheduled for early next year.

09-10-2021||New Delhi||Actor Leena Maria Paul, spouse Sukesh Chandrasekhar sent to ED custody in money-laundering case||A Delhi court on Saturday sent actor Leena Maria Paul and her boyfriend Sukesh Chandrasekhar to Enforcement Directorate’s custody for three days in a money-laundering case involving extortion of Rs 200 crore from a businessman’s wife here.The couple allegedly duped former Fortis Healthcare promoter Shivinder Mohan Singh’s wife Aditi Singh.Earlier in the day, the ED placed Chandrashekar and Paul, already in jail after being arrested by the Delhi Police on charges of cheating people and committing fraud, under arrest under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.In its application in the court, the Enforcement Directorate’s special public prosecutor Atul Tripathi claimed that 14-day custodial interrogation of the accused was essential to determine the role of other people who facilitated money laundering, how and by whom proceeds of crime were placed, layered and integrated into the system.The ED claimed that the accused were deliberately withholding evidence, and their custodial interrogation was essential to establish a money trail of proceeds of the crime.They were to be confronted with the evidence on record and the voluminous documents as well as various related persons, which would enable the probe agency to ascertain and identify the funds laundered, it said.“Their custodial interrogation is, therefore, required for an effective investigation of the case to bring the instant case to a logical conclusion,” the probe agency stated.Special Judge Anil Antil passed the order remanding the couple to three days in ED custody and said, “From the record, it is apparent that accused Chandrashekar and Paul are the kingpins of the alleged crime committed by them.”“Therefore, appreciating the facts and circumstances of the case, in my considered opinion, I find that a case of remanding accused Sukesh Chandrashekar and Leena Maria Paul to ED custody is made out,” the judge said.The case was filed based on an FIR lodged by the Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing on Aditi Singh’s complaint that a man posing as a senior official of the Law Ministry in June last year had offered to help secure bail for her husband, who was in jail at that time, in return for money.Shivinder Singh was arrested for alleged misappropriation of funds at Religare Finvest Ltd in 2019.According to the police, Chandrasekhar, an accused in 21 cases, including the Election Commission bribery case, had made the call to Aditi Singh. He was arrested in August.At the time of the incident, Chandrasekhar was lodged in Delhi’s Rohini jail and was running an extortion racket from behind the bars. The police later arrested his two associates, who ran operations for him from outside the prison, and two senior officials of the Rohini jail for aiding Chandrasekhar.During the investigation, the police had found that a manager of a bank in Connaught Place and his two associates were involved in dubious transactions for circulation of funds and arrangement of cash. The three were arrested.In August, the ED had raided some of Chandrashekhar’s premises and seized a sea-facing bungalow in Chennai, Rs 82.5 lakh in cash and over a dozen luxurious cars.It had claimed that Chandrashekhar is a “known conman” and is being probed by the Delhi Police in a case of alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating and extortion to the tune of about Rs 200 crore.“Chandrasekhar is the mastermind of this fraud. He has been part of the crime world since the age of 17. He has multiple FIRs against him and is presently lodged in Rohini jail (in connection with the Delhi Police case),” the ED had said.It had also recorded the statement of actor Jacqueline Fernandez in this case.

09-10-2021||New Delhi||Old Parliament ‘unsafe’; new building, Central Vista Avenue to be completed on time: Hardeep Singh Puri||Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Saturday the construction of a new Parliament building and redevelopment of the Central Vista Avenue, stretching from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate, will be completed in a time-bound manner.Both these projects are being executed as part of the Modi government’s ambitious Central Vista redevelopment plan.Stressing upon the need for a new Parliament building, the Union housing and urban affairs minister said that the current one is “unsafe” as when it had been constructed, it was in Seismic Zone II, but now that area lies in Seismic Zone IV.During an interaction at the ‘India Today Conclave 2021’, Puri said that the existing building, which doesn’t have the capacity to accommodate more parliamentarians, was never designed to be Parliament and it was a council house of a colonial power.“The number of members (parliamentarians) has been increasing since we became an Independent country. So, there have been a lot of internal adjustments and new facilities have been added...from a purely structural point of view, it is an unsafe building.“When the building was constructed, it was in Seismic Zone II and today, that area is in Seismic Zone IV. It is not an exaggeration. We don’t want to create panic, but you know you are above pushing the limit,” he said.The redevelopment of the Central Vista envisages a new Parliament building, a common central secretariat, revamping of the 3-km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate, a new Prime Minister’s residence and office, and a new Vice President’s Enclave.Tata Projects Limited has been constructing a new Parliament building near the existing one under the Central Vista redevelopment project.The government said that the winter session of Parliament in December next year will be held in the new building.Shapoorji Pallonji and Co Pvt Ltd has been executing the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue stretching from Rashtrapati Bhavan to the India Gate. The government plans to hold the Republic Day parade on the revamped Rajpath next year.“These two segments are actually the showcase segment (of the Central Vista redevelopment project),” he said, adding that these two projects will be completed within the time period.Besides, the government had floated tenders for the construction of three new buildings of Common Central Secretariat on the plot where the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts is currently located. Last month, four infrastructure firms—Tata Projects Limited, Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Ltd, L&T Construction, and NCC Ltd—had submitted technical bids for the project. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/old-parliament-unsafe-new-building-central-vista-avenue-to-be-completed-on-time-hardeep-singh-puri-322378
09-10-2021||Mumbai||Cruise drugs case: NCB says it doesn’t see political affiliation or religion, dismisses ‘motivated’ allegations||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Saturday said all the allegations levelled against the agency in connection with the cruise ship raid and alleged recovery of drugs, in which Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan was arrested, are “baseless, motivated afterthoughts and prejudicial”.NCB Director, Mumbai Zone, Sameer Wankhede said the anti-drugs agency works professionally. “We do not see any political party and religion. We do our job professionally,” he added.Based on a tip-off, an NCB team raided the Goa-bound cruise ship last Saturday and claimed to have recovered banned drugs. A total of 18 persons have been arrested in the case, including Aryan Khan.The incident took a political turn when Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Wednesday claimed that the raid was “fake” and that “outsiders” were involved in it.On Saturday, Malik alleged that the NCB had initially detained 11 persons from the Goa-bound cruise ship, but let off three of them, including the brother-in-law of BJP leader Mohit Bharatiya, a couple of hours later.A senior NCB official told mediapersons on Saturday that the two men, whom Malik had claimed as “outsiders” involved in the raid, were actually among the nine independent witnesses involved in the operation. He said the duo was not known to the NCB before October 2, when the raid was conducted.NCB Deputy Director General Gyaneshwar Singh told reporters that such statements are based on conjecture and assumptions.“These assumptions are frivolous and malicious in view of documents and records of procedures duly followed by the NCB that can subject to legal verification. The NCB reiterates that its procedure has been and will continue to be professionally and legally transparent and unbiased as all the suspect/accused persons have been treated at par and in accordance with the law,” he said.When asked about allegations, Singh said he will not comment on what other people are saying about the NCB.“The NCB is a responsible organisation. Whatever we say, we say it based on the proofs and evidence. We are doing our work honestly and dedicatedly,” he said.Singh said independent public witnesses are mandatorily required to be present during any seizure operations as per the set legal procedure.Malik had claimed that a man named (K P) ‘Gosavi’, who is seen escorting Aryan Khan in one of the videos, was not an NCB official, and his social media profile states that he is a private detective based in Kuala Lumpur.He had also said that two men were seen escorting Arbaaz Merchant, also arrested in the case, in another video, and one of them is a member of the BJP, (later identified as Manish Bhanushali).Singh said the NCB strongly adheres to the legal procedure and involves at least two independent witnesses in all its seizure operations.“As the operations are conducted on a real-time basis, so the field verification of independent witnesses is not possible as the main focus is on drug recovery,” he said.Singh said a total of nine independent witnesses were involved in the whole operation (cruise ship raid) and Manish Bhanushali and K P Gosavi were among them. “None of the Independent witnesses, including the two (Bhanushhali and Gosavi) were known to the NCB before October 2,” he said.Later in a statement, Singh said a total of 14 persons were brought to the NCB zonal office (in Mumbai) for examination.“All of them were served notice under section 67, examined thoroughly and their statements were recorded,” Singh said.Eight persons were arrested and the remaining six persons were let off since no incriminating evidence was found against them, he stated and added that the other six “can be associated if the need arises in the investigation as per law”.As panchnamas were made at the respective spots, hence the place, timing, situation and resources may differ, he added.Singh stated that these documents are a matter of court record and have been produced in the court and will be part of a charge sheet in future. “Hence all such documents are part of a transparent legal procedure open to scrutiny at appropriate fora,” he added.Meanwhile, Sameer Wankhede said those are the independent witnesses.“Whatever they (who are raising allegations) want to say let them say. We will speak before the court,” he said without taking any names.Wankhede said the case is sub-judice and the investigation is underway. The NCB will follow the orders of the court, he added.“The NCB is an independent and professional agency. We did not see any political party and religion and we do our job professionally,” he added.On Friday, a metropolitan magistrate’s court in Mumbai rejected bail applications of Aryan Khan and two others, following which he was sent to the Arthur Road prison.

09-10-2021||Bahraich||Bahraich admin reaches out to Sikhs, writes to them in Gurmukhi script||The district administration here reached out to Sikhs through a letter in Gurmukhi script, thanking them for maintaining restraint after the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, which claimed eight lives, including four members from the community.Two Sikh farmers from the district and two from Lakhimpur Kheri were killed in the violence and the initiative by the administration is being seen as an attempt to placate members of the community.District Magistrate Dinesh Chandra Singh claimed that the initiative may not have reduced the sorrow of the victims’ families but they felt affinity towards the administration.Apart from the community members living in Bahraich, the letter is also being sent digitally to Sikhs residing in other districts.The letter reads, “The October 3 incident, which took place in Lakhimpur Kheri, has been condemned by all—the government and the citizens. The government, police and administration are making efforts to give justice.”“Public representatives and common people of the district and those coming from outside, should exercise restraint while offering condolences,” it read.“Thanks to all Sikh brothers and sisters for maintaining restraint and co-operating with the government and administration due to which an atmosphere of peace and amity prevailed,” the administration said in the letter.Meanwhile, the chief “granthi” of the Bahraich gurdwara, Gyani Vikram Singh, said the district administration associating with the language is a good messaging.

There is no doubt in my mind that the Supreme Court’s intervention has been remarkable and is absolutely essential, done at the right time,” Dave said on being asked about the Lakhimpur Kheri case during the interview to the news website.In the hearing on October 8, Justice Ramana-led bench said, “The law must take its course against all accused and the government has to take all remedial steps in this regard to inspire confidence in the investigation of brutal murder of eight persons.”                 Dave lauded the apex court, saying that it achieved a lot without passing any orders against the Uttar Pradesh government by clearly indicating that it is displeased with what has happened, and therefore “if the government does not act, it will pass further orders”.The senior advocate further said the Uttar Pradesh government and the Director General of Police, in particular, have been told very firmly what the court expects of them.The top court has posted the matter for hearing on October 20.Four farmers were mowed down by an SUV in Lakhimpur Kheri when a group agitating against the Centre’s three new farm laws was demonstrating against the visit of UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya on October 3.Two BJP workers and a driver were allegedly beaten to death by the angry protesters, while a local journalist was also killed in the violence.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-violence-dushyant-dave-praises-cji-ramana-for-remarkable-intervention-322370
09-10-2021||New Delhi||Killing of BJP workers in Lakhimpur after car ran over farmers reaction to action: Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait on Saturday said that he doesn’t consider those who killed BJP workers in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri as culprits as they only reacted to SUV running over protesters.Eight people were killed in the violence that broke out on October 3 after an SUV allegedly ran over a group of anti-farm law protesters who were demonstrating against the visit of Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya at Tikonia-Banbirpur road in Lakhimpur Kheri.The dead included farmers, BJP workers and a journalist.“The killing of two BJP workers in Lakhimpur Kheri after a convoy of cars mowed down four farmers is a reaction to an action. I do not consider those involved in the killings as culprits,” Tikait said in reply to a question asked during a press conference here.Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) leader Yogendra Yadav said: “We are sad over the loss of lives, be it BJP workers or farmers. It was unfortunate and we hope justice is done”.Farmer leaders on Saturday demanded that Union Minister Ajay Mishra and his son be arrested in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case, and said the incident was a “pre-planned conspiracy”.Ajay Mishra should also be removed from the government as he started this conspiracy and is also protecting the culprits in the case, Yadav alleged during the press conference here.He also said that the SKM on October 15, which is Dusshera, will burn the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah to protest against the violence. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/killing-of-bjp-workers-in-lakhimpur-after-car-ran-over-farmers-reaction-to-action-tikait-322361
09-10-2021||Shillong||Sikh outfit in Shillong opposes relocation of ‘illegal settlers’||Days after the Meghalaya Cabinet approved a proposal to relocate “illegal settlers” from Them lew Mawlong area here, the Harijan Panchayat Committee (HPC), which represents members of the Dalit Sikh community in Shillong, has said that it will “fight tooth and nail” to stop the government from carrying out the drive.The state Cabinet took the decision earlier this week, based on a recommendations made by a high-level committee (HLC) headed by Deputy Chief Minister Prestone Tynsong.“The HPC, which represents the interests of hundreds of Dalit Sikh families living in Them lew Mawlong area or Punjabi Lane for the past many years, has rejected the report of the high-level committee,” its secretary Gurjit Singh told PTI on Saturday.Singh also said that his organisation has vowed to the “fight tooth and nail for the rights of people residing in the area till their last breath”.“The 2.5-acre colony land, located close to the state’s biggest traditional market, serves as lifeline to many families, who have set up shops and other businesses in the area.“We will die for our land but won’t allow any illegal, unlawful, unethical and unjust action by the Meghalaya government,” Singh maintained.He further claimed that the land was gifted to the Punjabis by the chief of Hima Mylliem – one of the chiefdoms in Khasi Hills.“No one else has right to this land,” Singh added.Laws in Meghalaya bar non-tribals from owning properties in scheduled areas.Among other recommendations, the government-constituted HLC suggested shifting of employees of Shillong Municipal Board (SMB) and other line departments, who reside in Them lew Mawlong, to their respective official quarters across Shillong.The HLC was constituted in 2018 by the Conrad Sangma-led government to settle a land dispute.Violence had broken out in the area in June that year following an alleged attack on a bus driver. It led to circulation of rumours on social media and Internet services were subsequently withdrawn in that locality for a few weeks.

09-10-2021||New Delhi||Samyukt Kisan Morcha demands dismissal and arrest of Union minister Ajay Mishra and arrest of his son||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha on Saturday demanded the dismissal and arrest of Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra Teni and the arrest of his son Ashish Mishra, terming the Lakhimpur Kheri “massacre” a “terror attack”, a “pre-planned conspiracy” against farmers”.“The BJP wants to force farmers to use violence but we will continue to use non-violent methods,” SKM leaders said, taking the centre stage in the Press Club of India.   SKM leader Yogendra Yadav said unless the minister of state is “dismissed from the cabinet and arrested on charges of spreading disharmony, murder and conspiracy”, he will continue to “protect culprits in the case”.Dashan Pal, the convener of the coordination committee of the umbrella body of farmer organisations spearheading the stir against the farm laws, said Lakhimpur Kheri “violence should not be seen in isolation as it was a part of larger conspiracy against farmers’ and the ongoing struggle”.Also read: Lakhimpur Kheri Violence: Union minister’s son Ashish Mishra appears before UP PoliceThe SKM also decided to burn the effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and any "local leader" on Dusshera."Some of the members wanted to burn the effigy of Manohar Lal Khattar, some of Yogi Adityanath, so we decided that the third effigy could be of any local leader," Yadav said.Opinions page: Medieval barbarismLakhimpur Kheri tragedy hardens battle linesAlso read: Why are you silent on Lakhimpur incident, Kapil Sibal asks PM Modi“Some of the members (of the SKM) were of the opinion that effigies of (Haryana CM) Manohar Lal Khattar or (Uttar Pradesh CM) Yogi Adityanath should also be burnt, therefore we decided that farmers can chose…it can be any local villain, local leader,” Yadav said.The plan includes an ‘antim ardas’/‘bhog’ for farmers killed at Tikonia on October 12, a countrywide ‘rail roko’ on October 18 and a ‘mahapanchayat’ in Lucknow on October 26. After the ‘antim ardas’, the SKM is also planning to start a ‘Shaheed Kisan Yatra’ from Lakhimpur Kheri, carrying ‘asthis’. SKM leaders asked supporters to either come to Lakhimpur Kheri for the ‘antim ardaas’ or hold prayers in their local gurdwara, temple, mosque, church, toll plaza, morchas. “If this is not possible people can light five candles in the evening memory of four farmers and a journalist”, said Yadav.Yadav said the programme for ‘antim ardas’ is final but the rest depends upon whether the government agrees to their three key demands-dismissal of Ajay Mishra, his arrest and that of his son. “If our demands are not met, we will announce the schedule of the remaining plan,” Yadav said.BKU leader Rakesh Tikait criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his “silence”, in response to opposition leaders who reached Lakhimpur Kheri to console the families. The incident has “completely exposed the character of the BJP government in Centre and state”, SKM leaders said.Joginder Singh, president of BKU (Ugrahan), said the agitation is going on peacefully, but BJP governments were trying to discredit it.“They (BJP) associated it with ‘Khalistanis’, ‘Pakistan-China’, labelled us anti-national, but failed. Now, they are trying this new game, which is violence, and this is dangerous. The BJP wants to force the farmers to use violence,” he said.Tikait said he did not regard those who killed BJP workers as culprits as they only reacted to SUV running over protesters.“The killing of two BJP workers in Lakhimpur Kheri after a convoy of cars mowed down four farmers is a reaction to an action. I do not consider those involved in the killings as culprits,” he said. Yadav said: “We are sad over the loss of lives, be it BJP workers or farmers. It was unfortunate and we hope justice is done”.Regarding allegations of him being a “BJP agent” for striking an “understanding/settlement” between farmers and the BJP government after the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, Tikait said dead bodies had to be cremated and on this everyone, including the families of victims, were in agreement. “Dead bodies were lying without last rites… How long could that continue? Our settlement will be on the dismissal and arrest of (union minister) Ajay Mishra Teni and the arrest of his son (Ashish Mishra),” he said.5-point campaign||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/samyukt-kisan-morcha-demands-dismissal-and-arrest-of-union-minister-ajay-mishra-and-arrest-of-his-son-322344
09-10-2021||Washington||India, US discuss Indo-Pacific, regional issues ahead of 2+2 Dialogue||India and the US have discussed their flourishing defence partnership and opportunities for enhanced cooperation with like-minded partners to sustain a free and open Indo-Pacific as officials from the two countries held a meeting to lay the groundwork for the key 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue later this year, the Pentagon has said.The meeting was co-chaired by Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar and US Under Secretary of Defence for Policy Colin Kahl on Friday.The Pentagon said that the 16th US-India Defence Policy Group meeting laid the groundwork for an important 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue later this year, as the US and India opened a new chapter in the Major Defence Partnership.“The Dialogue advanced an ambitious set of bilateral priorities—including information-sharing, high-end maritime cooperation, logistics and defence trade—reflective of the flourishing defense ties between the United States and India,” said Defense Department Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Anton T Semelroth.US and Indian officials exchanged views on regional issues of shared interest, including in South Asia and the Indian Ocean Region, he said.They also discussed opportunities for enhanced cooperation with like-minded partners to sustain a free and open Indo-Pacific, the official said.“The leaders reinforced their commitment to deepening joint cooperation and interoperability between the US and Indian militaries to work more seamlessly together, including strengthening cooperation in new defence domains, such as space and cyber,” Semelroth added.The 2+2 dialogue between India and the US would be held in November this year, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla had said last month.The last meeting of the 2+2 was held in New Delhi and the next meeting is to be hosted by the US. The dialogue takes place between foreign and defence ministers of both sides.On September 24, US President Joe Biden hosted the first-ever in-person summit of Quad leaders that vowed to strive for an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, inclusive, anchored by democratic values and unconstrained by coercion, sending an apparent message to China.China claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are also vital to global trade.At President Biden’ invitation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterparts Scott Morrison from Australia and Yoshihide Suga from Japan attended the first in-person Quad summit during which they announced a slew of new initiatives to take on common challenges, amidst muscle flexing by an assertive China in the strategic region.In 2016, the United States designated India as a Major Defence Partner.Commensurate with this designation, in 2018, India was elevated to Strategic Trade Authorisation tier 1 status, which allows India to receive license-free access to a wide range of military and dual-use technologies regulated by the Department of Commerce.US-India defense trade cooperation continues to expand with the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement, Communications, Compatibility and Security Agreement and the Industrial Security Agreement now in place.The Bureau of Political-Military Affairs supported the increase in total defense trade with India from near zero in 2008 to over USD 20 billion in 2020, according to the State Department PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-discuss-indo-pacific-regional-issues-ahead-of-22-dialogue-322332

However, with the introduction of vaccines, there is hope that we will finally be able to turn the corner…The message to the world is for the international community to come together to combat the pandemic and build a resilient system that will drive our recovery,” he said.“Terrorism, hate, radicalisation and extremism, infodemic and challenges to pluralism, human rights and democracy have only increased.“We can never truly put our countries on the path to recovery unless we combat these wholeheartedly and purposefully and call out those who seek to justify these acts,” Tirumurti said.Without naming any country, he underlined that "India will be at the forefront to ensure those supporting terrorism, violent extremism, radicalisation among others do not waylay us on our collective path to resilience and recovery.”The United States, India and Afghanistan have long accused Pakistan of providing safe havens to terror groups like the Taliban, the Haqqani network, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).

However, we have faced a significant number of challenges linked to the seas," he said during his speech at the Investiture Ceremony of the Indian Coast Guard (ICG).These challenges have taught us that without ensuring maritime security, it is not possible to create a comprehensive internal and external security framework, the minister said."Our security requirements, environmental health and economic development are ensured by keeping India's maritime zones safe, secure and pollution-free. I am really happy to say that the ICG is addressing all these challenges successfully," he noted.India is very quickly moving on the path of development and unhindered maritime access is one of its primary requirements, he said."Our prosperity is largely linked to our seas since we are an arriving maritime power. That is why security and development of not just ourselves but of countries in the entire region is our primary aim," Singh mentioned.According to the vision of the Indian government, the ICG has been at the forefront in promoting regional cooperation, maintaining peace in the Indian Ocean region, and working with international maritime agencies, he stated."I am really happy to say that the ICG's gallant acts to ensure the maritime security has not only affected our region but our neighbourhood too. Each of your successful missions show your efficiency and your effective response," Singh added.

However, with the introduction of vaccines, there is hope that we will finally be able to turn the corner,” he said while speaking at the UN General Assembly General Debate of the Second Committee on ‘Crisis, Resilience and Recovery – Accelerating Progress towards the 2030 Agenda'.“As Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi mentioned, we will resume this and work closely with other partners to end this pandemic. For this, the supply chains of raw materials must be kept open. We will ramp up production capacity as new Indian vaccines come on stream,” Tirumurti said.India will resume the export of surplus Covid vaccines in the fourth quarter of 2021 under the ‘Vaccine Maitri' programme and to meet its commitment to the COVAX global pool.The government had stopped the export of Covid vaccines after the second wave of the pandemic hit the country in April. India has exported over 66 million vaccine doses to nearly 100 countries through grants, commercial shipments and the COVAX facility.During his address to world leaders at the high-level General Assembly session last month, Modi had said that India is engaged in vaccination development and manufacturing despite limited resources.India's digital vaccine delivery platform CoWIN has supported its vaccine drive, Tirumurti said, adding that Modi has announced that India has offered this CoWIN platform to the world as a global public good.

The local sentiment has been severely hurt by the continuing miscarriage of justice and this is not acceptable. We are all gearing for a long haul unless culprits are brought to book,” says Pargat Singh of Tikonia, who was part of the October 3 protests.The farm bodies have given the BJP government at the Centre and UP police time until October 12 to sack Mishra and nab his son. Sensing latent anxieties, the security was enhanced multifold at several sites.

On an emotional note, Air India, under the leadership of Mr JRD Tata had, at one time, gained the reputation of being one of the most prestigious Airlines in the world. Tatas will have the opportunity of regaining the image and reputation it enjoyed in earlier years. Mr JRD Tata would have been overjoyed if he was in our midst today.”He went on to add: “We also need to recognise and thank the government for its recent policy of opening select industries to the private sector.”JRD Tata founded the airline in 1932. It was called Tata Airlines then. In 1946, the aviation division of Tata Sons was listed as Air India. In 1953, Air India was nationalised.Meanwhile, Pandey informed that as on August 31, 2021, Air India had a total debt of Rs 61,562 crore, out of that Rs 15,300 crore would be taken over by the bidder and Rs 46,262 crore would be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Limited (AIAHL). The AIAHL is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) formed by the government.Civil Aviation Secretary Rajiv Bansal said the winning bidder would not retrench any employee for a minimum period of one year and if retrenched after a year, they would have to be offered VRS (voluntary retirement scheme). Gratuity and Provident Fund (PF) benefits would be provided to all employees, he added.Bansal also mentioned, “As of today, there are 12,085 employees in Air India. Out of them, 8,084 are permanent and 4,001 contractual. Besides this, Air India Express has an employee strength of 1,434.”In December 2020, the government invited expressions of interest for the divestment of Air India. Four bidders entered the race, with the Tatas and SpiceJet’s Ajay Singh-led consortium making it to the final stages.This was the second attempt by the Narendra Modi government to sell Air India. The first attempt was made in March 2018 but its expression of interest —- to sell 76 per cent stake —- had no takers over concerns regarding the airline’s burgeoning debt.Rs 18,000-cr winning bidGovt reserve price: Rs12,906 crTata Sons’ bid: Rs18,000 crSpiceJet’s Ajay Singh-led consortium’s bid: Rs15,100 crGovt to receive in cash: Rs2,700 crAI’s total debt burden: Rs61,562 crTo be borne by Tatas: Rs15,300 crAir India Assets Holding Limited to handle AI debt: Rs46,262 crAIAHL to get AI’s non-core assets: Rs14,718 cr (not part of bid transaction)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-india-back-with-tatas-after-68-years-321977

Is this the same way we treat other accused too — like sending notices, etc,” the Bench, that also included Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli, asked senior advocate Harish Salve (who represented UP), hinting at handing over the probe to an agency other than the CBI.Asking the DGP to ensure that the evidence was not destroyed by the time another agency took over the investigation, the Bench posted the matter for October 20. The “proof of the pudding is in the eating”, the Bench observed after Salve said some arrests had been made and a notice sent to accused Ashish Mishra, asking him to join the probe on Saturday. Terming the murder of eight people as “brutal”, the Bench said, “If a Section 302 (murder) case is registered, the accused has to be apprehended immediately... The law must take its own course against all accused. Whatever has been done so far is not satisfactory. They (UP Police) should have done the needful.” Salve conceded that not enough had been done by the authorities.Going through the composition of SIT, which includes the DIG, SP and circle officers, the Bench noted that most of them were local officers. As the Bench asked if there was any request by the state to hand this over to the CBI, Salve replied: “It’s entirely in your Lordship’s hand....If you are not satisfied with the progress... hand it over to the CBI.” The top court, however, wasn’t receptive to the idea.“Because of the sensitivity of the issue, we are not commenting. The CBI is not a solution for reasons known to you…because of the persons.... it’s better you find some other mode,” the CJI said.As Salve said the postmortem did not show gunshot injury, the Bench shot back, “So this is a ground for not taking custody of the accused?” The Bench took exception to certain TV news channel claiming the CJI had met a victim’s family. “We are sorry to see how the media is exceeding freedom of speech and expression. The CJI is gracious enough to let this go, ” Justice Surya Kant said.Minister’s son skips police summons  UP Police on Friday issued a fresh notice to Union MoS Ajay Mishra’s son, asking him to appear before it by 11 am on Saturday in Lakhimpur Kheri violence case, after he missed the Friday deadline.Khattar retracts ‘tit for tat’ remarkFacing criticism, Haryana CM ML Khattar retracted his controversial “tit for tat’’ remark, saying he had no malicious intent. “I want to tell my farmer brothers...

The state has not made such a request. Please have this on reopening (after Dussehra). If you are not satisfied with progress... hand it over to the CBI.”However, the top court wasn't very receptive to the idea of handing over the probe to the CBI."Mr Salve, we have respect for you. We hope the state will take necessary steps due to the sensitivity of the issue. We are not making any comments. The CBI is not a solution for reasons known to you…because of the persons....better some other persons look into it," the CJI said.Earlier, Salve told the Bench that the post-mortem report did not show any bullet wounds and that's why Section 160 of the CrPC notice was sent."But the manner in which the car was driven, if the allegations are true, there is a 302 (murder) case," Salve said.The CJI said, "This is the opinion of the bench…this is a responsible state government and police... when there's a serious allegation of death or gunshot injury…will the accused in this country be treated the same way?As Salve said the post-mortem did not show gunshot injury, the Bench shot back, "So this is a ground for not taking custody of the accused.""They have found two cartridges, maybe he had a bad aim and he missed it," Salve responded.The Bench took strong exception to certain reports by a TV news channel which allegedly said the CJI had met a victim's family."We are sorry to see how the media is exceeding freedom of speech and expression. The CJI is gracious enough to let this go, else proceedings could take place," Justice Surya Kant said."We all have been victim of such tweets.... It's so absurd. This deserves to be treated with contempt," Salve commented."It's so absurd...I am in the court here... how can I go to Lucknow?" the CJI wondered.Justice Kohli said, "We respect freedom of the media but this is not the way to cross the limit."Acting on a letter written by advocates Shiv Kumar Tripathi and CS Panda, the top court had on Thursday ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to file a status report in 24 hours on action taken by it, including arrest of accused named in FIRs for murder, with regard to Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people, including four farmers, were killed on Sunday.Terming the incident as “extremely unfortunate” it had also asked the state government to provide immediate medical treatment to the mother of deceased Lovepreet Singh who was in a critical condition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-kheri-violence%C2%A0dissatisfied-with-up-police-probe-sc-hints-at-giving-it-to-an-agency-other-than-cbi-321874

My son is innocent. He got a notice on Thursday but he said he was not well. He will appear before the police tomorrow and give his statement and evidence as he is innocent.”            He was talking to reporters outside Chowdhary Charan Singh airport in Lucknow.On Opposition relentless attack on him and demand for his resignation, the minister said, “Vipaksh to kuch bhi mangta hai (Opposition can demand anything).”     “This is a BJP government which works in an unbiased manner. Action will be taken against those found guilty,” he said.As Ashish did not show up, reports emerged that he may have fled to Nepal.Asked about it, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Friday said, “If this is true, the Centre should intervene and get the accused arrested from Nepal.”                 In a statement issued here, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha said, “...there is no trace of him (Ashish Mishra). News reports indicate that he is changing locations and is absconding, with several Uttar Pradesh Police teams searching for him.”      The morcha expressed its “serious concern and shock” at Mishra not yet being arrested.After two men were arrested on Thursday, the police pasted a notice outside Ajay Mishra’s house asking Ashish to appear before it at 10 am on Friday.The arrested men were identified as Luvkush of Banbirpur village and Ashish Pandey of Nighasan tehsil, two of the seven people mentioned in an FIR lodged by the police in connection with the violence.A nine-member team headed by DIG Upendra Agarwal has been formed to investigate the FIR lodged against the minister’s son and others.Four of the eight people who died on Sunday were farmers, allegedly knocked down by vehicles carrying BJP workers. Angry farmers then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles.The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver.Farmers claimed that Ashish Mishra was in one of the vehicles, an allegation denied by him and his father who say they can produce evidence to prove he was at an event at that time.In its statement, the morcha alleged that two other men—Sumit Jaiswal and Ankit Das—were also involved in the violence, but they are not being arrested by the police.“There is only information on a notice issued to Ashish Mishra summoning him for questioning. The UP government and Minister Ajay Kumar Mishra are adopting protective tactics to ensure that Ashish Mishra roams free,” it said.It alleged that Sumit Jaiswal was in the Thar vehicle that mowed down the farmers and was clearly seen escaping from the vehicle.Similarly, a video clip where a police official was seen questioning a person caught during the incident revealed that Ankit Das was in the Fortuner vehicle that was also involved in the violence, the morcha said.The morcha demanded immediate arrest of Ashish, Sumit and Ankit.The minister’s son is named in the FIR in the Lakhimpur violence.
