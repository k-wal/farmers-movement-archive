06-10-2021||New Delhi||Lakhimpur Kheri incident: Why is there so much hatred against farmers, Kejriwal asks PM||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday lashed out at the Centre over the death of farmers during violence in Lakhimpur Kheri and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure justice for the families of the victims.The AAP leader also demanded that the accused in the case be arrested and that Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Kumar Mishra, whose son has been named as accused in the incident, be sacked.Addressing a virtual press conference, he alleged that the “entire system” is trying to protect the killers of the farmers and asked the prime minister why nobody has been arrested so far in connection with the case.“For the last one year, farmers have been sitting on a dharna. More than 600 farmers have died so far. And then farmers are crushed and killed by mowing them down under wheels. Why is there so much hatred against the farmers,” he questioned the prime minister.The chief minister also asked Modi why Mishra has not yet been dismissed as Union minister of state for home affairs.“Every citizen of this country is today demanding justice for the farmers. The decision is in your hands,” Kejriwal said appealing to the prime minister to intervene in the matter and also visit family members of the accused.The entire nation wants that those accused of killing farmers be immediately arrested and Mishra be sacked from his ministerial post, he said.Kejriwal attacked the Uttar Pradesh government for allegedly not allowing opposition party leaders to meet the family members of the victims.“Pradhan mantri (prime minister) ji, on the one hand, the government is celebrating ‘Azadi Ka Mahotsav (festival of freedom)’ and on the other hand, opposition leaders are being arrested on their way to Lakhimpur. What type of freedom is this? The British used to take such actions,” he said.After initially denying permission to the leaders of political parties to reach Lakhimpur Kheri, meanwhile, the UP government allowed them to visit the district.AAP MP Sanjay Singh, who was under detention at Biswan in Sitapur since the early hours of Monday, travelled to Lakhimpur Kheri and met the family members of the farmers killed in the violence. Other AAP leaders, including Raghav Chadda and Harpal Singh, joined Singh there.During the visit of the AAP delegation, Kejriwal spoke to a family member of one of the farmers, who was killed in violence, over phone, and expressed his condolences and solidarity.“The entire nation is standing by you. All of us together will ensure that your family gets justice. You need not feel alone,” the Delhi chief minister said while speaking to a relative of the farmer killed in the violence.Four of the eight dead in Sunday’s violence in Lakhimpur Kheri were farmers, allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to an event in the area.The others, including BJP workers and their driver, were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and lynched by the protesters.The Uttar Pradesh Police has lodged a case against Mishra’s son, Ashish, but no arrest has been made so far. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-kheri-incident-why-is-there-so-much-hatred-against-farmers-kejriwal-asks-pm-321043

06-10-2021||New Delhi||Unable to bring SCs, STs at same level of merit as forward classes in 75 years: Centre to top court||It is a “fact of life” that even after around 75 years those belonging to SC and ST have not been brought to the same level of merit as the forward classes, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.Attorney General K K Venugopal told a bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao that it is “more difficult” for those belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) to get a higher post in group A category of jobs and time has come when the apex court should give some “concrete basis” for SC, ST and Other Backward Class (OBCs) to fill up vacancies.The top court, which was hearing arguments on the issue relating to reservation in promotions to the employees belonging to SC and ST, said it finds from the data that representation is low in group A jobs and it is “not fair” that instead of improving it, adequate representation is being ensured in group B and C categories.“We are finding that in group A, the representation is low. Therefore, by accommodating, instead of improving the representation in group A, you are ensuring that there is adequate representation in group B and C. This is not fair. This is the argument of the government,” observed the bench, also comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and B R Gavai.The observation by the bench came after Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Balbir Singh, appearing for the Centre, referred to the data.During the hearing, Venugopal said that in group A and B jobs, there is under representation while in group C and D, there is over representation.“That is a fact of life because we are not being able, after 75 years, to bring the SCs and STs to the same level of merit as the forward classes,” he said, adding, “It is more difficult for the SCs and STs to get the higher post which is in A and B.”He said in category A, they have to go to a higher level on their own merit and therefore, efficiency is looked into and backwardness is not relevant there.“Time has come for your lordships to give concrete basis for the SC, ST and OBC to fill up vacancies,” he said.The bench made clear that it is not dealing with the issue of OBCs and the issue relates to reservation in promotion to SCs and STs.The Attorney General said that as per the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), there are about 5,000 cadres in the central government and 53 departments.Venugopal said they would file an affidavit in the matter.ASG Singh told the bench that data from 1965-2017 has been given in case of groups A, B, C and D which indicates that in group A and B there is shortage and possibly in group C and certainly in D, there is over reservation.“There cannot be over reservation at all,” the bench observed, adding this is the data pertaining to initial joining posts as well as the promotional posts.Singh also referred to data of 19 ministries as on January 1 this year.“From the data that you have given, there are certain classes where the figures are more than what is prescribed. So, if you solely go by this, then there is an imperative need for discontinuing reservation in those classes. Is it not?” observed the bench, which would continue hearing arguments in the matter on Thursday.The apex court had on Tuesday asked the Centre as to what exercise it has undertaken to justify decisions to grant quota in promotions to the employees belonging to the SC and ST on counts such as they have inadequate representation in jobs and the reservation will not adversely impact the overall administrative efficiency.Venugopal had referred to the apex court judgements right from the Indra Sawhney verdict of 1992, popularly known as Mandal Commission case to the Jarnail Singh verdict of 2018.The Mandal judgement had ruled out quota in promotions.The law officer had said that till 1975, 3.5 per cent SCs and 0.62 per cent of STs were in government employment and this is the average figure.Now in 2008, the figure of SCs and STs in government employment has come to 17.5 and 6.8 per cent respectively which are still low and justify such quota, he had said.The top court had on September 14 said it would not reopen its decision on granting reservation in promotions to the SCs and STs as it was for the states to decide how they implement it.Earlier, Maharashtra and other states had said the promotions have been made in unreserved categories, but promotions have not been granted in reserved categories for SC and ST employees.In 2018, a five-judge Constitution bench had refused to refer the 2006 judgement in the M Nagraj case, in which the creamy layer concept was extended to the SCs and STs to a larger seven-judge bench for reconsideration.It had also paved the way for a grant of quota for promotions in the government jobs to SCs and STs and had modified the 2006 judgement to the extent that the states will not be required to “collect quantifiable data” reflecting the backwardness among these communities to justify the quota in promotions.However, the top court in 2018 had upheld the other conditions such as the governments will have to justify promotions in quota for SCs and STs by establishing that their representation in that particular kind of job is inadequate and this would not impact the overall administrative efficiency.

06-10-2021||New Delhi||Lakhimpur violence row: Does focus on Priyanka, Rahul draw away attention from BJP’s chief rival in UP—Akhilesh?||Has the political slugfest with the Congress following the Lakhimpur Kheri incident helped the ruling BJP shift focus from Adityanath government’s chief rival in Uttar Pradesh—the Samajwadi Party?A section of Samajwadi supporters believes that Congress leaders Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are being given “undue attention by the UP government” to divert attention from the “BJP’s real rival” in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh—Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav.While Yadav’s detractors scoff at the observation, pointing to his “missing in action” status and “complacent attitude so far to the political happenings around him”, his supporters call the “build-up around Priyanka and Rahul” a “deliberate attempt by the BJP”.“Otherwise, how is it possible that Priyanka Gandhi was arrested/detained for days for trying to reach Lakhimpur Kheri whereas Akhilesh Yadav, who too could have been given the same treatment, was simply let off? Everyone knows that Akhilesh has a larger cadre base than Congress. In politics, building a weak contender who is otherwise a lesser threat is also a way to counter a strong rival,” claims a political analyst associated with the Samajwadi Party.Though many also believe that Yadav himself is responsible “by not reacting to the situation in a politically appropriate manner,” propagators of the theory question wonder if that were true, how was a delegation of the Trinamool Congress able to meet families of farmers killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence despite prohibitory orders.Claiming they dodged Uttar Pradesh police by posing as tourists, TMC leaders met the families of the victims---the only opposition delegation that managed to travel all the way to the violence-hit area amid prohibitory orders.Meanwhile, all eyes are on Yadav’s ‘Samajwadi Vijay Yatra’, which supporters believe has proved to be “lucky for the party” in the past as well.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-violence-row-does-focus-on-priyanka-rahul-draw-away-attention-from-bjps-chief-rival-in-up%E2%80%94akhilesh-321025
06-10-2021||New Delhi||Cabinet approves bonus equal to 78 days’ wage for over 11 lakh railway employees||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a productivity-linked bonus equivalent to 78 days’ wage to eligible non-gazetted Railway employees, Union minister Anurag Thakur said.The bonus for the financial year 2020-21 will benefit about 11.56 lakh non-gazetted Railway employees, he said.An expenditure of nearly Rs 1,985 crore will be incurred on this.The bonus is usually announced ahead of Dussehra and Puja festivities.The wage calculation ceiling prescribed for payment of PLB to the eligible non-gazetted railway employees is Rs 7,000 per month.The maximum amount payable per eligible railway employee is Rs 17,951 for 78 days.About 11.56 lakh non-gazetted Railway employees are likely to benefit from the decision.Railway Board Chairman and COO Suneet Sharma, later at a press conference, said the bonus will be disbursed as usual before Dussehra.He said the payment of these bonuses, especially after a tough year that saw railwaymen battling against coronavirus and still reporting for duty, would encourage them to work harder.“Many rail employees reported to work despite the fear for their personal welfare. They were frontline workers. This payment of bonus will encourage them to work harder,” said Sharma.The Productivity Linked Bonus on Railway covers all non-gazetted railway employees (excluding RPF/RPSF personnel) who are spread over the entire country.Last year, the Indian Railways had disbursed a bonus worth 78 days’ wages to its 11.58 lakh non-gazetted employees after Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Union Cabinet had approved disbursal of productivity and non-productivity-linked bonus for 2019-2020 to more than 30 lakh central government employees.

06-10-2021||Lakhimpur Kheri (UP)||Lakhimpur Kheri violence hits local Sikh community hard||The spot near Tikonia village where violence erupted on Sunday during a farmers’ protest is amid an area linked to the life of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder of Sikhism.Granthi Baljeet Singh from Kaudiyawala Ghat Gurdwara says the Guru came here in 1554 and cured a person of “kodh”, or leprosy. The shrine gets its name from there.The devout believe that a dip in the ‘sarovar’ of the gurdwara, located close to the spot where eight people were killed, can cure people of skin diseases.Lakhimpur Kheri district and the adjoining areas in the Terai have been home to Sikh farmers for generations – including those who came during the time of the Awadh nawabs, migrants from undivided Punjab and the more recent settlers.On Sunday, Sikh farmers formed a sizeable number of those protesting over the visit of Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. And all the four dead farmers had Punjabi names.They were allegedly mowed down by a vehicle carrying BJP workers. The other four victims included two BJP workers, allegedly lynched by angry protesters.Many farmers from Lakhimpur Kheri and the neighbouring areas in the Terai have been actively involved in the protests against the agri-marketing laws enacted at the Centre last year.Many have made trips to the protest sites on Delhi’s borders – dominated by farmers from Punjab and Haryana—where the agitation has been on for months now. They also attended the Kisan Mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar last month.Bahraich, Shahjahanpur and Pilibhit are among the other Uttar Pradesh districts with a significant population of Sikh farmers.Largest in area among the 75 UP districts, Lakhimpur Kheri is known for sugarcane cultivation, and there are nine sugar mills in the district.Sarjit Singh, a retired sports teacher at a government school in Bahraich, says Sikh farmers from Punjab started buying forestland in the Terai districts because the same amount of money would get them bigger pieces of land than back home.“Some sold their five bighas of land in Punjab and bought 25 bigha in Bahraich near the forests,” he says.But there have been settlers earlier as well.Balwant Singh Ramoowalia, who has been a minister in UP and at the Centre, said Sikhs came to Lakhimpur Kheri from undivided Punjab in the 1940s.Earlier, the nawabs of Awadh encouraged members of the community to settle in the area, and many bought land, he tells PTI.“The first chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Govind Ballabh Pant, too had encouraged Sikhs to buy land in this area,” says Ramoowalia, now a member of the UP legislative council from Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party.According to an elderly Pyara Singh, there are three or four lakh Sikhs in Lakhimpur Kheri. Most farmers from the community are based in Palia, Nighasan and Gola tehsils in the district.In Bahraich district, Nihinaurwa, Mihipurwa and Bichiiya areas have a significant concentration of Sikhs in Bahraich district.Of the four farmers killed on Sunday, Lovepreet Singh and Nachatar Singh hailed from Lakhimpur Kheri. Gurvinder Singh and Daljeet Singh were from Bahraich.The community is represented in the Yogi Adityanath cabinet by Baldev Singh Aulakh. Ramoowalia was a minister during the SP term.Lakhimpur farmers say they were angry with Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Kumar Mishra over a “provocative” speech he made after being shown black flags during his public meeting in his Kheri Lok Sabha constituency.He said he could discipline such people in “two minutes”, the farmers say. Ashish Mishra, the minister’s son, is named in an FIR registered over the farmers’ deaths.But he claims he was nowhere near the trouble spot when the violence took place.

06-10-2021||Bengaluru||RSS ‘infiltrating’ all sectors, alleges Mallikarjun Kharge||The Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, on Wednesday said the RSS was “infiltrating” all sectors, including education, and his long fight against the organisation cost him his Lok Sabha seat during the 2019 parliamentary polls.“They (RSS) are infiltrating everywhere, including education. Many officers are directly recruited, amending the rule and that much (people) are deprived of reservation ...,” Kharge said in response to a question.Speaking to reporters here, he said he has been fighting the RSS and its ideology from the age of 15-16, and it is one of the reasons for his loss in 2019 Lok Sabha election from Gulbarga seat.“We are fighting against the RSS, we don’t want to hide it. We will fight and that’s why I lost my election also. The RSS is not pro-poor, it is not for social justice. They believe in ‘Manusmiti’, read Golwalkar Guruji the second Sarsanghchalak of RSS,” he said.The senior Congress leader was responding to a question on JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy’s statement referring to a book that RSS as part of its hidden agenda, has created a team of bureaucrats in this country, who are now placed in various institutions.“In that book, it is said that about 4,000 civil servants in this country- IAS, IPS officers- are RSS karyakartas. They are trained to write exams. In one year, in 2016 alone, 676 people trained by them got selected,” the former CM had claimed on Tuesday.On the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, Kharge demanded a probe by a sitting Supreme Court judge to bring the facts out, and immediate release of opposition leaders who have been illegally detained.Four of the eight dead in Sunday’s violence in Lakhimpur Kheri were farmers, allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to an event in the area.The others including BJP workers and their driver were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and lynched by the protesters.The Uttar Pradesh Police has lodged a case against Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish, but no arrest has been made so far.Kharge sought to know why Ashish has not been arrested so far and why the Congress leaders were not being allowed to meet the victims’ family.He demanded Ajay Mishra’s immediate dismissal from the union cabinet.The veteran also accused Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra of ‘instigating’ people against protesting farmers, and demanded that they should be booked for sedition.Condemning the detention of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra at Sitapur while on her way to Lakhimpur Kheri to meet the family of victims, the Congress leader termed it as “illegal detention” and “crime”. He stated that she was detained without any warrant or FIR, just on the basis oral instructions.The place where Priyanka Gandhi has been detained has not even been declared as jail or sub-jail, he said. “Is this dictatorship? is there democratic values? Fear psychosis is being created and it is detrimental for the country,” he added. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-infiltrating-all-sectors-alleges-mallikarjun-kharge-320996
06-10-2021||Ravi S Singh||Modi distributes property cards; pitches for harnessing of drones||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 6Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday virtually distributed e-property cards to 1,71,000 beneficiaries of 3,000 villages in Madhya Pradesh under the Svamitva scheme, saying the scheme would lead to growth of rural India.He said the mantra of rapid and integrated development of villages and their modernisation could be possible by harnessing technology.To this effect, he said drones are a vital cog in the wheel, and urged start-ups and other entrepreneurs to produce best-quality drones at competitive prices in India. The Union government has started the PLI scheme to facilitate this."Drones will be the next thing for surveys, mapping and demarcation of land and properties, service delivery," Modi said.Svamitva, a Central scheme, entails survey of village population and mapping with improvised technology and aims to provide property rights to residents in rural areas.This is being done through help of drones. The surveys of villages and properties have been accomplished in 60 districts across the country.Modi said the Swamitva scheme, which is implemented by the Panchayati Raj Ministry, will usher in a new dawn of development in villages and empowerment of the residents.The property card, which is an official certification of ownership of property, will be a financial asset to villagers to procure bank loans and other financial benefits, like in urban areas.Villagers, including poor sections and small farmers, will not have to borrow money from individuals."The scheme will help them to become atmarnirbhar...through the villages the country will emerge stronger," Modi said.He said the scheme was launched as a pilot project in selected villages in parts of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. About 22 lakh property cards have been processed and made ready for distribution.Now the scheme is being implemented across the country.He said the scheme would help small farmers, who form a majority in the farming community, saying they had been neglected by policymakers for decades.Modi said his government’s thrust is to empower the viilagers and poorer sections of society through various schemes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-distributes-property-cards-pitches-for-harnessing-of-drones-320990
06-10-2021||New Delhi||India hosted youngest populations of ‘Acheulean’ human ancestors: Study||Populations of ancient humans using Acheulean stone toolkits persisted in India until about 1,77,000 years ago, shortly before the earliest expansions of our own species, Homo sapiens, across Asia, according to a study published on Wednesday.The longest lasting tool-making tradition in prehistory, known as the Acheulean, was characterised by distinctive oval and pear-shaped stone handaxes and cleavers associated with Homo erectus and derived species such as Homo heidelbergensis.Latest research led by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany re-examined a key Acheulean site at the margins of the monsoon zone in the Thar Desert, Rajasthan.The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, shows the presence of Acheulean populations until about 1,77,000 years ago, shortly before the earliest expansions of Homo sapiens across Asia.The timing and route of the earliest expansions of our own species across Asia have been the focus of considerable debate.However, a growing body of evidence indicates Homo sapiens interacted with numerous populations of our closest evolutionary cousins, the researchers said.Identifying where these different populations met is critical to revealing the human and cultural landscape encountered by the earliest members of our species to expand beyond Africa, they said.The researchers noted that although fossils of ancient human populations are extremely rare in South Asia, changes in the stone tool kits they made, used, and left behind can help resolve when and where these encounters may have occurred.The latest research reports the relatively recent occupation of the site of Singi Talav by Acheulean populations up to 1,77,000 years ago.The site was once thought to be amongst the oldest Acheulean sites in India, but now appears to be one of the youngest, according to the researchers.These dates show the persistence of Acheulean populations in the Thar Desert after their disappearance in eastern Africa around 2,14,000 years ago and Arabia 1,90,000 years ago, they noted.The study illuminates the environmental conditions that allowed Acheulean populations to thrive at the margins of the monsoon in the Thar Desert until at least 1,77,000 years ago.“This supports evidence from across the region indicating that India hosted the youngest populations using Acheulean toolkits across the world,” said Jimbob Blinkhorn of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, the lead author of the study.“Critically, the late persistence of the Acheulean at Singi Talav and elsewhere in India directly precedes evidence for the appearance of our own species, Homo sapiens, as they expanded across Asia,” Blinkhorn added.The researchers noted that the site of Singi Talav, set on a lakeside close to the modern town of Didwana at the edge of the Thar Desert, was first excavated in the early 1980’s, revealing multiple stone tool assemblages.The largest assemblage shows a focus on the production of stone handaxes and cleavers that are typical of the Acheulean, they said.However, the techniques needed to accurately date these assemblages were not available at the time of their discovery.“The lakeside setting has ideal preservation conditions for an archaeological site, enabling us to return 30 years after the first excavation and readily re-identify the main occupation horizons again,” said Blinkhorn.The researchers used luminescence methods to directly date the sediment horizons occupied by ancient human populations.These methods rely on the ability of minerals like quartz and feldspar to store and release energy induced by natural radioactivity, allowing scientists to determine the last time sediments were exposed to light.“Ours is the first study to directly date the occupation horizons at Singi Talav, enabling us to understand both when ancient humans lived here and created the stone tool assemblages, and how these occupations compare with other sites across the region,” said Julie Durcan of the University of Oxford in the UK.The Thar Desert sits at the western edge of the modern Indian summer monsoon system, and its habitability to ancient human populations likely fluctuated significantly.The researchers examined plant microfossils, known as phytoliths, as well as features of soil geochemistry to reveal the ecology of the site at the time the Acheulean toolkits were produced.“This is the first time the ecology of an Acheulean site in India has been studied using these methods, revealing the broader character of the landscape that these populations inhabited,” said Professor Hema Achyuthan of Anna University, Chennai, who also participated in the excavations at the site.“The results from the two methods we applied complement each other to reveal a landscape rich in the types of grasses that flourish during periods with enhanced summer monsoons,” Achyuthan added.

The fourth farmer, Gurvinder Singh, was cremated on Wednesday after a second autopsy was conducted on his body.Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra also met Home Minister Amit Shah in the North Block triggering questions on whether the government would take action against him as he has been named in one of the FIRs for political conspiracy in the Sunday violence.Mishra’s son Ashish has been booked for murder with the opposition and farmer leaders demanding the arrest of Ashish and the sacking of his father.Modi, meanwhile, is learnt to have received a detailed report on the incident. A dossier has also been sent to home ministry for review.Back in UP, DGP Law and Order Prashant Kumar said a decision had been taken to allow people to visit Lakhimpur Kheri in groups of five. This means the Congress delegation led by Rahul Gandhi, and AAP leader Sanjay Singh and others can now meet victims’ families.Kumar said the police would probe every video uploaded on social media with respect to the Sunday violence.“We appeal to people not to provoke the situation. All videos will be probed and action taken against the fake ones,” said Kumar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-allows-politicians-to-visit-lakhimpur-kheri-in-groups-of-5-320975

They had received support from farmer leader Rakesh Tikait and Punjabi singer Sonia Mann.With the Uttar Pradesh government agreeing to their demand, a second post-mortem was conducted on Tuesday night by a team of experts from Lucknow, Superintendent of Police Sujata Singh said.Hours after this, Gurvinder Singh was cremated by his family at his village in the presence of Tikait, ADG (Gorakhpur) Akhil Kumar and senior police and administration officials, Additional Superintendent of Police (Rural) Ashok Kumar said.The post-mortem report would be prepared under the supervision of the experts who conducted the examination, SP Singh said.District Magistrate Dinesh Chandra Singh said the family of Gurvinder had raised objections on the post-mortem done earlier."With the permission of the state government, it was done again and videographed as well," he added.Talking to PTI, Sukhdev Singh, uncle of Gurvinder, said, "Post-mortem was done in front of us and our leaders. At that time doctors told us that Gurvinder was not shot.""When in both post-mortems, doctors say that he was not shot, we had no option but to cremate him," he added.The mortal remains of the three other farmers were cremated at their native places on Tuesday.The UP government is facing a massive flak after eight people were killed in violence during a protest against the farm laws in Lakhimpur on Sunday.

I am shocked beyond belief, how Priyanka has been arrested under Section 151 of the Indian Penal Code," he said in the post.Vadra said he spoke with Priyanka Gandhi on Tuesday and was informed that she had not been served with any order or notice. She had not been produced before a judicial officer and had not been allowed to meet her legal counsel, he said."I am really worried for her and I had packed my bag to go to Lucknow now, when I was informed that I won't be allowed to step out of the airport. This is totally shocking that as a husband I can't even go and support my wife," Vadra said."Thankfully, she has a huge support of the masses. But for me, my family and my wife comes first. I really hope and pray that she is released soon and is back home safe," he added.Uttar Pradesh Police on Wednesday also denied permission to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to visit Lakhimpur Kheri.Prohibitory orders have been imposed in Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight people, including four farmers, were killed in Sunday's violence during a protest, and in Sitapur, where Priyanka has been in detention since Monday.

06-10-2021||Vibha Sharma||Rahul Gandhi does not want situation to normalise as he wants to save his own family: BJP||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 6Slamming the Congress, the BJP on Wednesday accused the opposition party of indulging in “negative politics” to create further “unrest and riots” in an already sensitive zone and trying to “get political mileage out of a tragic situation”.“He and his family have nothing to do with the people, farmers or even the Congress. Their own leaders are making accusations against them so now they (Gandhis) are trying to save themselves. Lakhimpur Kheri is just a political opportunity to safeguard their political future. The family is trying to drive political mileage out of a tragic situation,” said BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra.The ruling party also charged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi with trying to “provoke people in order to save the family”.“They do not want the situation to normalise for narrow political gains. They are not interested in farmers or their issues; they just want a photo-op and create unrest in a sensitive zone,” UP minister Sidharth Nath Singh said accusing opposition leaders of indulging in “political tourism”.In Delhi, Patra said that at a time when a probe is going on, no irresponsible statements should be given. “However, irresponsibility has become second nature with Rahul Gandhi. His main aim is to provoke and create violence whereas we (BJP) are trying to maintain peace,” he said.“Today, in his press conference, Rahul Gandhi raised questions on the post-mortem of victims. Is he a forensic expert, a medical doctor who can question the conclusion of professions,” Patra said, also accusing Gandhi of creating “doubts in the minds of people” and “provoking them when he should be helping calm the situation”.   Responding to Gandhi’s accusation of “lack of democracy” in the country, Patra retailaited saying: “Have any BJP workers thrown tomatoes at your press conference or your house like they had at the house of (Congress leader) Kapil Sibal? There is democracy in the country that is why you manage to abuse the Prime Minister every now and then.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-does-not-want-situation-to-normalise-as-he-wants-to-save-his-own-family-bjp-320968

Action will be taken, whether the accused is ‘raja’ or ‘rank’. It’s a very sad incident and law will take its course.”Attacking the opposition, Singh said, “Their conduct is negative on this sensitive issue. They have got another chance to play politics from home and on Twitter. They just want photo-ops, and upload images on social media.”Also read: ‘Rush, I’m dying’: Victim Lovepreet Singh’s last words haunt fatherSingh said the state government had acted in the interest of law and order to deny permission to Gandhis to visit Lakhimpur Kheri.“You can go sometime later to meet the families but you won’t be allowed to disturb peace. This is all happening under law. Today, suddenly one more ‘yuvraj’ of the Congress woke up energetic saying my sister is already there but where am I. So he said ‘main bhi hun na’ and has embarked on an excursion to Lakhimpur,” the UP minister said moments after Gandhi called India a dictatorship.The BJP leader said Gandhi had forgotten who imposed the Emergency and how after the death of Indira Gandhi Sikhs were massacred.“The BJP stood by the Sikhs then to protect them. You better watch the plight of farmers in Rajasthan and Punjab,” Singh told Gandhi.The minister also took a swipe at Gandhi for saying that he was going to Lakhimpur to determine ground reality.“If you don’t know what happened why are you and your sister jumping to conclusions. Why pass judgments? Sometimes sweeping floor, sometime citing drones. Everyone uses drones in 21st century India. You are still in the 20th century,” Singh added.He rejected Gandhi’s charge about post-mortems saying all families except one had accepted the reports.“One family was not satisfied. The state government formed a panel of doctors to conduct a second autopsy which is under way. The state is acting transparently to reach to the bottom of the truth,” Singh said.He questioned Gandhis over their anxiety, saying a senior farmer union leader had helped build peace and consensus in Lakhimpur.“But you are habitual of making videos and speaking unreasonably. The Yogi government is committed to tracking down perpetrators of the Sunday violence and bringing them to justice,” the state minister added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-a-political-tourist-saying-main-bhi-hun-naa-says-up-minister-320959

We were a democracy once.Today, there is a dictatorship in India. Politicians can’t go to UP. A CM goes and is stopped citing Section 144 of the CrPC. Why this dictatorship? Because theft is going on. Small businesses, farmers are being looted, petrol and diesel prices are rising. India’s voice is being crushed.”Gandhi said he would try to visit Lakhimpur and had sought permission.“What happened in UP had happened in Hathras also. Criminals can do anything under this rule. Perpetrators who kill are free and those who are attacked go to jail,” said Gandhi not dwelling too much on Priyanka’s arrest and noting “this is about the farmers, not about us”.The Congress leader said he wanted to go there and support the families of the deceased.“We are being stopped. Other parties have been allowed. What wrong have we done? The Opposition’s job is to mount pressure. When we exert pressure, action follows. The government wants that we should not exert pressure, so that criminals can escape. We won’t allow that,” he said, noting that the current narrative that all dissenters are anti-nationals has a time span.“It’s a narrative being built using institutions, the police and structures, but there’s a limit to this narrative. Sooner than later, there will be an explosion. We are telling the government to let democracy work and not shut this safety valve, otherwise other problems will erupt. We are pushing for democratic process to be maintained. We are going to the farmers to give them confidence that they can’t be run over by a minister’s son. We are going to give a message of hope,” Gandhi said, adding that no one knew the ground reality about Lakhimpur and the Congress wanted to determine that through its visit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dictatorship-in-india-farmers-being-systematically-attacked-rahul-gandhi-320949

The values of democracy, liberty, freedom, non-violence, and rule of law, that we cherish and nourish, form the strong foundation on which the edifice of India-US relations is built,” Sandhu said in his address to the students of private, federally chartered historically black research university.Even before India gained independence, many of the leading lights of its freedom struggle, including Lala Lajpat Rai, Sarojini Naidu, Rabindranath Tagore, BR Ambedkar among others, had visited several universities in the US, including Howard, Sandhu said.“We shared and shaped each other's vision. You and I owe our allegiance to our respective constitutions, which both start with, ‘We the People...' he said.Dr Martin Luther King Jr had delivered the ‘'Gandhi Memorial Lecture’ at Howard University in 1963 and 1966. Dr William Stuart Nelson, dean of the School of Religion and vice president for special projects at Howard University, established Gandhi Memorial Lecture in 1958.He was an exponent of the philosophy of nonviolence, who had been a friend of both Mahatma Gandhi and Dr Martin Luther King Jr. He had walked with both in protest marches.In his address, Sandhu noted that the story of Howard was closely tied to America's history; recalled how leaders from India and the US influenced the thoughts of each other and the impact it had in shaping the history of both countries.The Ambassador also highlighted the concept of trusteeship, principle of non-violence, devotion to truth and journeys as key aspects of Gandhi's work. In his address Sandhu underlined how Gandhi's principles have shaped India's vision for development and prosperity.

In Ayodhya, there is a plan to light 7.5 lakh diyas. It will make Lord Ram happy,” he said.The death of farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri found no mention in the Prime Minister’s 35-minute speech.Adityanath, who also spoke at the event, didn’t mention the Lakhimpur Kheri incident either.Opinions page: Lakhimpur Kheri outrage shifts political discourse||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-lucknow-modi-targets-sp-for-obstructing-housing-project-320717

Would the heavens have fallen if it was done from next year? What would happen if a year’s time is given to students to prepare. Changing the pattern is in the domain of experts but do it in a way experts should do, not in this fashion,” the Bench commented as it wondered why the present pattern couldn’t be allowed to continue for this year.The Bench, which had on September 20 issued notice to the Centre, National Board of Examination and National Medical Commission on the petition challenging alleged last minute changes in the syllabus for the NEET PG Super Speciality Exam 2021 scheduled in November, said grave prejudice will be caused to students if it was enforced from this year.“Have some concern for the students. What is the hurry? You have an exam pattern, which has held field since 2018, so why change now,” the Bench asked and posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday.1.83L appeals pending in Allahabad HCThe SC on Tuesday said it would lay down guidelines to deal with the pendency of criminal appeals in the Allahabad HC, where 7,214 convicts languishing in jails for more than 10 years are awaiting adjudication of their appeals.

Parisi is rewarded for his revolutionary contributions to the theory of disordered materials and random processes,” the Swedish Academy of Sciences said in a statement.“Hasselmann, who is at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, said he did not want to wake up from what he described as a beautiful dream. I am retired and a bit lazy lately,” he added.

He said the S-400 air defence system to be imported from Russia would be inducted this year.The missiles can target and bring down multiple air-borne threats. Addressing a press conference here ahead of Air Force Day (October 8), the IAF Chief, who took over on September 30, said there was a plan to meet new demand as old fighter jets were phased out. On being asked about a timeline on meeting the need for the mandated 42 squadrons, he said, “We will not be able to do so in the next 10-15 years.”The IAF plans to phase out over 100 Jaguar jets, approximately 50 Mirage jets and about 60 MiG-29 fighter planes.As the deliveries of 36 Rafale fighter jets will be completed by next year, the IAF now is looking to take up the case of 114 fighter jets. The responses to the ‘Request for Information’ have been received from manufacturers. “We are moving the case further,” the IAF Chief said.“In this project, we are looking to integrate fifth and sixth generation technologies,” the IAF Chief said, adding that it would be a ‘Make in India’ model and the Defence Acquisition Council would decide on it.Apart from the 114 jets to be made in India by a foreign maker, the IAF Chief said deliveries of 83 Mark 1A Tejas jets made by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited would start in 2024. On being asked about the new air bases of China, the IAF Chief said the infrastructure developments on Chinese side do not impact IAF operations.Also read: ‘No two-finger test done in rape case’42-squadron target still farIAF is unlikely to meet its target of 42 squadrons over the next 10-15 years.

It also gave liberty to Jafri to file additional compilation in the matter.Zakia had filed a petition in the apex court in 2018 challenging the Gujarat High Court’s October 5, 2017 order rejecting her plea against the decision of the Special Investigation Team (SIT). Ehsan Jafri was among the 68 people killed at Gulberg Society on February 28, 2002, a day after the S-6 Coach of the Sabarmati Express was burnt at Godhra killing 59 people and triggering riots in Gujarat.On February 8, 2012, the SIT filed a closure report giving a clean chit to the then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and 63 others, including senior government officials, saying there was “no prosecutable evidence” against them.On Tuesday, Sibal said the matter has suddenly come up and there were about 23,000 pages of record and they would circulate a convenience compilation.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the request on the ground of convenience compilation is being raised for the last one-and-a-half-year.“Mr Sibal, we think that Mr Solicitor General was very considerate in saying only one-and-a-half year. The matter is pending from 2018,” the Bench said.Earlier, the Bench had deferred hearing on Jafri’s plea in April and March this year as well at her instance and the Bench had said it won’t entertain any more request for adjournment.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for the SIT, had opposed the adjournment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/clean-chit-to-modi-in-2002-gujarat-riots-sc-defers-hearing-on-zakia-jafris-plea-yet-again-320559
06-10-2021||Lakhimpur Kheri/Bahraich (UP)||Family of one of farmers killed in Lakhimpur seeks second autopsy; mortal remains of 3 others cremated||The mortal remains of three of the farmers, who were mowed down by a vehicle during a protest in Lakhimpur Kheri, were cremated at their native places on Tuesday, while the family of the fourth one demanded a second post-mortem.Bahraich Additional Superintendent of Police (Rural) Ashok Kumar said that “a decision on the demand for a second post mortem could be taken only by senior officials”.Among the farmers killed in the Sunday incident, two each were from Lakhimpur Kheri and Bahraich and the bodies were handed over to their families after a post mortem on Monday.The families of Lavpreet Singh (19), Nachattar Singh (65) and Daljeet Singh (42) agreed to the cremation after hours of negotiations involving police officials and farmer leader Rakesh Tikait.Tikait was present when Satnam Singh performed the last rites of his son Lavpreet Singh in the family’s agricultural field in Palia tehsil in Lakhimpur Kheri late in the afternoon.But the family of Gurvinder Singh (22) of Matera tehsil refused to cremate him till a second autopsy is done and alleged that he was shot dead.“We don’t want to conduct his last rites after a false post-mortem report,” a relative said.Punjabi actress Sonia Mann, who has been actively supporting protests against the three central agri laws, also reached Gurvinder Singh’s village and supported his family’s demand.Gurvinder’s family said Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is under detention in Sitapur, talked to his father over the phone.Maan accused the UP government of creating “pressure” through the district administration on the family.“The body will not be sent for last rites till a second post mortem is performed in Delhi,” she said.The mortal remains of Nachattar Singh of Dhaurahra tehsil in Lakhimpur Kheri were consigned to flames by his son Mandeep Singh, who is posted in Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).In Bahraich, the family members of Daljeet Singh performed his last rites.The UP government is facing massive flak after eight people were killed in violence during a protest against the farm laws in Lakhimpur. Four of the dead were farmers who were allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers. The others were BJP workers and a driver who were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and lynched by the protesters.The UP Police have lodged a case against Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son but no arrest has been made.Additional Director General (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar announced on Monday that the government will order a probe headed by a retired high court judge and give compensation of Rs 45 lakh each to the families of the dead farmers. Their kin will also get a government job.The injured will get Rs 10 lakh.

That is illegal. You cannot conduct post mortem at night. That shows they have something to hide. When we met the family of Lovepreet Singh, a 20-year-old victim, today they said they did not want to cremate their child and wanted to see the post mortem report first. They also lamented that the son of junior home minister had not been arrested yet,” Ghosh said moments before Lovepreet was cremated after UP administration and families of three deceased farmers reached an agreement to conduct the last rites.Only one farmer’s body –19-year-old Gurwinder Singh—will be sent for a second post mortem to determine gunshot injuries.Meanwhile, TMC’s Sushmita Dev told TNS that all families of deceased farmers said they wanted justice and not compensation.“The families, all Sikhs, also want the state administration to apologise for calling their kin anti-nationals and to recognise them as genuine farmers. The families are aghast that the post mortems did not speak of gunshot wounds which they said several eyewitnesses corroborated. Lovepreet’s family also told us they wanted a post mortem outside of UP preferably in Punjab,” Sushmita said asking why the junior home minister had not stepped down yet and what justice could anyone expect with the MoS Home in his chair considering police coming under him.The TMC MPs visiting the area include Dola Sen and Pratima Mandal. The visit comes at a time when the TMC is in talks with the Akhilesh Yadav led Samajwadi Party for an alliance for the 2022 UP elections.Asked how they managed to come to the victims when several other leaders were still in detention, Sushmita Dev said they reached the area last night and headed for Lakhimpur early morning Tuesday, sure that the entire state machinery and police would be busy with the Prime Minister’s Lucknow visit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-violence-tmc-leaders-first-to-meet-victims-kin-question-post-mortems-at-night-320521
