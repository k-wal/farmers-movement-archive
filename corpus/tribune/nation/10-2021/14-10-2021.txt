14-10-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||India ‘notes’ Bhutan-China MoU to resolve boundary dispute||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 14India has “noted” the signing of the MoU on Thursday between Bhutan and China on the “Three-Step Roadmap for Expediting the Bhutan-China Boundary Negotiations” which may also include discussions on Doklam.“You are aware that Bhutan and China have been holding boundary negotiations since 1984 just like India,” said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.Asked if Doklam is among the boundaries being discussed and could be part of resolution package that would give control over it to China, Bagchi said, “For the moment, I will limit myself to these comments.”The announcement however is not sudden. During the Expert Group Meeting in Kunming in April this year, the two sides had agreed on the “Three-Step Roadmap” that will help expedite the ongoing boundary negotiations.China-Bhutan boundary talks had traditionally focused on two areas. One is two valleys—Pasamlung and Jakarlung—and the other is Doklam, along the trijunction with India. But around the time of the Galwan Valley incident last year, China had opened a new front by raising objections about Sakteng Sanctuary in Bhutan about which there was no discord earlier.Bhutan Foreign Minister Tandi Dorji and Chinese Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Jianghao signed the MoU during a virtual signing ceremony. It will be exchanged between the two sides through the diplomatic channels.“The MoU on the Three-Step Roadmap will provide a fresh impetus to the Boundary Talks. It is expected that the implementation of this Roadmap in a spirit of goodwill, understanding and accommodation will bring the boundary negotiations to a successful conclusion that is acceptable to both sides,” said the Bhutanese government in a statement.Boundary negotiations between Bhutan and China began in 1984 and the two sides have held 24 rounds of Boundary Talks and ten rounds of meeting at the Expert Group level.“The negotiations which have been conducted in a spirit of understanding and accommodation have been guided by the 1988 Joint Communique on the Guiding Principles for the Settlement of the Boundary and the 1998 Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace, Tranquility and status quo in the Bhutan-China Border Areas,’’ added the statement from Thimphu.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-notes-bhutan-china-mou-to-resolve-boundary-dispute-324556

The schools will be informed separately about the full scheme so that they can make the necessary preparations,” he added.Bhardwaj further said the second-term examination would be conducted in March-April, 2022 and whether it will be objective or subjective-type will depend on the Covid situation in the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/term-1-board-exams-for-classes-10-12-to-be-conducted-offline-date-sheet-on-october-18-cbse-324550

Today you were seen playing Garba. But whenever people are in distress and they are calling you, you are seen sick, on a wheelchair or walking with support. It really hurts. God should always keep you healthy,” he tweeted.Defending the Bhopal MP, her elder sister Upma Thakur told PTI over phone that she suffers from a spine problem.“You never know at which moment it can create problems for her. There is a problem with her L4 and L5 bones (vertebrae) as they got dislocated because ATS Maharashtra (investigators) threw her on the floor.” “Whenever these problems occur, the lower portion (of her body) is left with no sensation....It can happen even when she sits or gets down from a vehicle,” Upma said.MP Congress media department’s vice president Bhupendra Gupta said, “There are different faces of Bhopal MP. Sometimes she is seen in a wheelchair, sometime she plays Garba and kabaddi too. She has many faces.”   Her past claims of defeating coronavirus with cow urine are worth publishing in international journals, he said in another jibe.“People of Madhya Pradesh want to know which is her right face — one playing garba or kabaddi or that of a wheelchair-bound person?” he asked.The 51-year-old BJP MP is out on bail in the Malegaon blast case on health grounds and had sought exemption from personal appearance in the trial court citing her physical condition. She was in prison for almost nine years and was granted bail in 2017.The case against her relates to bomb blasts at Malegaon in Maharashtra on September 29, 2008, in which at least six persons died. The case was probed by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took it over. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pragya-thakur-out-on-bail-on-health-grounds-seen-playing-kabaddi-in-latest-video-324545

His simplicity is very inspiring. I wish Maa Durga for his good health,” Singh tweeted about the meeting and also posted a photo of him with Narayan.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also called Bhulai Bhai in April last year during the first wave of Covid pandemic and sought his blessings. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajnath-meets-senior-most-bjp-member-106-year-old-bhulai-bhai-324544
14-10-2021||Lucknow||‘Naya naya Hindu’ Akhilesh doesn’t know difference between Ram Navami and Maha Navami: BJP||Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav invited the ire of the BJP on Thursday over his tweet wishing people on the occasion of “Ram Navami” on a day when Hindus worldwide celebrate “Maha Navami”, with the ruling party describing him as “naya naya Hindu”.In the tweet, Yadav extended his greetings to people on “Ram Navami”.Prominent among those who were quick to respond was Amit Malviya of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who pointed out that Ram Navami is celebrated in the month of “Chaitra” in the Hindu calendar, which falls in March-April, and during this period, people celebrate “Maha Navami”, which is a day of worshipping goddess Durga.“This is what happens when those who open fire on kar sevaks put up the drama of being Hindus with elections approaching,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.The official Twitter handle of the Uttar Pradesh BJP posted two pictures side by side—one of Yadav and another of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath performing “kanya pujan”—and said “the difference is clear—naya naya Hindu (new Hindu) and Sanatani Hindu”.“Akhileshji, who does not know the difference between Ram Navami and Maha Navami, talks about Ram and Parashuram. Do not fool the people (maat pehnaye topi), it looks better on you,” it said.SP workers often wear red caps.The SP had announced that a 108-foot-tall statue of Lord Parashuram will be installed in Lucknow.The BJP has claimed that the SP president has withdrawn his tweet and his Twitter handle now conveys his wishes to people on Maha Navami.BJP leaders also retweeted a similar tweet by senior Congress leader Anand Sharma, who wished people on Ram Navami.

14-10-2021||Mumbai||No evidence against Sameer Khan in drugs case: Court||A special court here which granted bail to Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan has observed that there was no evidence to establish that Khan was involved in drug trafficking.Special judge for Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act cases AA Joglekar granted bail to Khan and two others last month. A detailed order became available on Wednesday.Khan, son-in-law of Nationalist Congress Party leader and Maharashtra Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik, was arrested on January 13, 2021, by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) for alleged possession of drugs.The prosecution alleged that Khan was part of a drug syndicate and involved in peddling as well as consumption of the contraband.In the ruling on his bail plea, the court pointed out that as per the chemical analysis (CA) report, cannabis was not detected in 11 samples, and hence “theory of the prosecution with regard to the invoking of section 29 fails”.Section 29 of the NDPS Act deals with abetment or being part of a criminal conspiracy to commit offenses listed under the Act.The court further noted that the NCB did not bring on record anything to prove conspiracy at least prima facie (on the face of it).“It is evident that when the CA report relied upon by the prosecution is negative, no charge under Section 27 A can be sustained,” it further said.Section 27 A deals with punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders.The NCB has claimed that the accused conspired to procure, sell and transport 194.6 kilograms of ganja (cannabis).Khan and five others were dealing with ‘commercial quantities’ of the drug which carries a maximum punishment of 20 years, the central anti-drug agency claimed.Under the NDPS Act, punishment is milder when the quantity of the drug is small; when it exceeds a certain limit, it is categorized as ‘commercial’ and attracts stricter punishment.Khan, in his bail application, had cited a forensic lab report which said 11 of 18 samples sent to it had no trace of cannabis.The NCB is likely to approach the high court to challenge the bail order, prosecution sources said.Against the backdrop of a recent raid by the NCB on a cruise ship off Mumbai coast during which actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan was arrested, Nawab Malik earlier in the day alleged that the agency had “malafide intentions” and was involved in “selective leaks” to frame up people. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-evidence-against-sameer-khan-in-drugs-case-court-324531

In 2007 we won Goa...in 2009 we won Delhi. In 2012, we unfortunately lost Goa, in 2014 we lost Delhi. In 2017, you (referring to party workers) won Goa, but our legislators lost Goa,” he said, while noting that the Congress was defeated in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The former Union minister said this time, his party is moving forward with courage and confidence and "will win Goa in 2022 and Delhi in 2024".In the 2017 Goa Assembly polls, the Congress emerged as the single largest party by winning 17 seats in the 40-member House. But, the BJP at that time forged an alliance with some regional outfits and independent legislators to form government.The Congress currently has only four legislators in the state.Chidambaram said, "The history is ours...we are beginning today on an auspicious day and our office has been inaugurated by a valuable statesman and former chief minister Pratapsingh Rane."  Addressing the Congress workers, he said they should remember the "golden years" when Goa moved forward, progressed and developed in the field of industries, schools, colleges and roads."We will bring back that golden age of Goa, beginning 2022. I wish you go forward with courage and confidence,” he said to the Congress workers.Chidambaram said Goa would not be colonised by "some political party"."Goa cannot become a political colony of any invader. Goa will be governed by Goans. Goa is of Goans, by Goans and for Goans. Goa will be ruled by Goans,” he said, without naming any political outfit.

He also lauded the work done by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) while handling this project.The tunnel will not only strengthen national security, but also augment the transportation facilities for the local people and consequently, boost their socio-economic conditions, he said."This tunnel, which has been made with state-of-the-art features, will prove to be the lifeline for not just Tawang, but the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh," Singh said.The tunnel goes through Sela Pass and is expected to cut down the distance to the China border through Tawang district in Arunachal Pradesh by 10 km. The construction work of the tunnel is expected to be over by June 2022."The breakthrough blast of the Sela main tunnel shows your (BRO's) hard work and your commitment towards the country's security and socio-economic development," the defence minister said.He also flagged off a motorcycle expedition of the BRO.Singh said 75 personnel of the BRO and the Army will participate in the motorcycle expedition that will cover a distance of 20,000 km passing through many states and Union territories.The Sela tunnel would cut down the travel time between the Army's 4 Corps headquarters at Tezpur in Assam and Tawang by at least an hour.Moreover, it would ensure that National Highway 13, especially the 171-km stretch between Bomdila and Tawang, remains accessible in all weather conditions.In the 2018-19 budget, former Union finance minister Arun Jaitley had announced the Centre's plan to build a tunnel through Sela Pass, located at an elevation of 13,700 feet, which will ensure a faster movement of troops in Tawang, a strategically-located district bordering China.

14-10-2021||Mumbai||NCB has ‘mala fide intentions’, making ‘selective leaks’ to frame people, alleges Nawab Malik||Against the backdrop of various raids conducted by the NCB, including on some high-profile people, Maharashtra minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik on Thursday alleged that the anti-drugs agency had "mala fide intentions" and is involved in "selective leaks" to frame people.Addressing a press conference, Malik said his son-in-law Sameer Khan, who was recently granted bail in a drugs case after nine months, would move the high court to seek quashing of charges levelled against him by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).Khan was arrested by the NCB in January this year in an alleged drugs case. He got bail last month.Apart from the recent drug bust on board a cruise liner off the Mumbai coast that led to the arrest of actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan, the NCB last year investigated a drug case linked to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and several other matters related to narcotics involving high-profile people.Malik last week had alleged that the NCB's raid on the cruise ship off the Mumbai coast on October 2 was “fake”, and no narcotic drugs were found during it.On Thursday, the minister alleged that the "NCB has mala fide intentions and is involved in only selective leaks to frame people".He said his security was beefed up after he started getting "threats" when he raised doubts over the NCB's investigations.Referring to the bail order issued by an NDPS court in connection with the case involving his son-in-law, Malik said there was "no prima facie evidence of a drug syndicate".It is surprising that an agency like the NCB cannot differentiate between drugs which fall under the NDPS Act and tobacco-related items, the NCP leader said. "It (NCB) said 'ganja' was seized (in the case involving Sameer Khan), but there was none. I just had to make things clear today after the bail order, since the BJP was targeting me over my son-in-law when I raised issues about the NCB's fake case of the cruise drug party," the NCP leader said.Malik claimed that his family faced trauma and stigma because of the NCB.

Two officials would be suspended by the Delhi government, the official said.The Delhi Police Crime Branch had on Tuesday registered a case after 32 officials of Tihar Jail were found to be complicit with the duo. The FIR was registered under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Indian Penal Code, and investigation was taken up.The Supreme Court had on October 6 directed suspension of Tihar jail officials, registration of case against them and full-fledged probe into their collusion with Sanjay and Ajay Chandra, based on Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana's report.The apex court had also directed that the officials of Tihar Jail who had been prima facie found to be complicit in the course of the inquiry be placed under suspension and directed the Union Ministry of Home Affairs to respond to the suggestions contained in the report submitted by Asthana.The former Unitech promoters had been shifted from the Tihar Jail here to Mumbai's Arthur Road Jail and Taloja Central Jail, following a Supreme Court order.The court had said that two reports of the Enforcement Directorate about the conduct of Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra and the connivance of Tihar Jail staff in flouting orders and undermining the jurisdiction of the court had raised some “serious and disturbing” issues.

14-10-2021||Washington||Important for India to focus on green investment post-pandemic: IMF||As the Indian economy recovers from the Covid pandemic that hit it hard, it is important for the country to focus on public investment, particularly in green sectors, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday.“As we move towards the recovery, it is also important to focus on public investment, particularly on green investment, so that the recovery can be inclusive and green,” IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department Deputy Director Paolo Mauro told reporters during a news conference here.He said India's debt is at the ratio of about 90 per cent, and it is important to give a signal that there is a medium-term fiscal framework in place that ensures investors that the debt ratio will decline in the medium term.Responding to a question, Mauro said the situation is improving when it comes to the epidemic.It is very different from a few months ago, he said, adding, fortunately, the number of cases is declining and the vaccination is becoming more widespread.“On the economic front, therefore, even though the situation is improving, the priority remains to address the health emergency. It remains to provide ample support, particularly to the poorer segments of the population through social protection, employment benefits, and so on,” Mauro said.“In terms of more recent reforms, one that I would like to highlight is the National Asset Reconstruction Company, the so-called bad bank. This is potentially very promising because it is important to tackle non-performing loans,” he said.This has been a long-standing drag on credit, and potentially this is very promising, he added.“It is very important that both the governance and the independence of such so-called bad banks be in place so that the costs to public finances can be kept under control and one can go back to promoting inclusive growth,” Mauro said.

Here is that letter to Savarkar’s brother,” Ramesh said, sharing the letter.Owaisi said the BJP would soon declare Savarkar as “father of the nation” after the Defence Minister called him “mahanayak” of Indian freedom struggle.The AIMIM chief said the first petition Savarkar wrote was in 1911, six months after getting to prison and Gandhi was then in South Africa. Savarkar wrote again in 1913-14 and Gandhi’s advice is from 1920.Historian S Irfan Habib said, “Monochromatic history writing is really changing, led by the minister who claims Gandhi asked Savarkar to write mercy petitions. At least it is accepted now that he did write.”Rajya Sabha MP Rakesh Sinha said, “The Congress opposes Savarkarji who never integrated with the British and exhibited the highest sacrifice for the motherland. However, some people had regular dining at Mountbatten’s home.”Slamming the critics, Savarkar’s biographer Vikram Sampath said, “Please refer to Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi. In my Vol. 1, I had stated in 1920, Gandhiji advised Savarkar brothers to file a petition and even made a case for his release through an essay in Young India on May 26, 1920,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/history-distorted-oppn-slams-rajnath-singh-over-gandhi-remark-324293

14-10-2021||New Delhi||SC: Failure to take extra care not negligence in accident cases||Mere failure to avoid a collision by taking some extraordinary precaution does not in itself constitute negligence in motor accident claim cases, the Supreme Court has ruled.A Bench led by Justice Hemant Gupta said that to establish contributory negligence in such cases, some act or omission, which materially contributed to the accident or the damage, should be attributed to the person against whom it is alleged.Allowing the appeal of claimants K Anusha and two minors, the top court reversed the findings of the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and the Karnataka High Court on the point of contributory negligence. It enhanced the compensation granted by the HC to the claimant from Rs 17,34,156 to Rs 50,89,960.However, the SC accepted the appellant’s contention that findings of the courts below were not based on any evidence as there was nothing on record to indicate that the driver was not driving at moderate speed or that he didn’t follow traffic rules. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-failure-to-take-extra-care-not-negligence-in-accident-cases-324287

Today 21st century India is leaving behind old practices. The Gati Shakti Plan will give impetus to 21st century India and remove obstacles from its path,” the PM said.He said the subject of infrastructure was not even visible in political party manifestos.“Today some parties are criticising the development of infrastructure necessary for the development of the country even though it is globally accepted that building quality infrastructure is the only route to sustainable development which also boosts economic activity and creates large-scale jobs,” the PM said, adding that India was today working at a much faster speed than ever.Citing a study showing logistics cost in India at 13 per cent of the GDP, the PM said the plan would reduce these costs and lay the foundation for a self-reliant India over the next 25 years. He said people, industry, manufacturers and farmers were at the heart of the plan, which would bring government departments on one platform, enhancing efficiency.“Gaps between macro planning and micro implementation, lack of coordination between departments and advance information to the industry, an approach of working in silos were all hampering infrastructure development and leading to budget wastage. Such an approach dissipated energies instead of harnessing them. The new plan will change this and lead to optimum utilisation of resources,” the PM said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-launches-gati-shakti-plan-to-boost-infrastructure-324241

The company has denied the accusations.But thousands of pages of internal Amazon documents examined by Reuters — including emails, strategy papers and business plans — show the company ran a systematic campaign of creating knockoffs and manipulating search results to boost its own product lines in India, one of the company’s largest growth markets.The documents reveal how Amazon’s private-brands team in India exploited internal data from Amazon.in to copy products sold by other firms, and then offered them on its platform. The employees also stoked sales of Amazon private-brand products by rigging Amazon’s search results so that the company’s products would appear, as one 2016 strategy report for India put it, “in the first 2 or three … search results” when customers were shopping on Amazon.in.Among the victims of the strategy: a popular shirt brand in India, John Miller, which is owned by a company whose chief executive is Kishore Biyani, known as the country’s “retail king”.The 2016 internal report laid out Amazon’s strategy for a brand the company originally created for the Indian market called “Solimo”. The Solimo strategy, it said, was simple: “Use information from Amazon.in to develop products and then leverage the Amazon.in platform to market these products.”Amazon said: “As Reuters hasn’t shared the documents or their provenance with us, we are unable to confirm the veracity.” — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amazon-copied-products-rigged-search-results-data-324239

The Chinese government has never recognised the so-called Arunachal Pradesh established unilaterally and illegally by the Indian side and firmly opposes the Indian leader’s visit to the area.”Tells Beijing to resolve pending LAC issues‘Have never recognised so-called Arunachal established unilaterally’, says China‘Arunachal an integral part of India.

We reject such comments.” Though the visit took place on October 9, the Chinese reaction came two days after the Taiwan Foreign Ministry thanked India for touching national day messages on October 11. The MEA pointed out that the current situation along the LAC in the western sector has been caused by China’s unilateral attempts to alter the status quo in violation of the bilateral agreements. “We expect the Chinese side to work towards early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC in eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols rather than trying to link unrelated issues,” said Bagchi.In February last year, China had objected to Amit Shah’s visit to Itanagar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arunachal-integral-part-of-india-mea-junks-chinas-objection-to-venkaiah-naidus-visit-324236

Equally, there are instances happening elsewhere, is my concern.”Broadly echoing PM Narendra Modi’s observation over selective outrage over violation of human rights, Sitharaman also attacked economist Amartya Sen, who in June had said the Modi government was focused on taking credit for its actions, resulting in schizophrenia that led to the second Covid wave.Double-digit growthIndia looking at registering double-digit growth this yearNo coal shortageReports of coal crisis ‘absolutely baseless’Speaking during a conversation at Harvard Kennedy School on Tuesday, the minister said India had issues of such nature happening in different parts of the country.

Due course of justice will also have an inquiry process to establish it.”On the issue of turning defensive on such issues, Sitharaman said, “I will talk for India. I will talk for justice for the poor. I will not be mocked. And if it is mocking, I will be defensive to stand up and say ‘sorry, let’s talk on facts’. That’s my answer for you.” Sitharaman defended the three farm legislations by pointing out that they had been discussed by several parliamentary panels for over a decade.Indicating that the government would have no rethink on the farm laws, she said, “When the farm laws were brought in the Lok Sabha, there was an elaborate discussion. It was only when it came to the Rajya Sabha, there was a lot of noise and disturbance.” “The highest amount of procurement, the largest-ever payment per farmer under the minimum support price (MSP) has happened in the last seven years,” she asserted.“So we have not been told what it is that they’re protesting against as yet and the minister is willing to talk even today,” said Sitharaman.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-killings-condemnable-but-outrage-selective-says-sitharaman-324230

His condition is stable. He is undergoing routine treatment. We will share any updates as needed. We thank our friends in media for their concern,” said Jha.This is Singh’s third admission to AIIMS this year. He was first admitted in April after testing positive for Covid 19 and later again in May after complaining of uneasiness in the chest.Earlier in 2009, Singh had undergone a coronary artery bypass surgery under a team of surgeons led by cardio-thoracic surgeon Ramakant Panda at AIIMS.

We reject such comments. Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India,” Bagchi said.He was responding to a question on comments by a spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry objecting to Naidu’s visit to Arunachal Pradesh over the weekend.“Indian leaders routinely travel to the state of Arunachal Pradesh as they do to any other state of India. Objecting to the visit of Indian leaders to a state of India does not stand to reason and understanding of Indian people,” Bagchi said.China has been objecting to visits of Indian leaders to Arunachal Pradesh, saying it is a part of South Tibet.The fresh war of words between the two sides came three days after the 13th round of military talks on the 17-month eastern Ladakh standoff ended in a stalemate.“Further, as we have mentioned earlier, the current situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Western Sector of the India-China border areas has been caused by unilateral attempts of the Chinese side to alter the status quo in violation of the bilateral agreements,” Bagchi said.The government often refers to eastern Ladakh as Western Sector.“Therefore, we expect the Chinese side to work towards early resolution of the remaining issues along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols rather than trying to link unrelated issues,” Bagchi said.A day after the 13th round of military talks, Indian Army said the “constructive suggestions” made by it were neither agreeable to the Chinese side nor it could provide any “forward-looking” proposals.On its part, the Chinese PLA’s Western Theatre Command said India insisted on “unreasonable and unrealistic demands, adding difficulties to the negotiations.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-strongly-rejects-chinas-objection-to-vice-president-venkaiah-naidus-arunachal-visit-324083

Equally there are instances happening elsewhere, is my concern.“India has issues of such nature happening in very many different parts of the country equally. I would like you, and many others, including Dr Amartya Sen, who all know India, to raise it at every time when it happens, not just raise it when it suits us because it’s a state where BJP is in power, one of my cabinet colleague’s son is in probably trouble, and also assume that it’s actually them who did it and not anybody else. Due course of justice will also have a complete inquiry process to establish it,” she said.“And it’s not being defensive about my party or my Prime Minister. It’s being defensive about India. I will talk for India, I will talk for justice for the poor. I will not be mocked at. And if it is mocking, I will be defensive to stand up and say ‘Sorry, let’s talk on facts’. That’s my answer for you,” she said.Ashish Mishra was named in an FIR following allegations that he was in one of the vehicles that mowed down four farmers protesting over UP Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit on October 3.To a question on the farmers’ protests, Sitharaman said that the three Acts which the government brought in were discussed by the various parliamentary committees over a decade.She said all the three Acts have been discussed variously by the state governments, by the Center after the BJP came into power in 2014.“This has been in the making for a decade now. Every stakeholder has been consulted,” she said.“When the farm laws were brought in the Lok Sabha, there was an elaborate discussion and the agriculture minister gave his reply as well. It was only when it came to the Rajya Sabha, there was a lot of noise and disturbance,” she said.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26 last year, seeking repeal of three farm laws enacted in September.Dubbing these laws as “anti-farmer”, these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislations would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.Sitharaman said the protesters belong to one state and some parts of other states—“Punjab, Haryana and some parts of western Uttar Pradesh.” She said the government has been saying that it is willing to talk with the protesters and has been engaging with them.The government has asked pointedly what is that one aspect in any one of the three laws which have been passed to which the protesters object, she said. “We are willing to talk about it, tell us that one particular aspect in any one of the three laws.        Till date, we have not had even one particular aspect which is being questioned. And therefore, the protesters are not sure on what score they are protesting, what is it that they are objecting.“Then there’s this issue about the minimum support price to be given to farmers,” she said, adding that the MSP are announced well in time and the farmers can decide whether they want to grow a crop or not and they can otherwise choose to grow something else.She said once the farmers choose to grow any of these, for which a minimum support price is announced and procurements are done, through direct benefit transfer using technology, money is deposited as a lump sum into their accounts.“The highest amount of procurement, the largest ever payment per farmer under the minimum support price which is declared has happened in the last seven years after Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has come. Highest ever.“The number of farmers, the total quantum of money, total quantum of grain procured in each one of them - the highest as has happened season after season in the last seven years,” she said.Highlighting that there are recorded conversations “which you can see of farmers even from Punjab, even from Haryana”, she said farmers have got the entire amount into their account.“This is verifiable, not a claim which I’m making. You can go and check it out. Highest amount and the entire amount is given into the account directly the day after procurement is done. No staggering, no delaying,” she said.“So we have not been told what it is that they’re protesting against as yet and the minister is willing to talk even today.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-condemnable-nirmala-sitharaman-324063

14-10-2021||Aditi Tandon ||Congress urges President to dismiss MoS Mishra, initiate judicial probe into Lakhimpur Kheri violence||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 13A five-member Congress delegation on Wednesday called on President Ram Nath Kovind urging his intervention for dismissal of Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra and instituting an independent judicial probe by two sitting judges of the Supreme Court in the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri violence that killed eight people, including four farmers.The delegation, comprising Rahul Gandhi, former ministers AK Antony, Mallikarjun Kharge and Ghulam Nabi Azad and AICC general secretary Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Vadra, told the President that ends of justice could not be served until Mishra was sacked considering his son Ashish Mishra is an accused in the case and was seen “my many eyewitnesses at the scene of the crime”.After the meeting, Priyanka said the President had assured them that he would talk to the government on the issue today itself while Rahul noted that no justice could be done until the junior minister was dismissed.Citing Mishra’s September 27, 2021 provocations to farmers where he said “mend your ways or I will” and a pending high court appeal against Mishra’s acquittal in a murder case, the Congress in a memorandum to the President said, “Despite this context of criminality and abuse of power, Ajay Mishra continues in office as the Union MoS Home Affairs. Given that the BJP leaders, including UP CM Adityanath, continue to make conciliatory statements towards him, suggests this situation is unlikely to change without intervention. Mishra’s role is also yet to be investigated and the same is unlikely while he continues in office.”Terming the Kheri violence a “deliberate act of murder”, the Congress leaders said, “Lakhs of farmers have been protesting against the three black farm laws at the doorstep of Delhi for close to a year now. The Modi government has refused to relent or have a meaningful conversation with them. Their policy appears to be to tire and retire the annadatas, a strategy doomed to failure.”Citing minister Mishra’s anti-farmer statements made on the day of Bharat Bandh on September 27, the Congress memorandum said, “How can justice be done when the original provocation came from Union MoS Home Affairs himself?”The delegation said that on October 3 as farmers carried out their peaceful protests, a cavalcade of vehicles (two owned by the minister and family) mowed down four farmers (and a journalist).“It was one of the most gruesome and premeditated acts of bone-chilling murder ever seen and caught on camera. Multiple eyewitnesses have confirmed that the minister’s son Ashish Misra was in the vehicle,” the leaders said, adding that an FIR was registered and Ashish Mishra arrested only after Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi visited the families of the deceased."Justice cannot be done until the MoS Home is sacked. This is the voice of not just the families of the deceased but of all the farmers and this voice is being suppressed," Rahul Gandhi told reporters after the meeting.Priyanka said the President had assured them that he would talk to the government today itself on this matter. “This is the demand of the people and not just of the Congress Party,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-urges-president-to-dismiss-mos-mishra-initiate-judicial-probe-into-lakhimpur-kheri-violence-324017
