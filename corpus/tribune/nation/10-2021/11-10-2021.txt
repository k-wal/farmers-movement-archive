11-10-2021||New Delhi||Lakhimpur Kheri: As UP elections approach, Opposition pressure mounts to get Ajay Kumar Mishra ‘Teni’ dismissed||After son Ashish Mishra’s arrest, opposition’s pressure is growing on the ruling BJP for the dismissal of his father Ajay Mishra Teni, the Minister of State for Home in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s council. However, amid the ongoing political slugfest over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, the BJP appears to be firm that it will not yield to any pressure and that Prime Minister Modi will take the final call after the police investigation has been completed.Congress leaders held ‘maun vrat’ led by general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra across the country on Monday to demand the resignation of the union minister. Maharashtra too witnessed a statewide bandh with the ruling coalition—Shiv Sena, NCP, and Congress—protesting against the killing of farmers in poll-bound UP last week.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s deadline to sack and arrest Mishra too is ending on the day the unions are holding the ‘antim ardas/bhog’ ceremony for the four farmers and a journalist killed at Tikonia in the Lakhimpur Kheri district on October 12.    Though his son has been arrested, Mishra has denied his involvement in the incident saying that there was no evidence against him. The sources say Mishra told the same to Home Minister Amit Shah when he met him after the incident. There are also “three-four unedited videos showing the complete and exact sequence of events, including the role of protesting farmers in the incident”, they claim.“If there is even a shred of evidence against Mishra, the top leadership will take cognisance and act against him. However, the BJP will not yield just because the Opposition wants this,” they add.The sources say the party’s UP unit met central leaders in charge of state matters on Monday to discuss the issue and also plans for the upcoming elections to the 403-member Assembly. The party had won as many as 312 seats in the 2017 elections with a vote share of 39.67 percent. “Our aim is to focus on constituencies in which the BJP lost or is not so strong,” they say.The general belief in the BJP is that the Lakhimpur incident “will not majorly impact” its prospects in the 2022 elections. Mishra, a strong Brahmin leader from the region, is a “big influencer in the region”. Besides, by sacking him the BJP cannot risk further antagonising the Brahmin community, which is believed to be “upset with Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath”, a Thakur by caste.Meanwhile, the CPM too has sought the removal of Mishra from the government saying “justice will not be served with his continuation as minister”.Over the next 100 days, BJP will hold 100 programmesAmid the suspense over the future of Ajay Mishra Teni, BJP president JP Nadda today called a meeting to discuss strategy for the poll-bound state. Senior leaders, including general secretary organisation BL Santhosh, state in charge Dharmendra Pradhan, State chief Swatantra Dev Singh and general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal were present at the meeting held under the shadow of Lakhimpur Kheri incident.Though leaders insisted that the organisational meeting was all about charting out the organisational programmes, the buzz that high profile bureaucrat Navneet Sehgal had also been summoned by Nadda led to another spate of speculations.     Meanwhile, leaders said over the next 100 days (in the run-up to elections) the BJP will hold 100 outreach programmes. “The planning of the programmes, including meetings with ‘panna pramukhs’ and beneficiaries of welfare programmes of the government, were all part of the discussions,” they said.Leaders say that Ajay Mishra is firm that his son was not present at the spot. “The UP police have arrested him (the son), this is where the situation stands. The rest all depends upon the investigations of the police,” they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-kheri-as-up-elections-approach-opposition-pressure-mounts-to-get-ajay-kumar-mishra-teni-dismissed-323168
11-10-2021||Kollam (Kerala)||Kerala court convicts wildlife expert for killing wife using snake||Is it rarest of the rare? Will the death sentence be awarded? These are the questions in the minds of all those who were following the Uthra murder case in which the victim’s husband, a snake handler and wildlife expert, was on Monday convicted by a sessions court here for killing his wife by using a cobra.Besides holding the husband—Sooraj S Kumar—guilty of murder, Additional Sessions Judge-VI Manoj M also convicted him for poisoning, destruction of evidence and also attempt to murder for his first try at killing his then 25-year-old wife—Uthra—by using a viper.“Accused (Kumar) is produced in court. The accused is found guilty of the commission of offences punishable under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 302(murder), 328 (poisoning) and 201 (destruction of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code,” the court said.It also heard the convict and the prosecution on the quantum of sentence to be awarded, with the latter seeking capital punishment for him.The court listed the matter on October 13 for pronouncing the sentence. Sooraj had killed his wife Uthra by letting a cobra bite her in her sleep in May last year. After the verdict was pronounced, State Police Chief Anil Kant told reporters that the case was “a shining example of how scientifically and professionally a case was investigated”. He said it was a difficult case, as there were no eyewitnesses, but with the hard work and efforts of the investigating team led by Superintendent of Police (SP) Harishanker the guilt of the accused was established.He also told reporters that the accused was nailed by using forensic medicine, analysis of animal DNA and cyber data as well as an experiment using a dummy and a cobra snake to ascertain how the crime was committed.SP Harishanker, who also spoke to the reporters, said the convict’s YouTube and search history revealed the extent of research he had carried out on snakes.In fact, his search history revealed that when his wife was bitten by a viper in the first attempt at murder and was undergoing treatment in a hospital ICU, he was busy searching for a cobra snake while waiting outside the ward.“He was a snake handler and a wildlife expert, so he chose a weapon (snake) in which he was confident,” the officer told the reporters.He wanted to remove her from his life and at the same time wanted her property also and for that the only way was her accidental death, the officer said, explaining the motive behind the murder.Meanwhile, the victim’s family welcomed the verdict and appreciated the work of the police and the prosecution.The victim’s mother told a news channel that the verdict will not bring her daughter back and therefore, she wants the harshest punishment of the land—death—for the convict.Uthra’s father and brother too said the most stringent punishment should be awarded to the convict.Police had cracked the case following suspicion raised by Uthra’s family as it was the second time she suffered a snake-bite in three months.The Chairperson of the Kerala Women’s Commission also welcomed the verdict and said that the immediate arrest of the culprit and his timely conviction shows the “utmost vigilance of our judicial system”.

11-10-2021||New Delhi||Lakhimpur violence: Farmers to observe ‘Shaheed Kisan Diwas’ on October 12||Farmers protesting against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws will observe ‘Shaheed Kisan Diwas’ on Tuesday to pay tribute to the four farmers who lost their lives in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence recently, a statement by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha said.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farm unions, appealed to farmer organisations and progressive groups across the country to mark the occasion by organising prayer and homage meetings all over the country, followed by candle light vigils in the evening.“October 12 (tomorrow) will be marked as Shaheed Kisan Diwas all over India on SKM’s call. Tomorrow, the ‘antim ardaas’ of the martyrs of Lakhimpur Kheri massacre will take place in Tikunia at Sahebjada Inter College. Preparations are being made for the same and tens of thousands of farmers are expected to join this prayer meeting,” a statement said.The SKM urged people to light five candles outside their houses at 8 pm on Tuesday.The organisation also expressed its dismay at no action being taken against BJP MP Ajay Mishra, whose vehicle allegedly ran over the farmers at Lakhimpur Kheri. “It is shameful on the part of the Modi government that Ajay Mishra Teni has not been sacked yet. It was his vehicles that were in the convoy that killed innocent people,” it said.The body added that farmers will mark Dussehra by burning effigies of BJP leaders on October 15.Thousands of farmers from across the country have been camping at Delhi borders since November last, demanding repeal of the three farm laws that they claim would do away with the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws as agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides.

11-10-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav begins yatra on Tuesday to reach out to UP voters||Seeking to galvanise public support ahead of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav will commence a 'yatra' from Kanpur on Tuesday."The 'Samajwadi Vijay Yatra' yatra aims to make people aware of the corrupt, autocratic, and suppressive policies of the BJP government and to establish real democracy," the party said in a statement on Monday.Yadav will travel in a Mercedes bus, which has been turned into a 'rath' having posters of Akhilesh Yadav displayed on one side and that of party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav on the other, besides a picture of party leader Mohammad Azam Khan.A day before the yatra, the party released a 17-second video in which Akhilesh Yadav is seen talking to his father Mulayam Singh Yadav, and touching his feet to get blessings.BJP leader and UP government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh took a swipe at Akhilesh Yadav, saying "the one who dumped the harried people during the corona times is going to the public in his five-star rath" and termed it as "another insult to the people of the state".The SP said that yatra will start from Kanpur and in the first two days on Oct 12-13 it will cover Kanpur Dehat, Jalaun and Hamirpur."The yatra aims to provide justice to farmers, youths, Dalits, the deprived, the backward, minorities and all sections and rid the state of autocratic and suppressive government," SP spokesperson Rajendra Chowdhury said.  Chowdhury said it was the third such yatra by Akhilesh Yadav after the ones in  July 2001 and September 2011.  The politically crucial state is again headed for a heated multi-cornered contest with all major parties like the BJP, BSP, SP, and the Congress reaching out to voters. Smaller parties like the Aam Aadmi Party and the AIMIM too are in the fray.The BJP alleged that Akhilesh Yadav was "'scared and nervous" to accept that the UP government has been working for "a crime-free society, including the eradication of corruption, attachment of the properties of criminals and development of the state".In a statement, Sidharth Nath Singh said: "When CM Yogi was running from one district to another to provide relief to the people during corona, the SP leader was busy tweeting from his air-conditioned drawing room from where he will be going to land in his air-conditioned luxurious 'Rath' pretending to go to the people". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/akhilesh-yadav-begins-yatra-on-tuesday-to-reach-out-to-up-voters-323145

All necessary documents and relevant data will be available online,” a senior officer said.SELO is an acronym derived from CRPF’s motto—Service and Loyalty. Its first version, developed by NIIT was implemented in the mid-2000s and processed information relating to personnel details, payroll, operations, budget, and inventory.The new system will connect all locations and converge online functions for seamless exchange of information with single-point data entry and will be available for use by all personnel through a web portal and mobile app, though there would be strict access control, requisite security protocols and compartmentalization.Said to be one of the largest paramilitary forces in the world with a strength of about 3.5 lakh personnel, CRPF’s hierarchy comprises 213 executive battalions, 15 rapid action force battalions, 10 Cobra battalions, six women battalions, five signal battalions, one special duty group and one Parliament duty group. The force is divided into four zones, 23 sectors, 50 ranges, 44 group centres, 20 training institutions and 21 hospitals besides some other establishments.According to CRPF officers, SELO-2 is being designed and implemented as a turn-key project in collaboration with the industry. It is estimated that it could take about two years to complete.The functional aspects of the system will cover operational deployment, intelligence, training, decision-making support, budgeting, procurement, inventory control, document management, pay and allowances, postings, leave and personnel matters, official communication, legal issues, grievance redressal, and data analysis.While improving monitoring of workflow, SELO-2 will also provide a single and integrated view of CRPF’s information system across all administrative functions and geographical locations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/crpf-developing-new-it-network-to-interlink-all-its-offices-for-day-to-day-work-323126

11-10-2021||Mumbai||Shiv Sena backs Varun Gandhi over his stand on Lakhimpur Kheri violence||Backing BJP MP Varun Gandhi for his support to the farmers’ movement, especially after the Lakhmipur Kheri incident, the Shiv Sena on Monday said all farmer organisations should pass a resolution applauding him for his stand on the issue.An editorial in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' also asked whether the blood of other MPs had “turned cold” even after seeing the “horrific” incident at Lakhmipur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh where eight people, including four farmers, were killed earlier this month.The death of the four cultivators triggered strong reactions from farmer leaders, while opposition parties launched an attack on the BJP-led central and UP governments.“The country cannot afford attempts being made to spread animosity. Varun Gandhi is the grandson of (former prime minister) Indira Gandhi and son of Sanjay Gandhi. After seeing the Lakhmipur horror, his blood boiled and he expressed his opinion,” the editorial said.Varun Gandhi showed political courage without thinking of any consequence and condemned the killing of farmers, the Marathi publication noted.“Farmer leaders should pass a resolution applauding Varun Gandhi,” said the Sena, which parted ways with long-term ally BJP after the Maharashtra Assembly polls in 2019 over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post.The editorial said the 'Maharashtra bandh', called by the ruling allies Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress in the state on Monday, is for those who cannot express their feelings openly. Varun Gandhi on Sunday warned against attempts to turn the Lakhimapur Kheri incident into a "Hindu vs Sikh battle", saying it is dangerous to create these fault lines and reopen wounds that have taken a generation to heal.The Pilibhit MP, who was recently dropped from the BJP national executive, said the struggle for justice in Lakhimpur Kheri is about the "cruel massacre of poor farmers in the face of an arrogant local power elite," and the issue had no religious connotations.

11-10-2021||Mumbai||Special court seeks NCB’s reply to Aryan Khan’s bail application; to hear plea on October 13||A special court here on Monday directed the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) to file its reply on October 13 to a bail plea filed by Aryan Khan, son of film actor Shah Rukh Khan, arrested in connection with the seizure of banned drugs on board a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast.Special Judge VV Patil, hearing matters related to the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, said it would hear the bail plea on Wednesday (October 13).Aryan was arrested on October 3 and is currently lodged at the Arthur Road prison in Mumbai.He approached the special court for bail after his plea for the same was rejected by a magistrate's court last week on the grounds that it did not have the jurisdiction to decide the matter.On Monday, when Aryan's counsel Amit Desai mentioned the bail plea, NCB's advocates AM Chimalkar and Advait Sethna sought a week's time to respond and file their affidavit.They said the investigation in the case was still on and there was quite a lot of material collected by the agency and at this stage it needed to be seen if releasing Aryan on bail would hamper the probe.Desai, however, objected to it, saying a person's liberty is at question here, and argued that releasing the accused on bail would not stop the investigation."The bail will not stop the investigation. The NCB can continue their probe. That is their duty. But, keeping my client in custody, especially when there has been no recovery (of drugs) from him, is not required," Desai said."He (Aryan) has not been found in possession of any narcotics and there is no other material against him. Since his arrest, he has been in the custody of the NCB for a week and his statement was recorded twice. Why does he still need to be in jail?" the senior counsel argued.Chimalkar, however, said that the agency needed at least a few days time to file its reply."What Desai is arguing appears to be rosy, but this is not what the investigation reveals or divulges. Aryan Khan is in judicial custody. Whether his release on bail will affect or hamper our investigation needs to be seen," Chimalkar said.Sethna, appearing for NCB, told the court that there was no extreme urgency for the bail plea to be heard immediately. Desai then sought the court to hear and decide Aryan's plea separately, saying the recovery of drugs from each accused in the case was different.But, Chimalkar and Sethna opposed it and said the conspiracy is the same.Apart from Aryan, four other accused in the case - Arbaaz Merchant, Munmun Dhamecha, Nupur Sateja and Mohak Jaiswal - have also filed bail pleas in the special court.The court said it would start hearing Aryan's bail plea on Wednesday.Aryan has been charged with offences under the NDPS Act sections pertaining to possession, consumption and purchase of drugs.The NCB has so far arrested 20 people in the case.

At times, he has taken hard decisions for the welfare of the nation,” the Union Minister said.“I have closely seen Modi and his style of working. I have never seen a patient listener like him. Whatever may be the matter, he patiently listens to everyone and speaks the least, and then takes a proper decision. He takes decisions patiently after having considered suggestions given by all, including a small-time official or a worker,” said Shah.He also noted, “Modi has always maintained that he is in power to change the country for the better and not merely to run the government. So he does not hesitate in taking risky decisions, which may be against the party’s supporters but are in the interest of the nation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-narendra-modi-a-patient-listener-amit-shah-322809

On Saturday, Army Chief General MM Naravane had mentioned that the Army was prepared to “stay up there at the LAC”, if the Chinese did so.A brigade of the Western Command, which was tasked along the LAC, and an important “strike division” have been made part of the area of responsibility of the Central Command.Sources said the eastern flank of Himachal Pradesh, which was under an independent infantry brigade of the Western Command headquartered at Chandimandir, would now be part of the Central Command headquartered at Lucknow. A “strike division” of the Western Command headquartered at Dehradun would be part of the Central Command. An independent brigade has around 6,000 troops, while the numbers in a division can vary between 12,000 and 15,000.The Western Command and its three Corps — 2 Strike Corps at Ambala, 11 Corps at Jalandhar and 9 Corps at Yol (near Palampur in Himachal Pradesh) — will only look westwards. Now the LAC, barring eastern Ladakh, which is under the Northern Command, will be the responsibility of the Central Command in Himachal and Uttarakhand.The Eastern Command will continue to be responsible for the LAC in Sikkim and Arunachal. A source said there would be no movement of units or relocation of anyone, only the command structure had changed. This is also in line with the proposed theatre command structure that is being worked out.

Let alone interrogation, he has become a complainant in the case and an FIR has been registered on his statement. He was one of the occupants in the vehicle that first hit the farmers and killed five people. The videos clearly show that,” says Jagpal Singh Dhillon, a friend of farmer Lovpreet Singh who died after being run over by an SUV.In the latest FIR, registered at Tikonia police station, few metres from the crime spot on the Tikonia-Banbirpur road, Jaiswal says, “The complainant and other BJP workers were going in a Mahindra Thar (UP 31 AS 1000) to receive the chief guest (UP Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya). Hari Om was driving. My friend Shubham Mishra was in the vehicle. Miscreants among farmers suddenly attacked us with batons, bricks and stones. The driver lost balance due to injuries and halted. Protesters then started lynching Hari Om who died. They also lynched Shubham. I escaped otherwise I would have died too.”Back in Tikonia, friends and family members of victims of October 3 violence said the FIR fits into the ruling BJP’s pledge to punish everyone involved in the violence, including those who beat up the SUV occupants after the vehicles killed some farmers.Speaking to The Tribune, Vijay Mishra, the father of Shubham Mishra, one of the three BJP workers who died, said, “My son was seated behind Sumit Jaiswal in Thar. While Sumit escaped, Shubham could not. He was beaten up so badly, I had to identify him from his inner wear.”Vijay Mishra and his wife Sushma Mishra have sought a CBI probe into the killings. They maintain that outsiders had infiltrated the farmers’ gathering on October 3.“Local farmers could not have lynched our children. We know them. These were outsiders and anti-social elements. I was not informed of my son’s death until 12 hours after the incident. We ran from hospital to hospital to find him. When we did, his face was unrecognisable from the beating,” says a wailing Sushma Mishra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-2nd-fir-silent-on-suv-deaths-322798

After the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, the UP Police were busy stopping us from visiting the distraught families. To the accused, they were sending an invitation to come and talk. Can this happen in any other country,” asked the AICC general secretary in-charge of UP, citing summons to Mishra’s son Ashish, the prime accused in the case.Priyanka recalled the killing of Scheduled Castes in UP’s Sonbhadra and the rape of a Scheduled Caste girl in Hathras to say: “The state police attack the victims and protect the perpetrators.” She asked why the PM could not travel a mere 10 km from his residence to Delhi borders to speak with the protesting farmers. “He calls himself Gangaputra, but has insulted thousands of Gangaputras  who cultivate our land. Does he know of their struggles? Does he know they are getting power bills but no power and paddy and wheat procurement prices are falling,” she asked.In a jibe at the Air India sale, Priyanka remarked: “The PM last year bought two aircraft for himself at a cost of Rs 16,000 crore and he sold Air India to his industrialist friends for Rs 18,000 crore.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priyanka-gandhi-raises-lakhimpur-kheri-at-varanasi-rally-322800

11-10-2021||---||Needless panic, enough coal stock: Govt||New Delhi, October 10After several states, including Delhi, Rajasthan and Punjab, flagged blackout possibilities citing coal shortage at power plants, the Centre on Sunday said coal stock at power plants was sufficient for over four days and fears of power disruption were misplaced.Power Minister pulls up GAIL, Tata PowerPower Minister RK Singh on Sunday hit out at Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) and Tata Power for their “baseless SMSes to customers creating unnecessary panic about the situation”. “Such acts will be treated as acts of irresponsible behaviour,” Singh said, adding he had warned Tata Power CEO of action if such SMSes were sent.Coal Ministry claims72 lakh tonnes coal at power plants enough for 4 days400 lakh tonnes with Coal IndiaDelhi contradictsSeveral states, including Delhi, Punjab and even Gujarat, have flagged coal shortage, but the Centre is saying that CMs are lying. It is turning a blind eye to the problem. — Manish Sisodia, Delhi Deputy CMCoal Minister Pralhad Joshi said ample coal was available in the country to meet the demand of power plants. Power Minister RK Singh reiterated the assurance.This even as Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said unless the Centre acknowledged coal shortage, it would have a major crisis at hand that would hit the industry and the larger economy.Sisodia drew parallels between medical oxygen crisis during Covid second wave and the coal shortage, saying, “Several states, including Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, even Gujarat have flagged the coal shortage issue but the Centre is busy proving that CMs are lying. Turning a blind eye to the problem won’t solve anything. Unless they admit to the problem, there will be a massive crisis at hand.”The Coal Ministry in a statement said, “Any fear of disruption in power supply is entirely misplaced. Coal stock at power plant-end is about 72 lakh tonne, sufficient for four days and at Coal India- end, it is over 400 lakh tonne which is being supplied to the power plants.”Union Power Minister RK Singh also reviewed the coal stock position in all thermal power plants, including those supplying power to Delhi, and said an unnecessary panic has been created about coal shortage.“On October 9, the total dispatch of coal from all sources (Coal India, Singareni Collieries Company, Captive Coal Mines and imported coal) was 1.92 million tonne while the total consumption was 1.87 million tonne. The coal dispatch has exceeded the consumption, indicating shift to gradual building up of stock. The Coal Ministry and Coal India have assured ample coal availability to meet the demand of power plants. Any fear of disruption in power supply is entirely misplaced. Coal stocks at power plant are sufficient for over four days’ requirement and coal supply is being ramped up by CIL. Coal stocks at power plants will gradually improve,” Singh said.He said coal supply in monsoons is routinely impacted as extraction becomes difficult due to flooding of coal mines, but the situation improves once power demand drops.Singh today directed that distribution companies of Delhi would get as much power as requisitioned. “Whoever wants power can give us a requisition and we will supply,” he said.The minister added that GAIL India has been advised to make gas available from all sources to gas-based power plants in Delhi and NTPC has been told to offer normative declared capacity to the Delhi discoms as per their allocations from gas-based power plants under respective power purchase agreements.“If any discom is found to resort to load shedding despite being power available as per PPA, action would be initiated against them,” Singh added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/needless-panic-enough-coal-stock-govt-322805

11-10-2021||New Delhi||Centre scrambles all resources to avert power crisis||With states from Delhi to Andhra Pradesh sending warnings of a developing power crisis due to shortage of coal, the central government on Sunday pressed all resources at its command to ensure power plants have enough feedstock to generate electricity.While Union Power Minister R K Singh reviewed the coal stock position at all thermal power plants, including those units that supply electricity to distribution companies in the national capital, the Ministry of Coal said “ample coal is available in the country to meet the demand” and “any fear of disruption in power supply is entirely misplaced”.In a year when the country produced record coal, excessive rains in coal producing belt hit movement of the fuel from mines to power generation units, impacting power generation in many states, including Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh.Another factor that has contributed to the present crisis is power plants that used imported coal to generate electricity, have either curtailed generation or completely stopped as a spurt in international energy prices has made it difficult for them to meet the commitments to states at a particular rate.Tata Power, which has signed contracts to supply 1,850 MW of electricity to Gujarat, 475 MW to Punjab, 380 MW to Rajasthan, 760 MW to Maharashtra and 380 MW to Haryana from its imported coal-based power plant at Mundra in Gujarat, has stopped generation.After Singh’s review of coal stock position, the power ministry in a statement said the total despatch of coal from all sources (Coal India Limited, Singareni Collieries Company, Captive Coal Mines and imported coal) on October 9 was 1.92 million tonnes (19.2 lakh tonnes) against the total consumption was 1.87 million tonnes (18.7 lakh tonnes).“Coal despatch have exceeded the consumption, thereby indicating shift to gradual building up of coal stock,” it said adding the coal stock at power plant is sufficient for more than 4 days’ requirement and as the coal supply is being ramped up by Coal India Ltd (CIL), the coal stock at power plant would gradually improve.In a separate statement, the Coal Ministry said coal stock at power plant end is about 72 lakh tonnes, sufficient for four days requirement, and that the Coal India Limited (CIL) has more than 400 lakh tonnes of stocks, which is being supplied to power plants.The domestic coal-based power generation has grown by nearly 24 per cent in this year (till September 2021) based on a robust supply from the coal companies.“The daily average coal requirement at the power plants is about 18.5 lakh tonnes of coal per day whereas the daily coal supply has been around 17.5 lakh tonnes per day. This due to extended monsoons the despatches were constrained,” it said. “The coal available at the power plants is a rolling stock which gets replenished by the supplies from the coal companies on a daily basis.” Any “fear of coal stocks depleting at the power plant end is erroneous,” it said. “In fact this year, domestic coal supply has substituted imports by a substantial measure.”Singh, the statement said, has directed that distribution companies of Delhi will get as much power as requisitioned by them as per their demand.State-owned “NTPC and DVC have been directed to give full availability as per the requirement of DISCOMs,” it said adding state gas utility GAIL has been advised to make gas available from all sources to gas-based power plants in Delhi.NTPC has also been advised to offer normative declared capacity to the Delhi DISCOMs as per their allocations from gas based power plants under respective PPAs.“If any DISCOM is found to resort to load shedding despite being power available as per PPA, action would be initiated against them,” the statement warned.Despite heavy rains in the month of August-September, steep hike in power demand due to economic recovery and increase in prices of imported coal, domestic coal supply have sustained the operation of power plants and all out efforts are being made to ensure full power supply to the DISCOMs as per their requirements.The Coal Ministry said despite heavy rains in the coal field areas, CIL had supplied more than 255 million tonnes of coal to the power sector in this year which is the highest ever supply.Out of the total coal supply from all sources, present coal supply from CIL to power sector is more than 14 lakh tonnes per day and with the receding rains, this supply has already increased to 15 lakh tonnes and is set to increase to more than 16 lakh tonnes per day by the end of October 2021. The supply from SCCL and captive coal blocks shall contribute to another 3 lakh plus tonnes of coal every day.“Domestic coal supplies have supported power generation in a major way despite heavy monsoons, low coal imports and a steep hike in power demand due to economic recovery. It is expected that coal supplies are set to be a record high in the current financial year,” it said.Due to high international prices of coal, supply of power even under agreements by import based power plants has reduced by almost 30% while domestic based power supply has gone up nearly 24% in April-September this year, the statement said adding the imported coal based power plants have generated about 25.6 billion units against a program of 45.7 BU.“It may be noted that the comfortable coal position in the country is reflected by the fact that the CIL has been supplying more than 2.5 lakh tonnes daily to meet the demand of non power industries like aluminium, cement, steel etc. along with supply of coal to thermal plants of the country,” the statement added.

Driver Hari Om, who was driving the vehicle, and my friend namely Shubham Mishra, were going to welcome the chief guest,” the FIR, seen by PTI, stated.“The bad elements in the farmers’ protest had attacked the vehicle by bamboo sticks, bricks and stones due to which driver Hari Om got injured and stopped the car on the road side,” Jaiswal alleged.“After this, the said protesters who took Hari Om out of the car and started to thrash with bamboo sticks and sword. We were pelted with stones and tried to run away from there and during this the said persons caught my friend Shubham Mishra and started to beat him up,” Jaiswal alleged.He claimed he somehow managed to run away from the spot, otherwise, he too would “have been killed”.He claimed he later got to know through social media that Hari Om and Shubham Mishra have been killed while “two other unidentified” BJP workers have also died, according to the FIR.According to a submission made in the Supreme Court by the UP government, it has formed a special investigation team (SIT) for an unbiased and transparent probe into the two FIRs.So far, three accused in the first FIR, including the Union minister’s son Ashish Mishra, have been arrested, according to officials.

Not only is this an immoral & false narrative, it is dangerous to create these fault-lines & reopen wounds that have taken a generation to heal. We must not put petty political gains above national unity.”              Police had arrested Ashish Mishra, son of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra, in connection with the October 3 Lakhimpur violence.Farmer organisations have blamed the father-son duo for the incident and are alleging that the minister had made a provocative speech while his son was inside a vehicle that hit farmers. Both have denied the allegations.Ashish Mishra was named in an FIR following allegations that he was in one of the vehicles that mowed down four farmers protesting over Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit last Sunday.Two BJP workers and their driver were allegedly lynched by angry farmers in retaliation. Local journalist Raman Kashyap also died in the violence, which has triggered a political storm and put the BJP government on the back foot in poll-bound UP.Gandhi has been sympathetic to the farmers’ cause over their protests against three agricultural laws and often tweeted in their support, a stand which is said to have not gone down well with the BJP leadership.

11-10-2021||New Delhi||LAC row: India-China military talks last for over 8 hours||India on Sunday pressed for an early disengagement of troops in the remaining friction points in eastern Ladakh at the 13th round of military talks with China that lasted for around eight-and-half hours, sources in the security establishment said.It is learnt that a major focus of the Corps Commander-level talks was to complete the stalled disengagement at Patrolling Point 15 (PP-15).There was no official comment on the negotiations that took place on the Chinese side of the Chushul-Moldo border point in eastern Ladakh.The talks, which started at 10.30 am and ended at 7 pm, took place over two months after the last round of negotiations that resulted in the disengagement of troops from Gogra (Patrol Point-17A).India has been insisting that the resolution of outstanding issues in all friction points, including in Depsang is essential for an overall improvement in ties between the two countries.The Indian delegation is understood to have conveyed this view firmly at the 13th round of talks while pressing for bringing down tensions at Depsang.The talks took place in the backdrop of two recent incidents of attempted transgressions by the Chinese troops - one in the Barahoti sector of Uttarakhand and another in the Tawang sector in Arunachal Pradesh.Indian and Chinese troops were engaged in a brief face-off near Yangtse in the Tawang sector of Arunachal Pradesh around 10 days back and it was resolved within a few hours following talks between commanders of the two sides as per established protocols.Close to 100 soldiers of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) transgressed the LAC in the Barahoti sector of Uttarakhand on August 30 and returned from the area after spending a few hours.The two sides held the 12th round of talks on July 31. Days later, the two armies completed the disengagement process in Gogra, which was seen as a significant forward movement towards the restoration of peace and tranquillity in the region.The Indian delegation at Sunday’s talks was led by Lt Gen PGK Menon, the Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps.On Saturday, Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane had said if the Chinese military continues with its large-scale deployment in the eastern Ladakh region, then the Indian Army too will maintain its strength on its side which he said is “as good as what the PLA has done.”The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in the Gogra area in August.In February, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in line with an agreement on disengagement.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.

The anti-drugs agency officials recorded his statement, following which he was allowed to leave, the official said.The NCB personnel late Saturday night carried out multiple raids in Mumbai’s suburbs, including Goregaon. They also arrested one more person, identified as Shivraj Ramdas, from Santacruz area on Friday night in connection with the case of drugs seizure, the official said.So far, 19 people have been arrested in the case, including actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan.Aryan Khan and some others were arrested by the NCB last Sunday following a raid on a Goa-bound cruise ship, based on a tip-off that a party was to take place onboard the vessel.An NCB team led by its zonal director Sameer Wankhede had raided the ship and claimed to have recovered banned drugs.On Thursday, the court had rejected the NCB’s request for further custody of Aryan Khan and seven others and instead sent them in 14-day judicial custody.The NCB on Saturday also conducted searches at the residence and office of film producer Imtiyaz Khatri here in connection with the seizure of drugs from the cruise ship and also questioned him.The agency asked him to appear before it again on Monday, the official said.Khatri’s name cropped up during the interrogation of some of the accused persons, who were earlier arrested in the drugs seizure case, the official said, adding that the NCB has been cracking down on drug peddlers and suppliers in the metropolis.NCP leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Saturday alleged that the NCB had initially detained 11 people following raid on the cruise ship, but let off three of them, including the brother-in-law of BJP leader Mohit Bharatiya, a couple of hours after the operation.Bharatiya hit back saying he will file a defamation suit seeking Rs 100 crore in damages against Malik.

Local journalist Raman Kashyap also died in the violence.A medical team examined Ashish Mishra in the crime branch office here after which he was taken for production before a judicial magistrate, who sent him to 14-day judicial custody, senior prosecution officer SP Yadav told PTI.Also read: Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Union Minister's son Ashish Mishra arrested after 12 hours of questioningLakhimpur Kheri violence: Union Minister Ajay Mishra's son ‘evades’ crucial questionsHe said an application for police remand of Ashish Mishra was submitted to the judicial magistrate who fixed it for hearing at 11 am on Monday.A senior official said the Union minister’s son was taken to the district jail, where he has been placed in quarantine under the Covid-19 protocol.“Initially, inmates are kept in isolation, away from the main barrack. Jail food is being given to him. The quarantine period is of 14 days and his (medical) tests will be done,” the official said.There is also a “threat perception” angle, he told PTI but refused to give details.Ashish Mishra has been kept in Barrack No. 21, sources said.Union MoS (Home) Ajay Mishra reached his office on Sunday morning but maintained a distance from the media and refused to say anything on this issue.He remained in his office till around 1 pm.Meanwhile, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra at a rally in Varanasi on Sunday accused the government of the bid to save the minister’s son and said except BJP leaders and their “billionaire friends” nobody is safe in the country.“We will continue to fight till the Union MoS (Ajay Mishra) resigns,” she said. BJP’s Pilibhit MP Varun Gandhi too warned against attempts to turn the Lakhimapur Kheri incident into a “Hindu vs Sikh battle”.“To use the word ‘Khalistani’ liberally to describe the protesting farmers is not only an insult to the generations of these proud sons of the Tarai who have fought and shed blood on our borders, it is also extremely dangerous for our national unity if this provokes the wrong kind of reaction,” he said.Ashish Mishra, who is known as ‘Monu Bhaiya’ in the area, spent the night in the district jail. He had appeared before the SIT around 10.30 am on Saturday after a second summons was served to him the previous day when he did not turn up for interrogation.He was arrested around 11 pm on Saturday after being grilled by the SIT at the crime branch office in the Police Lines.Aged around 35, Ashish Mishra looks after the political activities of his father in his Kheri parliamentary constituency.The Supreme Court had on Friday questioned the non-arrest of the accused, directed preservation of evidence and mulled transferring the probe to another agency.Without mincing words, a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana had said the law must take its course against all accused and the government has to take all remedial steps in this regard to inspire confidence in the investigation of brutal murder of eight persons.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), which is spearheading the agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws, had alleged that the violence was held under a pre-planned conspiracy and demanded the arrest of the minister and his son.The farmer unions said if the government does not accept their demands by October 11, they will take out a ‘Shaheed Kisan Yatra’ from Lakhimpur Kheri with the ashes of slain farmers.A nine-member team headed by Deputy Inspector General of Police (Headquarters) Upendra Agarwal has been formed to investigate the FIR lodged against the minister’s son and others in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.
