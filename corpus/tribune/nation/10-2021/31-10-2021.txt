So, we at Sabyasachi have decided to withdraw the campaign," Sabyasachi in a post on Instagram.After pictures of the advertisement were posted on Instagram, there was a huge controversy with a section of social media users terming them as against Hindu culture and obscene. Hashtags such as #Sabyasachi_Insults_HinduCulture and #BoycottSabyasachi were trending on Twitter.Last week, FMCG major and wellness firm Dabur India withdrew its advertisement on the festival of Karva Chauth showing a lesbian couple celebrating in the ad campaign of its Fem Creme bleach and issued an unconditional apology.Dabur also faced backlash on social media platforms and also from the MP Home Minister, who had also issued an ultimatum against the company, known for its nature based wellness products.Talking to reporters at Datia in Madhya Pradesh, Mishra had said, "I have warned earlier about such advertisements. I am personally warning designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, giving him a 24-hour ultimatum. If this objectionable and obscene advertisement is not withdrawn, then a case will be registered against him and legal action will be taken. The police force will be sent for the action," Mishra said on Sunday.Earlier, Tata Group's jewellery brand Tanishq was forced to withdraw an advertisement that showed an interfaith couple at a baby shower organised for the Hindu bride by her Muslim in-laws.Clothing brand Manyavar too was at the receiving end when its advertisement featuring Bollywood actor Alia Bhatt in wedding attire, appeared to question an old tradition.

31-10-2021||New Delhi||Niira Radia questioned for four hours in Rs 300 crore loan embezzlement case||The Economic Offences Wing of the Delhi Police questioned Nayati Healthcare chairperson Niira Radia for nearly four hours in connection with an alleged Rs 300-crore loan embezzlement case, officials said on Sunday.A senior police officer said Radia joined the investigation on October 27 at the office of the Economic Offences Wing.“She was asked about 50 questions related to the alleged bank loan. Although she answered all the questions, her response was not found to be satisfactory. So, she will be asked to join the probe in the near future again as the investigation proceeds further,” he said.“After the registration of the case last year in connection with the alleged bank loan, the two parties had decided to settle the matter amicably, but later, when it did not happen, we had to investigate the matter thoroughly from all angles. Notices were also served to parties concerned to join the probe,” the officer explained.All bank accounts and related documents used for transactions by all the parties involved will be examined, police said.The Economic Offences Wing had earlier this month served notice to Radia and other promoters and directors of Nayati Healthcare and Research NCR Private Ltd to join the investigation in connection with the case.The development came with the recent arrest of Yateesh Wahaal, Satish Kumar Narula and Rahul Singh Yadav for misappropriation of crores of rupees in connection with the case.According to police, a complaint was filed by orthopaedic surgeon Rajeev Kumar Sharma against Naarayani Investment Pvt Ltd, holding company of Nayati Healthcare and Research NCR Pvt Ltd and its promotors and directors Radia; her sister Karuna Menon, Narula, Wahaal and others.Sharma has accused Naarayani Investment Pvt Ltd, Niira Radia, Karuna Menon, Satish Narula and Yateesh Wahaal of “cheating, criminal breach of trust, falsification of accounts, fraud, forgery, embezzlement of funds and other charges”.In his complaint, Sharma alleged that Naarayani had borrowed more than Rs 600 crore from various sources, including DHFL, and invested Rs 311 crore for acquiring a majority stake in Nayati Healthcare NCR.After taking over the management of the new entity, Naarayani and the four individuals got a loan of Rs 300 crore from Yes Bank for the development of a Gurgaon hospital, but instead, they siphoned off and embezzled the loan amount using fictitious transactions, Sharma alleged.He further alleged that the accused also borrowed Rs 60 crore from Yes Bank for another hospital project, but embezzled that fund as well.Sharma also claimed that the five accused wrongfully brought down his stake in Nayati Healthcare NCR from 49 per cent to 6.3 per cent in less than a year and increased their own stake to 93.7 per cent.Earlier, Nayati Healthcare had rejected the allegations terming it as “baseless” and had said that it had duly reported to the police certain issues of “misappropriation and maliciousness” detected in a forensic audit of activities of the previous management under Sharma. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/niira-radia-questioned-for-four-hours-in-rs-300-crore-loan-embezzlement-case-332466
31-10-2021||New Delhi||COP26 begins in Glasgow: Indian researchers launch tracking website to ‘debunk the narrative provided by many developed countries’||The United Nations climate summit, the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26), formally opened on Sunday in Glasgow, kicking off two weeks of hectic diplomatic negotiations among countries or parties to arrive at a common meeting ground to tackle the challenge of global warming—construct a consensus on unresolved issues of the Paris Agreement Rule Book, long-term climate finance, market-based mechanisms, etc.The 2019 talks had ended with no action being taken and there are high expectations from Glasgow where speaker after speaker today urged world leaders to fully implement the Paris Agreement and commit to more climate action to limit global warming to less than 1.5-degrees Celsius by the end of the century.UK’s Alok Sharma, a British MP and the President of COP26, called on countries of the world to work together, terming Glasgow summit the “last, best hope to keep 1.5C in reach”.A glacier in Antarctica was also named after the summit.Things are not expected to go easy as developing countries like India want global climate action to be guided by principles and values of climate justice and equity.India, which will pitch for technology transfer and climate finance—the two factors essential for a “level playing field between developed and developing countries” — today launched a tracking website to “build awareness, especially among the public of the global south, that climate action is a global collective action problem”.Built by private researchers, the website “Climate Equity Monitor” on global climate policy will monitor the performance of Annex-I Parties under the UNFCCC (developed countries) based on the foundational principles of the Climate Convention —equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDR-RC).The performance and policies of the Non-Annex-I Parties (developing countries) will be also provided for comparison.The website aims to “debunk the narrative provided by many developed countries, and global non-government organisations that focus attention continually on what developing countries must do, constantly demanding greater commitment and action from them”, officials said.Welcoming the initiative, Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said the website focusing on equity and climate action from a data and evidence-based perspective will encourage a vigorous discussion on this crucial issue and engage experts from all countries.The Monitor provides an online dashboard for assessing, at the international level, equity in climate action, inequalities in emissions, energy and resource consumption across the world, and ongoing climate policies of several countries. It has conceptualised and developed by independent researchers from India, according to an official statement“In keeping with the latest scientific results of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that have underlined the importance of cumulative emissions and carbon budgets, the analysis will be anchored in these two concepts. The equitable sharing of the global carbon budget is the fundamental equity principle that will underpin the assessments that will progressively appear on the website,” officials saidThe existing “tracking” websites on climate policies are based in the global North and routinely do not address the crucial aspects of equity and differentiation. Other websites, according to the researchers, bury the key issues in complexities that are not transparently dealt with.The website is expected to be a valuable tool for policy makers, public institutions, researchers, academics, students, and the general public from developing countries to keep equity and climate justice considerations clearly in view in their perspective. The website will also undergo constant upgradation with additional new material, including the addition of new areas such as climate finance, technology transfer and adaptation, they added.Top world leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, will attend the high-level segment on Monday and TuesdayIn days that follow issues on the agenda for decades will be discussed. Upset over the slow pace so far, environmental activists are expected to stage protests during the summit.Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change: “We stand at a pivotal point in history. Humanity faces several stark but clear choices. We either choose to achieve rapid and large-scale reductions of emissions to keep the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C— or we accept that humanity faces a bleak future on this planet”.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson: “Glasgow represents our best chance. Just as the G-20 shares a collective responsibility to act, so the solutions are in our hands. I hope countries will gather next week in a spirit of responsibility and ambition so we can keep the goal of 1.5 degrees alive”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cop26-begins-in-glasgow-indian-researchers-launch-tracking-website-to-debunk-the-narrative-provided-by-many-developed-countries-332465

31-10-2021||New Delhi||Criminal law should not be set in motion without proper probe: SC||Criminal law should not be set into motion without adequate investigation of facts on mere suspicion, the Supreme Court has said while quashing a criminal case against the director of a company.A bench of Justices RS Reddy and Sanjiv Khanna said vicarious liability is attracted when the offence is committed with the consent, connivance, or is attributable to the neglect on the part of a director, manager, secretary, or another officer of the company.In law, vicarious liability is the responsibility assigned to an employer, resulting from the actions of an employee.“Criminal law should not be set into motion as a matter of course or without adequate and necessary investigation of facts on mere suspicion, or when the violation of law is doubtful.“It is the duty and responsibility of the public officer to proceed responsibly and ascertain the true and correct facts. Execution of law without appropriate acquaintance with legal provisions and comprehensive sense of their application may result in an innocent being prosecuted,” the apex court said.On the issue of summon, the bench said it is the court’s duty not to issue summons in a mechanical and routine manner.“It is the duty of the magistrate to apply his mind to see whether on the basis of the allegations made and the evidence, a prima facie case for taking cognizance and summoning the accused is made out or not,” the bench said in its October 29 judgement said.The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by Dayle de Souza challenging an order of Madhya Pradesh, which dismissed his plea seeking quashing of the case against him.Resultantly, and for the reasons stated above, we would allow the present appeal and quash the summoning order and the proceedings against the present appellant.The petitioner, director of Writer Safeguard Pvt.

31-10-2021||New Delhi||India saw 31 children die by suicide every day in 2020; experts say Covid upped psychological trauma||An average 31 children died by suicide every day in India in 2020, according to government data, with experts underlining that the COVID-19 pandemic may have accentuated the psychological trauma faced by children to a great extent.According to the National Crime Records Bureau data, 11,396 children died by suicide in 2020, an 18 per cent rise from 9,613 such deaths in 2019 and 21 per cent rise from 9,413 in 2018.‘Family Problems’ (4,006), ‘Love Affairs’ (1,337) and ‘Illness’ (1,327) were the main causes of suicide among children (below 18 years of age). Ideological causes or hero worshipping, unemployment, bankruptcy, impotency or infertility and drug abuse were other reasons behind suicide by some children.Prabhat Kumar, Deputy Director – Child Protection, Save the Children, said COVID-19 and the resultant school closures and social isolation coupled with anxiety among elders have further aggravated the issue of mental health and brought it to the forefront.“While we as a society are cognisant of tangibles such as education and physical health for building national human capital, emotional wellbeing or psycho-social support often takes a back seat. The successively increasing number of suicides among children reflects a systemic failure. It is a collective responsibility of parents, families, neighbourhoods, and government at large to provide a conducive ecosystem where children can look forward to realizing their potential and fulfilling their dreams for a bright future.  Committing suicide, on the contrary, is an antithesis,” Kumar told PTI.“Stigma attached to mental health and an abysmally low number of per capita mental health professionals demand urgent attention. COVID-19, and the resultant school closures and social isolation coupled with anxiety among elders has further aggravated the issue and brought it to the forefront. Save the Children calls for a collective action to nurture an encouraging and supportive ecosystem for children and youth,” he added.Commenting on the topic, Priti Mahara, Director, Policy Research and Advocacy at CRY-Child Rights and You, said from the very beginning of the pandemic, it was one of the major concerns that it might impact children’s mental health and psycho-social well-being, and the recent NCRB data actually underscores the fear that the pandemic may have accentuated the psychological trauma faced by the children to a great extent.“As the NCRB data reveals, a total of 11,396 children (5,392 boys and 6,004 girls) have died by suicide in 2020, which accounts for 31 deaths per day or approximately 1 child committing suicide per hour,” she told PTI.“Children have gone through tremendous emotional stress and trauma due to home confinement and lack of interaction with friends, teachers or any other person in the position of trust due to prolonged closure of schools and limited social interactions,” she said.Many of them have been through hostile environment at home, many others have seen demise of their loved ones and have faced the impact of fear of contagion and deepening financial crisis at the family level, she said.Many children have also experienced huge uncertainty related to completion of curriculum, exams and results.“A huge number of children, especially the ones living under the shadows of multi-dimensional poverty, struggled with attending online classes and were majorly impacted by the digital divide, while many others suffered from over-exposure to internet and the social media and were subjected to online bullying and allied cyber-crimes,” she said.“All of these, compounded with an overall anxiety of the uncertainty of the future, must have been too much to bear for their young and tender minds,” she added.Akhila Sivadas, Executive Director, Centre For Advocacy and Research, said alternative care and counselling models have to be developed in collaboration with key stakeholders and every effort should be made to take the learnings to a cross-section of society so that everyone takes the responsibility to curb this practice.Mental health expert Prakriti Poddar, Managing Trustee at Poddar Foundation, said parents must understand how fragile their children’s mental well-being is and be proactive in assessing it.“Teachers also need to be trained in identifying symptoms and patterns of mental issues. Apart from that, educational institutions must have psychological counselling programmes in place to help students deal with their issues in confidentiality. Every child has a different coping mechanism. Therefore, the counselling programmes must be flexible, to cater to the needs of each child individually. If needed, a student must be referred to a mental healthcare professional for timely intervention,” Poddar said.

Yasmeen Wankhede (the NCB official’s sister) became Jasmine and she divorced her husband, who is a Muslim and is now settled in Europe,” the NCP leader said.Healso  took an objection to National Commission for Scheduled Castes vice chairman Arun Haldar’s statement that Wankhedes never converted.“Haldar may be a BJP leader, but he is appointed to a constitutional post. He should verify all facts of what information he has been given, prepare his report and submit it to Parliament, instead of coming before the media and commenting that Wankhede did not convert. A person who is not from a Scheduled Caste cannot claim benefits,” he said.“Sameer Wankhede never converted because he is a Muslim by birth. His father had converted and both children are born Muslims. I am not fighting a battle of caste and religion, but I am highlighting how a government job was obtained on bogus caste certificate,” Malik said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nawab-malik-stands-by-his-claim-asserts-sameer-wankhede-is-muslim-by-birth-332407

The police may put Nakas at the appropriate places to regulate the inflow of the supporters of the petitioner”, the court said in its order.Banerjee also shared a poster on his Facebook page, which said that “Badla Noy, Badal Chai (No revenge but want change), and appealed to party workers to attend his meeting.Amid a spike in coronavirus cases in parts of the country, the BJP-led state government had on Saturday issued fresh guidelines, making COVID-19 tests mandatory for people entering Tripura from several states, including West Bengal.The TMC had promptly reacted to it and called this a political move.“The BJP is scared of Abhishek. They are using coronavirus as a shield to stop him from addressing the people of Tripura. This shows they know well that the people of Tripura are no longer with the BJP,” TMC leader Partha Chatterjee had claimed.The TMC is trying to gain foothold in the northeastern state ahead of assembly elections in 2023.The party had on Saturday accused the Biplab Deb government in Tripura of making every effort to stop the party from expanding its base in the northeastern state, dubbing the move to make COVID-19 tests mandatory for certain travellers a tactic to stonewall its campaigns.Responding to the taunts, BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh had claimed that the TMC was trying to “import the politics of violence” in Tripura from Bengal.

We are now going to file an application before the NCB seeking permission to allow her to go Madhya Pradesh, as she hails from there." Her co-accused Arbaaz Merchant, who is lodged at the Arthur Road jail, is yet to be released.Aryan Khan case: NCB trying to get into media by targeting Bollywood, says lawyer representing Sushant Singh Rajput’s family Aryan Khan, who was also lodged in the Arthur Road jail following arrest in the case, returned home on Saturday. The HC had in its detailed order asked Aryan Khan, Merchant, and Dhamecha to appear before the NCB's Mumbai office every Friday between 11.00 am to 2.00 pm to mark their presence. On October 2, the NCB had raided the Goa-bound cruise ship off the Mumbai coast and claimed to have seized drugs onboard. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cruise-drugs-case-model-munmun-dhamecha-released-from-jail-332381
31-10-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Aryan Khan case: NCB trying to get into media by targeting Bollywood, says lawyer representing Sushant Singh Rajput’s family||The lawyer for the late actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s family in their legal wrangle with Rhea Chakraborty has accused the Narcotics Control Bureau of playing for public attention by taking up cases against Bollywood personalities, adding to the mounting criticism that the bureau is facing over an alleged drug racket involving Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan.Senior advocate Vikas Singh told NDTV that the bureau was only picking up such cases to hit the spotlight.“The NCB is very anxious to get into media,” an NDTV report quoted him as having said.“They are targeting small-time consumers and in Delhi, our children tell us drugs are being consumed by children at parties. If this is the standard of NCB, they should start raiding parties in Delhi as well where powerful people are there,” Singh told NDTV.   “It’s not fair for them to just pick up Bollywood (Hindi film industry based in Mumbai) and give Bollywood a bad name as if Bollywood is filled with drug addicts. That’s not the right attitude of the NCB. Instead of going for the big fish, they are just diverting the attention of people.”Cruise drugs case: Model Munmun Dhamecha released from jailIncidentally, actor Rhea Chakraborty, who was investigated in connection with Rajput’s suicide, was among those whose names the NCB took in its charge sheet before a special court in connection with Rajput’s death. The NCB had accused Chakroborty and her brother Showik of being part of a "drug syndicate" and claimed she was part of a conspiracy to procure and supply drugs.Aryan Khan walks out of prison after 22 daysSingh was Sushant Singh’s father KK Singh lawyer in his legal battle against actor Rhea Chakraborty over the Bollywood star’s death in June 2020. Rajput’s suicide set off a series of investigations into supposed drug links in the film industry, with the NCB questioning several industry personalities.Khan, son of Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, was arrested over WhatsApp chats that the NCB allegedly found in his phone during a raid on a luxury cruise in Mumbai on October 2. He was sent to Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail on October 8 and was released on bail on Saturday.  The Bombay High Court set 14 conditions for his bail, which includes surrendering his passport to investigators, reporting to the bureau every week, and not making any attempt to contact the other suspects in the case—including his friend Arbaaz Merchant and model Munmun Dhamecha. The NCB meanwhile has found no drugs on him but has instead pegged their entire investigation on WhatsApp chats that they prove his involvement in “illicit drug deals” and links with a foreign drugs cartel.In a related but equally mystifying development in the case, NCB Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede, an Indian Revenue Service officer of the 2008 batch who’s heading the investigations, now faces allegations of extortion and impropriety in the Aryan Khan case after a witness accused him of demanding payoffs in the case.  Wankhede has denied the allegations as “an attempt to derail investigations” and approached the Bombay High Court, which said authorities must give him three days' notice before taking any action against him.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aryan-khan-case-ncb-trying-to-get-into-media-by-targeting-bollywood-says-lawyer-representing-sushant-singh-rajputs-family-332380
31-10-2021||Kevadia (Gujarat)||India becoming fully capable of dealing with all external, internal challenges: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said India is becoming fully capable of dealing with all kinds of external and internal challenges, while deriving inspiration from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.In a video message on the occasion of ‘Rashtriya Ekta Diwas’, the birth anniversary of the country’s first deputy prime minister and home minister Sardar Patel, Modi said collective efforts, like those seen during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, will take the country to new heights.Noting that the nation is paying tribute to Sardar Patel who gave his life for ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshth Bharat’, Modi said Patel lives not only in history but also in the hearts of all Indians.“Sardar Patel always wanted India to be strong, inclusive, sensitive and alert, humble and developed. He always put the interest of the country first. Today, deriving inspiration from him, India is becoming fully capable of dealing with all kinds of challenges, external and internal,” Modi said.He said the country is today taking inspiration from the spirit of ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’ to achieve self-reliance and safeguard its interests.“In the last seven years, the country has got rid of the decades-old unwanted laws, and has taken the ideals that cherish national unity to new heights. Be it Jammu and Kashmir, North East or any village in the Himalayas, today all are progressing on the path of progress,” he said.The prime minister said the modern infrastructure development in the country is working to remove the geographical and cultural distances.The country is today witnessing a “great maha yagna of social, economic and constitutional integration”, and its capability and determination on every front - water, land, air, space - is unprecedented, he said.“India has started on a new mission of self-reliance to safeguard its interests,” Modi said.He said the spirit of everyone’s effort should be made the basis of the pace of development and to make a self-reliant India.“Where the lack of unity brings new crisis, the collective effort of everyone takes the country to new heights,” he said.He cited the fight against coronavirus as an example of what the country can achieve through collective efforts.“From new COVID-19 hospitals to ventilators, from manufacturing essential medicines to crossing the milestone of 100 crore vaccine doses—these have been made possible only because of the efforts of every Indian, every government, every industry,” he said.Modi said the combined result of several reforms undertaken over the years has made India an attractive investment destination. “We now have to make this spirit of everyone’s effort the basis of the pace of development, to make a self-reliant India,” he said.He said every action should be taken with “broader national goals” in mind and to see how one is supporting it in a self-reliant India. “Indian industry can also set targets of how much it needs to depend on foreign raw materials or components,” he said.He said farmers can also strengthen their participation in self-reliant India by adopting new farming techniques and new crops (cultivation), according to the needs of the country.“Our cooperative institutions should also strengthen small farmers of the country. The more we focus on our small farmers, the more we come forward for their betterment. We will be able to create a new trust even in remote villages and we will have to do this,” he said.Modi also said everybody will have to contribute to enrich the spirit of ‘One India’, and “only when we remain united will we be able to move forward, and only then will the country achieve its goals.”  The form of today’s India, as per Sardar Patel’s idea, should be one where women have equal opportunity, where the Dalits, deprived sections, tribals and forest dwellers, every citizen of the country feels equal.He said the country is today working in the direction of achieving the same kind of India, where there is no discrimination in facilities like house, electricity, water, and setting new goals regularly.“If the dynamism of the society is added to the government, it is not difficult to achieve the biggest of resolutions, everything is possible,” he said.These things may seem ordinary, but their results will be unprecedented. Over the years, we have seen how people’s participation has strengthened the country even in small matters like cleanliness, he said.“As a citizen, when we moved ahead as one India, we also got success and we also contributed to the excellence of India. You always remember- even the smallest work is great if there is a good spirit behind it. The joy that is there in serving the country cannot be described in words,” he said.“For the integrity and unity of the country, while fulfilling our civic duties, our every effort is a true tribute to Sardar Patelji. Taking inspiration from our accomplishments, let us move forward, give new heights to the unity and excellence of the country,” he added.

31-10-2021||New York||Jaishankar, Blinken meet in Rome, discuss ‘important regional concerns’||India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met in Rome to discuss broadening strategic cooperation across the world as the two democracies are raising their relations to new levels.They discussed "efforts to deepen the US-India Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership" during their meeting on Saturday on the sidelines of the 16th G20 Summit, according to State Department Spokesperson Ned Price.New Delhi and Washington have turned to the other side of the Indian Ocean that India straddles after firming up cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region multilaterally with the Quad – the grouping of their countries and Australia and Japan.Earlier this month, Jaishankar and Blinken held a virtual meeting with Foreign Ministers Yair Lapid of Israel and Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) -- four countries that share many regional strategic interests -- and discussed "future opportunities for collaboration in the region and globally", according to the State Department.Jaishankar tweeted after the Rome meeting that they had a "good meeting" and "discussed a wide gamut of issues relating to our partnership. Updated each other on important regional concerns".Price said that efforts to strengthen cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region through the Quad and common regional priorities were also discussed.Expanding global access to vaccines was another topic they discussed given India's position as the world's largest producer of vaccines, he said.India is the linchpin in the Quad's initiative to supply 1.2 billion vaccines that was reiterated at the summit of the leaders of the four countries last month in Washington.Prime Ministers Narendra Modi of India and Scott Morrison of Australia, US President Joe Biden and the then-Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced at their summit that their Vaccine Partnership was on track to expand the capacity of India's Biological E Ltd to produce at least 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of next year.Price's readout of the meeting between Jaishankar and Blinken also contained the obligatory reference to democracy, which some in India and in the US would latch on to giving it deeper meanings.It said they discussed "reinforcing their mutual commitments to and support for shared democratic values".However, despite Biden's statements making his administration the global beacon of democracy, such references to democracy are missing in readouts of Blinken's meetings with leaders of most countries, especially those that are not democratic.For example, references to democracy were left out of the India, US, Israel and UAE meeting, likely in deference to the Gulf nation.It didn't figure in the readout of his recent meetings with Qatar Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani or Zayed or Saudi Foreign Ministers Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.Blinken and Jaishankar have been in close contact through phone calls and virtual meetings and have met in London in May, in Washington also in May and in New Delhi in July.They are expected to meet again this year in Washington along with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin for the 2+2 ministerial meeting of the defence and foreign policy heads of the two nations.

It should tell the people of the state,” he said, adding it was the PM’s vision for the reconstruction of Kedarnath (which suffered extensive damage in 2013) that led to unprecedented development in and around the temple.Shah credited former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee for the creation of the state and asked people to give another opportunity to the Modi-Dhami team.Warning that a wrong decision could lead to a “corrupt government” coming to power, he spoke about former CM Harish Rawat’s sting video showing him negotiating a deal to buy support of rebel MLAs and the ‘Dennis liquor scam’ during his tenure. Claiming the Congress believed in “appeasement”, Shah also recalled how “Muslims were allowed to offer namaz in the middle of highways on Fridays” during its rule.He also launched schemes for the state, including the CM Ghasyari Kalyan Yojana, which will help women from travelling long distances to fetch fodder.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-uttarakhand-amit-shah-sounds-poll-bugle-seeks-another-bjp-term-332195
31-10-2021||---||Will keep poll promises: Rahul Gandhi in Goa||New Delhi, October 30The Congress on Saturday launched its poll campaign from Goa with party leader Rahul Gandhi saying he would keep all manifesto promises and was not like others.“I am not here to waste your time or mine. Like your time is important, my time is also important. The commitment we make to you in our Goa election manifesto will not just be a commitment. It will be a guarantee,” Rahul said addressing fishermen in South Goa during his daylong trip to the state.Rahul’s visit comes parallel to that of Trinamool Congress leader and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who attacked the grand old party today for strengthening the BJP by refusing to forge opposition unity.While Banerjee is in Goa to attempt an alliance with the Goa Forward Party, the Congress has not responded positively to the overtures of the Vijay Sardesai-led outfit.Rahul in his remarks today steered clear of personal and political attacks on the opposition sufficing to say that the Congress meant business.Besides pledging to treat party poll promises as guarantees, Rahul also said the Congress spread affection and love and believed in taking the country forward, whereas the ruling BJP worked to divide people.“Let me make the difference between the Congress and BJP clear. The Congress believes in uniting people and taking them forward. For us, every citizen of India has the right to the space and freedom they deserve and need. Wherever the BJP spreads hatred we spread love,” he said, days after the Congress demanded the sacking of Chief Minister Pramod Sawant and dismissal of his Cabinet over recent accusations of former Goa governor Satya Pal Malik that the state government indulged in corruption during Covid times. Rahul today promised the fishermen to work to prevent a coal hub from coming up in the area.“If I say to you that we will not allow a coal hub and then I do not deliver, I will lose my credibility,” he said standing in solidarity with the fishermen who are against a project of double tracking of the South Western Railway which, they say, would convert the state into a coal hub.He also cited Congress poll promises including that of a farm loan waiver in party-ruled Chhattisgarh saying the same had been delivered. He said Congress governments always keep their commitments. The Congress strength in the Goa Assembly was reduced to four with the recent defection of former state chief minister Luizinho Faleiro to the TMC.The Congress was the single largest party in the 2017 state polls with 17 MLAs in a house of 40, but its decline was rapid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-keep-poll-promises-rahul-gandhi-in-goa-332196

However, it is clear that the earlier affidavit went against the categorical stand taken by the Centre, which said they were a security threat to the country and had no fundamental right to stay in India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-takes-u-turn-on-deportation-of-rohingyas-332201

The same cohort was re-simulated, hypothetically assuming that they did not have diabetes.The total difference between the two cohorts, in terms of excess deaths, years of life lost (YLL), productivity-adjusted life years (PALYs) lost reflected the impact of diabetes. Data regarding the prevalence of diabetes, mortality, labour force dropouts and productivity loss attributable to diabetes were derived from published sources.The results state that in 2017, an estimated 54.4 million (7.6 per cent) people of working-age in India had diabetes.

After the explosion, we immediately cordoned off the area with the help of neutral central forces and started an investigation," the Hailakandi SP said.On Friday morning, an Indian Reserve Battalion (IRBn) official of the Mizoram Police was found loitering in the area and he could not explain his presence there, Upadhyay said."We picked him up and during interrogation, we found his involvement in the blast.

Speaking at the G-20 Summit’s inaugural session on economy and Covid in Rome on Saturday, he touched on India’s economic reforms and its willingness to adopt a common global tax on corporations to urge the world’s top 20 economies, accounting for 80 per cent of the global GDP, to view India as their prime investment destination. The PM said emergency use authorisation (EUA) to India’s Covaxin vaccine by the World Health Organisation (WHO) would help facilitate the “process of expedited vaccination.”He said India was ready to produce over 5 billion Covid vaccine doses by the end of next year to help the world fight the pandemic.At the first in-person confabulations in two years, the G-20 Summit discussed the need for supplying vaccines to poorer countries and giving them a further extension on debt relief, said Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla. The conference was opened by Italian PM Mario Draghi, who termed the global vaccine gap as “morally unacceptable” because global growth would remain behind due to low vaccinations. The Prime Minister held several bilateral meetings as well as pull-asides on the margins of the conference. He briefly interacted with outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel and had pull-asides with US President Joe Biden, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, French President Emmanuel Macron, UK PM Boris Johnson and Canada’s PM Justin Trudeau.“We were not present when the PM met Biden. They would have recalled their last meeting in September. The PM accepted Biden’s side meeting on Sunday,’’ said Shringla. While the G-20 seemed to speak in one voice on vaccine equity, cracks appeared on the issue of climate change. “There are two more sessions,’’ said Shringla, indicating that there was adequate time for a consensus on the issue.There were expectations that all G-20 countries would make new commitments ahead of the UN climate conference (COP26) that begins in Glasgow, Scotland, on Sunday. Most of the G-20 attendees will head for Glasgow but for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.On Sunday, the G-20 may take up an issue that has hit economies hard —the imbalance in supply and demand in the global energy markets. Leaders would underscore the need for greater stability in oil and gas markets as the global economy has already been badly bruised by the pandemic.Hour-long meeting with pope francisPM Modi on Saturday met Pope Francis at the Vatican and gifted him a silver candlestick and a book.

Amid a growing number of extreme climate events, there is tremendous pressure on developing nations like India to revise nationally determined commitments (NDCs), cut-off coal/fossil fuels, and declare a Net Zero target.But with per capita carbon emissions per year “far less than countries like the USA, EU, and China”, India’s stance is that it is doing what is required to tackle climate change and is willing to contribute “constructively” to further efforts. But “fossil fuels are essential for its growth plans and targets” and “what is happening today is due to historic actions of developed nations”. India’s INDC pitch includes approximately 450-Gigawatt renewable energy by 2030, and other mitigation efforts. Indian negotiators are expected to move to establish a mechanism for ‘loss and damage’ due to climate change-related events and compensating regions most vulnerable and help them prevent and manage mishaps in the future.According to reports, Britain hopes the summit will adopt plans to help move closer to the target of limiting the rise in the average global temperature to 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.While the Paris Agreement of 2015 pledged to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the world has already warmed by 1.1°C since then.CSE’s Sunita Narain says even enhanced NDCs are not nearly enough to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C.“Many poor countries, with low annual emissions, have pledged higher targets than rich countries, which is a mockery of the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and a human rights concern,” she says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cop-26-kicks-off-on-october-31-climate-technology-finance-to-be-indias-main-focus-332034

I had the opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues with him and also invited him to visit India,” Modi tweeted after the historic meeting.Pope Francis received Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a private audience at the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a press release.This was the first meeting between an Indian Prime Minister and the Pope in more than two decades. In June 2000, late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had last visited the Vatican and met the then Pope, His Holiness John Paul II.India and The Holy See have friendly relations dating back to the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1948. India is home to the second largest Catholic population in Asia, the release said.During the meeting, the two leaders discussed the Covid-19 pandemic and its consequences for people across the world. They also discussed the challenge posed by climate change, it said.The Prime Minister, who is in Italy to attend the G20 Summit, briefed the Pope about the ambitious initiatives taken by India in combating climate change as well as India’s success in administering one billion Covid-19 vaccination doses. Prime Minister Modi will also attend the Climate Summit to be held in Glasgow from Sunday.His Holiness appreciated India’s assistance to countries in need during the pandemic, the release said.Prime Minster extended an invitation to Pope Francis to visit India at an early date, which was accepted with pleasure, it said.The last Papal Visit happened in 1999 when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Prime Minister and Pope John Paul II came. Now it is during Modi’s prime ministerial term that the Pope has been invited to visit India, sources said.The meeting between Prime Minister Modi and Pope Francis that was scheduled only for 20 minutes went on for an hour, they said.They discussed a wide range of issues aimed at making the planet better by fighting climate change and removing poverty, sources said.“During a brief conversation, the cordial relations between the Holy See and India were discussed,” the Vatican Press Office said in a brief statement on the meeting between the Pope and Prime Minister Modi.Subsequently, in the Secretariat of State, Prime Minister Modi greeted Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin and Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, Security of Relations with States, it added.At the Vatican, Modi was accompanied by National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.Ahead of the historic meeting, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Friday said that the Vatican has not set an agenda for the meeting. “I believe, tradition is not to have an agenda when you discuss issues with His Holiness. And I think we would respect that,” he had said.“I am sure the issues would cover a range of areas of interest in terms of the general global perspectives and issues that are important to all of us, COVID-19, health issues, how we can work together to maintain peace and tranquility and this is something that, I think would be the general trend in the discussions,” he had added.

Modiji is going to be more powerful because of the Congress...If one cannot take decision, why the country should suffer for that?" she said."They (Congress) got opportunity (in the past). Instead of fighting against the BJP, they contested against me in my state. Don't you think when they contested against me, when they contest my political party in Bengal...,” she said.Banerjee said the TMC believes in distributing seats for the regional parties in elections. The TMC has announced that it will be contesting on all 40 seats in the upcoming Goa elections."I want that the regional parties should be strong. We want that the federal structure should be strong. We should make states strong. If states are strong, then the Centre will be strong. Delhi ka dadagiri amka naka (We don't want Delhi's bullying), enough is enough," she said.When asked about what decisions she thinks the Congress should be taking, she said, "I am not going to discuss about the Congress because this is not my party.

31-10-2021||Mumbai||Aryan Khan back home after 22 days in Mumbai prison||Aryan Khan had an emotional reunion with parents Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan on Saturday as he returned home from Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail after spending 22 days there following his arrest in a Narcotics Control Bureau raid on a cruise ship off the city coast.The 23-year-old son of the Bollywood superstar walked out of the prison at 11 am, got into a car, and reached home Mannat, a landmark in surburban Bandra half an hour later, as fans waited outside the landmark bungalow to catch a glimpse.READIt was the homecoming of their “prince” Aryan Khan and fans of Shah Rukh Khan made sure to make it special as they thronged in larger numbers outside the actor’s bungalow, celebrating with music, dance, and firecrackers.As Shah Rukh’s convoy arrived at Mannat, hundreds of fans of the actor gathered to catch a glimpse of the Khan family. The supporters ran alongside the car, shouting, “We love Shah Rukh, we love Aryan” and started dancing to the beats of drums.Police barricaded the area outside Mannat to control the crowd and the media contingent present.“Welcome home Aryan Khan. Stay strong prince Aryan. Everything will be alright soon,” read a banner by a group of fans who arrived outside Mannat early in the morning.“Today we are standing outside Mannat and we finally feel like jannat (heaven). It was a tough time. But Shah Rukh and the family have sailed through it,” a fan said.Fans across ages, children, college students. and even elderly couples showed up to celebrate Aryan’s return to his home. The lane to Mannat’s entrance was jam-packed with crowds. Police and Shah Rukh’s private security had to clear the area for the car to move smoothly.Even after Aryan’s convoy went inside the bungalow, many fans waited in the hope that Shah Rukh might wave to the eager supporters, as he does annually on his birthday.On Friday evening, Mannat was decked up with lights, signaling the celebrations for his release, Shah Rukh’s birthday on November 2, Diwali on November 4, and then Aryan’s birthday on November 13.Earlier in the morning, half an hour before Aryan came out of the prison, his father’s bodyguard got down from a white Range Rover car near the jail gate. Around 11 am, the car started moving slowly near the prison’s gate and stopped to receive Aryan.The Range Rover was part of the convoy which left Mannat shortly after 8 am and reached a spot near the prison around 9 am, where it halted to avoid a traffic jam in the area, an official said.A large crowd of Shah Rukh Khan’s fans had gathered outside the prison since early morning. A sizeable media contingent was also present to cover Aryan’s release from the jail.Outside the prison, fans and onlookers cheering for Shah Rukh Khan and Aryan and trying to catch a glimpse of the superstar were in for a disappointment as they could not see the actor’s face and had to assume that he was in the vehicle.Aryan came out of the prison a day after a special court issued his release memo.He was granted bail by the Bombay High Court on Thursday. Shah Rukh Khan’s actor-friend Juhi Chawla stood as surety for the 23-year-old before the special court, designated to hear cases related to the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS).The high court on Friday afternoon made available its operative order in which it imposed 14 bail conditions on Aryan Khan and his co-accused in the case, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha, who were also granted bail, stipulating their release on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh each with one or two sureties of the same amount.The relief to the trio came just a day before the high court was scheduled to take a two-week break for Diwali.In the five-page order, the high court said the trio will have to surrender their passports before the NDPS court and shall not leave India without taking permission from the special court and will have to attend the NCB office each Friday between 11 am and 2 pm to mark their presence.The judge will give a detailed bail order with reasons next week.Aryan Khan, Merchant, and Dhamecha were arrested by the NCB on October 3 and booked under relevant sections of the NDPS Act for possession, consumption, sale/purchase of banned drugs, and conspiracy and abetment.Meanwhile, a special court in Mumbai on Saturday granted bail to alleged drug peddler Aachit Kumar and eight others who were arrested by the NCB following the raid on the cruise ship. Of the 20 persons arrested by the NCB after the raid, 14 have got bail so far. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aryan-khan-back-home-after-22-days-in-mumbai-prison-331963
