12-10-2021||---||There was a concerted effort to defame Savarkar after Independence: RSS chief Bhagwat||New Delhi, October 12Praising the Narendra Modi government, Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday said it was only after 2014 that India’s security policy started getting priority in the government’ agenda. The RSS chief, while speaking at an event to launch a book on Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, ‘Veer Savarkar: The Man Who Could Have Prevented Partition’ by Uday Mahurkar, also said a major gameplan was carried out after the Independence to “to defame the Sangh Parivar and Veer Savarkar”, which failed.Describing Savarkar as a true nationalist, the RSS chief said all his predictions are coming true today. Due to lack of information about Savarkar, there was a concerted effort to defame him after Independence and the next target could be Swami Vivekananda, Swami Dayanand Saraswati and Maharishi Arvind, he also warned.Bhagwat said the campaign of defamation will also be launched against the likes of Swami Vivekananda, Swami Dayanand Saraswati and Yogi Arvind, because Veer Savarkar was very much influenced by their ideas.“Savarkar’s Hindutva, Vivekananda’s Hindutva... it has become a fashion to say so. Hindutva is one, which it is from the beginning and will remain till the end. The one who lives in India belongs to India and his security and prestige are related to India’s,” the RSS chief said, again reiterated that ancestors of all those living in India, irrespective of their caste and creed, were the same.There are many nationalist Muslims who too should be celebrated, he added. All the people living in India are Hindus, Bhagwat said, advising people of all faiths to live together.Objecting to the use of the word minority, the RSS chief said there is no such thing as minority. “We are all one, we are the inheritors of the same culture, in spite of differing rituals and languages. Everyone has equal rights, and also duties,” he added. Describing Savarkar as a true nationalist, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said people of a particular ideology has spread “misconceptions” about him- “a great hero of the Indian freedom struggle”.Rajnath Singh said a lie was spread about Savarkar that he had apologised to the British, whereas the truth was that the petition was filed as a legal right at the behest of Mahatma Gandhi so that he could come out of jail and join the freedom movement. “It is difficult to put down in words everything that Veer Savarkar had done for this country,” Rajnath Singh said, adding: “He was a true nationalist, nothing else.”According to Uday Mahurkar, the author of the book, Savarkar is the “father of India’s national security” and that his nationalist ideology was “sacrificed at the altar of vote bank politics”.RSS’ VijayadashamiKeeping in mind Covid protocols, the RSS has decided not to invite any guest for the annual Vijayadashami address by the Sarsanghchalak for the second consecutive year.  However, with the situation being better, as many as 500 swayamsevaks are expected to attend the function which in the past has seen several prominent personalities, including late President Pranab Mukherjee, HCL chief Shiv Nadar and Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/there-was-a-concerted-effort-to-defame-savarkar-after-independence-rss-chief-bhagwat-323668

I mean India came out of a very, very tough second wave and that led to a big downgrade in July but we have no change (in its growth rate projections) as of now,” Gita Gopinath, Chief Economist of the IMF, told reporters during a virtual conference call on Tuesday.India’s growth projection released by the latest World Economic Outlook remains unchanged from its previous WEO update of July this summer but is a three-percentage point in 2021 and 1.6 percentage point drop from its April projections.According to the latest WEO update, released ahead of the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank, India’s economy which contracted by 7.3 per cent a year due to Covid-19 pandemic is expected to grow by 9.5 per cent in 2021 and 8.5 per cent in 2022.The world is expected to grow at 5.9 per cent in 2021 and 4.9 per cent in 2022. The United States is projected to grow at six per cent this year and 5.2 per cent the next year. China, on the other hand, the IMF said, is projected to grow at 8 per cent in 2021 and 5.6 per cent in 2022.Gopinath said there are many challenges that the Indian economy already faces with regard to the financial market, with regard to the fact that the virus is not gone yet.“The Indians are doing well in terms of vaccination rates and that’s certainly helpful,” Gopinath said in response to a question.Malhar Nabar, who heads the World Economic Studies division in the IMF’s Research Department that produces the World Economic Outlook (WEO), said that there is still room to provide more support if needed if the pandemic takes a turn for the worse, to provide it in a targeted manner to the worst affected households and firms.“But going forward over the medium term, it was important to put in place a credible medium-term strategy to bring down the debt to GDP ratio, and create space to meet the future development needs and infrastructure needs of the Indian economy,” Nabar said in response to a question. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-doing-well-in-terms-of-vaccinating-its-own-people-says-imf-official-323662

The family alerted the police and immediately three police teams were formed while special operation group (SOG) and surveillance teams were also roped in,” Jaiswal said.“The teams went cracking immediately considering the sensitivity of the case. Raids were conducted and checks set up on the basis of technical and manual inputs because of which we were able to track the car within three hours,” he said.All three accused were arrested from the spot and the elderly woman rescued safely, the district police chief said, adding that she went back home after a medical examination.Those arrested have been identified as Saurabh Agarwal, a native of Aligarh, Rishi Sharma and Nitin Singh, both Hathras residents, said Jaiswal, who has announced a reward of Rs 25,000 for officials involved in the successful rescue operation.According to police, Agarwal runs a kirana shop in Aligarh and wanted to make a lot of money quickly. “He also has a girlfriend because of which his expenditures cross his limits,” they said.“Agarwal wanted to make a lot of money and buy a house for himself. He would watch ‘Crime Patrol’ (a dramatised TV show based on real-life crime cases) and got the kidnapping idea from it. In order to implement the plan, he lured his two friends Sharma and Singh also, saying they could all make a lot of money in a short time,” the police said.Agarwal had come to Hathras last week where he spotted the elderly woman going to the Bhagwat Katha and followed her. He also went to the venue where on some pretext, he introduced himself to the woman and also got to know about her background, the police said.“On Monday, he again went to the place, and in a friendly manner told her that his mother wanted to meet her. He tricked her into going with him to meet his mother but abducted her in the car with the other accused waiting outside the venue,” it said.An FIR has been lodged against the trio at Kotwali Nagar Hathras police station. Two illegal firearms along with some ammunition were seized from their possession and the car used in the crime has been impounded, the police said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tv-show-inspired-men-abduct-senior-citizen-for-ransom-uttar-pradesh-cops-bust-plot-in-3-hours-323656
12-10-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi for united response to check terrorism, tackle humanitarian crises in Afghanistan||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday called for a united response from the global community to the crises in Afghanistan in order to preserve the socio-economic gains of the last 20 years in infrastructure development, woman empowerment, education and health.The PM wanted the united response towards the humanitarian crises in Afghanistan to be in tandem with steps to restrict the spread of radical ideology and an inclusive administration.Without a unified response, the PM warned that it would be difficult to bring about the desired change in Afghanistan’s situation.Speaking at an extraordinary G-20 Virtual Summit on Afghanistan where UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres complained that the international community was “moving too slowly” to prevent Afghanistan’s economic collapse, PM Modi agreed that Afghanistan must have immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance.But he pitched for a central role for the United Nations in providing humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan as per UN Security Council Resolution 2593 on Afghanistan, he added.This resolution is a bone of contention in the UNSC as Russia and China abstained from the Resolution, demanding that the aid should be routed through the dispensation in Kabul, the Taliban.While stating that every Indian feels the pain of Afghan people facing hunger and malnutrition, the PM also underlined the need to ensure that Afghan territory does not become a source of radicalisation and terrorism, regionally or globally.He emphasised on the need to enhance the joint fight against the “nexus of radicalisation, terrorism and the smuggling of drugs and arms in the region”.The meeting was convened by Italy, which currently holds the G20 Presidency, and chaired by the Italian PM Mario Draghi. The issues under consideration related to the humanitarian situation, concerns relating to terrorism and human rights in Afghanistan.PM Modi also mentioned that over the last two decades, India has contributed to promoting socio-economic development and capacity building of youth and women in Afghanistan. He recalled that over 500 development projects have been implemented by India in Afghanistan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-for-united-response-to-check-terrorism-tackle-humanitarian-crises-in-afghanistan-323653
12-10-2021||New Delhi||PMO reviews coal supply, power availability situation||Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on Tuesday reviewed the coal supply and power generation scenario as the government looks at ways to defuse the energy crisis being faced by several states.At the meeting over coal shortage at power plants which have led to blackouts in some states, Power Secretary Alok Kumar and Coal Secretary AK Jain made a presentation on coal and power availability, sources said, adding that ways to increase transportation of coal were also discussed during the meeting.The coal ministry has been asked to ramp up the supply of coal while railways has been asked to make available rakes to transport the fuel to power plants, the sources said.The shortage of coal--- which makes up around 70 per cent of India's electricity mix---has forced rotational power cuts in states from Rajasthan to Kerala.About two-thirds of the coal-fired power plants had stockpiles of a week or less but the coal ministry said, "any fear of disruption in the power supply is entirely misplaced". States have been forced to buy power from exchanges at high rates to meet demand.To defuse the crisis, the Union power ministry has issued instructions ranging from asking states not to sell power at high prices on the exchange to ordering state electricity generators to ensure adequate supplies.State-owned Coal India Ltd (CIL) has been asked to augment the coal supply to power producers to 1.55-1.6 million tonnes per day this week and to further scale it up to 1.7 million tonnes daily after October 20.The coal dispatched by CIL to the power sector on Monday stood at 1.615 million tonnes.Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi said the government is making full efforts to meet the coal demand of power producers. "We at the ministry and CIL are making full efforts to meet the coal demand... Yesterday (Monday), we supplied around 1.95 million tonnes of coal. Around 1.6 million tonnes from CIL and the remaining from Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. All put together, 1.95 million tonnes we have supplied".Speaking at the launch event of the third tranche of the auction for commercial mining of coal, the minister said, "from October 20-21 or before that, we will try to reach two million tonnes (supply), which will again be a record".  CIL has around 22 days of stock and supplies will be ramped up as monsoon rains in coal belt that led to the flooding of mines have receded.Responding to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's warning of a potential power crisis in the national capital, state-owned NTPC tweeted saying that distribution companies in Delhi were taking only 70 per cent of the power that it was made available to them.Tweeting a 10-day graph of electricity made available to distribution companies, it said, "NTPC has been making available required power for Delhi. As the data shows (1st October to 11th October), Delhi DISCOMs have been scheduling only 70% of the power that has been made available by NTPC." Against 54.83 million units made available, Delhi discoms scheduled only 38.81 million units on October 11, it said.Earlier in the day, the power ministry asked states to utilise unallocated power of the Central Generating Stations (CGS) to meet the requirements of their own consumers. "It has been brought to the notice of the Ministry of Power that some states are not supplying power to their consumers and imposing load shedding. At the same time, they are also selling power in the power exchange at high price," a power ministry statement said.As per the guidelines for allocation of power, 15 per cent of power from CGS is kept as "unallocated power" which is allocated by the central government to needy states to meet the requirement of power of the consumers.The responsibility to supply power to the consumers is of the distribution companies and they should first serve their consumers who have the right to receive 24x7 power. Thus, the distribution companies should not sell the power in the power exchange and starve their own consumers, it stated. In case any state is found to be not serving their consumers and selling power in the power exchanges at a higher rate, the unallocated power of such states shall be withdrawn and allocated to other needy states, the statement said.It also asked NTPC and DVC (Damodar Valley Corporation) to supply as much power as available to Delhi discoms under their respective power purchase agreements. In a fact sheet on the power supply situation in Delhi, the ministry stated that the maximum demand of Delhi was 4,536 MW (peak) and 96.2 MU (energy) on October 10, 2021. As per the information received from the Delhi discoms, there was no outage on account of power shortage as the required amount of power was supplied to them, it stated.  It also showed that there was no energy deficit in Delhi during the two-week period till October 10, 2021. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pmo-reviews-coal-supply-power-availability-situation-323651

12-10-2021||Noida (UP)||Over 1,200 booked over protest in UP’s Noida||An FIR was lodged on Tuesday against 1,200 to 1,500 protesters, including women, who have been charged with murder attempt, rioting, wrongful confinement, destruction of public property, among others, during an ongoing protest outside Noida Authority office here, officials said.Around “1,200 to 1,500” accused people have been booked in the case and the FIR names 31 individuals that includes Bhartiya Kisan Parishad leader Sukhvir Khaleefa alias Sukhvir Pahalwan.Hundreds of people from several villages in Noida have been protesting for over 40 days against the local authority with various demands, including hiked compensation for their land acquired by the government in the past.The protest is not part of the ongoing anti-farm law stir against the Centre on Delhi’s borders since November last year.According to police officials, the protesters led by farmer leader Khaleefa had locked the main gate of Noida Authority office in Sector 6 on Monday and also attacked police personnel who were deployed at the site.“The protesters started a march from the Baraat Ghar in Harola towards the Noida Authority office in the afternoon, raising slogans and hurling abuses against the officials. Their march also disrupted traffic movement on the busy road,” a police official on law and order duty claimed.“Those leading the march paid no heed to police’s announcements and efforts to pacify them and instructed the protesters to break past the barricades that were set up to control the crowd,” the official from the local Sector 20 police station said.Several policemen were injured in the clash that ensued and later the protestors locked up the main gate of Noida Authority office, disturbing government work also, according to the official.The first information report (FIR) was lodged around 2 am on Tuesday at the Sector 20 police station in connection with the episode and on basis of a complaint by the police personnel.The accused have been booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 342 (wrongful confinement), 341 (wrongful restraint), 332 (causing hurt to public servant in discharge of their duty), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 427 (mischief), 504 (intentional insult) and 147 (rioting), according to officials.They have also been charged with IPC Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (unlawfully or negligently spreading infection of any disease dangerous to life), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life).Sections under the Epidemic Diseases Act, Criminal Law Amendment Act, and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act have also been invoked in the case, the officials said.

12-10-2021||---||India calls for waiver of IPR and dismantling new trade barriers in the global fight against the pandemic||New Delhi, October 12Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday called for a waiver of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and dismantling new trade barriers in the global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.“Our response to the pandemic needs to ensure equitable access to vaccines and other Covid-19 related health products by ensuring quick resolution of the supply side constraints. One of the ways to demonstrate this is by accepting the TRIPS waiver proposal,” Goyal said in his address to the G20 Trade and Investment Ministerial Meeting in Naples, Italy.Goyal called for actively resolving new trade barriers like vaccine differentiations or Covid passports, which impose mobility restrictions and impede the movement of personnel needed for delivering critical services.“Covid-19 crisis is a powerful reminder of our interconnectedness, and the need for a coordinated global strategy to overcome such an unprecedented public health situation,” he said.He also underlined the need for an early universal vaccination against Covid-19.“Apart from focusing on facilitating free flow of goods, I invite G20 countries to join in efforts to make health services accessible and more affordable by the citizens of the world by enabling free flow of health services,” he said.“Our telemedicine initiative “e-Sanjeevani” has been serving millions of Indians. I am happy to offer it to the entire world,” he added.Commenting on the ongoing talks in WTO about fisheries subsidies, Goyal said countries engaged in distant water fishing should stop subsidizing their fishing in high seas and gradually reduce their fishing capacities, particularly, for overfished stocks.“To achieve balanced outcomes in fisheries subsidies, policy space for the future is a must, not only to protect the livelihoods of poor and marginal fishermen and address the food security concerns but also to diversify, modernise and develop the fisheries sector,” he said.Goyal said India is committed towards the United Nations 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).“India is among the few countries which is on track to exceed its commitments as per the Paris Agreement. We urge the Members to fulfil their commitments regarding transfer of technology and climate finance, which are far from being fulfilled by the developed countries,” he said.“Sustainability cannot be seen in isolation and has to be linked to making available grant based, long tenure, low cost and concessional and affordable technologies. India has consistently maintained that environmental/sustainability measures need careful assessment to ensure that they do not become new trade barriers and the right forum for them is the dedicated Multilateral Environmental Agreements,” he said.On the sidelines of the G20 Trade Ministers Meeting, the minister held bilateral meetings with the Director General of the WTO, US, UK, EU, Brazil, China, Australia, South Africa, Indonesia, Canada, South Korea and Mexico. “Historical wrongs against developing countries must be corrected rather than being carried over,” he said.In his meetings with the Canadian minister, he discussed steps to take forward the free trade agreement negotiations with the newly elected government while he called upon his South Korean and EU counterparts to accelerate review of the FTA.In October 2020, India and South Africa had submitted the first proposal, suggesting a waiver for all WTO members on the implementation of certain provisions of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) Agreement in relation to the prevention, containment or treatment of COVID-19.In May this year, a revised proposal was submitted by 62 co-sponsors, including India, South Africa, and Indonesia.The agreement on TRIP came into effect in January 1995. It is a multilateral agreement on intellectual property (IP) rights such as copyright, industrial designs, patents and protection of undisclosed information or trade secrets.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-calls-for-waiver-of-ipr-and-dismantling-new-trade-barriers-in-the-global-fight-against-the-pandemic-323638

Accusing them of “selective outrage”, the BJP spokesperson cited alleged incidents of atrocities against members of SC communities in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Jharkhand to claim that those who “project themselves as champions of Dalit rights ignore such incidents in non-BJP ruled states”.Speaking to media persons, Patra questioned: “Both Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra project themselves as champions of Dalit rights but why are they silent on atrocities against scheduled castes in Rajasthan and other states”.He also wondered why leaders from various political parties, like the TMC, who went to Uttar Pradesh on “political tourism” after the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, do not visit the Congress-ruled states when incidents of atrocities against Dalits are reported from there.  BJP general secretary Dushyant Gautam also accused the Congress of “showing disrespect to Dalit icon BR Ambedkar”, saying that the party “never gave him his due respect in its regime”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-kheri-bjp-slams-congress-over-selective-outrage-323636

12-10-2021||---||HC seeks Centre’s response on plea seeking deletion of ‘prime minister’ tag from PM CARES Fund trust||Mumbai, October 12The Bombay High Court on Tuesday sought the Union government’s reply to a petition seeking deletion of the name ‘Prime Minister’ from the PM CARES Fund trust and also deletion of the PM’s photo as well as images of the national flag and the emblem of India from the trust’s official website.The Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Congress member Vikrant Chavan said this was violative of the provisions of the Constitution of India and The Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act.The PIL, which was heard by a division bench of Justices A A Sayed and S G Dige, sought a direction to the Centre to remove the name ‘Prime Minister’ from the fund trust’s name- Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARES) Fund.The plea also sought deletion of the photographs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the emblem of India and the national flag from the trust’s website.According to the petition, this was in violation of the provisions of the Constitution of India and The Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act.The plea claimed the trust was set up on March 27, 2020, as a public charitable trust to extend support and relief for a public health emergency or any other kind of emergency or calamity.The fund trust claims to consist of voluntary contributions made by individuals/organisations and does not get any budgetary support from the government and the contributions made would qualify for 100 per cent exemption under the Income Tax Act.“The trust does not discharge any governmental or sovereign functions. It is an admitted position that the trust is not a Government of India fund and the amount collected by it does not go to the Consolidated Fund of India,” the petition said.In such a position it would be improper for the trust to use the name of the Prime Minister or his photograph and the image of the national flag and the Emblem of India on its official website.The high court on Tuesday heard the matter briefly and directed Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, appearing for the Centre, to respond to the plea and posted it for hearing on October 25.

12-10-2021||Indore||MP: Four of a particular minority community held for participating in garba event||Four youngsters of a particular minority community were held after the fringe Hindu group Bajrang Dal complained that they had attended a college 'garba' event that they claimed violated Covid norms and was held to promote “Love Jihad”.Adnan Shah, Mohammad Umar, Abdul Qadir, and Syed Saqib were released on bonds of Rs 50,000.  This comes after the fringe Hindu group created ruckus at the event over the participation of a particular non-Hindu community at the event.   “Love jihad” is a term members of the Hindu right frequently use to describe what they see as an act of illegal conversion to particular a minority religion. Several BJP- ruled states have even passed laws to stop such “illegal conversions”, although many critics and experts have frequently pointed out that these are used to target minorities—one community in particular.Police have booked arrested the four non-Hindu youngsters and were charged with CrPC section 151 (Arrest to prevent the commission of cognizable offences) for the “fear of disrupting public peace”. Police have also registered a case against the organisers for allowing more than the number of people permitted at the event, also on the basis of a complaint by the fringe Hindu group, Bajrang Dal.Garba dance is organised in different pandals during the ongoing Navratri festival. “They (the four youths) were arrested under CrPC section 151 (Arrest to prevent the commission of cognizable offences) from a private college campus in Gandhi Nagar area during garba,” Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Parag Jain said.Additional Superintendent of Police Prashant Choube meanwhile claims the suspects were arrested after an argument with some others at the programme.All four of them have been sent to jail for fear of disrupting public peace, he said.Tarun Devda, fringe Hindu group Bajrang Dal’s local coordinator, claimed in his complaint that the administration had given permission for 800 guests but organisers turned it into a commercial event and sold more tickets, giving nearly 2,000-3000 people entry into the event.His complaint took particular objection to people of a particular minority community being present at the event.Devda claimed that by inviting Muslims to an event during the holy Navratri, the college was "encouraging" them to participate in such Hindu festivals.Police have booked Akshay Tiwari from the college’s management under section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) but have arrested him.Congress spokesman Ameenul Khan Suri called the arrests unconstitutional and slammed the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in the state. “Why can’t people belonging to different religions participate in each other’s festivals in MP? Police and administration should follow the Constitution of the country,” he said.  'What was their crime'Their family are still puzzled why their sons were arrested.Abdul Hamid Shah, Adnan's father, told PTI that his son was a student of second year B.Com."He was serving there as a volunteer and was handling light and sound system during the programme,” Shah said as he held up the college’s identity card and an invitation to the programme“On what basis my son was sent to jail under CrPC 151? We feel it was done under political pressure.”   Abdul Aleem, Qadir's elder brother, said, like Adnan, his brother was a volunteer at the event.—Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-four-of-a-particular-minority-community-held-for-participating-in-garba-event-323613
12-10-2021||Nur-Sultan (Kazakhstan)||India asks int’l community to unite against terrorism as seriously as it does on issues like climate change and pandemics||In a veiled attack on Pakistan, India said on Tuesday that cross-border terrorism is not statecraft but simply another form of the menace as it called upon the international community to unite against this evil, as seriously as it does on issues like climate change and pandemics.Addressing the 6th meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Conference of Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) here, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also asserted that connectivity must respect the most basic principle of international relations—respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, an apparent reference to India’s objection to China’s ambitious infrastructure development plans in Pakistan under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).“If peace and development is our common goal, the biggest enemy we must overcome is terrorism. In this day and age, we cannot countenance its use by one state against another. Cross-border terrorism is not statecraft; it is simply another form of terrorism,” he told the gathering without naming any country.He said the international community “must unite against this menace, as seriously as it does on issues like climate change and pandemics.”             “Any calculation that extremism, radicalisation, violence and bigotry can be used to advance interests is a very short-sighted one. Such forces will come back to haunt those who nurture them. Lack of stability will also undermine our collective efforts to get Covid under control. The situation in Afghanistan is, therefore, of grave concern,” he said.Jaishankar had earlier this week said that India was closely following the developments in Afghanistan and underscored the importance of the Taliban regime meeting the expectations of the international community as elaborated in the UN Security Council Resolution 2593.The UNSC resolution 2593 unequivocally demands that Afghan territory not be used for sheltering, training, planning or financing terrorist acts; and specifically refers to terrorist individuals proscribed by the UN Security Council, including Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad.The Taliban, ousted from power by the US shortly after the 9/11 attacks, seized control of Afghanistan in mid-August, ousting the previous elected government which was backed by the West.India has called for ensuring that no country “tries to take advantage of the delicate situation in Afghanistan and use it for its own selfish interests.”            Jaishankar said that the voice of the CICA can play a positive role in shaping global response towards the developments in Afghanistan.     “Highlighted that Afghanistan developments have generated understandable concern. Voice of CICA can be a positive factor in shaping a global response,” he tweeted.In his speech, Jaishankar also said that promotion of economic and social activity is intrinsic to progress and prosperity. Asia, in particular, suffers from a deficit of connectivity which is so essential for that purpose, he added.“As we build these modern arteries of commerce, it is absolutely essential that the most basic principles of international relations are observed. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations rank foremost among them,” he said, amid China’s aggressive behaviour in the Indo-Pacific region.The CPEC, which connects Gwadar Port in Balochistan with China’s Xinjiang province, is the flagship project of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Originally valued at USD 46 billion, the CPEC projects were worth USD 62 billion as of 2017.India has protested to China over the CPEC as it is being laid through PoK.“It is also important that connectivity building is a participative and consensual exercise, based on financial viability and local ownership. They must not serve other agendas,” he said.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years.Jaishankar also underlined the forum’s relevance in addressing contemporary challenges, including pandemics and protection of global commons.“Even as the world seeks to overcome the pandemic, there are equally pressing challenges it must address. Climate action ranks high among them. In many ways, the mind-set required is similar if we are to decisively forge ahead. Both pandemic and climate change require genuine and sincere international collaboration. They must ensure accessibility and affordability, especially to the most vulnerable. And they are a call for us all to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle,” he said.Noting that the post-pandemic world requires resilient and reliable supply chains, he said, “it encourages additional engines of economic growth. It also puts a premium on greater trust and transparency. CICA can make a notable contribution to all these endeavours that will enhance security and sustainable development in Asia.”  “We have always seen the world as a family, expressed in the concept of ‘VasudhaivaKutumbakam’. Naturally, this applies in even greater measure to Asia. Our belief is expressed in a variety of ways, including in meeting challenges and finding solutions together. This was clearly in evidence during the Covid pandemic, when we provided vaccines, medicines and medical supplies, as well as expertise to more than 150 nations,” he said.He said that any collective, including families, are best served by participative and consultative decision-making.“Eight decades ago, when the current global order was being debated, it was a very different world. The members of the UN have quadrupled since then. Asia especially, but also Africa and Latin America, are inadequately represented in its decision-making. The limitations of the multilateral response to the Covid pandemic were starkly evident. This only makes a case for reformed multilateralism more urgent with each passing day,” he said.In his address to the 75th anniversary of the UN last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given a clarion call for UN reform and asked for how long will India be kept out of the decision-making structures of the United Nations.Jaishankar also appreciated Kazakhstan’s initiative in consolidating the unique CICA forum and underlined its relevance in addressing contemporary challenges, including terrorism, pandemics and protection of global commons.Jaishankar arrived in Kazakhstan from Kyrgyzstan on Monday on the second leg of his three-nation tour to Central Asia.

Searches were then conducted by the NIA in Chennai, Coimbatore and Vijayawada at premises of the accused.

However, there's no confirmation whether Das was the pilot at the time of the crash on Monday, KYMA.com, a CBS/NBC-affiliated TV station, reported on Tuesday."We are deeply sad to hear news of a plane owned by local cardiologist Sugata Das, which crashed near Santee (California)," YRMC's Chief Medical Officer Bharat Magu said in a statement."As an outstanding cardiologist and dedicated family man, Das leaves a lasting legacy. We extend our prayers and support to his family, colleagues, and friends during this difficult time," Magu said.The crash near Santana High School in Santee appeared to have sparked a fire that burned at least two homes, damaged five others and several vehicles, but responding firefighters were able to put out the blaze before it spread to other houses.Another person who died was a UPS worker who was on the ground.UPS confirmed that one of its employees was killed during the plane crash. "We are heartbroken by the loss of our employee, and extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We also send our condolences for the other individuals who are involved in this incident, and their families and friends."

Sources said China diverted from the laid down agenda for the talks — disengaging from Patrolling Point 15 (Hot Springs). The Ministry of Defence said: “The Indian side made constructive suggestions for resolving the remaining areas (of friction along the LAC), but the Chinese side was not agreeable and also could not provide any forward-looking proposals. The meeting thus did not result in resolution of the remaining areas.”The 13th round of military talks (since June 6, 2020) ended at 7 pm last night at Moldo garrison of China. The Indian side said the situation along the LAC was the result of unilateral attempts by China to alter the status quo in violation of various bilateral agreements. It was necessary that the Chinese side took appropriate steps in the remaining areas to restore peace along the LAC.The Indian side has been insisting on restoring status quo, as on April 2020.The Western Theatre Command of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), however, blamed India for the failure of talks. Spokesperson for the PLA’s Western Theatre Command Senior Colonel Long Shaohua claimed, “The Chinese side made great efforts to promote easing of the border situation and fully demonstrated China’s sincerity of maintaining overall interests of bilateral military relations.”“The Indian side persisted in its unreasonable and unrealistic demands, which added difficulties to the negotiations… Instead of misjudging the situation, the Indian side should cherish the hard-won situation in China-India border areas,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/beijing-diverts-from-agenda-lac-talks-fail-323277

Therefore, any fear of coal stocks depleting is erroneous and misplaced. Coal MinistrySituation ‘very critical’The power situation is very critical in the entire country. Several Chief Ministers have written to the Centre about it. All are trying together to improve the situation. — Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi Chief MinisterThe Coal Ministry, in a statement, has said there is ample coal to meet the demand of thermal power plants. The 72-lakh-tonne stock at power plants is sufficient for four days. Moreover, Coal India Limited (CIL) has a stock of more than 400 lakh tonnes, which is being supplied to power plants.Ideally, coal stocks at power plants should be for two months.In an indication that the government is focused on removing the supply constraints, Shah met Power Minister RK Singh, Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi and senior officials from the two ministries.The meeting was informed that the domestic coal supply was being increased to build up sufficient stocks. The CIL will increase its daily coal supply to 16 lakh tonnes by the month-end from 14 lakh tonnes it had supplied during the rains. Its subsidiaries and captive coal blocks will contribute another three lakh tonnes every day.The Coal Ministry, in a statement, gave two reasons that triggered low stocks of coal at power plants. First, daily shortfall of one lakh tonne due to the extended monsoon. Second, high international prices of coal which reduced generation at import-based power plants by almost 30 per cent.The ministry, however, pointed out that the coal available at the power plants gets replenished daily. “Therefore, any fear of coal stocks depleting is erroneous,” it reiterated.The CIL supplied more than 255 million tonnes of coal to the power sector this year — the highest ever H-1 supply from the CIL to the power sector — despite heavy rainfall in the coal fields.“The comfortable coal position in the country is reflected by the fact that the CIL is supplying 2.5 lakh tonnees daily to meet the demand of non-power industries,” added the ministry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ramping-up-supply-to-build-enough-coal-stock-ministry-323287

Both are from the same village and known to each other well". The key accused, who is a drug addict, had dragged the woman into the fields and forced himself on her, according to the police officer, even as local officials said the woman was raped at gunpoint."The role of other people in the act could be ascertained after investigation. The key accused is on the run and details could be confirmed after his arrest," she said.DCP Shukla said the rape survivor was taken to the district hospital after the incident where her health condition was stable on Monday.The police said an FIR has been lodged under relevant sections of the law on the basis of a complaint by the woman's husband and an investigation is underway.BSP chief Mayawati condemned the incident, while a Congress delegation from Noida went to meet the family of the rape survivor."The gang-rape of a Dalit woman in Gautam Buddh Nagar is extremely sad and shameful. The BSP demands that the BJP government in UP take strong action against the accused persons, and give justice to the affected family," Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.Congress leader Pankhuri Pathak, who led a party delegation to meet the Dalit woman's family, described the incident as a "heinous crime" and alleged failure of law and order in the region."Jewar's name is now heard often because of an airport being developed in the area but this incident of gangrape gives one an idea of the law and order situation in the area, which is close to Delhi," Pathak said.She added that the delegation was going to meet the family on instructions of the Congress high command.Azad Samaj Party chief Chandra Shekhar Aazad also hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government over the incident."In Gautam Buddh Nagar, a Dalit woman was gang-raped at gunpoint by barbarians and casteist slurs were hurled at her. The barbarians have no fear of the law. Law and order has completely failed in UP.
