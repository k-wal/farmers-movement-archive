04-10-2021||Lakhimpur Kheri (UP)||A day after violence, uneasy calm pervades Lakhimpur Kheri||An uneasy calm prevailed in Lakhimpur Kheri on Monday, a day after eight people were killed in violent clashes during a farmers’ protest.There was heavy police deployment at most of the crossings in the district, around 150 km from Uttar Pradesh’s capital city, Lucknow.Most of the shops remained shut except those dealing with medicines and other essential goods.Prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC are in force in the district and Internet services have also been discontinued to maintain law and order in the wake of the clash on Sunday.Due to the restrictions, fewer people were seen in public places here in the morning but as the day passed more people came outside and gathered at roadside shops. Not many vehicles were seen on the roads but the public transport plied normally.En route to Tikonia, the venue of Sunday’s violence, the roads were abuzz with people, probably farmers and officials, coming and going towards the area, which is around 50 km from the district headquarters.Locals and officials refrained from talking when asked to comment on the incident that caught national attention.This was the bloodiest clash since the farmers’ protest over the Centre agriculture laws began last year.Four of the dead were farmers, allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya.The others were BJP workers and their driver, allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and then lynched by the protesters. Two cars were set on fire.Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra, who is a two-time BJP MP from Kheri, has denied allegation by the farmers’ unions that his son was in one of the cars. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-day-after-violence-uneasy-calm-pervades-lakhimpur-kheri-320090
04-10-2021||New Delhi||‘Not a terrorist’: Sharjeel Imam tells court, calls his prosecution ‘whip of monarch’||JNU student Sharjeel Imam, arrested for allegedly making inflammatory speeches during the protests against CAA and NRC, on Monday told a Delhi court that he is not a terrorist and his prosecution is a “whip of a monarch rather than a government established by law”.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat was hearing a case filed against Imam for the alleged speeches given by him at two universities in 2019, where he allegedly threatened to “cut off” Assam and the rest of the Northeast from India.The alleged inflammatory speeches for which he was arrested were allegedly made at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13, 2019, and at Aligarh Muslim University on December 16, 2019. He is in judicial custody since January 2020.He was arrested under the provisions of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). A charge of sedition was also slapped against him.Seeking bail as well as discharge in the case, advocate Tanveer Ahmed Mir, representing Imam, told the court that being critical of the government cannot be the cause of sedition.“The essence of the entire prosecution is that you talk against us and sedition is on your way,” Mir said, adding that Imam cannot be allowed to be persecuted just because he was critical of CAA or NRC.“This prosecution of Sharjeel Imam is more of a whip of a monarch rather than a government established by law. This is not how the government or executive has to respond. At the end of the day, a dispensation will change. Nothing is permanent,” the advocate further said.Referring to the recent ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by the protesting farmers, Imam’s counsel asked, “Will we call for sedition in all those cases? Asking for rail roko, blocking of roads, etc, is that a constitutional means of protest or not?”He asked will the sedition charges be attracted if farmers say that they want fair prices for the crops or people demand women’s rights.Mir said it is the duty of every citizen to be critical of the government.Since when does the government need the affection of people, he asked. “It is only the monarchs, kings who need the affection of people. We are not here to bow down before the government,” the lawyer submitted.“Unless and until we do not have critical elements in the society, the society will die,” he submitted.The lawyer said that there were many prosecutions against Imam just because he had criticized the government’s policies.“He is not a terrorist or associated with some terrorist outfit. He has no criminal antecedents, he does not have any political agenda,” he told the court.Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad said that the fundamental right to protest cannot go beyond an extent that causes problems to the public at large.He told the court that violent riots took place pursuant to Imam’s speech. “He tried to create anarchy by saying that there is no hope left for the Muslim community and that there is no other way left,” Prasad said, opposing his bail and discharge in the case.Imam is accused of offenses relating to sedition, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, imputations prejudicial to national integration, and public mischief under the Indian Penal Code, and indulging in unlawful activities under the UAPA.Delhi Police had filed a charge sheet against Imam in the case, in which it alleged that he allegedly gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt, and disaffection towards the Central Government and instigated the people which led to the violence in December 2019.

04-10-2021||New Delhi||Lakhimpur Kheri: Why Adityanath and BJP need to be worried in UP||While the Opposition steps up offensive and allegations pile against BJP leaders, including Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Union Minister Ajay Mishra Teni, for their purported controversial remarks, problems are also mounting for Chief Minister Adityanath who will face the Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh a few weeks from now. With the fall-out of the 2017-farmer deaths in Mandsaur (MP) still not so far away, the question is will Adityanath be able to ride the political challenge of 2021-Lakhimpur Kheri farmers’ deaths in the 2022 elections. Mishra has denied that his son Ashish Mishra was present at the time of the incident. “My son wasn’t present at the spot. There were miscreants who attacked workers with sticks and swords. If my son would’ve been there, he wouldn’t have come out alive,” the BJP’s prominent Brahmin face, on who much is riding, was quoted as saying. However, a purported video of him warning agitating farmers that he would discipline them in “two minutes” is something that the leadership may find difficult to explain. While Mishra’s influence in Kheri earned him a BJP Lok Sabha ticket for the 2014 elections, ground reports are now suggesting growing anger against him and his party despite a “settlement” between the Uttar Pradesh government and farmers over Lakhimpur Kheri violence. Observers say that unless the BJP takes some “visible action” against him, the Lakhimpur Kheri deaths have the potential to impact its fortunes in UP elections, quite like Mandsaur deaths in the 2018 Madhya Pradesh polls.“The incident may not be forgotten easily. Even if the BJP makes some more overtures and steps to cool down the sentiments, the opposition will do its best to keep the heat on. Farmers constitute a sizable number of UP’s rural population. The saving grace for the BJP and Adityanath is that there is still some time to recover,” says a political observer.  According to analysts, death of farmers in agitations on agrarian issues is always an emotive issue. The deaths of farmers agitating for loan waiver and higher remuneration for their produce on June 6, 2017, in police firing in Mandsaur is believed to be one of the reasons for Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan losing Madhya Pradesh in 2018.Though Chouhan blamed the Opposition for inciting farmers, the Congress made the deaths a major election issue. It is another matter though that in 2020 Chouhan managed to wrest back the power from Congress’ Kamal Nath after Jyotiraditya Scindia and his loyalist MLAs walked out of the grand old party.So far as Mishra is concerned, the saffron party has been projecting him as a prominent Brahmin leader and holding public meetings for him to drum up support for 2022. Some observers believe that in this case, he may also act as a polarising factor for the community, which is otherwise believed to be upset with the saffron party.   Notably, Mishra’s purported speech came in the backdrop of some farmers showing him black flags in Palia locality in his Kheri Parliamentary constituency where he had gone to address a public meeting sometime last month. Since then, farmers have been up in arms against him, say sources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-kheri-why-adityanath-and-bjp-need-to-be-worried-in-up-320087
04-10-2021||New Delhi||Covid-19 vaccine delivery through drones starts in Northeast||Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday launched an initiative to facilitate Covid-19 vaccine delivery to tough and hard-to-reach terrains of the Northeast through drones.The ICMR’s Drone Response and Outreach in North East (i-Drone), a delivery model to make sure that life-saving Covid vaccines reach everyone, is in line with the government’s commitment to ‘Antyodaya’ in health - making healthcare accessible to the last citizen of the country, officials said.“This is for the first time that a ‘Make in India’ drone has been used in South Asia to transport Covid-19 vaccine over an aerial distance of 15 km in 12-15 mins from the Bishnupur district hospital to Loktak lake, Karang island in Manipur for administration at the PHC.“The actual road distance between these locations is 26 km. Today, 10 beneficiaries will receive the first dose and eight will receive the second dose at the PHC,” Mandaviya said.ICMR’s Drone Response and Outreach in North East (i-Drone) intervention will revolutionize the last mile delivery of COVID-19 vaccines in India. This is also a big step in ensuring the last mile delivery of other vaccines and medical supplies as quickly as possible #ICMR4NewIndia pic.twitter.com/RHIIO4vbAT  Thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Union health minister said, “Under his leadership, the nation is progressing at a great pace. Today is a historic day, which showed us how technology is making life easier and bringing social change.”                India is home to geographical diversities and drones can be used to deliver essentials to the last mile, he said.“We can use drones in delivering important life-saving medicines, collecting blood samples. This technology can also be used in critical situations. This technology may prove a game-changer in addressing the challenges in health care delivery, particularly health supplies in difficult areas,” Mandaviya said.Launching the initiative which would facilitate vaccine delivery to hard-to-reach terrains of India, the Union health minister said, “Our immunisation programme for Covid-19 has already exceeded all expectations.“I strongly believe that this initiative will further help us achieve the highest possible immunisation coverage for Covid-19. Incorporating such drone technologies into the national programmes would help deliver other vaccines and medical supplies as quickly as possible.”Despite the effective and safe vaccine administration in the states and Union Territories, the vaccine delivery in tough and hard-to-reach terrains of India is still challenging.The i-Drone has been designed to overcome these challenges by deploying Unmanned Aerial vehicles (UAV) / drones to remote areas, the Health Ministry said.Currently, the drone-based delivery project has been granted permission for implementation in Manipur and Nagaland, as well as the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.The ICMR conducted an initial study in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur to test the capacity of drones to carry and transfer vaccines safely.The study was conducted in Manipur, Nagaland and Andaman and Nicobar. These studies provided promising results on the basis of which the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and other regulatory authorities have granted permission to fly drones beyond the Visual Line Of Sight.Mandaviya expressed confidence in the initiative and noted that it can be helpful in delivering not only vaccines but also other medical supplies. This will help in overcoming the gaps in current vaccine delivery mechanisms, he said.                He thanked the Ministry of Civil Aviation, DGCA and the Airport Authority of India for their support towards this endeavour and congratulated ICMR, health workers and all associated with this landmark initiative.  —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-vaccine-delivery-through-drones-starts-in-northeast-320085
04-10-2021||London||UK eases travel rules but upsets nations not on list||Simplified international travel rules took effect Monday in the UK, easing quarantine and testing requirements for fully vaccinated travelers from more than 50 countries, and the Conservative government vowed it will seek to regularly expand the rules to more nations.Still, the rules have sparked anger from many nations in the developing world, particularly India, which have been excluded from the list of countries whose vaccination programmes are accepted by UK authorities. New Delhi said on Friday that British citizens traveling in India would have to undergo Covid-19 tests and 10 days of quarantine, similar to the measures imposed on Indian residents visiting the UK.As part of the new regime, Britain eased entry requirements for fully vaccinated travelers from 18 countries, including Canada, Japan and the United Arab Emirates. It builds on a pilot phase with US and most European countries that began over the summer.The Department for Transport said it would take a “phased approach” to recognising vaccines administered by additional countries and territories.“The UK government is continuing to work with international partners as we seek to more regularly expand the policy to further countries and territories,” the department said.Under the new rules, Britain scrapped its traffic light system for international travel, which applied different rules to travelers from countries in three different categories of Covid-19 risk. Now there are just two categories: a “red list,” which bars most non-essential travel, and the rest of the world.But travelers from non-red list countries aren’t all treated equally.Those who have been fully vaccinated with one of four authorised vaccines and have a certificate from a recognized public health agency are now allowed to enter the U.K. without a negative pre-departure Covid-19 test and without being required to quarantine on arrival.But travelers coming from countries whose vaccination programmes aren’t recognised by UK authorities will still be required to show a pre-departure test and quarantine for 10 days.Most countries in Africa and South America, as well as major Asian nations such as China, India and Vietnam, don’t have vaccination programmes that are authorised by the UK. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-eases-travel-rules-but-upsets-nations-not-on-list-320081
04-10-2021||New Delhi||Experts advise responsible travel, say mass gatherings can worsen possible 3rd Covid wave||Stressing on responsible travel, researchers have warned that a rise in population density driven by tourist arrivals or mass congregations due to social, religious or political events can lead to a surge in Covid infections worsening an anticipated third wave scenario in selected states.Illustrating a scenario where population density in India has a stronger effect on transmission than in the USA, researchers said a holiday period can amplify a possible third wave peak by up to 103 per cent and cumulative incidence in that wave by 43 per cent.It can also hasten the timing of the epidemic peak by four weeks, compared to a scenario of easing restrictions in the absence of holiday travel, they said.The opinion piece, based on mathematical models ‘Responsible travel to and within India during the Covid-19 pandemic’, by Balram Bhargava, Samiran Panda and Sandip Mandal from ICMR and Nimalan Arinaminpathy from Imperial College London, has been published in the Journal of Travel Medicine.In their study, the researchers illustrated some possible scenarios in a hypothetical state in India constructed to resemble Himachal Pradesh in the dynamics of its first and second waves, including the much lower seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 compared to the rest of the country.“A sudden increase in population density due to incoming tourists or mass congregations due to social, political or religious reasons can worsen the third wave scenario,” the researchers said in the opinion piece.Data from Himachal Pradesh suggests that in a typical holiday season, tourism can increase the population by 40 per cent.A recent study in the USA suggests that an increase in one unit of log population density increased R0 (the basic reproduction number/rate) by 0.16.“Taking this into consideration, the third-wave peak can increase by up to 47 per cent during the holiday season and can occur two weeks earlier compared to a scenario of easing restrictions in the absence of holiday travel,” researchers said.India’s second wave of Covid-19 was severe but showed varying impacts in different states. Smaller states with rarefied populations witnessed not only less intense spread than was apparent at the national level but also delayed attainment of the second peak, they observed.Giving examples of popular tourist destinations such as Manali and Darjeeling, the researchers said that observations indicate increasing opportunities for transmission in areas where population-level immunity has not yet accumulated to the same levels as elsewhere in the country.“Against a backdrop of increasing anticipation of a third wave of Covid-19 in India, it is important to recognize the potential risks associated with such an escalation in travel,” they said.Proposing ‘responsible travel’, researchers said mask use and observing social distancing norms by tourists can have important effects in mitigating the risk of disease transmission.Beyond their protective effect, mandating these precautions will also serve as an important and continuing reminder of the risk of Covid-19, they said, adding conditions on travel like allowing tourists only with recent Covid-negative test report can also play a key role.Vaccine status can also play an important role in eligibility to travel, with some caveats, researchers said.“Vaccine passports have limitations, arising from uncertainties about how the nature and strength of vaccine-induced immunity would change over time. Also, despite being the world’s largest producer of Covid-19 vaccines, India faces the challenge of having the world’s second-largest population to vaccinate.“Nonetheless, as vaccination coverage scales, vaccine status can play an increasingly important role in eligibility to travel,” they said.Immunisation planning may also benefit from prioritising the local population in holiday destinations. Maintaining surveillance in at-risk settings, ensuring that virological testing is maintained even during apparent low infection activity will be important, the opinion piece stated.Information on genomic surveillance in other nations and vigil at international airports will be valuable for early identification of unrecognised variants, it said.Observing that no national guideline exists on restrictions about domestic travel, the researchers said it may be helpful for holiday-destination states to get guidance on how they can best mitigate travel-related risks.“With the possibility of a severe third wave in India still looming, it remains critical to recognize and mitigate the risks involved.“A shared sense of responsibility, amongst visitors, residents and local authorities, will go a long way towards protecting the welfare of the country as a whole,” the researchers added.

04-10-2021||Mumbai||About 46 pc Indians plan to travel in Oct-Dec: Survey||As much as 46 per cent of the respondents in India are looking to travel in October-December, even as only six per cent of them have made bookings, indicating that most of them may look either for last-minute deals or opt for a road journey, as per a survey.The survey, conducted by the online platform LocalCircles, also revealed that the festive season (October-December) is likely to see a 60 per cent jump in citizens travelling as compared to the monsoon season (August-September).About 34 per cent of respondents said they are planning to visit family and friends in October-December.Some major festivals in India fall during the October-December period of the year.It can be mentioned that many families had to cancel their summer travel plans amid the drastic surge of the second wave of the pandemic that reached its peak in mid-May, the survey said.As the country started unlocking the economy after the outbreak, LocalCircles said, a study conducted by it found out that 28 per cent of respondents had made plans to travel during August and September.LocalCircles has conducted another survey to understand the travel plans of people from October to December. The survey also tried to understand how domestic travel is picking up through a comparative analysis with a similar survey conducted in July this year, the platform said in a release.The survey received more than 19,000 responses from citizens, comprising 64 per cent males and 36 per cent females, from across 331 districts—a mix of Tier-1, Tier-2, Tier-3 as well as Tier-4 cities.All the respondents were validated citizens, who had to be registered with LocalCircles to participate in this survey, the release said.The Central government has eased most of the travel restrictions after the Covid-19 second wave, barring international travel. Most of the state governments have also eased travel restrictions completely, with a few still demanding that travellers produce RT-PCR test reports if not double dose vaccinated, according to LocalCircles.The rise in travel during the festive season is also likely to boost the hospitality sector, which recorded a revenue per available room (RevPAR) of Rs 1,582 during FY21, the lowest in the last 22 years, the release said quoting a report by Hotelivate.According to the survey, there were also 38 per cent of citizens who “have no plans to travel during these three months”, and 16 per cent are undecided or couldn’t say.“On an aggregate basis, 46 per cent of citizens are planning to travel during October to December though only 6 per cent have made their bookings,” LocalCircles said, adding that the travel includes all modes of transport—road, rail and air.A similar survey conducted in July found that only 28 per cent of citizens planned to travel during August and September, it said.When the responses given by citizens are aggregated on the basis of type as some plan to undertake multiple types of travel, it was found out that 34 per cent plan to “visit family and friends”, 28 per cent to visit a “holiday destination”, and 23 per cent “other kinds of travel”, according to LocalCircles.“In summary, 48 per cent of citizens plan to travel during October-December though only 6 per cent have made their bookings. This indicates that airlines, hotels, travel portals are likely to see strong demand as the festive season progresses.“Of those who plan to travel in October-December, 34 per cent plan to visit family and friends. A comparative analysis of the latest survey with a survey published in July found that October-December is likely to see 60 per cent jump in citizens travelling as compared to Monsoon Season (August-September),” the platform said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/about-46-pc-indians-plan-to-travel-in-oct-dec-survey-320079

Your sub-inspectors are doing whatever they want to,” the judge said.“Don’t you know what is happening? What your beat constables are doing? Why are you not letting them (operate)? I am cautioning you. Tell your beat constables. People will come to courts,” the judge told the concerned station house officer who was present during the hearing conducted through video conferencing.Counsel for the Delhi Police stated that the authorities were in no manner restraining the operation of spas that possess a valid health trade licence and were following the applicable Covid-19 protocol. “We are not stopping them if there is a valid health licence. We will strictly follow the legal principles,” said the counsel.“If they (police) don’t (follow), I know what to do,” said the judge.The court took on record the stand of the authorities and said that no orders are called for on the petition now.In its petition filed through lawyer Himanshu Dagar, the petitioner—owner of a spa located in Chandani Chowk—alleged that the police were arbitrarily, unlawfully, and unjustifiably interfering with the re-opening of his outlet despite due compliance with all norms, rules, and regulations issued by the competent authorities.The petition informed that in July, spas in the city were permitted to be re-opened by the Delhi government in view of the declining cases of Covid-19 subject to certain conditions.However, the officials of the local police station “started forcing” the petitioner to shut down his spa without any rhyme or reason, it added.“This harassment by the officials of the local police station and the staff of the Chowki has become a daily routine... the petitioner has been under a tremendous loss of finances and is even unable to pay rent, electricity bills, staff salaries, and home expenses because of shutting down of his Spa & Wellness clinic by the officials of the local police station and the staff of the chowki,” the petition claimed.It was submitted that the conduct of the officials was in violation of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India and thus prayed that a direction be issued for allowing the re-opening of the spa in accordance with the applicable conditions. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-interfere-with-operation-of-licenced-spas-hc-tells-delhi-police-320068
04-10-2021||Mumbai||Manhandling of Priyanka Gandhi shows UP government, Centre are scared: Sachin Pilot||The alleged “manhandling” of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra by the Uttar Pradesh Police shows that the BJP-led state and central governments are “scared”, senior Congress leader Sachin Pilot said on Monday.Addressing a press conference here, Pilot said the alleged “misbehaviour” with Priyanka Gandhi also shows that the Adityanath-led dispensation “has the habit of operating beyond the law of the land”.The former Rajasthan deputy chief minister demanded a judicial probe into the killing of eight people, including four farmers, on Sunday after violence erupted during a farmers’ protest in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri district.He said those guilty should be given the harshest punishment and the families of the farmers who died should be adequately compensated.“You saw how they behaved with Priyanka Gandhi. I feel that the manhandling with any one leader shows that the BJP governments in the state and Centre are scared,” Pilot said.Priyanka Gandhi and other Congress leaders accompanying her, including MP Deepender Hooda, had reached the Lakhimpur Kheri border in the morning but were not allowed to meet the families of the farmers who died in the violence, the party has alleged.“When our party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi wanted to meet the family of the deceased farmers, the Uttar Pradesh administration and the police misbehaved with her, a woman leader. This reflects its mindset. We condemn this incident,” Pilot said.He said Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were stopped last year, too, when they were on their way to meet the family of the Hathras rape victim.Even this time, Priyanka Gandhi was illegally stopped, without any order, and later detained, Pilot said.The former Union minister said while section 144 of the IPC (which prohibits unlawful assembly) was imposed in Lakhimpur Kheri, Chhattishgarh Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel was not allowed to even land at the Lucknow airport.Referring to Haryana Chief Minister M L Khattar’s alleged  “tit for tat” comment during a meeting of the BJP’s Kisan Morcha on Sunday when he told the gathering to form groups of 500 to 1,000 and be prepared to even go to jail, Pilot said if people holding constitutional posts instigate people, it will weaken democracy.He said over the last year, farmers have been staging protests against the three agri-marketing laws enacted by the Modi government in September last year and the Congress will extend every possible help to the stir.Pilot also demanded a thorough probe into the seizure of drugs from the Mundra Port in Gujarat, saying the matter is linked to national security.Last month, the Department of Revenue Intelligence seized a staggering 2,988 kilograms of heroin at the Mundra Port. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/manhandling-of-priyanka-gandhi-shows-up-government-centre-are-scared-sachin-pilot-320067
04-10-2021||New Delhi||Abolish tax havens: Oxfam India on Pandora papers revelations||Oxfam India called for immediately abolishing tax havens after a leak of millions of documents, dubbed the ‘Pandora Papers’, revealed offshore financial assets of wealthy individuals across 91 countries and territories, including India.The leaked documents and a worldwide journalistic partnership on Sunday claimed to have uncovered financial secrets of current and former world leaders, politicians and public officials.The ‘Pandora Papers’ have named 300 Indians, including Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Ambani, Nirav Modi and Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw.Calling for abolishing tax havens, Amitabh Behar, CEO of Oxfam India, said this is another shocking exposé of the oceans of money sloshing around the darkness of the world’s tax havens that must prompt immediate action, as has long been promised.Whenever a politician or business leader claims there is ‘no money’ to pay for health, education, climate damage, innovation and for a fair post-Covid recovery, they know where to look, he said.“Tax havens cost governments around the world USD 427 billion each year. Developing countries are being hardest hit, proportionately. Corporations and the wealthiest individuals that use tax havens are outcompeting those who don’t. Tax havens also help crime and corruption to flourish,” he said.Behar said such tax havens continue to stretch global inequality to the breaking point while the world experiences the largest increase in extreme poverty in decades.“Abolishing tax havens can go a long way towards ensuring that government actually have the access to tax revenue they need to fund quality public expenditure, however at the same time governments must continue to spend more on social welfare and public services as a larger proportion of existing budget allocations to at least provide the bare minimum of services of health and education for all,” he said.Oxfam demanded ending tax secrecy on individuals, offshores and multinational corporations.“Set up a public register on the real owners of bank accounts, trusts, shell companies and assets. Require multinational corporations to publicly report their accounts where they do business, country-by-country. Increasing the use of automatic exchange, allowing revenue authorities access to information they need to track the money,” the Oxfam said in a statement.The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which involved the BBC and ‘The Guardian’ newspaper in the UK and ‘The Indian Express’ in India among 150 media outlets in its investigation, claims it obtained the trove of more than 11.9 million confidential files to find secret financial dealings of many super rich.The ‘Pandora Papers’ are a follow-up to a similar project released in 2016, called the ‘Panama Papers’ compiled by the same journalistic group. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abolish-tax-havens-oxfam-india-on-pandora-papers-revelations-320063

At that time too, all operations were being conducted from T2. The resumption of services via T1 from October 20 will help maintain social distancing measures, uphold passenger safety, and ensure a seamless transit, the CSMIA said in the statement. It also said that all modes of transport to and from the airport will be made available for the convenience of the passengers, as before. CSMIA’s T1 will host 12 registration desks and 12 testing booths across arrivals and departures where passengers can opt to undergo the RT-PCR test at the airport, the statement said.

Dhankar later succumbed to the injuries.Additional Sessions Judge Shivaji Anand will hear the bail plea on Tuesday.Advocate Nitin Vasishth, appearing for the victim and complainant Sonu, said that Kumar should not be released on bail as more accused are yet to be arrested and they, along with Kumar, may influence the witnesses.    The international wrestler who is jail since June 2, 2021, sought relief from the court by asserting that he has been falsely implicated in the alleged murder case and the accusations are levelled with the aim and object of humiliating him and injuring his reputation.In the plea, he said that the “unfortunate demise” of a budding wrestler was sensationalized and the same was exploited against him by parties with a vested interest.The Olympian emphasised that the police left no stone unturned to present a “false and guilty image” of him and fed false information to the media to wrongfully establish a connection between him and renowned gangsters.“They had even gone to the point of painting a grotesque image of the present accused where he was said to be a gangster himself and even questions were raised against his antecedents,” Kumar said in a 16-pages bail plea.However, after filing the charge sheet, all the claims and leaks made by the investigating agency are untrue and without any footing in the reality, the plea filed through advocate Pradeep Rana said.To buttress his contentions, he stated that the FIR was filed after a delay, and statements of witnesses were marred by improvements and contractions, and were deliberately withheld by the investigating agency to build a “false case”.“The investigating agency at the fag end of the investigation cropped up a new version that the deceased had given a dying declaration to the police officials with an aim to add bite to the otherwise toothless case of the prosecution,” Kumar submitted.He also called the FIR a conjoint mix of “assumption, presumption, and mala fide intentions”, adding that the police arrested him in the absence of concrete evidence.The wrestler further said he is no more required for any custodial interrogation, much less for any recovery or discovery of incriminating material as the charge sheet has been filed which shows that the probe against him is over.Kumar said that nothing incriminating has been recovered from him which further corroborates his innocence but the investigating agency in order to build a case against him has attributed certain vehicles and weapons to him.The wrestler further told the court that he has clean antecedents and has never violated any law.“The accused has received various laurels representing India and has made the nation proud by winning medals at numerous International tournaments and championships,” the plea stated and listed out all the medals he has won over the years.  The Olympic wrestler submitted that he is confident to prove his innocence before any court of law and any detention at this stage would only be pre-trial incarceration without any fault on his part being innocent.The police had earlier said that the brawl at the stadium was the result of a conspiracy hatched by Kumar, who wanted to re-establish his supremacy among younger wrestlers.Kumar, along with 12 other accused, has been named in the charge sheet filed by the Delhi Police in August.The Delhi Police had filed an FIR against the accused of offences such as murder, attempt to murder, culpable homicide, criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, robbery, rioting, among other. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/olympic-wrestler-sushil-kumar-seeks-bail-in-chhatrasal-stadium-murder-case-320057

04-10-2021||New Delhi||Centre asks states and UTs to register workers in unorganised sector on its e-Shram portal||The Centre has asked the states and UTs to provide momentum to the drive to register workers in the unorganised sector on its e-Shram portal.Sources said the Union Labour Ministry has communicated with the authorities of the states and UTs in the matter.Since the launch of the portal on August 26, this year, for the benefit of unorganised workers, more than 2.50 crore workers registered on this portal.As per the Economic Survey, 2019-20, an estimated 38 crore workers are engaged in the unorganised sector and employment.Last week, Union Labour Minister Bhupender Yadav also held discussions with the state labour ministers, labour secretaries and commissioners of states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and UTs of Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh regarding progress with respect to registration of unorganised workers under e-Shram portal.He also sought feedback on their preparedness on implementation of various schemes and reforms in light of the registration of the workers.An official source said the response from the states and UTs to the union minister has been encouraging. The portal is the first-ever national database of unorganised workers including migrant workers, construction workers, gig and platform workers.It was instituted in the wake of express need felt for it during the Covid-endued national lockdown, the health crisis, and the wide-ranging shakedown of the polity in which large scale destabilization, loss of jobs and livelihoods occurred.Due to absence of data, especially of migrant workers, who are generally employed in the unorganised sector, the government was impeded in its attempt to reach out to them with succour through its relief and economic rehabilitation packages during the lockdown.An outreach to them was vicarious, and in the nature of an intermediary, through medium of plexus of channels, which, in the final analysis, was alleged was sketchy, erratic and unstructured. Data on all aspects of labour is crucial. Scientifically collected data is bedrock for any evidence-based policy making.In the backdrop of India being a labour-surplus nation, importance of data assumes significance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-asks-states-and-uts%C2%A0to-register-workers-in-unorganised-sector-on-its-e-shram-portal-320048
04-10-2021||Mumbai||Is crushing farmers, stifling Oppn voices new strategy of BJP, asks Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Monday wondered if crushing farmers and stifling the voice of Opposition leaders who stand in their support was the BJP's new strategy, a day after eight people were killed in violence that erupted during a farmers' protest at Lakhimpur Kheri in Uttar Pradesh.Talking to reporters here, Raut said when a rape incident took place at Saki Naka in Mumbai (last month), the BJP raised a hue and cry, and "we (state government) did not stop anyone from going to the crime site"."Farmers have been run over allegedly by the car of a Minister's son (in Lakhimpur Kheri). Where does such cruelty come from?" asked the Rajya Sabha Member, whose party shares power with the NCP and the Congress in Maharashtra.He said Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and other leaders were stopped (by the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh) from going to Lakhimpur Kheri to show solidarity with the farmers protesting over their demand for a repeal of the Centre's three agri-marketing laws."Does the BJP have a new strategy of crushing farmers and stifling the voices of opposition leaders who show solidarity with them?" Raut asked. Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaks about farmers' interests, while state governments headed by the BJP "kill farmers" with cars being run over them, the Sena's chief spokesperson claimed. Raut likened the Lakhimpur Kheri incident to the case of revolutionary Babu Genu, who was run over by a Britisher's truck while protesting in Mumbai during the Independence struggle. Speaking on former Sena MLA Subhash Sabne crossing over to the BJP to fight the upcoming Deglur Assembly bypoll in Maharashtra, Raut wondered if former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis was touring the state's Marathwada region to take stock of farm distress due to recent heavy rains there or to induct a Sena leader into the BJP.

04-10-2021||New Delhi||Govindacharya asks political parties to give primacy to farmers’ interests, not theirs||With Lakhimpur Kheri turning a political battleground, K N Govindacharya, a former key RSS and BJP functionary, on Monday appealed to political parties to give primacy to the interests of farmers and not theirs, and asked the Uttar Pradesh government to not treat the violence there as merely a law and order issue.Expressing his anguish at the incident, he said three aspects of caution must be maintained.The Uttar Pradesh government should keep the extent, depth and complexity of the issue in mind in its response and not merely treat it as a law and order problem, he said.The 78-year-old Govindacharya, who is now associated with various causes, also recalled Mahatma Gandhi’s response to the Chauri Chaura incident and asked protesting farmers to try to understand and follow it.The Chauri Chaura violence had occurred in 1922 after protesters, angry over the death of some of them in police firing, had set fire to a police station, killing its occupants.Gandhi, who was against violence irrespective of any provocation, had halted the non-cooperation movement after this.Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son is among those booked in connection with the violence during a farmers’ protest in Lakhimpur Kheri, officials said on Monday as multiple opposition leaders tried to make their way to the Uttar Pradesh district through the night but were prevented from doing so.Two FIRs were registered a day after clashes claimed the lives of eight people, including four farmers allegedly run over and four people in a convoy of BJP workers who were lynched, the incident propelling Lakhimpur Kheri as a new flashpoint in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh.

04-10-2021||New Delhi||Blood thinners significantly reduce Covid-related mortality, hospitalisation: Lancet||Covid-19 patients who use blood thinners may have a nearly 50 per cent reduced risk of death and a 43 per cent lower risk of hospitalisation, according to a study published in Lancet’s EClinical Medicine journal.The research was conducted on 6,195 patients over the age of 18, who were diagnosed with Covid-19 from March 4 to August 27, 2020, in 12 hospitals and 60 clinics in the US.The researchers from the University of Minnesota, US, and Basel University in Switzerland analysed the relationship between 90-day anticoagulation therapy among out-patients before Covid-19 diagnosis and the risk for hospitalisation and mortality.The researchers also evaluated the association between anticoagulation therapy, which is used to prevent blood clots, and mortality risk among admitted patients.The study found that patients on blood thinners before contracting Covid-19 were 43 per cent less likely to be admitted to hospital, despite being older and having more chronic medical conditions than their peers.Blood thinners, regardless of being used before being infected with Covid-19 or started when admitted to the hospital for treatment of the viral disease, reduce deaths by almost half, they added.Overall, hospitalised Covid-19 patients benefit from blood thinners regardless of the type or dose of the medication used, the researchers noted.“Many individuals with Covid-19 develop abnormal blood clots from high inflammation, which can lead to serious health complications and mortality,” said study lead author Sameh Hozayen, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota.“Blood thinners are medications prescribed to prevent blood clots in patients with a prior blood clot in their lungs or legs. They also prevent blood clots in the brain secondary to abnormal heart rhythms, like atrial fibrillation,” Hozayen wrote in the journal.The researchers said blood thinners are the standard of treatment in these diseases, which is why they looked at data to see if it impacted hospitalisations related to Covid-19.“We already know that overwhelmed hospitals have a higher risk for death among their patients, so reducing hospitalisation may have a positive impact during a Covid-19 surge,” Hozayen added.The researchers also noted that about half the patients prescribed blood thinners for blood clots in their legs, lungs, abnormal heart rhythms or other reasons do not take them.Increasing adherence for people already prescribed blood thinners can potentially reduce the bad effects of Covid-19, they said.“At most centers around the world now, there are protocols for starting blood thinners when patients are first admitted to the hospital for Covid-19 — as it is a proven vital treatment option,” Hozayen said.“Outside of Covid-19, the use of blood thinners is proven to be lifesaving for those with blood coagulations conditions,” the scientist added.The team is currently working with research groups in other parts of the world such as Egypt to look at how blood thinners impact patients in less-invested health care systems and in different patient populations.

During the course of all these years, I have been a witness to the comprehensive transformation of our ties.“Yesterday, I had the pleasure of visiting Kandy for a darshan of the blessed Dalada Maligawa temple. I also visited Trincomalee and Jaffna where I saw the Jaffna Cultural Centre, an iconic project built with Indian grant assistance,” he said.These places vividly recount the shared cultural heritage of the two countries and the strong bilateral development partnership, he said.Shringla said that the high-level visits, in particular the state visits of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to India in November 2019 and February 2020 respectively, have given fresh impetus to the bilateral relations.“The virtual bilateral summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in September 2020 was an important milestone as it set the template for the future evolution of our cooperation in fields such as defence and security, health, tourism, trade and commerce and people to people ties,” the Foreign Secretary said.In the past one year, India has buttressed its credentials of being a net security provider and first responder in HADR (Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief ) situations in the wider Indian Ocean region, he said.India was happy to respond to Sri Lanka’s requests in recent cases of fire and marine pollution in its waters, Shringla said, adding that the Indian Navy also deployed its assets for rapid delivery of medical grade oxygen to Sri Lanka in August to deal with its COVID-19 situation.“During the Covid pandemic period, India kept its air space open for travel for specific and urgent medical needs of Sri Lanka.“With the easing of the situation in Sri Lanka, it may be opportune for us to work on connectivity initiatives like the Jaffna to Chennai flight, ferry services between Karaikal and Kankesanthurai and Dhanushkodi and Talaimanar and the Buddhist corridor with the new international airport at Kushinagar,” he said.Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa’s office said Shringla told him that India was looking forward to receiving the first pilgrim flight from Sri Lanka to the Kushinagar airport, a request made by Prime Minister Modi during the bilateral virtual summit held last year.Sri Lanka was looking forward to resuming tourism with India as it has always been the island nation’s top tourism source, the office added.In his remarks, Shringla said that in 2009, India commenced its housing project in Sri Lanka. Over time, this project has become an integral part of the bilateral development cooperation partnership.“Today, we are dedicating 1,235 houses in the third phase of the Indian Housing Project which is spread across the hill country,” he said.In 2009, the Sri Lankan government brought an end to the country’s civil war fought mainly in the north and east of the island nation with the killing of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE) chief Velupillai Prabhakaran.

04-10-2021||New Delhi||Sachin Tendulkar named in Pandora Papers||Legendary India batsman Sachin Tendulkar has been named in the Pandora Papers investigation that unmasks the covert owners of offshore companies, incognito bank accounts, private jets, yachts, mansions, and even artworks by Pablo Picasso, Banksy and other masters, by providing more information than what is usually available to law enforcement agencies and cash-strapped governments.The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) said people linked by the secret documents to offshore assets also include pop music diva Shakira, supermodel Claudia Schiffer and an Italian mobster known as "Lell the Fat One", besides Tendulkar.Tendulkar's attorney said the cricket player's investment is legitimate and has been declared to tax authorities.Shakira's attorney said the singer declared her companies, which the attorney said do not provide tax advantages.Schiffer's representatives said the supermodel correctly pays her taxes in the UK, where she lives.The ICIJ obtained the trove of more than 11.9 million confidential files and led a team of more than 600 journalists from 150 news outlets that spent two years sifting through them, tracking down hard-to-find sources and digging into court records and other public documents from dozens of countries.In most countries, it is not illegal to have assets offshore or to use shell companies to do business across national borders.Businesspeople who operate internationally say they need offshore companies to conduct their financial affairs.But these affairs often amount to shifting profits from high-tax countries, where they are earned, to companies that exist only on paper in low-tax jurisdictions. Using offshore shelters is especially controversial for political figures, because they can be used to keep politically unpopular or even illicit, the ICIJ said.

04-10-2021||Guwahati||Arrested Assam Congress MLA suspended from party||The Assam Congress on Monday suspended its MLA Sherman Ali Ahmed with immediate effect for “repeatedly violating” the party’s discipline, a senior leader said.  APCC president Bhupen Kumar Borah, by an order, suspended Ahmed from the Congress, party general secretary Bobbeeta Sharma said.Ahmed was arrested from his official residence on Saturday for allegedly making provocative remarks in reference to the recent eviction drive in Darrang district.The Kamrup District Chief Judicial Magistrate’s Court in Guwahati had on Sunday remanded him to two days’ police custody under relevant sections of the IPC.The Assam Pradesh Congress Committee had last week slapped a show-cause notice on the MLA for “communally provocative” statements ahead of the bypolls in the state, and sought a reply from him within three days.On Sunday, the Assam Congress Legislature Party (ACLP) unanimously recommended that the APCC take disciplinary action against Ahmed for “repeatedly violating party discipline”, a release said.Several organisations, including the All Assam Students Union (AASU) and Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), have filed complaints against the legislator for his remarks.The state’s ruling alliance partner, Asom Gana Parishad, born out of the Assam agitation, had organised protests at various places, including Dibrugarh, Barpeta, Mangaldoi, Dhemaji, Tezpur, Biswanath, Nalbari, Bongaigaon, Majuli and Morigaon, and burnt effigies of the Congress MLA.An eviction drive held last month at Gorukhuti in Darrang district passed off peacefully on the first day, but was conducted amid stiff resistance by locals on the second day, leaving two dead in police firing, including a 12-year-old boy.Over 20 people were injured in the melee.Ahmed reportedly made the “communal” remarks while reacting to assertions by some leaders of the BJP-led ruling alliance that the alleged encroachers in Sipajhar area of Darrang district had “killed” eight people in 1983 during the six-year-long Assam agitation.The MLA claimed that the eight people who died in the agitation were “not martyrs, but killers”, as they were involved in slaughtering others from the minority community of Sipajhar area, where Gorukhuti is located.He had purportedly said that “the attack” on the eight people was an act of “self defence” by the Muslim population of that area.

Usually, on the first day, not many students apply for admissions but it’s different this year, maybe because of the fear that they may not get an opportunity in the subsequent cut-off lists due to limited number of seats and high number of students scoring above 95 per cent,” he said.Giri also said that he has called the members of various committees to the college to get a hang of the process.“Teachers will be able to process the admissions under the subsequent cut-offs from their homes but since this is the first cut-off, the members of the various committees are functioning from the college,” he said.Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College principal Hem Chand Jain said the college has received 485 applications from aspirants since the commencement of the admission process.The college has sought perfect scores for admission to BSc(Honours) Computer Science.The course has 60 seats in total and till now, 16 applications have been received, Jain said.Like last year, the admissions are being done online due to the coronavirus pandemic.

04-10-2021||New Delhi||SC dismisses Supertech’s plea seeking modification of order to raze twin 40-storey towers||The Supreme Court Monday dismissed an application moved by Supertech Ltd seeking modification of direction to raze the realty firm’s twin 40-storey towers in Noida and allowing it to only partially demolish 224 flats of one tower along with its community area on the ground floor to conform with the building norms.The apex court said that grant of such a relief is in the nature of a review of the judgment of this court and in various decisions.The filing of applications styled as ‘miscellaneous applications’ or applications for clarifications in the guise for review cannot be countenanced, it emphasised.A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and B V Nagarathna said that there is no substance in the application filed by Supertech Ltd and hence it is dismissed.“The attempt in the miscellaneous applications is clearly to seek substantive modification of the judgement of this court. Such an attempt is not permissible in the miscellaneous applications,” the bench said.In its application, Supertech Ltd has said that due to the proximity of Tower-17 (Ceyane) with the other residential towers in its Emerald Court project, it cannot demolish the building by blowing through explosives and it would have to be done brick by brick.“The underlying basis of the proposed modifications is that if the same are allowed, it would save crores of resources from going to waste inasmuch as the applicant has already put materials worth crores of rupees in the construction of the Towers T-16 (Apex) and T-17 (Ceyane),” the company has said, while clarifying that it was not seeking review of August 31 order.On August 31, the top court had ordered the demolition of Supertech Ltd’s twin 40-storey towers under construction within three months for violation of building norms in “collusion” with NOIDA officials, holding that illegal construction has to be dealt with strictly to ensure compliance with the rule of law.The Noida authority had received a rap on its knuckles as the top court pointed out multiple incidents of collusion of its officials with the Supertech Ltd in the Emerald Court project and violations of norms by the realty major in construction of the twin towers.The top court had directed that the entire amount of home buyers be refunded with 12 per cent interest from the time of the booking and the RWA of Emerald Court project be paid Rs 2 crore for the harassment caused due to the construction of the twin towers, which would have blocked sunlight and fresh air to the existing residents of the housing project adjoining the national capital.The top court noted that the two towers together have 915 apartments and 21 shops.According to Supertech data given to the court earlier, of the 633 people who booked the flats initially, 133 have moved out to other projects, 248 have taken refunds and 252 home buyers still have bookings with the company in the project.

04-10-2021||Mumbai||Drugs probe: NCB searches cruise ship on its return to Mumbai, detains 8 people||The Narcotics Control Bureau detained eight people after searching a cruise ship on its return to Mumbai on Monday, two days after a drugs party onboard the vessel was busted off the city coast, an NCB official said.The NCB also found some documents and some material, suspected to be drugs, after an over six-hour-long search onboard the ship, the official said, without divulging any further details. The anti-drugs agency had on Saturday evening busted a drugs party on board the ship, of the Cordelia Cruises company, and arrested Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan and seven others, including two women. On Monday, the NCB got information that the ship returned to the city after two days. Hence, NCB officials including its zonal director Sameer Wankhede reached the cruise terminal and conducted searches onboard the vessel, the official said. The sleuths subsequently detained eight people and the latter were seen with travelling bags in their hands while they were being brought from the ship to the NCB's office here. After conducting searches on Monday, the NCB is likely to record the statement of the cruise ship manager and owner, the official said. On Saturday evening, an NCB team, led by Wankhede, had raided the ship based on a tip-off that a party was scheduled on board. The sleuths seized 13 gm of cocaine, 5 gm of MD, 21 gm of charas and 22 pills of Ecstasy and Rs 1.33 lakh, an official earlier said. During the raid, over 20 officials of the Mumbai NCB had boarded the ship posing as customers. There were 1,800 people on the ship, but after checking all were asked to go except the eight, including Aryan Khan, the official said. Besides Aryan Khan, the arrested accused were identified as Munmun Dhamecha, Arbaaz Merchant, Ismeet Singh, Mohak Jaswal, Gomit Chopra, Nupur Sarika, and Vikrant Chhokar, the official said. A special holiday court had earlier remanded Aryan Khan, Munmun Dhamecha and Arbaaz Merchant in the NCB's custody till Monday. The anti-drugs agency had kept a close watch on the cruise ship event for 15-20 days after receiving information that a drug party would be organised. After confirmation, the NCB conducted the raid on Saturday, officials earlier said. They had said the NCB may question officials of Delhi-based event management company Namas'cray, registered as Caneplus Trading Private Limited, and officials of the cruise company, Cordelia Cruises. The (Delhi-based) firm was tasked with the management of the event onboard Cordelia Cruises' Empress ship, which was supposed to take place from October 2 to October 4. All known organisers of the event are now under the scanner of the NCB, an official of the anti-drug agency earlier said. The cruise company in a statement on Sunday said it had nothing to do with the incident. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drugs-probe-ncb-searches-cruise-ship-on-its-return-to-mumbai-detains-8-people-320008

04-10-2021||Mumbai||After 18 months, schools reopen across Maharashtra for physical classes||Schools across Maharashtra resumed physical sessions for Classes 5 to 12 on Monday after being shut for over 18 months in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.Until now, schools were conducting physical classes only in those areas which were reporting relatively fewer Covid cases.Last month, Maharashtra’s School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad had announced that physical classes would resume in schools across the state and the government also issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) for it.On Monday morning, the minister in a tweet said, “Wishing all parents and students the very best as schools reopen across the state today. We hope you enjoy your first day back in a safe atmosphere.”  According to the Maharashtra government, physical sessions have started for classes 5 to 12 in rural areas and for classes 8 to 12 in urban areas of the state.But, the physical classes have not yet been resumed for Classes 1 to 4 in rural areas and for Classes 1 to 7 in urban areas.The Maharashtra Education Department conducted a meeting on Sunday to take stock of the situation before resuming physical classes in schools.“For a smooth transition to physical classes, effective coordination with the health department, local administration will have to be maintained. We are committed to providing a conducive atmosphere to students, many among whom will be returning to class after a year and a half,” Gaikwad had tweeted after the meeting.As per SOPs issued by the state government for the reopening of schools, it is not mandatory for students to attend physical classes. If they want to attend, they will have to submit consent letters from their parents.Gaikwad last month said that as per a survey conducted by the school education department, more than 70 per cent parents favoured reopening of schools.In Maharashtra, physical classes in schools were stopped in March 2020, after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.The state government in July this year allowed schools to restart physical classes in the rural areas where Covid-19 prevalence was negligible. The decision mainly benefited the state’s Vidarbha region, but schools in major cities like Mumbai and Pune remained closed.The latest decision was taken after consulting health officials as well as the state government’s Covid-19 task force, Gaikwad earlier said.

The pollution under control (PUC) will be strictly followed with formation of 500 teams to check the vehicles, he said.A total of 250 teams have been formed to enforce a ban on garbage burning in the city. Also, strengthening of green war rooms and a mass awareness campaign will be part of the winter action plan, Kejriwal said.The chief minister said following in the footsteps of Delhi, the NCR areas should also ensure use of CNG-operated vehicles, use of clean fuel in thermal plants and other industries, hotspot monitoring and round-the-clock power supply to prevent use of diesel generators.He said currently, air pollution is under control in Delhi but it will start rising with stubble burning in the neighbouring states in winters.

We never did this when we were in power. Then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi had reached Oberoi hotel in Mumbai during the 26/11 terror attack. Priyanka Vadra should be released. She was stopped at Hargaon on the border of Lakhimpur Kheri and sent back to Sitapur,” Shukla said accusing UP police of illegal detention of Vadra and Congress leaders.Shukla said the Congress would hold nationwide protests on Tuesday and demanded a high-level probe into the incident.Shukla reiterated the demand for dismissal of Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra after his son was accused of running the farmers over. The minister has denied charges.The Congress also questioned the UP government’s move of preventing the chief minister of Chhattisgarh and deputy CM of Punjab from landing in Lucknow.“Stopping political people from free movement in a democracy is unacceptable and illegal,” said Shukla, demanding compensation for the deceased farmers’ families.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-violence-congress-seeks-priyankas-release-to-protest-at-dc-offices-across-india-on-tuesday-319995

This test has to be within 30 days of the date of death.Where Covid cases were not resolved and where a person died at home or hospital will also be Covid death, if a family member satisfies the authority of cause of death as Covid, then no state shall deny benefit of Rs 50,000 on the grounds that the cause of death is not Covid in the death certificate, it said.The district authorities had to take remedial steps to have the cause of death corrected, it added.Grievance redressal committees can examine medical records of deceased patient and take a call within 30 days and order the compensation. Such committee will have the power to call for records from the hospitals, it said.It said the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Ministry of Health are directed to issue necessary guidelines for implementation of its directions by states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-issues-order-for-payment-of-rs-50-000-as-ex-gratia-to-families-of-covid-victims-319992

They are afraid of your fearlessness and courage.”As opposition leaders lined up for visits to the village, Vadra’s office released videos showing a showdown between the AICC general secretary and UP cops after she was detained.“You can’t treat me like this. Show me papers, a warrant. There is rule of law in this country. There may not be rule of law in UP,” Vadra said.In another video, Vadra is heard saying that the country belonged to farmers and not to the ideology of the BJP.“This country has been nurtured by farmers. It belongs to them. The very fact that the government has had to use force goes to show it has lost the moral right,” Vadra says from a moving vehicle while being taken to Sitapur.Uttar Pradesh is the “naya J&K”.  As politics on farmer issues escalated with the fresh round of violence in UP, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha will hold sit-ins at DC offices across India seeking dismissal of Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra, registration of murder charges against his son alleged to have been driving the vehicle that ran over four farmers killing them, and probe by a sitting Supreme Court judge.The larger opposition has also sought a judicial probe into the violence.Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath has asked people not to jump to conclusions and wait for the results of the investigation into the matter.With polls due in UP in a few months, the Lakhimpur Kheri incident could snowball into a major canvassing issue across the state, especially in western UP which holds the key to victory in UP.Among politicians heading to UP but stopped from going further to the violence-hit area are Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, Congress MP Deepender Hooda, BSP leader Satish Chandra Mishra, TMC delegation, RLD’s Jayant Chaudhary and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav.UP cops have suspended internet in the area and have appealed to locals to maintain peace even as SKM leader Rakesh Tikait reached the village amid indications of the matter snowballing into a huge poll issue over the coming days.The SKM is citing Lakhimpur violence and Haryana CM ML Khattar’s “remarks against farmers” as a reflection of the BJP’s “anti-farmer mindset”.The opposition is keen to capitalise on the highly emotive issue that can reconsolidate farmers who appear fatigued after a 10-month agitation against farm laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-violence-gandhis-up-the-ante-rahul-backs-priyankas-fearless-fight-319984

In the backdrop of the blasts, India and Sri Lanka enhanced their anti-terror cooperation.The seventh edition of the Mitra Shakti exercise was conducted at the Foreign Training Node (FTN) in Pune in 2019.

The records include information about the dealings of nearly three times as many current and former country leaders as any previous leak of documents from offshore havens."In an era of widening authoritarianism and inequality, the Pandora Papers investigation provides an unequaled perspective on how money and power operate in the 21st century – and how the rule of law has been bent and broken around the world by a system of financial secrecy enabled by the U.S. and other wealthy nations," an ICJ statement said.The analysis of the secret documents identified 956 companies in offshore havens tied to 336 high-level politicians and public officials, including country leaders, cabinet ministers, ambassadors and others.More than two-thirds of those companies were set up in the British Virgin Islands, a jurisdiction long known as a key cog in the offshore system.At least $11.3 trillion is held “offshore,” according to a 2020 study by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Because of the complexity and secrecy of the offshore system, it’s not possible to know how much of that wealth is tied to tax evasion and other crimes and how much of it involves funds that come from legitimate sources and have been reported to proper authorities, the ICJ added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biggest-offshore-data-leak-ever-reveals-hidden-wealth-of-high-and-mighty-icj-to-publish-details-319970

We have been prevented by the police from entering. We have come here to meet the victims of the violence," Congress national secretary Dheeraj Gurjar told PTI over the phone at 4.30 am.Gandhi's convoy was earlier briefly stopped by Uttar Pradesh Police officials in Lucknow, where the Congress general secretary had arrived on Sunday night, within a few hours of violence being reported during an anti-farm laws protest here.Demanding a judicial probe in the violence, BSP supremo Mayawati said her party's national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra was stopped in Lucknow to prevent him from reaching Lakhimpur."BSP's national general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP SC Mishra was placed under house arrest on Sunday night at his residence in Lucknow. It is continuing so that the party delegation under his leadership cannot reach Lakhimpur Kheri to get the correct report of the violence. This is very sad and deplorable," Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi."Due to the involvement of two BJP ministers in the Kheri case, a proper government investigation of this incident, justice to the victims and strict punishment to the guilty does not seem possible. Therefore, this incident in which eight people have been confirmed dead so far requires a judicial inquiry. This is the demand of the BSP," she said.Meanwhile, security has been beefed up outside the residence of Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav, who had announced that he would visit Lakhimpur.A large police force has been deployed on Vikramaditya Marg, and police trucks have been placed to block the entire road and restrict any possible movement.Mobile internet services have been suspended in parts of the violence-hit Lakhimpur district, where restrictions under CrPC section 144 -- which prohibits assembly of four or more people -- has also been imposed, according to officials.UP Police took to Twitter early on Monday to describe the incident as "unfortunate" and said eight casualties had been reported so far as per the district administration."ADG LO, ACS Agriculture, IG Range and Commissioner are on the spot and situation is under control. Adequate deployment has been done to prevent any untoward incident," it added.

In the quest for modernisation, man, driven by greed, has destroyed natural ecosystem and at several places, the water bodies have virtually disappeared or have been encroached upon,” he observed.The Vice-President, who arrived in Guwahati today on a North-East tour, began his trip by inaugurating the heritage-cum-cultural centre on the banks of the Brahmaputra.Noting the importance of rivers and their rejuvenation, Naidu suggested to the Centre and the state governments to include lessons on the importance of water conservation in school curricula.He also suggested that schools should conduct nature camps for students from a young age so that children, especially those living in the urban areas, see and enjoy the splendor of nature.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vice-president-calls-for-national-campaign-to-rejuvenate-rivers-319777

The document mentions the status of Covaxin’s assessment by the WHO as “ongoing” and the decision date as “October 2021”.The decision on Covaxin’s WHO EUL could be expected sooner than later with the global health body’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE), which decides on such applications, meeting for four days starting Monday.WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan today said, “There is a lot of interest in vaccine policy and authorisation process. All vaccine dossiers submitted to the WHO go through both SAGE — which is meeting on October 4 to 7 for policy guidance and technical advisory group, which is also meeting this month for EUL or pre qualification.”The SAGE develops evidence-based policy recommendations for the best use of vaccines against Covid-19.It continuously reviews the available evidence on the progress of candidate vaccines, guides vaccine introduction for optimal impact, prepares policy advice on the accelerated use of vaccines (pre-licensure and post-licensure) and recommendations for early allocation of vaccines when vaccine supply is still limited.So far, the WHO has included six vaccines in its EUL. These are Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, SII-AstraZeneca, Moderna, Sinopharm and Sinovac.Bharat Biotech, the makers of Covaxin, meanwhile said as responsible manufacturers with past approvals to other vaccines, the firm is working with the WHO to obtain EUL at the earliest.

Voters have given a befitting reply to the conspiracy hatched against me in Nandigram. — Mamata Banerjee, Bengal Chief MinisterBanerjee secured 85,263 votes against 26,428 polled by Tibrewal. This is the third consecutive victory for the TMC chief from Bhabanipur and her biggest win from the seat till date. The victory will ensure that she continues to occupy the CM’s post. Having suffered defeat at the hand of BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari at Nandigram in the Assembly elections, Banerjee needed to win the election to retain the post.After the results, she said not only Bengal but people from all over the country were watching the outcome of the bypoll with interest.Claiming that 46 per cent of the electorate in Bhabanipur comprised non-Bengalis, Banerjee said she had secured more votes than her rivals in all wards of the constituency. “Bhabanipur is a small constituency with enormous diversity,” she said.Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, who had won the seat and later resigned to pave the way for the bypoll, would now be the party candidate in the Khardaha byelection, which will take place on October 30.BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar, while congratulating Banerjee, said it was doubtful how much the result reflected the mood of the voters since the turnout was just 57 per cent in Bhabanipur.In Odisha, ruling BJD’s candidate Rudra Pratap Maharathy won the Pipili bypoll, defeating his nearest rival Ashrit Pattnaik of the BJP by over 20,000 votes.Maharathy secured 96,972 votes, while Pattnaik bagged 76,056.

The commission, assigned the task of redrawing constituencies, is learnt to have sought the services of the Survey of India (SoI) for remapping the Assembly segments.Sources close to the development told The Tribune that new districts, tehsils and blocks, constituted earlier, were not demarcated properly.

This was followed by the creation of several new administrative units, including tehsils, subdivisions and blocks, by the National Conference-Congress coalition led by Omar Abdullah.As no delimitation of the Assembly constituencies was held thereafter, the administrative units kept functioning with dual control in different districts keeping the electorate in confusion. People living in one district were considered the electorate of an Assembly constituency falling in another district.“The mapping will ensure that new constituencies are confined within the districts and their areas don’t overlap in other districts,” the source said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jk-delimitation-exercise-hits-hurdle-319768

Agarwal, a single parent with some medical issues, alleged that due to blockades enforced by agitating farmers, travelling between Noida and Delhi was taking two hours instead of the usual 20 minutes and that it had become a nightmare to commute between Noida and Delhi.Earlier, in an affidavit filed in the top court, the Haryana Government had said it was making “sincere” efforts to remove the blockade for resumption of free flow of traffic. The UP Government had also filed a similar affidavit stating that it was making all efforts to convince farmers that their act of blocking roads was causing grave inconvenience to commuters.The Haryana Government said a state-level committee headed by the Additional Chief Secretary was formed to find a way out. The panel’s September 19 meeting wasn’t attended by the farmers’ leaders.As farmers continued to block key roads connecting Delhi to NCR, the Supreme Court had on September 30 wondered how highways could be blocked perpetually and made it clear that it was the duty of the executive to implement the law laid down by it.“The redressal of problems can be through judicial forum, agitation or through parliamentary debates. But how can the highways be blocked and this is happening perpetually. Where does this end?” a Bench led by Justice SK Kaul had asked.On October 1, another Bench of the top court had questioned the rationale behind blocking roads even after approaching the judiciary and reminded the agitating farmers that citizens had equal rights to move freely without fear.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/haryana-wants-43-farm-leaders-made-party-to-pil-on-road-blockades-319765

The minister termed the incident a conspiracy alleging that certain elements among protesters threw stones at the vehicles, which overturned.The minister alleged that three BJP workers and a driver were beaten to death by some elements in the protests and warned against “peaceful farmers’ protests being hijacked”.At a press conference later in the evening, SKM leaders Darshan Pal and Yogendra Yadav, however, claimed that the SUV being driven by the minister’s son ran over farmers, “killing four and injuring over a dozen.”The SKM rejected the claims of violence by farmers, demanding the dismissal of Mishra, registration of murder cases against the perpetrators and investigation of the incident by a sitting Supreme Court judge. The SKM’s demand was supported by the Congress, Rashtriya Lok Dal and Samajwadi Party.Yogendra Yadav, meanwhile, said that SKM wanted the probe to be held outside Uttar Pradesh. “We also call upon the farmers across India to hold protests outside DC offices from 10 am to 1 pm tomorrow and seek justice. We appeal for peace,” Yadav said, appealing to farmers for calm even as another farm leader Rakesh Tikait said he was on the way to the spot. The incident occurred after farmers gathered along Tikonia-Banbirpur road to protest the visit of Deputy CM Maurya. The protesters had gathered at the helipad where Maurya was to arrive. They later dispersed after cops said the Deputy CM had taken another route. SKM’s Darshan Pal alleged that Mishra had been making provocative statements against Punjabi farmers inhabiting the Terai region. Another morcha member, Guramneet Mangat said, “The son and brother of minister Ajay Mishra came to the spot in speeding vehicles. They fired, and then ran over some farmers. One of the farmers, Tejinder Virk, is critical.”The Congress demanded the sacking of Mishra. “At whose behest was the trampling done? A committee led by a sitting Supreme Court judge should probe it and identify those who burnt the vehicles and those who crushed the farmers. The SC should also take suo motu cognisance of the incident,” Congress spokesman Gaurav Vallabh said.Khattar’s video triggers rowChandigarh: A video purportedly showing Haryana CM ML Khattar asking his audience to take on protesting farmers went viral on Sunday. The government claimed the CM’s statement had been distorted. “If the entire video is viewed, the context becomes clear. This is a meeting of BJP workers where the CM says they should maintain discipline even while opposing wrongdoings,” a party spokesperson said. — TNSHow the incident unfoldedGhastly & inhumanGhastly and inhuman, must be condemned by all in strongest possible words.

He, too, would have been lynched had he been in the car,” he said.The Union minister said his car was being driven by his driver and had three other BJP karyakartas travelling, who were also killed in the incident.“The vehicle was pelted with stones by miscreants who hid amid the protesting farmers. The car overturned because of that and two farmers came underneath it. The driver and the karyakartas were then pulled out and beaten to death. The car was set on fire. The entire incident is a conspiracy,” he accused.His son would fully cooperate with the police in the investigation, Mishra assured, while claiming that the protestors were outsiders since the two farmers, who died were identified as “residents of Nanpara area of Bahraich and not from Lakhimpur”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-kheri-incident-a-conspiracy-claims-mos-home-ajay-mishra-319650

The company has been asked to reconsider all the aspects regarding the cost of the vaccine. A final decision on the price of the vaccine is likely to be taken this week,” a source said.Another source said the ZyCoV-D has to be differently priced than Covaxin and Covishield as, apart from being a three-dose vaccine, there is a needle-free jet injector used for administering the vaccine that costs Rs 30,000.That jet injector can be used for administering around 20,000 doses.The vaccine is to be given on days zero, 28 and 56.According to sources, around three rounds of meetings have taken place so far between the Centre and the company, the last one on Thursday.Meanwhile, the ministry is also waiting for the recommendations from the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI ) for introducing ZyCoV-D in the inoculation drive and prioritising beneficiaries focusing on those aged 12-18 years with comorbidities.The NTAGI will provide the protocol and framework for the introduction of this vaccine in the Covid-19 immunisation drive, an official source said.As far as the price of the vaccine at which it will be procured is concerned, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan, at a press conference on Thursday, said the government is in conversation with the manufacturers.“Since this is a three-dose vaccine and comes with a needleless delivery system, it would have a differential pricing than the existing vaccines which are being used in the Covid vaccination programme,” he said.The vaccine ZyCoV-D received Emergency Use Authorisation from the drug regulator on August 20 making it the first vaccine to be administered in the age-group of 12 to 18 besides adults.Vaccines Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V are being given to only those above 18 years of age and unlike ZyCoV-D, these are two-dose vaccines.

04-10-2021||New Delhi||Google removes 93,550 content pieces in August in India, shows compliance report||Google received 35,191 complaints from users and removed 93,550 pieces of content based on those complaints in the month of August, the tech giant said in its monthly transparency report.In addition to reports from users, Google also removed 651,933 pieces of content in August as a result of automated detection.Google had received 36,934 complaints from users and removed 95,680 pieces of content based on those complaints in July. It had removed 5,76,892 pieces of content in July as a result of automated detection.The US-based company has made these disclosures as part of compliance with India’s IT rules that came into force on May 26.Google, in its latest report, said it had received 35,191 complaints in August from individual users located in India via designated mechanisms, and the number of removal actions as a result of user complaints stood at 93,550.These complaints relate to third-party content that is believed to violate local laws or personal rights on Google’s significant social media intermediaries (SSMI) platforms, the report said.“Some requests may allege infringement of intellectual property rights, while others claim violation of local laws prohibiting types of content on grounds such as defamation. When we receive complaints regarding content on our platforms, we assess them carefully,” it added.The content removal was done under several categories, including copyright (92,750), trademark (721), counterfeit (32), circumvention (19), court order (12), graphic sexual content (12) and other legal requests (4).Google explained that a single complaint may specify multiple items that potentially relate to the same or different pieces of content, and each unique URL in a specific complaint is considered an individual “item” that is removed.Google said in addition to reports from users, the company invests heavily in fighting harmful content online and use technology to detect and remove it from its platforms.“This includes using automated detection processes for some of our products to prevent the dissemination of harmful content such as child sexual abuse material and violent extremist content.“We balance privacy and user protection to: quickly remove content that violates our Community Guidelines and content policies; restrict content (e.g., age-restrict content that may not be appropriate for all audiences); or leave the content live when it doesn’t violate our guidelines or policies,” it added.Google said automated detection enables it to act more quickly and accurately to enforce its guidelines and policies. These removal actions may result in removing the content or terminating a bad actor’s access to the Google service, it added.Under the new IT rules, large digital platforms—with over 5 million users—will have to publish periodic compliance reports every month, mentioning the details of complaints received and action taken thereon.The report needs to also include the number of specific communication links or parts of the information that the intermediary has removed or disabled access to in pursuance of any proactive monitoring conducted by using automated tools.Recently, Facebook and WhatsApp have also released their compliance reports for the month of August.Facebook said it had “actioned” about 31.7 million content pieces across 10 violation categories proactively during August in the country, while its photo sharing platform, Instagram took action against about 2.2 million pieces across nine categories during the same period proactively.“Actioned” content refers to the number of pieces of content (such as posts, photos, videos or comments) where action has been taken for violation of standards. Taking action could include removing a piece of content from Facebook or Instagram or covering photos or videos that may be disturbing to some audiences with a warning.Also, Facebook said it had received 904 user reports for Facebook through its Indian grievance mechanism between August 1 and 31. Instagram had received 106 reports through the Indian grievance mechanism during the same time frame.In its report, WhatsApp said it had banned over two million accounts in India, while 420 grievance reports were received by the messaging platform in the month of August. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/google-removes-93-550-content-pieces-in-august-in-india-shows-compliance-report-319588
04-10-2021||New Delhi||TMC bags all three seats as Mamata Banerjee wins big from Bhabanipur||The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) of West Bengal has bagged all three assembly seats in the state that went to polls on September 30.While Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee defeated BJP’s Priyanka Tibrewal by a record margin of 58,000 votes in Bhabanipur, TMC nominees Amirul Islam won from Samserganj and Jakir Hossain from Jangipur.Election in Samserganj and Jangipur could not take place at the time of general elections owing to the death of candidates.Mamata got 85,263 votes as against 26,428 votes secured by Tibrewal. Shrijeeb Biswas, CPI(M) candidate,  polled 4,226 votes and lost his security deposit. This is the third consecutive victory from Bhabanipur by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo and also her biggest win from the seat till date. Her previous best was the victory margin of 54,000 votes in 2011 when she won byelection from the seat after being sworn in as chief minister.The latest contest – result of which was announced today – was once again a bypoll as Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay,  TMC nominee who had won the seat in the assembly elections held earlier this year, resigned from the Assembly to pave the way for Mamata to contest from Bhabanipur.Mamata today announced that Sobhandeb will be the party candidate from Khardaha where byelection will take place on October 30.Victory at Bhabanipur will ensure that Banerjee continues to occupy the chair of the chief minister. Having suffered defeat at the hand of BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari at Nandigram in the assembly elections, Mamata needed to become an MLA by November 5 to remain chief minister.The big margin of Banerjee’s victory emboldened TMC leaders to speak openly about their dream to see Banerjee as prime minister.Firhad Hakim, transport and housing minister, said Bhabanipur with its motley electorate was like a “mini-India”.“Victory of Mamata Banerjee from Bhabanipur by record margin is a signal that she can no more be confined in Bengal as the people of India want to see her as the face of coalition of forces against Modi,” Hakim said.Attacking Congress, Hakim said Congress party may have its own idea about who will be the PM in case BJP is defeated but people have already accepted Mamata as one who is Modi’s main rival.Mamata said that not only Bengal, but also people in the rest of the country were watching with interest the outcome of the bypoll in Bhabanipur.Claiming that 46 per cent of the electorate in Bhabanipur consisted of people who were not Bengalis, Banerjee told the media persons in Kolkata that she had secured more votes than her rivals in all the wards of the constituency.“Bhabanipur is a small constituency with enormous diversity,” Banerjee said.BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar, while congratulating Banerjee on her victory, said it was doubtful how much the result reflected the mood of the voters since only 57 per cent of the electorate at Bhabanipur cast their votes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-bags-all-three-seats-as-mamata-banerjee-wins-big-from-bhabanipur-319562
