We assume that the kids must have consumed or done something. All I want to say is that the process is on, let’s give that child a breather,” he said.“Whenever there is something related to Bollywood, the entire media starts reacting on every angle and assumes that everyone is like that. I think the child should be given an opportunity and let the real reports come out. Till then, he is a child and I think he is our responsibility,” he added.Aryan Khan was among eight people who were detained by the NCB after it raided the cruise ship, which was headed to Goa, on Saturday evening.Later, he was arrested by the agency in connection with the seizure of banned drugs from the ship. He was sent to NCB custody till Monday by a special court in Mumbai.Aryan Khan has been booked under sections 27 (punishment for consumption of any narcotic drug or psychotropic substance), 8C (produce, manufacture, possess, sell or purchase of drugs) and other relevant provisions of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.His advocate Satish Maneshinde said he would file a bail application on Monday.

Some of them were run over, while fire was also opened on them. According to the information we have so far, several people have died in the incident,” Tikait said in a purported video message he posted on Twitter.The violence broke out after two SUVs allegedly ran over a group of anti-farm law protesters who were demonstrating against the visit of Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya at Tikonia-Banbirpur road in Lakhimpur Kheri district, some 130 km off state capital Lucknow.Unconfirmed reports claimed a number of farmers were seriously injured in the incident. Angry protesters allegedly forced the two vehicles to stop and set them on fire. They also allegedly thrashed some passengers. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bkus-rakesh-tikait-leaves-for-lakhimpur-kheri-where-farmers-protest-turned-violent-319647
03-10-2021||Patna||Tej Pratap Yadav alleges Lalu being held captive in Delhi, Tejashwi dismisses claim||RJD president Lalu Prasad’s maverick elder son Tej Pratap Yadav has caused a flutter with the claim that his father was being held “captive” and prevented from returning to Bihar despite having been released from jail.Yadav, who is known for shooting from the hip, made the comment on Saturday when he said the captors of his father, who is convalescing in Delhi since release from Ranchi jail a few months ago, were “four or five people” he did not wish to name.Yadav, who is in his late 70s and suffers from multiple ailments, had been awarded sentences by a special CBI court in fodder scam cases. Since his release from jail on bail, he has been putting up at his Delhi residence, staying away from the daily humdrum of politics.Nonetheless, he has addressed RJD workers over video conferences on a couple of occasions.The BJP predictably latched on to Tej Pratap Yadav’s utterances, insisting that the elder sibling was hinting at Tejashwi, his younger brother and the heir apparent to Prasad.Party spokesmen Nikhil Anand and Arvind Kumar Singh came out with statements asserting that political differences notwithstanding, they had “immense respect” for Prasad and demanding that Tejashwi come clean on the issue.Tejashwi, who incidentally returned from the national capital on Sunday morning, was mobbed by journalists seeking his take on yet another embarrassment thrown at him by his elder sibling.The confident 32-year-old dismissed the contention with disdain asserting that “to say Lalu is bandhak (in captivity) simply does not go with his personality. He is a man who has served as the chief minister of Bihar and the country’s railway minister. He was the one who had got LK Advani arrested”.Tejashwi’s comment was a reference to Yadav’s tenure as CM when he had famously got the BJP stalwart arrested at Samastipur, causing the Ayodhya Rath Yatra to stop.Notably, both brothers had made their debut together in the 2015 assembly polls. However, Tejashwi, known to be the favourite of his father, was installed as the deputy CM in the Nitish Kumar government while the elder brother had to be content with a cabinet berth.After Kumar parted ways with the RJD, Tejashwi became the leader of the opposition while the elder sibling alternated between throwing tantrums and swearing full support to the younger brother whom he frequently likens to Mahabharata character Arjuna while calling himself Krishna, the warrior prince’s charioteer-cum-counsel.The latest showdown came barely a month ago when, angered over the removal of a trusted aide from the post of the RJD students’ wing chief, Tej Pratap Yadav reacted by floating a parallel outfit.He also lashed out at state RJD chief Jagadanand Singh, seen as Tejashwi’s man, referring to him as ‘Hitler’.The mercurial leader’s outrage received thumbs down from the party supremo himself who lauded Singh for being a “disciplinarian” when he addressed RJD workers a few days later. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tej-pratap-yadav-alleges-lalu-being-held-captive-in-delhi-tejashwi-dismisses-claim-319644
03-10-2021||Chandigarh||Centre has got positive help from Punjab, Haryana, UP, Delhi on stubble burning: Union Environment Minister||The Centre has got constructive cooperation from Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh governments on the issue of stubble burning, Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said on Sunday.Yadav had held a key meeting last month with the governments of Delhi and its neighbouring states Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan on the action plan to mitigate air pollution caused by stubble burning.Yadav, who is also the minister for Forest and Climate Change and Labour and Employment, said on the issue of pollution caused by stubble burning, the Centre has got constructive cooperation from these northern states.He said discussions were held last month over the implementation of action plans by states to mitigate pollution due to agriculture stubble burning, dust, construction and demolition waste, and vehicular pollution.The minister, while interacting with reporters here, said with technologies available now, there was economic viability of stubble nowadays.The state-run NTPC had earlier floated a tender to buy farm stubble for use as fuel at power plants, he said.Some private companies too have come up with good experiments under which stubble or crop residue is turned into manure, said the minister.Touching upon the issue of machines needed to deal with stubble, Yadav said the Union Agriculture Ministry has given nearly Rs 700 crore to these northern states.Notably, farmers in Punjab, Haryana and some other states set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue left after harvesting and before cultivating wheat and potato.Experts have claimed it is one of the main reasons for the spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR at the onset of winters.The paddy harvesting season is between October 15 and November 15.In the country’s 132 cities, equipment to monitor air quality has been set up, he said.Replying to a question on climate change, Yadav said it is a global challenge.India recognises the urgency of strong climate action to stay within the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, he said.Yadav also said India has taken many steps on clean energy, energy efficiency and biodiversity.He said the country has set an ambitious renewable energy target of 450 Gigawatts by 2030.Earlier, addressing an event at the Shram Bureau (Labour Bureau) Bhavan here, Yadav said following the motto of “Mehnat Ko Samman, Adhikar Ek Saman”, the Government is focused on the welfare of workers through evidence-based policymaking.During the event, he mentioned that data on all aspects of labour is crucial and scientifically collected data is the bedrock for any evidence-based policymaking.With the increasing importance of data in the time to come, coupled with the fact that India is a labour abundant nation, a dedicated organisation for labour and price statistics like the Labour Bureau merits strengthening and full support, said the minister.The Union Minister further said over the years, the Labour Bureau mandate has increased exponentially which now includes the collection and compilation of data on all possible aspects of labour.On the occasion, certificates of appreciation were also given to many of the Bureau officials.The minister also held discussions with the state labour ministers, labour secretaries & commissioners of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh & UTs of Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh on progress in the registration of unorganised workers on the e-Shram portal and preparedness of the states and UTs on the implementation of various schemes and reforms, an official statement said.The Minister also visited a special camp for the registration of unorganised workers under “e-Shram” portal organised by the office of chief labour commissioner (Central) under the Union Ministry of Labour & Employment.The minister distributed e-Shram cards to unorganised workers and had an interaction with trade union leaders, employers and unorganised workers.The e-Shram portal was inaugurated on August 26. The portal is the first-ever national database of unorganised workers including migrant workers and construction workers.An estimated 38 crore workers are engaged in the unorganized sector and employment (Economic Survey, 2019-20), Yadav said.As of October 2, 2021, a total of 2,46,57,524 workers have registered on the portal.Of these almost 55 per cent of the workers are engaged in the agriculture sector followed by almost 15 per cent registration from the workers in the construction sector and six per cent in the apparel industry.

03-10-2021||Satya Prakash||Haryana seeks to make farmer leaders parties to PIL seeking removal of blockades||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 3Ahead of Monday’s hearing on a PIL seeking removal of blockades at key roads connecting Delhi to NCR regions by farmers demanding repeal of farm laws, the Haryana government has moved the Supreme Court to make 43 officer-bearers of farmers’ organisations parties to it.In an application filed in the top court, the Haryana government has sought to implead farmer leaders Rakesh Tikait, Yogendra Yadav, Darshan Pal, Gurnam Singh and others to the ongoing proceedings.Maintaining that the Dharna on Singhu and Tikri borders was being organised by Samyukt Kisan Morcha—a body of number of Kisan unions – Haryana government said the names of parties mentioned in its plea were those of the office bearer/workers of various Kisan unions.The top court is hearing a petition filed by Monicca Agarwal—a women resident of NOIDA – on the issue. Agarwal—a single parent with some medical issues—alleged that due to blockades enforced by agitating farmers travelling between NOIDA and Delhi was taking two hours instead of the usual 20 minutes and that it had become a nightmare to commute between Noida and Delhi.Earlier, in an affidavit filed in the top court, he Haryana Government had said it’s making “sincere” efforts to remove the blockade for resumption of free flow of traffic. The UP government had also filed a similar affidavit stating that it’s making all efforts to convince farmers that their act of blocking roads was causing grave inconvenience to commuters.Giving details of its efforts, the Haryana Government said a state-level committee headed by the Additional Chief Secretary was formed to find a way out. The panel’s September 19 meeting wasn’t attended by the farmers’ leaders.As farmers continued to block key roads connecting Delhi to NCR regions, the Supreme Court had on September 30 wondered how highways can be blocked perpetually and made it clear that it’s the duty of the executive to implement the law laid down by it.“The redressal of problems can be through judicial forum, agitation or through parliamentary debates. But how can the highways be blocked and this is happening perpetually. Where does this end?” a Bench led by Justice SK Kaul had asked.“We may lay down a law but how to implement the law is your (the government’s) business. The court can’t implement it. It is the Executive which has to implement it,” it had noted.On October 1, another Bench of the top court had questioned the rationale behind blocking roads even after approaching the judiciary and reminded the agitating farmers that citizens had equal rights to move freely without fear.“You have strangulated the entire city, now you want to come inside the city and start protesting again here… The residents around... are they happy with the protest? This business should stop. You are obstructing security and defence personnel. This was in the media. All this should stop…There has to be a balanced approach,” a Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar had said.The Bench was hearing Kisan Mahapanchayat’s plea seeking directions to the Centre, Delhi Lt. Governor and Delhi Police Commissioner to allow them to hold dharna at Jantar Mantar in the capital.Both the matters are listed for hearing on Monday.Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the top court had on October 7, last year ruled that roads and public spaces can’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.The top court had on August 23 asked the Centre and governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to find a solution to the blockade of roads connecting Delhi with NCR towns by farmers agitating against the three farm laws.The farmers have a right to protest at a designated space, but they can’t block the traffic, a Bench had said. “The solution lies in the hands of the Union of India and state governments...Mr Mehta what is happening? You have to find a solution, they might have the right to a place to agitate, but the roads can’t be blocked like this.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/haryana-seeks-to-make-farmer-leaders-parties-to-pil-seeking-removal-of-blockades-319636

But not scared of the threat, the protesting farmers occupied the helipad where the minister was supposed to land. In protest, the minister’s son and his close aides came in cars and mowed down farmers. At least 10 farmers are seriously injured, besides the three who have died,” he alleged.The BKU leader said their message to the farmers was clear – “BJP is not with us, but we are with our country”. “We are asking them not to take law in their own hands. We demand that an FIR on charges of homicide be registered against the minister and his aides and a sitting judge of the Supreme Court conduct an investigation into the incident. The minister should be immediately sacked by the BJP government,” he demanded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhimpur-kheri-incident-samyukt-kisan-morcha-appeals-to-farmers-to-maintain-peace-319635

03-10-2021||New Delhi||Can’t resist watching IPL, KBC: Indra Nooyi||Former PepsiCo boss Indra Nooyi says she may have departed India 43 years ago but India has never left he: she performs puja everyday and among other things, can’t resist watching IPL cricket, Indian movies and TV shows ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’ and ‘Indian Idol’.She has come out with her memoir ‘My Life in Full: Work, Family, and Our Future’, in which she recounts the events that shaped her, from her childhood and early education in 1960s India, to the Yale School of Management, to her rise as a corporate leader.These remarks about her interests find mention in the epilogue written especially for the Indian audience.Published by Hachette India, the book offers a blueprint for 21st century prosperity, peppered with masterful insights.“I departed India 43 years ago, but India has never left me. I am still a vegetarian; I don’t smoke or drink alcohol beyond a few sips of wine; I have a puja alcove in my home where I light my lamp every day - and, as much as I love the New York Yankees and American TV shows, I can’t resist watching IPL cricket, Kaun Banega Crorepati, Indian movies and Indian Idol,” she writes.“They all bring me home to my wonderful upbringing in Madras, and to the energy and rhythms that are so familiar and precious to me,” she adds.Nooyi finds these shows acting as a window into how India has changed since she was a teenager who dared play Nancy Sinatra’s “These Boots are Made for Walkin” in a rock ‘n’ roll band.She writes that today’s popular media features characters and performers who are strong, educated and determined women making their way in the world, and these shows help young girls understand how they, too, have a voice and can dream of forging an independent life.She also says that she sees plenty of women playing traditional roles that were the norm many decades ago, both on TV and in real life.“They are deferential, attentive, taking care of everyone, engaged in unpaid labour. I’m reminded that, when it comes to women, India has one foot in the future and one foot in the past,” she writes.As Nooyi traced her journey while writing this book, she says, she was in awe of how India has passed so many “intelligent laws to protect its citizens”, and how many of these focus on women.But, she adds that she then ran into a few more facts like women accounting for only 20 per cent of the paid labour force in India, a figure that has fallen by 30 per cent in the last 20 years.“Women do almost 10 times more unpaid domestic work than men. Although girls are increasingly outperforming boys in school and women now make almost half of college graduates, they fill far fewer entry-level professional jobs,” she writes.Nooyi says she believes that all women deserve the power to earn money, for their own sake, and for the sake of their children, their communities, and the good of the whole society.She, however, rues that statistics reveal the gap between the law and reality.“The needle will only move if leadership at all levels commits to improving the situation for all women, including timely justice for those who have often been left behind in rural India and in unorganised sectors of the economy,” the epilogue says.Nooyi is of the opinion that as India emerges from the devastating impact of Covid, it must rethink some of its economic priorities under the umbrella of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.“I hope whole new ecosystems around next-generation industries emerge, and new investments in core infrastructure, including roads, the railways, water and sanitation, and healthcare,” she writes.When Nooyi took over as CEO of PepsiCo, one of her pivotal and controversial ideas was to steer the iconic American company toward healthier products and reinvent its environmental profile.The strategy met with immense backlash from some shareholders who wouldn’t stand for anything that affected the company’s short-term profitability targets.In the book, Nooyi also narrates a particular conversation in the face of tremendous resistance. When she pitched the revolutionary strategy to introduce healthy products, she was asked if she was Mother Teresa.For a dozen years as one of the world’s most admired CEOs, Nooyi redefined what it means to be an exceptional leader. She has been consistently ranked in Forbes’s ‘The World’s 100 Most Powerful Women’, Fortune’s ‘Most Powerful Women’ and was twice named on TIME magazine’s list of the ‘100 Most Influential People in the World’. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-resist-watching-ipl-kbc-indra-nooyi-319613

The Chinese troops returned from the area after spending few hours, people familiar with the development had said.There was no official comment on the Chinese transgression.The incident came amid a continuing standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in a number of areas in eastern Ladakh though both sides completed disengagement in two sensitive locations.The Chinese side has also significantly ramped up infrastructure development along the LAC in the sector.India has been maintaining a strict vigil along the nearly 3,500-km LAC following the eastern Ladakh standoff.The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year in eastern Ladakh following a violent clash in the Pangong lake area. Both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.In February, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in line with an agreement on disengagement.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.Gandhi and his Congress party have been attacking the government over alleged Chinese incursions in Ladakh.

Before that there were headlines about drug case linked to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Actress Rhea Chakroborty’s arrest in the case was another big breaking that rattled the Bollywood industry.

A no-nonsense officer, it is said that he handled many tax-evading celebrities and made the most uncooperative stars follow rules.From stopping his juniors to run behind actors at the airport for autographs to being stringent about checking their luggage and even stopping them at the custom area until they revealed their purchase, he made Mumbai airport more than a spot to capture celeb travel stories.During his posting Maharashtra Service Tax department, Wankhede is known to have booked over 2,500 people, of whom 200 were celebrities, for escaping tax payments.

Diesel rates too touched a record high of Rs 90.77 in Delhi and Rs 98.48 in Mumbai.Prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes.Petroleum Secretary Tarun Kapoor said oil companies are taking their own decision on aligning retail rates with the cost but they are ensuring extreme volatility is avoided.“We are watching the situation and trying to ensure the impact of global volatility is moderated to a large extent,” he said.The basket of crude oil India buys has jumped to a near three-year high of USD 76.71 per barrel. International prices of petrol, against which local rates are benchmarked, have risen from USD 85.10 per barrel to USD 87.11 in just one day while diesel has gone up from USD 85.95 a barrel to USD 87.27.This sudden spike in international oil prices follows global output disruptions but the entire increase in retail rates necessitated by such an increase is not being effected, another official with direct knowledge of the matter said.“Just look at LPG rates. They have gone up from USD 665 to USD 797 in one month but oil companies haven’t passed on the increase warranted from that,” he said adding state-owned companies were absorbing a lot of volatility.The increases, he said, have been “mild to moderate”.“Some people are making a big deal out of the 62 per cent hike in natural gas prices. But if you look at the rates previously at USD 1.79 per million British thermal unit were abnormally low and way below cost. They have now gone up to USD 2.9. They still are less than the cost of production of USD 3.5 per mmBtu and are certainly lower than the USD 4.2 price that was prevalent in India a decade back,” the official said.Naturally, the hike in natural gas price will warrant an increase in CNG price but the increase is again being moderated there too, he said adding internationally the price of LNG in the spot market last week soared to an unprecedented USD 35.“Compare to what is happening worldwide, we have managed the situation well,” the official said. “Some of the developed nations such as the UK have seen petrol pumps go dry but you won’t have heard of such a situation anywhere in India. Our oil companies are not just moderating retail prices but also ensuring uninterrupted supplies.”     Officials said India believes the situation internationally is temporary and abnormal and things should stabilise over the next few days and weeks.The fifth increase in its rates in less than a week’s time has sent petrol prices above Rs 100 in most major cities of the country.Similarly, the eighth increase in prices in 10 days has shot up diesel rates above Rs 100 mark in several cities in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) resumed daily price revisions on September 24 after international oil prices neared a three-year high. Global benchmark Brent crude is trading above USD 78 per barrel.In eight price increases since September 24, diesel rates have gone up by 2.15 paise per litre. Petrol price has increased by Rs 1.25 per litre in five instalments this week.When international oil rates fell in July and August, retail prices of petrol and diesel in the Delhi market were reduced by Rs 0.65 and Rs 1.25 per litre.Prior to that, the petrol price was increased by Rs 11.44 a litre between May 4 and July 17. Diesel rate had gone up by Rs 9.14 during this period.India is dependent on imports to meet nearly 85 per cent of its oil needs and so benchmarks local fuel rates to international oil prices.

There are parties which will make grand promises before elections, even mention these in their manifestos. But when the time comes to deliver on the promises, these parties make a U-turn and worse, spread malicious misinformation. The same people (Congress-led UPA) wrote letters to CMs to do the exact same thing that the NDA government has done.”Prime Minister Modi reiterated his government’s commitment to empowering small farmers. “The government has been saying from the beginning it is ready to discuss points of disagreement. Many meetings have been held but no one till today has come up with a specific point of disagreement,” the PM said, a day after Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi urged him to scrap the farm laws.He accused the Opposition of showing the same dishonesty “when it comes to Aadhaar, GST and even crucial matters such as arming our security forces.”‘Miss genuine critics’The PM said he looked forward to healthy criticism, but missed genuine critics. “When a person views anything with a preconceived mindset, he creates a perception accordingly,” he said, adding that the number of genuine critics was abysmally low.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-slams-oppositions-political-dishonesty-on-agriculture-laws-319406

Read also:Expressing gratitude to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi for agreeing to his “personal request” Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Channi said the decision will help in ensuring smooth and hassle free procurement of paddy to the satisfaction of the farmers.“On Chief Minister Charanjit Channi’s request, Centre allows Punjab to start paddy procurement from October 3. The Chief Minister thanks Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his personal indulgence to resolve this issue expeditiously,” the Punjab CMO tweeted.The Punjab Chief Minister met PM Modi yesterday, who “assured him of early resolution of this issue”.Farmers in Punjab and Haryana today held protests at many places against postponing paddy procurement, prompting the Centre to hasten the process. TheCentre had earlier decided to delay the procurement of paddy under MSP to October 11 in Punjab and Haryana is in the “overall interest of farmers and consumers as well as to accept paddy stock as per FAQ”.“Procurement of paddy at high moisture content is fraught with risk of increase in damage percentage of rice grain. The grain will become vulnerable to shriveling, blackening, discolouration and prone to infestation. This may lead to rejection at procurement centres and would lead to distress sale of paddy and consequent loss to the farmers,” officials said, adding that the Haryana government had also written to the Centre intimating about the untimely rain and requested for relaxation in Moisture Content in the paddy.“The better course would be to harvest the paddy crop offered after a period of 10 days, that is after proper maturity then the problem of moisture in the paddy grain can be minimised. Accordingly, State Government of Punjab and Haryana have also been requested to advise their agencies to dry the paddy already arrived and further produce may be brought to the mandi after proper drying,” the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution said yesterday.According to officials, widespread untimely showers across Punjab and Haryana during the second fortnight of September have affected the standing paddy crop in both the agrarian states. The maximum temperature at most of the places has also been recorded below normal due to downpour.“There was heavy downpour on September 29 and 30 in some parts of the States of Punjab and Haryana. Because of the untimely rains, maturity of paddy grains is delayed,” they said.Quoting the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), officials said rainfall during September 2021 is 77% and 139% above normal in Punjab and Haryana, respectively.“On the basis of moisture content check by FCI’s regional offices at Punjab and Haryana, it was reported that paddy samples are having moisture ranging from 18% to 22% in Punjab and 18.2% to 22.7% in Haryana against the permissible limit of 17%.“Accordingly, to save farmers from inconvenience and to protect farmer’s interest, Government of India decided that procurement of paddy under MSP operation would commence from October 11 in Punjab and Haryana and advised all agencies to gear up dying to help farmers,” the ministry stated yesterday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-relents-after-protests-paddy-procurement-to-begin-in-punjab-haryana-from-sunday-319232

Read to know more||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 2Having covered some distance in the drive to cleanse river Ganga and consequent invigoration of ecology along its banks in the basin States, the Union Jal Shakti Ministry has made Chacha Chaudhary—the iconic Indian super hero of comic book series—the mascot of “Namami Ganga” to raise awareness on the importance of the river.In effect, the Namami Ganga, which had till now been a disembodied initiative of the Union Jal Shakti Ministry through National Mission of Clean Ganga (NMCG), will now have a face to it.NMCG Director General Rajiv Ranjan Mishra said it has been tied-up with Diamond Toons to develop and distribute comics, e-comics and animated videos centering Chacha Chaudhary.“The content will be designed with the objective of bringing about behavioral change amongst children towards Ganga and other rivers,” Mishra said.Diamond Toons produces the comics related to the character.चाचा चौधरी को भारत में कौन नहीं जानता! एक कार्टून कैरेक्टर जिसका दिमाग कंप्यूटर से भी तेज चलता है। अब नमामि गंगे के शुभंकर के रूप में चाचा चौधरी दिखेंगे। यह विशेषकर बच्चों को नदी स्वच्छता की मुहिम से जोड़ने का एक व्यावहारिक प्रयास है।#NamamiGange pic.twitter.com/sH5k9KVvGf  Iconic Chacha Chaudhary will be Namami Gange’s mascot.NMCG has been focusing on youth as part of its outreach and public communications efforts as they are the impellers of change.The character jumps out of the pages of the comics with his avuncular interventions marked by smart and innovative ideas having an uncanny knack of an effective detective to solve problems.Chacha Chaudhary will be characterised on themes and subjects to purvey nuggets of information on importance of the river, including with regard to environment,flora and fauna and the entire shebang that goes with ecology. It will be in a manner to effectively deliver the homilies, especially to the children and youth.   “Ganga invokes a sense of deep reverence, replete with religious and spiritual significance. It is laden with meta thoughts which are difficult to capture in bone-dry words,” a functionary of the Jal Shakti Ministry said. “Hence, the need for symbols.”Chacha Chaudhary can be useful in ground-level activation for Ganga rejuvenation.The total estimated budget of the Chacha Chaudhary project is Rs. 2.26 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/remember-chacha-chaudhary-from-your-childhood-days-now-in-a-new-avatar-read-to-know-more-319201
03-10-2021||---||PM questions opposition’s ‘intellectual dishonesty’on farm laws||New Delhi, October 2Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday defended farm reforms saying sections of the political class opposing the move were intellectually dishonest as they had supported the reforms when in power.Promising resolution of any disagreements farm unions may have with respect to the three agriculture reform bills, the PM, in an interview to a magazine, said, “If you look at those who are opposing the pro-farmer reforms today, you will see the real meaning of intellectual dishonesty and ‘rajneetik dhokhadhadi’.”The PM’s veiled reference was to the Congress-led opposition which has been demanding a repeal of the farm laws.I always look forward to healthy criticism and miss genuine critics: ModiSpeaking on the need for reforms, the PM said India shouldn’t be put in a situation where it had to wait any longer for things the country and its people were entitled to.“For this, big decisions should be taken and if need be, tough decisions should also be taken. In such a large country as India, is it possible to make a decision which is acceptable to 100 per cent people, asked the PM in context of farm laws that have led to a prolonged agitation by farm unions.He said those opposing the laws are not wrong and may have their own genuine concerns “but if the decision is in larger interest, then it is the responsibility of the government to implement such a decision”.Questioning politics on farm laws, the PM attacked political parties for “intellectual dishonesty”, and said if a party makes a promise and is unable to deliver, that is one aspect the party must improve upon.“But there is another aspect which is completely different from this and is particularly undesirable and, I would say, detestable trait in certain sections of the political parties. This trait I am talking of is the trait of intellectual dishonesty and ‘rajneetik dhokhadhadi’. There are political parties which will make grand promises before elections, even put them in their manifestoes. Yet, when the time comes to deliver on the same promises, these parties and people do a complete U-turn and worse, spread the most malicious kind of misinformation on the promises they themselves had made,” said the PM.He said these were the same people who wrote letters to chief ministers asking them to do the exact same thing that our government has done.“These were the same people who wrote in their manifesto that they would enact the same reforms that we have brought. Yet, just because some other political party, blessed by the will of the people, is enacting the same reforms, they have made a complete U-turn and in a brazen display of intellectual dishonesty, completely disregard what will benefit the farmers and only seek what they think will benefit them politically,” Modi said.He said the government was committed to empowering small farmers in every way.“On farm laws, the government has been saying right from the first day that on whichever point there is a disagreement, the government is ready to sit together and discuss those issues. Many meetings have also been held in this regard but no one till now has come up with a specific point of disagreement that we want this to be changed,” said the PM.Attacking the opposition, the PM said, “You can see the same ‘rajneetik dhokhadhadi’ when it comes to Aadhaar, GST, farm laws and even crucial matters such as arming our security forces. Promise something and make arguments for it but oppose the same thing later without any moral fibre.”In a no-holds-barred conversation, the PM said his approach is to run the government to build the nation and not to form the next government.“The politics of our country is such that till now, we have seen only one model in which governments are run to build the next government (sarkar banane ke liye sarkar chalayi jaati hai). My fundamental thinking is different. I believe we have to run the government to build the nation (desh banane ke liye sarkar chalani hai),” said the PM, adding that pro-poor and pro-business were not exclusive categories and both were working towards the same objective of empowering India.He said that in the eyes of the world, being prime minister and chief minister might be a very big thing. “But in my eyes, these are ways to do something for the people,” the PM added.PM QUOTESPEOPLE TRUST THE GOVERNMENT: When I make decisions, the common man feels that this prime minister understands us...This trust is not developed because of PR. This trust has been earned through sweat and toil. The immense mutual trust between the government and citizens has been the foundation for whatever we have been able to achieve in the last seven years.RAJNEETIK DHOKHADHADI: Don’t you think political parties were making a mockery of themselves when their members spoke about the need for a new Parliament, previous speakers said that a new parliament was needed? But if someone tries to do it, they oppose it by making some excuses, how correct is this?RAJ SHAKTI VERSUS JAN SHAKTI: There is a deep problem in the way many sections of our political class view the Indian people. They only see Raj Shakti and view the Indian people only through that lens. But they do not see the innate Jan Shakti in Indians; they do not see the skills and strengths, the ability and capability of the people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-questions-oppositions-intellectual-dishonestyon-farm-laws-319194
